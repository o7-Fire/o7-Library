plane-crazy 2023-01-02 19:59:12 nice mig ||<:trollface:775024642104229898>||
creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:15:50 So I've built a YB-35, Martin Mars, TU-95, and a flying (unfortunately not yellow) submarine. Any other weird aircraft I should make fly?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 23:30:53 A suggestion, if you want to slim down the prop a little bit, I'd suggest using control surfaces. It'd give the appearance of a (slightly) skinner prop and gives one the ability to paint leading edge wear if necessary.
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:07:25 I'd like to see that in action
general 2023-01-03 03:08:51 this feels like a The Dale moment
general 2023-01-03 03:10:14 you're got this entire thread of conversation as proof
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:18:09 With my little experience in Plane Crazy, I see no way how a radar would be possible without a player controlling it.

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:30:46 Here's the kicker, it doesn't!
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:31:33 I'd say it's quite the opposite.

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:35:01 Controversy of the century right here folks
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:37:11 Well now that we've deduced that the radar is in fact magic, let's go on with our lives doing whatever it is one might do.

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:38:41 Great, well then admit how your "radar" works.
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:40:00 Ah yes, English.
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:53 While the cow does outmatch the human in basic strength and movement, the human dominates the cow in intelligence.
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:47 Yes, yes it can.

general 2023-01-03 04:52:25 Do we have a photo of it?
general 2023-01-03 04:53:33 It's not a bad build, just a simple plane one could make to dominate pvp servers with the right pilot.
general 2023-01-03 04:56:05 Cut my man some slack, he's just trying to build a pvp jet.
general 2023-01-03 05:02:06 Let's take bets on how long my YB-35 will survive in a pvp server.
general 2023-01-03 05:02:15 No armor, no guns. Massive flying wing.
general 2023-01-03 05:02:37 I will be.
general 2023-01-03 05:03:41 Let's see, I'm in a server currently.
