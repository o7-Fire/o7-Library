plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:52:53 There’s probably a rank that is slightly connected to that, and if a mod or admin was told they might give that rank so wouldn’t be so sure

creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:13:02 Yes
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:15:03 In plane crazy I kinda enjoy doing plane crash and rescue roleplays with my friends in our WW2 vehicles, anyway, I hate it when I go to bailout and get flung into the next galaxy over. The creators need to fix parachutes I. That game.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:17:11 <@!664158287800958978>  those things are paper thin, at least the one you built is, so taking a front view pic isn’t gonna work, we need a top and bottom pic, and maybe a parked with landing gears out pic.  Much better
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:19:53 I made my I-15 be able to look like it’s on fire and it has a oil leak simulator thing, I also made some parts of the plane disconnectable for fire damage and when the plane is being shot at.

general 2021-02-24 21:41:28 Texas has probably got more guns then your whole country
general 2021-02-24 21:41:58 I will inform Texas to salt everything
general 2021-02-24 21:42:03 Which technically isn’t good
general 2021-02-24 21:42:12 It would ruin their entire land scape

general 2021-02-25 02:34:33 About an hour ago some little fucker (12 years old) was riding with his fiend and I was picking up groceries, riding my skateboard home, they are riding skateboards to, I’m riding down a sidewalk and kinda zone out anyway suddenly I’m on the ground my eggs the milks and the chicken are across the ground, milk splattered and eggs decimated. I begin to get up, my knee poring blood, the kid says I’m not joking “well that just happened” his friend giggles and they ride away. I’m now sitting here typing this, my nose hurts like hell and my knee is still bleeding just not as bad. I got bandages and stuff on, I was in boy scouts when I was younger so I kinda had a vague idea of what to do in that situation to slow the bleeding. I can’t believe the audacity of kids. My nose isn’t broken because when I fell I dropped my groceries and some how landed in a push up position using my arms to suspend, my nose still hit the ground but at least not as hard
general 2021-02-25 02:35:10 And I’m not going to be in for a while I gotta go to the hospital
general 2021-02-25 02:35:11 Bye

creations-chat 2021-02-25 20:34:58 Yea
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:53:31 Wait does it look like on the outside before being spawned, or is all the motor locks on the inside not affecting the outside look? Also finally a normal question, how many blocks is that?
general 2021-02-26 14:39:55 Hey does anyone have any ideas for an absurd looking WW2?Plane medium bomber to fighter.
general 2021-02-26 14:41:04 Thank you
