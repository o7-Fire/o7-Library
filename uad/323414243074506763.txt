creations-chat 2019-02-07 16:24:46 ``` [Mil-24 'Hind']```
The Mil Mi-24 (Russian: Миль Ми-24; NATO reporting name: Hind) is a large helicopter gunship, attack helicopter and low-capacity troop transport with room for eight passengers. It is produced by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant and has been operated since 1972 by the Soviet Air Force and its successors, along with more than 30 other nations.

Blocks: 747
Speed: Stated to be around 450 SPS at full throttle. 

Features:
-2 Pilot seats and 6 Passenger/Paratrooper seats on the belly.
-2 Working doors at the sides, to let Paratroopers get inside.
-4 Rockets and 2 Rocket pods.
-1 Working Anti-Personnel/Anti-Terrain Minigun, working both Horizontally and Vertically.
-Non-coaxial helicopter (Means it doesn't have another rotor ontop of the main one to reduce the horizontally spin)

This toke quite a while to build, specially because I had to set every motor and Engine so that it would stabilize the Helicopter automatically. Then I had to train and make it fly well, because it can fly, but requires quiet the attention and skill.

creations-chat 2019-02-17 17:15:08 [M1 "Kamov" Abrams]
This is just a joke fusion between an Abram and a Ka-50 Kamov, 
The first one being a Medium Advanced support tank, the other being a Russian Coaxial Helicopter. This doesn't have really that much manouvrability, So I had to use Rocket Engines, still, the propulsion is given by the Rotors, and... nothing, downvote this if you want, it was just a Joke made for <@296280922771292170> that asked me to build a VTOL Abrams able to do the Cobra Maneuver, lol.

Features:
-Flying Artillery, with a firepower similiar to a Gunship
-Is able to move virtually on any terrain, as the Rotor can be de-attached from the tank body.
-Working Turret...
-THE PUWAR OF MURICA

creations-chat 2019-03-06 22:02:06 Helicopters have an higher manouvrability than airplanes, and instead of flying ontop of a creation, they can just stop, and if the guy goes after them, they get over the edge
creations-chat 2019-03-06 22:03:22 Doing the opposite thing, (Putting rockets downward) is quite unefficient, on helis, since the rockets needs some time to shoot. You must have either a good computer, Connection and at least more than 30 FPS to shoot correctly a rocket, and still, with a few decims of seconds in delay

help 2019-03-08 05:21:54 The rocket must pass within 5 blocks (approximately) from the creation. How far are you (except when you are out of the rocket's range) doesn't matter, nor your speed.
I also stated that rockets can be intercepted using Guns, this includes your own guns so a nice idea would be to don't put a rocket and a Gun on the same row
help 2019-03-08 05:23:02 If the turn is too high to do, the rockets will miss, or if the enemy is a static turret, they will start spin around it

creations-chat 2019-07-24 16:14:13 [**Cluster Missile**]
Owner: TheLastGamersYT
Block count: 25 blocks
Currently used on: AC-130

Description: This compact 3x5x3 missile has a high versatility, useful to hit both Air-to-Ground targets and as a 'barrier' from planes, enhancing the probabilities of hitting and doing some damage. It has a lower-than-average speed due to the hard punching payload, for a total of 6 bombs that spreads in a rose in 3 different directions for a quite wide range. 
The central block explodes, spreading the other 3 TNT blocks free to fly to their objective. Single bombs still have a partial manouvrability thanks to the fins placed to fly the missile.

bug-reports 2019-08-02 23:48:39 <@311996873650995200> you can fix it if the owner dies or respawns their creation.
bug-reports 2019-08-02 23:49:10 Blocks will regain physics if a player touches them directly
bug-reports 2019-08-02 23:50:05 If you have a really agile vehicle you can shred the enemy's vehicle to small pieces and eventually the bigger creation will re-appear in flight
bug-reports 2019-08-02 23:50:35 This because the small pieces gets 'dragged' by the main creation that is in contact with the enemy player

help 2019-08-10 20:46:58 That has been a shitty idea
creations-chat 2019-08-11 08:42:21 You understand that a thing called dissymetry of lift makes your helicoprererter flip over, right?
and the only two ways to counter it are either making a swashplate or using Coaxial props, right?
(Without counting the rockets, that doesn't counter it, but simply fixes the roll)
If you make the two props counter eachother, there will be a dissymetry all on one side, if you make them go the same way you will flip and roll because one swashplate has a dissymetry on the left and the other on the right.
creations-chat 2019-08-11 08:42:36 Also, Chinooks aren't coaxial, they are Tandem

creations-chat 2019-08-20 20:33:14 **[TLG-Sparrow]**
Owner: TheLastGamersYT
Block Count: 419
Max speed: 638 SPS flying horizontally, 634 flying vertically UP, 659 flying vertically DOWN.
 Description: A futuristic Low orbit jetfighter that I just built out of blue without a reference.
Features:
-Full VTOL (Can vertically climb smoothly)
-Zero-gravity, when left uncontrolled it will not go up nor down, and float in mid-air (Though slightly affected by Inertia.)
-Turret-like function, when in 'Zero gravity' mode, it can be used as a turret, as it will stay on place during Roll-Yaw-Pitch movements
-RCS made from Snow blasters allows the spacecraft for Chirurgical movements even in tight spaces. (The RCS is connected to the Num pad, allowing 3DM)
-Strategical sight allowing for a minimal bullet drop calculation.

bug-reports 2019-09-10 08:02:31 So if you put 20 on Torque it will get to 30 because it gets overwritten by the Angle

Owner: TheLastGamersYT
Block count: 381
Desc: A light and agile Armed helicopter, massively used during the Vietnam war and by the USMC until the AH-64 Apache replaced it. As of now the AH-1z is used mostly by the Marine due to it's light weight and ability to operate in harsh conditions.
Features:
-A frontal turret able to hit in a angle of 95 degrees (Slightly less than the original model).
-Able to hover
-Non coaxial (Rocket stabilized, a swashplate would ruin the design)
-Nilo Crocodile camo

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 12:16:53 I think make the Motor 2 a simple Motor
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 12:17:00 so you don't have to switch it everytime
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 12:17:19 And to give the Motor a max angle
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 12:17:37 Normal motor can turn 360 and indefinitely, while Motor 2 with a max of 180

bug-reports 2019-11-29 13:28:01 Also, another small build tilts heavily on it's left upon spawning and then doesn't lift up, as if the left wing is something that pulls down the whole creation.

Both of them make use of Helium on the main body.

Block count: 493
Max Speed: Over 700 (Still testing, I am sure that it can go faster)
Features: 
-4 Light turrets able to pierce trough heavy hulls.
-2 Major shields to protect the main engine from incoming missiles and gunshots.
-Has a double ring. The shields turn around the main axis of the ship, while the smaller ring that has the turrets turns the opposite way. This has been made to counter the torque generated by the smaller ring.
-No blind spots
-Extremely fast

Trivia: 
-The original name of this ship was Gygas due to the light colors that made it blend with the sky. It has been then discarded and used Icicle instead.

creations-chat 2020-02-25 10:31:33 <@456226577798135808> I personally ignored it, but I can list some of your problems on that:
-It lacks any color
-It is not really that original, alot of people made a machinegun already.
-The barrels look just too thin for something this huge.
-It spits out balls while bullet casings are kind of cylinders.
creations-chat 2020-02-25 10:32:49 It doesn't
creations-chat 2020-02-25 10:33:03 It says just 'I made a working machinegun'

creations-chat 2020-02-25 13:45:54 Also, I am quite sure that is a semi auto pistol since it uses pistons

Modified from the turret I already made.

Desc:
Mine Jorthbro here, introducing the most requested Plane Crazy Portal fanbase creation, the Turret Core. This innovative core has a modified (Filled with bullets) shell and mounts a double minigun. To make it work we sticked in it a Sentry Turret personality chip and mounted the whole thing on the new TheTurretCoreParableAdventureManagementRail™
able to move around the map thanks to the portal technology.

Comes in 5 different variations and over 500+ colors.

Contains small parts, do not let your children play with it.

Arctic, People don't like Cubes and 1x1 Wedges alone, you should try using 1x2, half wedges etc...

Herr, The helicopter is kinda passable, below the standards of this server but passable, the Concorde is however... weird It has something off, maybe it is the duck nose of both the creations (Usually people like to see Taller than wider noses even if they are against the original design, I had to pay for that with my AC-130 Which had the same problem)

Block count: 780
Desc:
Just a stealth drone based off the B-2 and the RQ-170. 
It is armed with a super-heavy payload of Lock-on missiles.
Features:
-Retractable Rocket pod launcher (I do not use it because it has the little perk of blowing up 9/10 times)
-Variable geometry wings.
-It can go from 12' to 6' in a second thanks to a maneuver similiar to the Pugachev's Kobra.
-Can hit targets in a sphere of 360° in all the XYZ Axys.

creations-chat 2020-03-14 18:17:08 Flapping means swaying the wing left to right to change the amount of lift there is on the 'plane' of the wing
creations-chat 2020-03-14 18:17:52 Yeah, that is flapping
creations-chat 2020-03-14 18:18:05 it is bad to move the wing around

plane-crazy 2020-03-26 15:01:14 I'd like to make it pretty much clear for people wanting the option to make custom blocks. 

As of now, Rickje will pretty much never implement that kind of stuff, because:
1) It would mean totally ***king up our current build slots
2) Such an update would take a total remodel of the game
3) Commands wouldn't be anymore as intuitive as they are now, making Plane Crazy some sort of ripoff from BYM
4) Each block would need to contain alot more informations per-block, forcing your total 260k data worth of stuff to be limited for just 3-4 builds. 

I really don't want it, unless Rick creates a new game don't wait for this update, ever. Go play BYM if you are really wanting that much this kind of stuff <-<

creations-chat 2020-03-31 15:36:03 maybe the wings are too small
creations-chat 2020-03-31 15:36:17 like, the main body is too long

Description: Remember that one post from one year ago when I said 'WYP spoiler', here it is, 1 year late, here it is the Chibi Angel of Death! Full of working guns, pylon turning, yawing and flare systems, plus, the frigging machineguns smoke. It is 100% better than my old AC 130

creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:07:21 .-.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:08:25 For reference
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:19:39 Alright, 200 SPS is pretty slow for a jet, but it is not the thing. Do not use the game given control panel thingies for show builds (Basically the ones that prefer aesthetics over functionality itself, and which usually get more upvotes). The plane is unbalanced, large wings with middle fuselage setting and rudder high horizontal stabilizers, they make your plane do sharp turns, usually planes with this setting tend to do flips when the rudder is damaged.

From the aesthetic point of view:
The wings are filled with holes, the nose is a straight cone, not not smooth, the canopy let's the pilot uncovered from the sides, might be functional in real life but to see isn't really, meh.

As a first build it is average though, it is made to test the game.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:20:38 Oh yeah, about the rudder high stabilizers, if you hit the rudder you take out the stabilizers aswell, that is why what I said happens.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:28:42 scary

It si great for stunts, but you will lose the ability to Strafe, plus you will lack the ability to control the Yaw and you will start drifting sideways if you turn

general 2020-04-09 08:17:33 A gravity slide absolutely gives an edge in PVP
general 2020-04-09 08:17:56 You can just fly weightlessly without needing to balance a shiton of helium
general 2020-04-09 08:18:40 But unlike the jetpack it is helpful while flying, it is not just aesthrtical
general 2020-04-09 08:19:09 The slider is just like as if Rickje added a paid 'Gravity controller block'

just, it would be awful in real life
the-dump 2020-04-12 08:53:48 Scienc
the-dump 2020-04-12 08:58:19 Plus you are using a pushing configuration turboprop with SIX blades behind four wings. There are 4 parasitic drag points that create turbolence and then you use 6 blades which require some extra power to spin, then...

the engine is located in the main hull, causing it to take space for the passengers or the cargo... the wings would break apart if the gears were located on them and the plane would flip if they were too close to the hull (Without counting they would literally scrap on the ground due to the impact-land force)
the-dump 2020-04-12 08:59:43 If there is a thing I learnt from SimplePlanes is that you should never let your wings fall below the hull

creations-chat 2020-04-17 08:12:25 [Light Delivery System - Praetor]
Blocks: 896
Max speed: 300~
Description:
A light Dropship VTOL aircraft able to deliver up to 10 armed personnel and heavy cargo. Under the belly it has attachment rails to carry extra cargo such as a container or weapons.

Used by the Deus Ex Machina personnel to move and to carry parts of their mech.

Features:
-Working landing gear.
-Working turret.
-Working doors.
-Stable hovering, 10 seats for the personnel, a large cargo bay and a 2 pilot tandem configuration. Not configured for fight but able to defend itself against personnel thanks to a front machinegun. 
Extra: The engines move with Motor 2 and are able of independent movement, this gives extra mobility and negates the use of engines on the front or the tail to Yaw. lol =w=

creations-chat 2020-04-17 11:48:54 <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-04-17 12:05:19 Because B2s, unless you make them whole, are generally not well seen, because they have lots of holes in their wings and most people make them like flying pancakes with holes.

A-10s because it is a way too popular tutorial and you cannot tell the difference between a tutorial and not. (Look at my A-107 and you'll understand wgat I mean)

Generally they are both tutorials.
Apaches... well, I have bad memories with those...

creations-chat 2020-05-12 20:56:23 The hard part is making it work without rockets
creations-chat 2020-05-12 21:05:26 The front can be filled with rockets or, if not for requesting a rank, helium in order to balance it's weight
creations-chat 2020-05-12 21:06:02 the back doesn't change the balance at all since it is leaving all of it's weight right upon the center of mass

bot-central 2020-05-12 21:21:34 The 4 horsemen of shame
general 2020-05-13 14:50:30 Disappointing
general 2020-05-13 14:50:37 Rick you are a failure
general 2020-05-13 14:51:41 
general 2020-05-13 14:51:46 Let's DM Rick with this
the-dump 2020-05-13 14:51:52 
general 2020-05-13 14:52:07 funny
general 2020-05-13 14:52:40 It shouldn't have been a paid feature AT ALL
general 2020-05-13 14:52:53 It ruins the game to be honest
general 2020-05-13 14:53:05 You can mute trolsl anyway
general 2020-05-13 14:53:06 so why bother?
general 2020-05-13 14:53:43 Honestly Rickje has became a scum lately
general 2020-05-13 14:53:56 greedy
general 2020-05-13 14:54:09 Yes
general 2020-05-13 14:54:12 hello rick
general 2020-05-13 14:54:13 =3
general 2020-05-13 14:54:32 Are we going to speak about the Gravity slider?
general 2020-05-13 14:54:41 That one DOES give an edge
general 2020-05-13 14:55:07 But VIP servers are VIP, unless someone invites you technically it is still paid
general 2020-05-13 14:55:17 plus it does give an edge in public servers
general 2020-05-13 14:55:34 .
general 2020-05-13 14:58:31 I mean, Rick does deserve money, just, don't add gamepasses that give unique features.
general 2020-05-13 14:58:36 Jeez.
general 2020-05-13 14:58:52 Because we are all complaining about him
general 2020-05-13 14:58:55 Muahaha
general 2020-05-13 15:00:07 Rick, Survival Servers, when. We are still waiting for the minigames XD
general 2020-05-13 15:00:40 <@!435864400235200522> I can technically buy the thing, just, meh, it is a pain
general 2020-05-13 15:01:15 How Rick said that PC was going to be F2P and no P2W/UnlockBEPICFeatures
general 2020-05-13 15:01:39 *brein*
general 2020-05-13 15:01:52 but it can be P2B
general 2020-05-13 15:01:58 B standing BASS
general 2020-05-13 15:02:11 Since that with speakers you can create EPIC BASSLINES
general 2020-05-13 15:02:28 Because the Tipjar is useless and it is a 'tip'
general 2020-05-13 15:02:56 the Tipjar IS useless overall, it doesn't add anything that you can use properly
general 2020-05-13 15:03:07 just minor detailing
general 2020-05-13 15:03:16 bruh
general 2020-05-13 15:04:05 You cannot make me shut up without a reason, it is not against the rules. Plus I am disappointed today. Making your day worse makes mine better, somehow.
general 2020-05-13 15:04:46 Nande.
general 2020-05-13 15:04:51 Why, that is unfair
general 2020-05-13 15:05:17 Mad is another ugly boi!
general 2020-05-13 15:05:39 *Let's make Mad give the ownership to Rick so we can get free speaker blocks*
general 2020-05-13 15:06:38 Not sure that you can convert Robux to Dollars
general 2020-05-13 15:07:24 *nande*
general 2020-05-13 15:07:40 And why is Madattak making money on Rick's work?
general 2020-05-13 15:08:10 I mean, isn't he the one getting the money at first, then gives a percentage to Rick?
general 2020-05-13 15:08:22 Mad has also some Official merchandise though

the-dump 2020-05-14 13:08:12 Welp, I already explained my motives
the-dump 2020-05-14 13:10:16 From a point where PC shouldn't had any gamepasses to the point we have 3 that give exclusive items, 2 of which affect creations, and 1 of those 3 affects them heavily. 1 produc (Tip jar) and 2 quick-unlock passes.

Please add an infinite fuel gamepass

the-dump 2020-05-14 13:18:01 The gamepasses are legit, but exclusive items are meh
the-dump 2020-05-14 13:18:35 Add some useless stuff like a quicksave color palette
the-dump 2020-05-14 13:19:01 that affects the building rather than the actual flight

Also pandas: Are genetically carnivore (Large bodies with a high mass to sustain, sharp teeth and bear-like claws) BUT they decide to be vegan.
the-dump 2020-05-19 08:37:26 Pretty much like humans, just, they are all like that.
the-dump 2020-05-19 08:38:10 It is like if your vegan mother decides to feed you off grass since your birth, and then you do it with your two children, and so they do with the next generations until everyone is a frugging vegan

plane-crazy 2020-05-28 09:14:37 
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 09:15:51 Anything can fly in this game to be honest
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 09:16:00 it only needs some wings and rocket engines
creations-chat 2020-05-28 09:24:05 Ugly
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:07 <@!439783199988514817> I can't deny it
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:24 but like, to make something 'Good in pvp' you can make this:
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:30 Build a block
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:37 add some wings to it
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:41 Spam rockets.
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:00:49 That is how you do
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:07:28 I mean, I use turrets for planes but whatever
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:07:34 Strafing makes you vulnerable
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:07:57 Are you guys having that issue aswell?
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:08:06 My terrain becomes all triangles and glitchy
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:08:16 Blue triangles
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:08:47 260 000
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:08:50 you moron
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:08:59 69570 out of 260000
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:09:53 It is a bit confusing, Europeans use a Comma to divide the numbers in hundreds, while Americans use a dot.
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:09:57 Or Vice-versa
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:10:00 don't remember well
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:10:19 It can
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:11:01 If you move faster than how the opponent can react, and you strafe or use turrets which of the two techniques has more chances of getting you hit?
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:11:48 If you strafe or use turrets, which of the two flight techniques gives your opponent more chances of getting you hit? At a 'superspeed' of 2000 or so.
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:12:15 To hit you while strafing a ground AA can just spam rockets in the air until you get hit.
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:12:33 Like, forward, toward you
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:12:57 No you don't. Technically rockets are flying TOWARD you, not flying AFTER you.
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:13:13 That is strafing you doe
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:13:29 if you strafe you must point your nose to the target, of course rockets will come from infront of you
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:14:17 Slow planes are good for ground attack, faster planes are for Air fights
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:14:27 can't really compare them at all
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:14:39 but for ground attack turretted planes are absolutely better than strafing planes.
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:14:54 Same for turrets
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:15:05 but for turrets you can simply Pylon turn on them and continue attacking
creations-chat 2020-05-28 10:15:33 more

the-dump 2020-06-13 07:10:55 Like, what the hell dude, why would you even place guns on both sides
the-dump 2020-06-13 07:11:19 they look cool and all, but 90% of the time those howitzers and miniguns on the right will point the air

creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:31:26 A roblox bug it seems
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:32:57 I can fix it by making my graphics over 8, but Plane Crazy becomes unplayable
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:36:11 <@!582834773773254656> it is a Roblox Studio bug, which gets transferred to the actual game
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:36:56 When the terrain color is modified from default color it turns the game like that when played from the launcher
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:37:21 So yeah, technically it is Rick's fault
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:37:44 The easter island for instance doesn't have that bug, probably because Rickje used the default terrain for it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:38:03 It is NOT Roblox client based.
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:38:14 It is a roblox update.
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:38:39 is it me or his PC is lookin' kinda T H I C C
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:38:43 I'm just sayin'
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:39:08 So like, how do I uninstall my client? XD
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:39:19 Do I delete both Roblox Studio and Roblox Launcher or just the RL?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 08:40:16 I just seen it, it looks like it is totally Rickje's fault, he has to replace the terrain completely.. .-.

general 2020-08-30 09:04:43 To be honest the no helium rule is mostly an annoyance and totally useless
general 2020-08-30 09:05:29 it can be easily exploited by just deleting helium in the craft and replacing it with normal blocks, take a screenshot and then reloaf the creation for the good in-flight pics
general 2020-08-30 09:08:27 Also, if that is not done, with the motor locks thing you can just clip 20 rockets into eachother and use them to " lightweight" the building
general 2020-08-30 09:09:02 Don't see why helium is frowned upon
creations-chat 2020-08-31 12:04:22 <@437152336176087052> Roblox texture bug
creations-chat 2020-08-31 12:04:34 it can't be fixed, must be a Roblox patch
creations-chat 2020-08-31 12:05:01 Actually, it can be fixed, Rickje has to delete all the terrain and replace it with the new one
creations-chat 2020-08-31 12:05:31 It happens when the terrain color is changed from the default one
creations-chat 2020-08-31 12:06:16 For example, the Easter Island doesn't have this bug because it ~~has been rushed up~~ it is made of default terrain

general 2020-09-12 17:36:03 <@!314383347214319616> Should I ping Rick for this?
general 2020-09-12 17:37:00 It is a Roblox update issue that can be fixed by Devs
general 2020-09-12 17:37:14 by deleting all the terrain and replacing it with new one
general 2020-09-12 17:38:49 Not sure how it works to be honest, but I was told by a fellow person that had this bug that it is due to some bug after a Roblox Update, we can either wait for Roblox to fix it, or have a massive poll for Roblox Staff to notice and fix this bug.
general 2020-09-12 17:39:13 Default color terrain isn't affected by the bug though, some parts of the Easter Island are just fine

<@456226577798135808> The last film
general 2020-09-26 18:56:50 I agree, Star Trek has a somewhat more freedom in expanded universe, without falling back to the cycle of 'Jedi big guys stronk'
general 2020-09-26 18:57:45 Star wars is somewhat a fairytale, there is the evil guy, there is the good guy, the good guy wins after an epic battle. The end.
general 2020-09-26 18:58:46 The best Star Destroyer class, and most original is the Gravity bending one, you know, the one that makes ship jump out of hyperspace
general 2020-09-26 18:59:35 Not gonna lie, The first 6 films and Rogue One are the most fucking dope shit I have EVER watched.
general 2020-09-26 19:00:24 4-5-6 and then 1-2-3 and then Rogue one, Solo, 7-8-9
general 2020-09-26 19:01:04 But 7 to 9 are crappy, while Solo doesn't add much to the story as I personally expected it to be
general 2020-09-26 19:01:19 if you want to have a good read, search for the Thrawn Trilogy
general 2020-09-26 19:01:45 It was technically considered Canon by Lucas himself, but then Disney fucked up everything up

general 2020-09-26 19:05:08 yeah, it was m ehm
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:39:45 so, here is a stupid question: Do bigger ailerons/elevators make you roll/pitch faster?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:40:45 and should I make a whole-wing elevator (All the rear stabilizer moves) or just a aileron attached to the stabilizer?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:41:39 just for clarity, myvwing resembles somewhat the one of a Sukhoi t 50
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:42:08 The lenght is about 2/3 of rhe main wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:42:36 Pitch*
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:43:09 it doesnt produce yawing though
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:43:24 roll makes your plane yaw as we'll
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:43:35 autocorrector 101
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:44:53 if you remove the vertical stabilizers come here and say it again aloud
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:45:50 having a vertical stabilizer and a yaw is totally different
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:46:13 talking to smol
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:46:47 I mean, with a small enough vertical stabilizer you will yaw
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:46:51 it has 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:47:22 they are not vertical, they are inclined of 20-30 degrees inward
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:50:40 from an aerodynamic point of view I think inclined stabilizers make your yaw worse but increase pitching speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:50:51 and roll
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:58:47 this thing would blow up so badly
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:59:19 medium tanks with fat powerful guns would just do the trick
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 04:59:35 this is a TD after all, right?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:00:20 Kinda unefficient on rough terrain, extremely heavy, low belly protection
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:00:39 laughing in 500lb bombs
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:01:09 Even scattering shells exploding below it would make the trick

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:55:36 Senryu in deploy mode
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:55:52 the colored blocks are used for gun convergence
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:56:35 Green ones are 0 convergence, blue ones are for 100 studs, red is point blank, orange -> yellow are 50 studs.
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:57:10 Camera locking is great but it's tricky to master, unlike motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:58:45 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:59:08 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:59:10 See?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:59:20 it's used to maximize damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 07:59:30 and spread out the fire
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:00:15 Nah, that's cheating
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:00:34 Using turret motor2 is cheating.
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:00:40 gotta keep the turret steady
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:00:57 the best way is to camera lock it on a 'reticle'
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:01:19 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:01:29 these are my guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:01:48 meh it's not an issue as long as your creation isn't based on camera locks
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:02:09 you can just place a block and reaim it at a block, easier
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:02:13 plus it's less likely to break
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:02:29 and faster to change your convergence based on the target
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:02:41 .
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:03:22 stonkers
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:03:42 you can use small hitbox items to do it too
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:03:47 like wing lights
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:04:04 they change the camera lock very slightly
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:04:31 beams aren't as efficient
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:04:46 nope, beams don't do that
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:04:57 if you point at a beam it will always aim at the perfect center
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:05:41 for the 7 beam aims at the 4th block while the 4 beam aims between  2nd and 3rd block
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:05:59 tested
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:06:02 maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:06:19 a motor has an entire block hitbox
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:21:43 to move through creations do you drag or use the wheel?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:21:50 *very important question*

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:25:16 just 48 votes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:25:19 I'm sad
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:25:52 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:25:59 47 actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:26:41 -. _-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:26:54 but 48 is with the vote in
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 08:27:00 so 48 -1 = 47

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:19:26 A motor-parachute-tnt bomb
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:19:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:19:41 yep.
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:19:43 it is you
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:19:49 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:20:01 it's definitely a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:20:17 you did it for the purpose of lag not because it's an effective bomb
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:20:36 besides, I'd like to see screenshots of these 10+ people having that plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:21:18 Why would you ask me if I used a tutorial on a complex and motor locked plane?
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:22:22 yeah. It's not a tutorial for 2 reasons: 
1) The anime it comes from is literally unknown to everyone in this whole server, change my mind.
2) It's complex af, uses both camera locks and motor locks.
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:22:56 you are very cringe no caps
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:23:18 for 2 reasons:
Lag bomb, you used the thing you wanted to destroy in the end
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:23:27 aka a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:23:41 plus you go around accusing people of tutorials and inventing things
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:24:13 you said you seen 10+ people with my same creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:24:22 I see that as bull###
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:24:40 I built my plane in 1 day
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:24:52 yesterday, monday 6th April
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:25:15 so unless you seen me 10 times in a row, at 10 different times, it wasn't me
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:25:32 that's some high level stalking
creations-chat 2021-04-06 09:36:45 The car's shape seems a bit off for some reason, the car doesn't have the curves it should have and instead has a somewhat blocky nose. You should fix the width of the car and make it slightly wider, since it seems rised from the ground. And final and most important: None likes to see Phone buttons.
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:38:40 you can use white circles signs + clipped sparklers on a 0.9 block
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 09:38:53 to vary the size

creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:12:43 <@642324788429324301> aren't those just some fancy motors, one with a speed of 1 and the other of 0.5..?

the-dump 2021-08-12 17:53:50 yes
creations-chat 2021-08-16 08:06:12 Should I add guns/rocket turrets in the back wings or more propellors? Which would look cooler?

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:39:17 Old vs New Dragonfly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:39:29 Nice revamp?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:41:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:41:27 it's totally silent
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:41:34 Hover driven
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:42:00 
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:42:06 perfect hovering
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:42:51 Try using a Half block
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:43:14 or rocket pods
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:43:26 so it looks like a hardpoint and hides away the motor lock
creations-chat 2021-08-16 09:57:07 I got lazy and just skipped the coloring part. Any tips?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:00:02 👍

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:12:43 <@!582834773773254656> I was aiming on making it look like neon
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:12:58 Or it is too much contrast?

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:17:28 he is a loser, let him be
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:18:22 I can tell the epic story of how I rekt him and teabagged with my big brein
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:18:38 Also, take a really fast plane, pack it with TNT and a Turret gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:18:51 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:19:11 Maaan

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:19:34 rejoin elsewhere, it's that easy
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:19:59 Yeah, I was gone for a year kinda but I still got the touch for unique stuff

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:19:28 thx
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:55:08 See if you can do anything about that motor hanging on the right side.

AKA make sure to take a screen on the  right side not the left once you submit
creations-chat 2021-08-16 12:42:15 Can I feel proud of myself for being still able to get a 100% Upvote-Downvote Ratio with a build that has almost no locks in it?

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:50:50 "Extreme force proof"
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:50:55 Pathetic
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:51:13 Break the rope using motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:51:14 ez
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:51:41 and now I can hear rick saying somwthing likw' That's not how you are supposed to play the game
general 2021-08-19 21:10:08 I only hope that the building plots keep their unique Voxel-type building. It is so much easier yet trickier to build like that
general 2021-08-19 21:10:50 ~~Your girl knows what to do with it~~
general 2021-08-19 21:11:49 Is it just big beams kind of affair?
general 2021-08-19 21:12:04 whoops sorry for the ping
general 2021-08-19 21:12:46 Noh.
general 2021-08-19 21:13:13 Plots won't get bigger, Rick said it alot of times.
general 2021-08-19 21:19:39 Will you fix motors breaking if locked?
general 2021-08-19 21:19:46 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-08-19 21:20:04 remember the days when Rickje said: "Motors aren't broken"
general 2021-08-19 21:21:57 All the servers use the same Seed for generation
general 2021-08-19 21:25:11 Might aswell be infinitely generated for real, and they all use the same seed to generate

general 2021-09-11 13:26:05 <@!886237077887406080> raiding is not cool
general 2021-09-11 13:26:11 <@!886237077887406080> same as mass pinging
general 2021-09-11 13:26:30 The pinger
general 2021-09-11 13:26:48 the pinger copied his name and now is pretending to be others
general 2021-09-11 13:27:01 unlikely, you have roles
general 2021-09-11 13:27:18 ok ok
general 2021-09-11 13:27:30 let's raid him back with DMs, but in a non aggressive way

the-dump 2021-10-29 15:45:46 the live says '23 hours ago'
the-dump 2021-10-29 15:46:32 As soon as I saw the site down I said: It must be Adopt Me's Halloween update.
general 2021-10-29 15:49:02 <@!217336009455566848> Sorry for the ping but I think this is quite important, you should make an announcement to not join the game sinec Datastores are breaking down.
general 2021-10-29 15:49:29 I got my data reset in another game
general 2021-10-29 15:49:47 What the fuck

general 2021-10-29 15:52:09 They have 4k active despite roblox not even loading
general 2021-10-29 15:52:22 I think something sketchy is up to them ngl
general 2021-10-29 15:52:27 like, what the fuck man
general 2021-10-29 15:52:50 All of roblox is basically dead, but they have 4k people playing.
general 2021-10-29 15:53:41 It is up to Rick to pay him back if the request didn't go through.
the-dump 2021-11-24 21:20:57 yes, even a sphere has sides
the-dump 2021-11-24 21:21:14 what it doesn't have are faces
the-dump 2021-11-24 21:21:50 we can give earth sides only because we divide it with a coordinate system tho
