The Tale of leto4148 (335424882936512515)
general 2019-11-02 00:03:41 hey uh
general 2019-11-02 00:03:47 i kinda broke speed of light 40 times
general 2019-11-02 00:03:58 
general 2019-11-02 00:04:33 *breaking it 40 times is actual calculation, not random words
general 2019-11-02 09:19:29 
general 2019-11-02 09:19:54 4 billion 910 million sped
general 2019-11-02 09:23:42 
general 2019-11-02 09:23:47 i literally broke the speedometer this time
general 2019-11-02 09:30:40 according to my calculations
general 2019-11-02 09:31:06 in the picture on down i broke speed of light 2240248 times
general 2019-11-02 10:30:32 oh
general 2019-11-02 10:31:02 actually yes, mistakes were made because i thought its studs per second
general 2019-11-02 13:26:35 also more mistakes could be made in my calculations because im not sure how exactly long is stud
general 2019-11-02 13:27:22 on some forum post someone said that 20 studs = 1 meter, i based on that
general 2019-11-02 13:28:33 i really doubt that speed unit in game is cm per second
general 2019-11-02 13:59:42 so 1 speed unit is 30 cm per second
general 2019-11-02 14:43:19 so if stud is 30cm, i broke speed of light 15 times
general 2019-11-02 14:43:36 thanks for telling, this is a lot more trustworthy than that i broke speed of light 2 million times lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:23:50 is there any stronger proplusion engine in game than super rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:24:42 hm, i have heard about it
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:24:45 but i have never seen one
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 21:27:31 bruh
general 2019-11-23 23:26:50 bruh
general 2019-11-23 23:26:57 bruh
general 2019-11-23 23:28:43 shadowx55 more like bruh
general 2019-11-23 23:36:15 is it actually banned to spread my religion
general 2019-11-24 19:03:14 à´Ž
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 18:00:00 is there any way to avoid FPS drop from magnet engines?
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 18:01:24 or they just drop it so much for me
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 18:01:25 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:12:39 will plots on this game ever get bigger?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:13:06 yeah but folding is inpractical as hell
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:15:07 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:15:44 like when you make plane and you try to allign center of mass and lift or something
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:15:53 how do you do that when your entire plane is folding
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:23 well i mean it works but still doesnt seem so practical to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:33 like you could just make entire thing fixed together
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:35 on big plot
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:04 i guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 12:14:02 does winter wheel have more friction or something
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 12:14:33 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 12:14:34 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 19:34:40 is there a way to make motor return to original position
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 19:38:52 thanks
