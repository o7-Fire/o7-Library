general 2020-12-11 16:02:11 this game needs a search bar for parts .-.
general 2020-12-11 16:03:20 because i am not about to memorize where everything is just to be slightly more efficient, its not laziness its just making it quicker to build
general 2020-12-11 16:04:03 tired of missing and scrolling past things idc if its lazy :/
general 2020-12-11 16:04:15 ill still scroll past them, and miss them everytime
general 2020-12-11 16:04:42 my brain doesnt do think and my eyes dont do sight
general 2020-12-11 16:05:02 thats true but we dont talk about that
general 2020-12-14 00:10:04 please someone tell me the secrets of  making mechs walk straight
general 2020-12-14 00:10:16 fascinating, i cant believe i never thought of it before
general 2021-07-29 22:59:03 At high speeds is a spinning cutter better or a non-rotating one
general 2021-07-29 23:00:58 If i were to ram into someone at high speeds would a spinning cutter better or a non-rotating one be more effective
general 2021-10-31 07:16:42 I would like to inform everyone that the discord nose emoji looks like a rhino horn
general 2021-10-31 07:16:44 ðŸ‘ƒ
general 2022-05-03 21:24:25 Im using disconnectors to look like panels on the side of one of my builds, some arent removing the segment that sticks out though even though others with the same settings are, is there some sort of antilag feature stopping that or something?
general 2022-05-03 21:24:56 ok
general 2022-05-03 22:09:52 is there any way to fix disconnectors not disconnecting
