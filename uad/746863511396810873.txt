creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:19:03 How can you get so worked up over a Lego game? Anyways, that’s my opinion that nobody wanted. Goodbye.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:21:19 But it is, “just a game”.  It’s kinda cringe getting so mad over one.

<@774282335742591026> perhaps try angling the back more.  Other then that, I like it.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:24:44 Search up angling tutorials, it’s super helpful.  If you’re on PC, you may can just use cameras.  If you’re on mobile, use motors.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:26:47 And text blocks for more wheel detail, that’s if you’re really creative.
