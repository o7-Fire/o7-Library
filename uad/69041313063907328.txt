plane-crazy 2023-05-11 21:19:16 I just joined that chat after playing plane crazy for quite some time
plane-crazy 2023-05-11 21:20:03 I looked at the ranks and realized I meet the requirements to be a rank IV Rocket Engineer, Aero engineer, and like a level II VTOL Engineer
creations-chat 2023-05-11 21:24:24 If you want to increase your speed just a little bit, change out the signs for wing blocks and use motor2s for variable pitch so that you can spin them without creating thrust
general 2023-05-11 21:25:35 hi

creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:02:19 the front window looks very good
creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:14:44 <@636445104118431746> he is just a harsh critic
creations-chat 2023-05-12 04:21:27 I think so
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:06:34 Paint it
creations-chat 2023-05-27 08:06:07 Idk manâ€¦ I think thats a Cessna 172 Skyhawk with the ERAU Color scheme
creations-chat 2023-05-27 14:24:02 It seems they hate anything that isnâ€™t drowning in motor lock
creations-chat 2023-05-27 15:50:37 Thats a real tail number
creations-chat 2023-05-27 15:58:37 
creations-chat 2023-05-29 00:32:14 tell me everything you see that is wrong with it then?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 00:55:03 It is true that it never says Plane Crazy posts specifically, however it is under the Plane Crazy tab. This server is supposed to be just plain crazy though, so I guess it works.
creations-chat 2023-05-29 00:57:13 I am going to shove a 14x8 propeller so far up your ass I swear to god.
creations-chat 2023-05-29 01:00:19 master airscrew will do nicely, they work well usually
creations-chat 2023-05-29 01:09:00 Rules never specify that it has to be a creation made in Plane Crazy
help 2023-05-29 01:09:47 as in pitching up?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 01:11:15 thanks ill fix it
creations-chat 2023-05-29 01:13:18 Yep, dumbest of them all. My IQ is 0.5ðŸ˜œ
help 2023-05-29 01:23:20 is it balanced?
help 2023-05-29 01:23:49 that might be the issue
creations-chat 2023-06-16 00:02:50 Its a real tail number
creations-chat 2023-06-16 00:05:21 yes "interesting"
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:45:58 fuselage is hard to get right, I also tend to avoid motorlock in my other builds
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:48:09 I have no concept of angle locking
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:52:48 Dm me a video or 2 of it
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:05:16 So its just a motorlocked motor2?
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:07:20 That sounds so outrageously complicated, since you cant set the angle to a numbered value
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:10:35 Still i think i make aircraft that look good without it, still something to try though
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:15:57 Vs my jets and such which contain at most 2-3 motor-lock
creations-chat 2023-06-16 13:19:12 <@636445104118431746> the upvote is facing in the wrong direction
creations-chat 2023-06-16 14:04:11 At the point Iâ€™d rather work on my irl R/C planes
creations-chat 2023-06-16 14:50:12 Too much effort
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:07:45 I should repost my p-51
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:14:09 Be nicer about it and maybe I will.
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:16:16 No, but Iâ€™ll delete your brain cells for you. Would prefer method A or B? ðŸ˜Š
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:19:02 I think I get it now ðŸ˜ƒ!!! More motorlock equals more upvote, so if I build a giant block thats all motorlock, Iâ€™ll get infinite upvote!!
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:21:40 For you, anytime. Would you prefer to be shot in the head, shoulders, knees or toes?ðŸ˜Š
creations-chat 2023-06-19 16:24:07 So you need someone to help you carry heavy things? Aww dont worry sweetheart, Iâ€™ll help you carry your emotional baggage

creations-chat 2023-07-17 17:25:41 Lol
creations-chat 2023-07-17 17:28:51 Maybe a lil jealous but not mad.
Iâ€™m sure if I knew more than basic motor lock, my stuff would be better detailed
creations-chat 2023-07-17 17:31:36 Iâ€™m at work
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:50:18 Community upvotes based on the amount of motorlock
