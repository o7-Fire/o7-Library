plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:42:32 is that possible
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:42:37 because the conard wings need to be sm0l

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:44:51 that's
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:44:57 the over simplification of the century
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:45:03 that doesn't tell me how to do anything
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:45:24 Once again, the over simplification of the century

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:46:46 Yikes this is Galaxy discord all over again

plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:47:25 my first decent looking build
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:03 oh
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:07 that makes a lot more sense actually
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:18 t-72 right
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:37 like most russian tanks look similiar
plane-crazy 2022-05-07 13:49:49 can you blame me for thinking its literally *the most used russian tank*

general 2022-05-07 19:08:20 Hey
general 2022-05-07 19:10:45 "An easy and simple build, only took me about 6 minutes to make"
general 2022-05-07 19:11:28 did you actually build it or did you just
general 2022-05-07 19:11:37 ctrl+c ctrl+v
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:24:07 Hey can any jet makers help me out here?
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:24:12 How do I make my jet turn faster
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:24:50 wasd
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:25:31 yeah my roll rate isn't very high
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:25:34 and i want to make that higher
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:25:54 iirc, SA-37 VIGGEN is very maneuverable
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:09 well
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:13 uhhh
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:26 the wings are
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:27 very
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:28 big
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:26:30 on SAABs
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:27:42 also
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:27:47 on the rockets
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:27:51 what does close tracking do?
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:28:41 like
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:28:45 when they're REALLY close only?
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:28:55 they're not very good tracking
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:29:39 well
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:29:42 that'd explain why
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:29:45 they are 99% unguided
bot-central 2022-05-08 01:33:30 !rank
bot-central 2022-05-08 01:33:37 !rank
general 2022-05-08 01:33:46 hi
bot-central 2022-05-08 01:37:03 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:37:33 yeah but they have the turn rate of a stone
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:37:44 and besides
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 01:37:48 there's already cruise missiles
creations-chat 2022-05-08 01:49:21 How's my Viggen for a first build?
creations-chat 2022-05-08 01:55:43 What can I do better <:Hmm:937421617749983252>
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 02:02:16 Uhh, in English
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:06:06 This isn‚Äôt the first thing I‚Äôve ever built in any game ever. I‚Äôve played other building games, looked at many tutorials, and got help from other users. This is the first thing I‚Äôve ever built in plane crazy. I have done test flights in small test planes that are just some blocks, a jet engine, and some control surfaces, but i don‚Äôt think that counts as a build.
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 02:07:15 I meant with wings btw
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:08:33 Well, its pretty simple, I wasn‚Äôt using any motor locks or anythng. Most complex thing I used was the custom control surfaces. I‚Äôm not 5 btw
creations-chat 2022-05-08 02:10:22 Also, I spent many hours on this and have been working on it since last night.
general 2022-05-08 02:24:08 OH THAT REMINDS ME
general 2022-05-08 02:24:13 THERE EXISTS
general 2022-05-08 02:24:16 A MAGAZINE FED REVOLVER
general 2022-05-08 02:24:22 with ***TRIANGLE BULLETS***
general 2022-05-08 02:24:57 series 1100 Dardic
general 2022-05-08 02:25:55 OH THAT REMINDS ME
general 2022-05-08 02:26:02 THERE ARE MANY DOUBLE BARREL VERSIONS OF REGULAR GUNS
general 2022-05-08 02:26:14 DOUBLE BARREL AK
DOUBLE BARREL AR
DOUBLE BARREL FAL
TRIPLE BARREL SHOTGUN
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:48:40 So basically, people don't like builds that don't take 9 days to build
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:50:52 well, what did you think about my build anyway
creations-chat 2022-05-08 03:52:42 QUICK DOWNVOTE HIM BEFORE HE REALIZES IT DOESN'T MATTER!
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 20:15:02 Do wings inside blocks affect anything?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 20:15:10 or do they have to directly be outside the vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 20:16:03 ok good
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 20:16:31 ok that makes my build work a lot better
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 20:55:19 hey can someone who is good with motor locks help me out on a build
general 2022-05-09 21:04:47 what
general 2022-05-09 21:07:17 what, FURRY
general 2022-05-09 21:07:27 1 sec let me get "Loud_siren.wav"
general 2022-05-09 21:08:02 he is furry, as in covered in fur
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:25:15 WELL you gotta use motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:25:17 and motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:25:20 they scare me
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:26:21 try making a draken or viggen
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:26:24 those intakes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:26:28 yeah good luck on that

plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:38:04 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 21:38:19 well that complicates things
