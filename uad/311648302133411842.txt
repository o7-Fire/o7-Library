plane-crazy 2020-10-07 19:49:22 so I looked on the shredder bug with unbiased eyes
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 19:49:40 the chassis is really good for flying and/or spectating
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 19:49:47 but it’s just hella toxic
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 19:50:01 was able to half the block count and it still flies the same

Yes, this is certainly a road flattening vehicle used against main character and Protagonist Jotaro Jostar in part 3 of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure.

general 2020-12-14 06:16:08 and the event happens
general 2020-12-14 06:16:13 Will I get double fireworks
general 2020-12-14 06:16:38 hjkfnbfhsj
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 20:59:42 ok quick question:
if I buy the winter items now, will I get double if i complete the event once they’re out
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 20:59:54 k
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:00:06 yeah I figured
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:00:24 it unlocks them, not adding them to ur inventory.
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:00:34 whom
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:00:56 thanks, someone hated it so much they made an account to yell at me

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:03:36 he was losing the argument hard
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:03:44 and went on alts to "roast" me
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:04:09 he was mad that i disliked his "original use of 25 part count missiles"
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:04:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:04:45 I have a couple
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:06:09 should I upload a tutorial of my maus so when people call it a tutorial I can say “dude I literally was the one who made the design”
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:06:56 mine is so simple but it looks good and works
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:07:01 I just gotta remake it
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:07:05 to make a tut
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:07:14 yes they do
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 21:09:48 start adding random stuff that makes it stuck to where it looks like it works, but in the end cut to a working version that doesn’t have the parts that ruin it
general 2020-12-16 21:25:42 sparklepot
general 2020-12-16 21:30:04 Dm me if ur too lazy to find all the items

creations-chat 2020-12-22 04:29:42 this stupid plane somehow worked perfectly without any modifications after I built it blind
creations-chat 2020-12-22 04:35:31 1x2
it’s a much shallower angle than 1:1
creations-chat 2020-12-22 04:46:22 welcome
creations-chat 2020-12-22 05:01:26 feels like it needs a greenish tan
like a light tarnished bronze
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 05:50:21 I’ve seen people with them
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 05:50:57 well, “piston powered” where it’s just a motor connected to a crankshaft spinning fake pistons connected to a propeller
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 05:51:44 anyways


can anyone else agree that this game needs a serious map expansion 
like I can’t fly in one direction for more than 7 seconds with my planes  without having to turn around
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:06:47 it’s not cringe
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:06:52 it’s just S M A L L
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:06:57 like way too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:08:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:08:31 the ice also doesn’t help
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:08:42 I get it’s supposed to be seasonal but it just ruins it
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:32 map expansion
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:36 that’s all
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:09:51 maybe a brick built map like pilot training flight simulator
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:10:18 a big flat area for takeoffs in every direction
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:11:34 a stunt park thing with hazards?
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:11:59 I like the idea of a firework/flak  array shooting at you
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 06:12:09 or just straight up

the-dump 2021-04-08 04:27:42 oh no
creations-chat 2021-06-25 03:40:58 favorite part about taking screenshots is when you forget it saves the "screenshot taken" in the actual screenshot, and you forget to close the playerlist because your brain has gotten so used to it that it just forgets it even exists
