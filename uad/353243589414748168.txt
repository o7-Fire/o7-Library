bug-reports 2019-03-25 21:58:28 alright so im having a really weird one. i have a plane that in non-pvp mode works perfectly fine, but in pvp mode wont lift at all but otherwise functions normally.
bug-reports 2019-03-25 22:00:50 you can dm me if you need more information, i can easily record a video.

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 01:05:27 yeah

plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:08:11 see ya
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:09:20 also yeah koneko talked about that game and its pretty much a direct rip of speed simulator 2 with a few things like pets added <@!185171693566689280>
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:09:43 super dumb and doesnt deserve the top spot
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:04 i dont care how fast it grew
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:07 its garbage
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:10:30 uh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:14 maybe with the simulators and those shit games but ive made a list and counted, theres at least 70 good games on this platform
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:20 so
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:28 a handful basically
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:11:34 admittedly
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:12:00 its on there
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:12:28 i rated it a decent game
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:20 its a good game, but its unoriginal concept and lackluster selection put it lower on my list
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:48 yup
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:13:55 i played that game the other day
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:14:09 i put it under my 'to review' category
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:14:30 ive only played it for 30 minutes so i cant give an accurate review on it yet
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:15:02 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:16:45 and katze what i said about wings of glory doesnt show my full opinion on it, i was admittedly being very critical of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:17:52 thats some r/nocontext shit right there
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 08:21:23 i use them on my reentry vehicle to soften the final fall but thats about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 23:39:03 this is the ideal male body. you may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 15:57:13 hm
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 18:40:48 o k
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 16:59:37 rough draft of a proposal to rick
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:01:00 the thing is idra, is that were saying that **we** are gonna make it for him.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:02:25 alright
made it more clear that were gonna make it
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:13:36 new part of the proposal:

we feel like this new map would add tons of new replay-ability to the game, encouraging people to make newer, cooler, and faster vehicles to be able to explore easier. on top of that, vehicles that, currently, dont have a big enough map to be used to their full potential, (such as really fast jets, submarines, trains, or huge ships) will now be able to fully explore this new map.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 17:14:44 alright ive gtg, good luck guys!
and henkku, if you make any more drawings of the map, dming me them would be amazing. <@!263959626804887552>
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:25:57 alright, now all we can do is wait and hope.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:26:20 hm?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:26:25 which image and where?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:26:31 ah
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:30:19 robo, we have so many people vouching for us
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:30:25 including idra
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:30:39 so yes, while that is true, were not that far off.
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:31:18 did they say they were more than willing to do it all themselves?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:31:31 and all theyre asking from rick is permission?
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:32:07 fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 20:32:18 were still gonna try though lmao

plane-crazy 2019-12-06 00:58:03 when i press the throttle, theres three main issues
1. the half wedges that rotates collides with the anchor block
2. 1 of the blade parts falls down and goes pretty much limp, while the other stays straight
3. if i try to do much of anything besides the throttle, the thing spazzes out and dies, yes

creations-chat 2019-12-07 06:09:22 it looks decent, but theres also plenty of room for improvement
in terms of thrust: id suggest deleting the props of the front of the props and putting a bunch of super rockets somewhere inside the hull
i like what you tried to do with the vertical stabilizer, but it could use some enlargement and just generally more shape put into it
in the longer run, the wing to body ratio is off a little bit, id suggest either (preferably) putting folding wings, but another option is redoing the body entirely. 
in terms of firepower, you could really do with some turrets for your guns. id recommend using a simple and small motor 2 turret, but its up to you
besides that, the body is shaped quite well and the front is fairly well done given your experience level
anyways, hope this helped and good luck! <@!378632050539888651>
creations-chat 2019-12-07 06:10:00 *jeez thats a lot longer than i thought itd end up being*

creations-chat 2019-12-11 01:29:35 did some practice with my new color blending technique, i think it came out fairly decent.
creations-chat 2019-12-11 01:34:20 the top line of black to white got compressed by the saving 😔
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:01:40 yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:18 ooh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:21 little boat
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:02:35 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:03:42 but yeah they got compressed, making the blending much more jagged looking
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:03:59 luckily the main section is still fine
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:03 yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:32 i use rgb and i was like "wahd" cause it goes from 0 to 255
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:04:56 wh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:01 oh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:09 i know what you mean yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:30 generally i use r000g000b000 or hexadecimal
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:05:58 hex is really good cause its easy to convert back to decimal- oh
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:23 hex is like
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:33 #a0a0a0
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:35 is the code
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:45 for the middle one of the black to white line
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:06:58 brb
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:07:55 but yeah
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:08:35 hex is interesting because each decimal place goes from 0 to f, rather than 0 to 9 for our normal way of writing numbers
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:00 ffffff
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:03 well yes
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:09:09 wait no

creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:11:28 final answer
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:11:42 were talking about hexadecimal
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:09 im approximately 16.87682646575 years old
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:24 *dont ask me why i did the math for that*
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:12:59 well i was 16.87682646575 at 1:13:30 AM (EST) this morning
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:13:07 idk what i am now
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:14 idea
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:46 redo it, but with disconnectors
then, push all the disconnectors all together
boom you got super smooth blending
creations-chat 2019-12-11 02:15:55 **i said dont ask**
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 22:10:40 test what?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 22:13:45 grab are you playing terraria?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 22:13:54 oh shoot

plane-crazy 2019-12-22 22:15:00 im playing ranger, i got the minishark yesterday
creations-chat 2019-12-25 02:46:13 pretty good, but 1. some of the proportions are moderately off (height of cockpit, size of tail, etc.) and 2. the livery/camo is odd to say the least
but besides that, id say its got my upvote.

plane-crazy 2020-01-18 21:15:46 that even loops perfectly too
plane-crazy 2020-01-18 21:15:51 hot
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:00 the main wings and elevators are really misshapen, as has been pointed out multiple times
but besides that its pretty decent
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:33 and uh yeah
they look nothing like the f22 main wings lmao
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:53:47 p much
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 03:55:36 the overall shape is ok i guess
but theyre way too short, dont have anywhere near the proper angling, and are missing 1 of the 2 angle changes at the tip
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:01:52 definitely better
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:02:06 still should go further forwards though
plane-crazy 2020-01-19 04:02:24 the elevators are extremely wack now lmao

creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:46:35 if the front (green area) was the back of the ship, and the back (tan area) of the ship had any effort put into it, it would be pretty good
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:53:41 yeah
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:53:45 thats what im saying
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:54:12 the curve on it for it being a front is horrid, but if you made it into the back itd be good
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:55:00 the best thing you could do is rotate the superstructure 180* and make the back the front
creations-chat 2020-02-25 16:56:43 alright

creations-chat 2020-03-09 18:17:44 its a decent build, but you claiming that its a star destroyer is what made people (at least me) downvote it

general 2020-03-15 18:39:48 best way to do it is to put wings on opposing sides of your vehicle, and attach motors to them in a way so they fold out to face forwards <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-03-15 18:41:23 one sec yeah

creations-chat 2020-03-20 17:30:31 i suggest covering the entirety of it with disconnectors, and then coloring them. that way, you can get rid of those horrendous transparent streaks all over the vehicle. you should also delete some of the horizontal wing panels towards the back and replace them with the vertical wing panels so you dont need that tail section

general 2020-04-04 01:41:31 probably relates to the video above

plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:17:52 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:17:55 you drop them
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:18:05 theyre attached to disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:18:18 im probably gonna remove them anyways
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:19:04 yeah ok that looks a lot better lmao
definitely going to remove them
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:20:04 hm
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:20:12 that might be why its so wobbly
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:21:37 yeah the wings were pretty much meant to be temporary
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:21:53 i just wanted to get it to fly so i could test if it even works lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:22:43 if it were facing forwards, it would weld to the part on the locked motors and break it <@!340895447616978954>
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:22:54 actually wait
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:23:35 fixed it
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:26:03 yeah it flies a good bit better with fewer control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:26:16 time to work on making the wings *look* decent
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:28:08 trust me, id love to use motor2s
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 15:30:51 i actually quite like this wing design

general 2020-05-10 20:36:20 if that was more than 10x10 pixels, it would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:08:54 anyone know any way to make a camera be able to zoom?
i remember seeing a photo from prototrode/neutronium that showed it being able to do so
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:12:19 it produces some odd results while pressing c a split second before jumping out of the chair, but nothing like what he showed in the video
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:13:18 the camera position gets locked into the last place it was before you switched to the camera view when you do that
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:15 tried that, nothing of interest happens
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:36 actually nvm
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:49 ok so it works perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:51 except
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:14:59 you can only zoom out, not in
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:15:41 oh wait, now that i think about it that actually was what he did
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:15:45 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:24 it acts as if you were standing in the position of the camera
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:55 nothing really *that* crazy is going on
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:16:57 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:20:06 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2020-05-15 18:20:14 can we get this guy chat banned
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:52:49 why the hell is rick stressing over putting outlines back on blocks

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:43:44 very much a work in progress
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:43:51 dont even have paint on it yet
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:47:48 it looks a lot worse than it is, as long as you avoid going parallel to long dips in the terrain, it is really hard to flip over
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:48:39 racing in plane crazy is impossible to do if you dont have a third person due to the lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:48:51 the people in the vehicles will almost always think they are winning
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:49:18 the third person needs to tell you who won, since the latency will be the same for both people on their end
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 17:49:39 yes ik i am engris hman

plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:27:32 thats actually awesome
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:37:26 ok wtf
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:38:19 why do builds that actually have effort put into them go so negative and then shit like this gets more than 70 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:38:41 sure, it was a well timed comedy build, but it doesnt deserve 70 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 22:39:25 it does

general 2020-06-03 21:28:04 fabric is the material with by far the most friction
general 2020-06-03 21:28:33 if you need more friction, get more surface area of your fabric blocks touching the ground

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:07:12 wacky boing 747sp
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:08:00 yes that is how aerodynamics works
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:08:28 thats also how increasing your runway visibility works
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:08:29 i swear
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:09:46 that is true
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:40:30 oh that looks hot as hell
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:41:02 i love when people do buildings in pc
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:42:42 ok holy shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 16:42:54 thats utterly beautiful
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:14:28 which do you think looks better? (only difference is the bit on the wingtips)
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:14:29 
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:15:10 i agree yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 00:15:20 i feel like the wings look incomplete without them
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:06 for the iowa, most of it looks good
but ALL of the proportions are off, it goes too deep into the water, the fuselage is too short, the superstructure is too tall, etc
<@!280393446114590722>
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 02:24:39 should i post this in <#384025409945337856>, or wait until i have it finished and painted?

plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:34 so what exactly do the water blaster things do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:44 wait im dumb
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:51 someone asked like 2 seconds ago
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:33:52 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:12 they dont do any damage though..?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:29 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:35 the water effect on them looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:36:43 but i dont see much use other than that
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 00:37:18 that seems like something it might do
bug-reports 2020-06-30 00:03:22 the part for moving my build around is centered at the world origin when i dont have anything on my plot
not sure what caused it and i havent seen it before, but it doesnt negatively affect gameplay so idk
creations-chat 2020-07-01 03:57:56 <@!707728762841727038> overall id give it a 5.5/10, solid attempt
a lot of the shapes and positioning of the wings, elevators, and rudders are off, and the v shaped ones on the back are too close together
theres no bump near the back of the fuselage, and the general shape of the fuselage is just off
bug-reports 2020-07-01 22:00:04 rickde139

plane-crazy 2020-09-08 20:10:38 for making swashplates, is there any way to control pitch without using cyclic?
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 23:16:03 depends yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 23:17:26 jetpack is good for convenience, especially if you like making tall or large builds

plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:49:52 the jeep looks alright, but id say you should try and use a wheel assembly
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:50:14 a single suspension block and the wheel blocks arent very good to say the least
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:50:23 also idk whats going on with the turret

general 2020-11-19 00:25:41 i just played at 14 fps for like 20 minutes cause i was around massive builds and now im going back to my desktop at literally 10x the framerate and it feels weird
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:14:47 <@!634037409020903444> why :(
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:22:59 alright then im gonna downvote it too
because its not clear whatsoever is going on and you dont want to fix that
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:24:31 alright but its an easy fix to just explain whats going on and you refuse to do that
the build itself is like a 5/10 but that wasnt even your point, and you refuse to make it clear that its not your point
creations-chat 2020-11-21 21:26:10 alright but you didnt explain whats going on in it so no one knew what was even going on in the photo

general 2020-12-09 23:02:37 until i saw what you said a second ago
general 2020-12-09 23:06:14 ^
general 2020-12-09 23:09:16 it was amazing
general 2020-12-15 14:12:07 no, that game sucks so hard compared to pc lol
general 2020-12-15 14:13:10 i think the only real advantage babft has compared to pc is build size

general 2020-12-15 14:16:00 you cant even download it or anything
general 2020-12-16 01:28:52 what do we think is the likelyhood of the update actually happening on the 16th
general 2020-12-16 12:53:44 old le bote was so much better
general 2020-12-16 13:06:16 16th of december right? <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-12-16 13:06:55 alright
general 2020-12-16 13:09:27 woah what
general 2020-12-16 13:09:39 do i want to go in there
general 2020-12-16 13:09:45 or is it too much spoilers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:28:32 step 1. dont use default suspension blocks on their own.
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:28:54 the only time you should be doing that is when you have no other choice
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:29:06 nej
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:29:32 idk what that is
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:30:18 i found it in the background of a youtuber and thought it looked decent so i adjusted it to be 8x8 for symmetry and added a random made up word lo
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:30:36 its 7x7
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:30:45 8x8 is much easier to work with
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 01:30:52 and looks better with the text
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:16:53 thats way too detailed, itll drop lower powered computers frames really hard
from what ive heard, performance will be much more important to rick than super high detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:17:26 i know, but it needs to be kept super minimal
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:18:01 theres hundreds of parts just on the rail alone
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:18:33 that doesnt matter at all lmao
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:18:51 im not talking about collision lag
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:19:55 i would say dont have rails at all
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:20:07 itll put a hard cap on how big of a build you can use for it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:21:03 sure it looks cool, but most people will just think its annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:21:39 id highly suggest just scrapping the rails
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:22:09 alright, suit yourself
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 19:39:26 better, but i still really think the best choice would be to not have them
general 2020-12-26 00:53:31 "a-10 fighter jet" yes of course, the sub sonic jet with air to ground missiles, a gun with 30mm ap rounds, and a super thick turning circle is obviously a fighter jet
general 2020-12-26 00:55:39 possibly

contest-chat 2022-04-09 19:48:24 there is so much wrong with this
general 2022-04-16 02:54:46 lieutenant balls, ready for service
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:24:52 making a new attacker, only the front 25% is anywhere near done so far
what do you guys think?
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:26:07 fully retractable landing gear with suspension
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:26:19 nothing in particular, just custom
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:28:27 but yeah its no where near done, the wings are totally scuffed
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:28:40 just enough to fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:41:19 made the seal much nicer with some motor locked disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 02:49:00 and some more by tuning the pistons but im not gonna send a photo unless someone wants me to
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 18:18:18 front half is mostly done now
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 18:18:50 
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 22:32:40 which wing do you like more, the new one or the old one
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 22:35:25 lmfao
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 22:36:23 the tail isnt done yet obviously
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 22:39:36 id say the entire thing is around 80% done, still gotta finish up the wings, tail, and then paint it
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 22:45:39 i like the new one more
general 2022-07-08 23:27:27 hmmmyes
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:06:10 who else has over 700 hours and still sucks at building :)
(this is 704 hours)
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:06:43 1013 hours, niiiice
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:07:29 you like my wing? :)
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:08:03 fucking hell thats nearly 2500 hours
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:09:15 this wing right here is my favourite build
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:10:09 nothign else even compares to its beauty
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:10:53 holy cow i just realized i have over 150 motor locks on this build
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:11:00 most of them are for the bomb bay but damb
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:11:36 that makes this build literally 10% exclusively motors
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:12:27 
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:27:22 this is probably gonna be either my first or second best looking plane ive built so
its about 80% done so far and i hope its obvious what isnt finished
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:29:05 for reference this is the second place contender
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:29:34 much more stylistic
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:29:44 oh yeah thats uh
a bit wacky
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:30:22 i like smaller stuff but i wanted something bigger and a bit more capable
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:30:44 this one doesnt even have landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:32:00 i do really like the gun and double seat though, as well as the back part that seems to bulge out
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:32:16 ty
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:32:17 lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:32:29 that wasnt my first plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:32:35 thats the contender for first and second place
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:33:47 these two came first
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:35:33 the first one was just designed to be mobile and was one of the first ever magnet drive air vehicles
and the second was my first attempt at makign something that even resembled a real plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:36:11 magnet drive vehicles period*
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:36:54 yeah but keep in mind that was like 2016
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:40:08 this is one of my older ones as well, you can tell because i only used black + overly bright red/blue back then lol
but it was designed to be extremely small while still being a capable combat vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:41:12 my head is practically bigger than it lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:42:31 yeah its just about as small as you can make something and still have it be able to win a fight
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:42:45 i like using it for more casual ground based pvp servers
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:43:21 the only thing smaller i have is this jetpack-like thing that flies like crap but is still fun
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:44:53 wth is a meta key
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 00:48:54 but yeah my cheat code is to never really build something thats supposed to look like a real life vehicle so no one can ever tell me it doesnt look realistic :)
general 2022-07-09 01:06:32 furries are based
general 2022-07-09 01:08:51 LMAO the cat
