creations-chat 2020-05-02 12:47:31 maybe
creations-chat 2020-05-02 12:49:48 eh that sounds too into it. "Does drone things" or "secretly watches your neighbors at all hours of the night reporting back to chicom spies things that should not be allowed to be seen" I think works better

help 2020-05-24 23:39:11 anyone know how to build a working one bladed heli?
help 2020-05-24 23:39:37 like it doesnt have two big ones
help 2020-05-24 23:39:41 /just one
help 2020-05-24 23:39:49 of course it has the one in the back
help 2020-05-24 23:40:02 but it doesnt have the two in opposite directions
help 2020-05-24 23:40:12 idk im not much of a heli expert
help 2020-05-24 23:40:19 ill send a pic
help 2020-05-24 23:40:42 im trying to make a huey
help 2020-05-24 23:40:54 but the problem is that it always flips over
help 2020-05-24 23:41:09 cause the torque from the big blade
help 2020-05-24 23:41:22 wdym
help 2020-05-24 23:42:03 no like the momentum or something of the blade spinning flips it over
help 2020-05-24 23:42:30 pic is above
help 2020-05-24 23:43:12 ok just a sec
help 2020-05-24 23:43:22 
help 2020-05-24 23:43:33 also i gtg afk for a sec
help 2020-05-24 23:43:41 gotta ***eat dinner***
help 2020-05-24 23:43:48 oh boy
help 2020-05-25 00:16:48 <@!609198621526589450> k im back
help 2020-05-25 00:17:46 i still am not sure wat to do with this huey
help 2020-05-25 00:18:39 can anyone help
help 2020-05-25 00:36:43 i have been doing that for the past 3 hours
help 2020-05-25 00:36:52 and nothing seems to be working
help 2020-05-25 00:37:28 no matter what direction the blades are going, the heli will always find a way to lean and flip sideways
help 2020-05-25 00:37:43 how come
help 2020-05-25 00:38:02 center of mass
help 2020-05-25 00:38:05 ??
help 2020-05-25 00:39:18 well its not like it leans in the same direction every time, if you change the blade rotation direction, it tips over the other way
help 2020-05-25 00:39:43 so do i just reduce the torque or something?
help 2020-05-25 00:41:16 shoot that might interfere with the authenticity of the look
help 2020-05-25 00:41:35 ok
help 2020-05-25 00:41:43 ill try
help 2020-05-25 00:42:35 shoot they really need to make CoM correspond to ballast block values as well
help 2020-05-25 00:43:35 k what do you suggest i do?
help 2020-05-25 00:43:43 this is a problem
help 2020-05-25 00:46:08 
help 2020-05-25 00:46:20 see how it endlessly tips sideways?
help 2020-05-25 00:49:21 <@!299289130964090881>
help 2020-05-25 00:51:28 its almost like the counter rotor is causing it tho
help 2020-05-25 00:51:34 its really weird
help 2020-05-25 00:52:51 I know thats how it works but
help 2020-05-25 00:53:01 The problem is if i use the back rotor to try and counter the rotation of the big blade
help 2020-05-25 00:53:11 then it tips over
help 2020-05-25 00:53:44 you are right, its not centered, but idk how to change that
help 2020-05-25 00:54:01 
help 2020-05-25 00:54:22 but the CoM unfortunately doenst match up to placed ballasts
help 2020-05-25 00:55:14 wdym its too close to the main body
help 2020-05-25 00:55:53 no, cause you got the rotor
help 2020-05-25 00:56:16 bruh idk what to do
help 2020-05-25 00:56:31 uhh wdym
help 2020-05-25 00:56:45 nani
help 2020-05-25 00:57:04 ok
help 2020-05-25 00:58:31 how do i know if its enough, cause the CoM marker doesnt correspond to ballasts
help 2020-05-25 01:01:32 yeah i tried putting ballasts in the front to see if it would stop tipping, it justs weighs down the front, and keeps tipping, just in a nose dive position
help 2020-05-25 01:02:24 
help 2020-05-25 01:03:37 and as always, switching blade direction just makes it tilt in the other direction
help 2020-05-25 01:04:31 reeeeeeeeeeeeee
help 2020-05-25 01:12:52 now i have my doubts that its a problem with my CoM, cause i did this to line it up with my rotor, and it still works just as horribly
help 2020-05-25 01:13:19 also just so you know, thats how many blocks i would need in order to line up my CoM
help 2020-05-25 01:13:28 and i dont have that kind of space
help 2020-05-25 01:14:32 
help 2020-05-25 01:16:22 <@!299289130964090881> im sorry but i think this might just be a lost cause
help 2020-05-25 01:21:06 in the meantime, its alabama choo choo time
help 2020-05-25 01:59:30 yeah ik
help 2020-05-25 02:00:44 its green to give that hillbilly feel
help 2020-05-25 02:01:10 ya know, random parts tacked onto things in lack of better materials and professionalism
help 2020-05-25 13:44:46 i think i found my problem to my huey
help 2020-05-25 13:47:49 but that is pretty hard to solve without a swash plate
help 2020-05-25 13:47:57 so im gonna pull an amature move
help 2020-05-25 13:48:21 and make the whole rotor assembly move in all directions
help 2020-05-25 14:12:53 yep i really cant fix it
help 2020-05-25 14:13:11 i need some serious help from the higher beings
help 2020-05-25 14:14:12 is there a video for "sakura's swashplate"?
help 2020-05-25 14:15:17 sure
help 2020-05-25 14:15:45 off
help 2020-05-25 14:15:48 oof*
help 2020-05-25 14:16:45 im just gonna attempt to make my own, and see how it goes
help 2020-05-25 14:16:49 likely horribly
help 2020-05-25 14:16:53 but oh well
help 2020-05-25 14:39:40 ok nevermind my heli is too compact for a swashplate
help 2020-05-25 14:39:57 oh dear rickje please make a swashplate
help 2020-05-25 15:55:03 im not much of a ship guy but id say make your own scale
help 2020-05-25 16:01:46 idk thats what im trying to make
help 2020-05-25 16:01:51 and figure out
help 2020-05-25 17:21:40 yes but i deleted it
help 2020-05-25 20:57:13 anyone know how to stabilize a coaxial helicopter?
help 2020-05-25 20:57:24 cause mine uncontrollably wobbles
help 2020-05-25 20:58:28 yes
help 2020-05-25 20:59:12 nope
help 2020-05-25 20:59:14 wings
help 2020-05-25 20:59:58 as in the motors that control lift?
help 2020-05-25 21:00:04 or the rotoation motors
help 2020-05-25 21:00:37 which motors
help 2020-05-25 21:00:46 the motors that tilt the blades?
help 2020-05-25 21:01:49 in that case, doesnt that mean that one of theset of blades is producing lift, and the other is making drag?
help 2020-05-25 21:02:09 prop blades are no different really
help 2020-05-25 21:02:17 they are just tilted
help 2020-05-25 21:03:03 i know cause the motors go in two different directions, you have to have the props turned opposite to both create lift
help 2020-05-25 21:04:35 is this what you want me to do
help 2020-05-25 21:06:50 for some reason though my helicopter uncontrollable creates a ton of roll and yaw back and forth
help 2020-05-25 21:06:59 its like its swining
help 2020-05-25 21:07:02 swinging*
help 2020-05-25 21:07:09 and not flying straight
help 2020-05-25 21:09:34 also is there a way to convert block weight to ballast weight?
help 2020-05-25 21:10:08 is there a formula
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:10:53 is there a way to convert block weight to ballast weight?
creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:16:47 oki doki

creations-chat 2020-05-25 21:17:19 blocks*
help 2020-05-25 21:51:23 ok
help 2020-05-25 21:51:35 is the problem the spinning or the wings themselves?
help 2020-05-25 21:52:54 side props as in rear rotors?
help 2020-05-25 22:00:00 yeah i tried that and it still endlessly swings

the-dump 2020-06-02 23:43:02 this video is very scary
the-dump 2020-06-02 23:43:06 watch at your own risk
the-dump 2020-06-08 15:58:16 ngl this sign is pretty racist
the-dump 2020-06-08 16:10:46 tbh, saying all lives dont matter until black lives matter, is either saying that all lives dont include black lives, or that black lives are more special, so they come first, there fore you have the different treatment of blacks than everyone else, which by definition, is racist

creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:44:58 well you were telling me mine looks like shit compared to yours, and posted a picture that I cant even make out anything thats in it other than the basic shape so your argument is kinda stupid. also I originally had the pilot wheels proportioned correctly for the train I was going after, but I couldnt get it to function correctly (around turns because the wheels were too far apart and it would get stuck) thus why I moved the rear pilot wheel in front of hte pistons. so its not going to be completely accurate as im still trying to make it functional
creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:47:59 
creations-chat 2021-09-07 19:51:00 ok cool? im just saying im not mad cause I got downvotes or something, im saying yall are full of yourselves and need to learn to calm down.

the-dump 2021-12-13 02:09:53 true
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:10:37 yeah but the server needs cleansing too
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:11:55 how bout you just leave
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:11:57 you can leave
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:02 its just up to you to make that choice
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:11 you gotta denounce that lifestyle
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:18 and turn your life completely around
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:24 but if you want to you can do it
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:57 first step: change your pfp to something NOT furry related
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:14:24 or become normal
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:15:55 we dont care furry
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:16:19 all your furry discord servers are a waste of server space
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:16:54 go be an over sensitive animal toucher somewhere else
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:17:12 then what is this furry community you speak of
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:17:33 stereotypes are based in truth <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:18:28 well then theres no point in you being a furry
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:18:49 stop lying to yourself about how you are expressing your true self and just be normal
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:19:20 sincerely I hope that this is a phase and you grow out of it

the-dump 2021-12-13 02:22:30 I love bejing tiananmen!
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:39:18 are we talking about building 80%ers I want in on this convo
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:39:30 that shits fun
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:41:40 <@!479305807674998804> I will say be careful where you talk abou your 80% guns because despite not needing a federal background check I think they are "technically" illegal to build as a minor probably under the AWB
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:42:11 but I cant tell you that I havent done it myself either <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:45:28 also btw I hope thats not your name in the middle
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:49:22 got it
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:54:18 quick tip: lift until it hurts, and I mean like you have trouble walking around and picking things up and walking up stairs hurts, and then load up on protein and carbs
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:54:24 works for me
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:56:52 my standard is that if you can walk up the stairs after leg day then you aint worked hard enough
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:56:57 same with chest and arms
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:57:11 if you can raise your arms without screaming pain in your arms and chest you aint worked hard enough
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:57:45 it also helps if you work out with other people cause sometimes being around others helps to push you to do more than you are usually comfortable with
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:58:04 its fun being in a weight room with your friends cause you compete to do better than them
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:58:12 and if you cant do better than them you make it your goal to
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:59:02 nice nice
the-dump 2021-12-14 02:59:22 im not too much of a runner I just lift heavy objects and eat chicken to put it simple
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:00:42 it really does
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:01:45 yeah
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:03:13 my school offers it as well
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:03:21 but I used to work out in my basement
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:03:36 it was a rusty ass chernobyl setup
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:03:54 im glad I can use the school weights now they are so nice
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:04:44 unfortunately yes
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:05:10 very much so
the-dump 2021-12-14 03:05:36 do you do super sets when you lift?

the-dump 2022-01-13 01:03:11 and?<:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:03:52 one is bigger and stinkier and people dont form emotional connections to very much
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:04:18 the other is literally used worldwide to be a companion
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:04:27 depends what kind of farmer
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:04:53 if you are a cattle raiser then idk if you are gonna connect to the cattle you are legit raising to get slaughtered
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:05:46 you legit cant have a service cow
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:05:49 not practical
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:05:57 you can have service dogs
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:06:12 and dogs can be trained to do various complex things
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:06:29 dogs have more practical purpose than just chinese take out
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:06:34 I wouldnt doubt it

the-dump 2022-01-13 01:09:55 but its not practical
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:10:03 because most doors arent designed to fit cows
the-dump 2022-01-13 01:10:16 hypothetically for this kind of scenario doesnt work in the real world

the-dump 2022-01-15 01:40:28 So that bmx peg presses up against the rear wheel
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:40:47 It's not powerful but once you get it going I think itl do alright
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:41:49 Chains are actually a lot more annoying to deal with than you'd think
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:43:02 First they are very greasy, very dirty, hard to link and unlink, and they have to be corresponding chain sizes to the correct size gear
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:43:41 A chain drive would be more effective if done right, but that means I would actually have to put in work
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:43:59 A fucking hate chains for that reason
the-dump 2022-01-15 01:44:06 A real pain in the ass

the-dump 2022-01-17 02:55:23 because I can come up with an even more degenerate statement in response
the-dump 2022-01-17 16:59:20 dont care + didnt ask + im gonna keep being racist
the-dump 2022-01-17 16:59:38 infact im gonna be even more racist to compensate for the fact that it is anti racism day

the-dump 2022-01-17 18:16:51 also building guns out of construction materials arent illegal, but theres more specifics involved that can make it illegal
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:17:58 building homemade firearms arent illegal
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:18:34 making a firearm thats fully automatic, open bolt, or being a minor tho while making it is technically illegal
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:18:59 well yeah but who tf is gonna do that
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:19:19 that requires a background check
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:19:47 not illegal
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:20:08 guns arent fucking illegal to build dumbass
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:20:26 but building is more fun
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:20:50 aluminum and iron oxide<:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:22:26 if yall really want to build a gun without a background check in the most legal way possible, do an 80% lower build and then buy an upper parts kit and have it shipped to your house, put the two and two together and you have a gun. Only problem is they are very difficult if you have never done them before, and you have to have certain expensive tools to do it correctly. Mods this is 100% legal btw
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:23:00 but considering that not many people have these tools unless you work a trade, its not likely that many people get their hands on guns this way
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:24:00 not as good as a metal reciever but yes these can work
the-dump 2022-01-17 18:25:17 this has been your daily dose of firearm shit with your friendly neighborhood redneck

the-dump 2022-01-19 02:04:22 I salute you
the-dump 2022-01-19 02:35:40 very much so
the-dump 2022-01-19 02:37:57 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/929796168018460712/933174042565967943/video0_7_2.mp4
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:09:04 Or yk, people are actually getting hurt from an experimental vaccine that was made in record time and the companies that made it decided there was too much legal risk so they literally got immunity from legal liability, but yk those are just crazy conspiracies
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:11:21 Well the CDC does a lot of things that make 0 sense
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:13:18 Including but not limited to accidentally admitting masks do nothing, reducing quarantine time from 10 days to 5 days, or covering up and then admitting things we knew all along like most people dead from covid had 4 or more comorbitities
the-dump 2022-01-19 17:14:04 Anyways I gotta go drive somewhere, I'll check the race war I just started when I get home
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:18:49 well people get flu vaccines so they dont actually get the flu. If we are following the concept of a traditional vaccine then covid vaccines arent effective as many if not most people who get the vaccine still get covid, and many still get hospitalized from it
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:23:38 actually this is exactly how it works. If someone has a condition that prevents them from naturally helping them survive, their death would be in part due to said condition. If that person with a broken leg had a normal functioning leg, chances are he would have been able to run form the car. Same with covid, people with immune system issues essentially have their natural way of fighting illnesses suppressed and although covid is the cause of death, their comorbidity plays a very hefty role in making their death easier as they cant fight it
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:24:31 well i was gonna argue both, jsut I left for like an hour so I got to get to the basic points
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:24:38 gotta catch up on the race war
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:25:36 ***kill the cripples***
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:25:48 alright tho in all honesty let me answer your question
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:26:56 I personally do not believe that the vaccine is safe nor effective, in my opinion it would be hurting them and probably pushing them into the metaphorical car to be giving them the vaccine
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:27:30 I have a lot of anacdotal shit to back my claims up but idk if you want to hear that, im tired tho and im too lazy to pull up random statistics out of my ass right now
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:28:23 actually, if the vulnerable want to take the precaution of locking down I am fine with that. It is their risk to take
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:28:48 kinda like how you stay home from school and eat chicken noodle soup when you get sick, physical isolation of unhealthy people can infact work
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:29:44 you cant, and so thats why there are also other remedies to boost your health and immune system other than getting vaccinated
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:30:24 first off, one of the comorbidities many people have is being morbidly obese. If you keep your body in relatively good shape you are already better off
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:30:43 second is eating healthy and getting plenty of vitamins
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:10 well im answering your question about letting the metaphorical amputee get hit by the metaphorical car
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:36 essentially I believe there are other ways to help the metaphorical amputee out of the way
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:31:48 thats already step one, live a healthier life style
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:32:11 they dont, and they can make their own conscious decision to improve themselves
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:34:17 also true, however even most older people that get plenty of vitamins and live healthier and non sedentary lives are at greater possibility of surviving covid. It might hit them like a really bad cold but its more likely they will make it if they live healthier
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:34:39 a big portion of people dying from covid simply arent healthy, ***cough cough new york people***
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:35:42 im willing to just keep it to a nice peaceful back and forth of whether or not the vaccines are safe and effective
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:39:16 there might have been obnoxious mean tweets but at least the gas prices were below 2 fucking dollars
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:39:31 here the prices are above 3.50
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:39:43 under trump it was under 1.50

the-dump 2022-01-19 18:43:14 I wish but my computer cant run it
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:43:20 thats why I play boblos
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:44:23 it also takes over two days on my computer to download
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:45:04 uh oh
the-dump 2022-01-19 18:45:37 alright ping me with something when you are all caught up and we shall continue our remarkable convo
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:05:59 If people truly want to take the vaccine and full heartedly believe it is good and effective, it is up to them. That is a risk they are willing to take, along with the risk of simply being around other people. I still believe that it is also up to them to take natural precautions of strengthening their immune system (exercise, staying in a healthy weight range, getting vitamins and minerals daily, certain medicines which have been largely proven effective in mitigating the effects of covid such as HCQ or ivermectin). If they do not want to keep their bodies healthy, that is also their personal choice and eventually probably their problem. They can take the vaccine but if they suffer any effects due to it, they are not able to sue as the medical companies applied for liability protections against people suing due to adverse reactions. They are also essentially giving their bodies to be used in trial as we do not actually know all the long term effects of these more recent vaccines, and what they can do to your body 10, 20, 30, 40 years down the line. I am personally healthy, along with most of my family so we are able to treat it like the cold. However, there are many members of our family who are not vaccinated, and immune compromised or have weakened immune systems due to age, they have all had covid and either didn't feel the effects of it, or had minor cases of it. I also happen to know more people personally who have developed immune system conditions or other medical problems immediately after taking the vaccine than I know who have died of covid. Now the last two things I said were purely anecdotal so take them for what you will, however they are also largely the reason that I personally do not trust these vaccines. But at the end of the day, everyone has risks they must be willing to take, and it is your own medical decision as to if you think the vaccine is right for you.
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:07:00 its up to people if they want to believe the vaccine is good or not, thats their risk. Also, live healthier and get some vitamins daily and you probably will have a better chance not dying
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:07:24 lol I mentioned the forbidden horsepaste
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:07:40 ikik im a crazed conspiracy theorist
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:11:32 agreed
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:18:11 I also dont think that people should get persuaded to get a vaccine they might regret later on down the line. But once again at the end of the day it is purely up to you which risk you want to run, and I think people should hear both sides because there is a mainstream narrative and then one that is largely shut down and passed off as misinformation. I will thank you immensely that this didn't end up as a giant shouting match where everything got out of hand, so we shall agree to disagree and I wish you good luck and good health my good chap, now lets get back to professional shitposting gents
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:19:07 well im hoping my last post kinda ends it so we can get back to shitposting and eating cereal
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:19:24 yeah this is one of the few arguments where both parties were civilized
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:24:40 I aint gonna try to start another giant wall of text argument but essentially thats your choice to make. personally I havent caught covid nor had anything with severe symptoms at all despite being around lots of people everyday for the last 5-6 months and I havent gotten the vaccine, so for now I trust my immune system. But do what you think is best for you
the-dump 2022-01-19 19:26:36 thats understandable. I hope you and your family stay healthy no matter what road you guys go down
