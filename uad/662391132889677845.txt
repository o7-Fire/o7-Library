plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:27:13 It was supposed to be a PTAK 30
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:27:17 But i changed the layout
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:27:27 And modified it a bit
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:28:24 
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:29:09 I had to modify it because somehow it doesnt work like in real life
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:29:15 For stability
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:32:04 I'll have to improve it, i already know

plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:34:20 I had to make two sets because they were moving too slow
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:34:28 So i had to add more power
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:34:40 Because if not it wouldn't even move up
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:35:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:35:53 But i had to make a compact design
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:36:20 Take a look, there's almost no space left
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 16:38:00 Hmm
