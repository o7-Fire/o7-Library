general 2023-06-13 17:47:56 dumb but k
general 2023-06-13 17:48:23 i never knew there was one that could copy someone's build ðŸ’€ imagine spawning ur best build and someone copies it ðŸ˜‚
general 2023-06-13 17:48:33 in like 5 seconds
general 2023-06-13 17:48:48 i play in public servers
general 2023-06-13 17:49:03 not common but im pretty sure theyre paid?
general 2023-06-13 17:49:52 there is autobuild where people give u their builds to copy (not really copying but copying) but there is one like where you insta copy someone's build in the server
general 2023-06-13 17:51:34 <@690931622345834527> im sure ur talking about the ones where people build the stuff with autobuid
general 2023-06-13 17:51:52 those are free
general 2023-06-13 17:52:01 but the insta copy ones are supposed to be paid
general 2023-06-13 17:52:03 i think
general 2023-06-13 17:52:26 i mean why would someone give an insta copy behemoth for free?
