plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:47:33 are there any blocks with no weight?
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:48:23 cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-28 10:48:25 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 15:38:30 suspensions with 0 stiffness are weird
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 15:39:01 they remove almost all friction
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 15:39:05 somehow
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 16:24:20 ill show you
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 16:24:30 get in call so i can screenshare
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 17:02:22 is there any way to prevent blocks from fusing when using suspensions?
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 17:10:23 could someone help me?
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 17:13:02 oh ok
help 2020-06-06 17:23:42 is there any way to prevent block fusing when using suspensions?
help 2020-06-06 17:25:10 i have this thingy that can accelerate exponentially by using 0 stiffness and 0 damping suspensions but after a while it just fuses together
plane-crazy 2020-06-06 17:27:54 imagine being a good builder
