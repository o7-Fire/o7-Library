general 2021-04-24 22:16:25 Well, the gameâ€™s physics are somewhat back to what they were before

creations-chat 2021-06-16 19:54:54 but they   f o l d
creations-chat 2021-06-16 21:40:47 sorry i accidentally clicked the textbox. also he knows he did because he's my friend
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:12:44 I donâ€™t really need them, I just have them because I like seeing people get flung
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:15:36 I literally have a screen recording of it happening
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:17:48 No, in one of your tanks. Also, the recordingâ€™s too big, but Iâ€™ll send screenshots
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:21:34 It was a lot smaller, and it didn't have those sawblades at the time
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:25:15 I rarely used my cutters, I used my other weapons, too. Also, I rarely flew, and I was on the ground most of the time, due to how horribly balanced it was when it was in flight
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:31:55 I canâ€™t find the video for some reason, but I did take these 2 screenshots from when it happened
creations-chat 2021-06-16 22:34:06 Reason for taking the screenshots with my phone: It lags like hell whenever Iâ€™m screen-recording
Also, it wasnâ€™t as easy to control at the time. And Iâ€™m not gonna lie, he put up a pretty good fight
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:00:57 I didnâ€™t know about win+shift+s at the time, so i used another software, which I forgot the name of. The reason for this is because when it takes screenshots, it gives me a bunch of options of what to do, so I have to manually click it with my cursor. This way, I could control my build with one hand while I take a picture with the other. Also <@!516436875494293524>, it wasnâ€™t very stable at the time. Thatâ€™s why I modified it into a giant flying stick.
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:03:08 Yep, thatâ€™s right
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:05:10 No, I was helping my dad move a bunch of shit around upstairs. We have a guy over here right now because weâ€™re having our kitchen floors redone.
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:10:18 Pretty good. Love the detail
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:14:39 I got some honest feedback about my build, and Iâ€™ve accepted it
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:31:55 To be honest, that white outlining on the wings and stuff doesnâ€™t look too good
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:39:17 You clearly didnâ€™t see what I typed after that
Also <@!854802119100989470>, hereâ€™s the RBG for the color of the Oshkosh in that picture

186,176,150
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:52:01 Well, if itâ€™s useful information, and gives you an idea of what to type afterwards, then itâ€™s probably worth your time. Also, Iâ€™m not glorifying it. I just tried to give every bit of detail I could about it.
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:54:03 Dammit, Iâ€™m sorry, I forgot that you werenâ€™t the one who made fun of the screenshots
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:41:11 You can do something to cover it up, like put guns in front of the motors
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:43:15 Itâ€™s not entirely false. there was a Stuka variant with 37mm guns on that same area, except they were on the bottom of the wings.
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:46:26 Yeah, discord has an embed fail problem atm.
Also <@!340543153922768906>, which one?
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:48:35 Nevermind, I found it
creations-chat 2021-06-17 03:44:36 this post turns 2 years old today
creations-chat 2021-06-17 03:51:04 nevermind, i just found one that looks like that
creations-chat 2021-06-17 03:55:30 no problem! but there's still something you can fix. it looks like the speakers would be a little more towards the front. if you want, you can motor-lock ladders over them for even more detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-17 04:30:08 show us a screenshot of it in your base in build mode
creations-chat 2021-06-17 08:26:26 He said that because it was his opinion. Your migâ€™s wings are far more accurate

Millennium Falcon?
creations-chat 2021-06-26 23:39:17 I know, I was kidding
creations-chat 2021-06-27 12:39:48 This looks great, but the only thing Iâ€™d criticize is the colors. They look a little too bright.
