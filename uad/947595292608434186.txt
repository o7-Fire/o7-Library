general 2022-12-31 20:38:52 Then rick was born in north korea
general 2022-12-31 20:39:37 mech didn't die, robloxian is just a dictator
general 2022-12-31 20:40:19 rick and robloxian are discord dictators, now ban me for my opinion on a person <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-31 20:41:28 bro if you are getting bombed rn and in a basement why do you still have access to the www and discord?
general 2022-12-31 20:41:57 hope the bombings stops soon
general 2022-12-31 20:42:33 you are somewhere between dnipro and donetsk right?

general 2022-12-31 20:43:34 good luck
general 2022-12-31 22:12:08 I am suspected to be an amogus specie
general 2022-12-31 22:12:28 we type with our head
general 2022-12-31 22:12:35 we don't need inferior hands
general 2022-12-31 22:13:06 because we can also do everything that hands can by using our brain
general 2022-12-31 22:13:22 that's it
general 2022-12-31 22:13:27 we summon hands
general 2022-12-31 22:13:33 but we don't have them actually

general 2022-12-31 22:14:52 thanks rick for being a dictator
general 2022-12-31 22:15:16 damn you gave me nostalgia
general 2022-12-31 22:15:47 so how do we get image perms in this ?
general 2022-12-31 22:16:01 i used to play it
general 2022-12-31 22:16:22 then i quit due to glitched tracks
general 2022-12-31 22:16:30 (the controls were awful)
general 2022-12-31 22:16:36 and wt is better
general 2022-12-31 22:20:04 ban
general 2022-12-31 22:20:31 Hello, can you please tell me, do furries still exist in 2023?
general 2022-12-31 22:21:13 **wants to send some war combat footage but has no image perms**
general 2022-12-31 22:21:41 Thanks you too!
general 2022-12-31 22:23:06 yeah, that's a backroom frontline footage as i like to call it
general 2022-12-31 22:23:24 not that cool actually
general 2022-12-31 22:24:54 i used to, but i'm not anymore, i never seen a drone myself, i never seen anything, but i listened to witnesses, and i can roughly understand them, well of course not completely, because i haven't seen it myself
general 2022-12-31 22:25:12 oh no
general 2022-12-31 22:25:15 a tryhard mf
general 2022-12-31 22:25:18 bye chat
general 2022-12-31 22:37:35 You are one of those mfs who spams "ok and" and wait for an answer to roast even more
general 2022-12-31 22:38:11 Who cares
general 2022-12-31 22:38:39 Where and who? Ukrainians?
general 2022-12-31 22:38:54 Ok
general 2022-12-31 22:39:32 Change it to discord argument since it happens everywhere
general 2022-12-31 22:39:57 Business for NATO yeah
general 2022-12-31 22:41:01 Ok so what do you want to say?
general 2022-12-31 22:41:34 : ü§ì
general 2022-12-31 22:42:33 Afghanistan is a civil war
general 2022-12-31 22:45:36 You can't compare what happened in Iraq to what is happening in Ukraine much, in Iraq the US directly destroyed all the defences and directly captured the city of Iraq(explained in a nutshell) while in Ukraine the Russians are shitting and have no idea what they doing so they start killing and playing with the civilians (to death)
general 2022-12-31 22:47:12 No, in 2014 it was a civil war, still not really deadly, 2014-2022 it was kind of a civil war, but i can't really explain it
general 2022-12-31 22:47:53 Let me guess, you are Russian
general 2022-12-31 22:48:24 Climate change üíÄ
general 2022-12-31 22:48:34 Nvm
general 2022-12-31 22:49:30 Because Russians say "stop being political" when someone speaks about the war then proceeds to spam propaganda everywhere
general 2022-12-31 22:50:11 Warn me for political if you are gay
general 2022-12-31 22:50:49 What is a Russian?
general 2022-12-31 22:51:27 What are you?
general 2022-12-31 22:52:03 Stupid jokes i know
general 2022-12-31 22:53:06 I drink pepsi, coke sucks
general 2022-12-31 22:53:51 What?
general 2022-12-31 22:54:21 I don't think harrier pilots have the time to drink pepsi while landing a harrier
general 2022-12-31 22:54:55 You're right
general 2022-12-31 22:55:17 I don't understand
general 2022-12-31 22:56:11 How do I get image perms?
general 2022-12-31 22:57:05 Depends on how many messages you have sent right?
general 2022-12-31 22:58:06 If it depends on how good are ur builds then there is no way you can prove that when u don't have image perms except if you have the right to dm the mods
general 2022-12-31 22:58:49 You have one mere minute
general 2022-12-31 23:04:04 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE (sry I was celebrating bc i have a life)
general 2023-01-04 11:40:09 What's the best setting for the drag and speed in the hover in hover drives?

general 2023-01-04 12:10:39 alright thank you
general 2023-01-06 16:12:09 motorlock 2 wings, use angle lock feature, you can make the first pairs of wings 0.5 blocks upper from the second pair of wings, they should intersect in the end. the problem is how you will make the edges though...
general 2023-01-06 16:12:33 zzzzbrhjjhe
general 2023-01-06 16:13:40 oh bruh i forgot i don't have the godamn image perms

the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:16 the tech tree sucks
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:26 but who cares when you can enjoy pvp
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:26:54 o yeah i forgot skill issue and the fact that the game requires superpowers to be played perfectly
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:27:11 but arcade gamemodes exists anyway
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:28:59 anyway
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:29:45 at least it has more goals than suffering in pl*ne crazy or m*chanica
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:30:18 and getting called a "noob " for every single build you do

the-dump 2023-01-06 16:31:34 this reminds me of "if you bother learning some war thunder skills i think that would change"
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:32:35 then explain me how plane crazy is a healthy addiction
the-dump 2023-01-06 16:32:44 or what is even a "healthy addiction"
