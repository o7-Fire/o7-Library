general 2022-12-15 20:50:12 My build got exactly copied by someone with a script or something, he was dutch so i couldnt understand him very well
 I haven't played this game in a while so he had to of done it a while ago,  and so i logged on today and he had it
general 2022-12-15 20:50:14 It was the exact same thing
general 2022-12-15 20:50:20 There was unnecessary camreas placed
general 2022-12-15 20:50:24 That i forgot to take away
general 2022-12-15 20:50:27 And randomly painted blocks
general 2022-12-15 20:50:30 I forgot to unpaint
general 2022-12-15 20:50:34 I have a video
general 2022-12-15 20:50:40 It didnt motorlock though
general 2022-12-15 20:50:46 Because his script iddnt work for htat
general 2022-12-15 20:50:56 And the script placed a few random blocks in replacement of others
general 2022-12-15 20:51:02 Like used half wedge downs for half blocks
general 2022-12-15 20:51:06 Yea
general 2022-12-15 20:51:08 Still makes me kinda mad
general 2022-12-15 20:51:12 He left after a while of denying it
general 2022-12-15 20:51:22 Yea
general 2022-12-15 20:51:28 It was just crazy to me
general 2022-12-15 20:51:31 I hadnt been on in a while
general 2022-12-15 20:51:37 So what are the chances of me finding him
general 2022-12-15 20:51:42 Like being in the same server
general 2022-12-15 20:51:53 He was on mobile or something cause the build took like half na hour to load
general 2022-12-15 20:52:35 yea
general 2022-12-15 20:52:51 I have a video of his build and mine
general 2022-12-15 20:53:03 I pointed out the things that were exact copies that he couldnt of just had a coincidence with
general 2022-12-15 20:53:14 Alr
