general 2023-02-04 03:10:24 );
general 2023-02-04 03:10:39 Pls
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 03:11:55 Why isn't there an undo button in pc?
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 03:13:07 Yo how do people make jets that can immediately go from hover mode to like mach 10
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 03:15:04 Wow, I've seen some crazy creation with things like darthstar that just shift in milliseconds
general 2023-02-04 03:19:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 03:20:50 Can you add thrust vectoring to jets in pc? I've never seen someone do it
help 2023-02-04 03:22:26 How do you get engineer ranks and such? Like I get that you have to be lvl 3 and submit an image, but when you submit a build what happens after that?
bot-central 2023-02-04 05:22:41 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:23:42 yo how do you do thrust vectoring dude Ive been trying to figure this out for so long
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:28:55 yeah, I wanna make it for looks and to help with manueverability but I might just give up
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:29:56 does engines pointing in different direction even affect the jet?
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 06:59:03 Oh my god

the-dump 2023-02-04 20:25:28 Interesting
creations-chat 2023-02-04 20:31:51 Because it is, I made it with the tutorial then added on to it because I know nothing about balancing out vertical lift offs, like I added hover thrusters and a bomb bay + I'm making it so the engine turns into stovl mode
creations-chat 2023-02-04 20:33:57 Damn, the evidence is gone
I have planes I can show with no tutorial I geussðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-02-04 20:37:06 Alot of them are, f35 f22 f16 f14
The rest are super cringe builds
And I have a su-57 that isn't a tutorial I just don't know what category it would be in
creations-chat 2023-02-04 20:40:19 No just basic, I'm not at home rn chily... or actually I can get it off mobile but I can't fly it
