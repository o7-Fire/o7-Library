plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:09:11 your normals are flipped
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:09:19 no need for a solidify
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:09:39 that just doubles the face count which already seems very high
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:10:13 also use smooth shading please :)
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:12:44 it does though
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:12:58 ive tried and smooth shading works in roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:13:37 i still do like the concept though
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:16:59 i think it might be used for lag boxes
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:17:14 well theres probably laggier blocks

plane-crazy 2020-12-01 04:13:17 so its ~630000/3 = 210000
creations-chat 2020-12-01 04:18:21 "3K blocks so far... already lagging my OC’d 2080Ti"
my bet's on cpu limitation, or you just seem to have 4k monitor or something
