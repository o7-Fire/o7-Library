plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:23:39 I play plan crazy on mobile and flying is easy once you get the hang of it
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:25:00 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 22:32:45 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 13:29:05 It would be a lot better if you could save the buttons instead of having to reset them everytime I play the game (mobile problems)
general 2020-04-09 22:46:23 I made a tomahawk missile and build ya sub around it I’m deadly hidden under the seas for mobile. Only downside is having to rearrange the buttons
general 2020-04-09 22:46:51 <@!424656494949040129> that’s sounds really dope
bug-reports 2020-04-09 22:53:03 Not sure if they care about mobile player but please fix the building bug and can you add something so mobile players don’t have to keep rearranging the buttons after leaving the game?
bug-reports 2020-04-09 22:53:52 I like the way it’s arranged
bug-reports 2020-04-12 03:01:21 I’m a mobile player so graphics should be fine NOPE can’t even load my sub without crashing in a PVP surver
general 2020-04-16 00:38:33 <@238017332872478720> what PC you using?
general 2020-04-16 00:38:49 To play roblox
general 2020-04-16 00:38:55 I been playing on my phone
general 2020-04-16 00:39:04 What type?
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:53:14 Bruh I play on mobile and every time I launch I get sent to an angle camera view
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 03:53:21 Can I turn that crap off?

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 20:41:58 Any mobile players?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 20:53:48 Mobile is hard as fork building is hard don’t judge me
bug-reports 2020-05-01 05:40:03 Don’t use a parachute when flying at high speeds

bot-central 2020-06-08 17:32:13 ?whois
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:26:04 has anyone thought about cannons ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:26:09 like battleship cannons
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:26:26 yup
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:26:49 soo Like we have guns,rockets,and boom cannon
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:26:58 I think it would be fun
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:28:07 Your confusing me
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:29:57 the cannon would allow you to fire small balls and explode on impact
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:30:30 how it would work is you can change it so if can be like an actual mortar shell
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:33:05 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:33:35 it’s hard to explain
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:33:42 like bullet drop
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:34:23 I think cannons should be a thing in the future
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:38:55 I see what your saying
