plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:50:52 REEEEEE
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:50:54 was good homies
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:02 sometimes this game makes me mad :/
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:07 how
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:12 ugh
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:18 why is making a full auto mech hard ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:24 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:30 I got the first prototype to work
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:51:37 but not the new more compact version
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:11 dang
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:12 noice
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:19 why would you lock a motor 2 tho ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:32 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:40 what's your fastest plane that actually works?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:49 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:52:53 like speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:00 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:02 noice
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:14 I got a plane that goes 20k spm
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:19 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:27 what is the measurement in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:31 studs per min right?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:33 or no
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:36 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:40 k
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:46 I got 20k studs per sec once
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:53:48 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:16 so mine went like mach 10 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:21 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:21 well
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:23 it was
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:32 mach 14
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:33 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:45 I love conveyer engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:53 fuck off biotch
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:54:54 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:55:58 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:56:32 see if you can figure out how this works lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:56:52 FULL auto mech leg
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:56:56 ima make it better tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:57:15 rn it has 2 motors with a camshaft each controlling one part of the leg
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:57:48 ima make it so that it's one motor tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:57:57 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:58:03 I've only seen like 1 more
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:58:07 and it didn't work that well
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:58:15 that's why I dedicated myself to making one
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:58:16 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:59:31 I made a drift racer that transforms into a 4x4 offroader
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:59:41 
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 01:59:51 it doesn't look like much of a change, but it does a lot
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:00:36 haven't built a body for it tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:00:57 who knew pistons are great suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:01:40 noice
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:01:48 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:01:52 I have an apache
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:01:58 needs some adjusting tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:02:07 I made it mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:02:49 using motor 2's changing the pitch on the blades
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:02:55 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:03:12 like actually tho ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:04:11 like how u do hat m8 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:06:21 pls explain ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:06:24 *dat
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:07:28 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:07:29 no...
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:07:31 maybe?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:07:33 no...
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:07:51 I wonder...
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:09 well yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:10 but also
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:17 I was thinkin about something else
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:31 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:36 ooo
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:08:41 anti copy blacklist
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:10:49 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:10:50 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:11:43 here's a project I've been working on
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:12:04 does nobody know what this is
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:12:13 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:12:52 but how ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:16:00 I wanted to make it as real as possible so I added 3650 torque XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:16:11 I got a b2 I've been working on
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:17:32 not done tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:17:48 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:17:56 the steering doesn't rly work yet
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:18:18 either
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:18:22 it doesn't steer
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:18:49 it just starts spinning if I try to turn too much and if not enough it does nothing at all
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:18:57 k
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:19:05 big brain
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:19:25 DANG
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:38:38 my mach 14 plane lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:01 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:04 ik
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:09 it looks a bit better an top
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:15 it works rly well tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:49 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:40:54 it can turn on a dime
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:58:54 does anyone have a solution to having giant wheels not fling without having to add extra motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:58:56 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:00 it works well on larger vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:02 but not on small one
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:04 *ones
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:12 this is the most compact one I can make
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:19 o
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:42 I think that makes the magnet like permanently attached to something?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 02:59:56 do you guys have a better solution
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:00:49 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:02:41 oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:02:52 oof.
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:07:35 wht u tryna make?
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:08:07 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 03:08:26 oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:37:11 nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:38:54 yo
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:39:04 there is an admin in my server
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:39:10 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:39:10 and this dude tryna report him for hacking
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:39:44 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:39:48 u kaz?
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:01 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:04 ur not
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:05 my bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:06 lool
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:08 *lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:40:45 lol nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:42:21 oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:48:53 The moment I finally realized you can use magnets to make motors spin at like 1 mil speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 06:51:59 ngl it actually works rly well to make compact counter rotating fans if you do it right
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:03:44 guys
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:05 can u see if u can build a space ship from the game star conflict
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:06 that works
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:10 is so hard
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:19 bc u gotta make it have basically 0 friction
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:24 which is impossible
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:04:38 so u gotta compensate with thrust
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:06:57 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:07 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:08 what
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:37 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:40 star conflict
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:41 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:44 what ship should I give u
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:04 should I give u a good ship or a cool looking one?
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:19 k
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:39 this is arguably the best frigate
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:40 
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:42 
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:52 however
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:56 kinda ugly ngl :/
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:01 what ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:15 if u want something cool
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:16 um
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:41 
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:44 prob this one
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:09:53 I was gonna choose something else
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:02 but I figured this would be easier to make in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:13 bc u can basically make it out of wing panels for the edges
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:19 and everything else half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:23 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:30 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:31 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:38 I'm playin mc rn
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:47 well

plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:11:05 k
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:11:20 HOLY CRAP
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:11:26 THIS RLCRAFT WORLD THO
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:11:38 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:11:38 there are like 4 rare structures each like 10 blocks away from spawn
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:05 ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:10 o
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:11 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:14 I mean like buildings
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:17 like a castle
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:18 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:23 there is a dungeon
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:25 in the sky
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:32 and a floating castle in the sky
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:38 and a floating castle on the wawter
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:40 *water
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:48 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:48 and a sea serpent
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:56 ofc
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:12:58 ik
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:13:02 I think it be gone tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:13:11 ima build to the water castle just in case tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:13:27 right
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:13:29 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:14:50 noice
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:15:05 I made a b-2 bomber in alpha
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:15:12 it was aight.
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:15:17 my new one is way better tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:21:10 oof
general 2020-12-23 04:03:28 ummmm
general 2020-12-23 04:03:33 I was makin a swashplate
general 2020-12-23 04:03:35 and uhhh
general 2020-12-23 04:03:39 just realized something
general 2020-12-23 04:04:08 look at the shape of this ;-;
general 2020-12-23 04:04:14 well then.
general 2020-12-23 04:04:26 I swear this was not on purpose XD
general 2020-12-23 04:04:36 yes it does
general 2020-12-23 04:04:40 just not yet
general 2020-12-23 04:04:45 it's a swashplate
general 2020-12-23 04:04:50 I just started making it
general 2020-12-23 04:05:01 it's not done
general 2020-12-23 04:05:05 ;-;
general 2020-12-23 04:05:22 ;-;
general 2020-12-23 04:05:32 I started like 30 seconds ago ;-;
general 2020-12-23 04:06:12 14
general 2020-12-23 04:06:13 almost 15

general 2020-12-23 04:06:20 why
general 2020-12-23 04:06:36 I would change my sure
general 2020-12-23 04:06:39 but I need robux

bot-central 2021-04-01 15:18:56 -pccmc
bot-central 2021-04-01 15:19:03 ;-;
bot-central 2021-04-01 15:19:07 How
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:09:07 ok
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:14:27 ;-; I was telling the dude what the symbol was. I'm honestly surprised that's considered a bad word. also, lol
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:16:37 bruh how did so many ppl see it I deleted it like 2 seconds after I posted it XD
creations-chat 2021-06-09 06:18:38 can we continue these conversations in another channel that doesn't have a 2 min cooldown XD
bug-reports 2021-06-09 06:23:58 this has been happening to me for a really long time, I just forgot to report it. basically, the game thinks there is a block where there actually isn't. it usually occurs when I delete a block and the game deletes the block, but thinks there is still a block there. the only way to fix this is to save the file, and then reload it.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:49:17 same with my engine :/
help 2021-06-11 20:49:11 yo can someone help me? I need a (preferably flexible) compact way to tighten these treads.
help 2021-06-11 20:50:16 I tried ropes and suspension, but they really aren't great solutions. The ropes move too much, and the suspension is a little too buggy
help 2021-06-11 20:50:42 I would use motor locks, but they compress much less
help 2021-06-11 20:51:21 (rope goes to 20% of it's original size and motor lock goes to 50%)
help 2021-06-11 20:51:51 here's a picture of the treads spawned in.
help 2021-06-12 01:10:06 it can't be more than 1 block tall, and has to compress the ENTIRE thing into about a 1-3 block long section while being a max of 4 blocks wide. Doesn't matter tho. after experimenting for about an hour, I finally found a way to use motor locks by chunking it out into multiple parts rather than 1 big part.
bug-reports 2021-06-12 01:33:43 soooooo I just noticed something. I'm making some tank treads, but they consist mostly of disconnectors and motors (1 motor 3 disconnectors for every 1 block of length). Since my current tread uses just over 500 disconnectors (I'll prob get it down to 400-480, I've noticed that the disconnectors sometimes don't respond when in large quantities. What I mean is, I have the same keybind for all disconnectors, yet sometimes only some go off, and I have to press the button twice. I've noticed it's usually the most recently placed disconnectors that do this.
bot-central 2021-06-12 02:26:02 !rank
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:29 nah
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:32 they still work
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:40:37 it's just the startup sequence
bug-reports 2021-06-12 02:41:03 also I designed these treads because literally no other treads could handle the kind of stress I'm putting these through XD
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:02:35 lol
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:03:00 it would be worse if the button deployed a weapon and you died because it took too long to deploy
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:09:28 ummmmmm
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:09:31 my game just broke ;-;
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:10:31 
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:10:31 first the game said loading... then, when I opened and closed the menu, there was 3 of everything
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:10:31 
creations-chat 2021-06-12 03:11:37 if you want good colors, use a color picker from image, hover over the color u want and input that into plane crazy.
help 2021-06-12 03:12:02 in my opinion I would use treads.
help 2021-06-12 03:12:40 they look the best, have great hill climbing ability, and good handling
help 2021-06-12 03:13:36 I just created a new tread pattern that looks more realistic and performs better too, if you want that.
help 2021-06-12 03:13:47 otherwise, conveyors
help 2021-06-12 03:14:02 only downside to conveyors is they don't have great handling
bug-reports 2021-06-12 03:44:10 this is a bug within roblox. Basically you go so fast, that it breaks the physics engine. Next time try not to go 55.5 billion blocks per second XD
bot-central 2021-06-12 03:44:57 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-06-12 03:45:12 ?rhelp
bot-central 2021-06-12 03:45:21 ;-;
creations-chat 2021-06-12 21:25:04 ngl the tip looks like a backwards aerospike jet engine lol
help 2021-06-12 21:26:45 I might be able to help
help 2021-06-12 21:26:54 it'll be long tho
