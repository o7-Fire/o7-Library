general 2021-05-19 01:12:48 Rip
general 2021-05-19 01:14:25 Well it could be from lag

general 2021-05-19 01:17:01 Well also we don’t really know how rockets work
general 2021-05-19 01:18:16 mhm
general 2021-05-19 01:18:41 If Rick could he could try to rework the rockets
general 2021-05-19 01:18:59 Make them more effective when tracking and other things
general 2021-05-19 01:19:24 I agree
general 2021-05-19 01:19:39 Mhm
general 2021-05-19 01:20:25 Well yeah it’s weird how they would work
general 2021-05-19 01:20:50 Sometimes they won’t track or just disperse when I fire them at someone
general 2021-05-19 01:21:06 makes me frustrated
general 2021-05-19 01:24:16 Yeah
