general 2021-01-11 05:35:31 sort of
general 2021-01-11 05:36:02 until you realise russia is a cornered power that wants to bully its neighbours to hold onto the last shred of influence it has
general 2021-01-11 05:36:06 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-01-11 05:36:17 so your homeland is fucked
general 2021-01-11 05:36:30 but not actually because ukraine strong
general 2021-01-11 05:36:40 ukraine will never fall
general 2021-01-11 05:36:52 of course
general 2021-01-11 05:37:03 Ukrainians like the US as a country
general 2021-01-11 05:37:10 they just dont like the people
general 2021-01-11 05:37:18 its opposite with russians
general 2021-01-11 05:37:26 and why as a country?
general 2021-01-11 05:37:40 the US is the only country even willing to help ukraine
general 2021-01-11 05:37:42 so theres that
general 2021-01-11 05:37:55 russia sees it that way
