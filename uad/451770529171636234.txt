plane-crazy 2021-04-13 22:52:56 cringe
help 2021-04-13 23:49:12 ik why its rolling right
help 2021-04-13 23:49:13 i think
help 2021-04-13 23:49:56 you are best off having counter rotating blades at the top of your heli
help 2021-04-13 23:50:01 it will stop the roll
help 2021-04-13 23:50:19 because then they will counteract the torque your blades are applying on your heli
help 2021-04-13 23:50:25 ah
help 2021-04-13 23:50:52 make another motor2 with a slight roll on it, to act as trim
help 2021-04-13 23:51:15 if that causes too much wobble, then you could just use a regular motor with lock enabled
help 2021-04-13 23:51:20 and manually adjust roll trim
help 2021-04-13 23:51:30 do you get what i mean?
help 2021-04-14 00:08:46 its in servo mode right
help 2021-04-14 00:08:54 wait
help 2021-04-14 00:08:58 what are you trying to do with the motor
help 2021-04-14 00:10:05 weird
help 2021-04-14 00:10:13 try 179.99?
help 2021-04-14 00:11:26 its probably just trying to find the shortest path to 180
help 2021-04-14 00:11:36 which could be either direction
help 2021-04-14 00:11:51 so 179.99 ensures that one direction is always shorter
help 2021-04-14 00:14:45 i hate trying to stack motors
help 2021-04-14 00:14:51 cause they go all wobbly
help 2021-04-14 00:22:25 seperate roll controls for each prop
help 2021-04-14 00:22:31 then you can roll, and yaw
help 2021-04-14 00:25:51 use seperate keybinds
help 2021-04-14 00:25:54 for the roll on front prop
help 2021-04-14 00:25:55 and back
help 2021-04-14 00:31:25 it will do
help 2021-04-14 00:31:26 but wdym
help 2021-04-14 00:37:14 whats wrong
