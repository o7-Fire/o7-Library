general 2020-05-02 21:49:22 wdym
general 2020-05-02 21:49:41 how
general 2020-05-02 21:50:04 my sub has a full interior
general 2020-05-02 21:50:23 I am very disapointed I tough my sub would be good but nvm
general 2020-05-02 21:50:29 idk what is missing
general 2020-05-02 21:50:32 I spent 2+ hours
general 2020-05-02 21:50:35 For nothing
general 2020-05-02 21:51:21 i spent so much time on this submarine it was my first build
general 2020-05-02 21:51:28 i dont know what is missing
general 2020-05-02 21:51:34 to me it looks very nice
general 2020-05-02 21:51:55 what is missing to my sub
general 2020-05-02 21:51:58 i dont understand
general 2020-05-02 21:52:00 how is it not good
general 2020-05-02 21:52:18 what is aesthetics
general 2020-05-02 21:52:41 what would i add to put style to a submarine
general 2020-05-02 21:52:55 maybe decorations?
general 2020-05-02 21:52:56 its a submarine
general 2020-05-02 21:53:10 I literally spent 2 hours building the interior to make it look realistic
general 2020-05-02 21:53:23 But you guys say it isnt aesthetic
general 2020-05-02 21:53:44 that has no aesthetics
general 2020-05-02 21:53:49 its just like mine
general 2020-05-02 21:53:50 but bigger
general 2020-05-02 21:54:53 I guess building isn't for me, I put all my effort to make my sub look nice and make an interior with kitchen, shower ect but it stills lacks something. I am just gonna leave this game there is no point for me bye
general 2020-05-02 21:55:38 the thing is, i dont understand what I need to add to make this usbmarine better, ot me its reall nice
general 2020-05-02 21:56:30 what aesthetic things do you want me to add to make my submarine "better"
