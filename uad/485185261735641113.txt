general 2023-07-14 10:08:05 decreases time you are able to pay attention to things
general 2023-07-14 10:09:31 If you only watch 5 second videos for hours a day, ofc its gonna make you more comfortable to quick videos instead of watching long and detailed ones
general 2023-07-14 10:11:48 not universal, but definitely in a bigger portion of tiktok users

general 2023-07-14 10:19:36 Im so confused as to why the island states are the top obesity rate countries

general 2023-07-14 10:33:45 the chinese beat you so bad , you isolated yourself from the worlds for hundreds of years
general 2023-07-14 10:36:00 Iron Man is still better tho
general 2023-07-14 10:38:03 why do the people of your country have the need to work so badly to the point where there is a word for people who reset character due to working so much
general 2023-07-14 10:38:52 OK
general 2023-07-14 10:39:49 come to germany and eat a good ol Bratwurst to relax for once
general 2023-07-14 10:40:28 Most is seafood right?
general 2023-07-14 10:40:59 our curry is spicy
general 2023-07-14 10:41:20 so japanese just like sweet stuff?
general 2023-07-14 10:41:32 you say it like they make every other food sweet
general 2023-07-14 10:42:46 oh ok
general 2023-07-14 10:43:43 one critique I always hear french people saying about german restaurants is that we give giant portions to satisfy your hunger where as in france they make little portions to satisfy your tasing
general 2023-07-14 10:44:31 I only see them rarely in germany, mostly in non big brand stores
general 2023-07-14 10:45:22 they banned them in america
general 2023-07-14 10:45:51 bc they didnt understand that there is a toy inside of the chocolate and then said kids could chock on it
general 2023-07-14 10:46:44 I saw some pretty cool japanese cornflakes here tho, with pokemon theme
general 2023-07-14 10:48:19 those are awesome
general 2023-07-14 10:49:55 what is udon
general 2023-07-14 10:51:10 so thicker and differently seasoned ramen?
general 2023-07-14 10:52:10 like pressed flat?
general 2023-07-14 10:52:18 oh
general 2023-07-14 10:52:58 but it sticks together
general 2023-07-14 10:53:41 my friends took me to a korean restaurant once and I sucked so badly at eating with chop sticks
general 2023-07-14 10:55:25 ok
general 2023-07-14 10:55:50 In germany we have alot of potatos
general 2023-07-14 10:55:59 and sausages
general 2023-07-14 10:56:22 but one thing I gotta recommend
general 2023-07-14 10:56:29 is "Wiener Schnitzel"
general 2023-07-14 10:57:04 well it can be made out of different meat, chicken or pig is usally used, I prefer chicken
general 2023-07-14 10:57:30 idk what its called in english but its like a hammer to hit meat
general 2023-07-14 10:57:47 anyway after doing that
general 2023-07-14 10:57:53 you "panieren" the meat
general 2023-07-14 10:58:26 for that you need 2 tihngs atleast
general 2023-07-14 10:58:38 k
general 2023-07-14 10:58:52 1. you crack open eggs and put the liquid in a bowl and mix
general 2023-07-14 10:59:07 the second is breadcrumbs
general 2023-07-14 10:59:28 or a special dough with is a bit better called " Paniermehl"
general 2023-07-14 10:59:41 and then you put the meat in the egg liquid and then in the breadcrumps
general 2023-07-14 10:59:45 so it sticks to the meat
general 2023-07-14 10:59:48 and in the end
general 2023-07-14 11:00:08 you have a soft meat which is surrounded by a crusty layer
general 2023-07-14 11:00:34 its hard to describe
general 2023-07-14 11:00:46 but I think googleing it would shine some light on it
general 2023-07-14 11:01:26 polandðŸ’€
general 2023-07-14 11:02:10 first we will take back KÃ¶nigsberg from russia
general 2023-07-14 11:02:42 and then ima need that strassburg back from france
general 2023-07-14 11:02:50 and then memel from lithuania
general 2023-07-14 11:02:57 and then danzig from poland
general 2023-07-14 11:02:59 and krakowice
general 2023-07-14 11:03:22 and then I need some land from denmark that was ours
general 2023-07-14 11:03:26 and then luxembourg
general 2023-07-14 11:03:31 and then Sudetenland
general 2023-07-14 11:03:44 everytime I play hoi4
general 2023-07-14 11:04:14 nobody cares tho
general 2023-07-14 11:04:25 like our grandparents didnt care for world climate
general 2023-07-14 11:04:35 this is a problem I will hand down a few generations
general 2023-07-14 11:05:05 fr
general 2023-07-14 11:05:18 why did they shut down our nuclear power plants
general 2023-07-14 11:05:34 fr
general 2023-07-14 11:05:51 and then we import the nuclear plant energy of france
general 2023-07-14 11:06:18 man idk what the goverments doing
general 2023-07-14 11:06:31 sad times
general 2023-07-14 11:06:37 and prices in general went a bit up
general 2023-07-14 11:07:59 ðŸ’€
general 2023-07-14 11:08:12 I think he is a lil confused
general 2023-07-14 11:11:14 if the usa and soviet union hadnt offered german scientist a place to work then things like the atomic submarines wouldnt have been invented, preventing the cuba crisis
general 2023-07-14 11:14:20 cant make your own?
