creations-chat 2022-04-18 09:51:08 some feedback pls?
creations-chat 2022-04-18 09:57:16 hmm okay...brb
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:05:50 they aren't (and don't) hit the ground. Maybe the perspective makes it look like it but it isn't. btw heres the angle. The propellers won't hit the ground in a certain angle (as long as it isn't moving)
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:08:35 here...
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:12:47 here...u weren't specific
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:18:15 yo bro chill, like i said u weren't specific. u asked for better angles, i gave u better angles. u asked for top, side, under and back, i gave it. just- chill. okay? i dont wanna argue about this so...
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:22:14 uhh sure? am i joinable?
creations-chat 2022-04-18 10:27:45 nah that won't be necessary. sometime?

creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:04:08 nahhh i just put a gun in the fuel stick thingy for some improvisionsðŸ˜­
creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:06:04 just right. a little more work though on the paintjob
creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:11:43 lmao this is waht i mean by âœ¨ IMPROVISIONS âœ¨
creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:13:32 how to do that?
creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:15:59 looks like a sausage ðŸ¥²  should i remove it? btw thanks for the gun tip

creations-chat 2022-04-18 11:46:40 but its too thin. i will not add it cuz my unit doesn't have it anyways
creations-chat 2022-04-18 12:57:56 mine is 147, 147, 147. idk up to u

help 2022-04-19 08:21:23 wdym
help 2022-04-19 08:22:12 it would be the only choice unless youre willing to motorlock it. should i make a motorlock model?
help 2022-04-19 08:22:44 sure
help 2022-04-19 08:34:03 okay so i just copied the base of where you tail could be. the first photo shows the tail unlocked. the second and third shows it locked and angled (ofc with motor 1s since motor 2s can be a bit glitchy in motorlock.) the 4th photo shows the recommended settings (powered and locked is required) but the rest is customisable to your liking.
help 2022-04-19 08:34:10 hope it helped (pls read the message first)
help 2022-04-19 08:38:01 wait btw- the tail is connected like this with a trail
creations-chat 2022-04-19 08:39:23 yo thats too good

help 2022-04-19 08:56:06 oof uhh idk
help 2022-04-19 09:21:25 its the only way though. unless u would do some extreme motorlocking

help 2022-04-27 00:56:40 hii
help 2022-04-27 00:57:02 pls help how do i make an f22 nose its complicated ðŸ˜­
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:34:12 Hiii! This is my mini su-57 (WIP)

Since it is a mini its hard to hide exposed motors so im sorry about that. The livery will be taken from the su-57 in top gun: maverick. pls share your feedback
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:37:08 as i said it is a WIP (work in progress). I will do the tail soon when I finish the others. do you mind giving feedback about the overall thing?
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:40:32 Thanks for your feedback! I honestly think the su 57 is designed to be thin as it is so I tried to replicate it with a half block scaled build. Pretty similar in my opinion but i guess-
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:44:01 i know right! But i did try my best to make the build look accurate and not too thick. I mean, it is a mini build afterall it would be a hassle to keep all the motors hidden
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:46:21 welp...

what can i do-
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:48:22 yeah lmao I build it in a format where I stuck two half blocks together to create a block ðŸ˜†  , well, yeah


It is not 1 block wide btw

Plus, If I put all the motor work on the cockpit space, that would be impossible
creations-chat 2022-06-19 12:55:21 i had to do it because if i didn't It would result in a fat structure


bro what ðŸ’€


yes it is and looks terifying

yep, makes it different, and fatter.
creations-chat 2022-06-19 13:11:44 u need some sleep mate
creations-chat 2022-06-19 13:24:04 yall really attacking my su 57 ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-06-19 13:30:58 i was talking to <@795222091259445278> but ok
creations-chat 2022-06-19 13:41:54 thank u
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:06:12 hello! this is the updated su-57 felon (inspired by top gun: maverick) pls share any feedback it would be appreciated for future progress

btw what livery should I put?
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:08:13 idk any way to hide the locks since it is a mini build. I also didn't put any tnts, do u mean the fireworks?

oh, that would be so hard. if i show the build mode you would see the complicated stuff
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:11:07 i dont have any choice i guess
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:13:09 the whole build is a half-block thick. how am i supposed to hide it without it being exposed?

the real aircraft is thin. I mean i went for accuracy and well there i go

im sure it wouldn't bother when the paintjob is done
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:49:21 what ðŸ˜­

but my hard work ðŸ˜­

are you serious?
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:54:07 idk man, its my first time making a jet this good. i would lose all motivation to make it all from the start

i appreciate all your advise, but id rather stick with this one. thanks
creations-chat 2022-06-20 09:56:46 what should i make it?


its really thin, wdym?
creations-chat 2022-06-20 10:00:19 are u saying i should make it half-block thin?

i mean, its not that fat
creations-chat 2022-06-20 10:09:18 its alright with the size. its already 1 block thin
creations-chat 2022-06-20 10:11:33 thanks for the tip

creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:33:10 im so peaceful ðŸ˜­ yall chill out im gonna go offline for now


If yall really are "experts" (which by the way is a cringe thing to say) then why not keep cool with some new players
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:35:11 idk man im going to sleep

yes my pillows are warm
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:50:23 Hmm...how about 2motorlocked half wedge down 1x2's slapped on together?
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:52:46 yep, sorry for the confusion

this technique would probably be the most convenient, since you already have a big motorlock tower there in that thing
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:58:08 lmao imagine bad word usage
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:03:04 soo whose the bad one here;
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:05:14 that was my point the whole time like ever since
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:07:32 well atleast i do something rather than plane crazy, thats why im not so good at it.

all you do is cause some no big deal argument and all this happens

Now everyone, consider shutting up so everything is quiet
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:09:54 we supposed to be talking about creations here, right :troll:
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:12:54 thicc

creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:18:20 to make up for my cringe su-57, should i make an f18?

i just watched top gun so I still have some motivation left

thanks, i guess

creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:43:25 bro i thought this was thrust vectoring.

idk what a Cachalot whale looks like but definitely not like that
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:47:53 hmm... fix it, make it so the fin is a locked wing panel 1x2. Then fix the tail, its too thick

people have high standards nowadays, duh
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:53:09 i guess it is what it is, you literally rely on people to see if your creation on some roblox game is nice

ive been waiting for an update ever since, rick has to update it
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:56:17 well then most people are gonna be like "well i bet you can't do better" and "why don't u just do it yourself"
creations-chat 2022-06-24 14:59:43 that wso will come out of the jet with scoliosis bro

btw i know its just the half block but is it really tilted in the rel f14?
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:02:13 bro <@717225155029631057> the f14 cockpit only has tilting on the pilots side
creations-chat 2022-06-24 15:06:11 woah thats sick. btw can it go on like a straight 45 degree angle?
cooool

general 2022-08-18 11:01:54 how to suggest?
bot-central 2022-08-18 11:02:35 ?shelp
creations-chat 2022-08-20 05:57:15 the build is still in progress. Took me hours to make and im not done yet. the paintjob is temporary ( i will change it). pretty accurate imo (btw the build is a stark drone)
creations-chat 2022-08-20 06:21:58 i guess. move on
creations-chat 2022-08-20 15:04:46 yall i somehow managed to add a ton of details and the drone is 60% complete (dont mind some of the goofy parts, i will fix them as well as the paintjob) well uhh, dont call me a su 57 mf thank you
creations-chat 2022-08-20 15:28:21 any opinons on my WIP stark drone???

btw ignore the seat on the upper left its for testing
creations-chat 2022-08-22 00:18:36 Who here has watched Top Gun: Maverick?

creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:38:05 plane crazy is getting boring but ill wait since i can bore myself with school
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:40:08 where do other people even get updates about the progress like is there some sort of secret channel or something?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:43:18 what im trying to point out is this message, like where did coolbean even get it? is it even on the plane crazy discord?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:51:56 imo, if pc2 had updates like skins, or like too much updates that are not necessary at all, it wouldn't be the same game we all have right now. I still want the next plane crazy to be the classic sandbox creative game we all have cuz all og players might get overwhelmed with how the new mechanics of the game will be. And new players might forget the main point of the game (building and being creative) because of the frequent unnecessary updates. But you know, i'm honestly looking forward to the new fun stuff cuz thats what we want right? Having fun is the whole point! Well to sum it up, rick must have done a lot of cool stuff for pc2 and i personally find it pretty exciting (sorry if this is a big speech i'm just saying my opinions on pc2, probably shouldnt have written my 4th grade essay here)

why the heck would you want shapes stamped on your build? thats just not plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:55:07 i see ur point there<:clueless:942802644043464734>  imagine having quests and levels

btw plane crazy 2 comes out at the end of summer right/ when is that?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:57:25 
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:00:57 this actually makes me wonder, we will have to modify all our builds if there will be new blocks (like wedge 1x5 etc.) to substitue angle locking, right? cuz all our builds in pc2 will be out dated and have no new stuff

<@410455661814480896> did you know humans have a thing where they shut up?

ikr, slowmode is a big L
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:04:37 wth "dawg"ðŸ’€

creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:10:59 btw im making a stark drone (ignore the paintjob i just covered it with gray and ill finish it later) opinions?

the white paintjob is temporary too
<@527653676022628353> where specifically?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:13:03 i suggest you scrap it
that is nothing like a p51
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:16:03 from ur angle it looked like a capybaras a hole
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:18:08 and fix that intake its going to suck in that wing, and scrap it
creations-chat 2022-08-22 02:20:34 what if motorlock just had its own block like"compressed block" or should we just maintain motorlock supremacy?<:Motor:559531201237352451>

yes..

saying that wont make ur jet better
or is it even a jet
