plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:07:52 I started today lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:08:10 I’m just building like I would in plane crazy but more detailed using the resize tool and it works
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:08:30 building a 1:1 ship and the interior looks awesome so far because of how small I can get the blocks to be
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:08:49 fair
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:09:28 I used to like rickje until he just gave up on pc and pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:09:36 so fp is literally the best option rn
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:09:46 it’s like a remaster of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:10:08 zero updates on pc, and pc2 is 5% done after two years
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:10:32 rickje is taking inspiration from rockstar on releasing games on time
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:11:07 at least hire a dev team damn
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:11:25 surely he’d be making fat stacks after setting the jet pack to like 250 robux
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:11:36 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:12:16 I’d much rather support flight point at this point, it looks like it has a much brighter future then plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:12:23 even currently
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:13:11 you know it’s bad when people start shitting on you in your own discord server
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:14:03 the motor hat is pretty cool but it’s likely received more development time then plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 09:15:21 if your roblox server isn’t moderated by lgbtq trans furry redditors is it even a roblox server
