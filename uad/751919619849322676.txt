creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:46:38 to prove its not hard to make an atleast identifiable build, unlike the the guy who made a platform and a few blocks on some motor 2s

like, you can tell thats a C-RAM turret.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:48:49 just out of curiosity, airpiglet. what are your standards? let me see one of your builds. i just want to see what you think is a good build, im not saying this out of offense.  i just want to get an idea of your standards. (i understand this comes across very rude, i genuinely dont mean it in that type of attitude)
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:53:43 yeah, for example my U-Boat is one of my favorite builds and it has little to no motor lock, and  it got 116 - 7 on <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:59:02 i dont know what to say to that, thats just a great thing generally
lol
i dont really talk much here, ive posted a few builds but thats about it
we need so many more people like you in this server, quite honestly
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:01:47 i remember my shit looking mig-15 but at the time it was like pure gold for me, i dont have any images but i think its still on an old alt account of mine
id love to find it again
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:04:08 yeah, because you didnt have standards for your builds so it was easier to build freely and have a good time
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:06:12 i learned motor locking from my friend, and it was like we where "growing up" in plane crazy almost. we got so excited and i learned all complex techniques by myself after that.. that friend isnt online anymore and hasnt played plane crazy in a year or 2 

p.s this slow mo is a bitch
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:12:24 my first builds are completely lost, i dont even remember what they where
i only remember that i loved the mig 15 and i made one and then remade it again once
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:15:20 dude this looks awesome
i tried making a chinook recently but it works horribly and i cant get the rotor to work right, 
i remember one of my first builds was a chinook and i somehow got that to work better than my one now
its also unpainted
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:19:52 i might try something like that soon, how well does it fly?
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:22:14 awesome man, ill try that technique out on my chinook but ill try to paraphrase it a bit just not to completely copy that approach

anyway i need to be on my way, nice to see the community actually have some positivity
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:26:05 thanks a lot, i dont really know what else to say other than that lol, thanks

creations-chat 2023-04-04 02:42:26 <@869381395712196708>

be careful man i think you can get in trouble for uploading WIPs

*im not completely sure tho just sayin i think its a risk*

post WIPs in this channel i believe. but you can get warned for putting them in <#384025409945337856>

no problem man im just worried abt u getting warned.

up to you but i think i could find the rule, 

id do it just to be safe


(also really cool build man)

yeah thats awesome, i dont usually have the patience or will to create builds bigger than around 1 - 1.5 plots
