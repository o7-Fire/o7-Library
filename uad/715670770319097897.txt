plane-crazy 2023-06-11 19:15:30 Do you guys remember when Plane Crazy 2 was being worked on. I wonder if they are still working on it now or if it's abandoned, 'cause they said it was releasing in Summer last year and it's Summer again.
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 19:16:45 The last freaking update to plane crazy was in 2022 and the last peice of news we got on plane crazy 2 was in 2022. Nah bro they just used plane crazy 2 as an excuse to leave the game in dirt.

general 2023-06-11 19:33:28 the fitness gram pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test.
general 2023-06-11 19:34:38 The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!â€¦ Start. ding

general 2023-06-11 19:55:25 "In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer."

"Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before."
general 2023-06-11 19:56:02 you've obviously never listened to doom music while in the gym
general 2023-06-11 19:56:11 it's fire af

general 2023-06-11 19:57:51 well to be fair. if i weighed 700 pounds I would be dead
general 2023-06-11 19:58:18 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-06-11 19:58:49 how does doom a game that isn't that long. turn u into a fatass (like you for example)
general 2023-06-11 19:59:57 NGL sounds like something someone who's kinda angry they can't play an 18+ game would say.
general 2023-06-11 20:01:15 so we're not gonna talk about the fact you've clearly been on plane crazy for 24 hours a day to get a rank in a funni discord server. Alrighty then
general 2023-06-11 20:01:29 doom eternal? i play doom 2016 most of the time
general 2023-06-11 20:02:13 Lol so that proves my point even more then. if you tried flying a plane rl it wouldn't be able to take off.

general 2023-06-11 20:06:08 to be fair you can't say something with no proof

general 2023-06-11 20:08:36 if i was you i would kill myself too. Cause clearly you just say things with no evidence and it probs gets tiring attempting to find a good peice of valid evidence just to find out it's not actually valid
