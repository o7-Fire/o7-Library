plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:08:07 The forklift reminds me kind of this
plane-crazy 2020-01-31 03:09:24 If the forklift keeps tilting you should probably separate the wheels further apart and put the weight towards the ground

creations-chat 2020-01-31 06:22:31 <@456226577798135808> Constructive criticism now with knowledge of base material:  1.Side wing should be a bit smaller if possible. 2. Maybe try using triangle wedge 1x2 and triangle wedgeblock 1x2 to get more of a rounded shape for the cockpit
