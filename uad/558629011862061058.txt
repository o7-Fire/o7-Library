plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:57:01 Ah wait
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:57:04 Let me resize
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:59:24 Uh
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:59:30 Ah ok there
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:59:39 That helps a little
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:59:55 Well yeah, you ARE doing pixel art, what did you expect
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 16:11:30 Do you happen to use Half blocks, Half block wedge and wedge for the eye?
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 16:12:22 If you use those it still gives it a squarish look to it, give it more ***curve***
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 16:13:17 For something that simple I don't think motor lock is all that needed but that works too

Oh you meant the eye itself, I was talking about the shape overall
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 02:13:39 In a situation like this, desync is you're bestfriend
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 02:51:16 Oh Bruh they are in the same server that I am

plane-crazy 2022-04-13 11:54:09 I should probably have made it with 4 joints rather then 3 so it's a proper a arachnid leg but oh well.
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 11:59:02 Legs are fun

the-dump 2022-04-13 18:36:17 
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:44:11 You use fabric for your wings? I use ice does that make any difference other than weight? (Both fabric and ice are both lighter than normal block).
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:45:22 Sorry, aside from both weight and  friction
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:45:43 Should have added friction to that message
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:46:04 Does fabric also react the same way?
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:46:12 With magnets I mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:46:22 Ok that's the weight (probably)
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:46:41 Fabric and Ice are the same
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:46:54 Both are lighter than normal materials
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:47:03 Yeah 🗿
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:47:38 Have you never checked the materials weight side by side using suspensions?
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:47:51 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:47:52 Fair
plane-crazy 2022-04-13 18:50:48 I'm concerned to ask as to how long you've been playing PC and haven't known that ice is next to frictionless <:what:644996672048463942>

plane-crazy 2022-04-14 10:59:48 Both are in the shadows and should be the same shade, even against the light it's still off, it's a minor inconvenience but now I can't get my mind out of it.

plane-crazy 2022-04-23 02:40:23 Did something happen to roblox while I was out?
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 02:42:58 Basically a racing game on trying to get the fastest time in a track, there are two most common controls, Controller and Keyboard, Controller takes advantage on the fine movements so you can make specific angles of approach when moving around (Think of the glitched mouse here in PC) and Keyboard is.. well.. it's a fucking keyboard, literally just fucking click clank n' shit, meaning the amount of time to move is much more sharper and quicker.
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 02:43:34 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 02:44:24 "Think of the glitched mouse here in PC"

creations-chat 2022-04-24 13:57:52 Point being, when it comes to sandbox game like these, be it Trailmakers, Beseige, ScrapMechanic, MachineCraft, Space Engineers, etc.. you WILL have that one person who does weebshit like these, and honestly? It's amazing that they even did it in the first place.

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:54:10 Just me or using OBS on Roblox makes post recordings shit?

Also can't figure out why it tends to steer to the right despite everything to be symmetrical, is it Roblox just being Roblox? or is there something I don't know?
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:58:12 Yeah it's OBS being OBS, it drops to 41-54fps when I open up a big build and move around with it but apparently that's a fucking lie
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:00:29 Nobody still has answered my 2nd question, I'm still assuming it's roblox being roblox
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:01:27 For the most part my settings are default aside from Output
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:02:05 I think.. Haven't bothered to fully learn the nicks and knacks of OBS
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:02:47 Aight, just gonna mess around with it for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:07:58 Huh would you look at that, fps is less shit now that I messed with a bit of the settings, neat.

plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:54:30 Hm this is an odd way to build
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:55:27 Reminds me of the time when someone used a client (hack?) to copy my build block for block
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:55:54 Nono they're building it, not spawing it
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:56:01 They left
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:56:12 They probably knew what I was doing lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:56:17 I wish I had OBS on
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:56:45 Yeah the game has been shitting itself alot in the recent days
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:56:55 Much more than usual I should say
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:57:00 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:58:13 Tbh I didn't even notice it until everyone in chat was complaining about it
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:58:35 Until now nothing has changed for me, idk why
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 14:58:54 Eh roblox just being roblox I guess
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:07:07 I just saw that the game updated 8 hours ago, please tell me it was a patch for the shitty server handling <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:07:42 Thank fuck
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:41:30 One block is keeping this wing together <:hampter:849530858913267753>
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 08:44:50 Wait I was about to say something else but I just thought of something
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:55:25 If he does get in, it will surely be the game of all time
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:55:47 I think I had a stroke there
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 18:02:32 Reminds me of the person I met over at PVP where their mech that has a weapon that works as both a spear and shredder.
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 18:11:06 Tried figuring out how they did if, failed miserably due to my pea sized knowledge of how magnets work ingame lol

plane-crazy 2022-10-14 19:26:25 <:oouuh:650267837801168896> this one had an nword before lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:44:46 More build slots would be nice, maybe then I can finally complete my list of builds with monster motifs.

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 03:40:36 Ah that's normal
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 03:40:50 Don't know why it works like that but it's pretty useful

plane-crazy 2023-01-29 23:40:56 Ayo bruh why tf does this thing look like it's built by Galac-Tec
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 07:49:50 Aw bruh, this is the 2nd day in a row I spot someone trying to use motor 2 instead of angle locking <:depressionviamobiledevice:918683515984441435>
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 17:47:48 Man looking back, I hate the fact that I unironically accidentally wrote two "is" in the sentence but I think it makes it even better

plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:37:36 Roblox
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:37:40 That's why
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:38:28 Bruh like I said, Roblox
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:39:46 If I did then most of my signs in my builds wouldn't be tagged
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:40:28 Sad seeing my builds getting tagged over the years tbh
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:40:44 It's like each time I spawn it one more sign gets tagged
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:42:53 Ah that's normal, don't know why but Roblox doesn't like it if you repeat a text twice, aside from special cases like "IIIIIII" "]]]]]]" or smth.
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:43:57 Hell, just typing "Angel" twice tags it
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 21:44:15 I just want to type "[Angel 01]" ffs

plane-crazy 2023-02-04 15:36:15 I want to kms (keep myself safe), totally
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 15:38:25 Uhh.. use magnets and disconnectors to keep the hand together, then make the hand use motor2 with a similar set up as a missile and just make it fly back to you to connect the hand to the body.

I remember someone did something similar in pvp, the hand acted like a shredder <:reallynow:1007116737134731294>
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 15:39:22 Oh god it's gotten so much worse since the last time I saw this thing

Aw hell nah, they have a giant anime woman looking down at them at all times.
creations-chat 2023-02-11 15:22:28 Yes, you can follow people around and it's especially fun in PVP

plane-crazy 2023-02-16 16:27:20 don't
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:32:54 Just found out why my jets are absolute garbage in pvp, turns out rockets count as a subgrid and is affected by hover pads <:what:1027285303351840868>
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:36:50 Yep, turns out I've been redoing my good jets non-stop trying to figure out what's wrong, all for basically nothing
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:37:48 2500+ before it starts wobbling
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:38:48 I usually don't need to make it that fast so the average between my builds are probably 1300(ish?)
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:39:28 Sure
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:42:05 Wdym? I didn't deny your statement
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:42:43 Ah
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:42:44 fair
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 03:44:27 Mix of both WASD and Motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 04:04:32 Idk it was the first and the main control type I used a few years ago, It was a struggle to relearn it but I find it fun
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 04:05:32 Interesting
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 04:15:11 Crazy how a single cutter on a jet and at a high enough speed can completely change the way you play the game
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 04:16:20 Well.. not really but you get the point
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 05:03:29 Man what the hell am I doing?

plane-crazy 2023-02-18 14:16:17 This looks nice though
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 18:05:03 Man it's been over a year since I accidentally deleted Zepha, I'll miss using it.
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:15:45 Weird looking Ornithopter I've made, it does provide it's own thrust but the empty part looked strange without something there.

plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:19:10 Brooo look at this side profile <:what:1027285303351840868>
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:23:14 Eh.. people mostly scout for you in-game instead of just joining a server, it's like a "You join when someone in the group let's you in" kinda basis.
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:24:13 I absolutely butchered that wording but you get the point
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:26:28 You guys have networking? <a:sadboihours:799784352048480256>
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:27:23 Ah I just meant that you make connections with people in discord, eh nvm
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:29:51 Ah that makes sense, I come from games like From the Depths, Space Engineers, MachineCraft, TechTech, etcc.. and those games are mostly singleplayer focused (aside from SE).
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 07:30:24 I've been playing PC for like 4-5 years now and I'm still not used to it being multiplayer focused lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 10:49:58 What if?
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 11:11:14 Hm
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 11:26:14 Christ all the way to the 16th century lol?
plane-crazy 2023-02-19 11:26:46 I would've thought in the 1920-40s kinda thing but wow ok

creations-chat 2023-03-11 20:54:46 Oh hell nah bruh, are you actually 12?

Pardon my garbage Spanish but doesn't the 2nd part indicate that you're 12 years old or does the 12 refer to something else? Because from context clues I'm assuming the former over the latter.
creations-chat 2023-03-11 21:02:39 I'll take that as a yes that they're indeed an unde, Mods please do the funny on them.

the-dump 2023-03-11 23:03:17 This brings back great memories, I'd like to share a very special video. Jaded and Math set a trap for our group's lead Floof, it fails and both Jaded and Math die to their own trap.

creations-chat 2023-03-13 20:05:22 The mini bridge at the canyon is there, but I'm kinda sad that the large garage door to the west of the canyon and the little entry way into the facility wasn't made using text and unicode texts.
