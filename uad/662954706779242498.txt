general 2020-07-17 19:23:08 > YOU CAN USE BALLAST TANKS AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF VELOCITY ON A COLLECTIVE OF EXPLOSIVES?

general 2020-07-17 19:25:09 but we can also use liquid propellers as a source of velocity, correct?
general 2020-07-17 19:25:27 I see

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:06:47 but dont put them in a straight line tho so you have a bigger chance of hitting them
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:07:21 uh have to spam the firework keybind to actually kill shredders

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:12:36 and I only use this against spawn campers, and shredders.
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:13:05 it can also do a bombing run while going 450st/s with the autoclicker on the fireworks
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:13:35 so far I’ve killed 3 shredders and 8 spawn campers
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 17:13:58 and 5 turrets
