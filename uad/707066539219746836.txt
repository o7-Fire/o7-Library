plane-crazy 2022-08-12 10:34:13 is that a A-10 cross F-14 plane? an AF-24?
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 10:36:51 lol
general 2022-08-12 11:04:57 I'm curious about something
general 2022-08-12 11:05:44 in the 'aeronautical role' rules it says your plane cannot use helium, but what if that helium isn't to make it fly, but to just balance it out?
creations-chat 2022-08-12 11:13:52 hey guys, I'm curious about the rules for the VTOL engineer rank, if you use helium just to stable out the vehicle for flight and not the actual VTOL, is that still allowed or not?
creations-chat 2022-08-12 11:41:10 oh cool, when I get to lvl 3 I'll submit my F-35
edit: nvm I misread it
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:04:51 that looks awfully similar to themadvulpens design
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 04:02:59 that cat sounds broken lol
general 2022-08-17 12:05:00 I don't use fuel in my builds, I just like to fly around
general 2022-08-17 12:09:52 being more of a father figure than my actual father

general 2022-08-30 05:09:16 hey guys, I'm trying to get better at my builds, any tips for people still new to building?
general 2022-08-30 05:10:31 I have, I've looked at 3D models and images of the build but with how complex some of them are (F-117 and YF-23) its kinda hard
general 2022-08-30 05:11:17 but I wanna try to challenge myself
general 2022-08-30 05:11:30 I don't wanna get stuck in building similar planes
general 2022-08-30 05:12:25 I have, a MI-24 hind
general 2022-08-30 05:13:27 I'll try that after I've built 2 more planes and 1 more helicopter
general 2022-08-30 05:16:17 I have done some practice before with a MI-24 and F-22 (which I then turned into a F-35)
general 2022-08-30 05:16:53 I've also done a bayraktar
general 2022-08-30 05:17:55 so I've done 3 (technically 4, I still have 1 save of my old F-22) builds
