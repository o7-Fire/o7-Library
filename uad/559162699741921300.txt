general 2022-02-08 05:11:31 i hate being intercepted by hypermaneuverable he51's or chinese aircraft
general 2022-02-08 05:11:37 yea

general 2022-02-08 05:16:09 does it only target certain parts?
general 2022-02-08 05:16:41 i launched a missile directly at a plane which was moving very flat AoA and not turning that much and it missed even with close tracking
general 2022-02-08 05:16:57 why would it be op
