general 2023-07-15 21:50:46 Windows 11 isnt worth it
general 2023-07-15 21:53:51 The only true way to win against pcc to just to not take it  so seriously <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-07-15 21:55:35 Cant really do that
general 2023-07-15 21:55:43 Just harass someone
general 2023-07-15 21:55:47 That should be enough
general 2023-07-15 21:56:06 Then make it up then
general 2023-07-15 21:59:47 Can't  say much as you seem equally as bad from what ive seen<:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-07-15 22:00:50 Moment
general 2023-07-15 22:01:15 So real
general 2023-07-15 22:04:30 This is funny
general 2023-07-15 22:04:46 üçø
general 2023-07-15 22:05:23 He probably  drinks maple syrup
general 2023-07-15 22:05:46 So real
general 2023-07-15 22:05:52 Sugar
general 2023-07-15 22:06:20 Carmelized liquid
general 2023-07-15 22:07:42 I will like to collect data
general 2023-07-15 22:07:50 Why are mechs so weirdly rated in pcc
general 2023-07-15 22:08:51 Like i want to know what makes mech good and mech bad in terms of pcc preference
general 2023-07-15 22:09:22 Do they prefer the "western design" rather  than the traditional japanese esc design more
general 2023-07-15 22:09:48 Thats true
general 2023-07-15 22:10:12 I like mechanical design in general
general 2023-07-15 22:10:24 One point i would like to point out
general 2023-07-15 22:11:06 Ive seen a couple
general 2023-07-15 22:11:29 Design standpoints alot nowdayd are kinda bout the same due to pvp normalities be
general 2023-07-15 22:11:54 Like alot of mechs overuse the "stick sword" design
general 2023-07-15 22:12:45 I get how ranged is either unfair  or shit but i dig ranged weapond
general 2023-07-15 22:14:13 Not when your opponent dissapears for no reason lmao
general 2023-07-15 22:14:25 Pc issue but its really bad in emch fighting
general 2023-07-15 22:15:15 Another issue is how pvp got cripled due to cutters were made worse to counter shredders
general 2023-07-15 22:16:40 üò≠ mech pvp had become mostly client dependant
general 2023-07-15 22:17:09 Sometimes you hit someone in the most strategic plsces and nothing falls off
general 2023-07-15 22:17:19 Bold to assume they go outside
