general 2022-06-21 19:17:37 Is it possible to get bigger plots?
general 2022-06-21 19:20:23 If we can't have bigger plots then how do people make so big builds?
general 2022-06-23 18:42:37 is there anywhere I can post images?
general 2022-06-23 18:43:04 I have an *interesting* image to post
general 2022-06-23 18:44:09 won't let me post images
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 18:45:01 Why can't I post images here?
general 2022-06-23 18:48:09 Happy to inform you that <#925522972586967092> did not help at all
general 2022-06-23 18:49:02 How do I get that?
general 2022-06-23 18:51:02 the second option
general 2022-06-23 18:52:05 Well I hate reading so I'll just say what my image is
general 2022-06-23 18:52:27 Speed: 302918664192
general 2022-06-23 18:53:25 so no one reacting to the fact that I did several hundred thousand times the speed of sound
general 2022-06-23 18:53:43 Kind of to be expected by this game
general 2022-06-23 18:53:51 it is very common it seems
general 2022-06-23 18:54:00 Bro I'm 15
general 2022-06-23 18:54:06 holy
general 2022-06-23 18:54:18 that looks like it would kill my frames
general 2022-06-23 18:55:05 agreed
general 2022-06-23 18:55:10 3070 sucks
general 2022-06-23 18:55:31 ryzen 7
general 2022-06-23 18:55:49 5900 something I think
general 2022-06-23 18:56:32 I see gaming laptops as the same danger classifications as a small nuke so no
general 2022-06-23 18:57:15 sigma
general 2022-06-24 17:23:55 How big are the plots exactly?
general 2022-06-24 17:25:46 I have no way to respond to this. The victory is yours
general 2022-06-24 17:26:28 Actually how big are the plots doe?
general 2022-06-24 17:26:46 and height?
general 2022-06-24 17:27:15 thx
general 2022-06-24 17:27:28 hah
general 2022-06-24 17:27:30 funni
general 2022-06-24 17:28:23 Will I get an achievement for making a lift that works better as a lightspeed rocket then most of my actual rocket builds?
general 2022-06-24 17:32:38 bro any attempt I make at a plane just ends up spinning at mach 40 mid air
general 2022-06-24 17:32:54 the funny thing tho
general 2022-06-24 17:33:00 it is actually a skill issue
general 2022-06-24 17:49:57 Does plane crazy by some random chance have aerodynamics physics?
general 2022-06-24 17:50:07 **GUN**
general 2022-06-24 17:50:59 I am sorry what?
general 2022-06-24 17:51:03 Pistols on your back?
general 2022-06-24 17:51:25 not using the indicators is illegal
general 2022-06-24 17:51:40 Arent pistols supposed to be holster or chest mounted?
general 2022-06-24 17:53:02 ngl 50k is kinda cheap for an attack aircraft
general 2022-06-25 09:19:04 Why did I just see a pizza car with what looks like an L22?
general 2022-06-25 12:42:04 Anyone got any tips on how to make your plane not look like it was drawn by a 2 year old?
general 2022-06-25 12:42:28 what is motor lock?
general 2022-06-25 12:42:53 my plane looks like as if you left an icecream cone in the sun for an hour
general 2022-06-25 12:43:54 I have no idea what motorlock is so I'ma commit youtube real quick
general 2022-06-25 12:45:20 why does it look like an A-10 and a spaceship had a baby
general 2022-06-25 12:57:05 I really don't want to see that thing anywhere
general 2022-06-25 12:57:14 especially not during a war
general 2022-06-25 18:03:53 It's funny how the block limit doesn't do anything
general 2023-02-23 11:43:42 Sup
general 2023-02-23 11:43:56 Hello pinkname
general 2023-02-23 11:44:10 lol
general 2023-02-23 11:44:49 I was thinking of posting an image here but I guess I'll just say what it is instead.
general 2023-02-23 11:45:13 A friend of mine: MxtZoro#6277. Managed to achieve the fantastic speed of 609B km/s in plane crazy
general 2023-02-23 11:45:25 or about 20.3M times the speed of light
general 2023-02-23 11:45:47 Does anyone have any idea how it is even remotely possible to reach that speed?
general 2023-02-23 11:45:54 it should really be
general 2023-02-23 11:46:09 ...
general 2023-02-23 11:46:33 the fastest I've ever achieved was 1.2 times light speed
general 2023-02-23 11:47:08 can fly across the milkyway galaxy in 43h hours or do 2,040 round trips to the sun in the blink fo an eye
general 2023-02-23 11:47:15 anchor block
general 2023-02-23 11:47:41 no, it stops momentum completely
general 2023-02-23 11:48:07 I mean, you'll pull trillions of Gs and for a split second you'll be the densest object ever.
general 2023-02-23 11:49:51 I'ma gonna try and calculate how much a 75kg person would wheigh from an instant stop at 20.3M times the speed of light
general 2023-02-23 11:51:36 13,908,037,499,999,998,630,166,528 G's
general 2023-02-23 11:52:25 meaning that a 75kg person would for 1ms wheigh about 1,043,102,812,499,999,897,262,489,600 kg
general 2023-02-23 11:53:44 1,043,102,812B Megatonnes
