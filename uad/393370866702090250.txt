plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:24:56 Hey how do i make homing missiles
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:32:42 How to make homing missiles 😦 pls halp
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 20:13:58 Man this game could have so many more weaponss
general 2019-11-12 17:26:02 .
help 2019-12-11 19:36:23 How are we supossed to make a plane rotor and the direction changing thing on its tail
help 2019-12-11 19:36:31 I made a rotor
help 2019-12-11 19:36:46 But it keeps spinning the heli with it
help 2019-12-11 19:36:55 itself
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:39:40 Anyone has a idea why my helicopter keeps spinning with my rotor and it wont work
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:40:18 i did
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:40:23 but it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:41:02 Still doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:41:15 :
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:41:32 propellor blades
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:41:42 ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:42:02 normal wings/
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:42:03 ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:42:47 I saw those kinda rotors
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:43:05 the motors on each sides
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:44:55 Do the motors on the rotor need to have the same inclination controls or inverted
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:53:26 :/
general 2020-02-08 19:38:43 What about a motor that would fulfill the job of both motors with the press of a button?
general 2020-02-08 19:39:05 I mean the motor 2 is useful for when im driving the boat and using the turret
general 2020-02-08 19:39:14 But bad for when its stationary
general 2020-02-08 19:39:27 Servo
general 2020-02-08 19:39:29 Whats that
general 2020-02-08 19:39:32 I saw the setting
general 2020-02-08 19:40:10 Ok
general 2020-02-08 19:40:15 Ima go check it out thanks
general 2020-02-08 19:41:05 hm
general 2020-02-08 19:41:11 I checked it out
general 2020-02-08 19:41:17 Its not what i was asking for
general 2020-02-08 19:42:52 When im driving my boat and using the turret at the same time i have to use motor 2 to aim it well.When im not driving the boat it makes more sense to use motor 1 because the wasd ship control isnt used.Basically im asking for a motor that could become a motor 1 and motor 2 at the press of a button,motor 3?
general 2020-02-08 19:43:22 Its hard to aim a turret with motor 1 while im also using wasd for control
general 2020-02-08 19:43:33 Like try using wasd and qerf at the same time
general 2020-02-08 19:44:00 Cool
general 2020-02-08 19:44:23 But a motor that could change from motor 1 to motor 2 at the press of a button would be really useful
general 2020-02-08 20:16:10 Could we have a motor that would become motor 1 or 2 at the click of a button
general 2020-02-08 20:16:42 .
general 2020-02-08 20:16:52 Motor 1 is useful when im not driving the boat around
general 2020-02-08 20:16:58 for extra accuracy
general 2020-02-08 20:17:08 Motor 2 is useful for when i am friving the boat
general 2020-02-08 20:17:24 So i only use wasd instead of wasd and qerf for the turret too
general 2020-02-08 20:18:03 It is when im not driving the boat
general 2020-02-08 20:18:16 Motor 2 is harder to use but useful for when im driving it
general 2020-02-08 20:18:36 no
general 2020-02-08 20:18:47 Ok wait a second
general 2020-02-08 20:20:49 Motor 1 is useful for when my boat is stationary.Motor 2 is useful for when my boat is moving so instead of having to use wasd for the boat and qerf for the turret i just use motor 2.Im asking for a motor i could use for a turret that would change from motor 1 to 2 and vice versa at the click of a button since motor 2 is harder to aim since i need high speed motors to keep up to planes and if i increase the speed too much it becomes hard af to aim.
general 2020-02-08 20:21:00 Now go read noobs
general 2020-02-08 20:21:31 What
general 2020-02-08 20:21:36 If its faster i cant aim it
general 2020-02-08 20:21:45 I literally said the faster it is the harder it is to aim it
general 2020-02-08 20:22:00 Bruh i am not that stupid
general 2020-02-08 20:22:36 If i increase the speed and i move slightly it moves too much
general 2020-02-08 20:22:42 Optimal is 2.5
general 2020-02-08 20:23:01 Who really lacks depth of perception here
general 2020-02-08 20:23:05 No stupid
general 2020-02-08 20:23:12 Mine is too light to wobble
general 2020-02-08 20:23:45 Damn for the amout of ranks you have youre quite slow of mind
general 2020-02-08 20:23:53 But ok i guess
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 20:24:56 Motor 1 is useful for when my boat is stationary.Motor 2 is useful for when my boat is moving so instead of having to use wasd for the boat and qerf for the turret i just use motor 2.Im asking for a motor i could use for a turret that would change from motor 1 to 2 and vice versa at the click of a button since motor 2 is harder to aim since i need high speed motors to keep up to planes and if i increase the speed too much it becomes hard af to aim.
general 2020-02-08 20:25:34 Do you need a picture to figure that out
general 2020-02-08 20:25:40 The turret does not wobble at all
general 2020-02-08 20:25:42 Its light
general 2020-02-08 20:25:51 Very flexible
general 2020-02-08 20:26:13 When im not moving the boat motor 1 is the best option
general 2020-02-08 20:26:22 When i am moving motor 2 is the best option
general 2020-02-08 20:26:39 You literally asked me to explain
general 2020-02-08 20:26:53 I am setting up the parameters to explain that
general 2020-02-08 20:26:56 But youre not letting me
general 2020-02-08 20:27:04 Guess i can mute you
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 20:27:26 Epic

plane-crazy 2020-02-09 14:39:01 I know
plane-crazy 2020-02-09 14:39:20 Often happens that when my boat goes at 150 speed its more like 90 or so

general 2020-03-21 16:32:44 I use propellor blades
general 2020-03-21 16:32:53 I tried all the ways of placing them
help 2020-03-21 16:33:47 How can i make dual propellor helicopters
help 2020-03-21 16:34:12 Like the propellors used in the v 22 osprey
help 2020-03-21 16:34:34 Whenever i try to make them dual they start spinning my plane in one direction
general 2020-03-21 17:36:15 This game could really use a bug fixing and performance improovement update
general 2020-03-21 18:39:31 That
general 2020-03-21 18:39:38 Is quite a stupid plane

help 2020-03-22 21:58:22 What is a better weapon for a plane?Guns placed in front of each other to make a sort of laser when it fires or should weapons be spreaded across the plane

bot-central 2020-08-24 23:36:29 &suggest
 Gun changes 
(PvP)
  
Guns should be more configurable.
For example you should be able to chance the bullets your gun shoots mm.From 7-40mm.The more you increase it the fire rate will be slower and each shot that hits will deal more damage.
Ammo belt types: 
Armor piercing bullets: These will deal more damage to a single block it hits 
Incendiary:These would deal lower impact damage than AP bullets but would have a DoT which would give them more overall damage (Burning DoT) and they would affect a single block.They would also explode any fuel tanks they hit
Hight explosive:These would deal damage to blocks in a radius of 3x3 with higher damage on the block that was hit and lower damage on its the edge blocks.They would deal lower damage on a single block but more overall counting in the edge blocks that are also by it compared to AP bullets.These should be much better at destroying wings or should deal more damage to them than AP bullets
Tracers:Bullets that deal less damage than AP but leave a visible trace like current bullets do
There are also a lot of other
Belts:Unless its too hard to add these too it would be nice if you could customise the belts each of your guns shoots.For example:Ground targets belt:Bullet 1:AP 2:AP 3:AP 4:T
Stealth:(Used for air to air combat):1:AP 2:AP 3:I 4:HE
Air to air:1:AP 2:T 3:I 4:HE 
Belts would be fired from bullet 1 to bullet XX there being a fair limit of 10 to belt ammunition customisation
Guns should receive a damage buff as outside of having them stacked they deal very little damage making air to air combat reliant on rockets
bot-central 2020-08-24 23:36:48 um

plane-crazy 2020-09-01 11:44:23 does the move tool (button 4) work for any of you?
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:53:15 Why do so many people call parachutes in the back of your plane airbrakes
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:53:20 😐
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:53:53 Parachutes are not airbrakes please stop
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:54:34 Airbrakes are vertical or almost vertical wings generally coming out of a planes back
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:54:42 With the purpose to slow down the plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 01:55:17 Use pistons?
