help 2022-07-16 11:44:21 So one rule for getting ranks says you can‚Äôt artificially increase the block count by using blocks instead of beams etc‚Ä¶ I use blocks instead of beams, wing panel 1x1s, but not to increase the block count, it was originally to make it take less damage, is that okay?
help 2022-07-16 11:44:48 Or do I absolutely have to use beams whenever I can
help 2022-07-16 14:01:25 Whaaat? Nooo‚Ä¶

general 2022-08-27 00:37:51 thanks
general 2022-08-27 00:38:02 my bf-109 has been very good at taking out modern jets but
general 2022-08-27 00:38:13 ive noticed newer jet builds are getting better and better
general 2022-08-27 00:38:20 now my bf-109 is getting a bit outdated for its job
general 2022-08-27 00:38:48 <:fatdubs:910347504648847451>

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:07:59 damn
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:30 I mean I could help you if thats what youre asking for
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:35 but I use WW2 planes mainly
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:44 However I have a bf-109 that's good against jets
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:08:47 yeah sure
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:00 but do you know how to make like, flying wing planes?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:10 Cause I need help with one
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:18 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:20 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:33 which is why im trying to replace my bf-109
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:09:45 back when I made it most jets were around 600-1000 speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:00 so my bf-109 goes about 700 speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:20 my 109 used to dominate jets
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:44 I never lost dogfights against jets until the newer 2k speed dogfighters started being built
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:10:54 at least, with the 109 i didnt
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:11:05 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:11:27 yeah Im trying to build a new plane that can replace my bf-109
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:11:34 preferably like a WW2 jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:11:45 I have an me-262 that might start replacing it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:12:06 but its still not fast enough for SOME of the newer jets that go like 2k
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:12:20 I prefer more WW2 designs
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:13:10 Clearly we dont have to if I was able to consistently shoot down fifth generation fighters with a plane designed in the 1930s
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:14:18 Whats wrong with it?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:15:28 I care about making what I want while still making it pvp capable
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:16:26 I already said WW2.
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:17:47 I just like WW2 planes cause it was the peak era for dogfighting
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:18:07 in WW1, aircraft was too new a concept
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:18:10 and in modern day
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:18:15 we have guided missiles that just
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:18:23 dont even allow dogfights to happen
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:20:28 early guided rockets were already a thing before WW2 ended
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:46:34 Can anyone help me with how to make flying wing designs actually PvP capable?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:47:04 I tried making a wolfenstein style Ho-229 but it maneuvers terribly.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:51:39 How do I do that?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:51:54 I mainly do WW2 planes, and Ive never done thrust vectoring before.
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:55:24 Alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:55:29 Ill see if it works
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:57:34 Can you recommend any specific thrust vectoring tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:58:08 Thats what ive been doing
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:58:29 Ive gotten it to the point where it can QUESTIONABLY turn left and right
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:58:46 It looks like crap so I at least want it to do well in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:59:16 Where do I find that?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 01:59:21 Im not too active on this server.

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:06:28 and started whining
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:06:30 when the game was
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:06:32 too hard to build
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:07:09 you have to download mods for fucking multiplayer
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:09:55 PC2 is a lie made up by the government.

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:10:17 PC2 isnt real
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:11:15 PC2 was a lie made up by the US government to keep plane designers waiting for PC2 instead of starting a company so big businesses like boeing can stay on top
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:12:37 L
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:13:07 he discovered the truth about PC2
