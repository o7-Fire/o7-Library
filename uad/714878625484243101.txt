creations-chat 2022-04-29 12:12:01 rickje can't fix and debug plane crazy because of roblox. bugs which exists in pc1 and so annoying and that's the actaual reason. In this game you need something called creativity and thinking. Some people also waits for pc2

<@864602524220129321> gaining votes (especially for expert ranks and higher) needs few days due to timezones

it is due to glitches which makes playing pc impossible or difficult. If you wouldn't ever join here, you could realize that, public servers are quite nice and "friendly" (just like other roblox games), the glitches are for example: anchor or piston flings your build to the void, paints and configurations are reseting

i know, it's NOT a F4 wtf is wrong with you, none is required other than a rebuild

plus it's a CAR, not a PLANE
creations-chat 2022-05-11 20:51:52 i would call an armored car an APC, the wheels sucks, too thicc mud guards, trash color, no details (even the important ones) too wide or too short, no camo even blocky one, the hull isn't wedges in the front or even the whole hull, turrect sucks without any manhole or any mashine gun, too short barrel, no lights (front and back ones). Everything

it doesn't even looks like an car or armored vechicle, the thing resembles an ww2 german sdkfz and a russian apc

the-dump 2022-06-18 15:14:08 they do
the-dump 2022-06-18 15:14:23 but their body have bacteria or something on them
creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:20:34 front aio contains the front ports and power button, c-mos battery is the 1.5 Volt battery in the motherboard, so the power supply doesn't even power the pc because of no cables coming out of it to the compoments, the fans irl doesn't have lights put on them directly, only on the frame surronding them, the gpu isn't like that, the back have no (IMPORTANT) shields for gpu and other cards expanshions, no back ports, the fans are way different and they have more than 4 or 8 blades on each, no motherboard have ram soldered right onto it, the standard gaming pc cases have the shield, only the ones for normal pc doesn't have them, and add way more effort into making a nice looking pc. Try better next time
creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:23:54 it's an additional smaller card to put on PCI slots below the gpu, some have antennas which screws right into the card
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 15:28:40 it is i guess

the-dump 2022-06-21 09:14:26 the base colors are red, yellow and blue
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:14:56 cyan, magenta, green, white, black are mixes of at least 2 of those
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:15:05 so they aren't primary
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 09:15:10 no
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:16:12 what
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:16:22 there are only 3 primary colors
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:16:33 rest are the mix of primary colors
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:17:48 that's what i mean
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:17:53 3 primary colors
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:18:02 rest are the mix
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:18:12 i don't use secondary primary
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:18:18 or anything like that
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:19:25 black is a mix of red yellow and blue
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:19:48 with cyan and magenta other type of black will come out
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:20:15 they are the 3 base colors
the-dump 2022-06-21 09:20:33 they are the base of every other color

bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:26:52 known, just like every single bug "reported" here
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:29:46 weird physics, perhaps big build = glitches, lag, incredibly high ping. It's normal on entire roblox platform
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:30:20 but games like pc are "rare"
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:30:52 don't ask me
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:31:45 i recommend to check the entire build for pistons, motors (mostly 2), springs, suspension, etc.
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:32:05 they are the main reason why builds like to glitch and fling
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:33:42 also, rickje tried to optimize the game to fix issues with big builds
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:33:49 remove them.
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:33:54 they are the reason
bug-reports 2023-05-07 21:34:15 especially half piston
contest-chat 2023-05-09 11:27:52 <@466793357318815744> don't delay you
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 18:11:46 perhaps not locked motor or sth like that
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 18:21:48 that's most likely the reason
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 18:40:26 <:shock:1098116005252841503>
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:42:25 pc2 is fake

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:44:36 engine you want isn't real
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:44:43 all engines do that
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:49:33 you probably want to slow down over time
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:50:41 by slowly pressing the other key (i forgot what it's called)

plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:05:58 other option is removing some motors, pistons, etc.
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:33 that might be the reason
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:48 normal or half pistons?
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:06:58 mkay
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:08:11 sort of
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:08:27 anything that moves affects ping
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:09:07 by movement i mean blocks like springs, pistons and etc.

plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:18:14 maybe i was wrong, they might only retract when retract automaticly is enabled
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 14:37:07 the reason why speakers don't play audio is probably roblox taking them down

plane-crazy 2023-06-15 14:38:20 tbh, pc2 is done, but transfering builds and bugs stops
plane-crazy 2023-06-15 14:38:25 he's unable to debug it
the-dump 2023-06-15 16:19:57 to get here, you need expert designer role
the-dump 2023-06-15 16:20:20 not so easy
the-dump 2023-06-15 21:28:31 it's about doing a disgusting thing with your body (not the s word)
bug-reports 2023-06-16 07:23:03 the thing is: you don't

plane-crazy 2023-06-16 16:50:28 mostly crate
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:30:24 piss color
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:53:44 super rocket engines. A lot. Or you can use hover engine or conveyor engine (not recommended for builds like ships or submarines)
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:41:51 you shouldn't
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:41:55 they love to fling ships
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:43:17 rocket engines
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 13:31:09 <@573970670854340628> looks suspicious
bug-reports 2023-06-18 16:01:41 <@866848584888877077> hello, another one
bug-reports 2023-06-18 16:21:09 prob
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:40:08 wha
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:45:30 you'd better read rules
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:46:26 just like other new members, you decide to break rules, but you didn't knew that because you never looked there
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:46:49 how about this: read rules, don't try to break them and everything will be fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:48:21 make better what
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:48:28 i saw nothing
the-dump 2023-06-18 16:50:13 <@866848584888877077> uhhh, i don't think it's allowed (obvious joke, but still)
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:50:35 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:52:26 he mean something like a vechicle smashed a fx. zombie which leaves blood on the point where it was hit
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:52:43 but it's a thing to mostly cars
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:39:01 helium or ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:40:56 i think i know why, mass isn't equal on all sides
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:41:26 mass sort of matters on no gravity
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:42:10 was the middle piece supposed to be connected to only one side?
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:42:29 that sort of explains
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:43:15 because there's only one connection, build tilts because of center of mass not being in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:43:29 idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:48:07 same thing, weight isn't distributed correctly
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:48:28 helium and/or ballast blocks should fix it
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:49:39 try making them out of blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:50:14 not really
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:50:42 because they aren't 100% round, they can bounce a bit
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:50:59 which may or may not help with off- road ride
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:51:25 they bounce a tiny bit
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:51:41 it shouldn't decrease performance
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:51:55 flipping is not an option
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:51:56 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 21:52:06 it's a necessarity

the-dump 2023-06-19 13:03:50 in my country, if you don't have a car, then you are one of the worst people
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:04:08 you can't really go anywhere without it
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:04:23 there are buses, but they cost
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:06:06 Is it The Czech Republic?
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:06:17 ah
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:06:39 i can sort of understand the language
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:06:58 that's they reason for my guess
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:07:40 same thing in my country
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:07:47 but mostly for school
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:08:58 that's a lot
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:09:34 yes
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:09:58 i see
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:10:15 another thing to consider is ticket cost
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:10:31 free?
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:10:53 i have to eighter pay or get a card which last only a month
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:11:13 when a specific month ends, i have to buy it again
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:11:19 they aren't cheap
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:11:38 i don't
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:12:04 "lucky"
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:12:19 i have to pay mostly
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:12:36 i actually never bough a monthly ticket
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:12:40 so...
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:13:22 in mine, expensive
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:13:33 probably better country
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:15:14 i have that thing
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:16:28 seems reasonable
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:16:43 oh

the-dump 2023-06-19 13:19:06 you want to know a bad thing about living in the US?
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:19:21 no
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:19:41 most people that lives in us are basicly dumb for a reason
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:20:00 to study after primary school, you have to pay a lot
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:20:17 like, few thousand dollars
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:20:22 same
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:20:51 i don't have that thing, so i'm good
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:21:01 not US citizen 😎
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:21:30 in mine country, it's reverse
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:21:39 but the difference is "small"
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:22:40 huh?
the-dump 2023-06-19 13:22:58 they are dumb, but they know a lot about military at the same time?

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 11:43:49 wow
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 14:06:47 blocky
the-dump 2023-06-27 14:11:13 i can confirm
the-dump 2023-06-27 14:11:27 because i saw all of it before
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:03:00 but antifurries have a reasonable reason to hate
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:04:01 while furries are hating antifurs mostly because antifurs attack them with good arguments are reasonings
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:04:23 furries do that for literally no reason
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:08:08 they want to do that because they have a reason to
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:08:24 which leads all the way to medival times
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:09:37 they are technically animals. Animals had no rights back then, so people were doing anything they want with them
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:09:50 common thing was hunting
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:11 it doesn't change anything
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:24 i'm not gonna argue with you
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:36 furries are disgusting
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:45 mostly because they are based on nsfw
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:10:52 nsfw isn't good
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:11:04 experience
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:11:17 cry all you want
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:11:32 i don't give a damn
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:11:56 i used to "live" among them
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:12:08 and that's what was common there
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:12:37 not every single one does that, but still
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:14:04 <:empty:794431705070174238>
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:15:05 another problem is, it's not easy to recognize if a furry does nsfw stuff
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:15:37 people don't want to waste thousand of hours checking if every single furry does that
the-dump 2023-06-27 19:15:43 it's a waste of time

plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:26:36 there's space for it
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:26:51 take a look
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:27:22 that's enough
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:27:55 motolock towers are one block tall + 2 half slabs to cover it
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:28:07 when locked
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:28:24 there's also space in the back
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:28:52 also, adding simple motorlock to a build doesn't make it cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:29:02 not so simple
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:30:06 why camera
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 12:30:11 use small propeller engines

plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:18:16 i learned angle locks all by myself
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:18:21 similiar thing with motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:19:03 i know
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:53 or spings
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:20:58 but they are messy
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:21:46 disconnectors takes more space
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:21:53 so springs are the best for me
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:22:11 maybe tnts but i haven't tested it on normal server
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:44:13 still blocky
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:06 it won't
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:18 cutter hitboxes are weird
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 16:14:27 remember that you can customize how much does the ballast block weights with config tool
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 16:15:40 remember that unconfigured ballast block/beam weights the same as normal block/beam
