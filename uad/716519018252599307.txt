general 2021-11-14 05:15:08 For me angle lock is the most finnicky thing that i have ever learned
general 2021-11-14 05:15:25 Since u cant make a working angle lock with servo motor 2
general 2021-11-14 05:15:44 I actually used it a bunch of times
general 2021-11-14 05:16:17 Its pretty useful if they made it SO THE MOTOR 2S WILL WORK
general 2021-11-14 05:16:27 AS ANGLE LOCK
general 2021-11-14 05:17:02 Cuz servo motors will be useful to motor lock
general 2021-11-14 05:17:08 IF THEY ACTUALLY WORK
general 2021-11-14 05:17:46 Angle locking wont work if u use the motor 2 in servo to angle a thing
general 2021-11-14 05:18:03 Ye
