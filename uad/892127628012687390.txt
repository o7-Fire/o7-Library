creations-chat 2023-06-27 00:26:15 nobody with integrity would steal two diffent builds one two post and one to provide "proof"
creations-chat 2023-06-27 00:28:17 its edited fake and stolen a triple whammy
creations-chat 2023-06-27 00:35:59 <@679134797964247062> add a ballast block to balance the sub more in the back its slowly tilting forward and you'll have to get the calibrations right for it to work
creations-chat 2023-06-27 00:50:06 if you are using water propellers to move the tilting side up thats not what i mean if you did not move at all in the water with no imputes and your sub starts to tilt one way or the other you have a balance issue and need to add a ballast block to solve the problem.
creations-chat 2023-06-27 00:56:34 its fake stolen and edited scroll up
creations-chat 2023-06-27 01:17:09 those are very different look at the tips at the very back compered to the other guys very different
