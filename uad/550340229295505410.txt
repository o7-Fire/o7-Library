general 2022-07-13 16:04:16 there should be an arresting wire block and tailhook in the game to go along with it. Think of the wire almost like the rope block. The tailhook could extend and retract like landing gears
general 2022-07-13 16:08:37 oh, okay *hacks the game and adds a custom block*
general 2022-07-13 16:10:00 yes, but it would be nice for people that can't build more advanced things.
general 2022-07-13 16:10:12 Not saying I can't, im actually pretty damn good at building.
general 2022-07-13 16:14:19 I've slowly realized that most of Plane Crazy's community (and to an extent, Roblox), is made of 93% people under the age of 12
