help 2023-07-08 02:47:22 not really for a specific creation, but are there any really small gyro designs? I'm trying to make small airships, but they start tipping over by just walking to one end or another. helium/ballasts only barely help.
general 2023-07-08 03:27:57 i regret verifying on this server
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 03:48:36 today i learned that 1x4 and 1x7 blocks weigh more than 4 or 7 regular blocks
help 2023-07-08 20:56:09 anything i could use to transition between these two blocks?
help 2023-07-08 20:56:30 alternatively between these two
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 21:52:16 its giving me the tutorial again
creations-chat 2023-07-10 06:13:54 aw man i was gonna post a creation i was proud of (it was absolutely going to get downvoted) but i cannot post images
help 2023-07-10 21:58:52 are there any solutions/replacements for adding ladders (or a fence of some kind) to these curves
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 08:57:08 Absolutely true
general 2023-07-14 08:57:57 Why is this discord so blatantly racist
general 2023-07-14 08:58:13 Or well, a lot of discords in general
general 2023-07-14 08:58:40 Judging someone based on color
general 2023-07-14 08:59:13 Who's
general 2023-07-14 09:00:06 It is racist because people here treat others as inferior based on the color of their name
general 2023-07-14 09:00:13 What part of that isn't racist?
general 2023-07-14 09:00:43 So?
general 2023-07-14 09:04:12 I know
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:12:11 its been a while since i got the HRUBUBUBUB engines
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:12:24 the thing im using has constantly running engines
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:12:27 and it is rather funny
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:15:34 its called an aerodynamic jaw
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:16:11 it looks like those people who have barely any lower jaw
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:16:17 which is in fact more aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 02:21:53 noted.
