plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:03:30 I got a dude to help me see if shit can land on it but he can't slow down lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:03:49 He's using the basic plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:04:12 Oh my god he is failing so miserably
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:04:15 And he's right there too
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:04:55 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:05:07 From what I've seen he's good with land and naval
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:05:20 I put about 700 blocks on this thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:05:35 It's not the most visually pleasing thing on land but it's nice on water
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:05:46 The big ass propellers
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:07:00 I have a pretty good helicopter build but steering it is a pain
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:07:43 I would love to see vehicle tracks in the game
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:08:15 I wanna build a legit tank

plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:35:33 So I'm building the USS (almost) Langley
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:35:47 But it starts tilting when it goes forward
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:36:25 So I try to invert the propellers and the whole boat tilts
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:36:43 And then it tips over
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 13:37:02 And there I am swimming on the water wondering why I can't design

plane-crazy 2018-12-05 16:04:56 Ahh the good times when I didn't have to be alive
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 09:08:04 Scientific fact: If you took all the veins from your body and laid them end to end, you would die.
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 09:08:28 Friends are like bananas. If you peel their skin and eat them, they die.
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 09:08:36 Roses are dead. 

Violets are dead. 

I am a bad gardener.
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 09:08:47 I've got 99 problems and one of them is that I count my problems instead of solving them.
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 09:09:03 If life gives you melons, you are dyslexic.
