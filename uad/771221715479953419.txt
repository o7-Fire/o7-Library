plane-crazy 2022-07-01 02:12:55 "And a second wrote: ‚ÄúI would much rather prefer a nuclear airship, as the space available will be far greater, but nevertheless, the creativity behind the idea is wonderful and I hope the planners get somewhere someday.‚Äù

While many have their hopes set high for the giant hotel, the Sky Cruise is still far in the future.

Even if an aircraft like this is built one day, there are some things that can never change."

creations-chat 2023-02-26 19:02:30 what you *can* do in order to get the color right is to use a color picker so you know what the color is from a picture that you used
Heres the one i use:
https://imagecolorpicker.com/en
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:29:39 its high because of the way i took the screenshot.
I have exposed motorlock because there are some places where it didnt fit without being hidden. So the motors that are sticking out are camoflogued to either look ike a part of the helicopter or as exposed parts like vents or bolts
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:32:06 I couldnt tell if you meant "how do you have exposed lcok on it too" as either a question or you were just saying it sarcastically. 
If you really are trying to say "sounds like a skill issue" then you're really bad at hearing.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:34:23 how about when you read them? Do you not have a little voice in your head reading off every message you see? <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:36:30 it is in your head. Thats how thoughts work <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
Second message: I dont think your gaslighting is working because you had to ask **me** in order to get the argument going. I can use this as a good example right now, you have a skill issue for gaslighting. If you decide to use my own argument against me, you will also fail at that task because my argument (in the terms of an article) only talks about you being bad at gaslighting and if you use my own argument against me. If you ignore my message, its because you know you lost the argument and cannot reply back because you will simply put more shame on yourself. If you say "well why are you ranting, arent you the angry one now?", I am not ranting, im just giving a clear explanation on why you are a complete wuss at trying to gaslight. May you live in embarrassment
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:45:30 arent you gonna reply to my message on you trying to gaslight me? uwu
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:48:56 bruh, the tip of the vertical stabilizer reaches up to the main support for the rotor. <@567763933952475157> its a helicopter
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:54:17 Oh you mean that purple thing. I think someones trying to make their own super saiyen
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:58:31 ‚ö†Ô∏è Just saying (and strictly professional)‚ö†Ô∏è 
If you meant my helicopter, you need to freshen up on what the tail on the UH-1H looks like. I know that the actual beam needs to be angled up more but thats too much work and i wanna work on something else because im really burnt out from working on it for the past like 3 days.
Edit: Actually i might angle it because i got nothing else to do
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:00:35 oh crap, thats the new model of blueprints
Edit: ok i just looked up the actual UH-1H blueprints and it doesnt have a tail thats angled *as much*
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:07:09 There are 2 different model types. I classify them by war generation but it probably has been organized in a more professional manner. So the "vietnam war" models and there are the "coldwar-present" models. The vietnam models have a rounder nose and the coldwar-present models have a sharper looking nose. The most common of the sharper nosed Hueys is the TH-1H. The model in the blueprints i sent have a sharper nose, thus making them a "coldwar-present" model. Im typing a lot becaues im trying to make the most of what i send because of the slowmode. Now in the picture attatched to this thread is the actual UH-1H blueprints
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:11:52 dude, you just sent 3 different models of the UH-1 Huey. You sent the UH-1B (the one with the small door), the UH-1Y (the one with the extra large jet engine funnel), and the finally the UH-1H (the one with the two windows on the doors with the "normal" jet engine.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:17:18 well theres a difference between being bad and being a classified model. Also, plane crazy has its limitations
<@438492646311329794>
Well yea because i already built it you idiot. Youre mentioning things i already did. Go back into your hole and never return and resist the urge to make you feel like you need to be a part of an argument because you want the feeling of "drama" in your life
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:20:11 Then on your terms, at least i can create the foundations to nations than rather be that one guy who steps into the cement when its flat
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:24:16 listen, *you* are saying that *my* tail that *I* built is not related to *me building* it
<@375281006091173890> so im a new discovery? If i am a new discovery on your terms, then that means that i can do whatever i want bceause nobody knows what my past was.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:28:23 <@940394796558717031> So about your gravedigger...
the layers of paint on the actual gravedigger (from bottom to top) goes to green, purple, then black. The paint scheme on yours is green, black, purple so it makes the whole thing really bright colored because the roof makes up most of the vehicle. Now you obviously cant make the skull, but you could at least improve on these specific things
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:32:22 then whats a "new atom" because im just a freshman
<@438492646311329794>
"You building it has nothing to do with the fact that your tail looks nothing like the tail of any variants" It doesnt like the tail in the picture because i *built*
<@567763933952475157> 
Stay in *our* conversation and stay out of my other conversations
<@940394796558717031> Also i forgot to mention, dont use the colors on the color table because they might be too bright for your gravedigger. Use custom colors or use a color picker. https://imagecolorpicker.com/en
Also dont make the suspension and eveything neon green bceause theyre black and grey on the actual gravedigger
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:35:39 ok read, he probably started plane crazy like a month or two ago and isint that good at the game yet. We all have been in the same place when we all started plane crazy, we were all ass.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 22:38:09 then why do you keep replying to me ü§ì
