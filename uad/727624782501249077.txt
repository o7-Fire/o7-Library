<@!527653676022628353> so if my build was as horrible as it is what can i do to improve it? or should i just keep playing ptfs in this case because my 727x717 is just some beams with engines slapped onto them because i have not half an idea on how to use wedges

creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:06:20 now i must try to not make people want to bleach their eyes
creations-chat 2020-09-30 23:43:42 idk if some of you guys are still here but i managed to improve the dash 9's front end to look less boxy and more like a plane. Some may still need eye bleach. I also managed to figure out a somewhat messy way to hide the landing gear inside the fuselage by using trapdoors. It looks wierd but it works in the end.

bug-reports 2020-10-02 19:09:48 i found something new, sometimes if you load a save some parts are gonna be randomly misplaced, deleted, or sometimes even random blocks scattered all over your build. I have no idea how such a random glitch can happen.
