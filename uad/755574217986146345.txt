general 2022-12-03 17:49:05 question: how do i report bugs?
general 2022-12-03 17:49:53 oh wait
general 2022-12-03 17:49:54 nvmd
bug-reports 2022-12-03 17:51:01 i'm having that same issue too, any idea how to fix it?
bug-reports 2022-12-04 16:04:11 tried it, and it's still stuck on the ui
bug-reports 2022-12-04 16:20:53 do i have to be on something specific then push esc?
bug-reports 2022-12-04 16:21:32 because per the usual it takes me to that menu
bug-reports 2022-12-04 16:38:22 unfortunately that’s the only solution I know of
bug-reports 2022-12-04 16:38:47 I should probably shut down my computer, reboot it up again and see how it goes
bug-reports 2022-12-04 18:20:13 oh yeah, I use that when I’m making motor locks
bug-reports 2022-12-04 19:54:44 thank you!
