creations-chat 2020-06-21 02:22:52 Well you could try building simple planes as a start
creations-chat 2020-06-21 02:23:20 Indeed

creations-chat 2020-07-17 07:51:54 then some random kid says he’s a better builder than I am and yet he’s building a tutor m1a2 abrams suspension system.

creations-chat 2020-07-17 07:53:28 I use only cylinder for the barrels since there are no actual gun types other than pvp weapons.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 07:54:33 I messed around with the mechanics and made a bomber.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 07:55:18 There shouldn’t be a trading system, there’ll be scammers EVERYWHERE begging for people to give them free stuff or the scammer would report abuse.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 07:57:04 Wow, thanks for telling me to shut up.

plane-crazy 2020-07-21 03:07:41 I believe he is gonna end up on R/iamaidiot
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:41:15 Are people done trolling the <#384025409945337856> or what?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:42:10 Someone tell me, why is there a very bad version of the mass?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:42:14 Maus*
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:42:29 <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:42:52 It was created by ushanka boi or boy
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:43:33 Gun is too long
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:43:37 it’s not 200mm
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:44:30 Wow, chill out, I’m just doing criticism on what seems off to me.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:44:54 Yeah because the game is still being updated.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:45:19 Bruh.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:45:23 We know.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:46:05 But it’s better to use measurement or people might end up breaking their own creation.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:48:06 If you don’t like my criticism so then why complain? If you seriously think that maus is good, then take a another glance, then go build your Stürm Tïger.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:48:39 The barrel should be cut off by 3 cylinders.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:48:56 Is it offensive?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:49:38 Lmao, I was right about that maus, like it’s ugly and it’s not up to the real thing.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:50:21 Terrible Detail, too long of a gun, shave off 3-4 cylinders.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:50:37 Turret looks like a can of spam made into a mini tank.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:52:06 The body of that maus looks like a fuggin Cheese wedge poked with holes in the bottom to make room for wheels, I’ve never seen such a uglier tank.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:52:33 NOW, the wheels.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:54:45 Oh wait wheels are fine, it’s the fuggin ladders randomly placed on the Top of the maus body that look like cheese shredders at that angle, like seriously where’s the Lil bits like the look out port in the front top of the turret and where the hell is the friggin Storage barrel on the back of it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:55:44 I swear the ladders on that maus look like cheese shredders, <@!347182144873037824> it’s called criticism bud.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:56:20 Criticism is MEANT to help people improve but since you think it’s ranting, then you are very much wrong.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:58:06 Looks like a stick man given a M4, then his body got starved halfway to death, his eyes are fine, and the gun. but his body is so thin he could end up getting crushed by a ||fuggin|| crate.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:58:31 Never again.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:59:03 I like the antanomy of it, but it needs some More T H I C C
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 06:59:36 Nice mini islands.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:01:24 Gamer it’s not fake, it’s real.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:01:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:01:48 Thanks for the disclaimer
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:04:51 Is that a vampire?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:23:23 Yeah Greatadventure is right, I saw what happened, he showed me the proof.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:23:56 I literally DONT see any kind of NSFW in the meme he sent in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:24:47 Meme was just pretty much a Frozen 2 scene with red spy using the Icicle knife, I don’t see how that’s NSFW.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:25:53 You can look, but I’m sure the warn is gone. Prob mods deleted the warn.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:26:54 Yeah, this seems very off.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:27:15 Like a mod doesn’t randomly warn you for a non NSFW meme.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:27:31 Yeah that’s my point, they don’t.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:27:45 Good question, where really did the reason go to?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:28:53 I don’t think he did, if he did, he would’ve been banned on sight. I’m pretty sure it’s a bannable offense ranging on how much NSFW there is posted.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:29:08 Yes please.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:29:15 or we could make a group dm
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:29:33 Because a mods prob gonna see this and get mad at- ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:29:37 <#497142796961054721>
general 2020-07-21 07:30:58 I seriously cannot believe a mod would warn for non NSFW.
general 2020-07-21 07:31:18 wait, did you post something nsfw in the past? <@!585513259822743553>
general 2020-07-21 07:31:27 or offensive? Alright.
general 2020-07-21 07:31:52 <@723419054114865202> I don’t think mods would just warn on accident.
general 2020-07-21 07:32:02 Like it feels suspicious to me and very off.
general 2020-07-21 07:32:40 <@456226577798135808> Was it before or after the meme?
general 2020-07-21 07:33:07 What time did it happen?
general 2020-07-21 07:33:11 And what day?
general 2020-07-21 07:33:36 I’m gonna assume long ago is either a year ago or a couple months
general 2020-07-21 07:35:14 Yeah it better be a misclick, because if the warn was on purpose that can lead to serious punishment from higher ups.
general 2020-07-21 07:36:22 People really should hand pick someone who’s trusted enough and has been on for a longer period of time, most mod abuse occurs because some choose untrusted users for a mod.
general 2020-07-21 07:37:18 yeah dm him and he might look into it.
general 2020-07-21 07:37:28 I just hope this doesn’t end up as drama.
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:38:47 Are those mini F-4Us?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 07:38:54 Corsair class?

general 2020-07-21 07:41:57 Wait what?
general 2020-07-21 07:42:00 The meme?
general 2020-07-21 07:42:50 <@456226577798135808> very funny lmao, and yes Xbox is crappie.

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:03:09 Not all of them.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:04:24 I’m surprised 2 two people disliked my creation in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:04:43 Indeed
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:04:49 Some will just straight up copy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:04:55 and it’s annoyingly difficult to find out if their creation is legitimate or not.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:05:50 I used to be pc
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:06:12 But I switched
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:06:59 Yeah im one of those good mobile builders but I’m not gonna brag about my skills, because bragging to some people will piss em off.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:07:11 Or just jealous? Idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:08:15 Why would two people dislike
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:08:23 my creation in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:08:40 I don’t get why they would, it’s not like it’s THAT  BAD.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:08:51 Like they gotta have a good reason smh
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:13:41 Oh boy, a mod dislikes it.
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:13:44 hooray..

general 2020-07-22 05:26:47 Someone tell me, how do you tell if a user is underaged?
general 2020-07-22 05:27:16 like any phrase of: “lol ur triggered” or something like it.

general 2020-07-22 05:39:02 **P I S S** that’s all I’m gonna say.
general 2020-07-22 05:39:29 Actually piss is just water with bacteria.
general 2020-07-22 05:39:47 no :>
general 2020-07-22 05:41:18 therefore, piss isn’t considered nsfw and the plus side is that you can drink it in a middle of a desert. You won’t die, but you will feel very unwell after drinking it. This is science.
general 2020-07-22 05:42:05 There is a movie where some kids from a refugee camp had to drink their piss because they had no water sadly.
general 2020-07-22 05:42:27 I am not in a desert, so therefore drinking piss isn’t required for me.
general 2020-07-22 05:44:10 <:what:644996672048463942>

creations-chat 2020-07-24 07:23:10 SUPER ROCKETS are MEANT to make you go over 500 KM/H but since the physics and coding is off by a lot, the weight of the vehicle makes it go slower.

creations-chat 2020-07-24 07:24:14 not really
creations-chat 2020-07-24 07:24:29 the conveyer is effected by the weight of the jet.

general 2020-08-06 23:34:28 <@!339519624968404993> My suggestion: Tell the kid to not ping ricke and that he would lose the friendship if he did ping. Hopefully it’ll convince him
general 2020-08-06 23:35:42 <@!339519624968404993> If he isn’t listening then it’s because he most likely lost trust in his parents or something else.
general 2020-08-06 23:36:43 I’m not entirely sure what’s going on in his life but I think we should investigate to see how bad of a job the parents are doing or what...

Also, The back where the tail is, the rear elevators never bended  like that, the whole elevator never did. The bend in the wings is wrong, the bend starts at least 1/3rd of the way or less.

general 2020-08-11 22:46:53 No, I’m not disappointed..?

general 2020-08-11 22:47:40 <:pogey:651848693842182144>

general 2020-08-11 22:53:18 Those aren’t BLOCKS.
creations-chat 2020-08-11 22:53:34 That’s side armor panels.
general 2020-08-11 22:53:51 It’s thicc on the turret because I liked the design, plus crew protection
creations-chat 2020-08-11 22:54:38 Dude, I just showed you it.
creations-chat 2020-08-11 22:56:43 Look, I already told you before, the turret was designed to the way I liked it plus not only that it’s also because of armor, one side was too thin and I tested it in pvp, therefore it explains why the tank has a chunky turret
general 2020-08-11 22:57:30 You’re telling me it has no armor yet that’s spaced armor right?
general 2020-08-11 22:59:00 Look, I’ve already explained the tank before, if you seriously don’t think it’s good in pvp then that’s YOUR opinion..
general 2020-08-11 22:59:31 How do you know? You didn’t build it.
general 2020-08-11 23:00:00 I wasn’t even planning on using it for anything,
general 2020-08-11 23:00:07 Other than driving and testing.

bug-reports 2021-02-26 01:59:27 how to fix a inverted control surface when it’s not supposed to be inverted controls?
bug-reports 2021-02-26 01:59:58 but it’s the pain and suffering for having mobile controls
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:00:04 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:00:24 why does it still invert even after I use the joystick
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:00:31 curious on how this happens
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:01:20 literally minding my own business until the joy stick wanted to fuck up, and make controls invert, 
I’ve dealt with it when I tried to make a plane before.
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:01:38 Tail works normally, front doesnt.
general 2021-02-26 02:02:00 I’m getting RGB keyboard soon
general 2021-02-26 02:02:36 question: is it normal on mobile devices for frontal control surfaces to invert?
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:02:44 yeah..
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:03:39 I think I could keybind and then un-keybind it
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:03:48 maybe that might work?
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:03:54 but I can see why it’s annoying
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:04:42 the festering little bug that cause massive issues especially in terms of wings, I couldn’t imagine someone being more upset about their massive creation having a problem with wings.
bug-reports 2021-02-26 02:04:48 Thanks

plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:49:34 that’s a really bad bug that needs fixing.
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:51:11 controls glitched, they like to go down on the front wing parts, up for the rear tail
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:51:46 just regular
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:52:01 I didn’t bother setting the controls but they like to do that.. apparently now.
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:52:20 how tf do I fix a bug without having this happening
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 03:52:40 I haven’t felt this annoyed in years <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>

general 2021-03-06 16:56:07 Yeah, there was a female mod who abused her powers and falsely banned users.
general 2021-03-06 16:56:22 Before
general 2021-03-06 16:57:14 If I’m not mistaken, my good sirs, I believe Roblox needs a redo over in terms of security, with multiple firewalls being added so people cannot easily access accounts.
general 2021-03-06 16:59:12 Online daters or most call them; “Oders” which have become more money making for ROBLOX itself, but it also has ruined lives. and there are people out there who are disgusting as fuck.

general 2021-03-06 17:00:37 it’s funny how Roblox hired a mod from overseas, who got bribed for $500 USD, seriously, that’s a bad flaw on ROBLOXs’ end.

You can hear the bombers roaring over ahead. They continue to make a dramatic and very deep impact of sound from above, as the Russians can be heard nearby from their IS-2 engines and their army making way into the city.. 



You’re left with one choice, either go into the Soviet side and suffer for a long time.. 
or pick the American forces and be arrested and put on trial.**

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:21:48 Because the U.S used to outfit- yes sorry
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:21:52 I stayed up until 3 am

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:26:11 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:26:20 Hmmm.
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:26:27 I mean.

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:29:50 <:RickoMode:602011035003519006>
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:30:07 I’m gonna probably have to measure the size before I build it though.
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:33:52 did it break?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:34:15 Bro, you really need to get a new one, otherwise it’s gonna be messed up
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:00 Okay so I converted the size of 680 ft (210 m) to studs and it got me 25,908 studs
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:14 wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:16 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:26 Mk
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:41 Also the uh scale is 1:1
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:39:51 but the problem is
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:40:01 the plots are like 50x50 right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:40:32 To be honest,
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:40:38 I’m gonna probably have to Resize the length
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:40:45 resize*
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:41:27 I’m using lego converter because there’s no converter for Roblox studs
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:41:38 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:07 So then I’d have to recalculate
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:11 alright hold on
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:22 I was thinking of that
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:32 nah.
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:42:58 I wanna at least make sure it’s big enough to look good cause the motorlock isn’t the funnest
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:43:22 How about 2 or 3 left to right folds?

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:46:08 I’m copying the numbers inside my head by repeating it a couple of times then I process the solution for it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:46:21 because brain cells
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:50:06 2.78044444444 is what I got (actually 250.24)
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:52:35 It’s the answer from 680 x .92 divided by 2.5
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 21:52:43 bro go into <#498473314445033472>

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 22:02:41 Okay so the calculation was wrong, actually was 250.24 not 2.780 I must’ve somehow messed up the question
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 22:03:24 the length
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 22:03:26 yeah*
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 22:03:42 fucks sake I’m dumb.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 02:36:37 It’s a possibility but I’m not going to instantly jump to conclusions or accuse unless I have a reason to but I don’t, any who. But again like I said.. it’s a possibility that he did.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 05:33:31 Damn bro didn’t realize you were super into being a toxic kiddo, how old are you bro? and stop bitching over the fact you broke a rule.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 05:39:54 14 year olds are usually more mature but then some of them either have very short attention span or just act like a 8 year old who thinks he’s funny, being 16 I can confirm i’ve seen it before, no offense egg

I’m starting to get sick of people who make shitty builds and then make excuses saying that the build was somehow “better” than most, it’s annoying seeing kids do that

general 2021-06-21 06:25:49 REAL?!?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:27:38 I got a school aide slapped with being banned from each school in the same district because she pinched me and the teacher reported the aide for doing so, so it resulted in karma. I didn’t forgive the aide after that because I refuse to give mercy to someone who hurts me physically, boom done. 

Basically put, she got screwed over for pinching a minor
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:28:01 like she basically pinched my right arm
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:28:08 pulled a fucking vein out of place
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:28:52 I can see the vein, light blue color and it’s like close to my skin from the inside
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:29:27 like I don’t even give a shit because I heal faster usually
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:31:00 I didn’t, I got pissed and then cried so it caused more of a scene, I didn’t wanna get in trouble for hitting her, this was in intermediate mind you, so i was like 9-10 when that happened
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:31:29 The teacher reported the school aide to the board then that sent the aide to being banned in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:32:16 the old school aide kept saying shit like “I’ll give you a knuckle sandwich” which I didn’t understand at that time lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:32:26 to clear things up, it wasn’t the teacher, it was the aide.
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 06:33:16 I’m literally closer to being 6’2 now

general 2021-07-29 18:11:02 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 23:59:04 wait, which one is worser?
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 23:59:06 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 23:59:52 Idk man
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:01:42 Madvulpen jet is kinda bad ngl, no offense but that is what I have criticized, a piston for a cockpit seems kinda questionable unless it’s for a reason
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:02:45 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:02:53 sometimes it is and isn’t
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:02:56 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:03:05 it just depends on how you set it up
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:11:22 alright sorry for typing so long lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:11:41 just Had Wrote a entire paragraph of my criticism
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:12:14 Here’s serveral things I noticed that were wrong with vulpens jet: 
The wheels are obviously not well detailed, just half cylinder 2’s used with the half wedge or the text blocks used for supporting the half cylinders.

Nose is somewhat low effort, obviously just a nose with a motorlocked trail piece sticking out the front which is usually pretty common for most jets with pyramid noses, and the sides of it aren’t even rounded which makes it look kinda strikingly obviously bad in some way.

The starting points of the wings have un-smooth surfaces near the cockpit (look to middle corner), and the cockpit itself is obviously not in great detail, no offense but the cockpit needs replacement otherwise it’s gonna stick out like a thorn.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:13:27 You need to rank up to do that
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:13:38 level 3 or 5 if I’m not wrong
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:13:53 Uh, no thanks. Sorry it goes against rules.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:14:22 Sorry but I said no thanks, check rules and ask mods first.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:15:13 It obviously is bad lol, it’s too rough and somewhat low effort.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:16:10 Not really.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:16:48 I’d say dry over vulpen no offense but it’s defined on drys SU-57
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:20:29 .5 difference but one is more compact and less costly on the weight & speed.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:21:50 Doesn’t matter how small it is usually, it can change a lot of detail if it’s good and what not.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:22:01 also the noses can be easily fixed
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:22:13 Unless if it’s complex
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:22:38 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:22:42 I have a better idea

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 05:02:43 Oh, I must’ve got them confused I guess.
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 05:05:17 Oh yeah that’s right, but still I must’ve mixed them up with each other since both are look-alikes, and The French battleship Dunkerque was sunk by the french themselves as to prevent naughty German man from obtaining it as a new toy.
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 05:09:02 Good luck on making any carriers, sketchfab had them removed or somebody did because I have a fucking unfinished hull now sitting in my save files, wasting time because I can’t find very good examples to build off from

general 2021-08-20 03:46:28 I wonder if having the ability to crash into the ground on the new gen would somewhat give a realistic feel when your plane or space ship crashes into it.
general 2021-08-20 03:47:29 Yes lag, but it should be to gable so it doesn’t causes massive problems and you can only press it every 10 minutes, to prevent massive lag, a maximum of 3 people can use it at once.
general 2021-08-20 03:50:32 Rick, when you release the Next gen version of Plane Crazy will there be things like more massive plots, how will you combat the problems of having spawn plots overlapping each other?

general 2021-08-21 00:55:18 hey want to see my paragraph
general 2021-08-21 00:55:20 lol
general 2021-08-21 00:56:30 I’ve played Minecraft since 2009, I remembered when red brick pyramids were still a thing and the ‘steves’ used to have a bit of a rag-dolling limb animation when they walked + jumped, some of the parody versions of Minecraft have some old and newer tastes. But as far as I remember, you didn’t used to have graphics on high end but on older square shading before they implemented the new shade packs.

PS3 came out in 2013 and that’s where I became a much more known player, There used to be tons of people about around average of 15-19 players playing per 2-9 servers, I saw about 7 of my friends playing it a lot until Console edition Died down recently a couple years ago, 1 or 2 years ago was the final update for old gen Minecraft, they released it then they quit making updates for Old gen for good. I can also say I witnessed a lot of updates including the 1.32 or during the time from 1.45 to 1.79.

There was also a bug in 2013 where you could easily duplicate any block with a crafting table, I forgot the method since it’d been so long, the glitch was patched and people found new better ways to dupe since then, the last achievement I ever got was before leaving PS3 was “Achievement get: Diamonds for you!”

creations-chat 2021-09-16 23:24:15 <@!740668635768422490> shit creation, I hate it. <:empty:794431705070174238> <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-09-16 23:28:04 Also if you wonder why I put a down vote it’s because it’s so what low effort and you really should’ve went for adding more detail and making it bigger, with much higher quality build time alone.
creations-chat 2021-09-16 23:31:04 at least give the car headlights <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-09-17 11:01:41 he has stolen things
creations-chat 2021-09-17 20:30:10 Nah you should do both of improvements and remaking it, you could give it a bulbous bow front and have the upper bow stick out further, I’d recommend looking at some ships like maersk ships or the Seawise Giant
creations-chat 2021-09-18 02:33:43 <@!842510926996439051> Your adf is okay but the problem is that the ADF never really used bombs, unless those are missiles
creations-chat 2021-09-18 11:36:55 It’s been locked due to some funny idiots doing the no no and abusing the living crap out of creations, causing to be invisible at the moment until the mods say we can use it again thanks to knuckleheads who broke the bot who kept it image only, I fucking hate whoever broke it <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
creations-chat 2021-09-18 11:39:35 Yeah that’s pretty much what happened, either it was raider or little gremlin trolls who had nothing better to do all day except ruin the privilege of having creations open, I’m so angry <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-09-18 11:41:00 please tell me you’re joking, I don’t know if this is entirely a satire thing or just something else

creations-chat 2021-09-20 12:45:42 He’s just wanting to show the progress to us unless its about something else, I don’t know whats going on but I like the Nashorn very much.
creations-chat 2021-09-21 02:27:53 nothing sadder than forgetting to save your creation after then you hop on the next morning to find it gone, without a reason or doubt as to why. <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-09-21 02:44:54 This only happened to a low effort crap build I made in like 15 minutes, so thank god I didn’t forget saving one of my 2k+ block builds lol

creations-chat 2021-10-02 21:35:19 I get that but like dude. Did you not read rules?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 01:31:02 Not really, think about it like you wanna contribute to 9/11/2001 without offending people, the reason why they have this rule for not allowing 9/11 towers is because some people aren’t being very appropriate with it, i don’t honestly know but you can go ask yousuf or someone else about it, end of conversation because I don’t like talking about this
creations-chat 2021-10-03 01:34:04 kinda what my message is tbh, I don’t intend to hurt anyone or anything about it, honestly I’ve seen the pictures and it was probably the most heart wrenching thing ever. My mom watched it all go down on TV when she was working at her work place at a school
creations-chat 2021-10-03 01:47:43 oh ok so I’m supposed to instantly know what it is even though it’s totally my fault for not knowing, maybe fucking next time tell me before I said something bla bla bla bs here <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <@!402265111189782540> because it’s not?

general 2022-02-07 03:43:19 like I said earlier, some idiot made a bad build by putting a tiny plane next to the tower in the corner of his plot then put smoke on the tower (top and bottom) on the plane too, it annoys me, I know it shouldn’t be brought up but I hate it people make horrible builds that replay the horrifying events that took place

creations-chat 2022-02-16 22:57:00 the maus hull should be shorter and not super tall and the parts where it edge off need to be adjusted, just a regular wedge shape instead of it being slightly rounded at the bottom, also the turret cheeks lined up with each other as more of a flat line between the two as there is a flat chunk of the cheek that isn’t rounded, it looks okay but I’d highly recommend to look at future ref images and model shapes because it could be really off putting if the shape itself doesn’t align correctly to any image or based on the ‘image’

creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:20:05 did you use mostly motorlock and trail pieces with cylinders plus sparks?
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:24:17 also, the tiny dots on the tank rear might either be trap doors or just trails with the top sticking out to give its “metal: shape idk anymore lol, but that’s a lot of motorlock if that was used, but I also wanted to point out that the panther turret is slightly off on the rear corner pieces of the turret since the panther 1 had slightly overlaying pieces, dunno what there is to critique about this build tbh
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:26:54 alright I wasn’t sure if they were trap doors or wing lights because some people use those in motorlocked tank builds, haven’t slept since 4 am so I’m probably speaking nonsense lol (my English bad)

yes that’s what I meant, you could just use control panels or wing panels to see if those work and then just disable control surfaces if it fits in, recommend making a experimental turret on the ground beside the build since I usually put my builds starting with example: 
HULL, TURRET, GUN <@!702907851001167882>
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:29:54 I gotta go anyways, school shit, I’ll try and talk later when I get back, but like I said, I’d recommend toying with a duplicate save build of the Panther
creations-chat 2022-02-22 12:32:01 yikes that’s a pain to fix, but overall good build, tbh I haven’t thought of using wing lights and trails for it, cya around
help 2022-02-22 23:48:52 frontal half of hull roof should be slightly shorter than the back or you could motorlock the rest of the top plus turret

creations-chat 2022-03-12 02:31:46 quick question, is there a tank I should build? I have no fucking thoughts whatsoever of making one and I don’t fell very well motivated ):
creations-chat 2022-03-12 02:35:16 Would be nice to build but I usually don’t take much in American tanks, mostly other tanks because usually American gets the most likes, but we got underrated tanks like LEOPARD 2A5 and 2A4
creations-chat 2022-03-12 02:41:00 True, but I have no idea how it’d be shaped even though how OBVIOUS it really is
creations-chat 2022-03-12 02:49:08 problem is, I don’t use all motorlock, I start with blocks, then locking and disconnectors
creations-chat 2022-03-12 02:54:54 I knew it would happen as well, I predicted that the Russians would have a harder time, they aren’t trained in Guerilla tactics

Gun mantle should have a shape like this: 

\    /
  |  |
but sideways, try checking the modules and shapes before you decide to post it, don’t forget the external fuel tank barrel that sits on a ( shape to hold it in (use reference Image)
barrel should be .5 blocks thicker all around, and you’re forgetting secondary 75mm kw.k gun
creations-chat 2022-03-17 22:15:58 I tried to give that, never got a reply probably due to it being too strong or because they don’t care? lmao the maus needs reworks, even I know it has a rounded cylinder on the right side of right cheek with 75mm kwk gun

general 2022-03-22 03:37:29 quick question
creations-chat 2022-03-22 03:37:42 will there be a possibility of adding specific shapes like instead of 1x0.9 we can go further down lower than a half block, including +15 half wedge and cylinders so we can make smaller gun parts for vehicles and doors? (**Not limited to armor pieces like armor skirts, or if we want thin armor like 45mm to 95mm for a med to light type**) 

I think having block shapes and sizes of all types would probably help motorlock builds and reduce block count. It’ll be more manageable for players who can’t build specific tanks due to block/size limitations of what we can use? like take specific engines including rolls Royce but more smaller to be able to fit it in for the realistic builds? <:stuff:908917207986208828> 

Another paragraph; having a block resizer or something could counteract what I said or contradict it so we don’t need to deal with having tiny pieces for one single part?

general 2022-03-22 19:25:09 some boy basically told one of my sisters to either date him or he’d kill her, I’m gonna gobsmack that kiddo if I see him, school counselor did nothing, nor did staff

general 2022-03-27 17:01:59 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-03-27 17:02:15 well yeah it’s true, people from my generation are something else
general 2022-03-27 17:02:38 quick question vanq, why are you so mad all the time?
general 2022-03-27 17:02:51 explain in <#504436696021204992>
general 2022-03-27 17:03:11 ok
general 2022-03-27 17:03:23 well at least they can build a lot better when it comes to mini sized builds
general 2022-03-27 17:03:39 yes they can
general 2022-03-27 17:03:43 are you blind?
general 2022-03-27 17:03:45 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-03-27 17:04:08 this conversation is over, I’m not gonna drag something like you into the dirt
general 2022-03-27 17:04:50 yes it is him
general 2022-03-27 17:06:08 are you attempting to counter my argument by showing poorly drawn lines on a T-72A of block sizes? Like what’s the issue with having Ro-scale, a lot of them already are well detailed, you can hate as much as you want but everyone knows that you’re just probably jealous <:trollface:775024642104229898> <@!749583096650661959>
general 2022-03-27 17:07:04 did you read the full thing, vanq hates ro scale lol
general 2022-03-27 17:07:18 alr
general 2022-03-27 17:07:24 but yes Ro-scale is easier too
general 2022-03-27 17:07:37 oh
general 2022-03-27 17:07:38 weird
general 2022-03-27 17:07:43 I thought it’d be the other way around
creations-chat 2022-03-27 17:08:17 vanq is angry that people can build well, ignore him or just poke fun of him, I could care less what’d happen to him if he got ban or warn <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-03-27 17:08:45 Interesting

general 2022-03-27 17:14:18 lmao Pathetic for a high rank of all V
general 2022-03-27 17:15:32 vanq just needs to shut the fuck up. He’s like a raging bull once he sees you build a Ro-scale or post it in <#384025409945337856>
general 2022-03-27 17:16:11 he can build good as much as he wants, but if he can’t build ro-scale and sucks at it then he  should just be quiet
general 2022-03-27 17:16:18 probably yeah
general 2022-03-27 17:16:32 I see him in the future getting a mute, potentially
general 2022-03-27 17:16:49 understandable, everyone struggles but vanq is just being a sad person
general 2022-03-27 17:17:15 ????

general 2022-03-27 17:19:17 lol
general 2022-03-27 17:19:24 turkey?
general 2022-03-27 17:19:27 what about it?
general 2022-03-27 17:19:46 good question
general 2022-03-27 17:20:15 bro why does this look like someone’s cousin
general 2022-03-27 17:20:41 depends, on the turret size as well
general 2022-03-27 17:21:09 unsure, I haven’t toyed with Ro-scale very much enough to know the basics
general 2022-03-27 17:21:29 I am trying to build smaller though
general 2022-03-27 17:21:41 yea but smaller usually, depends on that though
plane-crazy 2022-03-27 17:22:00 I’m getting major lag in other games
general 2022-03-27 17:23:16 true but a lot of people are going to prefer builds that aren’t entirely massive
general 2022-03-27 17:56:40 sweet dreams are made of dreams, everybody’s disappeared
general 2022-03-27 17:56:42 lol
general 2022-03-27 17:57:19 LOL
creations-chat 2022-03-27 23:53:45 it’s not bad for a start, try looking at images, references, blueprints, 3D models, or 2d side views, it’ll help you get really good much than some times, but **practice is recommended to do so**

if it’ll help, I’d try going for hull shapes that are more like wedge 1x2 or very sloped on the front and bottom, it might help, and practice on turret shape, its really basic but not bad like I said before, good job. <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2022-03-27 23:56:42 yeah, it takes forever if you’re mobile or not a pc user

creations-chat 2022-03-28 23:35:47 if the alpha is in April, when does it start? because I’m intrigued if there’s a test phase for players to play on


I hope so, I’d be more than be obliged to help test if he allows it
creations-chat 2022-03-28 23:39:01 It won’t, but the build in detail and size will be.. Because either new blocks means smaller parts or BIGGER parts, depends on what Rick and mad say about PC2 coming soon, in summer or April, (I assume July or during summer months)

no paint? Medic or not, pretty sure it should be painted, not a blank white state, medic planes don’t entirely have to be white be considered “medical”
creations-chat 2022-03-29 22:50:40 google some images, also fix the engines and make them custom 3 props instead of using the regular engines.
creations-chat 2022-03-29 23:53:18 have you tried adding half wedge triangles in wedge 2 for the corners next to the star text sign? honestly looks good, wasn’t really sure about the gaps on it
creations-chat 2022-03-29 23:57:35 alright, it should fit, if not, make a pancake layer to add those pieces with the same spot, should work as one.

bug-reports 2022-04-08 04:30:18 weird bug involving sparklers, ONLY happens if your sparks are saved to a **specific** build file, resulting in all sparks facing sideways all on left except for very first one on front, it’s already becoming a issue as far as I know, either it’s a corruption bug or due to the game dying inside
bug-reports 2022-04-08 04:30:36 not easily known unless somebody knows how to get around this issue
bug-reports 2022-04-08 04:31:04 had to replace the blocks about 1-2 times now, seems to be only the affected build(s)

creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:41:51 problem is with that challenger 2, it’s reposted and it has some low quality detail in some spots. blocky side skirt armor that need to be thinner and the emblems need fixing as it has lines in between
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:43:58 yeah no, are you trying to troll or what

literally pointed out that your emblem on the turret side needs to be more thin, it’s way too chunky, maybe try using a upside down V or something or /\
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:45:58 you need to fix it anyways, + reposted
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:48:38 so that by telling me my bio is going to prove anything? 💀

dont see what you’re trying to get at here

creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:51:14 ok??? is there a reason as to why you’re reposting my bio for the 2nd/3rd time?
general 2022-05-06 23:51:28 because they can’t handle what I have for a bio

creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:08:41 so basically wtf is happening here
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:13:39 This is the issue you guys, arguing leads to conflict, leads to people getting incredibly frustrated and or becoming complete assholes when it comes to builds, like let’s just talk about quality of detail and coloring and not start entire dumpster fire shitstorms here
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:15:51 please for the love of fucking god, stop arguing

this is getting us nowhere and will not benefit for anyone even for both sides <:empty:794431705070174238> 


also <@873696499513561088> drama started because it went from being on about one build to an entire group of people
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:17:59 why is it that we’re arguing over a steampunk build, I don’t get it


also rbk ask people to not argue here anymore, this shit is becoming annoying <@466793357318815744>
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:19:54 we didn’t used to do this shit 2 years ago not as bad as this situation, please don’t argue here unless it’s a much more civilized way of doing so

creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:31:18 So quick question, is there any way I could make a working spaceship hover?

I already tried once by using hovers, but I’m barely even used to using the system let alone at all, I am interested in criticism based on it.
and how to make it fly normally too

I suck at doing hovers because I don’t know how it works entirely based on Roblox’s physics
general 2022-05-09 01:32:23 hi fren <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:33:22 <@398673029221187614> so like is it using helium or ballast blocks for middle, sides, or front including  back and middle?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:36:04 so based on what you said, should I use wing panels or control surfaces to move around or just use rockets + ice and hovers?

I may have to make a in-game test bed for it

I may need assistance on how I could piece the man body unless I used a B-19 E body for a ref as I have a unfinished model of one that needs work
creations-chat 2022-05-15 00:43:58 Alright, I’ll try the best at my ability don’t expect it to turn out well due to how limited it is on mobile unlike PC while using a iPad <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-05-15 00:52:48 <@456226577798135808> 1x1 in red, 4 4x4s on both ends where should the tower go so everything fits?
general 2022-05-15 01:09:05 honestly I thought it’d more balance tbh
general 2022-05-15 01:09:41 I mean, what if you had a tail of a tyrannosaurus or a titanoboa
general 2022-05-15 01:09:44 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2022-05-15 01:10:08 still technically a tail
general 2022-05-15 01:10:15 because it’s their end and a tail
general 2022-05-15 01:10:29 snakes need tails to move

general 2022-05-15 01:11:34 honestly I don’t know
general 2022-05-15 01:11:38 I’d say monkey but ask him
general 2022-05-15 01:12:00 well that’s how they are
general 2022-05-15 01:12:06 fun fact:
general 2022-05-15 01:12:25 if one pops it fangs out, you better fucking run faster than sonic or egg man
general 2022-05-15 01:12:40 they can jump very fast if you piss it off
general 2022-05-15 01:12:58 add more rudder
general 2022-05-15 01:13:05 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-05-15 17:59:43 here’s a idea, if you want to be at idle, add a second motor that goes faster but turned off until you press a toggle button, kinda choppy with one turning motor instead of two, but this 3 prop rotor blade is good <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

not sure if this would be a good detail or not but it’s good to pay attention to detail
creations-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:00 better yet, 3rd motor could be manageable but it is a optimal choice of making 25% rotor speed, then 2nd would be 50 THRU 67% throttle capacity to which first is 100% so it depends on how the locking mechanisms are and where the extra motors are placed, **and I am looking for tips on a angle locking tower for the XB-36**

most planes have 3 levels of power I believe, but like I said before I am interested in tips for a locking tower so I can make a plane
creations-chat 2022-05-15 18:04:39 yes your welcome, and it’d be nice if we could make a compact toggle engine cover either using wing panels or trap doors with a motor connected via trails to keep it minuscule while still held together, i have NOT tried these myself but I think it’d would work as I’m somehow a friggin genius

trap doors as a extra fold for the engine cover especially ones you see in the FW 190 or other planes with double fold engine covers could have that neat detail too might work on PC2 because of how troublesome some of these parts are
creations-chat 2022-05-15 18:18:21 did the motor thing I suggest go awry?
creations-chat 2022-05-15 23:46:42 that little thing is just a b1b with 1.5

creations-chat 2022-05-28 01:53:57 Why is there a ugly fw with the worst tail landing gear and mid body section? 

Like it’s okay but so many issues with it that the cylinder canopy doesn’t look right with how horrible the main-mid body is, way too flat in a lot of places
general 2022-05-28 02:41:23 where did this come from
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:43:40 they’ll just fucking copy whatever they want, obviously not caring enough to make their own crap (jets & everything) and accidentally found one of their bases in a Tunisia military port

I don’t think it’s actually his unless he has proof it is (build)
creations-chat 2022-05-30 23:07:26 honestly I was thinking: oh shit maybe it’s a stolen build again but yet again there’s always possibilities

creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:04:01 actually now I want to make one
creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:06:48 sounds good, figured out how to make a 3 prop piston blade instead of being lazy and putting 4 blades <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
I’m guessing you probably used a lock tower to fit it together

if there’s one block affecting it from moving, I’d recommend painting that area based on where it’s coming from then narrow it down if it’s not a specific block

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:27:06 but more of rather, who’s more of a general idiot
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:27:10 compared to
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:27:32 smart people who know how to speak actual info that makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:28:08 roscsle, it doesn’t matter, builds are builds either way
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:28:24 why bicker about the scale when you can bicker on accuracy and detailing of a vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:02 man I just graduated from Highschool and I still can’t figure out a shit load of motor locking tricks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:25 a smaller scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:29 of the same thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:53 how so
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:29:55 show
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:30:28 how do people feel about hybrid vehicles or vehicles based off on heavy inspiration from the real thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:30:57 you know what would be really helpful for a suggestion to add when PC2 comes soon?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:36:37 let’s say you wanted to build something right? for example you want to move two sides without having to delete and remove all of it unless that’s preventing it from moving, so I’d been thinking of **why not make it so when a block is connected to another, there should be a orange highlight with a circle on the joint or “ligaments”**which could extraordinarily help improve issues with planes having uneven weight or parts that need adjusting more, just like the resize tool except for adding more angles so we can have a higher quality vehicle with extra sizes, you would have to just build one block, full circle and then add wedges in, select those block and drag them to a certain point until it fits the right shape
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:37:48 What I’m trying to say is, we need a resize tool that can highlight specific blocks you tap or click with, so if you wanted a custom angle but needed locking, this could produce more higher quality vehicles in PC2
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:38:07 you know how some vehicles are created by mesh right?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:38:23 why not apply a resize tool for that and use it for PC2 but it’s solid blocks you’re using
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:38:28 in orange highlight color
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:38:53 due to how unfairly limited we are with blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:17 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:23 truthfully speaking it does not
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:30 once you learn locking then it would be
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:43 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:39:51 how does this idea sound
creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:40:12 I didn’t really do anything, people just being assholes then oh no I get told “fuck you” via ping message which is what happened earlier <@914605911744593930>
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:47:36 oh shit my bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:49:39 here’s most of the blocks in wedges, half wedge, up and down then triangle blocks with specific highlight points in the ends or the middle top bottom, left and right or top and back  <@771407578285867108> most of these blocks could have a custom adjustment system capable of setting it at 0.1 or 0.5, basically a more complex resize tool with extra reach in terms of what you can and can’t resize
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:49:59 having a resize system going low as 0.1 would help builds with tiny details
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 21:52:40 Yes, but it could also have a ability of flipping it on either side of the same build, so like you want one side to be the same but it takes forever because you’d need to place more blocks in and make it heavier, this could help reduce lag for some builds however there should be a button that allows you to flip it unless you don’t need it to be turned on
creations-chat 2022-06-03 21:53:00 okay who pinged me

creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:33:41 <@426393733391581186> you really need to remove the gun and improve it with more detail as one barrel instead of 4 tiny ones, the whole body needs a redo, too boxy and just bland overall. maybe try going for a style or theme like steampunk buildings strewn atop of it
a lot of angles are way too flat, cutters need to be removed as they make it look worse
black box should be replaced, and the whole outside needs to be stripped down to bare minimum of blocks until it’s more highly detailed

general 2022-06-09 02:03:25 thick armor is all >100mm
general 2022-06-09 02:03:30 if angled correctly
general 2022-06-09 02:03:42 turret ring isn’t worth shooting unless it’s completely flat
general 2022-06-09 02:03:50 no
general 2022-06-09 02:04:05 T 34 85 turret + 76mm = death
general 2022-06-09 02:04:09 76mm is good
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:24:52 <@845396941373833226> That harrier really needs the rework, way beyond being recognizable in the rudder on top, body has way too much solid squares instead of actual key detail of the intakes, you could replace the cockpit with a cylinder canopy, another thing is wings are low effort and need to be redone and angled correctly as to per the wing span and shape from images

tail is oversized and need to be brought back down in shape, redone completely as I said before
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:31:13 man keep your mouth shut, before rbk does the funny jumpscare
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:33:30 wtf <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:35:44 there should be a role for a chat blacklist for preventing people who blatantly insult instead of trying to be helpful, <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
that works but it mutes for each channel
creations-chat 2022-06-09 18:38:23 that should be definitely added but rbk already said that <:trollface:775024642104229898>

ah ok, wasn’t sure and had forgotten if it was frig <@684099909137596476>
good quality though
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:08:39 another thing for criticism however, I would like to see the barrels of the singular cannons on the back replaced with a smoke pipe for more 3d effect as it looks slightly bare and I just wanted to point that out, and try using different blocks and experiment with them in different ways to make newer things, but besides that point I think it looks decent

creations-chat 2022-06-12 04:15:39 <@784197207125000202> Please delete that, low quality + effort, really didn’t need to screenshot it and use your phone to send it, instead of using in-game screenshot tool in ESC menu

I’ll repeat again since you didn’t read, I said it’s low effort and just massive rockets slapped onto a wall of messy blocks. kinda more than shitty build effort

creations-chat 2022-06-13 17:19:43 <@209005642000760832> You could fix the cockpit glass on the sides using smaller blocks like trap doors for example, or just half wedge downs so it’s less chunky on those sides of the canopy, body needs to be smoothed out with more angles & less of the blocks on the sides where the wings are, seems kinda skinny in front and back but super fat in middle

general 2022-06-17 03:08:41 when PC2 comes out, who would like to create some funny vehicles?
general 2022-06-17 03:09:40 I have too many sucky builds that litter my files, most I deleted which were low effort and last ditch from 2019, got too lazy trying to learn how to make crazy stuff like funny tanks
general 2022-06-17 03:10:12 I’m gonna go make angle lock build
general 2022-06-17 03:10:17 hopefully it works
general 2022-06-17 03:10:20 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2022-06-17 03:10:34 should I make a angled hull like this ^ shape?
general 2022-06-17 03:10:44 like IS-3 hull for example

general 2022-06-17 03:11:02 PC2 will give more options to make better details

general 2022-06-19 07:27:14 190mm
general 2022-06-19 07:28:07 well because previous people have done the same
general 2022-06-19 07:28:10 so
general 2022-06-19 07:28:33 honestly it’d be a play stupid game, win stupid prizes moment because others ruin it with actual ones
general 2022-06-19 07:29:12 I’d repost this but due to a lack of image privileges I must cope. <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

creations-chat 2022-06-19 07:30:29 Well alright, sounds rather weird also where is the bypass? That doesn’t sound like the yousuf I know very well, tbh instead of just calling it shit in pure form or well other means you could criticize it based on quality of detail and what should and shouldn’t be added to make it better, mostly low quality because people didn’t really give prop feedback instead but just continuous insults.
However, there are some here who will anything in their power to ruin that chance, but you are fine, just to clarify things, I am not saying you yourself are the issue
general 2022-06-19 07:30:51 lmao wtf
general 2022-06-19 07:30:54 that’s cursed

creations-chat 2022-06-19 07:35:00 Yeah honestly that’s a issue if people are actually allegedly ignoring stuff and going it though properly, I do have doubts as to what actually happened, is the bypass still existing or did the other get punished for it already? also I must sleep soon

creations-chat 2022-06-29 17:02:12 He’s speaking facts, you have cheese grater wings which are horrid. the body and engine intakes are poorly done, tail and rudder are also covered in cheese grater.
you didn’t even bother covering the two wholes in the middle of the body let alone the details of the nose, the glass makes it look way too big, he’s not brainless if he says it’s low quality, nose needs to be angle locked and redone, glass can be resized to using wing panels, disconnectors or something that’s in the 0.1 to 0.2 size range.

general 2022-07-05 07:14:11 maybach is using lgtbq as a stand point for his arguments at least 50/50% of times, and he refuses to acknowledge when he’s wrong
general 2022-07-05 07:15:04 get him off this server, he doesn’t belong here when he makes death threats

general 2022-07-07 19:29:45 agreed
general 2022-07-07 19:30:07 honestly PC2 also needs resize tools so we can make better stuff with parts that can’t be resized
general 2022-07-07 19:30:58 it’s not probably hard coded like the other game but we need more blocks
general 2022-07-07 19:31:09 wow
general 2022-07-07 19:31:33 75%?
general 2022-07-07 19:31:42 they’re probably closer to 80% or more
general 2022-07-07 19:31:48 above 80% prob
general 2022-07-07 19:32:23 yes
general 2022-07-07 19:32:26 because scripting
general 2022-07-07 19:32:31 is a pain
general 2022-07-07 19:33:06 think about how many lines of code per day is written x per week, then recorrecting tiny mistakes in tiny lines of coding

general 2022-07-07 23:56:50 is the nose tilt downwards of 5 degrees?

general 2022-07-07 23:57:20 depends
general 2022-07-07 23:57:37 because there’s a solid line that goes straight across and meets with the half wedge down 1x2
general 2022-07-07 23:57:50 unless I need to extend the nose and redo the angle locking
general 2022-07-07 23:58:10 is not being able to build the same as an art block

creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:29:02 dude just stop bringing up off topic subjects that don’t correctly relate with what we’re talking about. 
first thing, you need to learn and have tolerance when it comes to criticism and you’re just basically enforcing everyone else’s points without really making a good point for it.

second,  you don’t need to baby the living shit out of him, just let it go already & stop trying to do this shit 💀

general 2022-07-17 18:03:25 yes because why wouldn’t builds transfer?
general 2022-07-17 18:03:37 so therefore yes
general 2022-07-17 18:03:40 they will
general 2022-07-17 18:03:53 It’s a possibility
general 2022-07-17 18:03:55 only due to
general 2022-07-17 18:03:57 scripts
general 2022-07-17 18:04:08 also another thing is too
general 2022-07-17 18:04:20 there’s some tanks you can’t make due to block pieces being not there
general 2022-07-17 18:04:24 which sucks
general 2022-07-17 18:04:40 I was trying to make a super conq but instead it turned out not good
general 2022-07-17 18:04:49 thanks to lack of more angled blocks
general 2022-07-17 18:05:04 I got the back of turret

creations-chat 2022-07-17 18:46:23 couldn’t agree more, I guess he technically did copy which would make it indirectly copying

general 2022-07-18 00:59:52 angles
general 2022-07-18 01:00:05 so we can have tanks with funny angles like the obj 907s turret
general 2022-07-18 01:00:43 idk I feel like the lack of new blocks makes it feel less comfortable and more restrictive on what you can make be considered a angled block or block with angles
help 2022-07-18 01:02:48 No, that is against rules due to it not being your build <:stuff:908917207986208828>

engines have way too thin of propeller blades, body doesn’t look that good and needs detailing and improvement, canopy can be made thinner with wing panels, and instead of glass material it would look better with a canopy paint of a similar color scheme like 23,23,23 for example

work also needs to be done on the body as it seems to be way too jagged around the edges and not smooth enough to a point, maybe try toying with angle locking, it’ll make things easier to do while making it smooth, however angle locking might be harder for starters
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:16:28 <@438684293217255424> if you want to make your M777 towed gun look cleaner, I’d recommend painting the motors the same color, redo the barrel with cylinders instead of using solid blocks with green painted as it makes it look rougher on the edges, end of barrel* can be much smaller than using half solid wedges or half blocks, stands need to be redone, I’ll even prove you with a blueprint of what’s needed

we already gave you feedback
general 2022-07-18 18:17:35 how
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:20:21 <@438684293217255424> so far you are currently missing detail where the gun breach should be currently sitting in the very back, as I said before you need to put more effort into it, especially around the middle as it’s not fully solid blocks as shown here, the cannon itself seems to be way too fat in the creation posted, so far you’re missing a lot for the base as it’s a howitzer with a base & stands instead of just stands and no base with lack of detail
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:24:27 What on earth is this T-34? lack of detail for the sides, front, tracks, turret and guns itself 
Also too, 
why are there ladders on it???? 
<@689117587531104271> lacking in detail and effort so far, you need to improve it people will shit on you for making it look like crap in detail + PvP turret

if it was a type 63 you tried to make, you need to recolor, redo the whole thing and start over from scratch as the current one isn’t that awesome
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:26:57 <@689117587531104271>
if you were attempting to try to go for this, please redo the whole color, shape and detail
add numbers like **056** and emblems, it’s lacking in detail, missing track wheels and fuel tanks
creations-chat 2022-07-18 18:29:27 if you’re that good at detailing then fix your tank that you posted, hull, colors, fuel tanks, drivers hatch, it’ll just look like shit with the ladders being there and the wheels not having high effort put into it

help 2022-07-24 20:17:13 you can improve cockpit by changing the material from glass to default, then paint it 0, 0, 0. 
redo the body and tail, reduce the amount of control surfaces and place in more wing panels so it looks less like cheese grater wings and more of the butter smooth wings

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:19:38 yeah I guess that works
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:20:36 yeah so not impossible but very tedious
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:21:06 I hope this gives an idea of what I’m making
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:21:13 multiple joints
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:21:59 but like I need to figure out the mechanics first before I can build it
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:22:06 yeah knee can stay solid
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:22:21 I can design the pieces
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:22:30 but like it’s hard to find a good 3d model for that
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:22:43 so corner motors with gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 18:23:48 lcounter clockwise or clockwise?

general 2022-07-27 02:35:19 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
help 2022-07-27 02:36:30 here’s some advice, angle lock with 3.5 or 4.5 since it would go out 4.0 but that would be wrong so I’d recommend doing it 4.0 so it hits 3.5, unless it somehow doesn’t match up I’d keep trying until it works
help 2022-07-27 02:37:02 only way you could possibly make it work is if you made 4 angle locks and regular half blocks meet each other unless you wanna resize the whole thing

general 2022-08-15 00:28:39 I’m gonna crash a car
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:07:59 no you literally just shitted on him and called it shit just instead of giving good feedback, like example: his nose is out of place, missing intake, missing spine and correct jet body shape, wings need to be more back and up top not on bottom. 🗿

when someone makes a poor effort build instead of just calling it shit you could just help him next time improve it if you think you’re any good
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:11:31 just give feedback instead?
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:15:31 because it takes forever for someone improve, not everyone is instantly good, maybe wait a couple months and watch how far he gets in detail improvement and shapes

plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:48:00 I can make Japanese IJN flag if required
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:48:22 I was making King George V ship on sandbox (1)
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:48:34 since it’s easier to use corner triangles
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:48:47 hull is fucking good
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:48:56 Just minus super structure
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:49:21 I was gonna wanna make a German BB class
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:49:47 since you seem to know your shipwright stuff, could you help me with folding a Scharnhorst?
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:49:49 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:02 I haven’t made a good ship in a while
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:03 well yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:05 but what if
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:09 I goofed up by one block
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:17 meaning everything on it would have to be locked back
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:48 problem is, I usually make too much effort and then just Motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:50:56 I had to do that
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:51:02 for a train to fit correctly
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:51:11 due to a 1 fold
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:51:14 with side locks
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:51:32 also too I don’t know the superstructure well enough to know what I’m doing

plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:51:52 what would be a good scale?
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:54:00 I mentioned Scharnhorst
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 07:54:17 Triple barrel 13’’ main battery guns

creations-chat 2022-09-10 20:54:57 why are you like this 🗿
creations-chat 2022-09-10 21:48:10 What did he post and what happened?

general 2022-09-11 00:33:41 I can give you $12.5k in monopoly cash
general 2022-09-11 00:33:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:40:42 could just place like 3, 2 of them together and the other one by itself, and place a fuel rack with the 100 gallon barrels on top, then some parts like a landing gear, wing covers and whatever else fits

doesn’t look too bad!
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:41:51 if I may ask, what vehicle is sitting in the right corner of the hangar
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:41:54 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:42:18 not that
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:42:42 the white uncolored car thing whatever it is in the back beside the jet
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:42:54 oh

general 2022-09-11 00:44:24 it never existed
general 2022-09-11 00:48:20 wait what
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:49:55 if that’s what you want to do, I’d say either. also another thing, toy with angle lock and lock and you can get a cool computer set up like the ones where you see streamers with 3 screens or 2 angled monitors instead
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:51:53 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:51:55 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:52:08 but computer screens would be nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:52:12 maybe add some cables
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:52:13 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:52:16 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2022-09-11 00:52:34 the flood of the whitenames (reminds me of halo flood <:nooo:787097964946259978> )
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:53:25 better idea, just try to fit some locks + angle locking if possible with sparklers as cables, they seem thick enough to do the trick
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:53:32 the only criticism I have
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:09 the sharp edges for the wing covers could be fixed (wedges)
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:16 <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:27 yeah the plane itself
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:42 because I noticed the wedges kinda poke out
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:54:58 walltur rite
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:07 yeah that’s understandable
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:26 what about triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:32 oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:33 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:42 realized that might make it worser
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:46 true
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:54 I’ve seen people do angled wing lock before
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:56:55 it’s hard
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:57:08 what about it
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 00:57:10 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

how old are you 🗿
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:22:41 let’s take this to the dump since it’s just taking up creations, no point in bringing the drama here

if yousuf was here, mostly everyone here would’ve been muted
really stupid this is happening
move to <#495286269459300364> so people can enjoy themselves peacefully in creations chat

<@921250489281159231> I honestly have no idea what the fuck happened here but I wish yousuf was here to fix this mess of a argument
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:25:55 unfortunately people continue to surge in this debacle of a argument 🗿 thinking about pinging rbk since yousuf left

creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:28:58 <@466793357318815744> scroll up, and look at what drama has spawned upon us
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:31:41 like the first part I saw, it seemed like <@456226577798135808> had started arguing with others, then got insulted, everyone else got unfunny mad and drama occurred, 

https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1019794634148413451

this might serve as an example but drama is annoying and tiring and I do not want to see it in creations chat
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:33:49 how the fuck did this drama even start

also demanding for access to someone else’s account seems super sus
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:36:15 but it’s possible because you’re using a pc right? 
also they’re saying your build is a tut, i didn’t ask about if the build was being made fun of. 
could you care to explain why you were arguing with people here
honestly dude how the hell do you not have MS like TFN said
general 2022-09-15 02:39:20 <@456226577798135808> your point seems to be invalidated due to the fact you somehow have discord on a school computer
general 2022-09-15 02:39:26 but the question remains
general 2022-09-15 02:39:37 why did you ask for someone’s account though bro

general 2022-09-15 02:39:47 he got the brain pop app too

Neither is there hardly any good thing about it, the wings are terrible and could use a full re-design, the body sucks, the landing gear sucks, people need to learn and watch videos on how to improve, or try actually learning locking capabilities; you have, piston locking, angle locking, camera locking, his build was shit and had none of those things on it, that’s why I said what I said

telling me to Stfu doesn’t help either, you should give feedback too
creations-chat 2022-09-18 17:01:00 I might be getting expert from a train
creations-chat 2022-09-18 17:03:08 flexing your build time doesn’t mean anything, it’s meaningless aside from telling people how long you’ve played, thanks for the information 
there are standards here and we do not accept low effort builds in <#384025409945337856> 💀

general 2022-09-28 05:15:46 NO WONDER WHY IT SUCKS
general 2022-09-28 05:16:18 I actually do despise notch now for him seeking out buyers for Minecraft
general 2022-09-28 05:16:26 just happened to be Microsoft
general 2022-09-28 05:16:33 Microsoft is notorious for
general 2022-09-28 05:16:36 stupid shit
general 2022-09-28 05:16:41 like micro transactions
general 2022-09-28 05:16:44 💀
general 2022-09-28 05:17:39 The real reason I do is because I felt betrayed for someone who’s played since the Infdev on pocket and before leather had its current texture (old version eith the different stripes and more flat)
general 2022-09-28 05:17:46 I remember
general 2022-09-28 05:17:51 there being brick pyramids

general 2022-09-28 05:20:53 It’s always been meant to be a good building game, it got ruined thanks to Microsoft and their itty bitty transactions
general 2022-09-28 05:21:46 the majority of the MC community actually got super triggered after finding out a bout notch seeking Minecraft to sell to buyers like Microsoft
general 2022-09-28 05:22:02 okay uh

general 2022-09-29 02:31:12 As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
general 2022-09-29 02:31:19 that’s good

creations-chat 2022-10-02 23:00:01 cool plane
creations-chat 2022-10-02 23:02:39 you could fix the ladder pieces with angle locked trails with cameras so they don’t poke through the body with motors, would recommend coloring some 1x1 blocks with red or blue to make sure they line up correctly, half blocks could be cleaned from the wings so it doesn’t look as bad
creations-chat 2022-10-02 23:05:18 it’s pretty simple, just enable the motor with locking, however it goes back from .5 length to regular 1x1 when the motor moves

I’ll pull out a screenshot for you <@661016435534856213> to give you a better idea

general 2022-10-04 22:18:12 if this was the clone wars era, most of them would be ranked as cadets, privates and maybe captain

general 2022-10-04 22:26:13 if I would have been to dictate how the storm troopers would be, I would have changed the way the armor allows you to move, using the strongest clone wars armor set, train them every week x2, fix the aim entirely and give them better gear

plane-crazy 2022-10-15 04:16:46 it’s very Important for builds with custom angles on them
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 04:17:03 canopy*
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 04:17:15 because you aren’t doing it correctly

I’m guessing disconnectors are being used, also the build is fucking amazing you should apply for expert with that many upvotes,

however I would suggest using a white circle text for the tank light where the half wedge sits, tracks could be fixed with signs but I think It looks good even with the ladder tracks <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

fix the front of the intakes so it doesn’t look like it was done with haste probably should recolored those fronts, nose is also incredibly scrunched and can be easily fixed with angle locking and piston locks.
Another thing too, whats up with the cylinders and random pieces sticking out of the roof on the back?

general 2022-11-16 02:26:04 I’m guessing no considering 290mm is basically dead against 90mm heat rounds and 84mm rounds
general 2022-11-16 02:26:19 yeah
general 2022-11-16 02:26:22 that’s why I use

general 2022-11-16 02:26:31 well
general 2022-11-16 02:26:36 easy to turn hull

help 2022-11-20 21:48:44 multiple things that’s wrong with it:
there’s no window glass, there should be multiple shades of colors like 45,45,45 and 56,57,51 so there’s more color difference instead of one flat color
lights are also missing for tender (red light), front should have its lamp and bell I’m sure is yellow colored 
also add the smoke for the funnel if you wanna make it work and look still nice 
However it’s not bad but missing a lot of details for something that is going to probably be put on <#384025409945337856>
I like it but it needs a lot of work
help 2022-11-20 21:50:12 Simply my advice, put the layers of weathering, detailing when you are finished with main pieces don’t forget to add the ladders to the back tender and where they should be

general 2022-11-24 07:06:05 oh
general 2022-11-24 07:06:06 alright
general 2022-11-24 07:07:08 I have a custom tank chassis, that has the front hull partially done, uncolored driver cupola 
should I replace the glass blocks and use text blocks for the wedges on front so it looks more clean or just stick with glass material
general 2022-11-24 07:07:17 sides need a lot of work
general 2022-11-24 07:09:52 was thinking of placing in NERA and NRA armor in hull front and with 2 pancake layers for additional armor protection and for bottom hull plate
general 2022-11-24 07:10:14 maybe 120mm gun
general 2022-11-24 07:10:17 or 105mm
general 2022-11-24 07:10:36 105mm and 120mm are almost same caliber as a destroyers gun caliber
general 2022-11-24 07:10:52 depends on era of caliber and what it’s going up in measurement of caliber units
general 2022-11-24 07:11:36 not once lmao
general 2022-11-24 07:11:40 looks like a egg
general 2022-11-24 07:11:52 funny
general 2022-11-24 07:11:59 also quick question
general 2022-11-24 07:12:07 should I make internal tank modules
general 2022-11-24 07:12:11 like fuel tanks
general 2022-11-24 07:12:16 transmission
general 2022-11-24 07:12:33 NERA, ERA internal armor plating
general 2022-11-24 07:12:45 and having half decently detailed ammo racks
general 2022-11-24 07:12:56 very
general 2022-11-24 07:12:57 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-24 07:13:04 I can imagine how I would build it
general 2022-11-24 07:13:18 should I make it like the challenger 2 turret shape or something less difficult?
general 2022-11-24 07:14:54 lmao
general 2022-11-24 07:15:05 I was planning to go custom with but with some inspiration
general 2022-11-24 07:15:10 holy shit

general 2022-11-24 07:15:42 how dare you
general 2022-11-24 07:15:49 but ok lik
general 2022-11-24 07:16:05 should I use wing panels for internal armor like NERA or NRA?
general 2022-11-24 07:16:25 or just disconnectors because disconnectors have the same hitbox as half blocks
general 2022-11-24 07:16:31 yes NERA
general 2022-11-24 07:16:32 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-11-24 07:16:49 literally 4-5 spaced layers of added armor protection
general 2022-11-24 07:17:01 I can salvage a tank from a Japanese tank I was gonna make
general 2022-11-24 07:17:16 because the angles were messed up but I can save it no doubt
general 2022-11-24 07:17:24 Just mostly hull
general 2022-11-24 07:17:35 So I need to add a ton of details
general 2022-11-24 07:17:46 hi Hyperion

general 2022-11-24 07:18:27 it’s Cold War
general 2022-11-24 07:18:40 is there any modern tank details I should know of
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 07:18:49 I agree
general 2022-11-24 07:19:19 yes
general 2022-11-24 07:19:20 but like
general 2022-11-24 07:19:23 I’m talking like
general 2022-11-24 07:19:25 spaced armor
general 2022-11-24 07:19:30 tank modules
general 2022-11-24 07:19:36 that are actually color coded
general 2022-11-24 07:19:40 and NERA
general 2022-11-24 07:19:45 or NRA spaced armor
general 2022-11-24 07:19:56 because I could text or camera lock it
general 2022-11-24 07:20:09 eh it’s fine
general 2022-11-24 07:20:23 Cold War started using those same techniques as today
general 2022-11-24 07:20:31 especially stabilizers
general 2022-11-24 07:20:43 true
general 2022-11-24 07:20:48 you aren’t wrong
general 2022-11-24 07:20:52 that’s why I’m not going fully modern
general 2022-11-24 07:21:02 however I’m gonna use spaced armor packages
general 2022-11-24 07:21:09 yes
general 2022-11-24 07:21:11 I agree
general 2022-11-24 07:21:22 speedy and no armor except for front

plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:31:54 really?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:32:02 what year was this vehicle made in
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:32:04 1926?
general 2022-11-28 05:32:19 what

plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:32:25 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:32:35 damn it I missed it
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:32:37 by 10+ years
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:17 oh my god
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:23 not even enough to stop
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:27 a reversed k bullet
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:32 which is 15mm
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:33 of pen
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:37 how much
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:39 95mm pen?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:44 ah
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:48 I thought it was 95mm
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:34:57 90 mm isn’t bad but if you think about it
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:04 it’s terrible
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:05 for pen
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:13 yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:24 at 1.0 with armor lesser than a Mk V land ship
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:36 95mm-97.5mm depends on gun caliber
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:35:53 usually there are very few with that high of pen
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:36:09 was thinking of 102.5mm
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:36:22 or bare minimum of 100mm being
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:36:38 99.70mm of pen would be logically good enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:37:11 I might mount a custom 57-75mm caliber gun
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:37:42 true
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:37:54 however it’s good for knocking out crew with the reloaded and gunner
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:38:11 turret would be best for poking
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:38:14 not hull
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 05:38:22 I’m guessing people already use it wrong

plane-crazy 2022-12-02 05:35:40 Roblox and their wrong doings of 2014-2022:
- Removing Tickets from the system 
- Not hiring proper Moderation team/staff(s)
- Selling private user data to 3rd party companies in violation of Private user data act
- users being exposed to not family friendly games and mostly tricked by fake thumbnail(s), etc. 
- Removing Builders club, Changing their logo to a super ugly looking version of the O from a half circular shape to a complete full sliver square.
- Allowing people to prey on vulnerabilities of others, Having so far as shitty people in their actual staff letting it slide by without punishment whatsoever. 
- Roblox administration member bribed for $500 USD by a anonymous person who wanted to gain access to private information of where people lived & having caused a data breach by accepting the bribe.
- Suing Ruben Sim for 1.6m and tried to get all of his stuff in their hands which horribly backfired on ROBLOX itself and which made Ruben sim a staff member who is actively trying to fix the disastrous situation of a staff team

plane-crazy 2022-12-02 05:38:10 ask them, Ruben sim also knows why
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 05:39:10 it’s because they were a massive fucking billon dollar company who failed to provide actual evidence and tried to falsely get Ruben sim punished for prodding further into Roblox’s dark history of users being hideously hurt by others

general 2022-12-22 07:55:37 chances are also 1/75 of people doing so, they can’t tell if you’re there, that’s why I stick to PvE zones, nobody knows who’s where or what or when so it’s harder for someone to purposely find you, also there is a in-game fast travel system that is like the water under water but it’s clouds that allow you to go x2 speed and they drag your ship around the whole map, if you look you’ll see clouds drawn on the map in-game

general 2022-12-23 06:49:07 what’s a easy jet to make and get to rank V
general 2022-12-23 06:49:41 eh mig is too common these days, it would be downvoted within a week
general 2022-12-23 06:49:49 ok yeah the rank 3 is a issue
general 2022-12-23 06:49:51 I need to fix that
general 2022-12-23 06:49:54 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-12-23 06:50:16 I’m just gonna apply for rank 4 and call it good until I have access to proper vehicle making
general 2022-12-23 06:50:36 <@652341016510201856> it’s much easier to make hollow parts or internal parts in PC2 and then merge it together as one thing
general 2022-12-23 06:51:30 also too merging will be a simplicity no more locks
general 2022-12-23 06:51:41 so meaning you can do angles that are physically impossible
general 2022-12-23 06:52:07 otherwise would need a stupidly absurd lock count
general 2022-12-23 06:52:09 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:33 what?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:45 Russian jets suck ass nowadays.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:31:42 not really
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:31:57 zoom up on the current Russian arsenal and you’ll see they still use fucking rivets..
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:00 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:14 almost no air vehicle uses rivets still
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:26 which is why they’re using trash weapons
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:34 unreliable, can jam and explode in hands
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:49 especially retired AK-47s
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:32:56 no they came before the Chinese
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:07 china just copied off their test answers (Russian book)
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:29 Honestly I like it but it needs shades of colors
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:36 I notice a lot of builds without that shading
creations-chat 2022-12-26 04:34:40 Well for starters, don’t forget to add Main towers where the flag poles go with the radar and the main walk bridges that stretch out over the deck by +50ft, check images or sketch fab, however I appreciate how it currently looks unless you are going for the much older version before it was retrofitted for pre WW2, and end of ww2, tons of AA guns you could use trails for lines on the poles, unsure

let me pull up a image

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:40:06 right
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:40:19 main tower just needs a bit of extra thickness then I think it should be set
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:40:28 yeah that was slightly off
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:40:36 the angle makes it feel like it’s taller

general 2022-12-28 05:00:17 then he left
general 2022-12-28 05:01:24 the more we ping Rick at night or whenever he is asleep wouldn’t that slow down PC2 by him constantly trying to work on it with long night no sleep schedule

general 2022-12-28 05:04:15 ok so some true facts about PCC:
1: white names are the stupidest being to breathe this planets oxygen, meaning they have zero building skills
2: pride flags don’t belong in creations for obvious reasons, due to how much hate it can get.
3: ghost pinging rick when he trying to work on PC2 for us would probably make him take longer with no sleep schedules therefore PC2 could be delayed until 2023

general 2022-12-28 05:06:38 that’s called woke people and stupidity in a nutshell it doesn’t need to be there as it’s just fucking trolls who are most likely doing it for reactions

general 2023-01-04 21:02:27 because it’s reasonable and not unreasonable

general 2023-01-04 21:03:35 <@217336009455566848> can we have an update on what blocks will be implemented due to how limited plane crazy is with angles and wedges? 

Also we haven’t gotten winter map yet which I’m guessing is due to progress on PC2 being super slow
general 2023-01-04 21:03:46 within

general 2023-01-04 21:03:51 yes

general 2023-01-04 21:05:16 there isn’t enough angles
general 2023-01-04 21:05:18 and wedges
general 2023-01-04 21:05:21 to make

general 2023-01-19 01:33:23 is it that much to ask even though I have been playing since middle of 2018 and early 2019?
general 2023-01-19 01:33:58 there’s so many things they could have easily fixed by early 2020 but they just don’t wanna do it
general 2023-01-19 01:34:04 or don’t wanna hire people to do it
general 2023-01-19 01:34:07 utter laziness
general 2023-01-19 01:34:33 players will downright go afk if they don’t get their way etc
general 2023-01-19 01:34:38 it’s fun
general 2023-01-19 01:34:40 in some ways
general 2023-01-19 01:35:08 I get 4 kills on average without paying wdym
general 2023-01-19 01:35:14 highest was 6
general 2023-01-19 01:36:30 I’ve seen some players who buy premiums like the Progetto 46 medium tank with a 3 shell clip with less than 45% WN7/8
general 2023-01-19 01:37:10 there also happens to be a gravity fun mode even that comes on every once in a while and you can ram anybody with a very heavy tank above 100.0 tons and ram them to death
general 2023-01-19 01:37:19 it’s fun
general 2023-01-19 01:37:26 but playing realistic mode sucks ass

plane-crazy 2023-01-22 05:58:51 no you could just counteract the weight > bigger amount of thrust, just would need to adjust it until it goes back to same physics, if PC2 was out by now physically you’d be even more likely to be able to do stuff physics wouldn’t allow in pc1
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 05:59:11 Roblox physics actually fuck up plane crazy builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 05:59:44 Unfortunately Roblox updates too much, breaks motor2 and causes function ability issues, motor 2 would be unbelievably fucking awesome if Roblox itself stopped be so trashy towards its own physics and physics designing
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:00:54 It feels like to me Roblox has little to no care about their games water system, terrain quality, and amongst other things
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:01:12 I have tested their terrain in low quality devices, it is beyond horrible.
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:01:27 not worth for low devices which is understandable but sucks
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:01:41 There’s so many issues I could list if I truly wanted to
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:04:27 True timeline, Erik cassel never dies, takes place as CEO, David bazucki is arrested for the following: violation of private data user laws, Tax fraud, Fraudulent actions etc.
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:05:38 This is unfortunate because that’s caused by laziness to fix it all, instead they hire people with almost little to no script knowledge rather than hiring a well known established dev who could do a way better job than their mods
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:06:03 even though I have almost no scripting knowledge because I don’t toy with LUA or the other programs
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:06:12 that’s just poor writing right there
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:06:51 the water physics from Roblox itself don’t even offer properly balances nor proper surface > buoyancy to the entities in water
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:06:59 isn’t it obvious
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 06:07:21 100% true

general 2023-01-23 19:26:47 it looks horrendous because of the rigging and meshes
general 2023-01-23 19:27:05 I found very few items with R6 compatibly
general 2023-01-23 19:28:01 some do, others don’t
general 2023-01-23 19:28:17 Rthro has always been horrendous enough as it is
general 2023-01-23 19:28:39 Roblox will probably just become one of those copy paste companies with very bland style and no good stuff in it

general 2023-01-26 07:26:37 How to deal with shredders:
general 2023-01-26 07:26:38 Step 1
general 2023-01-26 07:26:41 Blacklist them
general 2023-01-26 07:26:43 Step 2
general 2023-01-26 07:27:01 annoy the living shit out of them until they get mad enough to want to kill you (they might rage quitted)
general 2023-01-26 07:27:17 step 3 turn off blacklist and go toe to toe with them in something much faster

general 2023-02-05 03:51:43 as I said before, I do not play PC, discounts usually make it cheaper to get a said vehicle, the higher the percentage the better
general 2023-02-05 03:51:51 15% off is the worst you can get
general 2023-02-05 03:51:56 45-75% is decent to best

general 2023-02-08 23:31:43 undes should be just banned automatically on the spot no question until they actually grow up usually which happen but the influx of undes is piss levels of pain
general 2023-02-08 23:32:25 I was going to insult something about this person but now I realize I may actually regret it
general 2023-02-08 23:32:38 Subreddit should be just deleted lol

general 2023-02-08 23:33:07 the ACTUAL subreddit would be full of people who left who aren’t undes and don’t ask stupid shit like undes do
general 2023-02-08 23:33:35 no only the portion comprised of undes, so it’s much better
general 2023-02-08 23:34:27 All of these builds are worthless and not worth the effort to critique considering the amount of bullshit they pulled here
general 2023-02-08 23:35:21 I saw it in creations, it’s just a solid lump of blocks, no actual effort aside from what appears to be tracks and armor and shape

general 2023-02-11 03:00:44 Is this actually PC2 or just a test game you made
general 2023-02-11 03:00:46 I’m curous
general 2023-02-11 03:01:05 seems really fun
general 2023-02-11 03:01:20 I could test my capabilities without having to go through the progress of motor locking every again
general 2023-02-11 03:01:34 who the fuck data wipes they seem like clowns
general 2023-02-11 03:02:27 I’m insanely good with making custom tanks and stuff if it’s not super complex like plane crazy is with motorlocks, F3X allows me to easily make customs and scaled decently, i saw a tank game called tank crew sim
general 2023-02-11 03:02:40 If PC2 was out by now I wouldn’t be limited
general 2023-02-11 03:02:41 right
general 2023-02-11 03:02:43 it doesn’t
general 2023-02-11 03:02:48 but f3x is somewhat ok
general 2023-02-11 03:02:54 used before in 2019
general 2023-02-11 03:03:33 If I’m gonna be honest
general 2023-02-11 03:03:43 7.1/10 for the complex building system
general 2023-02-11 03:03:53 Felt, I tried to draw a type heavy tank
general 2023-02-11 03:04:19 Between 7.53/10 and 9.23/10
general 2023-02-11 03:04:43 no the type 71 lol
general 2023-02-11 03:06:08 if I had easier building tool access I would probably already be expert rank by now
general 2023-02-11 03:06:12 I’m just too lazy

general 2023-02-11 03:06:20 plus it’s way harder to build on mobile
general 2023-02-11 03:07:47 and because of how old plane crazy is currently with the spaghetti code THERES a lot of issues that should be fixed when PC2 comes
general 2023-02-11 03:07:59 block merging would also be nice with a drag tool

general 2023-02-26 19:06:07 I’m really sick of 7-8 being decently part of cancerous down tiered guns from 9-10
general 2023-02-26 19:06:14 or auto cannons that just pen anything
general 2023-02-26 19:06:16 it’s so dumb
general 2023-02-26 19:07:36 I think your cat got copy pasted same with mine
general 2023-02-26 19:08:06 literally 5-8 is all cancerous until you run something that can fight back
general 2023-02-26 19:08:30 centurion might not work
general 2023-02-26 19:08:39 is it the Mk 5
general 2023-02-26 19:08:41 or Mk 3
general 2023-02-26 19:09:21 <@458012038594166795> do you play CTS

general 2023-02-26 19:09:43 do you want to VC
general 2023-02-26 19:09:49 because I need someone who has brains
general 2023-02-26 19:10:10 too many cancerous bullshit team mates who do nothing except run same direction and proceed to die
general 2023-02-26 19:10:17 enemy team got free kills
general 2023-02-26 19:10:44 couldn’t do anything once they pulled auto, tier 10 gun on a low tier hull and turret
general 2023-02-26 19:11:07 I’ve had it
general 2023-02-26 19:11:12 with auto guns in 7-8
general 2023-02-26 19:11:25 they shouldn’t be able to pen considering how thick the armor is on most tanks
general 2023-02-26 19:11:36 I do
general 2023-02-26 19:11:38 use that
general 2023-02-26 19:11:54 tried, doesn’t work when you have 3 guys killing you
general 2023-02-26 19:11:59 hi sym
general 2023-02-26 19:12:18 128mm is easy to use with stab but you have no armor
general 2023-02-26 19:12:34 plus reducing the reload to lowest as possible makes it better
general 2023-02-26 19:12:45 wait, when??
general 2023-02-26 19:13:39 I don’t check very often
general 2023-02-26 19:13:54 it does
general 2023-02-26 19:14:00 84mm 20 pounder sucks now
general 2023-02-26 19:14:22 what??
general 2023-02-26 19:14:24 since when?
general 2023-02-26 19:14:29 holy hell
general 2023-02-26 19:14:36 no wonder I couldn’t pen that shot on cheeks
general 2023-02-26 19:14:39 also I got super lucky
general 2023-02-26 19:15:01 I aimed a shot where it was less than 200mm of armor based on angle
general 2023-02-26 19:15:07 or I hit through the gunner sight
general 2023-02-26 19:15:22 but it ended up killing this full maus
general 2023-02-26 19:15:39 honestly
general 2023-02-26 19:16:01 I think 5-8 should be where there’s a grey line so nothing is super OP or downright nerfed to hell

general 2023-02-26 20:37:01 yeah it’s not that difficult though
general 2023-02-26 20:37:16 Bigger builds are easy to fix sometimes but harder to build up
general 2023-02-26 20:37:41 it’s a 2-8-4 so I kinda hate how it’s turned out aside from smaller details

general 2023-03-20 18:20:30 <@832352865804484628> well why I pinged was because I am having collision issues with my triple blade engine
there are blocks within the engine that block the motor from moving
general 2023-03-20 18:28:46 tech
general 2023-03-20 18:28:50 how does one fix collision

general 2023-03-20 18:30:40 ok but legitimately I have an actual question for a build I was working on
general 2023-03-20 18:31:32 basically my triple blade engine doesn’t work because of an issue where the block collides with the motorlock tower within the nose which doesn’t allow me to spin it like it should be spinning
general 2023-03-20 18:31:45 I have tried using texts

general 2023-03-20 19:13:01 I don’t know, I tried asking two others before
didn’t even know others had before me
general 2023-03-20 19:15:05 <@318892614378061824> so basically the motor seems to be caught on a block I don’t know where, I messed around with the nose a lot and it did nothing to it unless I need to remove the old nose design and replace it with a separate tnt lock tower using texts maybe

general 2023-03-27 01:13:06 Because of extremely heat from either factory processing or due to the heat outburst upon the hammer ejecting the shell/round, it heats up with energy but cools down insanely fast upon exposure from air and breezing through the wind at over 1k mph
general 2023-03-27 01:13:11 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-03-27 01:15:24 Rounds can also heat up upon penetration on a object such as a 50 cal round hitting directly into solid metal or any mm of armor that isn’t strong enough against a .50 BMG round

plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:37:50 The downfall of PCC, as heavy watched all of it go downhill. The heavy gearings clocking in his face to react & watch as time went on. No more active PC, just unde whitenames being a general annoyance to everyone, no updates or words from rickje since over 2 months ago. With PC2 no where in sight, everyone has become weary, waiting someday for an actual update on PC2 when it has been promised time & time again. Waiting for the moment of PC2 releasing like the equal equivalent of valve being unable to count to 3.
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:38:24 WE NEED PC2 NOW

general 2023-04-17 05:32:14 we’re fucked
general 2023-04-17 05:32:48 well yeah no kidding that too
general 2023-04-17 05:33:09 I feel like the U.S has a whole list of issues
general 2023-04-17 05:33:17 and other places
general 2023-04-17 05:34:12 don’t think it’ll happen anyways
general 2023-04-17 05:34:44 the commanders have to agree to launch with their launch keys, if only 1 agrees but the rest don’t, it won’t confirm
general 2023-04-17 05:35:10 As a safety measure to prevent
general 2023-04-17 05:35:13 problems
general 2023-04-17 05:35:28 most nukes are probably not in top shape anymore
general 2023-04-17 05:35:41 they most likely aren’t rusted away yet
general 2023-04-17 05:35:49 Just stored in places where you can’t find them
general 2023-04-17 05:36:02 Demon core was the last atom bomb ever made, nobody dares to touch it
general 2023-04-17 05:50:01 what the heck happened here

general 2023-04-17 05:50:51 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2023-04-17 05:51:00 I said gonna sleep
general 2023-04-17 05:51:01 wtf
general 2023-04-17 05:51:29 apparently accidentally saying gonna with 3 n’s instead of 2 is filtered
general 2023-04-17 06:12:00 Is it better than tech tree?
general 2023-04-17 06:14:17 reload time?
general 2023-04-17 06:14:36 Wtf
general 2023-04-17 06:14:40 For 400 dmg.
general 2023-04-17 06:14:42 that’s dumb

general 2023-04-17 06:16:39 God I don’t like how blitz is
general 2023-04-17 06:16:43 kryos is still OP
general 2023-04-17 06:16:48 compared to its tech tree counterpar
general 2023-04-17 06:16:58 over 200 dmg per shot if high rolled
general 2023-04-17 06:17:03 it takes prem to go through the front
general 2023-04-17 06:17:11 and regular through sides
general 2023-04-17 06:17:18 because armor is yes
general 2023-04-17 06:17:24 and it takes everything it receives
general 2023-04-17 06:17:55 because “logic”
general 2023-04-17 06:17:57 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-04-17 06:18:18 it would literally miss the tank itself, shattering the window and does nothing unless HE
general 2023-04-17 06:18:37 I hate blitz but don’t mind messing around
general 2023-04-17 06:18:51 also any suggestions for making the shoulder to ball join on a mech
general 2023-04-17 06:19:01 I thought of a decent shape but not sure if it’ll work
general 2023-04-17 06:19:33 Nashorn still easy to kill
general 2023-04-17 06:19:42 countered by HE
general 2023-04-17 06:19:44 easily
general 2023-04-17 06:19:46 no armor
general 2023-04-17 06:19:50 WHAT
general 2023-04-17 06:19:52 HOW MUCH

general 2023-04-17 06:19:57 40??
general 2023-04-17 06:20:16 But still flat enough for HE go through
general 2023-04-17 06:20:19 pretty sure
general 2023-04-17 06:20:29 KV2 will just annihilate it
general 2023-04-17 06:20:31 one shot
general 2023-04-17 06:20:48 doesn’t matter how much of a angle of armor, it’ll do full dmg rng or almost max dmg
general 2023-04-17 06:20:56 what’s the full HP
general 2023-04-17 06:21:13 pointless
general 2023-04-17 06:21:20 HP won’t save it either

general 2023-04-17 06:24:10 tier 6 is full of seal club

general 2023-04-17 15:43:01 They’re also new erdiuim based products, highly expensive and experimental

general 2023-04-18 22:04:02 I have a whole list of problems with Roblox itself
general 2023-04-18 22:04:08 does anyone else want to add on to it

general 2023-04-18 22:06:51 they’re really good people from my experience
general 2023-04-18 22:10:07 Ok so here’s a list of all that’s wrong I can remember with Roblox itself
general 2023-04-18 22:10:11 We have issues such as:
||P words|| (treat them like animals) 
people who downright exploit others for cash grab reasons
Roblox sells user data to 3rd parties for $$$
Low quality UGC copies made off actual limiteds, Allowing UGC to go limited.
Removal of BC-OBC was a “smart move”
Tickets were removed due to how easy it was to abuse the exchange system. 
Removal of the genre filter, they also have stopped caring for devs, allowing infamous companies to violate their employees by not paying or being insanely passive aggressive towards them.
Meepcity and Alexnewtron did nothing to fix the issue(s). 
Copy paste influencer events; such as making sponsored events that don’t make sense. 
Massive cashgrab
Toxic community
Laggy
Almost impossible to get robux without paying
general 2023-04-18 22:11:03 outdated coding since 2006, explains the lag <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2023-04-22 02:48:49 Majority of people would disagree and say right now “fortnite sucks because it rots your brain for majority of what it is” this is true, however I see opportunity in the new creator map tools they created recently

general 2023-04-22 02:55:03 3080ti is somehow decently priced nowadays, between 600-850 USD that’s well over nearly closer to 1k, alone today that would more than 700-900 because of inflation, you obviously wouldn’t be able to afford on short run unless you did it long run, i really doubt you could have came up with the money unless you used a strat to do it.

general 2023-04-22 21:08:15 wow

general 2023-04-23 06:59:37 this ain’t funny chief
general 2023-04-23 07:02:04 but there’s a point, if you keep calling someone the wrong thing, they’ll probably either A: bitch slap you or B: get tired of you calling them the wrong thing, it isn’t based. It’s just fucking common sense, it’s better to respect them regardless of whom they may be. Another counterpoint: unless they’re someone who has committed illegal crimes against small body people and or animals.

general 2023-05-18 01:45:37 texts

creations-chat 2023-05-18 01:49:07 I’d suggest dark to decently not too bright but just low to mid-high like lowest grey would be 50,50,50, or 40,40,40. to above like 70,70,70 and 90,90,90 for high setting, i used these shades before but test and mix it together on 3 example or mix two for a decent pick

general 2023-06-15 06:59:19 stop using alt

general 2023-06-15 06:59:31 good
general 2023-06-15 06:59:41 You’re gonna probably end up ban bypassing anyways
general 2023-06-15 06:59:55 I’m already predicting you’ll be banned in a few hours from now

general 2023-06-15 07:01:55 If there’s a hole, there’s a goal.
general 2023-06-15 07:02:31 In your perspective yes, but however my foot is going somewhere not so nice
general 2023-06-15 07:02:49 I’ll smash it with a 8 pound maul
general 2023-06-15 07:03:09 No because then you’d be IP banned in here, it is possible
general 2023-06-15 07:03:28 I’ve seen people get banned from being able to rejoin under the same account link, there is a special system
general 2023-06-15 07:03:50 Good becaude every time you come back, we can just submit more to discord staff to get rid of you

general 2023-06-15 07:04:05 well then
general 2023-06-15 07:04:55 Every time someone interacts with me and starts shit like this, this is what happens. If you promise to not start shit and NOT have multiple alts, you won’t disappear like the rest of the graves I have taken and filled to the brim with a coffin and dirt where Banland is.
general 2023-06-15 07:05:29 I don’t think he got it legitimately
general 2023-06-15 07:05:33 we should remove it

general 2023-06-15 07:08:39 yes but if it involves ruining a server, and causing issues then it’s a issue for discord to fix
general 2023-06-15 07:08:49 <@456226577798135808> I know you faked shit against one of my friends

general 2023-06-16 21:39:58 yeah watch out for Robert
general 2023-06-16 21:40:03 he claimed to have alts
general 2023-06-16 21:40:12 at least 4 from what he claimed in PCC general yesterday
general 2023-06-16 21:40:55 someone being generally annoying
general 2023-06-16 21:41:25 <@584060481522761728> I think it’s possible Robert might be back soon
general 2023-06-16 21:41:31 he said himself he had a main on here
general 2023-06-16 21:41:39 and 3-4 different alts?
general 2023-06-16 21:41:40 idk
general 2023-06-16 21:41:52 Not that I can recall or know of
general 2023-06-16 21:41:57 but definitely lock him out
general 2023-06-16 21:41:59 IP wise
general 2023-06-16 21:42:13 because I know he will just come back to harass PCC
general 2023-06-16 21:42:25 discord can just ban him on the spot even with VPN
general 2023-06-16 21:42:41 no it’s not illegal to IP ban somebody who is being an asshole
general 2023-06-16 21:42:44 yeah
general 2023-06-16 21:42:48 which will h
general 2023-06-16 21:42:50 happen
general 2023-06-16 21:42:52 eventually
general 2023-06-16 21:43:08 there’s a lot of internet stuff people don’t know
general 2023-06-16 21:43:15 wouldn’t work
general 2023-06-16 21:43:46 Internet address would remain the same as long as he doesn’t know how to change it
general 2023-06-16 21:43:52 I doubt he even has the money to do that
general 2023-06-16 21:46:05 <@866848584888877077> Robert also claimed to have alts, i would recommend watching out in the new users for a bit incase if he comes back, he said that he has a main on here as well which is just bypassing ban
general 2023-06-16 21:46:37 probably offline mod
general 2023-06-16 21:46:39 idk
general 2023-06-16 21:46:52 they appear as offline so new people don’t instantly annoy the shit out of them
general 2023-06-16 21:46:58 yeah

general 2023-06-21 21:27:50 game was forcing it as a thing, non-toggle option. then I restarted and changed the pc background color and boom fixed one day
general 2023-06-22 02:25:38 I just realized somehing
general 2023-06-22 02:25:45 it most likely is
general 2023-06-22 02:26:01 how the fuck did they lose a sub without using sonar first??
general 2023-06-22 02:26:25 the sub should have had a guide expedition sub to show them the way back
general 2023-06-22 02:26:34 why wasn’t there any radio contact either
general 2023-06-22 02:26:37 yeah
general 2023-06-22 02:26:44 surpised they would use a PS4 controller
general 2023-06-22 02:26:46 of all things
general 2023-06-22 02:26:48 which is made
general 2023-06-22 02:26:56 of plastic casting and mold

general 2023-06-22 02:27:25 they claimed the group also would get mood swings so I’m going to assume they broke the controller
general 2023-06-22 02:27:33 which is most likely
general 2023-06-22 02:27:35 stupid
general 2023-06-22 02:27:39 damn

general 2023-06-22 02:38:10 ffs
general 2023-06-22 02:38:28 I really hope they didn’t disturb any of the wreckage

general 2023-06-24 02:15:18 I don’t think someone saying you fell off is instantly true unless we applied this to hars before he left and this would become true
general 2023-06-24 02:15:22 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
general 2023-06-24 02:16:17 and fat
general 2023-06-24 02:16:20 255
general 2023-06-24 02:16:27 256 pounds
general 2023-06-24 02:16:37 same amount of fat to equal to a 250 lbs bomb
general 2023-06-24 02:16:55 so realistically you’d need to be insanely fat to equal the amount of tnt there is in a 250 lbs bomb
general 2023-06-24 02:17:16 mf is big boned like big smoke
general 2023-06-24 02:17:18 <:stuff:908917207986208828>

general 2023-06-24 02:21:33 atm
general 2023-06-24 02:21:35 but
general 2023-06-24 02:21:40 glad you weren’t here when hars was
general 2023-06-24 02:21:49 <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍
general 2023-06-24 02:21:57 there’s a singular emoji for this but I don’t have it
general 2023-06-24 02:21:58 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-06-24 02:22:13 uhh
general 2023-06-24 02:22:14 he downvoted
general 2023-06-24 02:22:17 and gave
general 2023-06-24 02:22:21 very vague
general 2023-06-24 02:22:26 criticism
general 2023-06-24 02:22:41 he would just downvote everything
general 2023-06-24 02:22:42 yes
general 2023-06-24 02:22:46 even good builds too
general 2023-06-24 02:22:48 💀

general 2023-06-24 02:22:53 into
general 2023-06-24 02:22:55 plane stuff
general 2023-06-24 02:23:01 you know how furries exist?
general 2023-06-24 02:23:03 imagine
general 2023-06-24 02:23:04 this
general 2023-06-24 02:23:06 planes but
general 2023-06-24 02:23:08 woman

general 2023-06-24 02:23:36 <:empty:794431705070174238> 💀
general 2023-06-24 02:24:01 no
general 2023-06-24 02:24:04 we found out
general 2023-06-24 02:24:06 he was into
general 2023-06-24 02:24:08 That
general 2023-06-24 02:24:30 ok this sub shit is getting out of hand
general 2023-06-24 02:24:32 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1121988212911509605
general 2023-06-24 02:25:33 I know, I saw that shit and I’m like wtf
general 2023-06-24 02:25:35 💀
general 2023-06-24 02:25:43 HOW TF DOES THE CONTROLLER SURVIVE ALL OF THOS
general 2023-06-24 02:25:58 yeah..
general 2023-06-24 02:26:00 surprisingly
general 2023-06-24 02:26:11 now it lays in the wreckage of the gravesite that was added onto
general 2023-06-24 02:26:19 the new stuff will cause the old stuff to freak out
general 2023-06-24 02:26:23 yep
general 2023-06-24 02:26:39 There’s a good chance
general 2023-06-24 02:26:45 That the bodies are mostly intact
general 2023-06-24 02:26:48 or crushed
general 2023-06-24 02:26:53 Just gone
general 2023-06-24 02:26:58 yeah
general 2023-06-24 02:27:00 but their stuff
general 2023-06-24 02:27:02 is still there
general 2023-06-24 02:27:32 I really hope the implosion doesn’t change the bacteria on the titanic due to how old it is
general 2023-06-24 02:27:48 it could easily crumble since there is fresh human remains and other stuff
general 2023-06-24 02:27:58 yeah like 1,600 feet away from it
general 2023-06-24 02:28:07 which is ok but still
general 2023-06-24 02:28:29 the former titanic families relatives (currently living ones) are really pissed off atm
general 2023-06-24 02:28:48 Saying that people shouldn’t go down there to see it
general 2023-06-24 02:29:29 I mean… yeah, new visitors would disturb the wreckage site and bring stuff to potentially harm the site
general 2023-06-24 02:29:44 Yes it did.
general 2023-06-24 02:30:14 titanic is a death site, and nobody else should go down there unless it’s for a **very** good reason
general 2023-06-24 02:30:16 I know
general 2023-06-24 02:30:18 he didn’t want to
general 2023-06-24 02:30:27 it’s the damn deo
general 2023-06-24 02:30:28 ceo*
general 2023-06-24 02:30:31 that killed everyone
general 2023-06-24 02:30:33 on board
general 2023-06-24 02:30:47 Stupid ass took 4 peoples lives for being selfish like he was
general 2023-06-24 02:31:02 And look where it got him
general 2023-06-24 02:31:10 yes
general 2023-06-24 02:31:15 carbon fiber will not work
general 2023-06-24 02:31:17 you need
general 2023-06-24 02:31:22 solid steel and metal to hold
general 2023-06-24 02:32:05 I would understand if they needed a controller if someone couldn’t understand how a sub would normally function with a wheel type
general 2023-06-24 02:32:13 good question
general 2023-06-24 02:32:19 it usually should be
general 2023-06-24 02:32:23 safety requirements
general 2023-06-24 02:32:40 so much for being rich
general 2023-06-24 02:32:42 💀
general 2023-06-24 02:33:24 At least the other 4 can rest peacefully knowing they didn’t suffer a insanely gruesome death compared to the titanics souls on board
general 2023-06-24 02:33:29 yea
general 2023-06-24 02:33:45 <@866848584888877077> will Titan sub creations be considered warnable
general 2023-06-24 02:33:53 I’m curious
general 2023-06-24 02:34:03 5+ to the current souls
general 2023-06-24 02:34:28 building titanic is fine
general 2023-06-24 02:34:30 but making
general 2023-06-24 02:34:35 soemthing that’s still recent
general 2023-06-24 02:34:37 somehow
general 2023-06-24 02:34:43 depends on context and intentions
general 2023-06-24 02:35:10 9/11 may seem like a long time ago but it’s still fresh in people’s minds
general 2023-06-24 02:35:30 ok so what if I or somebody else made something that offended your own death
general 2023-06-24 02:35:36 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2023-06-24 02:35:58 you mean
general 2023-06-24 02:36:01 water
general 2023-06-24 02:36:03 oh
general 2023-06-24 02:36:22 They didn’t drown thank god
general 2023-06-24 02:36:26 better than drowning
general 2023-06-24 02:37:32 can you even imagine being in a horrific situation where you end up drowning at even like 100 feet or running out of oxygen causing the hull to crush you slowly?
general 2023-06-24 02:37:50 <@567763933952475157> the titan sub incident was ceos fault
general 2023-06-24 02:38:11 better than being in the dolphin chamber 💀
general 2023-06-24 02:38:25 apparently that’s weird because media kept saying shit about oxygen
general 2023-06-24 02:38:58 yeah that happens a lot
general 2023-06-24 02:38:59 with media
general 2023-06-24 02:39:37 having a fast instant death is probably better than having a slow agonizing death
general 2023-06-24 02:39:46 no not that one
general 2023-06-24 02:40:05 I’m talking about the dolphin diving incident where the crew were crushed
general 2023-06-24 02:40:18 oh god no.
general 2023-06-24 02:40:33 anyone would have said no shit Sherlock but it is true.
general 2023-06-24 02:40:39 uhhhh perhaps
general 2023-06-24 02:40:44 I don’t wanna remember
general 2023-06-24 02:41:30 because it is true and I would probably prefer a quick death than something slow like being burned or crushed slowly by something that you knew you couldn’t stop from happening
general 2023-06-24 02:41:47 ture
general 2023-06-24 02:41:53 WHY DO YOU PLAY IT
general 2023-06-24 02:41:56 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-06-24 02:42:17 LMFAO
general 2023-06-24 02:42:22 didn’t even hit at the right angle
general 2023-06-24 02:42:28 unless I’m wrong
general 2023-06-24 02:42:35 kinetic force?
general 2023-06-24 02:42:37 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2023-06-24 02:42:58 the blade looks bent
general 2023-06-24 02:43:00 <:m_:778994206948589638>

general 2023-06-24 02:44:11 because it’s been around
general 2023-06-24 02:44:17 longer than the troll face man
general 2023-06-24 02:44:21 before he
general 2023-06-24 02:44:23 died
general 2023-06-24 02:44:38 troll face singer is the reason I think it added more fuel to the troll face

general 2023-07-05 13:54:32 Honestly I don’t know what the direction is PCC going in, we haven’t gotten any words from Rick himself and he barely interacts with us as a community and we need this, it’s dire and people in PCC have left and stopped playing plane crazy of because how dry PCC has become. sitting on our asses all day playing plane crazy but doing absolutely nothing to fix some issues like build quality posts, it could be fixed by teaching and trying to getting them to learn better as it’s just gone bad.

general 2023-07-06 01:48:55 uhm wtf
general 2023-07-06 01:48:58 <@635268221489905666> illegal
general 2023-07-06 01:49:03 copy scripts are frowned
general 2023-07-06 01:49:05 upon
general 2023-07-06 01:50:18 <@883063424614006878> but like, you gotta agree with me here 

PCC really has hit rock bottom with the lack of content or updates to concurrent game
general 2023-07-06 01:50:44 And it would cause more issues, if one of them has access to both VIP1 and expert then we fucked
general 2023-07-06 01:50:57 I spoke to Rick, there is a insanely bad amount of ping
general 2023-07-06 01:51:04 **16.000 ms**
general 2023-07-06 01:51:13 bug
general 2023-07-06 01:51:21 no but the past was an issue
general 2023-07-06 01:51:33 because rhat was 2 years of no updates
general 2023-07-06 01:51:38 well
general 2023-07-06 01:51:39 yeah
general 2023-07-06 01:51:41 I’m glad
general 2023-07-06 01:51:42 it is
general 2023-07-06 01:51:50 but what about the copy scripts issue
general 2023-07-06 01:52:13 ok jesus I was joking, I’m not pretending he has not spoken here
general 2023-07-06 01:52:22 fuck now my eye lid is twitching again
general 2023-07-06 01:53:02 lava is fucking laggy when something collided with it

general 2023-07-06 01:53:16 <@914605911744593930> I feel like there’s a lot of things missing to PC1
general 2023-07-06 01:54:00 improved train tracks that can adjust based on wheel size so it won’t display the same for everyone, and train engine physics based on size and supposedly “weight”

we also need proper train gears like valves and pistons and rods
general 2023-07-06 01:54:25 or have a workshop like gmod does
general 2023-07-06 01:54:29 for this sort of stuff
general 2023-07-06 01:54:59 yes
general 2023-07-06 01:55:02 for the love of god
general 2023-07-06 01:55:36 What is it
general 2023-07-06 01:56:28 is this hars AUSTISMO cousin
general 2023-07-06 01:58:18 <@538169956735647745> but imagine how useful it would be to have tracks all the same layout, transparent to others except yourself based on who uses it, adjusted with manual loading but it doesn’t affect others when it loads in. I feel like this would allow my build to fit on tracks properly
general 2023-07-06 01:58:48 hey could someone give me a hand on locomotives

general 2023-07-09 14:14:18 I really hope so
general 2023-07-09 14:14:58 There should be a PUBLIC list of usernames who have used copy scripts that could by shown by using the ? Or $ command to show a list of people who have committed to stealing builds
general 2023-07-09 14:17:06 Yeah and they fucking stink
general 2023-07-09 14:17:21 someone tried to copy my 3.5k polar express but it looked like a 2 years olds drawing

general 2023-07-09 14:19:01 It would be nice to have people who use copy scripts or copycats be blacklisted from playing PC2 when it comes out
general 2023-07-09 14:19:09 So they can’t enjoy the funny stuff

bot-central 2023-07-09 14:28:58 $help
bot-central 2023-07-09 14:35:11 $suggest due to how recent copy scripts Rick spoke about on pc1, I figured this idea would help reduce the amount of copy script user even with the block ID change there should be a countermeasure incase if they are a repeat offender with copyscripting builds especially high effort builds

a public list of users or a blacklist for players who aren’t allowed to join PC2 for a while
general 2023-07-09 14:38:42 oh god no
