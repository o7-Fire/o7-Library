bug-reports 2023-01-04 02:21:24 Physics objects tend to not update after leaving contact with objects after a disconecter activates (have footage but don't have upload perms)
bug-reports 2023-01-04 03:46:03 Like I'm trying to do a rocket powered missle launched from a train, and it just... floats after leaving the barrel and does physics when I also try to nudge it with the barrel
general 2023-03-15 15:10:05 Does this game support VR and is Roblox VR in general worth the hassle for a Valve Index?
general 2023-03-15 15:10:50 Lol okay then
general 2023-03-15 15:11:43 That's economics if you got a good teacher lol (perhaps senior year)
general 2023-03-15 15:13:21 "The answer may surprise you!"
general 2023-03-15 15:14:21 But tbh all Highschool is prep for college, if college is not for you then that's fine
general 2023-03-15 15:16:55 For specific fields yes. But yea school really doesn't teach you life skills, they expect parents to teach that
general 2023-03-15 15:17:55 For example, I'm looking into a networking major, and that requires a smaller specialized school
general 2023-03-15 15:19:20 Thankfully because || state|| thinks that is important for the future, if I do well , they'll pay most of the tuition
general 2023-03-15 15:20:52 I'd say everything up to middle school is usefull day to day
general 2023-03-15 15:21:43 *for higher education*
general 2023-03-15 15:22:39 -1
general 2023-03-15 15:26:41 Just ***do not*** forget about +1 when that happens
