plane-crazy 2021-06-08 07:30:40 does anybody know what the fix setting in smoke and snow pipes do?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 08:02:49 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:31:51 jesus fuck the text signs choose what they want to tag and when
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:32:30 understood
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:34:20 yeah i already got that
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:34:28 but what if there is an emoji i gotta use
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:34:36 âš¡
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:34:36 like this
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:35:26 ###
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:36:46 i believe i tried it
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:36:54 it's not supported
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:37:24 âŒ§
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:37:49 i honestly don't know at this point
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:39:12 nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:39:30 ok so i either leave whatever i'm doing without that
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:39:32 or

plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:40:24 i mean not even a plane (<:trollface:775024642104229898>) Z works
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:47:38 not sure if i didn't understand your phrase or you didn't read the fact that all the emojis or symbols i tried are either tagged or not supported
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:49:01 mate the thing that kinda got me mad is that the same emoji i used (âš¡ ) wasn't tagged before but now it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:49:15 and it's not the first time it happened

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:43:19 my friend found this
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:43:21 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:43:27 what could it be used for?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:07 btw the guy that found it is lord
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:18 i didn't, <@!707476805937922118> did
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:33 he says he found it in the bunker
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:36 or facility
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:37 or lab
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:44:43 i dont know that one in the canyon
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:45:04 ðŸ˜³
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:45:34 only rickje and madattak would be able to answer
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:45:56 maybe 2 was used for developing
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:46:04 also i take no credit, <@!707476805937922118> found it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:46:51 but the 2 should be investigated
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:46:59 like what would it mean, what version
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:06 is it some kind of changelog?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:15 minecraft moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:51 and plane crazy is hardcoded so it might fuck with stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:48:34 yeah, i was saying adding an anti flood system would fuck up with plane due to it being hardcoded

im not a dev tho just a thought
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:49:17 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:49:21 think about text signs
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:49:35 they use probably outdated filter due to them being so bad at spotting actual swearing
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:49:46 if rick were to change that his place would probably get moderated
