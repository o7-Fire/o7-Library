help 2019-08-29 17:20:29 hM
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:08:51 did somebody really think they would get banned for a boat with 2nd Reich **Imperialistic** symbols, which don't have much correlation with the Fascist reign of the 3rd Reich
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:16:11 
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:16:17 anyone have any other designs for torpedos?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:18:51 well
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:19:00 since torpedo tubes can't be made
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:19:14 they'll represent both the torpedo and torpedo tubes
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:19:28 and most torpedo tubes are above water.
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:20:25 ?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:20:38 They do go underwater.
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:20:48 The torpedo tube is ABOVE water.

creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:24:56 yes, because it is almost impossible to simulate a torpedo tube without it being big af
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:26:20 but back to my question

creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:32:34 this is the channel I go to when I want to feel disappointed because of my shitty builds compared to these pretty dope ass builds
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:04:00 upload pictures here
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:04:07 and a bot will post it in there
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:04:08 so
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:04:20 no off topic images or you'll be executed by the mods
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:05:25 that's a cash money plane
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:05:27 7/10
help 2020-02-08 03:27:26 help, my TIE Striker keeps making loops
help 2020-02-08 03:28:22 can't take screenshots of the exact build, but here's a reference picture
help 2020-02-08 03:30:04 the blue fucker is supposed to go behind the yellow fucker right
creations-chat 2020-02-09 04:43:53 that ship is thin as fuck
creations-chat 2020-02-09 04:44:19 but it's pretty coolio
creations-chat 2020-02-12 15:10:06 imagine not making stuff from the prequels
creations-chat 2020-02-12 15:10:33 like **bro** the Republic capital ships were pretty dope
creations-chat 2020-02-13 05:19:52 engines, and that motor would cause the boat to turn due to some physics shit
creations-chat 2020-02-14 05:20:23 that's pretty hot
creations-chat 2020-02-14 05:20:40 I'm working on a CIS Heavy Cruiser atm, my own shitty design
creations-chat 2020-02-23 19:15:45 <@!618132044253364325> You need wing-folding and 3x1 or 4x1 delta panels for a plane like the B52
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:13:39 looks like a pretty simple system
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:14:27 bullets are pushed up, the round is pushed into place and then dispensed
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:21:05 I see that, not saying that the system is easy to make
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:21:14 it's just not overcomplicated
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:21:32 anyways
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:22:27 still working on my CIS Heavy Cruiser, *Inertia*
creations-chat 2020-02-27 04:52:13 That mini gun has given me the inspiration to make an M2 B. or a M1895 "Potato Digger"
help 2020-03-02 02:00:49 can someone explain to me the physics of hover thrusters? Trying to test them out at the moment and it's a bit confusing.
help 2020-03-02 02:03:18 alright
help 2020-03-02 02:05:05 there seems to be a certain height limit that is reach when using the hovers
help 2020-03-02 02:07:45 I'm using a 3x3 square, and so far my height limit has been set to around 180ish studs
creations-chat 2020-03-02 02:42:22 do you think I could just use a shit ton of hover thrusters to get my Space Dreadnought to hover
creations-chat 2020-03-02 02:45:48 <@!462077072399925250> but how large was it, fam
creations-chat 2020-03-02 02:46:14 crossbow my ass, that's basically a ballista
creations-chat 2020-03-02 02:49:47 Yeah well mine is the size of most battleships made in the game so not sure if I'll be able to make it with hovers
bug-reports 2020-03-03 04:18:40 
bug-reports 2020-03-03 04:18:45 please fix this shit. It's so annoying.
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:40:38 There's a problem with creations and creation chat these days
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:40:54 It used to be "wow, nice job, you're doing well even if you're a beginner"
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:41:05 and now it's just fucking mass-downvoting.
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:41:24 Seriously, the shit I see that is downvoted isn't even that bad.
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:41:55 Yeah, and there's a point where those high standards are too much
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:43:04 We should be enjoying builds and critiquing them, but there's a point where you're just being an insensitive prick. People need encouragement.
creations-chat 2020-04-09 04:58:10 how the fuck does **BIG RING** get 19 upvotes and 2 downvotes, whilst a legitimately good build of a Cessna gets 3 upvotes and 9 downvotes
creations-chat 2020-04-20 17:40:44 Nice stuff
creations-chat 2020-04-20 17:40:51 very epeec
help 2020-06-21 21:45:16 alright I need help
help 2020-06-21 21:45:45 should I use Option A: shorter, provides more room for building, however it's sharper
help 2020-06-21 21:45:48 
help 2020-06-21 21:46:32 or Option B: Longer, however rounder and more similar to the F22's actual nose?
help 2020-06-21 21:46:34 
creations-chat 2020-06-21 21:51:40 yo, should I use a shorter nose for my F22 (however it is sharper), or use a longer nose that is more rounded?
creations-chat 2020-06-21 21:51:58 I've got the two examples in <#478584971670454284>
creations-chat 2020-06-22 00:10:32 that's *hot*

creations-chat 2020-06-22 21:48:53 I went through 6 different designs until I settled on this sleek design
creations-chat 2020-06-22 21:49:40 I could try fitting it in
creations-chat 2020-06-22 21:49:47 however this is mostly a showcase model
creations-chat 2020-06-22 21:50:03 I don't intend to add too much, however I will try to make it capable of flight.
creations-chat 2020-06-22 21:50:21 Thanks

general 2020-06-22 23:02:35 I guess some prebuilts are epic, like NZXT's BLD computers, but aside from that I'm not a big fan of prebuilts, especially budget ones.
general 2020-06-22 23:10:34 <@!529454050039693314> He's talking about in game speakers
general 2020-06-22 23:10:53 not actual speakers. . .

plane-crazy 2020-06-22 23:14:51 Uh, quick question, how would I access the private servers?
general 2020-06-23 02:03:56 I looked at the Wikipedia article for the I-I War and the first picture I saw was the USS Stark, so that's the only way I know it.
general 2020-06-23 02:04:04 It was struck by an Iraqi aircraft attack

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:31:24 true gamer moment.
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:33:00 apparently using one of those contraptions with suspension, an anchor, and a motor going really fucking fast, you can get launched, despite being anchored, and have the game read that as going that fast, I guess.
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:34:06 
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:37:11 apparently using one of these badboys with this amount of suspension springs literally makes you disappear
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:41:28 ay stuck in an infinite void
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:42:31 anyone got a faster speed?
