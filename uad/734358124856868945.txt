creations-chat 2022-06-20 21:03:15 how this for a A7
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:08:41 how is this for a A-7 nose
creations-chat 2022-06-20 21:15:50 i just started it
creations-chat 2022-06-22 12:23:56 ...
i didnt have much space as i was making it mini but atleast it doesnt have as much exposed lock as my spitfire
creations-chat 2022-06-22 12:26:08 the piston is used for the aerial refuelling probe and i tried to get the springs off the wings
creations-chat 2022-06-22 12:28:14 i need to piston to extend the probe
creations-chat 2022-06-22 12:30:45 if u dont like then thats fine but u cant tell ppl to remove something that u dont like as others may like it
creations-chat 2022-06-22 12:33:59 thats defo true and i want to keep it as i like it
creations-chat 2022-07-03 22:18:49 how is the start of my AH-1
creations-chat 2022-07-06 22:20:07 ?
creations-chat 2022-07-06 22:23:07 ? its a ah-1
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:24:44 basically everything i make is "shit" acording to the creations -_-
creations-chat 2022-07-06 22:25:10 so
atleast i tried to make a helicopter which works
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:25:49 i spent a lot of time making my ah-1 for it to be downvoted bc it looks ugly
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:26:46 i tried my best
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:26:51 thats the important part
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:27:12 its acually my first helicopter that u made withouit a tut to work
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:28:45 i fucking had enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:31:23 i may not be the best but it doesnt mean that it is fair to critisize on other ppls builds just bc ui dont like it
if the buyilder likes it it doesnt mean they have to delete it bc u dont like it
for example: my a7 refueling probe. i like the feature but others told me to deleted it and i still have that probe bc  i like it
fair enough if u dont like it but it doesnt mean its right to critisie others builds constantly
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:31:50 true
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:32:10 but its not fair on the builder who probs spent hours and days building it
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:33:27 creations and creations chat
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 22:33:56 if u doint like u dont like it
but what im trying to say is that someone probs spent hours and even days making it
creations-chat 2022-07-06 22:37:10 no
bc i like it bc i tried to make it realistic
creations-chat 2022-07-06 22:39:22 do i look like i give a fuck
no i fucking dont
<@456226577798135808> its a ah-1 cobra not a ah-64 apache
