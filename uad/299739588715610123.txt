creations-chat 2020-10-21 07:14:12 Well then..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 11:41:56 Can anyone explain to me why motors sometimes spawn oriented in the opposite direction that they are placed in build mode from, and is anyone else experiencing bombs exploding before engaged / released?
general 2020-11-01 07:30:04 its under the wing
general 2020-11-01 07:30:45 where on youtube have you been
general 2020-11-01 07:31:00 oh that side
help 2020-11-01 07:34:34 does anyone know if literally anything is happening with game updates of any kind
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:05:00 does this look okay
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:06:08 How so please explain
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:08:40 Its not supposed to be based off anything really
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:09:54 The nose can be worked on, but specifically whats wrong with it like the design or paint ?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:11:41 The legs help it direct itself in the water, and the engines are actually part of a design of a russian seaplane, those are not my designs..
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:13:08 Yes, it is an ekranoplan, and thats because the one that was made could never fly. Im simply asking if it looks alright as a flying seaplane
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:15:11 <@!422347528688762880> its still in the caspian sea, and its literally just a flying version of that. im not trying to get into specifics of history with you i literally just want feedback on how it looks not how it logically operates.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:16:20 okay can someone who knows what feedback is help me then
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:18:11 I prefer doing it my own way instead of copying designs, sorry
