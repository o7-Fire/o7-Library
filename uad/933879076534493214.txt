plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:01:37 magnets should work
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:01:43 im tryna make a cannon
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:02:58 im trying to launch a powerful bomb and disconnect all the tnts and then explode it killing anything in its path
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:03:21 it might not be possible
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:04:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:04:20 good to know

plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:05:08 time 2 build it
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:05:39 ye
plane-crazy 2023-06-14 15:05:48 + that increases the chance that the cannon blows itself up
help 2023-06-15 13:09:19 my blocks are completely still and dont move
help 2023-06-15 13:09:58 no idea when i launch my cannon
help 2023-06-15 13:10:02 the bomb doesnt move at all
help 2023-06-15 13:11:18 that doesnt change anything
help 2023-06-15 13:11:24 nor does setting it to physics change anything
help 2023-06-15 13:11:59 here's the cannon in its current state
help 2023-06-15 13:17:56 i think its a roblox issue
help 2023-06-15 13:20:16 actually i fixed it by replacing one of the cylinders with wing panel
help 2023-06-15 13:20:17 O_O
help 2023-06-15 13:20:23 idk why that worked
help 2023-06-15 13:20:37 but yeah its def a roblox issue
help 2023-06-15 23:29:55 wdym
help 2023-06-15 23:33:00 it was a roblox issue, the block thought it was still anchored even though it wasnt connected
help 2023-06-15 23:33:05 unanchoring it fixed the issue
help 2023-06-15 23:35:57 why
help 2023-06-15 23:36:04 why would that help
