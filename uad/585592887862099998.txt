creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:01:22 Just because your build got downvotes doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s bad. It just means that others didnâ€™t like it that much
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:03:53 They wouldnâ€™t like it because you used a half ball for the nose instead of making one. You also used very thick wings. And you made the engines more of a cube instead of circular
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:06:07 And the paint job is a bit messy

general 2022-11-17 19:03:08 So basically
general 2022-11-17 19:03:13 A small sphere is hung by a string from the ceiling of a van. When the van is stationary, the sphere hangs vertically. However, when the van accelerates, the sphere swings backwards so that the strings makes an angle of (/) (thats the closest to theta I could get) with respect to the vertical. Find the acceleration of the van when (/)  = 11.6Ëš
