creations-chat 2020-08-23 01:24:23 > Make it stable
<@!608204785384030208> thats what im asking help for
help 2020-08-23 01:27:14 the center of weight and center of flight are pretty close but when i fly its still unstable
help 2020-08-23 01:30:10 > Is this in a plane or a heli?
its planned to be an all terrain vehicle (land water and air) but the flight portion is intended to be plane-like
help 2020-08-23 01:41:08 the centers' relation are about the same as one of my other vehicles that are stable,
help 2020-08-23 01:50:55 the centers are really close but the plane is very unstable
help 2020-08-23 01:51:09 bruh
