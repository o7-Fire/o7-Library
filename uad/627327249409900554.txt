bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:22:39 i found an issue with cuters. if you blacklist someone and they ram intoyou it does cuting damage as well as they fling you
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:24:19 also another random bug is that sometimes the wing flaps stop working with curser
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:24:28 they still show animation but no going up or down
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:28:30 so not likly to be fixed?
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:29:22 tried that
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:29:27 even reolging game does not fix
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:30:20 did not work
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:30:28 its not keybind
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:30:35 is mouse as of rn
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:30:50 ive even restarted my pc and waited 24 hours still nothing

bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:32:21 it worked perfectly fine before
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:32:29 and its with all my planes
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:33:29 also another bug which idk if its just me but that game freezes about every 5 mins and it forces me to restart pc
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:33:43 not pc but game
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:34:10 it only happens on plane crazy on roblox no other roblox game or normal game does this

bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:34:47 it just freezes and sound plays on loop
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:35:01 itsw done this for about a year now with dif accounts and pcs
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 18:37:14 are cutters still ment to do damage when you blacklisted someone?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 18:39:04 but are they still ment to do damage if that person is blacklisted bc for me it becomes an issue first off there seems to be a bug were somethims even when blacklisated the cutter still can hit me and also it makes it were they cant get to my internals when they dont hit me back
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 18:39:12 bc they can fase through and still do damagew
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:40:48 it does this on every pc ive used
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:41:00 and ive tried this on about 4

bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:56:47 I’ve even tried reinstalling it on a dif ssd
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:57:03 So there would have been no trace of the previous one
bug-reports 2020-12-20 18:57:25 And also it’s only plane crazy I have this issue on no other roblox game or any games in that matter
bug-reports 2020-12-20 19:01:02 the website

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:09:41 will the map ever get an extension?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:52:21 brings the game to a crawl missles completly frozen for a solid 5 mins for everyone
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:52:51 made it unplayable for everyone in the lobbie
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:53:19 i doubt anything can be done sadly so i guess ill just have to live with this person using lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:55:56 no its using compression methodes
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:56:07 its millions of blocks in it
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:56:19 i norm get 400 fps roughly
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:56:33 its not my pc lagging
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:56:46 i go down to like 200 fps but it crashes the server
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:57:09 thats low for me
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 00:59:31 is it possible that people on plane crazy get banned or is that just the discord they get banned from?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 03:49:44 im having issues lately were i cant use missiles or fireworks if i move at all. like they just disappear but if i stay perfectly still then they work
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:47:43 im having an issue were i cant shoot any missiles if im moving
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:48:05 i have to be perfectly still or missiles dont shoot they just disapear
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:48:23 this has been happening for about a week now and its starting to get really annoying
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:49:08 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:49:23 20
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:49:30 if im moving at all it does this
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:50:03 i do have a vehicle in my saves that has convayor but im not using it
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 19:50:23 but my norm vehicles that dont have convayor dont work either
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:01:18 https://imgur.com/a/0IDuCWN no conveyor just alot of thrusters in this one
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:02:31 i legit havent been able to defend my self in about a week now with anything but guns. explosions dont work of any kind
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:06:28 anyone else having the missile issue ?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:07:11 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/820386058654711919
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:07:24 cant shoot missiles if moving at all
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:07:31 or fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:07:40 or tnt blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:08:19 it been an issue for like a week now
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:08:22 ive tried everything
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:08:33 ive made a whole new plane and still issue
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:08:39 ive reloged
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:08:44 ive tried everything i can
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:09:05 ive made a turret which litterly just turns and it wont work
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:09:18 i have to be completly still with an anchored block
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:11:12 can you guys tell what this is? (also it uses conveyor but not to go fast just to be silent and small)
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:11:25 
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:13:11 i hope this issue gets fixed soon its soooo annoying
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 20:30:24 im going to have to take a break the plane crazy until the rocket glitch is fixed, i could just play on non pvp but meh i like a bit of challenge but not so much of a challenge that i cant defend my self
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 23:31:16 how often does rickje fix big bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 23:31:24 also is there a place to report them at
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:20:39 ok so ive been waiting for a month to see if this bug gets patched but it seems to not have, im unable to use any weapons in pvp mode other then guns. like all my vehicles cant shoot missiles (new and old) and this only happens with simple movement, so for example if i use a turret that just rotates then it doesnt shoot any missiles unless im perfectly still. *reposted from <#384021699466756107>*
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:23:35 any fix being worked on?
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:24:02 its been like this for over a month now and it seems every server i join im the only one having this issue

bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:42 nope
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:48 ive tried all my vehicles
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:52 and ive made brand new ones
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:55 nothing worked
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:37:22 ive been fighting with only bullets for a month now
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:11:14 ive restarted my pc many times in the last MONTH
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:11:39 i litterly use an entire new pc on a dif network and still same issue
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:11:57 if i use my laptop i have same issue
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:12:14 no i went to the public library for me
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:12:20 all to test
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:12:48 i have...
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:12:59 ive used 3 dif networks at this point
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:13:05 50-70
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:13:26 no not really
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:13:32 just small builds
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:14:17 some of my creations do have convayor engines.(NOT ALL but this bug effects all builds)
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:15:11 through both chrome and windows installer thing(the windows one stoped so i cant use it anymore)
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:15:20 this happens with turrets that dont even move
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:15:55 ya it works with a dif client
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:04 maybe my save is somehow currupted?
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:07 yup
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:18 Microsoft store i mean
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:37 i can shoot
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:42 just cant use missiles
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:45 or fireworks
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:16:57 i cant use anything other then guns
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:17:06 thats the one im using currently
bug-reports 2021-04-14 03:17:23 the microsoft one needed to update but it keeped failing
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 15:18:59 im a bit late to the <#529858892075761694> message but i do think the cutter should be worked on and made so it doesnt do damage as someone passes through you if blacklisted(cutter does op damage if you blacklist someone bc it does insane damage all the way through)
