general 2022-07-09 23:42:41 rick
general 2022-07-09 23:42:48 will plots be bigger?
general 2022-07-09 23:43:12 <@!217336009455566848> are plots gonna be bigger
general 2022-07-09 23:43:44 how bigger compared to pc1? since you know, buildings and ships and stuff
general 2022-07-09 23:45:53 k but how big will the new plots be
general 2022-07-09 23:46:11 oh yeah
general 2022-07-09 23:46:16 yeah
general 2022-07-09 23:46:23 especially if you build a big arena
general 2022-07-09 23:46:33 and it gets into a different sized plots
general 2022-07-09 23:48:19 so anyway if the plot sizes vary between ppl, let’s say as an example i made a ship that fits in the largest plot possible, what’ll happen if it moves to a smaller sized plot?
general 2022-07-09 23:48:25 yeah
general 2022-07-09 23:48:36 oh
general 2022-07-09 23:48:44 so how big are plots gonna be
general 2022-07-09 23:48:52 cause i might make an arena
general 2022-07-09 23:49:01 richfield coliseum
general 2022-07-09 23:53:48 hoping plot size will at LEAST be 100x100
general 2022-07-09 23:53:52 if not larger
general 2022-07-09 23:53:58 or smaller
general 2022-07-09 23:54:13 rick
general 2022-07-09 23:54:25 have you already planned out plot sizes for pc2?
general 2022-07-09 23:54:42 how big will they be
general 2022-07-09 23:55:22 yes but how big will the plots be in blocks
general 2022-07-09 23:57:32 how many blocks wide will the plots be
general 2022-07-09 23:58:27 we NEED weather
general 2022-07-09 23:58:35 it’d be good for rp
general 2022-07-09 23:59:05 rick how wide will plots be
general 2022-07-10 00:00:10 <@!217336009455566848> how wide will plots be since RN they’re like 51 wide
general 2022-07-10 00:01:48 how wide plots be
general 2022-07-10 00:01:53 m!!
general 2022-07-10 00:02:20 yes but we need confirmation from the man himself

general 2022-08-01 14:17:28 how big are plots gonna be in pc2 compared to pc1
general 2022-08-01 14:17:35 since rn plot size is 51
general 2022-08-01 14:20:30 you mean lettuce garlic sauce bacon tomato?
general 2022-08-07 18:29:13 fuck
general 2022-08-07 18:29:34 oh so it really doesn't censor fuck

general 2022-08-07 18:29:47 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-08-07 18:30:10 noggin
general 2022-08-09 21:18:49 wait so how big will plots be in pc2
general 2022-08-09 21:19:04 k
general 2022-08-09 21:19:13 so if it's 51 blocks
general 2022-08-09 21:19:19 then that'll be like
general 2022-08-09 21:20:23 wait so
general 2022-08-09 21:20:35 does that mean plots are gonna be 150x150?
general 2022-08-09 21:20:58 wdym
general 2022-08-09 21:21:16 yeah
general 2022-08-09 21:21:21 that's how i remember it
general 2022-08-09 21:21:28 but rickje said something about bigger plots
general 2022-08-09 21:21:35 if it's not 150 then we'll see
general 2022-08-09 21:21:56 although 2.5 times bigger would be a reasonable scale-up for plots
general 2022-08-09 21:22:07 we'll have to see when pc2 releases tho
general 2022-08-09 21:22:18 or if rick confirms the plot sizes
general 2022-08-14 01:22:30 i've been playing since 2020

plane-crazy 2022-08-14 01:32:36 i use the same measurements <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:10:44 agreed
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:11:05 although sometimes it gets a little funky
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:11:27 for example taking the height of the m24 chaffee and converting it into roscale gives you 3.6 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:11:35 but the chaffee is like 9 feet tall
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:11:38 not 10 feet
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:11:51 so just make it like 3 blocks tall + a half block
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:17:53 how tho
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 02:18:17 up the shut fuck

general 2023-02-28 13:06:22 or, comparatively, “america just tested the new SUPER f-16!!!!” and then it’s just a futuristic render in the thumbnail but once you actually see it it’s just a regular f-16

creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:24:43 yeah i might try adding more detail on my other stuff
help 2023-03-24 21:52:20 idk
help 2023-03-24 21:52:30 sometimes it’s just needed though
help 2023-03-24 21:52:39 like on an f-22 for example
help 2023-03-24 21:54:03 probably because most people use the guide as a tutorial instead of applying one of the elements from it to some of their own original jets
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:39:03 mainly the tail

the rest looks somewhat fine, it's just all the exposed and uncolored motors in the tail that's the main problem
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:41:09 tbh yeah it doesn't really look too much like an f-16 body now that i think about it
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:45:57 i’d say like 5.5 blocks tall or so
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:48:41 yeah but assuming we’re talking measurement based off of roblox characters being like approx 5 feet tall then 14 feet is around 5.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:48:59 although what scale is this guy gonna build in
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:49:30 yeah since there’s not really a proper way to get the most exact measurements with pc blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:49:49 true
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:50:12 idk what kind of drugs they’re on
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:50:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:56:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:57:28 i mean you could use disconnectors to make it a bit taller but i haven’t found out the height of a disconnector yet
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:58:17 yeah maybe
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:01:13 yeah but roblox’s official one is just way out of proportion

plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:04:59 wait now i’m getting confused
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:05:13 either way 2 blocks is still 5 feet tall
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:05:15 augh
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:06:22 guh
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:08:10 6 blocks length, 2.5 blocks width, idk like 2 blocks height since you can’t get it exact

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:28:51 plus most jet noses are nearly 5 feet wide at the widest point so it’d make sense for jets like the f-15 and others to be 2-wide
help 2023-04-01 17:57:03 you pretty much committed one of the worst sins imaginable in pcc
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:29:39 idk but it might be because most people make them 1 block wide
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:31:45 there’s some exceptions where you can get away with that tho, such as the spitfire, the fuselage is pretty much near 1 block since it’s about 2.5 feet wide
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:35:19 if we’re counting feet even though you explicitly stated studs then it’s 2.5 feet (assuming a roblox character would be 5 feet tall)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:37:21 i think i read that 1 foot was like .92 studs so close i guess?
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:39:28 yeah but tbh it felt like roblox was on drugs when they made that definition (it’d make a roblox char like 5-6 **inches** tall if you applied that definition)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:41:58 no i mean like if you assume a roblox character is 5 studs tall, that would make the character 5-6 inches tall which to me (and probably everyone else) is pretty weird
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:44:41 yeah but even then that’s still goofy
