plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:54:22 i know its ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:54:28 i cant figure out motor locking
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:55:15 oof
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:55:27 no.
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:56:01 i dont like motorlocking, but thats just me
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:01:53 i also made a blackbird...
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:02:17 i know it looks like shit but its fast

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:04:16 accidentally made a super shredderbug
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:04:26 im going to keep what i used to propel it a secret
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:04:28 but
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:04:35 it was completely by accident
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:04:42 i NEVER make shredderbugs
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:05:01 but i got bored and wanted to outspeed a shredderbug swarm
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:05:06 so i made this in like 15 mins
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:06:18 might try to make either a TIE fighter or an xwing
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:10:35 i did
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:10:43 that was the only screenshot i had of it.
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:10:55 i am going to keep its form of propulsion a secret
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:12:21 shredderbugs are bad enough as is
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:12:33 adding the ability to go mach 1 will make it worse
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:54:50 nope
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 18:55:14 ok cool i still said im not sharing it

general 2023-04-06 19:06:42 itw strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:07:10 im thinking of making mouse guided missiles
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:07:20 and using the stuff found on shredderbugs
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:07:25 just to guide a missile
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:07:28 not to shred
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:12:37 hopefully my missiles can be anti shredderbug
general 2023-04-06 19:23:38 oh ok.
general 2023-04-06 19:24:32 oh
general 2023-04-06 19:24:34 ok

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:33:12 wobbling
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:33:19 or just being inverted
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:33:25 the torque is at 1000
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:33:37 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:33:52 whats the recommended amount of torque?
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:35:05 wait really?
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:35:20 im test rn
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:53:07 either or
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:55:43 im trying
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:55:51 to make a guided rocket system
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:56:06 i first thought that a shreddrebug like guidance would work, it did nor
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:57:07 no, its for anti shredder bug
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:57:26 i need to find a way to launch a missile that dispenses a ton of tnt balls in a certain direction
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:57:33 obliterating a shredderbug hive
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:58:16 i will try
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:58:32 i just want an anti everything missile
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 19:58:39 and im either gonna have 2 or 4 of em

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 20:01:24 or i could just put a camera on it
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 20:04:03 IT WORKED
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 20:04:19 (the smoke trail in the distance is my missile)

plane-crazy 2023-06-08 19:57:50 first test flight, might have to use rockets instead of control surfaces. i am going to hide these rockets as best i can.
creations-chat 2023-06-08 20:08:11 heck
plane-crazy 2023-06-08 20:08:43 nope, control surfaces work.
