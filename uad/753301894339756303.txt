general 2020-11-03 21:45:24 <@434843195025653762> when you talk about robux roblox has a bot thatll tag your msgs that refrence the robux and will put <---- scammer instead
general 2020-11-03 21:47:09 <@434843195025653762> heres an example, if you say free robux roblox will replace that chat message with a message that says <---- scammer
general 2020-11-03 21:48:37 Rick did not code the scammer messege its a system implomented by roblox to prevent links and scams

general 2021-01-20 19:43:41 does anyone have any suggestions on how i could make the sort of tear drop that goes from the back of a mig/sukhoi canopy down to the front of the afterburnners?
general 2021-01-20 19:44:53 im having difficulties on how to approach a unique shape
creations-chat 2022-04-04 18:42:49 I would personally thin it down just a tad bit but the proportions & shaping in general look good to me.
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:45:42 I‚Äôm assuming this is the cockpit of a B-2 Northrop Grumman Spirit..?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:37:22 I‚Äôd suggest not attempting to do an ‚ÄúAeveryone‚Äù Ping‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:42:17 Because, the Official PC Discord Server is often very passive aggressive & also very harsh. If you‚Äôre not careful you‚Äôll have some kid screaming at you saying ‚Äúshut up no rank‚Äù just because you decided to attempt to give criticism or said something. I personally love watching <#504436696021204992> because of how toxic people get at one another.

creations-chat 2022-05-19 20:05:39 Is that the classic Toxeed F-16??
creations-chat 2022-05-19 20:07:29 God that thing is a piece of crap, PC would have been better if the Toxeed F-16 was never a reality.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:25:09 Agreed.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:27:45 I don‚Äôt think the wings are even large enough to be accurate to scale?
creations-chat 2022-05-19 22:35:15 Applying this very logic, in theory I could build a 1x20000 beam, spanning the entire map and it would be considered good.

creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:13:15 Orrr you could‚Äôve just started with asking for feedback instead of acting like an entitled moron. As Themor said, you were saying quite a few negative things while acting like you were above everyone else. You never asked for any feedback & that can easily be proven by just simply scrolling up on the timeline. Don‚Äôt try and victimize yourself, especially if you caused it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:56:37 Oh lawd he comin.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:59:32 (If it wasn‚Äôt evident enough.)
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:02:36 Harsenal, listen to yourself right now, you are literally talking about a Roblox PC build. It‚Äôs Plane Crazy, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, besides it‚Äôs literally made of fucking blocks.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:05:53 I agree that it may not necessarily deserve HoF but at the same time you can‚Äôt go complaining about it just because you don‚Äôt approve of the thickness of the ropes. This isn‚Äôt intended to be a 1:1 Scale Replica, so stop acting like it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:35:38 I didn‚Äôt upvote it because it was big, I upvoted it because it‚Äôs clear enough that they put some actual effort and time into it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:37:53 Yet here you are automatically assuming that I only upvoted it for being big yet I didn‚Äôt. It seems a bit un-just to say such a thing when it isn‚Äôt true.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:42:16 You‚Äôre ignoring the fact that you‚Äôre judging people just because the up-voted a creation.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:29:28 Welcome to PC <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2022-05-25 05:43:17 Wait nvm, lol. I was thinking of the B variant for VTOL.
creations-chat 2022-05-25 05:46:58 The reason for the larger wingspan is due to it ofc needing more lift to be capable of carrier based operations and still being able to have a decent range and agreeable payload. And to compensate for the larger wingspan the F-35C utilizes folding wings for a better footprint when storing. Similar to how you would sweep the wings of a Tomcat or the folding of an F/A-18.

creations-chat 2022-05-25 19:26:35 This looks like they were doing fairly good on the front but once they got to the back they just went insane.
creations-chat 2022-05-25 19:28:50 Agreed. ~~It would be kinda interesting though to watch people argue with a 6 hour delay‚Ä¶~~
creations-chat 2022-05-25 21:25:26 Can‚Äôt tell if your excited or not.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:52:27 Damn, this is some true crime investigation type shit right here.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:55:45 It‚Äôs from Just Cause - 3 which isn‚Äôt known for the most realistic of plane models.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:00:58 It seems fine except there seems to maybe be a full pilot model inside the canopy, unless that‚Äôs the actual player flying it, which doesn‚Äôt seem very believable to me for some reason.
And yeah, I agree BM would prove it.
<@707133341454958604> That‚Äôs exatcly my thought.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:07:53 Agreed.
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:35:54 OMG BAN BRO BAN
creations-chat 2022-05-27 07:10:56 Well he was definitely guilty given that he left at 10:00pm, Lmfao. Mission Accomplished bois.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:21:30 Still far longer than yours.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:24:19 It‚Äôs the exact same type bruv, only difference is that the photos are two different sides of the same type, because it‚Äôs Asymmetrical. <@761854427262353408> It even has the same number of turbine exhausts.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:26:45 It‚Äôs a fairly close match, close enough for me. And the number doesn‚Äôt mean model number, it‚Äôs the same as a tail number Id. & The paint doesn‚Äôt mean much either, just has to indicate that it‚Äôs a Union Pacific.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:29:02 Because it‚Äôs an updated variant.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:43:31 Jeffo, I didn‚Äôt ask for your opinion. And I don‚Äôt see how high-lighting my rank is a valid argument if you don‚Äôt even have one of your own.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:46:49 Splitz, build which ever one you want. There the same train, just different variants of the same platform.

I don‚Äôt see why you would try and bring in a separate point of buying different variations of the same model of locomotive, either.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 21:49:13 Bruv, its a fucking train.
creations-chat 2022-06-09 21:34:20 Ayo, someone give me a Toxxed F-16 pic rq.
creations-chat 2022-06-09 21:40:08 That swoosh though‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-06-11 21:36:53 Yeah, we call it a dodecagon‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:24:37 I am incredibly confused by this ‚ÄúTik tok Kid‚Äù, please do tell me this is ironic.

<@401530469952389130>, fr?, jesus christ.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:29:28 No. Piston Landing Gears are horrible, buggy, limited in the designs you can create, etc. The best functional landing gear Imo is a good motor-2, that is if you aren‚Äôt in a buggy server.

You can create a full smoothed out landing gear by using 1x2-1x3 or 1x1 texts to hold the gear together which will allow for you to make a one wide fully flush with the fuselage functional gear, works especially well with small aircraft.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:32:52 Two Words, M O T O R  L O C K .

Sorry for the Reply Ping, <@873696499513561088> Didn‚Äôt realize I still had a selected @reply on you.
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:40:38 Anyways, is there an explanation for why Ritual has labeled these two completely separate aircraft as just different Livery?
(Forgor to include photo üíÄ)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 17:43:19 Eh, I just find it odd that he‚Äôs comparing two completely different builds. That‚Äôs all.
Or just delete the msg Ig.

help 2022-10-05 16:25:54 Been working on an ADF-11 as of late and I've started with the main nose point, and I used some 3-axis pieces of plating to do it, but I'm struggling to fill this obnoxious gap down the center line and it's hard to do given it's not constantly parallel. If anyone has any ideas that would be great.
