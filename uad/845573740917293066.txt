general 2023-03-05 08:35:06 e
the-dump 2023-03-05 08:35:44 does anyone have clorox?
general 2023-03-06 10:05:25 Whoever want to try and win 1.7k dm me
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:08:23 so i made a op boat in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:08:42 literally nothing can take it down
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:09:01 its got explosive armored torpedo nets for subs
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:09:21 and it sits so low in the water that most boats cant take it down
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:09:41 oh and it can also dive and lay minefields just for fun
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:10:03 first to drive planes away, second to block boats
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:10:24 its literally an unstoppable force and an immovable object
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:10:34 people have tried
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:10:43 they even used shredders
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:11:00 i destroy that thing in 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:11:11 you shoot above water, cannot, i dive
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:11:24 you shoot below, also cannot, i have deployable nets
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:11:34 aoe and shredders cannot get past
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:12:00 oh and did i mention it can self destruct because of explosives?
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:13:08 i thought of that. there are rotating blades under nets and outer wall, so your cutter gets cut
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:13:17 you cannot get past trust me
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:13:51 the only way is through things like minefields, and i am not that stupid to drive through one.
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:14:32 there is only one instance where it has been defeated, where a guy used lag and torpedos to blow me up
plane-crazy 2023-03-13 11:15:38 i intend to add aps to top as well, so i can attack planes back
general 2023-03-13 11:18:44 i made op boat
general 2023-03-16 23:14:04 You posted something irrelevant in chat eg. Your build in the meme channel
general 2023-03-16 23:14:28 Worldbox?
general 2023-03-16 23:15:23 A game
general 2023-03-16 23:15:34 The game that was screenshot on
general 2023-03-16 23:16:02 Worldbox is on pc.
general 2023-03-17 11:53:39 woa woa chill do yall even know how hard it is to create a single game??
general 2023-03-17 11:54:02 not you u seem pretty chill
general 2023-03-17 11:54:41 he might yknow
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 11:55:20 i make light battleship lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 11:57:08 nop
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 11:57:21 motorlock them with separate disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 11:57:31 add helium to reduce mass
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 11:57:46 if my stupid brain can do it, so can you
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:13:51 ikr they should be upgrading that not adding another new physics system
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:17:45 yep
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:17:52 replacing more like
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:18:15 i think already happened, because most my vehicles are broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:19:00 boats with 80 flank now become 50 flank, guns get stuck, things break in general...
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:19:17 planes not affected that much i think
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:19:43 shame i specialise in light submersible destroyers
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 14:20:33 when they break they get very hard to fix, so half my fleet is now rundown
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:35:01 add helium
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:35:26 submersibles and heli are essentially same
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:35:52 youre tryna make it move and hover in all sorts of ungodly directions
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:36:39 but why does it not fly? is it because it tilts really heavily, or because its just too fat to get off the ground?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:37:46 waitaminute i think ive seen u before
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:37:54 how else i ask u
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:38:36 whats ur roblox display
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:38:56 idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:39:19 ah then nop sorry
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:40:30 really.
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:40:56 you know you can use nornal panels for the top left?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:41:05 wont stick
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:42:37 nah bruh i flung a full scale german ship
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:42:44 2.5x size of build
general 2023-03-18 03:43:47 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 09:32:10 add more with motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 09:32:49 idc if its a pain to implement, its gonna be the only way you can make it work without glitches and whatnot
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:54:55 ig add superthrusters on the end of blade and make pivoting motor unpowered, or add more wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:55:49 or add a way to thrust without involvement of top rotor
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:56:09 maybe put thruster on back of heli?
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:56:17 that always works
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:56:39 when in doubt, **M O R E    T H R U S T E R S**
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 12:57:06 but fr add thrusters on back to aid with forward momentum
general 2023-03-19 14:00:05 whos castro
general 2023-03-19 14:00:21 nice
general 2023-03-19 14:00:34 he looks like a fun guy

general 2023-03-19 14:11:25 dont be so optimistic

general 2023-03-19 14:12:48 nice plane bro
general 2023-03-19 14:12:55 in your pfp
bug-reports 2023-03-19 14:16:40 so i made smth that can punch through blacklists.
general 2023-03-19 14:19:05 so i made a small scale destroyer.
general 2023-03-19 14:19:23 its pretty good
general 2023-03-19 14:19:30 most ships cant hit it
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:08:17 my boat
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:03:46 whats that
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:04:15 yoo tell me abt it
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:06:15 how that work
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:45:46 boat
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:46:15 no not sinking, just floats like that to avoid conventional boat turrets
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:47:01 thinking of making it into a submersible so i can attack missile ships and subs as well
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:48:51 no idea what ur saying
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:49:00 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:49:22 are you talking abt pitch, roll and yaw?
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:52:43 i have no idea which is which, search it up
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:52:58 vtol, looks better than whatever i made
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:53:20 pitch and yaw refer to specific points of turning
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:55:46 who r u
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:55:55 texan, bad or among
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:56:24 bruh
