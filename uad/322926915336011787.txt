creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:54:26 piston chambering submachine gun, it actually worked.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:56:11 
creations-chat 2020-10-20 17:58:08 it fires like 7 explosive balls, the mag works with a magnet and then once chambered, the piston pushes it into range of another magnet that accelerates it
creations-chat 2020-10-20 18:00:15 that moment when you take a part of a combustion engine and use it as a bullet chambering mechanism, stock pistons are overrated
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 18:05:02 AAAA

plane-crazy 2020-10-20 22:10:05 did you use servos
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 22:10:14 it makes your craft really manueverable
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 22:10:22 and it helps control your craft in case its a VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 22:10:38 I used that on my wings and tail fins
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 22:10:45 ah yes

creations-chat 2020-10-23 00:39:07 designing a triple cannon system for my next ship, it has 45 rounds in total, I have found that folded magazines are the new meta for explosive ball storage
creations-chat 2020-10-23 00:49:55 no money
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:41:25 why have a TNT trebuchet when you can load more TNT into a gun from a magazine using a motor piston
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:46:56 I judge by functionality rather than design tbh
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:48:06 what qualifies as a build you dont like though
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:50:59 I typically scroll past unless the build is so horrendous that I am morally obligated to downvote
creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:15:06 looks good, TIE fighter could use with detailing
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 23:16:09 there always is motor locking
creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:18:06 what confuses me is that people post in <#384025409945337856> to get feedback
creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:19:06 nah bruh, people should post in creations to get validation in their building skill 😂

creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:21:54 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:22:54 designed a triple magnetic accelerator cannon for my Spirit of Fire replica, if I fire it *the correct way* it wont leak out balls. for some reason it doesnt explode in the barrel in PVP mode, which fascinates me
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:23:55 whoa how does that work
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:25:17 oh interesting, it looks like its spooling

creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:25:30 he do kinda have big feet tho
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:26:36 slightly noticeable but it makes the build all the more better

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 22:48:21 most of my builds are before motor lock was a thing so im not affected
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 22:48:52 and I just learned how to motor lock, so my use of it is only for detailing and it isnt extensive

plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:00 when u build computer in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:10 actually its not a computer
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:21 its just a typographical storage cell
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:34 if you wanted a computer go to lumber tycoon 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:51 logic gates are like essential to anything remotely related to these things
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:28:59 storage cells need logic gates
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:29:50 I got a friend who made an 8 bit fully functioning arithmetic calculator in lt2
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:29:55 I helped him build it
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:30:03 it has an ALU
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:30:16 it can do +, -, *, and /
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:30:49 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:30:50 basically
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:00 the output is signalled through trapdoors
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:09 the trapdoor on the very right is 2^0
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:11 next is 2^1
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:15 next is 2^2 and so on
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:25 the output is when you add them all up/convert to base 10
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:31:53 it goes up to 2^7 I think, hence the 8 bit part
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:32:57 the gpu is just math at that point
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:33:03 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:33:04 wait no
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:33:05 its 16 bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:33:11 goes to 2^15
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:33:53 all in all, computers and logic gates are fun to make in roblox games lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:34:11 yeah its just a bunch of logic gates
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:35:20 you could do a system similar to the trapdoors
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:35:29 some togglable thing that can activate pistons
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:35:37 idk plane crazy logic input lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:36:01 what acts as your "wiring"
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:36:11 pistons?
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:36:46 umm
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:36:54 you could use some kind of pink stuff dispenser
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:37:54 basically you somehow merge a piece of pink wiring into your wires by dispensing a single piece of it
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:38:35 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:38:43 how does he not know
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:38:57 ok so how does your pink block transfer 0/1
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:39:19 wait so they move in order to signal on or off
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:39:39 ok idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:39:48 you can use an input unit
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:40:05 where you just have a series of 8 pink parts that move to signal 0 and 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:40:17 ok then 6
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:41:03 wait so it reads from a storage yes?
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:41:20 oh ik what you're talking about
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:41:28 well why have a storage
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:41:36 when you can create a storage
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:42:12 so you need human input of each bit right
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:42:25 what is needed .-.
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:42:48 yes but what is needed
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:43:28 oh so all you have is the input?
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:43:35 and the output
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:44:09 so the cpu is the thing that strings the letters together?
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:44:46 ah so you're gonna need memory
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:45:40 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:46:42 here list them
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:48:37 that will be finnicky
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:49:00 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:49:35 I doubt it will fling, I just think it will need a lot of fine tuning
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:49:53 and measuring would just need some sort of suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:50:04 oh you're at that level
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:51:42 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:52:19 the screen could use a piston thing that elevates your standard pattern
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:52:44 ah I see
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:54:26 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:54:50 ah
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:54:58 you could make proofs of concept for each component
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:55:03 and then assemble them together
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:55:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:55:23 so each concept needs to be very compact
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:55:31 and modular/standardized
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 01:57:14 yeah

creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:40:17 I was working on one, I have the magazine done which is arguably the hardest part cause of the weird shape
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:42:19 I thought about using the disconnectors but I couldnt get the shape I wanted with them, and also im using "caseless" ammunition so I cant really pull back the top much farther without having an uncontrollable burst
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:45:38 I have thought about using springs and arguably it will make jamming a lot less common but the major problem is that its not compact

creations-chat 2021-03-20 06:09:17 Also the round is caseless as the gun is magnet powered so there is no need to eject a spent casing and thus no need for a charging handle
