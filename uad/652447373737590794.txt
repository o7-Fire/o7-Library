general 2020-08-19 05:23:11 a bigger sea is needed
general 2020-08-19 05:23:56 what if glass radars were nerfed
general 2020-08-19 05:23:59 and they didnt work anymore
general 2020-08-19 05:24:26 true
general 2020-08-19 05:25:00 but if glass radar existed, the function of submarines (to hide and attack) would be...useless
general 2020-08-19 05:25:02 its like,
general 2020-08-19 05:25:09 removing glass radar is too much
general 2020-08-19 05:25:39 true, subs can run from mines...
general 2020-08-19 05:26:10 i mean, the only way to hide from a ship with a glass radar is to hide under it
general 2020-08-19 05:26:24 is it?
general 2020-08-19 05:27:36 <@!546223347025969164>  a deeper and darker sea would probably buff submarines, and nerf surface ships with glass radars mounted, although, at least the rosters is fair now, right?
general 2020-08-19 05:27:56 no no
general 2020-08-19 05:27:59 wait what
general 2020-08-19 05:28:04 legacy glass works as a glass radar?
general 2020-08-19 05:28:25 glass material
general 2020-08-19 05:28:27 thats the name
general 2020-08-19 05:28:37 yeah
general 2020-08-19 05:28:43 glass material makes water invisible
general 2020-08-19 05:28:54 therefore is necessary for anti-sub warfare
general 2020-08-19 05:29:55 sometimes, the pvp weapon named guns doesnt shoot underwater
general 2020-08-19 05:30:51 yeah
general 2020-08-19 05:30:56 guns is unfair
general 2020-08-19 05:31:01 when put on a submarine
general 2020-08-19 05:31:04 lmao
general 2020-08-19 05:31:13 i actually make functional torpedoes, simple ones
general 2020-08-19 05:31:26 soviet
general 2020-08-19 05:31:36 THE MORE THE MINES, THE MORE THE SPACE THE SUBMARINE CANT GO
general 2020-08-19 05:32:11 no no
general 2020-08-19 05:32:17 not the more the tnt in a single mine
general 2020-08-19 05:32:18 i meant
general 2020-08-19 05:32:27 the lesser the tnt in each mine
general 2020-08-19 05:32:32 and add more mines with a few tnt
general 2020-08-19 05:33:52 lmao
general 2020-08-19 05:33:55 f

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:36:29 LMAO
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:36:32 overkill
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:36:53 the spiky things are single-barrel secondary batteries
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:37:39 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:37:52 perfection
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:38:13 ultimate counter to cutters is just
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:38:14 lava spitters
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:38:43 what do you think can i do to improve the carrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:13 i added rockets to a few secondary batteries
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:17 and uh
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:19 anti air guns
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:22 as guns
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:49 lmao i added tnt to some weak parts as a self-destruct system once im hopeless
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:39:53 also as defense
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:40:30 surprisingly
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:40:34 i did not add any helium
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:40:55 and the carrier's hull below the waterline lines up quite well
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:41:46 it aint done yet bro
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:42:00 e

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:43:46 i remember trolling some guy
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:43:54 by going half my max speed with the carrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:44:02 he drops the torpedo ahead of my carrier, wanting to hit my bow
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:44:04 I SLOW DOWN
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:44:08 AND HE KEEPS MISSING
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:44:41 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:45:23 that guy got angry for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:45:31 and said "STOP DODGING MY TORPEDOES"
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:45:57 im like, "sorry man, this is pvp, i have to do everything to survive"
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:46:20 he responded, "dude, just let me hit you once"
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:46:44 and then i continued dodging his torps
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:46:48 and then he left
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:46:57 i got my portside hit tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:47:24 and i was listing towards port around like, 25 to 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:47:47 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:47:50 my torpedo is fast
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:48:04 i dont know, since i just drop it from my plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:48:10 but it has a normal propeller
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:48:13 not a small engine propeller
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:48:23 e
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:48:38 150 is slow on the sky

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:52:35 my carrier's top speed is 121sps and it doesnt list while going too fast at all
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:53:13 my carrier's reversing top speed is quite horrible, at 19sps...
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:55:08 anyone here have a ship that can outrun my carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:55:20 121sps top speed, going forwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:55:29 studs per second
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:55:36 i mean, my carrier is large
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:55:45 what is it?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:56:20 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:56:45 lag slows down ships
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:56:55 and makes their SPS speedometer lie
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:57:25 arent parachutes small
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:57:48 LMAO
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:58:09 theres a few secret op weapons in plane crazy

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 05:59:31 imagine if the weight of a build can destroy another build
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:00:06 fun fact : the heavier your build is, the stronger your fling power is
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:00:26 i mean

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:00:51 and can place mines that float up
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:01:09 my only submarine has 2 torpedoes and 2 mines
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:01:31 yes true

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:02:16 and voila
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 06:02:17 a depth charge

bug-reports 2020-10-21 13:17:25 > Due to Ping/client-side lag, if you attempt to damage someone in PVP with weapons (especially guns) the model appears to "freeze" in midair, but the creation itself is completely fine on their screens. I believe this is because when you hit someone on your screen, due to ping you may not be actually hitting their actual position that the server renders and thus bugs out.
<@!568818354060787743> Addition: The model also freezes midair when a part is detached from their build. Not too small, like a single block, but a buncha blocks, like a 5x5 part.

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 12:39:20 just have h o p e
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:21:24 half wedges, not down or up, the ones that take up 1/4 of a normal block, would look good on 3 gun turrets
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:21:34 but i'd say cylinders would look better on 2 gun turrets
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:23:10 up to you
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:23:21 im just recommending blocks for the barrels
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:23:26 whatever your going to use
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:26:36 i mean, he did use wedges on the bow, but its so damn steep, that it looks like he didnt use wedges anymore
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:30:10 O H. whoops, okay, in that case, your all good with the bow
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:31:05 its a skip card
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:31:13 skips the player in the next turn
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:31:51 isnt... isnt block and skip the same
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:32:25 as in the block in "You are blocked from entering this place."
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:32:34 block is used as "you are not allowed to enter"
general 2020-12-18 13:33:42 seems that he has a Shirakami Fubuki pfp

creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:46:17 it does look a little bit short to be honest, it would look better if the ship was longer ((if possible)) or thinner
creations-chat 2020-12-18 13:51:08 oh, huh okay i guess, disregard what i said, make sure to utilize wedges to your advantage, oke?
general 2020-12-18 13:52:29 huh, so thats why his name seems familiar to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:53:19 superstructure could use more wedges
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:53:57 the logic of that mast makes no sense, turrets seem to be... strange
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:54:24 other than that, might be... okay
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 13:56:15 AH

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:48:33 okay question
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:48:42 im about to make a battleship, and all my past battleships were laggy
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:48:50 so i'll be straight forward:
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:49:10 `what makes a build laggy? is it large amounts of motors?`
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:50:12 but what if it dont fit, like, a 3 block space
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:50:34 i do use beams whenever i can
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:50:45 yet my battleships were still laggy...
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:52:28 is that the reason when some mouse-following motors rotate when your laggy, they go out of control for the rest of the time your build's spawned in?
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:53:54 indeed it would be

creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:41:05 I could use some feedback. Anything? Both negative and positive feedback would be useful.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:43:55 Thank you!
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:49:08 I dont think so, but maybe you could help. These are the problems that I think the turret has. The right side (From this angle) is where the motorlock bridge lies.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:51:38 Slowmode exists, forgot to send this.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:09:02 The "what happened" you are referring to the left the of the mantlet is the motorlock to connect the mantlet.

The motorlock to the right of the turret is the motorlock for the barrel of the gun to be in place. A misplaced barrel would be highly uncomfortable, no?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:11:24 I have no experience with hiding motorlocks inside the turret.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:15:08 I want to give my mantlet the ability to elevate and depress, but a function or motorlock of higher level than the ones show on this Tiger of mine, apparently fries my brain. If you do not mind, can you provide a demonstation? <@!587393222855229457>

Maybe I could go to a public server and you can join me.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:18:13 <@!587393222855229457> I understand what you mean. I'll attempt to do so. I'll remind you if I receive difficulties, thank you!

<@!287454032250011649> I'll fix the lengthy barrel immediately, and if you do not mind me asking, what does LFP mean?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:24:24 Did it become any better? <@!287454032250011649> 

Just to clarify, I am still waiting on the LFP. What is LFP? Could you show me a picture of it? I'll make sure to fix it immediately if I can.
general 2021-02-11 16:25:08 I do.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:30:14 Made barrel shorter, and moved the driver's viewport to right (This angle) a single block.

Also made sure to include the Lower Front Plate.
creations-chat 2021-02-11 16:38:14 <@!287454032250011649> Lower Front Plate fixed! How does it look?
creations-chat 2021-02-12 02:26:44 Hey, I made a tiger, this isnt an anime pfp if you ask me.
creations-chat 2021-02-12 14:46:26 Feedback is super appreciated! Anything to improve on my Tiger? That would be very essential for my Tiger, which is final, but if you think it needs improvement, please point it out! I will fix it ASAP and put in as much effort as I can, and if I am unable to do so, I will ping you, and ask for assistance. If you don't want to be pinged, just tell me. 

If you are willing to give me some assistance, or better, a demonstration, just DM me! Im available, and will be for the next few hours. Thank you!

The internet tells me 1 stud is equal to 0.28 Meters,

plane-crazy 2021-02-12 19:53:07 Last time I did a dogfight, it was a 400 sps medium bomber against a 700 sps fighter jet...
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 19:53:48 I know, but somehow my medium bomber can maneuver well.
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 19:54:23 My large as heck wings get torn apart if I don’t keep moving though...
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 19:55:10 That’s quite easy to do for my medium bomber.
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 19:55:50 I understand how fast firework and gun projectiles go, so it becomes quite easy to hit the canopy, the nearer they are.
the-dump 2021-02-12 22:37:49 ICR-1 recoil is almost non-existent.
the-dump 2021-02-12 22:38:40 Agreed.
the-dump 2021-02-12 22:39:04 My favorite sniper has to be the Arctic.
the-dump 2021-02-12 22:40:38 With the right modifcations, will one shot any player waist above. Plus, if you miss a shot, you can fire immediately again, unlike other snipers. Fire, delay, fire, delay. The Arctic seems weak outside, but it has lots of potential, and forgiving with the right modifications.
the-dump 2021-02-12 22:41:41 Shotguns are below average, but the best shotgun has to go to Striker.
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 07:57:14 Mind if someone can give me the RGB for this?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 07:58:19 Thanks, I'll try it.
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 08:00:46 It gives your name in PCC a color, I recommend trying it.
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 08:10:20 Im not sure,

plane-crazy 2021-02-13 17:04:32 It looks like a warship, but both the hull and turret could use a lot of improvement! Put more effort into making it look better, and you'll be rewarded. Use 3d models or pictures of a ship as reference!
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 17:05:53 Are making an existing ship?

general 2021-02-13 17:48:11 Did the Soviet Union just upvote my Tiger I E?
general 2021-02-13 17:48:40 Thats incredibly ironic.
creations-chat 2021-02-13 17:55:52 Colors need work. Good, but could be better! Focus making the colors on the support pillars better. Try making the detail color RGB's numbers nearer to the primary color.
creations-chat 2021-02-13 18:27:18 Looks better.
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 21:32:42 Guy's trying, but not trying hard enough.
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 21:34:01 The old days.

plane-crazy 2021-02-13 21:37:35 Surface Ships are sitting ducks for... not just shredders, but just anything in Plane Crazy.

creations-chat 2021-02-13 23:03:51 I see what you mean.
general 2021-02-14 00:02:33 Someone when their having a party in their house:
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:08:01 While your colors may be decent, a better look would be good! Your superstructure is kinda of missing out on space between Turret C (Second turret from the left). Your hull might need a reshape! Balancing is necessary for a good ship, a ship will not move if it is not balanced. The platforms for the superfiring turrets are kind of blocky, why not make them Cylinders? They'll look better! The turrets are requiring work, but they can do okay on Destroyers! It looks like a Light Cruiser or Battleship, if you ask me.

The secondaries are open-topped, that is quite unique, but in order to make it look better, they also need a rework. Darken the deck color, raise the hull for it's waterline to show a bit, and add more superstructure!

Your journey to make a good build is still beginning. Use ships in <#384025409945337856> for inspiration, ask tips from people or if you don't know how to do something, you can ask people for a demonstation! You can use 3d Models of ships in the internet too if you want a reference! Do not give up hope, Epic. Fight on!

I'm right here too, while I may be improving on Aircraft, I can probably help you on tanks and ships. Especially Battleships, throw them at me.
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:12:04 I'm not actually sure, but I don't give a single heck whether or not it's a joke ship. I'll give feedback whenever possible!
creations-chat 2021-02-14 11:14:24 I sense that this will be an excellent build. Smooth curves, easy on the eyes, keep it up, and it WILL be pure perfection! Keep it up!
help 2021-02-14 11:14:51 Try despawning and spawning?
help 2021-02-14 11:15:01 If not, try hopping out of your chair and then hopping back on.

creations-chat 2021-02-14 16:34:19 Excellent! It’s the perfect shape of a shark, I have no problems with the shark. Keep doing good, and in the long run, you’ll have a build you’ll be proud of in the future. Have a good day!

the-dump 2021-02-14 16:55:08 So if you miss one shot, you can fire another immediately.

the-dump 2021-02-14 16:56:31 Yeah, V5.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:07 You level up quite quickly if you play BR.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:19 You can level up multiple guns at the same time too in BR.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:57:52 But one BR match is lengthy, and your absolutely in despair if someone keeps disturbing you every like, minute.
the-dump 2021-02-14 16:58:17 Which makes MP better for quick matches.

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:20:58 The right speed for a real tiger, turret rotation, traverse and just max speed...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:21:11 Well technically, it broke even when not realistic,
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:21:14 For some reason...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:21:22 But when I went to PVP, I got shredded.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:21:30 In the end, I gave it goddamn TNT Armor.

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:25:32 Im glad I learned how to make ships from tutorials, and actually admitted it was a tutorial.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:26:02 Well, I mean my own standard hull design was derived from a tutorial.

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:27:53 Oh... really?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:28:03 I could give you feedback on your ships, if you want me to.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:28:33 I respect your decision.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:30:04 Thank you!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:30:26 Yeah, I'm completely aware of that.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:30:39 Im working on a new hull design as of now.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:31:30 Ohhh, my bad. I'll fix that in my future ships.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:31:55 I'm planning to make a submarine and a cruiser soon...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:32:07 But medium sized submarines are already laggy...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:36:30 Reacter.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:37:01 I wanna make a ship.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:37:12 CL, CA or CV?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:37:26 Heavy Cruiser? Sure, okay.
creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:44:10 <@!715790423959797783> About the bomber you were asking for feedback for;

The fuselage looks decent, but you can do much better! The wings are excellent, but the engines are wonky. Why not make them cylinders and motorlock wing panels to fill in the gaps? And then slap the propeller engines behind them. The tailwing requires another look, so make sure to give that an improvement!

While your aircraft is good to go, it could use alot more improvement! Keep building, Hartman!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 01:46:17 Goodness gracious, I know how big the carrier is just by looking at the guns. Nothing can fit there except the tutorial plane!

creations-chat 2021-02-15 01:52:27 <@!715790423959797783> The tank you asked for feedback;

The turret is too small for the Ratte, and the hull needs a bit more curves. I recommend adding suspensions too, for better offroad performance!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:15:12 Question!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:15:32 Making it like this is not bad, right? Or is it still forbidden? If it is forbidden, I'll change it immediately!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:15:35 
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:16:52 No, actually, its a custom jokeship. I was bored and decided to flood my old carrier with AA.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:17:14 
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:19:09 The bridge looks kinda awkward and other than the flood of AA, any opinions?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:19:54 Yeah...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:19:58 Superstructure needs work.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:20:23 I was bored and decided to summon a typhoon of AA on my old carrier.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:20:33 That's an old carrier, which explains the wonky superstructure.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:20:44 And I don't have any more space to expand the superstructure to make it better...
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:29:08 This guy thinks he made the USS Montana perfectly. How big can people's ego get?!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:29:25 Compare it to the Battleship RIGHT BESIDE IT!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:31:02 Exactly!
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:44:29 I guess your right.
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:55:06 Thoughts? Other than the open gun, yes, I need to fix that, I want to improve this.

creations-chat 2021-02-16 16:43:10 Superb! The cupola is well done, the viewports are excellent, the bogie wheels and idle wheels are very well designed, and the gradient on the schurzen is just perfect! You have a very good Stug III G, so keep it up, and you’ll be even a better builder, learning things!
general 2021-02-17 01:16:30 Question! Why is there TNT being placed to connect 2 or more multiple motorlocks at the same time?

creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:35:31 <@!550335806196416532> Your carrier is overall decent, but that squarish platform sticking out the hull is too noticeable, making the build somewhat... worse. The colors are decent, the hull is decent, but you have to fix that, like extend it or something. Another thing, your white lines on the hull is too blocky. Maybe you could motorlock a delta wing onto those lines to make them... smoother? Your ramp is too awkward too. Maybe give the ramp's sides some slopes to connect it with the runway or something, instead of the awkward corner. Overall, you can do better, and I know that! Ganbatte, Fajny! (Good luck, Fajny!) (Im Japanese.)

I based this carrier off of the Shinano. This is not Shinano, but a ship based off of it.

creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:33:15 If you look closely beside the forward boiler, the Destroyer (currently what I call is a ZX-Class) has secondary turrets. Just thought it would be a unique idea, as it IS a large destroyer, 15x 533mm Torpedo Tubes (I think), 12x guns, and with AA, what else could be a better gunboat and torpedo boat combination than this???

The question here is, what rooms do I put in the question marks at the bow? The rooms without a question mark, are already filled. 

I know the drawings suck, since their only at google canvas, but I need assistance.

Note, Bow is what's below the "Below runway".

creations-chat 2021-07-18 12:19:39 hey, the enemy wont know what's the camo supposed to do if i dont know what's the camo supposed to do either

<@!723940197456281640> any suggestions on how to fix the paint?
creations-chat 2021-07-18 12:22:33 ah, okay i see
creations-chat 2021-07-18 12:28:56 <@!723940197456281640> how about the hidden secondary battery? as an aircraft carrier, would it really even work and not be weird?
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 12:33:59 okay, there is a twin gun secondary battery below the bridge, and that can be hidden by a wall that closes, as an aircraft carrier, would that really work? 

like, imagine a ww2 aircraft carrier, that has a hidden secondary battery in sorties or whatever battle it may be in, would it even make a difference rather than a visible secondary battery?
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:13:41 question, would torpedo tubes be viable on an aircraft carrier? just like the hidden secondary battery below the bridge, what if i hid a torpedo tube with a wall that closes? 

imagine a ww2 aircraft carrier, would it make a difference rather than an exposed torpedo tube, or would it even be useful in the first place?
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:50:04 i was expecting that what if maybe, a sub or a sort of vessel managed to get close to the carrier? wouldn't it be effective for that? like, an ambush or something, just like what happened in the battle of midway atoll
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 23:55:56 was there even a scenario in ww2 where a vessel got close to a carrier, enough that maybe torpedo tubes would've been effective?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:14 ah i see
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:25 hmm, do only destroyers have depth charges?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:03:31 or did other bigger ships have some too
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:05:44 if torpedo tubes wouldn't be effective on a carrier, (if they dont have depth charges) how about equipping depth charges to the carrier that i just shown?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:06:46 i mean, dont aircraft take time to rearm and switch to another type of ordinance, hence why i think depth charges would be useful in some sofrt of way?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:08:06 wait, they were?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:14:00 last question, how important ***ARE*** secondary batteries on an aircraft carrier? would it be viable to get rid of them for extra space for something else? 

what i think is, it always stays away from combat, striking from afar, so what use would a secondary battery have if it cant even reach the opponent in the first place?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:19:10 of so like, dual purpose secondary guns?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:29:43 so, what if i swapped the secondary batteries for, lets say, more planes? how would that affect it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:33:35 i see
