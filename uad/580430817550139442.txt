creations-chat 2021-09-19 17:14:24 what camo should i put on the f-15 im working on
creations-chat 2021-09-19 17:16:25 i want to do the israeli camo but i know theres god knows how many of those things
creations-chat 2021-09-19 17:21:28 idk i feel like it just looks like a messy bowl of expired rice in the front, too much detail, maybe theres a little bit of symmetry but its just kinda overload
creations-chat 2021-09-19 17:23:33 try less color deviation and maybe try chopping a little bit of the depth off (lock the motors or something idk)
creations-chat 2021-09-19 17:25:52 yeah i think that does a lot better, and like i said try less color deviation so it doesnt look as messy still
and yeah what ship is this
creations-chat 2021-09-19 18:11:08 IT ISNT DONE YER....

creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:01:05 play nothing, ok
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:08:34 am i not wrong when i say his build is just another medeocre pvp proud boy tank with some shitty gimmick to keep you from shitting yourself to sleep, like seriously im just bored and im gonna hate on and on and on and on about this tank
straight up he watched a madvulpen showcase video and thought he could just make some green box with a german flag and some details on like one part of the tank with a bulky ass  "tow" missile on a worthless turret that looks like it doesnt even have any elevation so it might as well just be a green toaster-shaped target for planes
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:13:31 im just hating on things to ridiculous extents so i can level up to ACTUALLY POST SOME OF MY BUILDS

wait shit i can
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:17:19 since youre a white name or whatever quirky funny relatable term you guys have my builds are probably worse than *yours* but ill share some i know are better than shitty wheraboo "tow" missile carrier
<@!712219827564970036> (basically just an f-15c nose)
heres my garbage f-15c project:
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:22:47 is this a wierd setup

creations-chat 2021-09-24 02:48:35 guys which one do i make, checkmate or felon
creations-chat 2021-09-24 02:51:56 jk, mig 31, some guy posted on creations and reminded me i was going to build one
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:24:34 im j!@#ing off to this (this makes me want to make a mirage 2000-5)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:27:41 n o, mirage 5, screw my f-15 project
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:31:25 i personally use the detached main pilot seat control mode because its like keyboard but way smoother and uses your mouse, honestly its still satisfying to kill stuff in 3rd person (think of it like motor 2 mouse controls in first person, but nobobdy uses that)
        almost all of my custom fighters use it but i use it wherever i can for planes because its so goddamn smooth
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:33:34 i dont like the canards and i want to make the two seater one (mirage 5 unless im terribly wrong)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:40:26 SAME, i specifically like the f-15c in desert storm livery, im actually working on that rn, here (the paint and detail is really bad right now but you know its only like 1/10 done)
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:42:28 what do you mean

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 23:49:01 alright now that i think about it i dont like the coleoptere
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:49:54 yeah nothing special going on i just added the intake's notch at the bottom
also, should i keep going back and make the engines+elevators or start making the wings+hardpoints?

creations-chat 2021-09-25 00:26:36 guys im super stumped right now on my plane crazy endeavors should i continue my f-15 or should i branch out and make a mirage 5 or a mig 31?
<@!324272487074365451> i figured i would branch out because i saw a lot of stuff i was really passionate to make after i got stuck on my f-15
creations-chat 2021-09-25 00:29:43 no, i meant MY f-15
creations-chat 2021-09-25 00:34:55 no i meant like do something else and build a mirage 5 or mig-31
creations-chat 2021-09-25 00:39:50 i have blood flowing through my man parts from this
creations-chat 2021-09-25 00:53:53 you decide: mirage 5, mig-31, f-15c?

plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:48:13 honestly overrated
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:49:38 "nobody makes super hornets"
meanwhile, the only hornet anyone ever makes
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:53:42 idk i just think its irritating nobody builds the legacy hornet
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:53:53 i have been here for like a month now and nobody has posted one
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:54:24 not legacy though
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 21:59:13 i mean, thats like the one thing besides the cockpit thats different, but i guess thats enough to push away anyone from building it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 00:35:57 f-16, better range more versatility better on board equipment
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 00:37:14 honestly the navy is gonna need a better fighter for their carriers soon

make the nose a little shorter and make the curve on the canopy a little sharper and youre golden
creations-chat 2021-11-28 02:57:36 so maybe have something like this as the canopy
creations-chat 2021-11-28 03:02:27 in the mean time maybe take off the anime pfp ||jk its fine lol||
creations-chat 2021-11-28 03:16:19 the nose is the long part
creations-chat 2021-11-28 03:19:54 thats the photo angle, hes fine ||its also very hard to capture those details||

creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:43:26 it looks sick,
my one critique is that the wings should have a lot more gentle angle in the back (on the front set of wings)
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 05:58:05 "70 pounds and im 12 i could woop ur ass" 
he is severely underweight for 12
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 05:58:56 do you guys think that american planes are built a lot more than other nations planes on creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 05:59:07 because thats what i think
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 05:59:21 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 05:59:28 but i want your take
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:00:04 i think the f-16 can fall into that category too
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:00:39 not as many people build migs/russian planes ~~besides the mig-21~~ than american planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:01:23 jesus christ light mode is starting to get to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:02:07 yes but most of those tutorials are for **american planes**

plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:07:33 is that the one on the f-x
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:07:57 i love crescent wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:08:08 them and also delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:08:20 but specifically triangle delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:08:25 like on the mirage
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:09:23 1. crescent wing
2. triangular delta wing
3. forward swept wing
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:09:25 top 3 wings

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:55:27 half a block grid would be the savior of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:55:46 actually now that we are rambling on about resize
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:55:53 i came up with an idea a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:55:59 but i dont have suggestion rank
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:56:21 all i need from you is 2 trillion in taxpayer dollars
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:58:42 i would steal my moms credit card at 3 in the goddamn morning on a school night for that shit bro
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:59:18 dont blame me, <@!660019099430289418> is the one rambling on about the idea
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:18 true, but...
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:34 NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:00:52 SCREW PISTON LOCKING THE ONLY REASON I USE IT IS TO LINE UP CUSTOM WEDGES
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:01:59 i would first spit on the grave of my dead mother than use piston lock for anything other than lining up custom wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:03:14 off topic but
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:03:29 if your pfp could talk it would say "spit on me"
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:03:55 fine i have a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:04:12 BUT im still not using piston lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:04:47 whatever when we are all playing pc2 we wont be having petty arguments over silly "piston lock"
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:05:52 he has spoken
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:06:21 i am mentally disabled
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:07:00 how much money do you make from plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:08:01 how precise is the grid
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:08:53 i feel really bad for all the hard working devs like you, i heard roblox is screwing you guys over really badly
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:09:33 why not?
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:09:54 holy shit thats rough
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:10:37 rick do you ever have burnouts from too much programming
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:11:17 you are a heat-treated game dev rick, push on please
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:12:25 what are you prioritizing more? plane crazy 2 development or plane crazy maintenence (or do you have a team on both)
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:13:10 are you the *only* one maintaining pc1?
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:13:50 
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:14:59 despite being a parasitic relationship between us too you are answering some very important questions and i thank you so much
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:15:57 was motorlock intended
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:18:31 <@!217336009455566848> will you make it so that we will be able to select 3 points on the grid and make a polygon/face
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:18:49 or something along those lines
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:19:32 no worries, we have 1/4 block grid snap
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:19:59 thats like having a kiddie version of a 3d modelling software
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:20:05 why so?
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:20:13 fair
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:20:44 fair
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:21:09 .25 already allows for a lot of detail rick
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:21:26 elaborate on stretching
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:22:09 
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:23:17 rick i have a last question before i get off your tail:
will there be any sort of guided missile programmed into the game as its own single item
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:24:13 
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:25:05 testing this right now
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:26:17 rick will you ever try implementing a long range guiding system into missiles themselves
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:29:06 wrthb

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:37:53 how, again?
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:38:38 motorlock wont actually be replaced i dont think, it just has too many uses
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 07:39:48 <@!217336009455566848> will the physics engine be updated and more realistic or just reworked into pc2

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:16:17 i like how most of the minecraft content creators are just in their late teens to 20s when their more obsessive followers hound at them to be some bs like "politically active" and "socially accepting"
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:17:12 like bro,
fucky wucky uwu i have a gun in my mouth so i cant speak properly
creations-chat 2021-12-22 03:17:51 the proportions are off but its so cute and sleek i would upvote that in a heartbeat anyhow
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:18:00 thats what im saying
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:18:37 never heard of em, whats it about eh?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:20:29 and they are announced/scheduled?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:20:33 its egregious anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:22:12 so much for hounding at young content creators minding their own business to look out for shit like that
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:22:36 literal masterpiece
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:24:33 ever heard of charles darwin, because thats him in two words
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:29:12 small problem that keeps everyone rolling in bed:

its pefectly legal, and there sadly arent any rules that say your vehicle requires a certain amount of skill to use effectively in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:30:10 truly
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:32:56 ayo

what are your guys' opinions on plane crazys guided missile dilemma
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:33:20 wait what was
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:34:44 hold up, what happened? i didnt even know there was a problem i just know there is a conflict of ideologies on the topic
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:35:11 since the beginning of time
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:35:35 w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:35:50 is it still a thing?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:36:11 we just need ordinance to be able to take up less space
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:37:30 the only problem is that violates all of the basic rules set by the grid and the issue is probably hard coded
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:38:47 exactly, its why i pray to god that we can resize any and everything in pc2 including function blocks like suspension, ropes, pvp weapons, pistons, etc

i just hope the resize works on everything
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:39:18 but isnt that the whole problem?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:40:16 thats so true now that i think about it
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:40:56 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:41:17 so like each build itself has a set grid size?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:41:23 for the whole thing?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:41:57 god i wish rick was here right now lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 03:42:52 i hope it never comes to that

creations-chat 2021-12-31 08:44:25 im not annoyed by that, im annoyed that the only f-18s people build are the super hornets; the f-18c deserves way more love

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:43:30 so does everyone else, if nobody procrastinated hof wouldnt exist
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:43:47 actually thats a lie some people are just really bad at building

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:03:42 hes saying you can become one by avoiding it

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:19:48 holy shit
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:19:50 harold?
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:21:54 im desperate
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:24:06 im scared for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:24:45 because i want to quit unitl pc2 comes out but i dont know how long that is
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 03:28:05 i think im starting to believe in camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 20:31:10 plain crate
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:40:52 this is really technical but
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:41:11 i wonder why all of the american C models of jets are underated
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:41:23 like the f-18c and the f-15c are both really underated
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:41:31 for people who know the difference
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:41:51 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:41:59 anyways

plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:48:07 actually the motor lock is non existant on the parts that shouldnt have it 🤓
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:48:24 whats wrong
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:49:20 pc2 is actually kind of scary if you have a lot of builds with angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:49:58 the resize tool is going to be really nice... unless youre tying to remake your old build
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:50:22 all of my builds will be
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:50:55 also there is no way rick is gonna remove motor lock because he realizes how detrimental it would be for the whole community
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:51:04 and "omg rick pls fix motor lock"
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:51:18 the backlash would be immeasurable
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:51:38 thats what im saying
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:51:51 let me see
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:51:56 what plane is it?
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:52:39 oh yeah and we are going to have .25 grid snap <:PogU:670373666164572172>
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:52:54 ayo wtf
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:53:31 if i were wise while i was in chat with rick i would have screenshotted the message he sent
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:53:50 it said something like "1 - 0.5 - 0.25"
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:54:12 i wonder when it will come out
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:54:51 send a screenshot
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 02:54:59 what operating system are you on
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 01:28:31 i am preparing my f-18c to fight the hof super hornet copies
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 01:29:49 
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 03:09:42 not good enough for what
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 00:56:30 what i was trying to imply:
-i want to give some variety compared to the usual hof super hornet look-alikes
what i was clearly not implying:
-i want hof
-i want to literally fight any f-18 mentioned in-game for that matter
thank you <@!715148402022678608> and <@!401530469952389130> for having some semblence of a brain
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:27:48 this is actually a good example of why paint can make or break a build, if you see past the oversaturated camo its actually a really solid viggen

<@!310133243028570122> i recommend keeping everything and just remaking the camo or using a different one 
if you want to keep the forest camo, just turn down the saturation on all of the colors
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:30:07 true, but thats very lock intensive and we dont know what it looks like unlocked
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:36:12 what he said 🤓
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:45:31 no dic
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:45:33 no balls
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:46:08 and probably no buthole because he feeds off of radiation
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:50:32 there is a lot more wrong with the proportions than that:
-spine doesnt level out, it continuously slopes down
-intakes way bigger than depicted
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:54:32 thats exactly what i just said in clear wording, and you failed to do it on your f-5 in game
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:56:15 whats this part before the main wing on the f-5 called
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:56:31 no, the wing part
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:57:45 
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 01:58:15 there is technical name for it im trying to find
creations-chat 2022-01-06 01:59:46 dont worry its fine,  just kinda wierd when it looks more like an f-11 than an f-5 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:08:23 no, this is an aerofoil

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:36:37 leave the discord right now
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:36:55 you will get unrealistic standards for your build quality if you look at creations for too long
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:39:11 ok i exagurated a bit
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:39:19 what you actually want to do is:

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:39:39 not chat in creations feedback
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 02:40:46 that doesnt combat my points

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 21:46:52 not to barge in or anything but i would be hyped
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 21:47:16 at least theres a chance its faking good news
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 21:48:12 and not pressuring us to figure out if its fake so we dont have to worry if its real
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 21:53:27 can i see front pic 🥺

plane-crazy 2022-01-08 02:44:43 not that you asked, but i defend it because some poeple dont have the time or patience to make their own build and enjoy the game with

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:08:10 of course
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:08:29 if they removed motorlock plane crazy would loose at least a quarter of its usual playerbase

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:25:20 bro wtf is my gif section
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:26:53 how do i improve this
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:27:03 the landing gear ruins the whole plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:28:16 lmao nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:28:19 but about the mirage
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:28:21 can you help
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:30:01 if i motorlock the nose it looks short af trust me
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:30:53 not to hate on you but i personally hate when planes can maneuver like that
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:31:50 here are my 2 reasons off the top of my head (nobody asked lmao)
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:32:15 1. its overly competitive and ruins the authenticity of being a plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:32:34 2. its not challenging
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:33:55 bro if someone does that i hope they fall off a flight of stairs and snap their neck all because you went to the place STRICTLY MADE FOR BLOWING UP OTHER PEOPLES STUFF and want other people to be friendly
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:34:11 wait so like gjsolo pilot seat glitch?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:34:47 yeah thats what i use just really low pull speed because i prefer a brutal amount of realism
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:34:53 and no
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:35:03 its not a coverup for bad maneuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:35:49 kinda fun juking badly tuned oversensitive planes and shredders with a straight flight path
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:36:30 it works consistently too
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:37:44 they are oversensitive and have average pilot ages of roughly 8
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:38:17 wait what does <@!619312093962829849>'s a-10 look like
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:39:01 simply skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:39:12 idk bro free maneuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:39:25 whats the point of maneuvering if your weapons already do?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:39:45 🤓🤓🤓🤓
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:39:58 sorry that was my impression of myself
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:40:02 not meaning to dis
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:40:26 then how did obama do the funny war crime with the exact same setup 🤷‍♂️
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:41:11 so it was a metaphor
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:41:20 i thought it was an actual a-10
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:41:48 i hate ace combat's effect on the plane crazy pvp meta
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:42:20 and also the planes from ace combat because theyre all the same 4++ gen or "experimental 5th gen" bs
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:43:04 yes but what i mean is the amplified arcadeyness
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:44:17 and sure its a video game but the differences between ace combats traits vs plane crazy have been tainted so much into plane crazy its made a new species of "mach 5 turn on a dime sweat-jets"
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:44:33 nah youre good chief
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:44:42 now im on a crack effects rant
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:45:29 might just upload my mirage unpainted then repost with livery
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:45:47 why so

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:47:43 btw a-10 slants down not up
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:47:59 no not even that part
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:48:03 the thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:48:27 god damn your pfp is tight off topic
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 02:49:09 i thought it was komi

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:01:12 sorry not in creations feedback since i have it muted
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:40:43 not to be overly critical but
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 21:41:11 would be nice if it were less like the cookie cutter unedited gameplay montages
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 22:22:29 tried to hide the landing gear on my mirage by exagurating the bulge but it just looks off to me, what do you think/what can i do?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 22:38:00 can i get help with this though
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 22:38:12 or am i a stickler
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 22:38:49 no what i mean is
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 22:39:22 i want the rear gear to be level with the front, but it would be above the wing and ruin the smooth angles with... a box

plane-crazy 2022-02-10 21:04:34 not really and there isnt a 3d replacement
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 21:05:12 both are too small
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 21:05:38 and you cant camera lock anything to put a bevel on the 1x2 "cutter" shape
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 21:06:48 after making the whole build?
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 21:07:01 i dont even have a skill issue thats just ridiculous

plane-crazy 2022-02-10 22:06:24 interesting flight characteristics
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 22:08:14 and tons of ordinance?

the-dump 2022-02-19 22:22:40 people on the internet are too opinionated
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:22:45 it wouldnt be useful
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:24:31 never expose motorlock thats all i can say
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:24:54 for example this build has no exposed motorlock
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:24:55 
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:24:57 but looks like this
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:25:02 
the-dump 2022-02-19 22:25:30 btw camera lock is the most efficient way to give your build something extra

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:09:16 >wide range of children misguided by indirectly malicious content creators and trends
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:09:48 because theyre a wide range of children
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:10:54 i have friends who are as young as 14 who think roblox is targeted towards people younger than *them*
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:13:10 i met this kid named xX_Levi_Ackerman_Xx who looked like a slender and couldnt spell
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:13:15 i thought slenders were like
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:13:27 angsty middle schoolers
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:13:36 but no
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:13:41 theyre elementary schoolers
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:14:15 my best guess at his age was at most 7
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:16:08 in the end
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:16:49 i fully believe it was the younger demographic that pushed away older teens i.e. 18 to as young as like
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:16:50 13
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:17:46 give or take,
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:17:59 he had something like this for the airframe
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:18:15 it was a "well built" plane with some meaningless motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:18:24 he called it a "phantom"
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:18:41 and when i asked him if he saw the real plane he said he "didnt watch the google"
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:19:45 it looked more aligned with a u-2
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:19:59 cant blame him, he was like 7
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:21:02 i would kill a fleet of them for a reeces pieces
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:22:45 (no recollection of the state of yemen)

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:25:01 so then you recognize yemen
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:26:02 thats why i call the mq-9 the wedding bomber

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:28:33 then i wonder, what about
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:28:37 a few months later
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:28:58 when no more "omg pc2 out"
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:29:29 good
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:29:38 that game might as well be academic

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:34:11 meanwhile:
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 00:40:10 point of political interest 😎
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:36:34 so it can actually drive with motors and suspension
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:39:53 because if the wheels were flat it would bottom out too easily
it has to be like that to drive
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:42:04 no, thats boring and lazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 01:18:06 im just waiting for creations-chat to get deleted

plane-crazy 2022-03-24 01:20:04 none of them have things in recent memory to back their bickering
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 01:21:45 thank god hars and his numbnut possey are too busy in creations-chat

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:40:13 its all coming together
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:43:14 could say the same about you
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:43:22 jkjk
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:43:42 i know, but i had to simplify for the sake of productivity
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:44:38 yes, but i removed the bottom slope upwards
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:45:26 is your brain fried buddy
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:45:37 i know
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:45:42 it has to be that steep
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:46:35 then ill be happy to have your downvote cause im not doing anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:46:47 camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:46:57 no?
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:47:23 camera lock is more simple though
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:47:28 just harder to understand
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:47:38 just a camera
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:47:51 camera doesnt have to be connected to anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:47:55 too bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:48:05 more than camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:48:33 with angle lock you need to build the scaffolding for the motor which can lead to exposed motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:48:56 not on smaller builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:50:18 yes but when you have a 1 wide plane fuselage you cant hide motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:51:12 not when theyre only half a block thick
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:51:30 not when theyre behind and above your wing
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:51:41 yes, which makes it harder to hide motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:52:07 its only half a block thick
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:52:17 theyre gonna show
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:52:52 what, under the landing gear?
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:53:43 then the back would look fat
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 22:00:18 not like that though
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 00:11:44 welp
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 00:12:12
