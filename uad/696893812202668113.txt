bug-reports 2021-01-15 00:34:52 There is this glitch for the hover thruster engine where they work fine but then the build freezes mid air randomly and causes your building to plummet to the ground, after that happens you you cant turn the engines on again and your character starts moving like he is lagging hard

bug-reports 2021-03-23 09:11:42 My mates jet is perfectly fine when he is on the main seat that is anchored
bug-reports 2021-03-23 09:12:16 As soon as he goes into the pilot seat in the jet to Vertical stabilizers a glitched
bug-reports 2021-03-23 09:12:33 And the canopy part
bug-reports 2021-03-23 09:12:58 And when we unanchor the block the jet starts having a mind of its own
bug-reports 2021-04-06 01:39:40 Anyone else getting that camera thing for free cam
bug-reports 2021-04-06 01:42:01 Also i cant sprint for some reason, even though i have shift lock off

bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:19:17 Honestly i hope the fireworks are fixed
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:19:39 Because if you shoot too many or get FPS Lag then they will kill you
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:31:38 Of course its the physics engine lol
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:32:26 Bruh why does roblox feel like the cyberpunk trailer
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:33:02 "In 2021 they called my game the most unusual, in the world"
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:33:06 "Problems?"
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:33:46 "Bottom rock rate of updates and more spam bots anywhere than any other platform"
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:33:58 "*Theme plays*"
bug-reports 2021-04-13 09:34:14 "Cant deny that its all true"

bug-reports 2021-04-13 20:07:28 Like the time I was playing with my mobile friend and he got it shortly before being kicked
bug-reports 2021-04-14 06:39:03 Bruh why TF do i feel like when rick updates the game, the roblox engine will keep fucking up to the point where its just the same
