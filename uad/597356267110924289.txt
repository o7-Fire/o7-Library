general 2019-11-28 02:29:55 I just. Accidentally saved over my best creation with a stupid bus.
general 2019-11-28 02:31:19 Is there a way I can revert this...
general 2019-11-28 02:31:27 Please.
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 19:19:52 A?!!?!?
general 2019-12-01 23:31:51 
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:31:34 I wish there was a larger build plot so we could actually make trains that have a bunch of boxcars.
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:02 I cant
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:05 Because
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:12 IT SPAWNS ON DA TRACKS
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:32 It wouldn't spawn correctly on the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:38 If it folded
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:53 ???
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:32:59 I guess that makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:33:02 Thx!
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:33:15 Time to make the mother of all trains!
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 11:22:08 <@527849759898337283> ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 11:23:41 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 11:24:03 And it would be nice of you to let me sleep. Its 5 AM in the morning for me.

bug-reports 2019-12-20 03:45:33 This glitch is very bad because it duplicates how much of everything you can place, including weapons.
general 2019-12-20 08:58:34 Aight who pinged me
general 2019-12-20 08:59:39 <@314383347214319616> well the Easter egg is very annoying. Is there some way I can turn it off?
general 2019-12-20 09:00:32 ... I just scrolled up and please receive christ
general 2019-12-20 09:34:23 The reason why I used I incorrect format is because I didn't know who was the causing it.
general 2019-12-22 00:40:22 So, I was using a mech I made whenever the "Easter egg" happened where the thrusters go hubwabwabwab and it was so loud it made my ears get some weird burning sensation.

plane-crazy 2020-04-17 18:04:19 How to I put in a suggestion?
bot-central 2020-04-17 18:07:32 &suggest can you do something about normal pvp? The only way to fight others is to just build a basic car with all weapons on it, because that's what most others are doing as well. I want to be able to actually have fun in your average pvp server.
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 19:00:38 Huh.
general 2020-07-07 02:29:13 How do I submit suggestions?
