plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:20:09 I’m new to motor locking and holy moly does it help a lot with building my 1998 subaru impreza 22b (I’m trying to go with the rally paint job which explains the random yellow)
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:22:50 at first it reminded my of the detail you would see on a star destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:25:07 oh damn i dont have my designer role anymore
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:38:08 do you have any specific types of builds in mind?

general 2020-12-10 20:22:08 The fact that people say fuck more then the letter a
general 2020-12-10 20:23:12 grammar correction keeps hunting me down 😔
general 2020-12-10 20:24:29 for me it’s hard to determine if a counts as a letter or a word
general 2020-12-10 20:24:47 but a is also a word

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 21:07:44 I use to dislike seeing that but now I think I’m starting to like it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 21:08:28 I think I should have the wheels out a little more for that build though if I’m going to have a slammed look
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:54:22 Ik I was just asking if anybody else was familiar with it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:55:06 But thanks for the info if anybody else wanted to know
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:56:53 It looks alright on a Subaru Impreza 22b for me as long as it isn’t too far out
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:58:50 wouldn’t be smart to have a chamber while using the car for what it is  <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>

creations-chat 2021-02-06 18:30:58 I was just mentioning it so people could understand the first picture. But thanks for the upvote
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:36:20 Yeah you’re right
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:36:45 Is there also any chance I could work on the headlights?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:37:18 What would you recommend to make the hood like that?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:38:06 First let me hop on and see what I can do
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:38:27 Plus the interior looks like crap so that’s gonna have to be fixed for me
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:40:45 If I were to make the build bigger then it would be easier for me to do so
creations-chat 2021-02-06 18:50:31 Thanks but I do need to make the hood curve down a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:01:38 I see
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:01:54 But the grill shouldn’t be that tall along with the headlights
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:02:40 Wait hbu I add you and you can show me in game
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:02:45 So we can compare
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:05:49 Feed your missiles 3 meals a day  and put it to bed at 9:30 PM every night and make sure to show it some discipline if it misbehaves

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 02:00:53 Does anybody have any tips for automobiles with rear wheel drive drivetrains? Usually when I have an unpowered motor in the front and a powered motor in the back it tends to turn on its own.

I really love the design! Building a car in the game that can change gears was going to be my next project but I’m wondering if I should use it in a Toyota Camry or Corolla.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 22:00:45 If I see something that people put their best effort on, I’ll upvote it. If I see the opposite of that then I downvote it or just leave it. That is literally what the feedback system is there for. Out of 20,000 people, I’m not sure anybody is going to sit on their cheap office chair from staples downvoting everything they can everyday. I’m sorry for clogging the chat with this long paragraph.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 22:04:33 Lmao you do you nobody is stopping you
