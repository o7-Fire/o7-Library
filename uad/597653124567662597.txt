plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:18:11 You could add guided missiles to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:18:29 instead of just regular ones in the pvp slot
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:16 Yeah, true.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:32 Its good for pvp though. I put it on my fighter and made one witha nd without
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:45 If you wanna snipe ground targets its good
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:55 True.
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:04 But yeah besides that I cant think of anything else
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:10 Maybe a torpedo? idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:46 My cat just fell lmao

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:24 The only thing I could think of that wouldnt look that akward is maybe a torpedo
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:29 Thats not the tutorial one im guessing right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:24 ok nvm its not
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:34 Its definately not i just looked at the tutorial a-10
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:41 the jet engines look like crap on the tutorial one
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:24 Is there any room for jets or propellers on the inside of it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:48 You could possibly use helium
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:27 eh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:28 I mean,
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:38 I honestly dont care if I use helium blocks as long as it looks good
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:41 But usually I dont
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:46 The only thing I would add is a torp.

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:17 wasd is steering the ship
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:22 arrows are for steering the planes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:45 The planes dont have bombs, and i do count it if they had to detonate bombs

creations-chat 2020-06-10 02:11:40 <@!564633856184156161> for the back of your bomber try putting pistons on the symbol so you can paint the smaller part of the piston white instead of an entire block, that way the symbol looks better
