plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:48:47 ^
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:49:14 no they are literally boxes
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:51:01 not as bad as modern ones
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:52:31 i think your thinking about the sides of  some modern tanks which are a little bit more flat than the ones in ww2
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:53:31 just find a work around
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:54:26 doesnt mean its modern
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:54:35 its just used
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:57:26 i mean we can simply end the argument by just accepting the fact that some tanks in ww2 are boxy and some are not, same does with modern ones but idk its yall choice
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:58:06 well my bad i'll stfu about it
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:59:05 wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:59:14 until it looks like a boat idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:59:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:00:11 use the 2-3 ones
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:00:20 basically use the longest at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:00:33 then you slowly decrease the wedge sizes
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:01:38 ah
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:02:03 yeah it is actually hold on
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 11:02:10 its better to show than to type it out

creations-chat 2021-12-27 16:46:12 sadly that theres no space for the mq101 under the wing and that arsenal bird cant fly without the help off the gravity slider but it can fly if i put more time into it and its 4900+ blocks

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:44:52 what you can do is use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:45:35 oh

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:46:42 wait

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:47:57 
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:48:05 basically motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:48:13 so that it can merge it nicely
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:48:31 
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:50:00 
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 14:52:42 oh uh
