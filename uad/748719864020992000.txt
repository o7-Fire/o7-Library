general 2021-02-04 05:14:42 69
general 2021-02-04 05:15:32 Do you guys know the song Lose Yourself To Dance
general 2021-02-04 05:15:40 That's from random access memories
general 2021-02-04 05:16:06 Guys come listen to ram
general 2021-02-04 05:16:19 ;-; why not

general 2021-02-05 21:05:46 
general 2021-02-05 21:07:54 I would make an ekranoplan in this game but the ocean is too small
general 2021-02-05 21:08:28 <@315262125113081856> stop being cringe
general 2021-02-05 21:08:37 It would be useless
general 2021-02-05 21:08:57 It would cross the ocean in 4 seconds
general 2021-02-05 21:10:53 Well there are a lot of things in this game that dont exist but you can always simulate them
general 2021-02-05 21:10:57 
general 2021-02-05 21:11:11 It looks fuckin wicked but it's too big
general 2021-02-05 21:12:08 The little yellow thing is an excavator
general 2021-02-05 21:13:46 It's actually not a plane, it's kinda like a hydrofoil boat
general 2021-02-05 21:14:36 I'll just recreate cosmetically
general 2021-02-05 21:14:49 Do you know how hydrofoils work
general 2021-02-05 21:16:52 Ok so, some russian guy thought "why not lift the hydrofoil wings out of the water" and you get this massive ship that uses ground effect to fly right above the water at massive speeds
general 2021-02-05 21:17:29 That's how aerodynamics works
general 2021-02-05 21:18:11 Thrust increases lift when you use a wing because bernoulli's principle x2
general 2021-02-05 21:18:53 But more lift also means more drag so

general 2021-02-10 18:35:05 Let's say you were locked up in a box with a bomb. The bomb is connected to a single point arrow that is facing both north and south at the same time. At any given moment the arrow is observed. If the arrow points north when observed, the bomb explodes and you die. If it points south, you survive. Are you dead, or alive?
general 2021-02-10 18:35:55 Another interesting thing to note is that this can lead to the creation of alternate realities
general 2021-02-10 18:36:06 When the arrow is observed it leads to the creation of 2 realities, one in which you are dead, and one in which you are alive which is the one you will be living in after it. You can keep on repeating the experiment, and you will never technically die in your reality, you will just create tons of alternate realities where you are dead
