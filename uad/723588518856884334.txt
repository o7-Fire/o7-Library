general 2023-07-14 01:09:46 You know what I wish that's the game could add is steam engine parts and prefabs and thing of a gigs because it would be awesome because I'm trying to make a steam engine but I can't because there's no steam engine train Wheels I can't make big wheels that work on the tracks the turn tracks keep derailing me if my train wheels are static and if I try to attempt to make a steam engine it usually has to use a stupid swivel wheel that does not look great and it's design and plus it doesn't have a boiler I have to use the cylinder pieces which looks so bad sometimes like please add some steam engine related pieces especially drive rods and drive Wheels like please I need that because I love creating steam engines but it's really impossible when there's no parts for a steam engine

general 2023-07-14 01:11:48 <@636996526878490624>  bro I don't know what you're saying you can't make steam engine Wheels switch tracks will derail it and plus the tracks are not long enough for a full-fledged standard 
gauge railway
general 2023-07-14 01:13:07 Also and how the heck do you make train cars that were the train wheels don't have power
general 2023-07-14 01:13:30 Like is this chat full of toxic people
general 2023-07-14 01:13:54 You know what if I created a better version of this game I'm going to make fun of all of you fools
general 2023-07-14 01:14:09 Because there's a thing called karma
general 2023-07-14 01:14:41 Like a I'm a 17 year old and it's really rude that you're basically acting like I'm a child
general 2023-07-14 01:15:09 My brother in Christ you are the dragonborn
general 2023-07-14 01:15:50 It's a thing called watch Russian badger and you'll understand what I said
general 2023-07-14 01:16:55 I like how I had a suggestion about steam engine parts and then people start to degrading me like I am part of several groups and they never treat me like this

general 2023-07-14 01:19:11 God you all are queers
general 2023-07-16 23:40:11 Do you know what playing crazy shut at is steam engine parts that would be amazing to make steam engines from real life as well as having the tracks longer that go towards the canyons and all the way to like some of the areas that usually don't have a track that leads there because I want to try to see if I can try to make a train that goes to those branch lines
general 2023-07-16 23:40:23 ?
general 2023-07-16 23:41:03 <@697893501274161325>  freaking attack me one more time I've had enough of this I can go to a better server that can actually do better than this
general 2023-07-16 23:42:08 It's technically bullying cuz you were basically making fun of my scientific brain and that steam engines would be amazing to the game especially bigger Wheels and those stupid switch tracks can be fixed because I can't even drive with static Wheels
general 2023-07-16 23:44:44 <@158294656113836032> hey madattak could you at least add steam engine parts because all these people in the chat are being really rude and I just wish there was steam engine parts because I want to build steam engines but people are so rude and disrespectful that I can't even put a suggestion in without people bashing me five seconds later continue to fix the switch track to make the tracks longer because every time I used to take Wheels the train derails every time when I built the northumbrian and let me tell you that train does not work with switch tracks.
general 2023-07-16 23:46:50 You know what this entire community is toxic as heck I'm going to literally tell everyone never to come to this chat if I ever have any friends who want to join this because I want this thing to be dead because everybody's so rude like being nice for once in your lifetime like you have no father if you're going to act like that to everybody especially me when I want to be creative!!
general 2023-07-16 23:47:41 <@697893501274161325> okay quit being rude I do not use subreddit Reddit is gay
general 2023-07-16 23:48:18 You guys will be sorry when one day is steam engine parts become actually useful for crazy inventions especially the steam powered vehicles and planes and you'll be sorry that you've crossed me for once
