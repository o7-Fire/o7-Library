plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:24:49 If I sit in your plane you have no need for ballistic blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:55 What does the speed on the blast blocks do
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:31:12 Is it how hard it needs to be hit to explode?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:32:20 The ughhhhhh

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:34:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:35:05 I assume it's how hard it needs to hit something to explode
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:36:01 I don't know if that's correct but that's what I assume
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:36:27 Like the max speed it needs to smack into something to blow up
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:36:47 Anyone know what impact speed does
