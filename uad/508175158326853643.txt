general 2023-02-10 07:40:26 yes you would lol, get formula or a related formula that uses the same variables and solve formula
general 2023-02-10 07:44:26 lol the variable names are included in a formula those are just shortcuts
general 2023-02-10 07:44:42 acronyms
general 2023-02-10 07:46:07 youre expected to know that on a test sure but these names can be substituted for the real names and still make sense.. the shortened names arent a signature part of the formula
general 2023-02-10 07:55:42 this particular question is lol
general 2023-02-10 07:56:12 find formula or formula with all variables
