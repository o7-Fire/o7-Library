creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:15:17 So I can just post my creation here?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:15:53 Unfolding aircraft carrier with anchor blocks so that when someone lands, it doesn't spasm
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:16:09 Unfolded
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:16:30 2,025
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:17:03 I have two creations that don't fly, but look kinda cool
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:19:20 Also, I replicated one of the planes from the thumbnail
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:20:14 I know it isn't hard, but it helped me understand more of the physics and how plane builds work in the game
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:20:26 Because I could reverse-engineer the plane
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:20:34 oh jesus
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:21:06 I like the green bit at the front. Is that to resemble a targeting system overlay?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:22:11 I wish you sat a bit higher in the seats.
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:22:45 I'd rather it be a quarter of a block
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:23:40 You did really good work on the body
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:24:10 I'm not an expert on wings, but maybe use some 1x2 delta wings on the front near the intake?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:30:23 Hmmm, That does look like a cool addition, but I meant on the main wings. have it sweep from a 1x2 long-ways to the 1x1s
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:30:49 But that is a good addition
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:31:07 Since there were no elevators
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:32:02 like this
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:33:00 I forgot that all pictures of creations posted here go to the creations channel lol
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:35:33 Part count for the carrier
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:36:02 I tried to add an arresting cable to the carrier
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:36:30 I'm gonna try again
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:50:46 One of my friends just told me that he made a magnet propulsion system. has this been 'invented' here yet?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:50:58 oof
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:19 lol
