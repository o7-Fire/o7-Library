bug-reports 2021-01-16 16:39:22 So I spawn in my Toppat Airship after going to another server, I load it in, and its missing a lot of blocks, like,  A LOT of blocks, is there any way to fix this or do I have to put all the blocks back every time I go to a different server?
creations-chat 2021-01-16 17:14:48 Yeah but I'm tired of building for like 3 days straight ;-; (It also has over 6500 blocks so it pretty laggy)
