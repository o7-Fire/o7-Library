plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:19:28 my save data rn is "34734"  i dunno what rick meant with 25000k like did he mean 250.000 or 25000 im assuming 250.000
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:20:00 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:21:28 il delete old creations just to be sure
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 22:21:08 okay so this is not a shredder bug this is a WIP Devourer of gods from terraria calamity. problem is i have no idea how to make it fly in Zero Gravity anyone got ideas?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 22:21:33 y e s
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 22:22:05 so how do i make it fly in zero gravity without it goign all over the place
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 22:24:59 <:whynot:757462155909005523> noone helping me figure out how to make my devourer of gods fly
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:28:08 not the best but my devourer of gods phase 1 is done
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:28:10 
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:39:38 w o r m
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:39:52 yeah old sprite since new one is too complicated for blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:39:55 and wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:43:10 comes with speakers‚Ñ¢Ô∏è blasting the theme for phase 1 and 2
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:44:20 y e s
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:44:30 DoG theme is the best
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:45:33 i might make him longer
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:45:52 double or triple the size hes now
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:45:56 to fit the actual one
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:46:04 l o n g  DoG
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:46:33 i think long boye would lag or not fly well but idc L O N G   I T   I S
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:50:44 add cutters to the front and my Devourer will be able to devour ~~gods~~ poor creations
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 01:51:20 i wont add cutters unless i wanan flight some other worm
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 05:41:15 so a few hours ago i finished my Devourer of gods wich is a Long flying worm boss from a terraria mod. its kinda short since the build limit of the chunk and i forgot how to get a worm to fold properly without breaking the moving segments
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 05:41:30 can aynone help me on making the Devourer l o n g
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 05:45:25 its currently maxxed out at 50 blocks length
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 05:58:54 the
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 05:59:21 (so dose anyone know how to connect moving segments without breaking them i wanna make my devourer longer)
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:04:11 thats a big boy naval turret
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:10:27 im still craving for the answer on how to use building folding with motors on moving parts without them breaking
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:11:18 allright
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:36:02 im really bad with folding soo is this possible to fold without leaving a floating block somewhere?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:37:09 share your knowledge with me
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:38:43 cameras leave the motor floating on the side
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:39:21 im trying to achive a seamless fold that dosent leave a random floating block
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:40:05 the distance in the picture is the max i can go going any further would stick it to the first part
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:40:47 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:40:52 is the air gap
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:41:03 the 6th block would connect to part 2 of the build
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:51:30 is is a fold possible with a 5 block gap
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:52:16 i tried camera fold but it didnt connect right
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 06:55:24 aww
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:01:30 i wonder if there will ever be a bigger building plot
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:02:40 damn
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:03:41 nice
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:08:51 ***Lmao***
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:10:07 is
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:10:07 man that dude
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 07:10:11 MEGA BRAIN
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 21:28:53 i managed to fold my devourer of gods
its like 100 blocks long now
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 21:46:28 i probably wont spawn in my L O N G devourer of gods too much since 100 moving segments going 500 speed lags the server sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 21:55:49 how to i keep the folded motor from opening again without using toggle since toggle makes my segments spazm
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 21:56:54 okay
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 23:58:37 Big boye Devourer of Gods
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 00:22:03 <@!688199362207416485> yep its from calamity
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 00:22:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 00:23:12 we have half blocks but a option to build with very small blocks that can attach to each other would add so much detailing
bot-central 2020-10-01 00:58:43 !help
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 00:59:33 wanna know what would be awesome?
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 00:59:45 the ability to remove the "TNT" decal from explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 01:00:11 would make bombs look better
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 01:06:16 thank you

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 06:45:06 Motor ***ACEND***
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:38:47 i told some kids with OD avatars that they are annoying for using shredder bugs with speakers blasting youtube 2012 tutorial music and now they are threatening me and reporting me for "bullying" lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:39:49 "i looked at the rules and there stand no provoking u are reported"
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:39:50 lol

plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:42:42 "you are bully reported"
***SPEECH 100 by FacuLoucims and Nodecostopper***
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:42:48 they deserve a award for that
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:43:17 they are bragging that they read rules and that it says "no provoking"
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:43:21 bet they dont even know the tos
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:43:38 they false reported anyways so they did break a rule on their own lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:44:01 "annoying people" is on the roblox tos now i guess
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:44:15 bruh they annoy people daily with their shredders
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:44:16 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:45:28 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:45:43 toxic 5 year olds false reporting and threatening me
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:46:03 yep
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:46:11 threatening to mass report me
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:46:24 for "annoying and provoking"
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:47:10 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:47:36 ***SPEECH 100***
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:48:17 also did i mention their shredders have speakers that blast that weird annyong tutorial music
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:48:28 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:48:54 bruh they have stuff like candyland playing
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:49:00 ROYALTY FREE MUSIC
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:50:20 yep
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 22:55:35 they are litteraly inuslting me
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 23:00:21 baiting shredder armys to propellers by flying under the propeller is a 100% foolproof way to murder shredders
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 10:42:35 is it possible to add eyes n mouth for my warthog as deco because ***ive been trying for way too long but locked motors arent my friend***
bug-reports 2020-11-07 13:28:51 sometimes people can kill you while your in build mode via cutters
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 12:29:58 Anything new in the winter update or same as last year
the-dump 2020-12-22 22:55:06 
the-dump 2020-12-23 03:42:42 yo anyone wanna play obama bossfight
bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:17:12 if a server is laggy (wich it often is) impact bombs explore delayed and dont cause any damage 90% of the time. i know this is well known but it makes my missiles useless and i just want some way to have it fixed

so 99% of the time i cant use my custom missiles
bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:41:40 my missile is auto targeting so it really only works with on impact
bug-reports 2021-01-06 18:41:59 move this to dms or general if you wanna discuss this
general 2021-01-06 18:42:36 my auto aim missile is useless since on impact is broken ):
general 2021-01-06 18:42:42 darn
bug-reports 2021-01-06 19:29:31 rip when was the last time you played?

plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:36:51 can i somehow switch pvp servers? i dont wanna get put into shredder servers non stop
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 16:21:24 anyone got a reliable small (max 6 blocks long and 3x3 wide) unguided rocket design that i can strap to a jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 15:11:49 can the "pilot seat" even control anything? like detachers and guns maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 15:12:33 or is it just a normal pilot seat with less function
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 15:19:25 360 - 400 speed alright for a jet or do i need to cram more super rocket engines in
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 11:04:38 i deleted 2 shredder bugs that were chasing my bomber with the turrets and it felt good
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 11:04:56 hitting them in the middle makes them s p l i t
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:30:39 anyone got a good torpedo design that wont float or sink when deployed? too lazy to make my own atm lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:38:30 <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:39:29 turn off powerd and turn on lock and start compressing stuff
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:40:39 U,,w,,U
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:40:50 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:40:50 no

plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:41:19 hejlp
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:41:22 help
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:41:45 ***evaporates***
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:42:23 alr im gonna go through the pain of building a submarine now
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:42:28 then adding torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 22:42:39 my first sub will prob be trash lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:14:54 i dont know how to feel about the submarines nose. might do some adjustments later
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:18:57 the top of the sub seems a bit flat any tips for fixing that?
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:21:25 ?
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:21:36 i want to have internal torpedo tubes
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:21:38 i have a idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:21:44 il make missile silos at the top
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:22:03 the missiles wont steer very well since theres not much space
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:22:06 but still seems good
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:23:56 how should i build the engines
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:24:09 might have to motor lock them in
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 23:36:53 can someone give me tips on how to attach the water propeller to the back properly? first sub ive ever made
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:10:33 its able to sink / float, Turn and move now
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:10:36 time to tackle the engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:10:55 il try to use motor lock to attach it to the back maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:13:50 im doing some changes to the top first tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:13:57 not happy with the tower
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:16:06 it takes practice
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:16:11 this is my first submarine
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:16:25 so im stepping into the unknown with that build
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:18:45 i moved the tower back a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:18:47 looks much better now
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:01 im still unhappy with the back end of the sub
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:06 i need to attach a engine somehow
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:28 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:36 paint job is not final
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:42 il probably make it darker at the top
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:19:59 figuring out subs is fun
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:20:02 you should try it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:21:34 yeah this looks bad il have to use motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:29:20 the engines a real struggle
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:29:24 cant find a way to attach it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:45:31 not the best looking propeller but its all i can do rn
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:46:06 i have no more space at the front for torpedos so idk where to put them now
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:46:51 well
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:46:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:46:57 i could
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:47:18 maybe i can make the torpedos have a small bay at the top that opens up to let them float up
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:47:26 then i can steer them towards the target
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:48:49 i can cram a torpedo into this
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:49:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:59:10 
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:59:10 
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 00:59:17 maybe il put a missile in there instead
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:24:18 the submarine is done! just need to figure out what to put in the bay at the back! since it can only be 5 blocks thick 3 blocks tall and 6 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:26:40 anyone got a design for a missile or torpedo thats only 3 blocks tall 5 blocks thick and 6 blocks long that works for this sub?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:26:47 or should i put sea mines in the bay
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:27:00 i could fit alot of sea mines in there
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:30:34 i can fit 9 mines
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:30:40 so should i make a mine layer sub?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:37:13 my mine layer submarine is done!
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:37:23 it has 9 mines that are 2 tnt blocks each
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:53:39 sure
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:53:45 sorry i was on do not disturb
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:54:05 il add you as a friend on roblox and il join you in game
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:56:58 its not that big of a space
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:57:06 but with motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:57:14 i could cram atleast 2 in there
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:58:55 <@!514333972189151233> thats the size of the bay
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 01:59:46 yep
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:00:01 i need steering on them tho thats why i said 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:00:07 steering takes 2 extra blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 02:07:09 will the new map have deeper oceans
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:07:25 I kinda wanna make a destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:07:34 Ive never made a big boat before
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:07:52 Well i just made my first submarine and it turned out great
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:08:01 So might try it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:49:03 anyone got a torpedo design that wont flip when i deploy it (submerged)
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:49:09 it has to acend to the surface
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:49:14 and be 6 blocks long only
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:55:59 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:59:06 
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:59:08 new paint job
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 03:59:14 looks way nicer
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:05:15 it needs to be controlable
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:05:44 and water propeller is too fast for soem torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:06:35 theese are my current torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:06:52 problem is they go TNT first and flip upside down when they arrive at the surface
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:07:05 they go straight up
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:07:34 they are supposed to stay like that and float up but they flip and go up
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:09:33 they do
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:09:37 but they work as torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:09:43 they dont take off into the sky
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:10:14 if they deploy right i can steer them towards the target
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:18:58 the winter map gets removed march 1st right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:19:16 if yes then thats nice since the winter fog is annoying
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:23:29 nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:34:43 max length is 6
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:34:52 if i wanna make it longer i would have to expand the bay
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:35:06 wich i could but id have to move the engine room and hatch
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:57:38 it flies
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:57:42 pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:57:52 THE PROTOGEN - CANNON
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:59:24 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:59:29 you made a protogen mech?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 04:59:45 **pog**
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:01:58 j9ce
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:02:02 nice

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:02:13 still nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:03:18 protogen tie fighter?

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:06:28 i replied to you once and deleted it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:06:41 that might have been one of the ghost ping
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:07:10 the message was a lenny face to the "the prototonk gets penetrated by a atgm"
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:09:15 it got deleted for zalgo
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:09:23 that might have been the ping

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:17:28 "furrist"
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:17:34 ***"furrist"***
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:17:55 fckin   ***FURRIST***
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:35:01 "calamari" mini torpedos :D
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:35:02 
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:35:07 they work well
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:36:23 its 6:36
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:36:24 didnt sleep
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:36:26 im german
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:36:27 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:52:57 i named it after a squid
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:53:02 but yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:53:05 its kinda a food name
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 05:53:24 its because the top of the torpedo looks like the head of a calamari
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:30:49 do arm on key
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:30:54 or change the keybindings
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:31:12 you know you can use the screwdriver tool
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:36:05 ???
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:36:15 you sure you have everything set up right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:36:31 you cant have anchored blocks or anything blocking the disconnector
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:37:37 put them on "physics"
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:37:41 then it will work
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:37:57 the anchor blocks are keeping the disconnector from working
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:38:02 since they have physics off
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:38:10 also make sure you have wasd on the missiles flaps
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:38:15 for it to work
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:40:19 ground attack
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:41:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:41:22 works too
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:41:44 but make sure to put all other anchors on "physics"
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:42:05 oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:42:11 A-10 is pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:42:20 typhoon is also pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:43:43 oof
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:43:50 dont use control panels for mouse guided
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:43:54 that wont work
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:44:06 use motor 2 and configure it then place wings on the motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:44:44 that works
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:44:53 but put the speed up on motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:44:57 and limit the max angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:45:03 then it will work perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:46:56 sure
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:53:34 i dont think your doing it right
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:53:44 remove the motors at the back
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:53:52 and move the front ones to the middile
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:58:52 a missile should have the right settings and the right form
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:59:05 your missile is just tnt blocks with 4 motors
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 08:27:55 its hard finding pvp servers that have naval battles going on
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 08:27:59 theese are sad times
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 08:30:34 they should add server browsing for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 08:30:38 i wanna be able to switch servers
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:15:45 anyone got a 1x1 torpedo tube design i can use for my next sub? i want my second sub to have front facing torpedo tubes
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:16:22 a functional torpedo tube that i can put torpedos in i meant
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:16:28 ive seen some and i wanna try my own
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:16:34 but i dont know a good tube design
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:16:43 im aware
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:17:19 maybe i can use 0.9 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:17:25 and maxe a 1x3 tube?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:18:02 or i can have the torpedos shoot out the side of the submarine and then steer towards the target?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:19:00 this is my current way of deploying torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:19:05 a bay that can open / close
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:19:25 where the torpedos float to the top and then steer towards the target
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:20:24 yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:20:55 my thought was maybe build small hatches on the side that i can open and launch them from
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:26:58 would a 9 wide sub look bad without folding?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:27:19 i could probably make a typhoon missile sub with that space
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:28:20 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:28:39 il try if i dont manage to do it il just make a folded sub
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:31:45 idk if it will look good
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:31:48 this si how big it would be
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:31:56 could i pull it off?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:32:08 or will it be too short
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:34:42 a nouse would fit and there would be space for 2 floors
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:36:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:38:01 it would look a bit short
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:39:05 my smaller sub looked flat at the top and rounded at the sides but im fafraid that this one will just look like a block
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:39:13 how can i smooth it out a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:43:05 damn
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:43:24 i have no idea how il make this sub move sink or float when  im done with the hull
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:43:26 its b i g
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:44:44 i know what ballast tanks are
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 11:44:52 i just dont know how i will make this big boy move
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:02:31 i will 100% have to make the sub fold
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:02:37 the nose is huge already
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:02:47 il take a nap first tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:07:26 Im just scared that the folded sub is gonna be slow and laggy
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:07:35 Since its like 9x9
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 12:09:58 180 fold or 90 fold for the sub?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:11:46 S M O O T H     S U B   N O S E
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:11:58 i will 100% need to fold this is just the nose
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:20:13 at what point should i fold?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:21:19 how much space is required to fold?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:21:31 1 block wide is already enough right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:22:31 when im finished with the body il arm it and decrate it before i make it able to dive and move
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:22:40 so i can balance it out right
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:22:48 and dont have to adjust along the way
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:27:33 il fold here
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:28:07 where should i start the fold? i the middle or the top/bottom
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:31:51 i meant how high the first camera should be placed
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:32:06 i have never folded a large build only small long stuff
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:33:06 like this?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:35:42 i cant do a seamless fold there
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:35:53 im using the cameras to attach the motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:36:01 to the other cameras that will attach to the other side
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:38:28 also what do you mean wrong discussion?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:38:43 oh wait im stupid
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:38:46 theres a help channel
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:40:19 thanks for the reminder
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:12:51 my sub is already 1k blocks this will be a laggy build
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:16:51 B I G    B O Y
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:09:40 my sub is funished
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:09:48 its balanced and can move
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:09:51 it can dive
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:09:59 it has 2 torpedos that fire from the sides and 1 missile silo
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:10:14 and a bit of furnishing (more to come im just tireed lol)
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:10:24 total block count: 2307
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:29:49 my sub goes like 3 speed underwater
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:29:57 it has 20 super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:00 the power of lag
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:14 thats why i dont make builds that are over 1000 blocks often
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:24 this ones 2311
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:33 it also tips slightly when turning
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:44 but atleast it can dive and resurface
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:30:47 and still be stable
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:33:37 
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:33:38 huge lad
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:35:35 couldnt figure out a good system to launch alot of torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:35:42 so it only has 2 torpedos and a guided missile
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:36:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:36:08 torps are guided
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:36:20 3 explosive blocks on the torps
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:36:37 i want guided torpedos on the side and i kinda wanna make a torpedo tube with unguided ones
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:37:42 i still need a way to put unguided torpedos in a tube
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:38:16 the sub also has a slow turn speed so its mostly just for looks but atleast has some weapons
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:39:28 its my second sub ive ever build
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:39:38 and my first large scale build
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:39:41 go easy on me
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:40:06 i just figured out how to properly build subs like 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:40:54 its kinda hard to make a big sub have great movement
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:41:49 if i figure out how to include good movement  on my sub il balance it out more and add that
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:41:55 the ship looks pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:42:11 and when i figure everything out il weaponize it even more
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:31:09 alright boys wish me luck
im loading in my submarine and im gonna ttempt to make torpedo tubes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 04:17:41 after some adjustments my sub is now 2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 04:18:00 ***i get like 20 fps when its folded and moving at its higest speed***
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:12:13 pyramid wedge 1x2 when? <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:14:21 my sub can reach speeds of 25 now and the turning speed is better too
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:16:22 what map got picked again?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:16:34 the 2 islands right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:16:52 hot
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:17:59 cone wedge when <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:19:54 2 things that would be v e r y   n i c e
are option to remove "explosive" decal on the tnt blocks
and. i forgot what the 2nd thing was while writing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:20:19 someone helped me suggest it
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:20:23 never got looked at
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:21:29 i just rememberd what i was gonna say
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:21:57 ability to R E M O V E    E N G I NE    S O U N D S so i can add my own sounds for the engine instead of hearing super rocket engines go nuts
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:23:31 this would just improve quality so much
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:34:31 what if the new map releases march 1st when the winter map is gone üò≥üò≥
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:34:35 üò≥
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 05:34:44 probably not
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:39:37 someone said 2 torpedos and 1 guided missile was not enough weapons for my large submarine
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:39:40 so i removed the missile
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:39:47 and added 4 torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:39:50 so i have
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:39:57 6 torpeods total now
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:40:04 i have space for 4 more torpedos but im lazy
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:40:18 and all the torpedos are guided OWO
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:43:39 i can
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:43:49 i already have one
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:43:59 im deploying torpedos from that silo atm
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:44:17 the missile version of the sub has a missile in a silo
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:44:21 the silo can open / close
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:44:39 the sub brings my fps down to 5-15
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:44:44 when im launching torpedos
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:44:48 i have a high end pc lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:45:43 i dont have the exact specs memorized
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:46:08 but the graphics card is a Gtx 1650 (not the best card but performs better than most people say!)
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 07:46:10 brb school
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:24:17 would i able to get the SHIPWRIGHT [IV] role for my sub? its still a ship but with the ability to go underwater
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:25:00 dose a submarine count as a ship?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:25:09 it applies to all the requirements
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:25:21 it just a lil slow since its 2507 blocks big already
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:25:57 nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 09:26:09 do i film evidence that it can turn n stuff

help 2021-02-26 11:47:29 after looking at the 3d model of the destroyer im tryna make i have realized that i cant make a stealth destroyer ***too complicated for me***
help 2021-02-26 11:47:47 so can someone give me a new idea for the shape of the side?
help 2021-02-26 11:50:47 new strat: im just gonna make the nose of the ship and build from that!

help 2021-02-26 12:26:27 its 2 blocks high
help 2021-02-26 12:26:38 and theres no 2x2 wedgeblocks
help 2021-02-26 12:27:25 oh wait im probably supid

help 2021-02-26 12:34:44 F
help 2021-02-26 12:44:09 how far should i go up with the front?
help 2021-02-26 12:48:20 its already getting too wide
help 2021-02-26 12:51:18 one more block up and it will be 21 blocks wide
help 2021-02-26 12:51:33 im starting to think that this is gonna be a battleship instead of a destroyer
help 2021-02-26 13:16:36 how long should it go up for
help 2021-02-26 13:17:28 rn it goes 5 blocks up
help 2021-02-26 13:26:37 like 2 folds
help 2021-02-26 13:26:38 maybe
help 2021-02-27 00:11:18 will i have to remake the nose of my ship again? its getting really wide and i wanna have it not be 20 blocks wide
help 2021-02-27 00:11:32 ideal would be like 13 or 16 bocks wide
help 2021-02-27 00:12:11 and the nose is only 5 blocks high and i wanna have it go up a little more
help 2021-02-27 00:12:58 oh yeah
help 2021-02-27 00:12:59 sorry
help 2021-02-27 00:13:13 let me take a picture of the current bow
help 2021-02-27 00:13:40 
help 2021-02-27 00:13:56 i might have to remove some of the wedgeblocks at the front
help 2021-02-27 00:14:22 i want it to look good on the build when its finished
help 2021-02-27 00:16:29 more like a lemon
help 2021-02-27 00:16:48 yeah il remake it to make the very tip be not as flat
help 2021-02-27 00:17:55 how many blocks should it go up for
help 2021-02-27 00:18:04 so it dosent look like its half submerged
help 2021-02-27 00:18:35 i meant how high up should the ship go
help 2021-02-27 00:18:51 yours goes 9 blocks up
help 2021-02-27 00:19:03 doing that right now
help 2021-02-27 00:20:06 alright
help 2021-02-27 00:20:22 il work on the bow for a little bit and then let you judge how it looks
help 2021-02-27 00:20:40 my plan is to use wedge block then 1x2 wedge block and move up instead of having it all mixed up
help 2021-02-27 00:22:00 alright
help 2021-02-27 00:25:23 would this work better?
help 2021-02-27 00:29:52 or should i cut out the 1x1 wedgeblock
help 2021-02-27 00:32:47 im going for a destroyer or a cruiser if a destroyer is too hard for me to make

help 2021-02-27 00:38:40 oh
help 2021-02-27 00:38:47 i have another one in mind
help 2021-02-27 00:39:42 this is also a ship i would love to make soon but i might just ditch the destroyer and make this now https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordrhein-Westfalen_(F_223)
help 2021-02-27 00:40:06 i live in Nordrhein-Westfalen
help 2021-02-27 00:40:26 its a Frigate
help 2021-02-27 00:42:30 it has a 127mm gun and some harpoon missiles. and a anti air system
help 2021-02-27 00:42:51 il build it
help 2021-02-27 00:43:05 it seems like a easy enough ship to start out with
help 2021-02-27 00:43:24 why?
help 2021-02-27 00:44:22 il look for a top view
help 2021-02-27 00:46:02 theres also this from the side. maybe that will help with the bow
help 2021-02-27 00:46:34 do you have any advice on how i should start with this
help 2021-02-27 00:48:37 il probably sit here for atleast 2 hours trying to figure out the bow
help 2021-02-27 00:49:53 the ship isnt that big so maybe i wont need a fold
help 2021-02-27 00:59:26 every time i try to build the bow it just gets really w i d e at the front along the way
help 2021-02-27 01:03:33 i made it pointy at the start and it has devolved back to this
help 2021-02-27 01:09:00 i kinda managed to pull off the shape of it
help 2021-02-27 01:09:08 not the best but looks close enough
help 2021-02-27 01:09:47 the bulge wont be visible. people told me whats under water isnt important since it would capsize if you actully made the bottom rounded
help 2021-02-27 01:10:17 9 blocks wide is alright for a frigate
help 2021-02-27 01:12:45 no
help 2021-02-27 01:12:50 the ship itself irl isnt that big
help 2021-02-27 01:13:16 i cant place any blocks here
help 2021-02-27 01:14:31 that fixed it
help 2021-02-27 01:14:32 thanks
help 2021-02-27 01:19:56 the stern of the ship is a helicopte landing space and its lower than the other stuff so i made it only 2 blocks over the water
help 2021-02-27 01:20:02 its that enough?
help 2021-02-27 01:20:07 or should it be 3 blocks to be sure
help 2021-02-27 01:20:18 im scared that it will be under the water
help 2021-02-27 01:25:42 i just did and il raise it by 1 more block
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 08:31:54 How much the super speed cost?

help 2021-03-07 20:04:35 i know how il build the thing itself but how do i make it rise/sink

general 2021-03-20 15:34:14 A
help 2021-04-05 21:08:14 so i have a missile inside my submarine that starts to wobble alot after a bit of flying it

i made the exact same missile outside the sub and it flies fine there. 

any ways to fix this? or is it just because the sub is big and causes lag wich might mess with the physics
help 2021-04-05 21:11:03 the missile that launches from the sub starts to wobble but you know what? i wanna make my sub fly now
help 2021-04-05 21:12:59 i switched out the super rocket engine with a normal one on the missile and now it flies fine? it used to fly fine with a super rocket engine before i put it in a submarine missile silo
help 2021-04-05 21:13:21 speed + lag + motors = bad i guess
help 2021-04-05 21:21:44 nevermind it still wobbles even after switching the s rocket engine with a normal one
help 2021-04-05 21:22:16 the missile works fine when not inside the sub
help 2021-04-05 21:22:26 but asoon as i launch it out of a sub
help 2021-04-05 21:22:30 it wobbles
help 2021-04-05 21:22:36 so lag makes things wobble?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:01:00 i can never resist the urge to make guided missiles and bombs to slap onto everything i have
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:02:29 you better have a seperat keybind for the bomb to split

i always attach trails to the end of every bomblet and have a key to drop and a key to split
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:02:58 its very satisfying watching the smoke pillars creep down to the ground
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:03:56 i get high altitude 
i drop the bombs
i split them once they are close-ish to the ground
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:04:17 o
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:04:50 every guided bomb i try to make ends up as a missile because cringe drag system
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:05:38 havent figured out a way to not use a thruster or propeller on a guided bomb
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:06:01 use mouse guidance <:troll:230419183479816194>
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:06:10 oh my
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:08:06 add a singular 1x1 delta wing to the side of each bomb and a trail on the other side thats set to Hold (not toggle)
make the key for the trail your bomb key and hold down the bomb key

watch the fireworks

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:12:52 i should really put a few days into learning how to use motorlock for things that arent weapons and stuff like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:13:50 i am more intrested in guided weapons anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:14:05 slap a few motors onto a explosive stick and you got a guided missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:14:31 add some balance to that and you got a better missile!
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:14:41 now notice that its too big and try to make it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:14:47 **break it completely**
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:15:15 **it now wiggles in the air uncontrollably, good job.**

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:29:05 use it as budget napalm
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:29:21 well i put the controls on the numpad

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:29:56 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:30:29 then just use something like "ijkl"
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:30:33 instead of "wasd"
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:30:38 just some random keybinds

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:35:28 man im excited to fly long ranges on big map when plane crazy 2 comes out
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:35:44 no longer will i look down and see the void
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:38:32 what

yea stupid idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:39:59 deployable tank drone thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:41:12 okay oka y wait
2 stage missile that transitions into a functional guided torpedo on the second stage to annoy submarines
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:42:39 okay after i chug 2 more coffees i will try to design a 2 stage missile that transitions into a torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:42:44 probably gonna fail horribly
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:42:59 since i want the torpedo to be able to sink and rise properly
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:43:06 the 2 stage thing will be needed
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:43:23 but how do i fit everything in a small enough space
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:43:52 BOYS lets design funny 2 stage anti sub missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:44:24 has anyone made a proper anti sub missile yet?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:44:50 like multi stage and everything
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:45:50 a booster that delivers it over the ocean and then splits from the torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:46:27 other way around
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:46:36 missile fired from land or ship
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:46:40 wich turns into a torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:48:14 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:48:51 il try to make a torp small enough to fit on a missile and survive a fall into the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 11:58:35 alright time to figure out how to make this multistage anti sub missile light enough to work
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:09:15 im suffering from missile too heavy sydrom with my multistage anti sub missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:14:33 okay wait i wont be able to makie the torpedo detach from a missile body properly so what if i just make the wings of the missile detach upon hitting the water?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:21:34 okay i managed to get the missile to work and properly deliver the torpedo to the water
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:21:40 now i need to design a working torpedo
help 2021-09-14 12:23:44 step 1 to me multistage anti sub missile is done, now i need a working torpedo. this one is absolute trash and just dies once it enters the water and dosent work unless its flat on the surface, i need it to be able to sink and roll properly, any tips?
help 2021-09-14 12:25:15 yeah the back ballast sinks first
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 12:47:13 yeah if anyone could help me on how 2 achive a proper guided torpedo with proper ballast that is compact enough to fit into the anti sub missile <#478584971670454284>
help 2021-09-14 12:49:45 how
help 2021-09-14 12:49:45 well
help 2021-09-14 12:49:53 i cant really do that properly
help 2021-09-14 12:49:58 its attached to a missile
help 2021-09-14 12:51:16 i need it to be able to dive properly though
help 2021-09-14 12:51:46 it needs to be small
help 2021-09-14 12:51:52 and the weight cant be too big
help 2021-09-14 12:51:58 since the missile will be off balance
help 2021-09-14 12:52:23 il try to get it to work with ballast blocks
help 2021-09-14 12:53:51 well its also spinning
help 2021-09-14 12:53:53 wich is not good
help 2021-09-14 12:55:23 fixed the spinning
help 2021-09-14 12:57:27 now the rocket is underpowerd
help 2021-09-14 12:57:38 ballast block on 2 made the nose push down too much
help 2021-09-14 12:59:04 the torpedo works now
help 2021-09-14 12:59:21 but the missile dosent
help 2021-09-14 12:59:27 too much weight at the front
help 2021-09-14 12:59:36 the missile has 2 super rockets
help 2021-09-14 13:02:02 fixed the rocket up a bit
help 2021-09-14 13:04:58 works well enough now
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:06:08 alright it works now! i can launch the missile, steer it over to the water, detach the torpedo from the missile, and then steer that torpedo towards submerged submarines
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:07:04 yup
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:07:19 gonna try to make it more compact on the missile end when i get some sleep in
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:07:35 gonna try to make it atleast fit onto a frigate or jet
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:08:59 if anyone wants it i can make a blueprint for the anti sub missile for people to use after i make it more compact

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:20:37 Torpedo is very slow since it uses a small propeller but it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:20:41 im happy with it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 13:20:51 just gotta make the missile part smaller somehow
