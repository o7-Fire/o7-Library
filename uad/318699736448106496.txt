general 2020-05-11 19:53:49 We need one
general 2020-05-13 14:50:23 WAIT
general 2020-05-13 14:50:25 NOW I CAN
general 2020-05-13 14:50:28 MAKE MY
general 2020-05-13 14:50:29 OWN PUSLEJET
general 2020-05-13 14:50:37 I can make my own pulsejet!
general 2020-05-13 14:50:39 YEEE
general 2020-05-13 14:50:51 wait
general 2020-05-13 14:50:53 why
general 2020-05-13 14:50:53 what
general 2020-05-13 14:51:32 wait
general 2020-05-13 14:51:47 I can make my own pulsejet engine
general 2020-05-13 14:52:18 <@!323414243074506763> That will just make people buy in order to abuse the block
general 2020-05-13 14:52:37 If its free, you can just mute it
general 2020-05-13 14:52:46 Yes
general 2020-05-13 14:52:47 I agree
general 2020-05-13 14:53:19 <@!370594904268734464> why use alts when u can use your own main?
general 2020-05-13 14:53:23 you just pay R$
general 2020-05-13 14:53:32 <@!435864400235200522> How much did it cost?
general 2020-05-13 14:53:38 WHAT
general 2020-05-13 14:53:43 300R$
general 2020-05-13 14:54:16 Plane Crazy is officially P2W
general 2020-05-13 14:54:34 With a speaker block you can do a lot of stuff,
general 2020-05-13 14:54:37 make engine sounds
general 2020-05-13 14:54:41 make cool soundeffects
general 2020-05-13 14:54:52 you need to pay 300R$ in order to have a soundeffect
general 2020-05-13 14:54:59 like
general 2020-05-13 14:55:01 why
general 2020-05-13 14:55:20 A free speaker would be a ton better
general 2020-05-13 14:55:28 It would allow people to be more creative
general 2020-05-13 14:55:55 I was gonna make like a pulsejet engine
general 2020-05-13 14:56:14 but screw this. not gonna pay 300R$
general 2020-05-13 14:56:58 Why not have it like 25
general 2020-05-13 14:57:19 <@!304977711988867072> you can still abuse it with 300R$
general 2020-05-13 14:57:35 To be honest, a lot more people will abuse it because it costs
general 2020-05-13 14:57:51 because they think that there are no riles
general 2020-05-13 14:58:09 Because they pay = no rules. Having it for free = fear losing it
general 2020-05-13 14:59:10 well
general 2020-05-13 15:00:29 <@!162156549978980352> Because they buy it, they think they are above everyone
general 2020-05-13 15:00:46 It kinda is
general 2020-05-13 15:01:15 How am I going to make a stuka now...
general 2020-05-13 15:01:26 How am I going to make a pulsejet...

general 2020-05-13 15:27:46 why even buy the pass if others cant hear you
general 2020-05-13 15:29:33 if they mute it, they cant
general 2020-05-13 15:29:57 yeah
general 2020-05-13 15:30:05 yep
general 2020-05-13 15:30:13 yep
general 2020-05-13 15:30:27 if they were free, that would be a reason for it to have mute
general 2020-05-13 15:30:50 but muting the speakers that you pay almost 4$...
general 2020-05-13 15:30:59 yep

general 2020-05-13 15:31:13 I was going to make a pulsejet and a stuka

I spent hours on mine working to get them to fly perfectly and be combat ready, even trying to hide a lot of the additional stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 14:12:59 Sold your soul to gaijin?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 14:13:42 
creations-chat 2021-12-15 14:14:15 Yeah it's not that easy especially on those planes. Making them hover on the spot is surprisingly hard without putting the hover thrusters under the plane
