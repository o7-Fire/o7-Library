help 2022-08-04 14:40:58 Well 17 if u count the outside
help 2022-08-04 14:45:29 Preferably the littlest I wanna do is 4 but if for it to work it needs to be less missile's I will cope
help 2022-08-04 14:46:31 How many do u think I can fit in there
help 2022-08-04 14:46:38 Cause idk how to make the system
help 2022-08-04 14:46:47 So idk how much space it gonna take
help 2022-08-04 14:49:10 Do u know how to do the guiding and launching system
help 2022-08-04 14:50:42 So disconnect full power and then how do I guide them
help 2022-08-04 14:50:59 Cause I can't use mouse aim cause mobile

help 2022-08-04 19:06:51 
help 2022-08-04 19:06:55 This is the space

help 2022-08-04 19:08:07 Well not exactly I want to make the mechanism
help 2022-08-04 19:08:13 Just yeet them out of siles

help 2022-08-04 19:15:02 It's 3x3
help 2022-08-04 19:15:19 3 blocks on each side
help 2022-08-04 19:20:12 
help 2022-08-04 19:20:23 4x4
help 2022-08-04 19:20:56 Like basically yeeting drones that yeet missiles?

help 2022-08-04 19:25:09 Like I want to
help 2022-08-04 19:25:13 Make them drones
help 2022-08-04 19:25:33 So basically put missiles on my missile
help 2022-08-04 19:25:39 Go close and yeet them
help 2022-08-04 19:26:10 That's what I wanna do
help 2022-08-04 19:26:35 But that still doesn't solve my issue
help 2022-08-04 19:26:48 How will I drive the missile
help 2022-08-04 19:27:44 I will still need to drive it to the target
help 2022-08-04 19:27:47 And idk how
help 2022-08-04 19:27:59 Servos idk how to make them work
help 2022-08-04 19:28:09 And it makes everything much more complicated
help 2022-08-04 19:28:27 Cause i have to manually roll and pitch
help 2022-08-04 19:28:45 And that's more controls on my screen
help 2022-08-04 19:29:43 I cant
help 2022-08-04 19:29:48 For every servi
help 2022-08-04 19:29:55 Even if they both say f
help 2022-08-04 19:30:02 There will be multiple f
help 2022-08-04 19:30:23 Say for example to turn a servo u press
help 2022-08-04 19:30:24 F
help 2022-08-04 19:30:29 For mobile
help 2022-08-04 19:30:40 There will be more than one f on the screen
help 2022-08-04 19:32:00 Gimmie a sec
help 2022-08-04 19:33:30 Btw how will I make servos roll
help 2022-08-04 19:33:43 Like have roll.control
help 2022-08-04 19:34:45 But then if I press it I won't have yaw or pitch cause it will be roll
help 2022-08-04 19:37:24 Bruh
help 2022-08-04 19:38:24 Or I can just give up on missiles and just makes planes that launch upwards
help 2022-08-04 19:39:15 So give me a sec to make a crappy design
help 2022-08-04 19:40:11 Can u tell me what motor lock is cause I am an idiot
help 2022-08-04 19:40:27 ?
help 2022-08-04 19:40:53 Mk
help 2022-08-04 19:41:00 So gimme a sec
help 2022-08-04 19:52:55 Ok so I made a thing that spins but I did the roll basically I might use hover engine again cause it make it stable but I now can roll I will now need to put like the pitch and yaw kanards
help 2022-08-04 20:03:17 Ok so what I will do is have the design I had for the roll maybe lower the speed more and pitch
help 2022-08-04 20:03:28 It will be about 3-4 wide
help 2022-08-04 20:03:41 For now roll is at 25 angle
help 2022-08-04 20:03:47 Here
help 2022-08-04 20:03:47 
help 2022-08-04 20:03:54 Exactly my settings
help 2022-08-04 20:05:02 I think these good but the rocket motor is killing my stability
help 2022-08-04 20:05:24 So I will go back to hover motor with a half block underneath it
help 2022-08-04 20:09:36 I need to be really fast and it to only need one block of space
help 2022-08-04 20:09:42 So I can't use either
help 2022-08-04 20:45:02 I fucking did it after a lot of tinkering and changing settings it can be better but a made it work
help 2022-08-04 20:45:13 
help 2022-08-04 20:46:28 At least it turns and everything and that's cause I didn't have it at max speed
help 2022-08-04 20:48:27 At max speed it wiggles thought
help 2022-08-04 20:48:40 I might have to find a way to stop that
help 2022-08-04 20:54:23 Oof
help 2022-08-04 20:54:57 <#529858892075761694>?

help 2022-08-04 20:56:51 Nothing we can do
help 2022-08-04 21:29:18 Save whatever you're doing load an other build
help 2022-08-04 21:29:42 And un ragdoll
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:32:08 So  does anyone know how to make this not wiggle I'm trying to make a guided missile but when I get it at max speed it wiggles making it impossible to aim
help 2022-08-04 21:39:01 Ohhh I just got the joke I'm an idiot it's 1am srr
help 2022-08-04 21:39:11 I'm legally blind
help 2022-08-04 21:40:05 Welp I am really stupid
creations-chat 2022-08-04 21:46:21 I have made a guided missile that when I go too fast it starts to wiggle anyone know how to stop it
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:53:20 Well I kinda need it to be able to catch up to other planes and it's gonna go in a boat so I need to reserve space
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:53:56 It's basically a prototype I'm making to go into a boat as a vls type thing
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:54:23 So I know how to launch and steer and basically get all the problems over with before it goes in da boat
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:55:54 
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 21:56:01 Even more unfinished
general 2022-08-04 21:57:25 Morning
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:08:47 So instead of Delta pannels I should use the normal 1x1
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:09:38 Then
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:10:36 All of them are horizontal
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:10:52 I have 4 on the bottom for roll 2 towards the top for pitch
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:11:45 I'm making it smaller
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:12:39 Yep with a tiny landing gear beneath it then a block to attach the thing that holds it down
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:16:39 I was thinking of putting a helium block on the front but then I believe it won't explode on impact
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:18:11 *sad mobile noises*
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:18:34 But tbh I get really good FPS with mobile
creations-chat 2022-08-04 23:17:18 I just saw this floating in the sky idk if it's a rick roll or a virus just floating
creations-chat 2022-08-04 23:19:24 Yeah sounds about right
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 23:22:56 Rip
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 23:27:19 Wait I might have see that build in a server a bit before where u at some point building in a PvP server like 20m ago next to a missile?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 23:27:52 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 23:28:03 But I saw the exact same shape next to me for a bit
creations-chat 2022-08-05 11:24:31 For 2 days I was trying to .make a ship launch vls style missile and I got a kill with it finally even though it wasn't from a ship it works
