general 2020-06-13 08:18:57 please god make it so that you can't shoot through blastlist walls
general 2020-06-13 08:19:03 it's so annoying when people do that
general 2020-06-13 08:20:23 i made a nuclear power plant
general 2020-06-13 08:20:25 
general 2020-06-13 08:20:42 it doesn't look the best but it's a nuclear power plant ***and it explodes***

the-dump 2020-06-13 08:24:35 anyways yes the thing actually blows up
general 2020-06-13 08:25:08 ***why can you shoot through blacklist walls***
general 2020-06-13 08:26:37 bruh you could easily balance not being able to shoot through it by not allowing the player(s) inside to shoot out otherwise
general 2020-06-13 08:27:36 i had wendys like 5 minutes ago
general 2020-06-13 08:28:25 i wish i could be in non pvp mode and still detonate explosives *without damaging other players*
general 2020-06-13 08:28:41 so i don't get obliterated by sweats with bugs
general 2020-06-13 08:29:10 i still want to be able to let other people see my creation and recreate chernoybl
general 2020-06-13 08:29:28 while ever fearing those annoying guns that can ***SHOOT THROUGH BLACKLIST WALLS***

general 2020-06-13 08:48:47 > <@!429119594272129035> then boost the server instead of complaining (litterally not even complaing)
general 2020-06-13 08:50:41 bruh at this point my hyptek facility is gonna go straight to the hall of shame because i didn't work on the exterior
general 2020-06-13 08:51:16 it's gonna go to the triple digits in downvotes

creations-chat 2020-06-13 23:44:27 
creations-chat 2020-06-14 02:42:21 y'know i'm not surprised that the people with very serious usernames and tank-related names were the ones that downvoted the hyptek redux
general 2020-06-14 02:47:12 what if there was a contest for *wack shit*
general 2020-06-14 02:47:26 oh fuck there's a anime pfp war fuck no

plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:04:54 bruh what
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:05:12 when i open the facility doors down there it's just an open area
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:05:37 oh so it's gonna come back around
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:05:39 also i have it
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:05:46 it is really op
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:06:17 does it wack up save files?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:06:37 also why is everybody always in wind tunnel and not hangar/jet stream
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:07:38 i made a nuclear power plant
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:00 the nuclear power plant explosion is so fucking intense
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:12 it can send you 5k studs a sec with 180 grav
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:23 and don't get me started on 0 grav
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:08:43 yea it's kinda small
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:41 there was this one person in vip server 1
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:44 can't remember their name
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:49 but they had a shit pc
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:09:56 because they lagged to HELL when i nuked
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:05 but it was only like 1k moving objects
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:18 my pc can handle that still in the high 50's
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:30 they were litterally screaming in chat
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:38 i have a built in fps counter
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:43 so i don't need to use !fps
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:10:53 although it does add 2 more degrees of accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:17 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:25 sometimes they get so bad i get input lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:11:47 i hold w, the walking animation starts, have to wait a WHOLE SECOND to actually start moving
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:02 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:09 and also general is on FIRE right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:20 because there's a war between anime pfp's and non anime pfp's
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:13:32 tbh i'm on the non anime pfp side
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:41 i would really rather not be in this server
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:48 but i have access to pub vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:52 and that
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:15:59 is the only reason i'm here
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:16:10 because i kinda see this server as fucked up
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:18:37 yea it just corrupts the server even further
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:18:54 currently i'd rate the corruption level at:
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:04 75%
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:10 dangerously high
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:41 i kinda don't wanna go into the hell that is general right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 03:19:45 uhhh

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:29:46 how many conveyer drives should i put on my rocket, 1, 2, 3, or 10
general 2020-06-16 08:29:49 got it
general 2020-06-16 08:29:54 7 it is then
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:32:34 does altering the length/force of a piston in a conveyer drive do anything
general 2020-06-17 07:36:26 ay why the fuck is everyone in the wind tunnel
general 2020-06-17 07:36:42 the voice channel
general 2020-06-17 07:36:56 there's 7 people in there
general 2020-06-17 07:36:59 why exactly
general 2020-06-17 07:37:35 that's a bold statment considering your current state
general 2020-06-17 08:44:40 do i smell
general 2020-06-17 08:44:54 ***qserf***
general 2020-06-19 09:15:08 bruh i would leave this server because of how corrupt everyone is but public vip servers

general 2020-06-19 09:17:57 bruh
general 2020-06-19 09:18:14 ihioewjfwosf
general 2020-06-20 21:57:01 cold coffee is the worse tasting thing in the world
general 2020-06-20 21:57:06 you can't change my mind
general 2020-06-26 10:06:08 if you die with life insurance you get revived but your insurance premiums go way up afterwards
general 2020-06-26 10:06:37 it goes from something like $50 a month but then it can go up to something like $1000 month
general 2020-06-26 10:07:00 and if you die again you're going to want to stop getting insurance and just ***die***
general 2020-06-26 10:07:09 because by that point you're bankrupt
general 2020-06-27 08:17:42 why can you not refill the tank i wish to undo the damage i have done
general 2020-06-27 08:18:07 look
general 2020-06-27 08:18:28 this
general 2020-06-27 08:18:52 nothing happens on orange and when i put it on red it vibes too hard

general 2020-07-07 04:48:33 the other servers i'm in are fucked up
general 2020-07-16 05:29:34 OH FUCK (those are milliseconds not full seconds)
general 2020-07-16 05:31:52 also no that's not my vip server
general 2020-07-16 05:32:02 that's someone else's server
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 05:49:49 add explosive blocks to your plane that detonate at a certain velocity, like 60, so when you crash it's realistic
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 05:50:08 have the bombs arm on key so that you don't detonate randomly in a fight
the-dump 2020-07-16 05:51:03 i posted this in general and i'll post it again
the-dump 2020-07-16 05:51:07 also those are milliseconds
general 2020-07-26 09:08:58 now this is gonna be fun (this took 2 months)

creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:21:20 like uh
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:21:25 a nuclear power plant?
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:21:28 i don't know
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:23:52 i did make a nuclear power plant once
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:24:05 got a 3:1 up/downvote ratio
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:24:57 uhhh yea sure
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:25:02 i think i still have photos
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:25:54 ok so no photos but there's this
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:26:37 you should pause it to take a good look at everything that's there
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:26:53 i can make it overheat [plays siren and smoke comes out of the reactor]
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:27:00 and then i can lock down all the doors
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:27:02 and of course
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:27:04 nuke it
creations-chat 2020-07-26 09:27:21 gtg
general 2020-07-27 05:44:24 how come whenever i send any message nobody takes notice and an argument randomly starts
general 2020-07-27 05:46:11 good point
general 2020-07-27 05:46:20 but they will probably not be noticed anyways
general 2020-07-27 05:46:28 as i have never even breached 650 speed on my own

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:46:23 i want to make a plane but i will have to sacrifice functionality for detail but i need it to work well so i will have to sacrifice detail but i want to make it look good but then it won't have functionality but then if i add functionality there won't be detail and if i add detail there won't be functionality and now i'm stuck in a paradox
