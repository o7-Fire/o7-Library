bug-reports 2019-02-17 16:23:31 My fake VTOL goes 10x more slow and spawning it in lags the game out. My jet has more parts, motors, and engines and it doesn't lag at all.

help 2019-02-18 02:04:14 I need to make a small VTOL but I don't want it to be tall, so is there a way to make the speed of motors go over 50?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 03:26:01 I just want the developers to really quickly just change the max speed of motors up to like, 100 in a silent update.
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 03:26:21 Pretty simple, if they set up a function.

If you go fast enough and far enough away the screen will become fractured and some parts will go black until the game crashes, you die, or somehow stop. If your internet is bad, this glitch will cause your game to crash in Roblox. It will not be removed from any game because that's just how the game renders objects.

general 2019-07-20 16:20:52 <@163143541160148992> I do agree with all of that. I need to see a pic of your Saturn V.
general 2019-07-20 16:23:37 The thing that bothers me the most about peopleâ€™s Saturn V is the SIVC skirt around the engineâ€™s paint.
general 2019-07-20 16:23:48 The pattern is always inaccurate.
general 2019-07-20 16:24:47 And the text on the side of the Saturn is always pretty unreadable. Thatâ€™s why my Rocket will be 1:1 scale.
general 2019-07-20 17:49:23 I really like it.
general 2019-07-20 17:49:48 3rd stage and the Lunar fairing is a bit short.

When I move the motors, the motors connected to the original detach to in front or behind of the creation, similar to how the motor lock function causes the motor to slightly disconnect. An image of the event is shown below along with the developer console.

creations-chat 2020-02-22 02:24:06 **AH/G-24 Banshee**
The AH/G-24 Banshee is a very maneuverable artillery assault fighter built with a slim design allowing it to be more capable in urban environments. It is capable of full VTOL, and can be assisted with two large BB-7 Turbo Jets for an increased in/flight speed. It is mounted with a twin backlash rocket launcher, which deploys miniature high-impact warheads onto the battle field. These deadly armaments, combined with the locations the Banshee deploys in makes it a well-known terror craft.
Statistics:
Two jet engines, ten super rockets (increased flight speed).
Twin VTOL propeller engines, with three motors set to different speeds.
Two firework rockets.
Eight motors to ensure full controllability of both VTOL engines.
Top speed of 480
