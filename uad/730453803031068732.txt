plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:07:51 I build 5+ bomb experiment
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:08:13 Include cluster bomb but *not really*
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:08:54 Hard to imagine when my bombs sometimes hit my back wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:09:35 And it most worst moment when they hit each other when been released
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:10:03 What limit u wanted to pass on?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:10:44 How nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:11:20 This is better than I saw people use propellers as tyre
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:11:25 Wheel
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:12:20 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:12:31 NOICE
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:12:42 I have to make it too
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:14:28 No I have diff
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:14:52 Cuz my car have 0Meters to ground
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:14:59 I have no suspension
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:15:14 :/
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:15:28 ._.
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:16:05 :)
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:16:13 :D
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 15:16:38 >:D
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 12:50:42 Hmmm we need Rocket module 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 12:51:01 Which the rocket follows the laws of gravity
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 12:51:24 Switch basic rocket to missile
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 12:51:58 :/
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 12:52:32 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:04:48 Gunner seats (or a pilot seat update)

Ok, so the basic idea is for pilot seats (not main pilot seats, blue cushioned pilot seats) to actually do something. This would involve having 2 new buttons. Sync with main pilot seat and pilot seat. If you dont place a normal pilot seat these functions will not show up. If a motor and a gun are synced to a pilot seat, you have effectively made a gunner seat. Gunner seats could be highly useful in the pvp meta, especially for bombers (Cough B-17).
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:05:01 The suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:05:35 Weird things how I can control my plane by not using main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:06:00 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:06:01 But
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:06:45 I tried to ask my brother to control butttt,don't work
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:06:56 Even he seat anywhere
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:07:19 Main seat or pilot,both of them can't be controlled by him
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:07:26 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:07:49 That's suggestion I just copy
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:09:22 When been thinked back,you are right .78% will be the percentage or problems
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:09:36 Such as building perms
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:09:57 Like uhhh,making back the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:11:13 22% must be needed,because it's *literal* on *pilot seat*
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:11:32 I will just give 50/50
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:11:40 Wat
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:11:50 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:12:14 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:12:25 Alot people vote for it
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:13:16 Assigning systems?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:13:43 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:14:59 Well
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:15:54 Why we can't just assign it ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:16:26 Assign blocks for choosed controllable things
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:17:12 It's like,I am freaking build new planet with no crew
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:17:41 Hmm ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:18:29 It's broken?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:20:07 well what I can do just give some suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:21:02 Maybe I can figure it out by start learning about technician things
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:21:21 Assignable?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:21:54 I have much shyt bomb experiments on my plane
