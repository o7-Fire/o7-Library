general 2021-03-09 14:49:04 same
creations-chat 2021-03-15 11:36:58 <@456226577798135808> good tip: make the tip of the turret a smoke pipe instead of the black circle emoji
creations-chat 2021-03-19 20:26:17 extra thicc and no custom props, just looks low effort in general just my opinion
creations-chat 2021-03-20 17:28:04 <@715903009300807711> after 57 years, i finally meet you


The ceo of exposed lock
creations-chat 2021-03-21 23:37:22 decent build imo, lets go through my feedback, superstructure is a bit simplistic and the deck loos a bit funny, the colors are well done but the hull looks low effort
creations-chat 2021-03-26 11:56:20 It looks a bit blocky, the hull is decent. Proportions are right but it looks spotty and off to me. overall its a decent build but not worth an upvote.
creations-chat 2021-03-29 17:11:23 <@294980570885390346> nice build, overall the proportions are decent but the spine is completely wrong, the wedge on the real one is much longer, about 1x6.5-7. the vectoring is cool but just work on identicality and also make the canopy a bit longer as it very chonk
creations-chat 2021-03-29 17:22:52 when lazy B]
creations-chat 2021-04-01 16:57:20 The stabilizers are cringe the wings are wrong and that big bump at the back makes me wanna die

general 2021-04-14 00:14:51 Y'a
general 2021-04-14 00:14:54 Thats true
general 2021-04-14 00:14:58 Im Canada man
general 2021-04-14 00:15:03 Can confirm
creations-chat 2021-04-16 09:39:34 Engines are kinda ass, the body looks odd, tbh the only rzn it has upvotes is pro camo and other than that israel :/
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:19:10 <@!324274557965959172> Why downvote everything? oh and why my MiG, can i get feedback at least]
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:37:59 thats a dumb rzn
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:46:11 Looks fine in my opinion, very basic and underdetailed , alot of room to improve the camo as well, also it doesn't look thin and long enough
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:48:15 Side view please and also top of the flanker <@345527706340818944>
creations-chat 2021-05-28 12:51:56 <@456226577798135808> that camo is wayyyy to bright it looks unnatural and ugly, the whole build is out of proportion completely
creations-chat 2021-05-28 17:21:40 <@719168864705052802>  nice plane and all but i absolutely hate it when people build a plane, it doesnt look just right, so they go its only based off of 
._.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:53:12 I think there was too much focus on the camo rather than the build, which is shown by the intakes and general shape. But tbh just get a better camo and smoothen it out and i think you're good to go
creations-chat 2021-05-29 21:11:44 The B-29?
Odd lemme check the real blueprint
I think its fine but lem check
creations-chat 2021-05-29 21:13:57 I couldnt @ my friend who was in them 
btw im looking at the blueprint rn the wings are about 2/3 of the body length. which is about what mine is but maybe my fuse is too thic
creations-chat 2021-05-31 16:13:12 <@678834321431461900>  if you have to specify not a tutorial then you probably to ALOT of tutorials ü§¢ü§¢
creations-chat 2021-06-04 17:51:10 its a bit of a complicated one here, the camo is a on the bright side for me and the armaments arent good looking. The intakes are meh and the nose is bumpy, i still upvoted as well but i rate 6/10
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:09:10 I dont mean to darken it i mean to dull it down, like bring all the color values closer.  The rockets are so bulky and i dislike that whats the problem? The gun is fine, the nose is a no, the intakes have to be 1x2 instead of conveyor wedges
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:13:25 Its a 1x1 delta wing locked my bad but its still supposed to be 1x2 and btw the camos from irl and blueprints dont normally look right in this game
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:15:41 And I would also like to add that the back is wayyy to flat and should be bumpyish because of the engines and also the back of the canopy
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:21:06 engines are too big imo
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:23:10 you really cant take criticism u dodge valid stuff but complain when i mistook wedges for conveyor wedges
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:25:52 use piston lock with some 1x2 half wedge down engines, shouldwork ike a charm
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:28:08 tell me when you arent lazy
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:30:12 Yes pixel is right you are lazy and that 15 is very off ! downvoted! dont take it personally
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:33:53 yes
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:36:18 very pog but the spine is weird
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:38:19 well without it that F-15 is bad
creations-chat 2021-06-07 16:44:31 Nam its a good build but like apologize to smol man thats fucking cruel making fun of his dead mom ._.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 16:50:23 Shit isnt funny -_- the guy was genuinely sad
creations-chat 2021-06-07 16:52:24 Oh and its over scale so it looks a bit funny with your seat plus the exposed lock on the front and lastly shit coloring
creations-chat 2021-06-07 17:22:39 Nam made fun of smol bois mom
general 2021-06-09 15:50:56 Hey box

general 2021-06-09 15:53:04 ?
creations-chat 2021-06-10 22:27:14 The intakes are gay, the camo is ass and it has an afterburner like tf
creations-chat 2021-06-10 22:31:16 no as in there is no hole in the intakes
creations-chat 2021-06-11 13:58:58 Much better but imo use smoke pipes for the intakes
creations-chat 2021-06-12 23:22:20 It looks boxy and messy the text on the rocket pods isnt well done its just not my preferred build style
creations-chat 2021-06-13 15:06:27 Very basic imo but theyre descent 5/10
creations-chat 2021-06-19 21:13:58 Im trying to find out what part looks like an F-86

creations-chat 2021-06-26 19:14:44 Too clunky the nose and canopy look too similar in angles makes the plane look rounded, the coloring is atrocious and it just looks eh

People just say inspired by _____ plane but custom cuz they tried to build it but failed. That plane look exactly like a shitty attempt at a Checkmate. The colors are bad it just looks low effort
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:31:07 Truth hurts
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:36:10 Listen, there is no such thing as a bad build, everything is progress but i call out lack of effort and scummy little tactics like calling it a custom when i see it üòÇ im not against ur build or you for that matter. Keep trying we were all there at some point but try to up the effort a bit, the fuselage doesn't change shape at all and the whole plane looks basic and made in 5 minutes
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:39:20 Bro not a masterpiece just put in effort üòê
creations-chat 2021-08-05 19:16:17 <@!611251614178869269> Can i get some feedback? just curious
