plane-crazy 2023-07-19 03:15:08 do you know how long it takes to make games, I would rather be focusing on working on it then talking to the fanbase.
general 2023-07-19 10:14:24 What’s with people and exposed motorlock, I see nothing wrong with it.

general 2023-07-19 10:16:36 Look for yourself you can find some
general 2023-07-19 10:17:33 I’m not sure if your trying to be an asshole or an idiot?
general 2023-07-19 10:19:09 At your scale
general 2023-07-19 10:19:39 I build aircraft half that size
general 2023-07-19 10:21:57 Now I remember why I don’t chat here…
general 2023-07-19 10:22:10 You what?
general 2023-07-19 10:22:23 Basically anything you do…
general 2023-07-19 10:22:53 Sarcasm in text?
general 2023-07-19 10:23:02 I’m no fucking idiot to believe that shit.
general 2023-07-19 10:24:10 To mature audiences it isn’t.
general 2023-07-19 10:24:26 Anything you say online can be taken seriously no matter how you word it
general 2023-07-19 10:25:06 What’s supposed to be in this server then?
general 2023-07-19 10:25:36 I’m not braindead, I’m just asking…
general 2023-07-19 10:25:50 You’re basically calling yourself an idiot.
general 2023-07-19 10:26:28 Anything online should be taken seriously, period.
general 2023-07-19 10:26:59 Without any tone of voice you can’t tell what their intentions are.
general 2023-07-19 10:27:13 And that’s why we have school shootings.
general 2023-07-19 10:28:15 But that’s an actual person speaking on stage, you can tell what they’re going for by their tone.
general 2023-07-19 10:30:00 In text, unless it’s a book that specifically says it was a joke or sarcasm DIRECTLY after the phrase. It should be taken seriously.

general 2023-07-19 10:32:52 I was framed in some form.

general 2023-07-19 10:36:42 Not his fault all of y’all are impatient and ungrateful
general 2023-07-19 10:37:02 At least y’all have leaks
general 2023-07-19 10:40:11 Do you want a plane crazy to play while you wait for the sequel? Or have no Plane Crazy to play and wait for the sequel?
general 2023-07-19 10:40:31 Games take a long time to make.

general 2023-07-19 10:50:19 I’m going to get flamed for this but I never played them.
general 2023-07-19 10:53:06 That sounds really complex and inefficient.
general 2023-07-19 10:53:53 What’s the cycling for?
