general 2021-10-08 12:31:55 No need to got anomalies involved
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:41:18 Will it eject shells?
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:41:35 also you can spin guns to make them spread out
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:41:40 At least i think
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:41:52 ah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:42:40 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:42:54 Maybe use magnets to propel explosive balls that have that setting that allows you to arm them before detonating
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:43:01 then have detonate on impact
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:43:30 You can probably find a way to keep a shell that hold them in place while they fire
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:43:41 Then have another magnet to eject the shell
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:43:59 like a break action?
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:44:34 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:44:51 Im not sure how you’ll do putting shells in with that but good luck
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:45:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:45:34 the barrel would need to be kinda large to hold shells, too
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 12:46:12 Alright
