general 2021-06-24 21:21:42 i also have an issue with starboard listing <@!435946988559925248>
general 2021-06-25 16:49:00 I need help making my big boat not capsize. I did a test and placed 2 ballast blocks on one side with the already there other ballast blocks. It tipped the other way, so I deleted one, and then they tipped the other way. Can I get help?
general 2021-06-25 16:49:17 i can send pics of it to help if needed
general 2021-06-25 16:49:36 ok nvm.
general 2021-06-25 16:50:41 <a:no:808369109154267189>
general 2021-06-25 16:51:25 o-o
help 2021-06-25 16:52:45 Can someone help me make my ship not capsize? I used ballast blocks and helium and stuff like that, and then did a test. I placed 2 ballast blocks on the opposite side of the capsize, and it capsized the other way. So I deleted one and it capsized the first way it did.
help 2021-06-25 16:52:46 Please help
help 2021-06-25 16:52:57 I've tried cameras, normal blocks, ballast blocks, etc
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:01:41 yo dont disrespect the kidnap van
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:04:24 it also has music and can drop actual ice cream. The popsicle and speaker on top spin and with disconnectors it drops icecream
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:06:28 it has more uses than just a kidnap van. if someone pisses me off they go off the edge
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:08:43 happy customer 👍
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:11:39 I only use it on people who deserve it. The dude who I kidnapped today was being homophobic and part blocking other people's builds so I grabbed him and yoinked him off the map
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:14:47 I'd understand for normal people, and if I did it to them I'd feel bad. But I have no sympathy for homophobes who use big creations to block off other's builds
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:19:09 whatever, but can someone help me make my big ship build not capsize? There's no in between for some reason. If I place 2 parts, it switches the way it capsizes, but if I break 1 of them, it goes the other way
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:22:03 Ik why it's capsizing, I just can't find a working solution
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:24:06 Fun fact, if you looked, you'd see I tried that half an hour ago.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:26:55 if i can ever get my ship floating I promise you I'll make it
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:29:32 I know. I have used all of those it still doesnt stay centered
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:31:45 <a:no:808369109154267189> i am going to be sinking this model. the olympic never sank
creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:35:44 just got the list switched from starboard to port, im close

creations-chat 2021-06-25 17:42:00 Did you know that a group of engineers opened up all the watertight doors and closed them behind them to bring hoses to flooded areas to try and pump water out? (also there's no way to verify that you know this since you can just say yes <a:no:808369109154267189> )

creations-chat 2021-07-26 03:47:14 how do you upload multiple images into one message without editing
creations-chat 2021-07-26 03:52:07 k
creations-chat 2021-07-26 03:54:49 I just tried that and it said image only
creations-chat 2021-07-26 03:58:23 done <@!587047177558163466>
creations-chat 2021-07-26 04:04:24 First of all, it's anchored in the air so it doesnt move around or get hit by some 9 year old with a tutorial fighter yet. second of all, this took me one google search to find. The yellow line is also a distinct way to tell the olympic and titanic apart. Also, even James Cameron's model that was used in the movie had a yellow line.
help 2021-07-26 17:31:06 can some help me float my titanic?
help 2021-07-26 17:31:26 technically it floats but it capsizes

creations-chat 2021-08-05 00:18:15 for my mini titanic build i just posted i used white star buff which was the actual color of the funnels, supposedly very hard to recreate in plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-08-05 00:22:38 sorry for the bad build, just deleted it. i thought the sinking was cool but none the less still a bad build, ill refrain from posting. cya
creations-chat 2021-09-22 00:51:48 The file is too big to post in the creations tab so I'll put it here. I made the spinning hallway from the movie Inception https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fiHqW_lUHY
