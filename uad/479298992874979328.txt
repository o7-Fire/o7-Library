creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:08:24 sorta
creations-chat 2019-02-05 01:35:31 yyyOoosoOosSSsSS
creations-chat 2019-02-05 11:53:13 
creations-chat 2019-02-05 20:59:50 i dont think i can fit the rest of the body, I might as well try though
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:00:28 yah
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:00:55 
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:05 it might be a bit smaller than real scale but I think it's fine
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:40 one issue im getting is just keeping the motors from glitching a ton
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:01:47 right now the wings are anchored so idk
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:04 im just gonna start the hardest part from this point, the tai
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:05 tail*
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:21 only the left wing
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:26 facing the planes direction
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:43 on the second picture, the wing all the way to the righ
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:49 its because there are more motors
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:02:53 because it has to fold more to fit
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:03:18 this is my current situation
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:24 i might just barely have enough space
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:29 i can make the tail fold a lot to fit also
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:37 so
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:37 but thats just more lag
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:05:00 im at 2291 blocks right now, this will be my largest build if the tail is more than 400 blocks
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:08:45 oh god i just realied
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:08:47 realized
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:00 theres no way i can fit the horizontal stabilizer and the rudders
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:10 because it's the weird configuration like a B24
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:09:47 ]
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:17:50 good news; the wings are unanchored and are not glitching like hell
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:28 bad news; theres literally no way i can build the tail long enough
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:51 i have to build something longer than the nose currently is in a tiny space
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:18:56 sooo..

help 2019-02-09 13:53:52 so you have these two bits, they can be any size

help 2019-02-09 13:55:29 you can do this reversed so it fist
help 2019-02-09 13:55:31 fits*
help 2019-02-09 13:55:51 i usually do this with the top of the fuselage three blocks
help 2019-02-09 13:56:00 but to make it looks better you can just add motors to both sides
help 2019-02-09 13:56:05 god i cant type
help 2019-02-09 13:56:26 
help 2019-02-09 13:57:49 you will have to switch the motor keybinds
help 2019-02-09 13:57:57 but when it folds it looks like that
help 2019-02-09 13:58:00 then you just extend the bits
help 2019-02-09 13:58:41 i was actually wrong when i deleted those two blocks
help 2019-02-09 13:58:46 you cna fill them with wedges

bug-reports 2019-02-10 11:41:21 this has been happening for a while, this random blue hitbox from the screwdriver just stays there
Clicking it or any things i could have modified does nothing, spawning and coming back does nothing
only rejoining works which is annoying
creations-chat 2019-02-10 11:59:12 im making a corsair, might add an airfoil at some point to the wings
creations-chat 2019-02-10 11:59:25 and when its painted itll look better

creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:07 well i am not copying if you are trying to say that
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:25 we're probably just building to a similar scale
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:33 and that would make them look similar
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:23:59 im using the pretty typical half blocks and half wedges with a 3x3 space inside
creations-chat 2019-02-10 12:24:07 like for the engine
creations-chat 2019-02-10 16:06:53 this project is nowhere near done but here;
Vought F4U Corsair
Currently it's running at a max of about 350 or maybe a bit more from only the prop. I'm gonna have to add some trim or something to keep it stable, but it flies. Landing gear may be a pain :/
creations-chat 2019-02-10 16:09:35 rip
creations-chat 2019-02-10 19:52:39 i think its done, might refine it a bit more though

bug-reports 2019-02-10 22:35:38 lol
creations-chat 2019-02-11 00:51:24 so basically, i made a new variant of my corsair
So I have the other one saved, propelled only by the front propeller
But this one, oh boy
I call it the Turbo Corsair, mainly because it has about 300 SPS added to it and I use it mainly for PVP now
creations-chat 2019-02-11 00:51:38 
creations-chat 2019-02-11 00:52:23 
creations-chat 2019-02-11 00:54:34 i have been hit

creations-chat 2019-02-12 02:02:15 kinda slow
creations-chat 2019-02-12 02:02:36 torque seems to be an issue though
bug-reports 2019-02-12 11:39:49 My normal landing gear are randomly retracting
bug-reports 2019-02-12 11:39:57 when i try to steer
bug-reports 2019-02-12 11:40:08 it just glitches a ton and retracts
bug-reports 2019-02-12 11:51:11 hold on

Account: Boeing_Aviation (alt)
Parts: 293

Has the fully functioning turret, functioning front-mounted machine gun, and I think it looks really good as my first real tank (besides a T-34 I tried making, not that good)

Doesn't use real tracks because I'm not that advanced yet

Overall my first good tank!

346 blocks
Top speed of around 180SPS
First of my tanks to use wheels and suspension. Real treads will require larger tanks, so don't really expect me to make that any time soon.
Again, fully functioning turret and mounted machine gun. On the upper-end of firepower for the tank's I've made.

help 2020-02-20 21:32:18 https://streamable.com/wlmu1 how can i fix this piston bouncing? if i cant, is there an alternative way to get a rigid half-block extension from something?
help 2020-02-20 21:35:20 it doesnt help that i cant use much space due to suspension
help 2020-02-20 21:35:42 i might try doing a rope+suspension thing
help 2020-02-20 21:35:52 but i am not sure how rigid it will be
help 2020-02-20 21:38:17 nevermind, a single suspension piece set to max stiffness should hopefully do the trick
help 2020-02-20 21:54:46 alrighty
help 2020-02-20 22:14:09 ok this thing is not working at all anymore
help 2020-02-20 22:15:47 i think im gonna have to just compromise how the tank looks to make it actually work
help 2020-02-20 22:17:23 i need to lower the turret down by a half block
help 2020-02-20 22:17:32 to make it flush with the body
help 2020-02-20 22:17:37 thats smart
help 2020-02-20 22:17:40 hm
help 2020-02-20 22:19:47 i tried suspension
help 2020-02-20 22:19:56 the bouncing makes it glitch out uncontrollably
help 2020-02-20 22:20:54 ok
help 2020-02-20 22:20:56 the only issue is
help 2020-02-20 22:21:08 having the locked motor on my tank makes all the pistons on it break
help 2020-02-20 22:21:43 
help 2020-02-20 22:21:57 those were not supposed to be extended without pressing any buttons
help 2020-02-20 22:23:41 hold on im confused
help 2020-02-20 22:23:48 there is no suspension for the turret thing
help 2020-02-20 22:23:51 only for the wheels
help 2020-02-20 22:23:56 and i did not place the pistons wrong
help 2020-02-20 22:24:02 they were working fine earlier
help 2020-02-20 22:24:15 yes
help 2020-02-20 22:24:18 i told you before though
help 2020-02-20 22:24:25 the suspension starts bouncing
help 2020-02-20 22:24:29 and then the turret flies out

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:09 it didnt
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:21 it didnt autosave
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:30 but i had it saved when i was in the previous server
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:37 how can i get the save reverted
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:42 i dont know what happened
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:49 it said that it saved with 4455 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:11:52 and i joined a new server
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:12:45 i dont want to ping rick
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:12:48 what the hell do i do
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:13:41 ok so basically
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:13:43 i was just in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:13:51 building a 4.5k block ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:13:57 but i wanted to join a new server so i wasnt lagging people
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:14:14 so i save the ship and it says that the save works and its at 4455 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:14:25 i leave vip1 and join vip3
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:14:36 and its saved at like 2k blocks lower
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:14:43 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:15:15 loading
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:15:48 nope
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:15:52 still 2k blocks less
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:18:40 well that cant be good
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:22:22 it seems like all of the work that i did today didnt save
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:22:35 because only the stuff i did yesterday saved
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 21:22:44 and i had saved a large amount of times today
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:28:51 i dont want to ping rick but my save is still broken
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:29:23 and i dont know what to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:30:23 that wasnt the issue
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:30:25 what happened was
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:30:43 i was building a 4.5k block ship in vip1 but decided to go to vip3 so i dont lag everyone
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:30:48 so i save
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:31:09 and when i join vip3 my save is reverted to how it was before i started building today
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:31:30 and 2k blocks are just gone
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:31:56 pretty much

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:34:11 i have no clue what to do
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:34:24 and its not like the save reverted to one of today's saves
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:34:30 it reverted to the save that existed before today
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:34:47 its like today saving just didnt work
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:35:11 /nope

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:35:47 ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:36:39 nothing out of the ordinary
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:37:48 mej that happened to me somewhat
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:37:54 everything i saved today didnt end up actually saving
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:38:47 lord
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:38:53 had you saved any of those today?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:39:08 like i said for some reason everything i saved today just didnt save
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:39:53 judging how saving literally didnt work
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:39:59 i dont think my data is coming back
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:40:38 no he doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:40:41 way maybe
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:40:42 wait*
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:40:46 just not the server vips
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:40:50 he doesnt have a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:01 yes i know
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:04 but you dont have a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:10 so you couldnt have been in the server vips
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:18 however
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:23 you could have been in a friend's vip or something
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:41:58 i just want my damn ship back
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:42:25 no truer words have ever been spoken
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:09 i dont want to ping rick
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:31 my 4.5k block ship got reset
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:38 for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:41 to the latest save from yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:46 so i lost all the detailing
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:54 yes i know but it was multiple days of work
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:43:56 and now im irritated
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:44:03 so im probably jsut not going to finish the ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:44:15 of what
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:44:36 ok basically
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:45:03 this is it a bit before the reset i think
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:45:12 not the most flattering picture but
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:46:15 and now the entire rear fold, all of the interior, a lot of the detailing, the lifeboats, a portion of the hull, and much more are just gone
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:46:31 its not like the whole ship is gone
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:46:38 but it took hours jsut to make the interior
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:46:46 and im pissed that m gonna have to redo it if i dont get it reverted
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:46:58 and i dont dare ping rick
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:49:05 i doubt it
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:49:18 now that im irritated about it im probably not gonna bring myself to finish it

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 22:49:52 but then ive come back

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:33 i heard someone isnt liking motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:48 you clearly havent ever used motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:30:51 for anything good
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:01 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:23 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:31:25 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:39 you clearly havent made any builds that are significantly more visually appealing than a tutorial shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:45 so i wouldnt be speaking
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:32:47 about motor lock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:04 motor lock is the single most useful part of this game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:12 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:15 exploiters
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:22 yeah i think this argument is over
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:51 are you serious right now
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:33:52 hahaha
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:00 just because you dont know how to motorlock doesnt mean you should try to get it removed
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:07 it is literally a feature
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:31 motorlock is not malicious
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:32 idiot
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:48 yes and is there an issue with the normalization of a useful building technique
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:53 poob
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:34:55 look in hof
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:09 any build since a year ago will be almost guaranteed to be built with motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:11 even a small amount
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:22 your argument is pointless
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:35 look at cygs engines
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:44 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:35:51 same

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:15 he thinks that utilizing a feature that was previously a bug is exploiting
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:37:27 imbecile
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:03 remove motor lock and builds will start looking sloppy again
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:21 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:30 boby
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:38 most of the playerbase doesnt know about it because they havent tried
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:38:54 search up motor lock plane crazy on youtube and there are plenty of tutorials
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:39:03 its the player's fault for not taking the time to learn a useful trick
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:39:18 <@!577604979909459989>
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:40:12 you can tell hes losing the argument when he starts correcting people's spelling

general 2020-09-26 12:01:24 but it just bugs me in among us related posts
general 2020-09-26 12:01:28 because among us spells it with an o
general 2020-09-26 12:01:37 but i guess it doesnt really matter
general 2020-09-26 12:05:38 ok so *technically* impostor is the only correct spelling
general 2020-09-26 12:05:45 but
general 2020-09-26 12:05:53 imposter is also used
general 2020-09-26 12:06:08 probably because one person misspelled it ages ago and it just blossomed from there

creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:08:06 thats one of the simplest types of engines to make, just directly connecting the crankshaft to camshaft
i designed this weird magnet steam engine kind of thing a while back
creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:10:06 timing belts can slip easily, i would recommend using a motor linkage if you are going to make anything
motor linkages have zero slip and very little friction
any form of slippage would ruin the engines performance

creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:16:33 90% of this is unnecessary
you literally did just saw it in half and add unnecessary shit
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:23:27 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/817060787121160205
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:28:02 so you are suggesting that someone with 100days playtime shouldnt be expected to make half-decent builds
that seems extremely counter-intuitive
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:30:04 if thats what you think 👍

<@!323928094132011008> okay but isnt part of having fun being able to create builds that you are proud of and can show off to others, rather than being contempt with lower-quality builds?
of course i know this is roblox, but the point that im getting at is that its difficult to enjoy a game when your skills dont progress
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:32:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:35:53 the point of the argument was about how people with higher playtimes should be expected to have somewhat higher quality builds
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:35:59 or atleast a better understanding of the game
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:36:28 bro
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:36:38 im not quite sure what your thought process is right now
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:36:48 if someone "learns differently"
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:36:54 first of all
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:37:04 what different way is there to learn other than trial and error

btw 2 block wide wings are roughly 2 meters depending on how you convert
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:15:06 you are expecting me to believe this
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:17:29 i can offer some feedback:
i feel like if you add more delta wings and extend the curve of the wing, the top profile of the wing will look much better
maybe either use motor angled wings or something else
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:21:31 also hes trying to say that he used real measurements given to him by his grandfather who guarded an sr-71 when it was in service <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>

general 2021-10-31 18:17:15 It's been 60+ hours without Roblox and Plane Crazy, my mental state is rapidly deteriorating. Every time I shut my eyes I see motors. I have gained x-ray vision and have discovered that I am entirely made of Motor 2s. Praying to Rickje139 is my only hope and he graces me with the gift of perseverance. I began developing symptoms of PTSD only about 3 hours into Roblox's outage and it is only becoming more severe. Online therapy has done nothing. But, praying to Rickje139 eases the pain. I can't believe I just donated 10,000 Robux to Rick only for this to happen. I have begun eating incomprehensible amounts of food to cope with the loss of my beloved Plane Crazy. I now sleep in a large bathtub filled with warm water to ease the pain of my movement. Just an hour ago, I dislocated all of my fingers while refreshing roblox.com to see if it was revived. However, with each click of my mouse, my soul was only cast farther into the deep chasms of disappointment.

creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:13:43 you can change the rpm vs torque output
larger stroke = more torque less rpm
smaller stroke = more rpm less torque
its like having a 2 speed gearbox
in a real engine being able to change the amount of compression is also useful for fuel economy
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:16:51 changing the timing wont let you increase rpm above a certain point
being able to reduce the piston stroke expands the efficient operating range of the engine
