plane-crazy 2020-08-01 01:06:09 Who else is having the glitch where if you click the "Launch" button or whatever you call it, it just teleports you to the center of your plot and doesnt do anything

bot-central 2021-01-24 15:49:55 ?
bot-central 2021-01-24 15:49:59 ?rhelp
bot-central 2021-01-24 15:50:28 &suggest There should be a 2-wide motor for creations with a 2-wide center
bug-reports 2021-01-24 15:54:39 Disconnectors won't work when they are attached to an anchored block
bug-reports 2021-01-24 16:21:56 One side doesn't have an anchored block
bug-reports 2021-01-24 16:30:52 Yes, Rickje told me about that.
bug-reports 2021-01-24 16:31:29 That fixed it
bot-central 2021-06-29 20:21:14 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-06-29 20:22:51 &suggest I suggest that the color tab when painting blocks should be customisable. E.G. You should be able to create your own color palettes that will be saved for later. Its annoying having to enter the exact RGB value for every color I need.
