help 2022-07-19 13:05:09 do you have a counter rotor??
bot-central 2022-07-19 13:13:07 !rank
help 2022-07-19 13:16:15 i don't think that making a single stable rotor with tilting rotor configuration is possible, because of the torque generated by the rotor would make it unstable
help 2022-07-19 13:16:27 but that's my thought
help 2022-07-19 13:16:30 could be wrong
