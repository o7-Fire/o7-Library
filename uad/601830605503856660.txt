plane-crazy 2022-03-09 16:02:27 New update changed all my cameras to default (1) any way i can change them all at once?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 16:57:44 Same here
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 16:59:43 Is there any way to fix the cameras? Or is it already undergoing repairing? It quite literally makes nearly my whole saved builds unusable :(
