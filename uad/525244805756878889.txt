general 2020-09-15 06:59:12 poggers
general 2020-09-15 09:46:09 about a map change rick should add a racetrack
general 2020-09-15 09:46:48 or more flat terrain like a city or a racetrack
general 2020-09-15 09:47:26 or maybe add stalingrad
general 2020-09-15 09:47:51 and maybe penetration
general 2020-09-15 09:48:24 so a block with angle can ricochet
general 2020-09-15 09:51:49 i just want a ricochet game mechanic so the wedges block have a chance to ricochet gun or maybe add a real tank cannon so the mechanic would work
general 2020-09-15 09:52:06 it would be better
general 2020-09-15 09:52:35 and trash build cannont pen a real designed tank
general 2020-09-15 09:53:55 we need ricochet so trash built is nothing to compare with real tank
general 2020-09-15 09:54:26 https://tenor.com/view/dog-cake-scoop-scared-sliced-gif-12561789
general 2020-09-15 09:55:21 > for now the only reasonable update are tank shells
that should be the next major update
general 2020-09-15 09:56:36 and cutter should be nerfed so just like the ricohet u cannot cut angled wedges

plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:03:34 Making the center propeler able to rotate and locked without twitching is pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:04:24 That somewhat a nice grill
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:41:18 Before and after idk this TD flips easily
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:44:46 The suspension can sometimes spring upward when it hits corner at speed and too sharp
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:47:52 The fact that its a mix of German and Russian tank wich probably why its so unstable
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:51:16 So a t34 chassi a hetzer crew and front armor layout, a su 100 gun a dhsk machine gun, a pumas engine
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:53:59 The adjustable suspension makes the tank br 7.3
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 12:56:21 Tried to make that once its crap
creations-chat 2021-08-12 14:29:50 Hmmm lvkv?
creations-chat 2021-08-12 14:33:36 If there isnt a helicopter that launches torpedo ill just make one from scratch
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:40:46 Wip LS 3 it looks crap since im still figuring out how to make that curve on the hull
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:45:53 That's new
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:46:20 Or not idk probably some easter egg or leak for future updates
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:05 Probably a sponge so you can create under water base that isnt flodding inside?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:32 Its sucks but ik
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:47:42 Just keep it for a possibility
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 14:48:57 Yeah i mean if it can be then its a good thing i guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 15:11:55 Do anyone exept me think that the rail is bit too wide or no?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 15:13:20 Ja
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 15:14:06 Its too wide for me since i mostly make things small or medium not big
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 15:14:29 A 5 wide track is already big 3 wide is enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 15:14:53 Also smaller versions of train wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:42:41 finaly a new easy project has 90% done
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 13:23:19 when you put complicated things on small plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:56:15 It looks like something that straight out of ace combat or something

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:24:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:25:09 all of my bomb is exposed on the underbelly or being towed
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:29:19 i did it again a very thight motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:36:16 that roll rate its faster than any plane i created
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:37:29 all of my plane got good pitch prob because i used all my plane in diving manuever
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 09:37:57 nah i dont like new jet

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:58:36 I can make it but it requires motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:41:57 3 engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:43:16 tried to make this
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:44:05 i think mine need longer intake in and longer front fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:56:55 mhm much better
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 10:41:47 this litelary looked like 3 engined mig with tomcat mixed together
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 10:43:15 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 14:46:41 i think its done still need better painting than this though
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 14:47:36 heck this is a too compact motorlock setup again
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 14:52:59 Im Always better at making engine than the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 14:56:11 Its actually the nar-349 retaliator
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 14:56:32 They almost the same

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:00:43 this shoddy thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:02:18 the cockpit looks silly
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:03:38 i like the fuselage but i think the cockpit should look like a crusader without intake or an invader
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:08:56 do you think i should make that but with crusaders intake
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:09:08 and cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:13:08 ill try later
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 13:57:44 3 intake = more succ
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 13:58:31 and yes im making a f7u cutlass but with f-8 crusader front fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:46:25 i created a new plane out of 3 existing plane mhm
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:53:54 ugly lil crap
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 15:00:09 i could prob change the tail into a f-6 banshee tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 15:00:33 rather than the extended cutlass tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:17:58 i need color for this
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:18:42 a crusader cockpit with a cutlass engine and fuselage with banshee tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:19:28 they have the same color
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:19:39 a blue navy or those ugly grey
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:22:39 3 intake
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:23:02 but only 2 engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:23:30 suply more oxygen
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:24:53 i also have an unfinished mirage
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 09:25:16 its a stress to motorlock everything cus the mirege is so smol

plane-crazy 2022-02-07 12:22:28 Prototype doing its own thing
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 12:23:10 Hof plen lol
creations-chat 2022-02-07 15:11:45 Different but almost the same
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 09:52:24 https://imgur.com/a/woxqQed  this is kinda unstable
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 09:53:26 nah its just a stupidly overengineered walker
creations-chat 2022-02-20 14:33:48 Creations feedback momentan amirite chat
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:49:54 Based
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 09:31:57 hmm it works better than i think
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 09:32:23 Triebflugel
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 09:32:33 well the cockpit dosent look like it
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 09:33:28 mhm diffrent
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 09:34:18 cant do motorlock around the rotor cus it just glitcehd the rotor
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 10:34:39 I did it in 15 minutes afterall
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 10:35:04 I just make it for prove will that Design work or not
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:20:45 I need to make the "closed cockpit" version of this but oh well it works for now
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:24:20 Nop
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:24:29 Mines perfect
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:25:10 Thats weird
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:25:50 Well the only prob with mine is the vertical stability is lacking
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:26:28 I did that once but its the normal rocket engine version
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:26:48 Maybe thats why
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:28:18 Normal rockets are too slow thats why that version can become de sync
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:28:33 While the super rocket dint de sync
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:28:45 Bruv
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:29:03 Motor power makes my whole setup janky
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:30:43 Does what
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:30:50 Janky?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 14:44:05 Uhyh
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 15:13:58 Well what did you built
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 14:21:38 I hate bri'sh design they're so awkward to make
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 14:34:53 I mean yeah and some weird angles too
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:40:45 This looks too plain
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:50:54 I think i should fix the shape of this uhh anything that can help me?
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:51:22 Daimler ferret
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:07 Idk how to make one
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:25 Besides the motor lock on this is a mess
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:32 Its very jumbled
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:53:57 I cant shortned it otherwise it would collide with the axle
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:54:34 Hahhh remake huh i kinda want to try make small things
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:54:55 It always ended up tad weird
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:55:09 Im only good at building helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:55:23 And a 3 wheeler
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:55:45 Hmm mine dosent bounce
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:56:02 Also its still the same for the suspension
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:56:23 If i dont use one uhh it somehow get stuck
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 15:57:02 Well all of my motorlock is in the middle part
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:02:18 Ayo what happened lol
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:02:53 Haha lmao
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:03:44 Oop
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:03:56 The meme is mov crikey
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:05:17 
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:07:51 Well im unironically Australian soo
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:08:03 What
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:08:23 Whats wrong being Australian
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:09:21 Nobody cares
the-dump 2022-03-15 16:09:54 For what  purpose even people care about others
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 07:57:58 wip just need a little bit more
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 08:06:28 yall prob know what it is already
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 08:38:41 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 10:16:45 should i change the cockpit colour or not?
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 10:24:36 ref image for reference
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 10:30:30 what color code
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 10:50:18 bruv how did this reach that speed at horizontal flight
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 11:03:34 is this better?
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 11:04:44 no
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 11:05:18 also at this point it works better as a gyrocopter instead of helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 11:07:15 holy crap i dint noticed it
contest-chat 2022-03-20 00:54:27 What in the world is that straw block
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:04:03 First time making an airliner wip
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:04:43 What
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:04:57 Its the FMA IA Condor
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:05:21 Yeah cus the default is blended too well
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:05:26 Cant defined the shape
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:06:01 Ik
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:06:18 Its bit hard too smoothen it out
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:07:02 Ill try
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:07:13 If its possible
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:11:51 Hmm i see ill keep that in mind
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:12:22 I never do 4 so ill just do 3
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:24:29 Ye
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:26:05 I like the idea of using 5 engine and makes it basically into one
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:03:49 What
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:03:54 Again?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:04:43 Its just you
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:05:05 The front is also like the b29 but bit sharper
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:07:56 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:13:34 Argentina comet
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:14:17 Cus if its not failed to mass production stage, it would be a competitor of the de havilland comet
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:15:04 I know right its 5 engine in a single plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:15:22 Its faster than the comet too
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:17:22 20% faster than the de havilland comet mhmn
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 16:34:09 Bmd4
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 07:40:51 i guess this is better
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 07:41:10 this
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 07:42:12 but im using this as refrence cus the wing placement is better
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 07:44:59 man if only motor 2 has lock settings then i can lock in an angle that i desired without doing more task
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 07:50:49 yeah bomber cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:21:36 is this tail too long or noh
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:37:23 i think this looks good
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:40:54 i can make the nos sharp lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 08:49:31 the FMA IA condor
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 10:04:17 time to paint it
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 10:48:18 
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 10:48:25 easy
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 10:55:48 yep its very simple
creations-chat 2022-03-21 11:26:01 yeah too lazy to make ddouble angled thick wing
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 09:56:23 i just need the horizontal stabilizer and the wing pontoons
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 09:56:28 well and engine also
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 10:24:31 just need the engine now
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 10:24:44 and the horizontal stabilizer again
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 11:37:35 sea master
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 13:31:42 almost done just need some finishing touches
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 13:34:11 yep
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 13:58:22 tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 14:01:14 i did it with my broken eye so the colors might not look good
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 14:05:31 mm?
creations-chat 2022-03-23 14:32:19 Half of my eyes decided to not render color and some shapes correctly
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 06:19:46 i dont think the P6M has an afterburner
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:28:54 I just noticed that My P6M roll rate is faster than my weird passenger plane and it can fly without tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:31:46 Its stable although it has slight positive pitch even with tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:32:13 To make it able to take off from sea
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:32:34 Nop the fuselage is too big to fly without wing
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:33:01 It can fly with half of wing though
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:33:29 If the tail is intact that is
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:34:09 My engine there is just for decoration
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 13:34:39 The real engine is on the fuselage so it can take off from water
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:17:07 when the wooden mockup looked crazy already
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:22:33 hello there
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:27:13 this looks weird tbh\
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:38:36 A helicopter with a cockpit that works as a double barrel 40mm turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:56:03 Why
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:58:24 Dint i tell you its a wooden mockup
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 14:59:03 I always made my build starting the wooden mockup first
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 00:23:23 Hold up is that 1×1 cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 00:24:38 Nah i just wondering why on that angle it looks bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 01:41:37 Damn i kinda want to build this now
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 11:28:23 the tram chassi is done lets gooo
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 14:06:48 you know who this is
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 14:07:09 its toby
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 14:07:25 or GER class G15
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 00:13:57 I forgot that parachute existed
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 23:08:45 You either need to motorlock the fuselage or the tail part
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 23:09:53 Lile this
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 14:51:19 Turboprop b-52-p
plane-crazy 2022-04-07 07:05:25 i need new paintjob
contest-chat 2022-04-09 15:00:55 J20?
contest-chat 2022-04-09 15:00:59 What's that
contest-chat 2022-04-09 15:06:40 It dosent looked like that
contest-chat 2022-04-09 15:12:20 Well just a tiny bit
the-dump 2022-06-06 07:40:56 holup
the-dump 2022-06-06 07:42:24 what in the world im not even a female or a gay
the-dump 2022-07-19 06:59:58 Megamind's eye
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 14:37:45 i think its coming along nicely
creations-chat 2022-07-30 16:00:26 Now i just need to figure out what to put on it
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:07:59 Well i guess its time for a no sleep week
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:49:39 Should I make Chinese heli or Swedish
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:56:07 Chinese
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:56:14 Swedish
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:56:18 Which one
contest-chat 2022-11-07 15:57:50 I shall make two of em if i even have time
contest-chat 2022-11-07 16:01:27 Or i could make this two
contest-chat 2022-11-07 16:03:04 Scout heli
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 11:26:28 i think its a good enough of a proggres for now
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 11:27:56 from the top it certainly looked bit weird
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 11:35:33 a mix of bunch of flying wings that i found
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 11:38:25 the cockpit is ho 229 with yb 49
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 11:38:45 the engggine is just fictional
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 15:00:58 How in the world do i make my wing from thick to thin
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 15:43:27 From 4 block tall to 1 block tall
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 15:44:37 Currently this long
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 15:45:35 I mean its a flying flying wing
general 2022-12-04 15:48:40 Balistic rocket has far more range
general 2022-12-04 15:48:58 And you get a lot of em in a pod
general 2022-12-04 15:49:16 Now put 8 of those pod on the plane
general 2022-12-04 15:51:02 Nah m4a3 105 iis good at it br it can bounce almost any shells by angling a bit and the heat shells are quite good
general 2022-12-04 15:51:21 Yeah
general 2022-12-04 15:52:01 I still use it a 6.0 for lobbing heat purposes
general 2022-12-04 15:52:50 I mean i also still use the bt-42 at 5.3
general 2022-12-04 15:55:03 Swedish tank at higher br is like a mix of Italian and German with all of those autocannon and leopards
general 2022-12-04 15:56:27 True
general 2022-12-04 15:56:51 I like the surbelinde or whatever iit called
general 2022-12-04 15:57:25 Yee
general 2022-12-04 15:58:18 The 20mm is useful when your barrel broke and your Opponent is a light armored armored vehicle
general 2022-12-04 15:58:37 Large and not much depression
general 2022-12-04 15:59:40 The pvkv2 tho although its tall it has a lot of depression aand caan hide almost anywhere hulldown
general 2022-12-04 16:00:45 Halftrack
general 2022-12-04 16:01:19 I think. There is. An spg called zyrnik or something
general 2022-12-04 16:01:48 I saw a glimpses of it in a 5.3 match
general 2022-12-04 16:02:04 No
general 2022-12-04 16:02:10 The zyrnik
general 2022-12-04 16:02:20 Or whatever ittss ccallledd
general 2022-12-04 16:03:48 Ye
general 2022-12-04 16:04:35 Also i rarely see centurion dozer this days
general 2022-12-04 16:06:39 Is there a t30 without autoloader irl?
general 2022-12-04 16:07:03 True
general 2022-12-04 16:07:37 It would be much easier getting kill with enemy that hard to oveerpressuree with the he shell
general 2022-12-04 16:09:06 Thats tall
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 07:48:25 i never seen this
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 07:50:59 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 08:44:18 bruh its so wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 08:57:48 it looks bit janky from the side
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 09:28:01 boy it stands
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 10:34:25 it flies
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 10:40:18 hah it looks like a boomerang
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 11:22:19 but its not
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 13:58:17 when theres more than 1 pilot
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 13:58:55 do what
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:00:16 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:36:07 silly ahh plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:37:09 tbh from the back it looks better
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:37:40 yeah cant hide it cus i made it too compact
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:39:18 that stupid exposed lock keep bothering me
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:43:00 i always makes it too compact so i have  no space left
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:44:05 i knew but i always realized it too late
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:44:40 even though i have a note in my desktop saying that i should not make compact motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:45:13 but i keep forgetting that sometimes i have short term memory loss
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:45:50 dementia is just long term memory loss
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 14:46:00 me im dementia lite
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:06:34 Build a panjandrum
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 12:58:37 hahhh this i hate this
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 13:06:44 i mean i tired to make it small so it can fit into a carrier
