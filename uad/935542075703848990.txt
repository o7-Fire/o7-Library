plane-crazy 2022-11-06 07:49:24 cylinder canopy doesn't align very well
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 07:49:30 try adjusting it with pistons
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 08:23:34 could my friend get help with making his plane?
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 08:23:49 i can't help rn
plane-crazy 2022-11-06 08:38:53 do you guys know engerdeker (i think that's his name)?
bot-central 2022-11-10 01:56:02 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-11-17 11:22:08 randomly spinning in a circle in the air sounds like flying to me
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:35:17 The springs on my friends large build are glitching out too much, do you guys have any suggestion on how to fix it?
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:37:41 i can't use disconnectors either
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:38:04 and explosive blocks won't work on non-pvp
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:39:26 is that an actual answer
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:40:36 the build **requires** angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:41:01 thanks smartass
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:41:23 I almost never play plane crazy and now I should quit?
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:42:01 also chage you're looking for a delta winged plane to build?
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:42:41 could i suggest the rafale or the eurofighter?
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:43:24 you know he's french when his e is accented
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 08:43:55 it should be obvious that he has built a mirage
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 11:27:25 what control method does darknetwhite's eurofighter use?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:18:01 hi how could someone help me make deployable canards on my dassault milan?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:21:50 come on I need some help here
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:25:27 you know what nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:25:36 its gonna be a mirage iii now
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:25:55 my friend still needs a little help making a jet though
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:28:23 could you join him?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:31:42 his user is qazxdreswrfcvtg
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:32:19 you could join him using the gamemode menu
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 11:37:11 are you in?
general 2022-11-27 05:50:00 simpleboats
general 2022-11-27 05:50:30 was he nice to you?
general 2022-11-27 05:50:48 did he mock me in any way?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 09:54:06 what is a cookie logger?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 10:14:44 just viewing the image can do so?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 10:20:16 just viewing the preview on discord would give them my credentials?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 11:19:39 can i see your F-1 without the glass?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:40:55 wdym?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:41:05 missiles are the main weapon in this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:41:36 you mean rockets?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:41:51 custom missile?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:42:20 aren't they the main weapon rn?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:42:27 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:42:31 thats a custom missile
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:42:46 looks unguided?
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:42:52 its a rocket then
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:03:25 man probably doesn't play ksp
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:04:02 still the rapiers could work
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:04:14 if they were on closedd cycle

general 2022-12-17 13:34:51 do you guys like the royal air force?
general 2022-12-17 13:35:06 people mostly just do usaf and russian air force
general 2022-12-17 13:35:07 so lame
general 2022-12-17 13:35:28 you are japanese?
general 2022-12-17 13:35:45 oh ok
general 2022-12-17 13:37:10 i5 generation?
general 2022-12-17 13:38:13 99er I was just making a plane with similar style with the same nose as your plane
general 2022-12-17 13:38:26 before I even saw yours
general 2022-12-17 13:41:22 99er did you try to copy darknetwhite nose from his eurofighter?
general 2022-12-17 13:42:38 really?
general 2022-12-17 13:42:52 what was the first build you remember having it?
general 2022-12-17 13:43:16 its really stupid and large to build
general 2022-12-17 13:44:15 that's still like early plane crazy
general 2022-12-17 13:44:28 it messes it up big time
general 2022-12-17 13:44:44 imagine like 20 delta wings in front of your jet
general 2022-12-17 13:45:12 i have built it before
general 2022-12-17 13:45:18 can't really remember the number
general 2022-12-17 13:45:20 like 40?
general 2022-12-17 13:46:01 that would give you another dimension to rotate
general 2022-12-17 13:47:06 does it take long to build?
general 2022-12-17 13:48:11 could you give me an amount using days with around 2 hours per day?
general 2022-12-17 13:48:54 wouldn't you have some trouble with the trails hitting each other?
general 2022-12-17 13:49:39 I guess you've had your time brainstorming in the shower
general 2022-12-17 13:52:46 you could fit just about anything in a small space with motor lock
general 2022-12-17 13:53:27 I bet that that thing is quite small say 100-200 blocks
general 2022-12-17 13:55:57 what cobra
general 2022-12-17 13:57:19 show
general 2022-12-17 13:59:05 I bet darknetwhite is going to take on that task too
general 2022-12-17 13:59:32 war thunder gaming
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 05:32:14 how do you appeal for an unmute in nam nam's server?
bot-central 2023-02-05 09:25:00 !servers
bot-central 2023-02-05 09:25:04 -servers
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 11:59:22 is the private server that is dm'ed to you shared or is it for yourself?
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 12:12:04 they're the guys the make the game...
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 12:12:24 i think it's possible to have it free
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 12:14:31 but if that's so wouldn't the server be full all the time?
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 12:16:18 and roblox has a 90% tax on private server purchases, the devs only earn like 1 robuck per month from each customer
general 2023-02-14 14:38:13 the controls one, you need some sort of control for your rockets after all
general 2023-02-14 15:28:17 you playing career or science?
general 2023-02-22 05:01:07 lol
general 2023-02-22 05:02:02 apoapsis
general 2023-02-22 05:02:12 you guys like my gravity ring?
general 2023-02-22 05:02:30 you seriously don't know what an apoapsis is?
general 2023-02-22 05:03:08 i meant to make a joke mate
general 2023-02-22 05:03:35 whatever
general 2023-02-22 05:03:45 i've played the asteroid redirect mission in kerbal space program
general 2023-02-22 05:03:52 so if anyone needs help hit me up
general 2023-02-22 05:04:15 what is the asteroid mass?
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:27:00 guys i need help
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:27:10 how many rpm is 1 motor speed
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:27:38 thank you
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:27:56 that was quite a quick answer
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:28:03 but how did you get that?
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:29:07 i've done some of my own testing and equated it to roughly 10 rpm per 1 motor speed
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:31:50 why can't roblox just use the metric system for physics
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:49:40 something feels a bit off with the calculations
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:50:09 1 meter is 3.57 studs
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:50:32 what gravity does plane crazy use?
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:51:27 still pretty short lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:51:34 stumpy
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:51:47 maybe they're just kids
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:51:54 roblox is a kids game after all
bot-central 2023-02-24 02:01:19 -servers
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:12:19 so turns out default roblox gravity is stupidly high compared to earth's
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:12:44 196.2 studs/s^2
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:13:38 which equates to about 54 m/s^2 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:14:22 that means the default roblox gravity is 5.6 times that of earth's
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:15:10 now the default gravity in plane crazy is 180, which i'm going to assume is 180 studs/s^2
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:20:02 isn't it crazy that roblox gravity is over twice that of jupiter's?
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:52:34 <@434843195025653762> thanks for the help! i finally got my gravity ring working
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 02:53:57 i can let you see it in action if you want

general 2023-05-31 13:08:35 it looks great! though I think you should cut down a bit on the sun flare, it might be difficult to read the clock with that.
general 2023-05-31 13:12:04 black people can get sunburns the same way as any other race would
