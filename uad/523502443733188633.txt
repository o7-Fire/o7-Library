general 2022-02-14 02:37:31 wait what happens if you set a conveyor's speed to NaN
general 2022-02-14 02:40:30 lol setting a hover thruster speed to nan makes it trip out
general 2022-02-14 02:43:42 ```lua
if math.sqrt(-1) == math.sqrt(-1) then
       print("math.")
end
```
can you guys guess what happens!!
general 2022-02-14 02:43:55 nope
general 2022-02-14 02:44:12 it doesnt though
general 2022-02-14 02:44:24 for some reason the square root of -1 in lua does not equal itself

general 2023-07-07 07:47:38 when will they help me fix my plotcopy scrip... i literally cannot find the PlayerAircraft folder!!
general 2023-07-07 07:48:02 😭
general 2023-07-07 07:48:28 i dont i jus wrote the script for fun 🤑
general 2023-07-07 07:48:56 plot copying is inherintly unpatchable
general 2023-07-07 07:49:12 in order to see someone's plane you need to know it's exact layout and configuration
general 2023-07-07 07:49:52 plane crazy might as well be a singleplayer game then
general 2023-07-07 07:50:28 EVEN IF NONE of the model ids or names or anything were replicated to non-owners of the plot you could still manually map all the IDs to the models
general 2023-07-07 07:51:02 the ONLY thing that you can fully prevent being copied are the configurations as only the server and the plot owner need to know them
general 2023-07-07 07:51:30 but devs dont know how to practise proper game security so it's fully copiable still!!! 😛
general 2023-07-07 07:51:52 its so funy
general 2023-07-07 07:52:15 why f3x when u can studio
general 2023-07-07 07:52:18 🤑

general 2023-07-07 07:52:57 that's it
