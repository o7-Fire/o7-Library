plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:40:37 Do water jets do anything?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:40:56 It pushes other veichles?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:42:49 Like push your veichle?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:43:36 Btw nice ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:46:14 Do you have gravity slider? If so make it a fly ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:46:34 Flying ship*
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:47:49 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:48:46 Do you think if I upload a shredder bug custom creations how many downvoted do you think it’s going to get?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:49:25 Even if it has a cool edgy flare and doom music?
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:49:36 And it’s not a copy
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:50:19 Yea that’s a fair point
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:50:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:53:55 Which is a cheaper tactic: blacklist shredder vehicles or 10x guns on a ultralight magnet drive  plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:54:52 True
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:56:53 On my shredder vehicle( I use it to get people to stop camping) spinny thingy plus fireworks destroys shredder vehicle easily (tutorial ones)
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:59:26 Someone should make a da Vinci tank except it’s cutters and not cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 05:59:56 A high tech bey blade I now realize
creations-chat 2020-06-25 05:26:53 Question, how do you upload images to the creations channel
creations-chat 2020-06-25 05:27:38 Oh
creations-chat 2020-07-03 19:21:38 Quick question is a pentagram (the five pointed star) against the rules to build? (ping me)
creations-chat 2020-07-03 19:26:21 Oh ok thanks,
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:36:05 anyone else noticing how blacklisting has seemingly stopped working in servers. the wall doesn't keep people out and the anti copy doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:38:13 oof
general 2020-07-30 17:56:27 is using macros to pilot a complicated veichle allowed?
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 01:15:08 Can you get banned for using macros to pilot a veichle (ex spider mech walker)
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 01:17:52 A macro is a programmable computer program that can excute a series of keystrokes
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 01:18:18 Oh ok
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:30:41 Yea
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:30:42 its layered
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:01 Its layered not photoshopped if you want i can show you it before it deploys
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:06 No its a motor that rotates it
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:13 the outerlines are rotated
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:20 One sec
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:31:54 
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:32:06 it just has a really forced perspective
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:32:41 thanks, glad we could clear that up
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:36:07 im taking susgestions what SCP related logo should I do next?
creations-chat 2020-08-12 20:40:03 Hammer down sounds like a fun challenge. Thank you for the susgestion
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:24:55 In terms of the creations channel to upload creations is it against the rules to upload a image that shows how it works (For EX: a box that does multiple things and you wanna show the inside of the box)
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:25:48 Ok.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:32:41 is that not allowed?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:32:46 if so my appologies
creations-chat 2020-08-13 18:33:26 well im not worried about ranks I just like posting stuff here and see how people react to it
general 2020-10-14 22:50:17 For getting a rank, are creations that use the airframe of a tutorial but internals and overall method of locomotion is entirly different? allowed or no?
general 2020-10-15 01:32:15 For VTOL engineer does it still count for horizontal flight if it needs vertical lift engines to fly fowards?

creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:26:45 Anyone know a way to have locked motors rotated when you launch it?(Locked motor gltich)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:30:51 I think it looks good but maybe a bit more detail especially at that scale
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:33:13 Front loader (mostly because i've never heard of that until now)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:36:30 That'll probably look good but I don't build cars in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 17:42:04 Does anyone know a way to have locked motors rotated when you spawn in the creation(Locked motor glitch)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:37:14 <@!407347404858458123> if you used back loading (Ik this against my statment earlier) you could use gravity to have the spheres pour out representing cement
general 2020-10-15 19:12:13 if you change your roblox username is there a way to update your discord nickname to it?

creations-chat 2020-10-17 00:55:03 <@!515975379245203468> any ideas to improve the cockpit or no?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 21:24:39 Plane crazy reports are still unavailbe correct?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 21:24:55 reports for lag machines
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 21:25:16 Dang. oh well
the-dump 2020-11-17 15:57:22 so myths are true about when you press that "shopping tab" of google

the-dump 2020-11-17 15:59:21 oh they will do some minecraft redstone so it arms and detonates when you open the door
creations-chat 2020-11-17 16:59:13 im not a ship builder but I recommend driving it around in PVP mode to find any parts that are unstable (to complicated and laggy) or find parts that could have been better designed by testing against players
creations-chat 2020-11-17 17:07:56 I feel like part of the reason for it getting downvoted  so much may have been the use of "not so complicated techniques" generally in my experience the more complicated the better votes it gets :/ or just how unique the mechnisim are <@!644377285746622494>

creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:10:16 How does this look for the jet turbine thingy on the alicorn sub from ace combat?
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:14:02 other than the exposed motorlocc. i'd recommend trying to shove the tail fins further in because im pretty sure there isn't a gap between the engine and the tail
creations-chat 2021-08-05 18:16:53 there looks like there is a gap between the tail and the engine on where they connect. (the part past the motor towards the front) not the back part of the tail
creations-chat 2021-08-06 03:45:58 This runway is kinda bland and I've never really built a runway before. so any suggestions what to add? (the width is 5 blocks)
creations-chat 2021-08-09 01:40:10 This community does not like exposed motor lock.  However what about those motors that float off to the side for folding ships?

(I'm asking because I am debating weather or not I should rebuild about half of my boat just to fix this problem)
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:54:45 So someone said that they’re some sort of damage multiplayer on cutters against veichles with wing parts.. Is this true?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:55:11 Ok good because I was about to loose it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:57:15 Oh I wanna ask does posting a “shredder bug” type veichle warrant a creation blacklist(I’m not talking about the seizure sword or the copy paste tutorial) I mean something that some thought has been put into the design to make it somewhat unique
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:57:27 If your in pvp explain to them why it’s terrible design
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:58:17 Also one other method
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 04:58:29 Grab and airplane and show them why that copy paste design is terrible

help 2021-08-11 05:41:57 Something looks a bit off on the cockpit I can't tell what
help 2021-08-11 05:46:43 ?
help 2021-08-11 05:46:53 Can you send a reference?
help 2021-08-11 06:00:04 Thanks
help 2021-08-11 17:59:42 1. Try placing the engines vertically instead of horizontally 

2. Sometimes motor 2s freeze up upon spawn so making the front spin will fix this
help 2021-08-11 17:59:54 From what I can tell there are no collision issues
help 2021-08-11 18:00:52 No? The base of the motor isn’t connected to the top
help 2021-08-11 18:03:57 Again you could try placing a motor then and make the thing spin try that ig
help 2021-08-11 18:04:50 No I meant instead of a half block place a motor facing towards the motor 2
help 2021-08-11 18:08:12 hey <@!717078710284714037> imma just join you and show you

creations-chat 2022-01-30 03:19:07 suggestions to make this interesting? as of right now the only remotely interesting thing about this is that it has locked motor with wing panels to make it an actual lifting body other than that its pretty stale.
help 2022-01-30 18:52:10 working on an X-02 the wing needs to be larger obviously but in terms of angles of the wing how is it?
