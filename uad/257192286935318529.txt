plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:17:03 flush means theres no protrusion. that might be whats stopping you. mags dont like to weld when theyre recessed into a surface

creations-chat 2019-08-21 04:41:47 There's no earthly way of knowing
 Which direction we are going. 
 There's no knowing where we're rowing
 Or which way the river's flowing.
 Is it raining?
 Is it snowing?
 Is a hurricane a blowing?

Not a speck of light is showing
 so the danger must be growing.
 Are the fires of hell a glowing?
 Is the grisly reaper mowing?
 Yes! The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing.
 And they're certainly not showing
 any signs that they are slowing!
