bot-central 2023-02-05 19:18:31 !rank
general 2023-02-05 19:21:07 it's equal to everything
general 2023-02-05 19:21:08 because
general 2023-02-05 19:21:10 it's infinite
general 2023-02-05 19:21:46 you can't divide 0 by 0
general 2023-02-05 19:21:53 if you do
general 2023-02-05 19:21:55 it's infinite
general 2023-02-05 19:23:33 Is infinity and 0 same?
In terms of logarithms, the original value 0 corresponds to −∞, while the original infinite value corresponds to +∞. When we treat both possible values −∞ and +∞ as a single infinity, we thus treat the original values 0 and infinity as similar.
general 2023-02-05 19:24:46 math is red
