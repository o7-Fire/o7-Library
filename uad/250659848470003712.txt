plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:23:12 we need more bricks to build with..
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:33:09 they should really increase the height limit....
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:37:09 were servers shut down to apply the new update?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:37:28 and yeah i feel like they broke the game in some way
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:37:38 everything feels weird
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:37:48 or doesn't function anymore as it used to? idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:40:32 we really need blocks that have more weight
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:40:37 that normal for balancing weight
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:40:39 than*
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:40:43 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:40:45 ty
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:41:23 thanks lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:50:39 do ballast blocks only take effect when u test ur plane or do they show the centre of mass change as well?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:53:56 ok ballast blocks aren't helping anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:54:29 i am
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:54:39 they aren't helping my plane be any more balanced
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:37:53 anyone knows a good way to balance a plane, the centre of mass is slightly off the centre of lift
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:38:05 ballast blocks don't really do anything for me even though i've set their density to max
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:39:06 the huge jet engines are just way too heavy to the point where they're not practical in a jet... they really should weigh less
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:39:34 i know but they don't look as nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 23:40:35 sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:27:57 they should make the building plot way bigger
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:22:47 can we get pvp on vip servers... it shouldn't be a big deal to add
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:22:57 really?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:23:05 i click pvp and it's telling me its gonna teleport me
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:23:09 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:23:23 how on earth do you complain about pvp on a *vip* server
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:23:31 like, remove the people that are attacking you
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:23:40 anyways thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:24:40 whitelist would be cool actually
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:24:44 so i can help my friend build some stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:29:00 o ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:29:01 cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:15:38 submarine with a gun
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:16:26 yep
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:16:32 quite thick gun
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:17:02 off topic even though its about the game l o l
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:17:45 oh yeah i thought it was a bug but once my engines started making a really weird sound
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:19:17 LOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:19:17 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 16:27:13 ahhhhh where are my 1x2 corner wedges
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 16:27:32 the precise thing  i need but it was left out of the building menu for some reason?
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 17:02:25 are rockets 1 use now
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:08:35 thats a clever server icon..
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:08:56 ok im so sorry
