general 2021-09-10 13:28:55 Shush, this is a stupid thing to be arguing about
general 2021-09-10 13:29:41 Quit trying to continue it
general 2021-09-10 13:30:18 Not a furry, but ok
general 2021-09-10 13:30:39 No fursona, and my avatar is a demon
general 2021-09-10 13:31:24 You really must not know what a furry is
general 2021-09-10 13:32:18 Thats literally just a definition that doesn't go in enough detail
general 2021-09-10 13:33:10 You probably think furries are people who dress up and act like animals, underline "Act"
general 2021-09-10 13:36:07 All that a furry is, is someone who dresses up like an animal because it makes them feel comfortable with themselves, its a hobby, those who act like animals is actually a syndrome called clinical Lycanthropy, they are also the ones who make people believe they are furries
general 2021-09-10 13:37:10 When in reality, they just want to be an actual animal, a furry doesn't want to be an animal, they just enjoy dressing up as one because as I said, it makes them comfortable with them selves
general 2021-09-10 13:39:04 And for you people who think furries are people who dress up in animal costumes and do the no no, thats someone who likes beastiality, sorry if that was too inappropriate
general 2021-09-10 13:41:18 Point is, those "Furries" you call cringe aren't actually furries, they are cringe, just look for a person who wears a fursona and is chill, thats a real furry
general 2021-09-10 13:41:57 Anyways
general 2021-09-10 13:42:44 Would anyone like to see the P38 I've built from scratch later on? Still working on it but it looks nice rn
general 2021-09-10 13:43:31 What time zone are you in?
general 2021-09-10 13:43:57 Ok, what time is it for you?
general 2021-09-10 13:45:18 Is it 9:44 AM for you?
general 2021-09-10 13:45:58 Wait till 3 PM
general 2021-09-10 13:46:08 Thats when I get out of school
general 2021-09-10 13:46:50 I really get out at 2:15 but i get home around 3
general 2021-09-10 13:49:11 Also i completely modded a plane to the point that it is its own design
general 2021-09-10 13:49:57 P40 Warhawk
general 2021-09-10 13:50:37 People tell me it looks like a hybrid between planes but they always tell me 2 different planes
general 2021-09-10 13:51:09 I'm giving it its own classification
general 2021-09-10 13:51:18 The BD42
general 2021-09-10 13:52:30 Btw It's current top speed is 1,470 Studz per second
general 2021-09-10 13:53:24 Reason why its called BD42 is because its original name I had before that classification
general 2021-09-10 13:53:36 The Blue Demon
general 2021-09-10 13:54:35 Tbh, the BD42 does need a few updates
general 2021-09-10 13:57:14 I'm having trouble with some detailing
general 2021-09-10 13:57:44 Not really, more of the guns on my P38
general 2021-09-10 13:58:43 Trying to make it look realistic, and a P38 has 2 guns on its nose
general 2021-09-10 13:58:57 But the nose is only a block wide
general 2021-09-10 13:59:36 Idk if that'll work
general 2021-09-10 14:00:07 I might end up rebuilding the entire canopy section so I can motorlock it
general 2021-09-10 14:00:22 Plus, I want to make an ejection seat
general 2021-09-10 14:01:17 =T
general 2021-09-10 14:03:32 Its an easy explanation
general 2021-09-10 14:16:59 Hmm
general 2021-09-10 14:17:15 Oh, I can't send images, sucks
the-dump 2021-09-10 14:19:11 Big dic martin cucks all of texas, F you oklahoma, you're next
the-dump 2021-09-10 14:19:44 Oh
the-dump 2021-09-10 14:20:14 =T
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 18:07:59 Why can't I send images?
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 18:12:06 I am not
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 18:59:44 . . .
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 18:59:59 One sec, let me hop on
general 2021-09-10 19:05:17 
general 2021-09-10 19:05:30 tada
general 2021-09-10 19:06:58 nice
general 2021-09-10 19:09:34 
general 2021-09-10 19:09:38 this is a better view
general 2021-09-10 19:10:45 learned this technique a little while back but if you want landing gear on the winds you use half blocks, makes it look nice
general 2021-09-10 19:10:55 the old model was bulky
general 2021-09-10 19:11:28 this was its original design
general 2021-09-10 19:11:53 
general 2021-09-10 19:12:12 that's its original design, I revamped the entire canopy section
general 2021-09-10 19:12:18 looks so much nicer
general 2021-09-10 19:12:53 oh, wanna see the BD42?
general 2021-09-10 19:17:41 
general 2021-09-10 19:18:05 motorlocks really help with the design
general 2021-09-10 19:19:20 no?
general 2021-09-10 19:19:48 that prop style doesn't fit well with the blue demon
general 2021-09-10 19:20:00 P38 maybe
general 2021-09-10 19:20:13 neither of them work
general 2021-09-10 19:20:46 lol
general 2021-09-10 19:21:03 made a stunt plane a little while back
general 2021-09-10 19:21:19 
general 2021-09-10 19:22:27 p38 comes with a couple realistic features, smoking engines, and props that disconnect
general 2021-09-10 19:26:44 ok then
general 2021-09-10 19:54:50 my P38 just tossed me into the lava like it were a trash can
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:25:21 Update on the p38, is now weaponized and decorated a bit more
