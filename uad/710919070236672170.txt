The Tale of future71 (710919070236672170)
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 01:20:32 Hello!
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 01:20:42 I'll make a Voyager recreation
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 01:20:50 Or at least i'll try to do so
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 22:33:50 uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:50:46 i've been working on a underground missile launch system
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:50:53 and i think it works quite well
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:53:26 i would share it here
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:53:41 but i can't yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:54:07 very cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:44:08 imagine if it was a QR to the Never gonna give you up official video
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:44:53 funni
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:45:01 well
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:45:36 what kind of weapons should i add to my battleship/corvette/something
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:45:42 ok, and?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:45:55 good idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:46:03 i do know
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:46:07 well
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:46:22 time to try
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:47:53 yeah it can become annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 03:48:21 a ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:06:24 k
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:06:26 wat
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:06:55 precisely
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:07:28 well gtg to sleep
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:08:22 motorlocking skills used to clip pieces into the ground, and make it appear that it is a round motor?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:08:24 because
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:08:41 i see a bit of white block below the "motor"
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:37:46 you can use small engines to rotate big missiles, you might want to add winglets and stuffllike that for balance, maybe balancing with ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:51:11 smol wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:51:25 just enough to balance the vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:51:31 while being able to rotate it
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:07:24 methods: 1. add moar engines orientated on the side you want to rotate. 2. add a complicated and expensive and vulnerable yet more maneuverable motor system, that you can move with the keys or with the mouse (motor2 bois)
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:07:50 also i just added the CIWS to the vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:16:29 uh
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:16:30 k
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:20:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:20:35 that's a good way
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:20:38 to use tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 00:58:47 i am

plane-crazy 2022-07-29 19:29:33 make your own railroads
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:20:57 PVP nowadays is mostly either shredder infested servers or everyone is still building
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:24:01 haven't seen many of those lately, mostly shredders that spawncamp
creations-chat 2022-07-30 05:39:59 nice
creations-chat 2022-07-30 05:43:06 also thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-07-30 05:55:21 <@523003901075521536> a good part of the hull is underwater i'll post more pics tomorrow
<@401530469952389130>  Indeed, the healy icebreaker
<@682147422218223616>  Sure thing, tomorrow
creations-chat 2022-07-30 13:37:50 <@523003901075521536>  <@682147422218223616> more pictures
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 19:08:36 pretty useful
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 19:09:14 the only bad thing is that you can't really color those sides so you end up with lots of white lines
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 19:18:09 make an icebreaker
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 19:18:51 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 19:20:26 make healy, why not
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 02:12:08 the hull looks kinda nice but the guns are big blocks
creations-chat 2022-08-01 02:13:38 are you trying to get the new most downvoted creation? kinda seems like it
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:09:34 my dude you're the one disliking every new build
creations-chat 2022-08-01 03:14:04 more-BEE-ous

i had to do it
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:41:16 Thoughts so far?
creations-chat 2022-08-01 04:50:04 dw its fine its a land ship
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:35:10 Its basically like saying: Hey here i have things that you could take, address is ______
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:36:36 damn dude, we're telling you already that posting your location is a bad idea
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:38:29 let's say there are two people on this server, you and a very, very bad person that lives sorta near you.

you post your location.

the other person now has somewhere to go and do **whatever**
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:39:07 why risk it in the first place though?
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:39:32 (You'll have to pay for them)
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:41:47 i think there is an unde check command right?
the-dump 2022-08-01 14:43:00 Would you give a robber your adress on the street?
bot-central 2022-08-01 14:46:32 i think it was with - and not !
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 17:19:12 build a floating skyscraper
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 17:55:36 you're one of the people who beleive in chips in vaccines??
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 17:59:20 vaccines were never meant to make you not have a disease, they are made so that your body knows what disease they're fighting and so that you don't suffer from the nasty consequences
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:00:20 ^^
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:01:01 You sound like one so beware
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:02:51 0, if you don' t have vaccines

and the vaccine can even be applied after you get bitten because the virus travels slowly via the nerves up to the brain
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:05:30 do you believe that there are chips on vaccines?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:05:49 alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:06:07 link?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:07:41 "i fell of a chair thus its newton's fault for inventing gravity!"

kinda like that ig the point stands
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:08:43 you don't have autism because of vaccines

you have autism because that's what the genetic reshuffle decided for you
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:08:53 it can
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:09:32 ~~***you know, maybe your mom dropped you when you were little***~~
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:09:38 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:10:02 that's why i said maybe for this example, also lemme get my sources wait here a min
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:11:01 you know, you probably maybe don't want to die
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:16:54 let me explain:

You're on a dark alley and someone might or might not attack you. you don't know them, but they recognise you (all human cells use a similar structure and thus pathogens get adapted to this)

suddenly, you're getting attacked from someone from a random nearby crowd, you don't know by who and you die.

Vaccines would be like a picture of the attacker. they don't prevent you from being attacked, but advise you (your defenses) on who is attacking you, and you know. then, when the dude comes to you you beat him up and live another day
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:18:37 god no US politics no anything but that
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:19:42 the US politics are a cesspit, not saying that others ain't much better but jeez

Washington was right
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:20:23 let's just end this right here, good luck when you get sick and come back to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:20:41 What do politics even have to do with this????
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:21:07 yeah sure don't take the vaccine but why are people making it a political issue?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:21:43 help us
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:24:05 there exist consequences to vaccines, but they are so rare they're pretty much neglectable

its kinda like cars, you could die in a car accident any day but you still use them, why? they're useful, like vaccines
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:25:47 my dude

It says that a lab has proven that this is the novel coronavirus and not other disease
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:26:57 look up 3+ GOOD sources and compare them
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:27:03 that's it
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:28:24 google isn't a source its a search engine 

"""smartass"""
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:29:12 get the damn info on google but make sure the sources you find on google are right
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:29:48 tbh wikipedia is great for finding the primary sources
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 18:30:05 .
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:14:27 more things, now with lights
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:31:57 should i post in <#384025409945337856>  or do some more changes?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:33:16 how could i do some weathering effect? (if that's what it's called)
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:34:21 sorta
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:34:37 that kind of things to give it more texture than just plain metal
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:35:24 i'll try it out, thanks
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:35:45 i'll hide it underwater
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:42:09 now motor is hidden, time to make some sort of rust
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:53:21 slate looks sorta like rust, right?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 20:54:30 don't know what to do with the text though (It's supposed so say US coast guard, but its too small)
general 2022-08-01 20:59:32 L
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 22:02:42 nice

bot-central 2022-08-03 12:09:01 ?help
bot-central 2022-08-03 12:09:08 hmmm
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:40:42 you can place the emoji twice and if the size is enough only one will appear
no problem
general 2022-08-03 20:44:33 maybe not that much but rather a point where if you go up too high you no longer have gravity applied and a png of earth appears "beneath" you, that could work
creations-chat 2022-08-03 22:51:56 probs more

also what does jumbo mean with 8 racks? i'm not american dsavu
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 04:27:39 what can i do with this thing?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 04:28:47 hmmmmm don't know maybe might
bot-central 2022-08-04 04:31:36 -unde <@456226577798135808>
bot-central 2022-08-04 04:31:42 alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 04:33:33 might as well make some actual tracks for the sandcrawler though
bot-central 2022-08-04 04:39:55 ?whois
general 2022-08-04 04:43:11 hmmm yes very photoshopped indeed
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 04:59:42 basically, when you set a motor to lock, what will happen is that the red block will be pulled down by the motor in blue, exactly 0.5 blocks into the green block
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:00:13 
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:00:17 like this
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:01:58 now let's say you want the red block to be at the same height of the green block but you don't have space / you want to clip stuff together
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:02:14 you set up the motors to lock
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:02:35 and boom
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:03:15 that's all i can teach you the rest is very confusing, you're better off watching guides and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:04:13 take this little bit for example
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:04:18 it protrudes out of the build
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:04:31 so i just set up a tiny little motor lock and it lines up
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:05:10 more like bypassing hitboxes to clip things into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:06:15 can't do anything about that

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 05:07:56 👍
general 2022-08-04 05:32:43 speak more then
help 2022-08-04 13:20:57 i'd say you should add more helium to the top and while you're at it add the ballasts along the central block, on the centermost position across the vessel
help 2022-08-04 13:37:59 sure, what do you need?
help 2022-08-04 14:00:57 i see

help 2022-08-11 21:54:54 i don't really know but i think you have to wait two weeks then ask for your blacklist to be removed

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 21:59:54 any idea what to do with this ship bow?
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:02:00 great idea

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:06:35 wonderful idea
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:06:50 don't know, and your pfp gives me pain for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 03:10:24 creations blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 03:12:57 can't argue against that tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 03:13:27 even still

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:35:01 very interesting

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:37:41 i mean we could move to general
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:38:00 ah i see
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:38:32 an expert rank to post images there
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:39:57 i got mine with an icebreaker, you could get one with pretty much anything (and have good luck for it to be upvoted)
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:41:46 20 score isn't really that big of a barrier to expert
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:46:03 i don't know what submarine you're making but i would say make the transition from the rounded hull to the bow smoother
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:48:15 use the half blocks and wedges to make it at least a little bit better

creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:02:02 build looks great regardless of shaders

only case where shredders are <:Downvote:490311668556103700> is when used to masquerade a shit build
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 21:47:20 i don't know it that well but i think what is done here is that he put the trails side to side, then with some text got them attached to motors, then some motorlock thingys and they get lined up like that

the-dump 2022-08-16 23:29:48 yes, jokes are funny i laugh at jokes fellow human

(very funny)
help 2022-08-19 20:53:07 if you mean the bow tips down, then you can use motors pointing upwards and bind them to the drive's
help 2022-08-19 20:56:34 ah i meant rocket engines
help 2022-08-19 20:56:41 use rocket engines pointing upwards
help 2022-08-19 20:58:28 can't right now
help 2022-08-19 21:23:20 how many blocks do you have underwater out of the whole height?
help 2022-08-19 21:35:00 i think it could be that you have too much mass on top, add helium to the upper most parts of the destroyer, and ballast to the bottom most part
help 2022-08-19 21:38:00 1. nice
2. well...
help 2022-08-19 21:38:59 you can add the helium inside the VERY TOP of the hull so long as you add ballast to the VERY BOTTOM block,
help 2022-08-19 21:39:10 it won't be as good as having the helium high up

creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:47:49 According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

creations-chat 2022-08-27 14:06:15 you want another source?

here in south america, nobody uses this term, not irl, not in chats, and latino is already gender neutral, its not referring to a man from latin america, its referring to a person from latin america. Same issue with "Presidente" and "Presidenta", a bunch of people made it a political issue for some reason while in spanish "Presidente" doesn't care about gender, its about "Precede" which is along the lines of governing

plane-crazy 2022-08-30 13:10:52 how many more of that block you can place
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 13:11:37 don't trust it that much it does have a tendency to bug, except for the smaller ones (like the guns for example) which are always precise

help 2022-09-04 17:50:03 you can make mechanical "sensors" with hover engines as they'll lift up or fall down whether you are there or not
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:26:41 that's literally how it works
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:27:23 even though roblox's moderation is pitiful at best they do have a lot of money, and you know, when you don't want to do something yourself you pay someone else to do it
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:29:24 it is, real id's have specific patterns printed all over them and a cheap camera can highlit them all, sometmes the programs used to take the photo themselves enhance these features for legal purposes, same thing as to why many printers print a stamp of "fake money" when you try and duplicate real money
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:31:49 yes, my cheap ass laptop camera can and will show roblox (aka someone else because they can't be bothered to do it themselves) whether the id i'm holding in my hand is real or fake
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:32:33 R: Roblox se ha asociado con Veriff, un proveedor de servicios externo, para verificar la identidad de los propietarios de cuentas que desean acceder a funciones sociales
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:32:56 roblox's Q&A says that they outsorce the work to Veriff
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:33:02 they don't do the verification themselves
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:33:36 it isn't very good for PR if your app randomly starts to inject viruses and things
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:34:17 maybe not bankrupt and maybe not jail, but they would definetly lose many, many, many users
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:36:23 also also

in a few short words, roblox doesn't do the verification they pay someone else to do it
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:36:31 nope
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:36:38 it would be literally just another app
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:37:08 all apps have to say to the CPU: "hey bro i need these resources" and the CPU says: "yeah bro take these resources"
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:37:43 they ain't going to send an FBI squad if you send them a fake id but don't expect much else good to happen
