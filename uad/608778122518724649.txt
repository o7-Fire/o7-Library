general 2022-02-02 12:52:22 I'm concerned for the person who designed this
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:14:35 relax dude
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:14:52 it's just a build dude
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:16:08 Does anyone know where the event plane tutorials are so I can build a base model of the Doof-335?
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:17:54 I don't wanna mess it up too bad I am really bad with assuming a shape or part if I can't see it and it always messes up my google image builds
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:19:09 I'm garbage
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:26:20 The mega A-10 is for useability but the other A-10 is for looks
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:27:37 The real A-10 is literally a tank with wings that was designed around a giant gun
events-chat 2022-02-08 02:28:51 The other A-10 looks kinda <:pogey:651848693842182144> tho

events-chat 2022-02-08 12:36:47 I made the OBC a little more maneuverable and made it a triplane.
events-chat 2022-02-08 12:43:28 can I submit all 3 fighter classes?
events-chat 2022-02-08 13:19:50 Imma make the bomber bc I am bored

events-chat 2022-02-08 14:50:57 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
events-chat 2022-02-08 21:37:45 uhhh
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:28:59 for some reason my BG-165 model is fast
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:29:32 it looks like this:
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:37:54 I did
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:38:24 I colored cylinders that were in front of it
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:09:08 It did have a firework launcher
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:25:23 ?
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:26:53 all I did was add a few cosmetic mods + shortening the wings and it has 4 explosive blocks
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:27:10 ?
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:27:30 it is

events-chat 2022-02-09 00:37:16 For some reason my bomber is fast idk why since I used basically the same design
events-chat 2022-02-09 00:37:57 my internet is dying
events-chat 2022-02-09 01:08:19 it looks like he tried to combine all the classes

events-chat 2022-02-10 02:14:35 can I go 50 blocks over on the bomber if I remove two engines?
events-chat 2022-02-10 02:18:54 wait it's 150
