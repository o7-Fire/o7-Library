creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:45:12 aren't 1-block builds pvp oriented anyways? I'm certain looking not like shit is in lower priority for if
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:47:35 you can do 1-block if you want but imo they're only good for pvp
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:51:10 2 wides are the perfect balance
you can still be decent at pvp while having room for customization
(also you can add bunch of texts <:clueless:942802644043464734>)
help 2023-07-14 12:05:28 hi 
to make the wing a half block lower, I added a motorlock, then I add the red motorlock to fuse it with the fuselage but it broke the motorlock tower
how do I add the red motorlock without breaking the tower?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:09:28 agreed but Twitter isn't the best example for that <:clueless:942802644043464734>
