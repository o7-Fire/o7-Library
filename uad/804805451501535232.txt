The Tale of swanky0123 (804805451501535232)
general 2023-01-04 12:01:43 0 drag and 8 speed is what i use usually
speed just changes acceleration iirc
general 2023-01-04 12:03:38 i should go test with max speed set then see the difference 🗿
general 2023-01-04 12:05:39 No
general 2023-01-04 12:13:12 if you want more or less acceleration raise or lower speed basically
general 2023-01-04 12:16:55 🗿
general 2023-01-04 12:17:10 im pretty new and only have 2 planes using motorlock
general 2023-01-04 12:17:21 and the tallest tower ive done was like 4 layers
general 2023-01-04 12:17:33 one of them was just to make wings be in half blocks 🗿
general 2023-01-04 12:21:53 2 wide plane with a hover drive in it is nice tho
general 2023-01-04 12:42:33 whats the holding one
general 2023-01-04 12:42:41 teacher missing or something 🗿
general 2023-01-04 12:43:21 esch
general 2023-01-04 12:43:32 oh
general 2023-01-04 12:43:59 i do virtual and i just realized that i need to start today 😭

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:23:12 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:23:33 better than me witnessing like 3 shredders and a battleship on land <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:23:46 i got big bomb and the battleship went boom tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:23:59 what those
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:24:59 flares you mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:25:05 and on tanks the laser junk
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 14:25:10 lol
general 2023-01-04 23:20:08 lol my 350 block plane makes my game crash when it explodes
general 2023-01-05 06:09:56 damn i need some of those <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:10:03 i need to know
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:10:19 is there a way to make motor 2 work with mobile joystick
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:10:38 i wanna do custom control surfaces but using buttons on mobile is ew
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:10:56 dang
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:11:05 i know you can make them work with mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:11:19 i would think the joystick would count as the mouse 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:17:05 ok so i can use my finger as mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:17:09 fun
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:20:49 or it wont work
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:34:37 it does
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:34:42 it doesnt work well at all tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:34:51 i tried buttons and those could work once i get used to it
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:35:00 wish i could make them bigger tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:42:26 spirit duh
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:43:12 i have decided im gonna do standard controls for pvp jets but my non pvp stuff im gonna try to do custom controls
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:43:56 would do all planes with custom surfaces but using finger as mouse on mobile sucks and i cant make it use joystick
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 07:49:09 wonder if they could work via xbox controller 💀
general 2023-01-05 08:01:55 hmm
general 2023-01-05 08:02:03 should i make my mom order me a razer kishi off amazon
general 2023-01-05 08:02:10 its 60 bucks instead of 100 atm <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-01-05 08:02:24 would be useful for games i got and bobloc
general 2023-01-05 08:03:17 i would use it 🗿
general 2023-01-05 08:03:25 oof
general 2023-01-05 08:03:35 i could get one of those xbox controller mounts since i have those
general 2023-01-05 08:04:03 i dont got that much money 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 08:09:35 hot pink

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 08:09:57 just bright annoying colors <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 08:10:23 just like the guy in PC earlier who had speakers linked across all the plots being annoying 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 08:10:40 i got to hear raining tacos 20 times over
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 08:19:19 pc2 will exist at some point or no
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 09:48:01 idk since it wont do angles for me on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 09:48:14 to do the basic camera lock tho you build the cameras to where you want the part
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 09:48:17 then build off of it
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 09:48:27 cameras go invis but still act like they are attached to the part
general 2023-01-05 10:18:05 me about to make f101 or try to be like
general 2023-01-05 10:18:11 im a bad builder tho 😎
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:46:24 i slightly modified an f86 tutorial and still got a bit more to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:46:29 to make an FJ-2
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:46:58 thing loves to pitch down but if i try to ballast to balance it the plane tilts onto its ass 😂
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:55:58 i shall try but dunno where to stuff em
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:57:14 i will see if theres room
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:57:44 ooh a mess
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 12:58:47 thats someone elses not mine 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:00:01 on the right of there you can see a bit of my thing 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:00:53 am pro pilot 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:02:53 indeed
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:07:27 do you use the joystick for planes or do you got buttons for custom surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:07:40 or if you somehow have custom control surfaces using the joystick i demand that
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:08:28 do you use finger as mouse control then
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:08:42 i tried that and it is wonky asf
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:11:05 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:14:04 i need to get good
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:14:11 my own stuff is bleh 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:14:30 i have decent lookin stuff but its a modified tut f86 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:18:12 if only i could be smort and learn how make camera lock work on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:31:58 god dammit
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:32:31 i just wanna try making wings that way 😭😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:45:28 nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 13:45:47 is that f105 inspired based off the front of the wings i see?
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:52:51 i must learn how to do proper good angle lock with wings 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:18 i think iirc if i make the motor lock be using tnt then i can angle and the wing parts can be inside the motorlock right?
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:30 like if i build the top of the main body on motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:23:13 lol i shot my gun and tapped a guys car
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:23:26 mans spawns in goofy anti air to kill me because of zero damage 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:24:07 i was using my plane that makes my game crash when it explodes too <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:57:31 just had a fun 3 way dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:57:43 got my first air kill with my current jet i use
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:57:51 until the shredders came..
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:25:15 bro nah shredder tryna kill the solar system
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:25:43 make sure the 0.9 side is the one facing motor ig
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:26:01 nice lookin so far
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:26:11 bro nah shredder army 😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:26:59 im no help i barely know how to properly do standard motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 01:27:09 i need to learn angle lock still 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 02:02:03 i learned that i can use mouse control on mobile but it follows finger
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 02:02:28 i tried it and did all the settings and uh
very uncontrollable
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:26:38 ooh fun
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:26:57 i saw 3 sets of these in one pvp server earlier <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:27:15 they didnt hurt me at all even when trying since goofy 0 braincell people are ones who use em still
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:27:46 i didnt hurt em at all tho since i suck at pvp
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:36:55 hot
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:37:08 i could never do anything that precise atm 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:17:18 i have a plane that does that
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:17:23 its literally a like
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:17:31 3 stack tower of motorlock 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:17:53 and it has the purpose of merging hover drive with some control surfaces and merging wing into side of half blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:32:07 i need to learn how tank steering
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:32:15 i wanna attempt a tank design
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:32:59 finna suck if i tried to do motor 2 turret on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 10:33:06 for aiming via finger
general 2023-01-07 10:52:42 damn
general 2023-01-07 10:52:53 i forgot what email i used for original btd battles 😭
general 2023-01-07 10:53:02 i wanna play on my old account since i got like everything
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:14:59 i made fat chonk plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:15:19 it has 2 separare bomb bays with 75 balls each so 150 total <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:25:32 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:25:38 without them it pitches down a lot
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:25:46 with them its pretty alright
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 09:26:17 i have no screenshots of my smaller 48 ball bomber that is actually viable to use 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:05:03 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:05:11 all the shredders i have to face are like
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:05:25 noobs who dont know how to control the basic one that started it all <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:05:45 im also too dumb to be able to hit with rockets since close tracking is big oof
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:06:21 i made a big bomber and i am unsure how make it float
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:06:24 iirc i do not have pontoons
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 09:30:28 i know but i meant float higher up 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:31:52 i dont have pontoon sadly 😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:41:01 i shall try
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:41:09 finna need like 20 or 30 helium lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:57:44 its about 950 blocks iirc
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:57:53 over 1k if i put floats on the wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 10:58:01 i tried with 10 helium and it went up like 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:20:59 im on mobile and dont wanna deal with like 30 buttons
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:21:00 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:21:20 i tried make big plaen but it invert my controls 😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:21:30 left is right and right is left
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:39:07 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 13:39:26 i wanted to make a giant plane that had folding in it so i could start to learn how to fold for planes
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 10:24:16 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 13:41:04 the copy homework of the butter plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:27:02 idk how to do anything more than basic gear
and i am bad explainer
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:27:52 just use a 1x1 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:43:55 damn a mans blocked me for sarcasm 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:44:06 well anyways ima go try to learn suspension
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:46:33 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 14:46:51 if you are able to space it out 2 blocks from eachother then maybe a MiG 29
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:22:28 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:22:53 i need to get bobuc i want to get jetpack for my goofy experiments of large builds 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 16:18:08 its a bug but a useful bug discovered 4 years ago now 🗿🗿🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 17:34:37 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 17:34:52 face your stuff backwards idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 17:34:55 or like
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 17:35:17 just set everything up reverse maybe idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 17:35:20 im dumb
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 21:03:42 cant even drive in ohio
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 21:40:43 i learned basic suspension but it do the bounce when i accelerate from a stop lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 21:54:51 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 21:55:11 my friend did a namnam copy jet <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:18:17 my suspension works ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:18:37 should i make any rope changes like thickness or anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:19:01 i could make it 4 blocks narrower if i wanted lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:19:18 1 rope in middle of 2 suspensions then motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:19:33 theres 2 motors on the wheels since one is for high speed one is for low
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:19:36 very usefuk
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:19:38 useful
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:20:08 i would add a body to it but it causes issues with turning and such
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:20:24 maybe if i do narrower one but just as wide it would work better lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:49:42 narrower done
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:49:47 works good
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:50:10 only sucky bit is that its a solid axle instead of having the 2 springs work independently
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:50:18 but it still works well
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 00:51:14 if i tuck motors under the suspension then it would taller but only 5 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 01:15:01 !f3x <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 04:11:05 i need ideas for what to put on my crawler chassis
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 04:11:39 the issue is how stuff on outside causes the turning and stuff to no work
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 06:37:56 i need to do somethin like that lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 06:38:02 i wanna try intakes and angled stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 08:28:14 i need learn how do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 08:28:35 tho on mobile i would have to use button control for custom surfaces and those suck for pvp 😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 08:28:43 non pvp like airliners they work tho
general 2023-01-11 08:32:48 wat
general 2023-01-11 08:33:02 imagine being able to send images in general <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2023-01-11 08:34:44 wait is that genshin 🗿

general 2023-01-11 08:37:07 /j
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 08:42:17 also the largest size that works is 7 thrusters iirc but more may work idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 10:45:32 i would recommend hiding a few hover drives inside of the plane as well
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 10:45:42 if you want normal engines for looks add em also
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 11:02:36 can we see it in build mode so we can determine if anything is off
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 11:02:48 might need more wing and/or control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 11:03:00 and going up seems to indicate it is tail heavy
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 08:35:07 i watched mans building this
he building it like a tut so im curious if anyone recognizes it from anywhere
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 08:35:15 i asked if it was then he said hes making a tut on it 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 08:36:04 he seems to be basically following one of vulpens and doing mods to it
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 08:36:11 “heavily modified” <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 08:38:56 it looks similar in ways to vulpen he111
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 09:57:58 i did a test drone
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 09:58:09 how i fix it pitching up when i use engine for forward tho..
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 09:58:22 if i do ballast it will nose down when no throttle
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:22:26 i made a door but i wanna have it one further back
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:22:32 so opening is 2x3
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:22:46 i could just make door 3x3 with 3x3 opening <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:46:58 people do since lot of planes with all surface tail (atleast modern ones) are like that irl
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 13:47:27 hot
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 14:22:41 better than my first
by a lot
better than some of my new stuff even 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 16:59:05 i have a goofy wip airliner
dont ask about the tail its temporary for testing
it loves pitching down
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 16:59:18 finna give it my standard wing design and see if work
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 18:54:44 modern problems require ~~modern~~ soviet solutions

plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:50:03 front of intakes
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:50:15 the black on the front of it vs rest as gray

plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:51:22 its normal block but each side can be painted different right
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:51:41 if so it could be useful for my bomber converted to airliner <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:54:52 lol nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:55:06 ima go do something with a plane and make it have intake <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:55:29 also is that gonna be a custom design or is it a recreation of something
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 12:55:33 it looks nice so dar

plane-crazy 2023-01-13 13:10:54 imagine doing replica planes <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 13:10:59 i should try one lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 13:11:11 kinda wanna do an f101 or f106
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 14:09:16 i wanna do an f101 but am bad builder
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 14:09:25 i can do custom stuff but not replica stuff <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 17:26:40 are the COM and COL aligned
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 17:26:55 iirc it flips up due to the COM being way behind the COL
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 17:27:38 yellow and blue things in build mode should be aligned or blue slight behind yellow
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 17:27:49 wven tho i have a plane doing stupid pitch down like mad when they aligned
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:13:16 what type of plane do i do
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:13:27 or do i fix the wings on my airliner thing <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:13:44 since atm the wings are on the windows since original was high wing

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:48:20 pov im making an airliner
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:48:35 first folding plane ever time <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:48:55 ive done a folding ship a couple times before tho so i know how to do basic fold
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:51:45 fuselage is gonna be 9x9 so i can get 3 by 3 seating
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:52:00 i think that is a good enough stowage area underneath
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:52:07 next segment is gonna have a door <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:32:40 me when i literally just stumbled upon cheese on YT
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:32:48 then hes active 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:33:23 i think this baggage door is as flush as i can get it
prolly gonna make it like 4 blocks instead of 7 tho 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:33:29 this airliner project is gonna take me ages
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:33:37 gonna have to have folding tail and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:33:40 and wings
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:35:02 i know about motorlock 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:35:22 i dont wanna make an overcomplicated motorlock mess tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:35:34 just to have a part over the motor as a cover 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:35:54 it works and its pretty much flush so im fine with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:36:09 if i do use motorlock for wings i may use cameras to put part there tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:36:53 airliner project thats a ground up one is gonna take some major time
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:38:30 this is the fuselage size of the airline i forgot if i already sent it 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:38:36 gonna have tail fold down at back
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:38:45 cockpit i may have to fold but hope not
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:38:56 gonna be 9x9
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:39:03 for the fuselage size
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:39:21 fits 3 by 3 seating
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:39:49 i have this i converted from a bomber to airliner
its 7 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:39:59 im bad at noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:40:33 it was supposed to be a float aircraft but im bad at making it float to be able to operate in water 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:42:05 someones b52
i think it might be a tut tho 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 17:42:21 it looks alright but if its a tut then its not really their thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:56:55 looks alright lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:57:00 fun speeds ive never hit that it has
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 21:02:30 vulpen B57 i think that is right

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 21:18:36 oh hoy
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 21:18:37 hot
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:09:29 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:09:34 i mean in theory
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:09:51 you can do cylinder plane but you gotta do motorlock and junk for it to be good
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:10:07 for circular intakes you could do motorlock if you build wings on a central blocky part 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:10:16 well motorlock cylinders on
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:54:40 then you cant do anything <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:55:05 i have a goofy airliner that has a 2x2 sized door using motor 2 so
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:55:13 you can do one that size
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:57:24 i was finna sleep but
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:57:47 around each side needs a 0.9 block so theres a gap
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:57:53 just trial and error it
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:58:53 uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 02:59:00 you can try but i am unsure
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 13:48:38 imagine angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:29:03 edit the text to be blank 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:29:18 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:35:19 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:35:31 would 1 block equal 1 foot irl scale?
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:36:24 so 2.3 feet
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:36:25 or so
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:36:45 so 13 blocks equals 30 feet
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:40:11 teach
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:44:35 i need learn angle lock 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:49:57 ik but im dumb <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:50:37 i wanna try to make my pvp plane use angle locked rear but already got motorlock tower that would be annoying to work with 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:11:21 higher dampening makes bumps affect the vehicle less iirc
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:57:33 i think they might mean like how rockets close track
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:57:42 but like work how missiles irl work more
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:57:45 idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:58:02 or well how heat seeking or radar missiles work 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:49:40 use different cam for both and have uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:49:48 block you want to be equal on each side
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:49:50 or a central block
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:34:03 is there a way to make 1x1 cylinder work on a motor or
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:34:10 like where motor isnt causing issues
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:34:20 like using motor to power a 1x1 cylinder wheel
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:34:29 i might just use tiny gear since steering on em idk

plane-crazy 2023-03-06 14:44:40 they skim on the water nicely tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 14:48:19 i think maybe with magnets and such
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 14:48:30 i know you dont mean folding since thats perma attached

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 11:53:15 i must learn how to do the whole like
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 11:53:31 cannon that can make a round glitch into something using parachutes and all
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 11:53:54 also i may have created a massive thing
but it only can hold like a dozen cutters max so it doesnt do much
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 11:54:06 the speed tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 00:57:47 ima go try to learn how to make stuff glitch into other stuff
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:01:53 i wanna make a thing for tank killing
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:02:04 that makes the round bury tnt into the tank
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:02:22 maybe a magnet cannon and the round has cutter idk if that would work tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:33:29 pink brown and yellow

plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:45:57 no
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:46:23 its a round that uses parachutes or something to glitch into tanks with explosive
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:46:38 like it will penetrate through and explode inside
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 01:46:53 text maybe idk

plane-crazy 2023-03-27 04:44:27 2.8ft makes some sense
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 04:44:47 round up to 3ft and that would make character equal around 6ft
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 04:44:52 so that makes some sense
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 03:53:17 from what i remember rickje has been posting wip stuff hes doing for pc2 on the roblox dev forums
