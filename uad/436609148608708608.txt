creations-chat 2019-11-22 07:57:52 My first VTOL that actually uses tilting engines and not floating down on wings
creations-chat 2019-11-23 12:22:39 Passanger drone
creations-chat 2019-11-23 12:23:56 Thx
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 16:55:37 How do you do wing dihedral
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 10:45:19 How do you do wing dihedral?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 10:46:44 How do you actualy do wing dihedral though
general 2019-11-29 20:51:00 How do you get ranks?
general 2019-11-29 20:52:05 Should of seen that lol. Thanks
creations-chat 2019-11-29 21:26:32 My drone helicopter thingy (its named big drone in my save slot). It uses the lower propellers pushing down to pitch and the upper propellers pushing down to roll it. The super rocket engines are for yaw btw (W,S for pitch/A,D for yaw/Q,E for roll)
creations-chat 2019-11-29 21:26:42 And heres the block count
creations-chat 2019-11-30 07:34:53 For a creation to get upvoted on <#384025409945337856> it needs to be big and is detailed. Also has to work and has to look good with a good paint job and... making a thing thatâ€™s actually an IRL thing is a lot more likely to get likes than your own creation I think
creations-chat 2019-11-30 07:36:00 exactly like that lol
creations-chat 2019-11-30 08:12:18 <@490544126606049311> read what i said above the helicopter
creations-chat 2019-11-30 08:32:38 Nose of a Cessna
creations-chat 2019-11-30 08:49:04 Yeah I'm thinking about changing that block out for a wedge or something
creations-chat 2019-11-30 08:51:09 Yeah I've changed it now and it looks better, thanks
creations-chat 2019-11-30 09:46:10 Motor 2 I think
creations-chat 2019-11-30 09:46:21 You just have to set it up right
creations-chat 2019-11-30 12:01:53 The Cessna has developed wings, a fuselage update and a 1 block longer prop!
general 2019-11-30 12:43:04 sigh...
help 2019-11-30 16:20:13 I need a conveyor or magnet engine for this and idk how to make one
help 2019-11-30 16:21:17 (Ideal one would be small enough to fit in where the engine would be in an actual Cessna lol)
help 2019-11-30 16:30:27 Ok wow the conveyor drive works...
help 2019-11-30 16:34:24 And I need trim because it's so fast lol
general 2019-11-30 16:37:17 wait.. whaa
general 2019-11-30 16:37:37 Lol
general 2019-11-30 16:37:42 Again though
general 2019-11-30 16:38:21 It happened more than once like, surely you would secure it after it fell off the first time
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 16:48:54 This has taken me quite a long time for what it is and it hasn't even got landing gear yet... well at least it flies!
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 16:49:07 Thx

creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:23:15 literally my first motor locked thing
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:27:18 Ik, Its reasonable why people have downvoted it cause its not really the best build on creations and there's a lot to improve but its my first plane using motor locked kinda stuff so idm that much
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:33:18 i didnt really focus on the interior that much, hence why it looks like this:
creations-chat 2022-08-12 17:54:06 shhh they dont need to know the truth
creations-chat 2022-08-12 20:23:24 its my first motor locked nose
creations-chat 2022-08-12 20:27:06 ye the plane wasnt designed to be a motor locked plane in the first place so the nose is very downwards and pointy compared to the other angles on the nose
