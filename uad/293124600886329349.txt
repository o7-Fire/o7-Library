creations-chat 2018-11-19 19:08:47 so i made a vtol

creations-chat 2019-01-06 16:52:22 https://gyazo.com/ddec8a554d01f94c2ef3cfc6e301f81e I made a police boat with bubblegum lights
creations-chat 2019-01-06 16:54:28 and here is a better gif: https://gyazo.com/3fd6f45b7610614683f998c65df15df0
creations-chat 2021-01-03 17:51:32 does my jet not meet this requirement because of the thrust vectoring?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 01:58:33 ballast blocks are automatically less dense than normal blocks right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 02:01:10 okay thanks
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 02:59:45 why do motor twos seem to randomly change direction when used in folding
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 18:27:30 which material has the most friction
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 19:08:31 why does this motor moving make my entire vehicle bend
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 19:11:18 it doesnt do that if i remove the unpowered motors that allow the trailer to bend
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 19:17:55 but if i do this itll work
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 19:17:58 strange but ill go with it
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 20:41:03 wtf does damping do
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 17:23:12 will locking pistons stop them from being pushed back
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:35:45 does anyone have solutions to plane wobbling
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:36:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:37:41 would adding a ballast to the back also work if its a lift-balance issue?
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:38:37 ah
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:38:50 i havent figured out how to motorlock that well yet
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:43:30 and what that would do is add more lift to the front without changing anything looks wise?
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:45:07 yeah that might be why
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:45:11 i cant
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:45:11 i would post a picture but
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 02:45:24 i dont have image perms in this channel
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:05:11 i can also use motor locking to add more engines without making a bigger plane right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:05:32 what are hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:30 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:32 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:22 2000???
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:23 damn
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:11:15 damn
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:27:29 so it turns out adding five hover drives was a terrible idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:28:50 yeah uh
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:29:01 my plane can fly but the tail end just
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:29:02 loses it
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:30:32 definitely not a good idea to add that many
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:31:38 however if i completely remove the vertical stabilizer the side to side shaking ends
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:32:03 will moving the drives closer to the center of gravity reduce shaking or is that solely wing panels?
bot-central 2021-02-02 04:03:57 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 04:48:06 what
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 04:48:22 what is this
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 04:48:36 he's painting it green???
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 04:53:30 dude i dont even know anymore
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:24:49 if i enable the "arm on key" for explosive blocks will the keybind for it be set to whatever is the "explode" keybind
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:26:02 and so for it to explode it would have to be pressed twice
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:26:10 once to arm and once to actually explode
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:27:10 and using the option will prevent the bombs from exploding upon takeoff if "on impact" is also enabled
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:28:42 cool beans
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:51:34 is there anything i could improve here?
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:53:55 i wish
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:56:34 just a custom plane of my own design, aside from motorlocking ofc
creations-chat 2021-02-04 22:59:03 the fuselage is kinda wonky to fit in the ejection system and as for the paint, im really just not good at coloring stuff
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:10:00 yeah definitely not a viper
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:08:26 what else can i improve about my c-ram?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:12:23 what is even going on?? i just want tips on how to improve my c-ram man
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:15:12 this cooldown is killing me

<@!287454032250011649> the barrel is thick so i can conceal the 10 pvp guns lined up back to back
<@!449956273127948290> ill probably build a version of this with no rockets
<@!569298230983131137> sure give me a sec
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:18:12 wouldnt it look worse to have exposed guns? i could try motorlocking all of the guns into one space and having the locked motors act as the rest of the vulcan barrel maybe?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:26:14 oh i get what youre saying now
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 21:32:31 why do my explosive blocks not do any damage sometimes even when set to explode on impact
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 21:33:47 like im having my friend help test out a SAM system on a private server, both of us have PVP on, and its really a hit-or-miss whether or not the explosives actually do damage
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 21:39:22 what does adding suspension behind the explosive do? i've seen it on a couple of builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 21:57:18 yeah this is really strange
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 21:57:24 sometimes it does damage and sometimes it doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 20:49:41 uh..
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:49:54 is there any way to build mouse controlled ailerons without using the default control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 17:55:30 does anyone have a way to stop tank suspension from locking up like this
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 17:57:38 i tried adding stoppers but it still ended up going through somehow
