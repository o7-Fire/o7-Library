general 2019-11-03 01:21:45 so... is the if the solar panel is 100% efficient... why does it heat up again?
general 2019-11-03 01:23:50 exactly
general 2019-11-03 01:26:29 2) You cant get energy from nothing, so you physically can not have double the initial input as an output (energy is not created nor destroyed). So the best you could do is have a 1 to 1 input:output ratio (assuming it really is 100% efficient)
general 2019-11-03 01:29:41 so based off of what you have to say... no
general 2019-11-03 01:30:23 we are no where near the technological level required to even get close to that (ignoring the double output thing).

bug-reports 2019-12-12 01:23:48 Wheels came flying off of the small landing gear (more than a one time occurrence).
The landing gears are attached to a rope and suspension (both horizontal) and in mid air sometimes glitch out causing the aircraft to do some really weir things. The wheels themselves kind of just fly nearby, if they aren't flung into oblivion. Hard to capture these moments so just made a gif of when they had already flung off. https://gyazo.com/6c3e6dcc83a18a25af38b57ff21d3cab

the-dump 2020-06-07 16:13:54 SCP-5801 (The Rising bean)

SCP-5801 is a can of refried beans. Upon heating, the content will begin to rise out of the can in a singular, uniform mass. what the mass consists of is currently unknown. Further heating only causes it to further come out. Currently, ||[Redacted]|| has been observed to exit the can.

Taking SCP-5801 of of the heat source will cause the mass to no longer rise, but it will not return to its previous state of being within SCP-5801. Tests on the mass, herby known as SCP-5801-2, have yet to be conducted.

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:30:32 Tahts... what a wing panel does
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:30:46 they are designed to generate lift
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:32:05 *angled*

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:07 <@!679843010757787650> While they are not tilted they still produce lift, just not enough to actually make stuff happen on their own
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:31 From what i was able to find, the lift calculations in teh game take into account angle of attack
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:44 i wil repeat again
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:35:50 they dont produce *enough*
creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:37:15 Ah, that's the thing, the point of a wing panle is to produce enough lift so that stuff doesnt come crashing down liek bricks

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:41:15 anyway, the end goal of making a heli in PC is to make it hover in one place by only using propeller blades/wing panels.. That's not easy to do with the default propeller blades

creations-chat 2020-08-13 02:50:34 <@456226577798135808> TO make a one rotor heli you need a coutner force, typically in the form of a rear end rotor that is constantly turning which helps prevent torque for the main blades turning

the-dump 2020-11-25 03:18:43 quick reminder
the-dump 2020-11-25 03:18:50 USA has an electoral gollege
the-dump 2020-11-25 03:18:59 and tehy havent said anything about who teh winner is
the-dump 2020-11-25 16:40:44 nom
the-dump 2020-11-25 17:49:40 yes
the-dump 2020-11-25 17:49:44 android phones have it
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:43:06 teh suffering of otehrs is pretty much always funny
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:43:31 it's teh core philosophy of dark humor
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:06 Though, i nthis case, its the actuall skill of teh driver tahts impressive and meme worthy
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:44 ah, but in that case it is unlikely that the wheels themsleves are to buckle
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:55 it would be teh front drive shaft
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:57 and at most
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:44:59 it would bend
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:07 even in taht case
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:13 loss of control is unlikely
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:40 he wont
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:45:57 tehre are those with a sence of dark humor
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:00 and those without it
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:09 i belive he falls into teh latter catagory
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:12 a wholesome human
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:13 yes
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:17 but at times
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:46:24 somethign of a mood killer
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:47:14 as i said befor, the actual memes in this case is derived from teh skill of teh driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:47:19 ratehr than teh passngers
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:19 mobile or slow typer
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:23 or
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:24 hmm
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:50:56 Darmagan, go ham with your anger
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:05 just no swearing
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:26 ***think of the children***
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:39 ...
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:51:41 *sure*
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:20 Every situation has some degree of risk, where at times it is elevated to a palpable degree. However. Comparing it to being held at gunpoint is a bit extrem.
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:25 I never said it was ok
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:53:49 ^true
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:33 ah, but in one case surviavl is a real possiblity
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:36 but in the otehr
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:37 death
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:54:41 is invitable
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:55:18 hmmm
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:55:50 Certainly, but as i said
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:55:58 tehre is still a chance of surviavl
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:06 tehy are in a forext
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:07 note
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:08 also
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:56:13 tehre in a bus

the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:03 > 2 flips of a coin could decide if you live or die
dare i say, this is entirly different
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:57:34 Id take taht over having a gun pointed at my head
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:58:05 thast hard core russian rullet
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:58:54 Hmm... if i had no otehr choice
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:35 As i said, if i were forced into that situation
the-dump 2020-11-26 01:59:43 id take savign some lieves over non
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:00 But i dotn think *you* gte it
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:07 This is a video
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:13 of another individual
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:21 doign a totally seperate action
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:28 and your tryign to force me
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:38 ...
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:00:55 If your askign how i would feel?
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:04 I would be panicked, and filled with adrelanine
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:07 however
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:26 i would not say that he's riskign my life
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:01:55 All i can do is trust
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:00 and im fine with that
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:13 also
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:16 drifitng is a thing
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:21 to take tigth corners
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:26 so tahst a dumn argument
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:02:47 > you plead to god to be kept safe
Im aethiest
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:01 Darmagon3, Ill tell you this one
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:03 final
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:04 time
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:16 the whole poting of taht video
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:18 was NOT
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:32 the sufferign of the passengers (at least for me it wasn't)
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:03:39 but the skill of teh driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:04:39 The real question is
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:04:52 who was crzy enough to film the whole thing
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:05:06 i belive the caption are not a result of it being a meme
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:05:09 but ratehr
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:05:22 a result of whoever intially published teh video
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:06:12 Yes, which is quite reckless no?
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:06:22 you have a busful of witnesses
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:06:33 against 1 driver
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:03 Youd be suprised'
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:07:06 but they can
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:04 > Reasonably you could tell a group of 24 people to randomly go after a bus driver
This inetself is unlikely
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:13 but
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:08:26 wait what are we talkign about again
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:04 It certainly isnt casual
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:11 the drivign itself is extreame
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:17 i didnt say its ok
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:20 at what point
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:22 did i say
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:26 taht what he did
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:09:27 was ok
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:22 Its more a moral beatdown than anything else
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:10:54 yes
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:08 but returnign to the original point of our
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:10 freindly
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:13 discussion
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:11:52 I do not approve of his action, although i do somewhat admire his skill. Nonetheless, this is technically dark humor
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:05 is it ok?
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:06 no
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:18 yoiu have no idea
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:38 dark humor can go so far as the joking of ones death
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:12:55 go ahead, however
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:05 ive seen this video befor
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:23 > the humor falls off when it is no longer funny
thsi is relative
the-dump 2020-11-26 02:13:46 > mentally sane human
This is also relative, but I would lean to agree
