the-dump 2022-01-05 22:48:07 it do be a mini nuke
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:51:59 well
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:52:09 what i do is set them to a button on my keyboard
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:53:09 i really just set the buttons to a button i hardly use on my keyboard
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:54:49 i have a logitech mouse so i can make its buttons to be a button on my keyboard like i set to for example letter A and when i type i press the button on my mouse if im typing and then it will show up there (if this makes no sense tell me what you dont understand)
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:55:26 well what type of mouse ya got
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:56:05 (also what i did for my mouse is i downloaded a software that allows me to custimize my mouse)
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:56:59 maybe search up "how to change the side buttons on my mouse to ones on my keyboard" or something like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:57:55 well do "how to change the side buttons on my IBUYPOWER mouse to ones on my keyboard" to be more specific

plane-crazy 2022-07-25 03:41:03 i was using locked motors on my 7K block build to fold and the motors would keep glitching and like tp back to their old position messing with the other motors on that section and eventually "**Disconnected** You have been kicked due to unexpected client behavior"
