plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:16:58 It's not surprising, tanks are slow
general 2020-06-22 21:29:46 Lol what?
general 2020-06-22 21:30:12 Someone did stain it-
general 2020-06-22 21:30:27 How dare they
bug-reports 2020-06-22 21:30:59 Sad.
general 2020-06-22 21:34:16 Well orange juice is real sticky! They have to clean it up... I don't like sticky messes...
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:50:42 If you're making a jagged one, yes. If your making a round one, no.
the-dump 2020-06-22 21:51:34 Why?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 21:57:40 Yes. I'm real scared...
bug-reports 2020-06-22 22:35:26 Nah, your heli is one that bends space time. That's normal
creations-chat 2020-06-22 22:38:54 Second one
creations-chat 2020-06-23 00:02:16 Yes.
general 2020-06-23 00:13:40 > we need more wedges
Give. Them. Wedges.
general 2020-06-23 00:20:40 Oh nice
creations-chat 2020-06-23 00:27:02 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:30:22 > Make a anchored block with a motor on top with unpowered, then put a normal block on top, then add 2 suspension at max length and max stiffness and put normal blocks on the end of those. On the normal blocks put 2 in one direction and 2 in the opposite direction for the other, then put super rocket engines on the back and add lava spitters on the 2 blocks to make a force field
<@607098626153644032> Sounds cool and all... But can we see a picture next time? It'll save us all trouble. <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:38:25 That's pretty cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:39:31 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:39:57 Oh no... That would for sure do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:40:14 I can already imagination what that does
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 00:43:46 Lol, that'll make people back away

the-dump 2020-06-23 16:16:38 Oh no
general 2020-06-23 19:15:48 The thumbs down one looks like he broke his wrist to do it.
help 2020-06-23 19:19:46 Sounds like your vehicle's suspension needs tweaking. I recommend changing the damping if you haven't already
the-dump 2020-06-23 19:22:45 Oh frick
the-dump 2020-06-23 19:22:55 I forget about that image
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:12:32 Yeah I think that's about right
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:13:52 I mean, at least they are slower than shredders
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:14:08 Epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:24:09 Try adjusting damping
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 01:24:17 That might help
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 15:28:32 Build one dude

plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:15:33 Maybe you should add some wings in the back, that should help. Like mini ones

creations-chat 2020-09-06 00:52:26 Wth? That's just insanity in it's purest form
creations-chat 2020-09-06 00:54:07 That sounds like some weird challenge
the-dump 2020-09-06 11:25:54 If only Nasa knew
help 2020-09-06 16:39:54 Sounds like janky Roblox physics to me
help 2020-09-06 16:40:21 And also I've seen people having those problems for some reason
help 2020-09-06 16:44:14 Well, I don't particularly know. But if you look at <#498473314445033472>, a lot of them are reporting moter 2 for being buggy
help 2020-09-06 16:45:57 Well, you can limit its motion
help 2020-09-06 16:46:22 And I don't think it has to follow your mouse
help 2020-09-06 16:47:17 Sorry what?
help 2020-09-06 16:49:05 I've heard one that too
help 2020-09-06 16:49:18 Yeah
help 2020-09-06 16:50:10 I don't think so, I feel like this might be Roblox's fault in some way
help 2020-09-06 16:51:45 Well maybe they messed up something in the code? They gotta soft code the game so we don't have these issues
help 2020-09-06 16:53:17 Well, we'll see if it goes away sometime soon

bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:54:33 I am unable to get the snow blaster because the red button is not opening. (I am on mobile, results might be different on computer)
bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:59:05 Yeah, it's not working. Are you on mobile?
bug-reports 2020-12-17 02:59:44 Yep, that's probably why. I have the same problem.
bug-reports 2020-12-17 03:00:03 So it's not a one time occurrence
bug-reports 2020-12-17 03:00:13 Good to know.
