creations-chat 2020-10-07 23:58:54 I want to say that the person who copied my flying aircraft carrier, if you see this message immediately stops playing Plane Crazy if you have too much to ask my permission before copying me

creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:00:27 
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:01:54 I'm not talking about helping him but about my construction
creations-chat 2020-10-08 00:03:01 I don't know but a person came to tell me that I had been copied
bot-central 2020-10-10 18:28:12 -mapsuggest it would be cool that we vote for the best construction and that the winner would be put as status in the map
creations-chat 2020-11-05 19:57:23 the construction is beautiful but it's the vehicle that I don't like
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:20:09 I don't like pixel art I just don't know a truck to do in plane crazy I think m but otherwise it is beautiful
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:21:41 yeah its not because I put a negative vote that is not born beautiful it pleases other reason
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:32:28 with the jetpack we go up constantly and I try to deactivate the jetpack and reactivate it but it does nothing
bug-reports 2020-12-17 19:33:11 do not work
bug-reports 2020-12-20 19:59:46 I remind you that it has a bug with the jetpack we constantly go up I try to kill myself or deactivate and reactivate the jetpack but it does not work
bug-reports 2020-12-20 20:00:11 
creations-chat 2020-12-20 21:21:32 no I have the ultimate proof that it is boring
creations-chat 2020-12-20 21:35:34 do you have a thing with the tanks i feel like i just saw her in the creation lounge
bug-reports 2020-12-20 22:12:41 yes the same the jetpack does not work correctly since the christmas update
bug-reports 2020-12-21 00:05:23 FederalExpress look to see if you have an engine that is attached to a block that should not be
bug-reports 2020-12-21 17:07:06 I repeat but it has a bug on the jetpack we just go up and I try to reactivate it and activate it or kill me my its not working
bot-central 2020-12-27 17:23:51 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-12-27 17:28:11 & suggest make a new block which would become invisible when launching the creation.

I know he has the camera but the problem is that when you use the camera for his your C key becomes overloaded so you can use it
creations-chat 2021-01-09 23:32:34 good I have a question WHY the boat has 37 I like then that the only beautiful part is its hull (dsl to say its to your boat is beautiful but on the boat it is not beautiful) and that the vessel of star wars has only 10 I like with 11 I don't even though his ship is super beautiful and well made
creations-chat 2021-01-09 23:35:25 I don't speak english so I use google translate
creations-chat 2021-01-09 23:37:28 and I like both it's just that I find it unfair that one has 37 I like while the other is more beautiful and has 11 I don'tüòü

bot-central 2021-01-14 14:52:18 <#507673335816126509> it would be cool to have a gamepass where you can control your ship remotely.

Its would be a button like the jetpack but when we press the button we could no longer move our character and we would control our ship. It would be like we're on an invisible seat that spawns on us when we push the button
