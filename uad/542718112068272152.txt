help 2020-01-13 16:34:23 What is a conveyor engine
help 2020-01-13 16:34:31 And a piston conveyor drive
general 2020-02-02 18:51:32 I have just designed an epic plane
general 2020-02-02 18:51:51 It has four triangle shaped wings, two on each side
general 2020-02-02 18:52:01 It’s sort of like a tie fighter
general 2020-02-02 18:52:09 But the pod in the middle rotates.
general 2020-02-02 18:52:16 When it’s on the ground
general 2020-02-02 18:52:35 The legs rotate to a walking position and act like a four-legged walker.
general 2020-02-02 18:53:20 Feed back welcome
general 2020-02-02 18:57:21 No
bug-reports 2020-02-07 16:18:27 I made a plane that has it’s wings attached with a quad-walker system and rotators so the wings can swivel down and it can start walking, but as soon as I spawn, the wings start glitching out like crazy and going through each other, often having it glitch away into the sky. Any idea why this is happening? I only have motors and pistons.
bug-reports 2020-02-07 16:18:36 It’s really annoying
bug-reports 2020-02-08 00:28:56 Also, I bet most of you have noticed that the parachutes (at least the player ones) are seriously bugged, flinging the player to their deaths after a few seconds. Turning off ragdoll only delays this for a good ten seconds. I would love to see this fixed.

general 2020-02-08 18:39:51 The only problem with having lots of blocks is server lag
