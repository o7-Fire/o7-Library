creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:46:36 Thanks, I made it for my friend.
I have the standard DeLorean, he has the TIme Machine.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:52:42 (forgot the image) SEE THE MOTor LOCKING I'VE DEALT WITH?
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:54:45 It's hard to cram enough detail into something with this much locking.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 22:57:33 I tried my best, hell. I spent 6+ hours on it. I make these kinds of things for my friend all the time. Like I built a 2500+ blocks Mario's odyssey for him once.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 23:06:07 I think I know what I'm doing.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 23:41:38 I can't fit any motor angles without affecting aerodynamics.

bug-reports 2021-01-08 01:01:48 I can do that???
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:38:04 ;-;
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:40:05 I'm so upset over people downvoting it, I worked hard on it and while its the least impressive thing I've built, I expect some sorts of enjoyment. But fine, I'll stick to building impressive mechs >:C
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:42:52 I think I'm done posting my stuff here, people can't seem to refrain from providing too negative feedback. I mean, recommending fixes and improvements is fine. And letting me know of your thoughts and beliefs is fine too. I have nothing against it, but this is too harsh. I tried taking a break from the complex and detailed things in this game and make something funny. But all I get is a slap in the face. Its so disappointing.
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:45:27 Why don't I put you in my place? See how it feels. Also, <@!559568621312147476> I tried making one that was relative to scale of the avatar. I wanted  to make it look as if it's not an oversized monster that makes it impractical.
creations-chat 2021-05-22 12:49:59 I've tried motor locking, I made an impressive delorean once, uploaded it here and got this same response from everyone.

Nevermind, I relaunched and they appear.
