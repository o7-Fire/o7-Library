plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:49:23 I mean at least tell him why
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 23:51:42 Maybe but hitting the max is probably pushing it already
the-dump 2020-09-02 00:03:27 Don't you just hate it when your creation spontaneously turns into a solar system?

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:52:51 *Wheeze*
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:54:08 If you can't kill the bug, take out your 20k block boat and kill their frames.
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:55:01 There's nothing like forcing a bug to leave because their game froze
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:55:48 My highest is a 13k quad-fold but I want to hit 20k
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 05:13:54 About as useful as the helicopter itself
general 2020-09-13 17:29:41 She has no right to be angry with aim like that
general 2020-09-13 17:30:08 igg
general 2020-09-13 17:30:08 Because she was mad
general 2020-09-13 17:30:21 Should've broken the mouse though
general 2020-09-13 17:31:02 She flicked too hard when she started firing. It almost looks intentional...

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 17:47:49 Well then why'd you ask
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 17:48:29 Bruh you're the one without the ideas here
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 17:48:38 We're just giving some concepts
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 17:48:58 Why not
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:47:42 ngl the problem with most A-10 builds is that they aren't building the plane around the gun, which is how you're supposed to build it.
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:49:17 But tbf it is a kinda ugly plane
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:50:34 Its only purpose is getting that main gun above the enemy and blasting them, and it does that pretty dang well
creations-chat 2020-09-15 13:52:05 I think it flies on like 1 engine and 1 wing
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:11 Linkage
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:30 Well you have it right there
creations-chat 2020-09-16 15:18:31 So like

creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:28:42 Wus wrong with cylinders?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 03:14:37 Full of water?

creations-chat 2020-09-17 05:23:02 I'd say stack giant plates and fold them out in a spiral but that may leave unwanted gaps in the art

creations-chat 2020-09-17 19:05:44 And people still don't use it

plane-crazy 2021-05-30 15:24:14 Anyone know if autostabilizers work sideways?
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 15:25:58 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 15:46:00 A device that keeps objects in a singular orientation, sort of like a gyro
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:40:54 Anyone know what causes a build to not fully load in?
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:43:01 No, not the corruption thing. I mean when you spawn in a build and the whole thing loads, but the seat is broken and it loses all functionality.
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:43:51 My fuel bar is literally labeled "Speed"
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:10 Darn alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:13 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:22 Oh I actually crashed
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:40 it usually happens when I try and spawn a boat in water
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:45 I won't even load into the seat
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 15:44:50 But now it's happening at my base
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:03:49 I often forget to turn up my graphics because I have to run other games at specific settings
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:06:12 10 different pictures of the same plane sounds wholly unnecessary
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:28:01 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:41:21 https://streamable.com/q5y1ug
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:41:30 Can someone explain
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:42:32 I did but the bug itself was wild
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:49:55 My fastest jet reaches about 650 top speed and then goes 700+ when the wings come off
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 19:55:23 Take all your naval builds and make them fly

creations-chat 2021-06-04 23:41:01 Fabric being the lightest material keeps me from having to use... ugh.. Helium. Also yes, fabric has a high contrast which makes it way easier to build with. Eventually I'll get it down to diamond plate but this is a very early version as you can tell with the test flight.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 23:43:57 Ice is way too bright, I'm mostly building at night. 

Just trying to see how I can improve the plane's handling besides improving my own pilot skills
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:11:16 Would've gotten 100+ upvotes if he just called it an A-10 and nothing else. All you really need is the gun.

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:23:27 Use wing panels for giant flying ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:24:31 Most flying ships are just blocks that fall really slowly with directional control
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:24:46 If you put in enough panels, you won't fall at all.

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:30:31 Yes but food has real variety and surprise factor

Jets are just fast flying doritos with guns attached..
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:31:02 I can't find that interesting anymore
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:31:22 I already make spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:31:51 I'm on mobile but if you give me some... 8 hours or so I'll get back home lol

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:34:18 My most recent build is a... I think it was a 35k block space carrier that I'm using to experiment with compact plane design
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 12:58:15 It's just hard to build something new because everything else feels unfinished
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:33:40 My question is if it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:46:45 Why do people care about armor when half the builds in the game are completely unhittable
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:06:27 Sounds like what someone on 1000 ping would say
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:28:27 Oh hey I finally loaded up pc to finish my carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:37:08 https://streamable.com/7ewt7b

<@!581412939223924767> sorry for the ping, here's that carrier I was talking to you like a week ago about

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:37:58 Wanted to see if I could put a flying thing in another flying thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:39:18 Tbh you'd have to make a carrier specifically for landing an arsenal bird
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:40:07 The sheer width required on the runway would be absurd
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:40:21 You might as well just land it sideways on a normal carrier now that I think about it
general 2021-08-11 00:14:12 huh

general 2021-08-11 00:46:10 Alright geez

general 2021-08-11 00:50:40 Tf is a prtsc
general 2021-08-11 00:50:50 Oh
general 2021-08-11 00:51:16 It's made almost purely out of individual blocks
general 2021-08-11 00:51:47 You know rejoining the game refreshes block count, right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:29:57 I just despawned it...
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:30:06 And lagged out hold on

plane-crazy 2021-08-12 20:34:55 For a joint
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 22:51:34 My savedata keeps rolling back is there anyway to fix that?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:11:13 I've been building one particular device all day today, and over the course of over tens of thousands of blocks, my data has been getting rolled back to the original save every time I leave and rejoin the game

My username is Janitorette and it's particularly affecting the one build I have in my 13th slot as well as any data in every single other slot. I literally cannot save content in the game.

Is some practical easter egg joke with 13 being an unlucky number or is Plane Crazy just screwing me over rn?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:30:27 I did and I always do
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:30:41 Even autosave doesn't work because the entire datastore is rolled back
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:00 I'm on pc and no, the data storage isn't full
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:07 It's a little over halfway at best
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:31:13 And it's affecting every slot
bug-reports 2021-08-13 02:33:04 No my pc is perfectly fine, but my data is being rolled back
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:07:31 I can't until tomorrow, but I will first thing
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:07:58 Take a picture of my datastore..
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:08:25 Tomorrow?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:08:45 Technically today
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:09:34 Okay but is there a point to this?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:10:14 Yes, I'm experiencing a game breaking bug that has cost me 9 hours of progress today
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:10:56 Because the data is being rolled back whenever I leave the game and rejoin
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:12:25 Change servers/log off/switch to pvp
bug-reports 2021-08-13 05:13:12 Please get off of bug reports there are actual problems here
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:27:37 The question is if it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:28:00 Alright you can stop
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:28:08 No more
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:28:41 And I used to wonder why I don't build planes..
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:30:42 But why would you need anything other than a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:32:02 If only I could complete my mother of all shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:32:14 The lord has punished me by erasing my save data 3 times
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:32:34 I have
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:38:44 Stop you're using too many wing panels for the wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:53:35 Can you make it... Bigger?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 15:33:51 Alright here's the storage
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:36:46 Wha
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:36:51 But it's not full?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 16:46:14 So in other words, I might already be maxed out on data?
bug-reports 2021-08-13 17:18:52 So I don't actually have as much space as the numbers initially say I do?
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:12:58 https://streamable.com/fv1zv7

bug-reports 2022-07-21 18:27:49 You don't have as much save space as it says. Try deleting a few builds to clear it up, and only use one slot next time.
