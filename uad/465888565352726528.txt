plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:13:58 and im in a bit of trouble with how i would implement the guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:14:00 and wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:14:21 i would send a image but cant do that rn

plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:14:31 lOL
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:14:41 what would be the motor 2 settings then

plane-crazy 2021-10-19 09:24:56 on a plane thats not fully done yet. its easier for me to do the important parts first then balance it in the end
