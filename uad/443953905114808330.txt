plane-crazy 2020-02-07 03:34:29 > i'm the only one that **hates** the <#504436696021204992> ? Its because u **CAN'T** post a joke creation, like a meme vehicle, like if i made Thanos car just for kidding everyone will try to find something bad on it, idk why the people at <#504436696021204992> can't understand a joke, they always see the creations as a competition, it looks like they don't play the game for fun but like a "job", i know i can be wrong because i left this server 1 year ago and just came back now, but when i posted my meme creations i got a lot of upvotes but know if i post a meme creation i will get tons of downvotes
