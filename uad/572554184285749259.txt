plane-crazy 2020-09-10 21:51:34 <@!257624380291547146>  fixed makes the smoke particles spin
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:53:32 thats what i mean
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:54:10 i can see using a tutorial to learn game mechanics but just straight up copying a plane completly is kinda trashy
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:54:58 yes
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:56:15 i especially hate it when somebody builds like say a tankfish tutorial, and then say its their own design
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:56:31 ok
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:57:25 ikr
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:58:02 i was in a public server once and they had that one tankfish mech and made it green instead of red and said it was theirs
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:58:33 ?
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:58:45 oh the wiki thing?
the-dump 2020-09-10 21:59:22 i doubt it
the-dump 2020-09-10 22:00:11 also <@!627645793343635457>  why do you have to be so defensive about tutorials?
the-dump 2020-09-10 22:02:23 look up ^^^

the-dump 2020-09-10 22:06:04 especially if thats all they do for youtube
the-dump 2020-09-10 22:07:05 you realize most of them do it for money right
the-dump 2020-09-10 22:09:21 tankfish stopped posting tutorials once the views dropped and hes the main person people go for when they want to build a tutorial

creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:44:08 pretty good for a build with 0 motor lock, on a scale of builds without motor lock, 7/10, on a build in general, 4/10
creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:47:16 I cant see it that well, but on the upper front add the hole with the gun in it from the model, and if your going to make it a 1x1 hole, use flares as the barrel of the gun but If you can make the hole bigger I would reccomend using cylinders and a smoke pipe at the end

but overall just add some more details using half blocks and other small blocks to get smaller details
creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:49:18 make a 1x1 hole and use flares as a barrel

eunsoo55 I need a picture lmao
creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:52:44 that works but yeah other than that Just use more blocks from half blocks section and wedges 2 section to get smoother and better looks
creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:56:10 and?? I didnt mean for the whole body, I meant smaller details like the guns and the radar dish thingy on the top, Im trying to help you, no need to get annoyed about it.

help 2020-12-09 04:59:48 can I submit a helicopter for an aeronauticle rank?
creations-chat 2020-12-09 05:02:48 no, people can make really good builds without motor lock, and If they can make it look good I give more respect to the people who dont take the easy way out and make themselves a challenge by not using motor lock, take rbk321 for example. he make extremly good builds without using motor lock, one of them even got into hof: https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/763099899373420554

but If you just want to make a really good looking build motor lock is the easyiest way to get the angles perfect, and get the block count up for ranks 😎
creations-chat 2020-12-09 05:04:59 without motor lock you just have to build big so you can make the angles easier

***also i dont know why this cooldown is 2 minutes***

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:19:51 the rear vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:03 he was drifting with the rear vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:40 yeah he was drifting with vert stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:21:32 or I guess he was using the "rudder" of the plane is the technical word
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:21:45 but the rudder is attached to the vert stabilzer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:22:20 that doesnt look like the same plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:23:53 he was drifting using the rudder, you can clearly see it in the video
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:24:48 you can see the split between the rudder an the vert stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:25:57 racing drones are best for dogfights 😎

help 2021-08-05 04:18:34 https://medal.tv/clips/60461831/d1337zcjNBJQ
why do my rockets do this and how do i fix it, when I tested them the first time they worked fine but when I joined another server they started doing this
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:20:47 I was on a vip server with just me and my friend and it still had the rocket issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:22:57 that sucks
help 2021-08-05 04:27:43 ok thank you for helping
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:28:33 I found out how to fix it, if you put a motor on toggle connected to your rocket it constantly updates the rocket and it doesnt freeze
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:29:12 im using a hover drive and it worked for me it might be different if your using somthing other than a hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:30:22 for now thats the way to fix it ig
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 04:30:34 not unless you toggle the motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:01:52 it is considered a truck, gl in the contest

creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:53:31 the picture quality.
creations-chat 2021-08-13 12:57:54 maybe a more accurate paintjob? some round windows on the side would be more accurate. more rounded edges, more details on the engines and actually add engine intakes
