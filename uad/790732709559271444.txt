plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:16:09 <@!670939038999511041> your idea isnt original
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:16:36 doesnt mean you think you can copyright it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:17:04 have you done that exact same thing to everyone else who has posted something like that
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:17:31 there is no one that exists
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:17:32 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:17:37 nobody exists anymore

general 2020-12-22 01:19:10 \/
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:19:28 explain yourself then
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:20:00 it's stupid to ask someone to explain themselves just for posting something similar to something you did as if you're copyright claiming them
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:20:36 you are always the only person with an actual rank to do this
general 2020-12-22 01:20:48 <:ElonDisapprove:589136548356685837>
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:21:45 ok so placing a block on the bridge with a missing segment = copying your idea that you completely came up by yourself and therefore anyone else who even does something similar is considered copying YOUR IDEA and nobody else's
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:21:54 good logic
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:22:37 that's a stupid concept
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:22:55 why would anyone make an aircraft carrier after someone already made one and posted it in <#384025409945337856> ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:23:33 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:23:37 there is a difference
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:23:39 you said
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:23:45 this
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:24:06 sounds very broad to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:24:22 'why would you make something that has already been made'
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:24:49 you used the '1 block' as an example
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:24:56 you realize what you said right
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:06 your main point is 'why make something if it has already been made'
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:15 which I also gave an example for
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:25 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:33 an aircraft carrier is similar to another aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:45 then say that
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:49 you never said that before
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:26:04 doesnt mean anything
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:26:34 if you are just going to state something that was never stated before and act like i'm the one that's dumb then you need to check your memory
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:00 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:10 what makes you think coolboitorb knew about your build
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:19 and then purposefully posted it again
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:25 maybe he, idk, didn't know?
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:36 i never knew you did
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:43 do you think everyone saw your post
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:47 and never forgot about it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:52 and always knew you made that
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:57 and always knew you came up with the idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:28:04 sounds pretty egotistical to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:28:35 <:ElonDisapprove:589136548356685837>
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:09 so basically herrguggi is saying that anyone who has a similar idea to him is actually just copying him
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:15 true logic and facts right there
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:21 can't dispute that
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:29 show me how he copied you
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:37 show me specifically how he copied you in order to get upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:51 since that's the only reason why copying is not allowed
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:08 the only reason why copying is not allowed is because people will farm upvotes off of somebody else's hard work
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:29 why do you care so much about him copying your *meme build*
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:35 you stated it yourself
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:38 it's a meme build
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:44 therefore nobody should care
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:53 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:00 because you keep making this stuff happen
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:09 and i'm just trying to point out how you always start it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:19 i did but idc
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:23 you can stop at any moment
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:27 like right now
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:40 but you aren't stopping
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:48 therefore you are contributing to the problem you just pointed out
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:33:00 you always act this dumb
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:33:11 no

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:00:48 just
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:00:50 use pontoons
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:00:52 easy float
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:01:34 wat
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:01:38 inside the hull of course
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:02:26 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:03:04 not in the middle tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:03:12 near the sides
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:03:15 but still on the inside
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:04:57 actually you can use pontoons in the middle but they just wont help with stability is what i meant
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:05:40 its easy once you get the hang of it
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:06:29 you realize you dont have to assign different keybinds to all of the joints right
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:06:54 if you wanted a fully controllable mech then yes it is like that but a mech that walks is easy
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:07:12 imagine pvp <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:38:53 but a lot of other ships seem to have a much higher part count when compared to their size
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:41:40 yamato is probably the ship that everyone messes up
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:41:44 mostly beginners
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:41:46 but still
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:41:59 only ever seen 2 good yamatos
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:42:09 a lot of them are wack

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:42:21 mainly the stern

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 21:05:04 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 21:05:33 yeah makes more sense though non curved sails make it look worse overall
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 21:05:37 you can do wrapped sails

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 21:06:00 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 21:06:32 if its not on a fold you can try using camera lock to make curved sails

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:15:56 practical
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:16:08 you mainly just guess yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:16:31 i mean if you make your planes look similar to how they look irl then it should actually fly very well without even needing to adjust it yet
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:16:49 that's how it worked for me
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:16:59 i made folding planes a long time ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:17:08 they didnt need much adjustment
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:17:11 when i added engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:17:24 then you just chose the wrong plane to build
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:01 sure but that means its your plane that had the problem
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:12 mine usually needs only a few adjustments
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:19 like only slowly pitching up or down
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:24 but it flies on the first try
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:18:52 sure but where'd be the engineering genius in that <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:21 its fine as it is rn and rick doesnt want to increase plot size cause people can lag the server even more easily that way
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:42 and plus if you plan to build something large then you should have the skill to fold something
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:50 otherwise we would just see giant boxes everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:54 not all of them but ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:19:57 you're generalizing
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:20:12 also it depends on where you place your engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:20:21 maybe you place your engines somewhere else than i do usually
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 22:20:24 idk

creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:24:04 people just have higher standards in here, and like you said, everyone starts out with simple builds, so they're of course not going to get a lot of upvotes. the main difference is how people feel when they get downvoted, some people feel it's very harsh, other people don't care as much and learn to only post the best creations they've made since they expect to be received with extreme scrutiny and criticism
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:28:01 then all you have to do is build more, if you don't want to then you don't have to
though personally sometimes people do just have a skill ceiling

plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:44:51 thats an issue with client to server side connections
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:44:57 has always existed

plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:46:41 those are the bullets that are yellow for everyone else
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:46:54 the yellow bullets are the ones you see
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:00 and the ones that arent laggy
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:08 which means they are clientside
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:15 but damage from them is still seen on your own screen
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:47:32 while other people only see the damage from your red bullets which are perceived as yellow bullets on their end
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:12 it's existed for years
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:19 madattak was the one to code the guns
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:25 and he hasnt been able to fix it for years
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:32 and rickje doesnt know how to fix it either
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:44 so either he makes a new gun or it is kept as is
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:51 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:48:56 but maybe rickje doesnt know how
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:49:02 cause madattak certainly cant help him
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:49:09 actually he can but he wont be willing to

general 2021-01-08 00:59:34 tea leaves are crushed up and placed into tea bags; vegetables may typically be cut but not crushed into almost powder form in order to be added to soup
general 2021-01-08 01:00:22 there are different ways of making tea however the most common form would be crushed tea leaves placed inside of tea bags
general 2021-01-08 01:00:40 other than the fact it has no meat

general 2021-01-08 01:04:09 explain to me
general 2021-01-08 01:04:37 you can start with stock and it can just be heated up to below boiling temperature
general 2021-01-08 01:05:03 it says 'typically made by boiling ingredients'
general 2021-01-08 01:05:07 notice 'typically'
general 2021-01-08 01:05:32 you cannot ignore all but only the common cases
general 2021-01-08 01:06:08 a soup is really just a liquid dish as defined by google if you remove the 'typically boiled' part

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:28:06 what
general 2021-01-08 17:28:39 never bring a gun to a knife fight
general 2021-01-08 17:28:44 you will be stabbed horribly
general 2021-01-08 17:29:04 i mean a knife would probably be better
general 2021-01-08 17:29:18 dont bring a sword to a gun fight
general 2021-01-08 17:29:23 but dont bring a gun to a knife fight
general 2021-01-08 17:29:38 since with a knife you have to close the distance and stab multiple times
general 2021-01-08 17:30:10 with a sword, you fight at arms length distance so the person with a gun has a better chance of drawing and hitting you
general 2021-01-08 17:30:16 with a knife you just run at them and stab them to death
general 2021-01-08 17:30:43 regular knife is more controllable than a bayonet on a weapon
general 2021-01-08 17:31:13 rapiers are just sharpened fencing blades
general 2021-01-08 17:31:46 sure but a knife is better either way
general 2021-01-08 17:31:59 a bayonet is just a knife on a gun
general 2021-01-08 17:32:34 well nobody would bring a butter knife to fight
general 2021-01-08 17:32:35 so no
general 2021-01-08 17:32:39 unreasonable
general 2021-01-08 17:32:48 you are
general 2021-01-08 17:32:50 so you would
general 2021-01-08 17:33:04 caliber doesnt matter in a knife fight
general 2021-01-08 17:33:13 you'll get stabbed to death anyway
general 2021-01-08 17:33:49 you would need to bring a 5 lb neodymium magnet to prevent a knife attack
general 2021-01-08 17:34:31 a longer knife not always best unless your opponent is using a speck of glass as a knife
general 2021-01-08 17:34:41 ok
general 2021-01-08 17:35:01 using a spear in a knife fight will get you killed
general 2021-01-08 17:35:10 unless you start from like a 50 m distance
general 2021-01-08 17:35:25 you realize you cant use a spear when a person is stabbing you 0.2 ft in front of you
general 2021-01-08 17:35:33 like

general 2021-01-08 17:35:41 like caesar
general 2021-01-08 17:35:58 same thing would happen with a gun
general 2021-01-08 17:36:03 no time to pull it out and tase them
general 2021-01-08 17:36:10 they'll have killed you by then
general 2021-01-08 17:36:21 thats what i just said
general 2021-01-08 17:36:34 using a taser is like using a gun
general 2021-01-08 17:36:39 you will still be stabbed to death

general 2021-01-09 20:51:14 how do you use disconnectors for something that is in the middle

general 2021-01-09 20:51:27 like only a wing panel can fit there

general 2021-01-09 20:51:43 halfwedge
general 2021-01-09 20:52:04 so the half block below it would be on the left side of a block

general 2021-01-09 20:52:23 if it were there
general 2021-01-09 20:52:28 a gap

general 2021-01-09 20:52:40 do you not see the issue with using a disconnector for that
general 2021-01-09 20:52:48 i think you meant a wing panel
general 2021-01-09 20:52:56 if it's too thick then use a wing panel

general 2021-01-09 20:53:14 yes
general 2021-01-09 20:53:18 so replace with wing panel

general 2021-01-10 23:48:43 yes but they need to be aerodynamic for when they enter a planet's atmosphere
general 2021-01-10 23:49:02 no i mean it would be extremely unstable without horizontal stabilizers
general 2021-01-10 23:49:09 it would need canards to work like an actual plane
general 2021-01-10 23:49:48 the wings at the back are angled to provide vertical stability but not horizontal stabilization because they are the main wings
general 2021-01-10 23:50:13 canards would help it to work better than if none were added at all

general 2021-01-11 00:52:17 lever action
general 2021-01-11 00:52:18 i think
general 2021-01-11 00:52:21 45 70
general 2021-01-11 00:52:42 main thing in pf that stops me from getting many kills is ammo
general 2021-01-11 00:52:45 i keep running out of it
general 2021-01-11 00:52:51 too bad
general 2021-01-11 00:52:57 i get 100 kill in bad business
general 2021-01-11 00:53:04 cause i dont run out of ammo
general 2021-01-11 00:53:05 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-01-11 00:54:15 just play 1 round of bad business
general 2021-01-11 00:54:17 should be easy
general 2021-01-11 00:54:23 will take about

general 2021-01-11 00:55:26 probably
general 2021-01-11 00:56:18 depends what you like
general 2021-01-11 00:56:21 i vary a lot
general 2021-01-11 00:56:23 so i have no clue
general 2021-01-11 00:56:26 i used to like mp7
general 2021-01-11 00:56:29 and m4a1
general 2021-01-11 00:56:34 starting to less like g36
general 2021-01-11 00:56:37 but it liked it a lot in 2020
general 2021-01-11 00:56:47 my setup with aug gets 0 recoil
general 2021-01-11 00:56:48 just a laser
general 2021-01-11 00:56:54 but that means
general 2021-01-11 00:56:58 it doesnt feel powerful
general 2021-01-11 00:57:00 cant share
general 2021-01-11 00:57:03 aug a3 is good too
general 2021-01-11 00:57:16 also honey badger for close proximity rifle
general 2021-01-11 00:57:26 honey badger and shotguns work well in metro

general 2021-01-11 00:58:33 they are meh
general 2021-01-11 00:58:40 basically semi auto snipers without high damage
general 2021-01-11 00:59:05 sometimes i use p90 or mp5k
general 2021-01-11 00:59:06 for fun
general 2021-01-11 00:59:19 but ammo runs out quickly for p90
general 2021-01-11 00:59:35 and i use g18 for secondary for all setups
general 2021-01-11 00:59:40 either that or deagle/revolver

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:24 wait that's supposed to be the uss texas
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:31 ok i very likely will downvote now
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:47 doesn't look like it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:10:48 to be honest
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:08 i can just google it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:25 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:37 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:45 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:46 is this it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:11:59 my original thoughts still apply
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:12:25 its hard to give advice when all i have to say is 'doesnt look like the uss texas'
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:12:42 but the bow could definitely be changed to suit the hull better
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:09 long barrels
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:14 too long
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:26 2-3 probably
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:13:48 barrels are usually the same length as the turret itself, maybe slightly longer
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:20 sometimes shorter if they are below 10 inches
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:25 too long
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:46 wait what class is that
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:48 battleship
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:14:53 its definitely american
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:01 due to the turrets and radar
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:14 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:15 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:15:55 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:06 i was going to shorten the amount of distance between each barrel
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:11 cause it looks too wide
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:18 but that is what i have rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:19 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:22 too much motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:23 i will
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:25 attempt to
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:27 make them fully functional
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:31 except for the cannon
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:47 looks like you used none on yours
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:50 usually
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:51 cause
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:54 i never make videos
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:16:57 i just post images
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:14 https://gyazo.com/e12689f538218795a5f680dba236eebc
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:19 this was my old turret
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:20 from 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:24 no motor lock back then
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:26 but there's like
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:28 a huge amount of gaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:33 excruciating amount of gaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:53 yes but that was 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:17:58 even if i used motor lock it could work
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:02 but would still be kinda ugly
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:11 too big for my ship anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:22 yes but yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:24 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:32 yeah we have similar turrets
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:45 you can make them slanted if you really want to
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:46 but its fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:51 if you want it to still rotate
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:18:59 probably cant rotate if its angled like that anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:44 yeah but i mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:48 torpedoes arent too effective
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:49 at long range
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:19:59 battleships always fought at relatively long ranges
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:20:12 only destroyers and boats could go fast enough to not get hit and launch torpedoes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:20:56 though i mean torpedoes didnt hit their targets very often when fired by surface vessels since the enemy could just dodge
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:21:08 but that would mean you could make them go in circles
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:21:10 and go nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:21:36 probably most effective on the smallest boats
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:18 for those cannons
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:20 in the sides
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:22 forgot what they're called
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:28 but they eventually phased them out
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:32 well yeah secondaries
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:34 but uhh
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:38 more specific name
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:41 3d <@!629858706997248000>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:45 so i can actually see up close
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:23:53 though usually mine are slightly oversized
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:04 so i can make all the balconies able to be walked in
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:21 many secondaries ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:29 great white fleet paint is very good
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:48 couldnt get any thinner cannons without them being offset
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:52 but it was still 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:53 and yes it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:24:56 very fun to play
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:25:03 tier 3 battleship
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:25:12 it looks best with outlines
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:55 3 fold with another fold for superstructure
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:58 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:58 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:26:59 skjrtnhs
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:06 i keep assuming you are talking about california
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:14 since you only mention that ship when talking to me <@!322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:22 its a 3 fold
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:26 as in 3 pieces but 2 motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:48 california is 3 pieces but another big fold for superstructure
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:27:59 would be a good scene to recreate

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:06 i originally made turrets first tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:09 but that was 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:20 i made the basic fold and ship hull outline a long time ago
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:26 only recently started to fill it in
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:55 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:29:58 only for a few weeks
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:30:13 and ive been inactive for long periods of time

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:31:46 if they are made in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:31:56 the spiral towers are extremely hard to replicate
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:31:59 nobody makes them correctly
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:06 they're either square or just full on cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:20 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:22 forgot their names
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:28 yamato or bismarck or titanic
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:32 you'd need multiple
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:50 these
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:32:58 hard to replicate
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:07 nobody has made them correctly
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:20 most people
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:22 just make them square
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:27 instead of making them cylindrical
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:30 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:36 those are basically just hollow stairs
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:47 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:51 not yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:33:57 you can use motor lock to make longer wedges tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:00 so there are less
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:01 bumps
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:15 smooth hull yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:19 it is a u boat

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:34:57 probably or probably not
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:04 pearl harbor?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:15 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:25 but i did want to make pearl harbor scene
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:35:30 with ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:36:02 i could make a very quick change to my turrets and i'd get the uss west virginia

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:43 and because technology is cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:49 but too cool = overrated
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:51 and therefore uncool
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:48:58 but uncool = underrated and cool again
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 07:49:00 and the cycle continues

general 2021-01-13 04:15:55 yours is
general 2021-01-13 04:15:59 iowa is battleship
general 2021-01-13 04:16:12 why would it need a heli then
general 2021-01-13 04:16:15 not every ship has a helipad
general 2021-01-13 04:16:26 plus a ww2 modernized cruiser usually gets missiles instead of helipads
general 2021-01-13 04:16:33 and you kept your turrets
general 2021-01-13 04:16:35 instead of using missiles
general 2021-01-13 04:16:39 which is not modernized
general 2021-01-13 04:16:42 it be outdated
general 2021-01-13 04:16:49 they replace the turrets

general 2021-01-13 22:41:48 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-01-13 22:43:08 if the person was in motion you could probably have one of the limbs just not be touching the ground so that the viewer would know that it's not meant to look like a pose
general 2021-01-13 22:43:28 the only part of the image that looks like the person is in motion is the hair
general 2021-01-13 22:43:34 and that could just be attributed to wind
general 2021-01-13 22:43:46 so there's not much that can be used to tell that they are in motion
general 2021-01-13 22:44:44 also if they are in motion why would their gun hand be pointing up like the person is  expecting to be in a picture or something

general 2021-01-14 00:17:52 if you add more middle fingers you would still have 2 middle fingers
general 2021-01-14 00:20:17 no we would always have 1 middle finger on each hand cause we can just decide not to count the thumb whenever we want

general 2021-01-14 00:21:15 well if you dont count the thumb as a finger then adding 2 additional fingers would actually increase the amount of middle fingers you have from 0 to 2
general 2021-01-14 00:21:26 since middle fingers arent in the middle of the 4 fingers
general 2021-01-14 00:22:07 why

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:25:24 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:26:01 gonna be hard to make that camo without it being blocky
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:26:12 but with enough motor lock it is possible

plane-crazy 2021-01-17 03:43:10 no its exactly the same
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 03:43:15 as the safe chat for <13
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 03:43:46 if rickje implemented a system for detecting whether you are under 13 or not in order to swap between <13 safechat and regular safechat it would be better and still be allowed by roblox
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 03:44:17 but currently he hasnt done that so roblox will only allow <13 safechat for all signs due to the fact that the game doesnt have a system to differentiate between <13 and 13+ users
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 03:44:30 its been that way for <13 safechat for years

general 2021-01-18 01:17:49 dont car
general 2021-01-18 01:17:56 they dont
general 2021-01-18 01:18:16 but we count both bot vote when subtracting cause 1-1=0
general 2021-01-18 01:18:45 better to just subtract both values instead of trying to subtract 1 from both
general 2021-01-18 01:18:59 and then subtracting again
general 2021-01-18 01:26:05 well the owner of the carrier must request for hof himself since 99% of the image is his creation <@456226577798135808>

general 2021-01-18 01:27:30 any creation that has only barely enough upvotes to be requested for hof has a 90% probability to get rejected unless it was very recently posted and already got 75 upvotes

general 2021-01-18 01:28:25 how do you know the logo for whatsass

general 2021-01-18 01:29:18 it only has the watermark cause its not activated with official key
general 2021-01-18 01:29:26 but anyone can download unactivated windows 10 from microsoft
general 2021-01-18 01:29:33 literally offered by microsoft themselves
general 2021-01-18 01:29:53 how is it weird
general 2021-01-18 01:30:27 if you dont have windows 10 and you need to install it on a device immediately then they offer it to you for free so you can activate at a later date
general 2021-01-18 01:30:37 plus some features are disabled while windows 10 is unactivated
general 2021-01-18 01:30:50 also windows 10 is extremely widely used anyways
general 2021-01-18 01:30:55 they dont miss out on much profit

plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:09:09 use rockets facing sideways as rcs to try keeping it stable in flight
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:09:29 the wing panels help to prevent it from going in unpredictable directions
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:09:42 with the wing panels you'll always know that the rocket will slowly tilt in one direction or another
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:10:04 using control surfaces as fins to control your rocket is nowhere near as effective in plane crazy as it is in ksp
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:10:21 so rcs is your next best choice
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:11:07 it will probably be pretty confusing when trying to use rcs but at least you'll be able to keep your rocket somewhat straight when flying instead of your rocket flipping over 20 seconds into launch

general 2021-01-18 22:14:53 asphalt ripoff
general 2021-01-18 22:15:12 then forza is too
general 2021-01-18 22:15:20 considering forza is an asphalt ripoff
general 2021-01-18 22:15:58 asphalt has succumbed to the virus of the mobile free to play scheme
general 2021-01-18 22:16:02 but then again what game hasn't
general 2021-01-18 22:16:16 minecraft isn't free to play
general 2021-01-18 22:16:59 minecraft isn't a free to play mobile game
general 2021-01-18 22:17:13 it was a rhetorical question anyways
general 2021-01-18 22:17:42 i specified what types of games with the previous sentence but it was a rhetorical question so it wasn't meant to be a question that was easy to answer
general 2021-01-18 22:17:50 asphalt 7 or 6 for me
general 2021-01-18 22:18:02 yes indeed it was a rhetorical question
general 2021-01-18 22:18:39 the context in my question was that 'what free to play mobile game hasn't succumbed to the microtransaction scheme that most free to play mobile games have today'
general 2021-01-18 22:18:56 i am

plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:34:51 as we all know the F-15 was developed in 1943 and deployed in the pacific theater just in time to combat the new Messerschmitt Ju-229 threat that the russians deployed
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:36:11 no the P-47 Mustard was developed by the germans who were allies of the american commonwealth during ww2

general 2021-01-19 18:08:39 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-01-19 18:08:45 exactly
general 2021-01-19 18:08:48 so master supreme it is
general 2021-01-19 18:09:08 unless he gets involved in an 'unfortunate accident'
general 2021-01-19 18:09:10 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

general 2021-01-19 18:10:25 and ask for hof
general 2021-01-19 18:10:28 to staff

general 2021-01-19 18:11:16 a woman made that

general 2021-01-19 18:14:29 you can get 200 upvotes with a motorlocked circle
general 2021-01-19 18:14:44 make my suggestion then
general 2021-01-19 18:14:51 contest participant rank
general 2021-01-19 18:14:54 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-01-19 18:15:01 basically temporary contest blacklist
general 2021-01-19 18:15:14 ok
general 2021-01-19 18:15:17 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-01-19 18:15:47 give all contest participants the rank so they cant see <#674101680891101196> and therefore can't vote
general 2021-01-19 18:15:58 so they can only get information about the contest through other people
general 2021-01-19 18:16:46 im in engineering class rn and we talking about externships <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-02-02 07:05:16 you only need 0.9 block cause the blocks on the turret would weld to the turret ring when spawned in
general 2021-02-02 07:05:22 if you motor lock the turret to the turret ring
general 2021-02-02 07:05:28 0.9 not required

plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:34:32 not saying you were using them
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:34:42 use pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:34:58 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:35:21 what
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:20 do you not have them
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:24 they are from summer event
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:31 if you dont have them then use helium and ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:39 put weight on the bottom, helium on top
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:46 so ship wants to stay upright
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:41:47 most of the time
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:43:35 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:28 wheels are a bit close
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:47 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:02 either way
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:04 pontoons are the best
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:48 at most they take up 2 blocks of vertical space but i can understand
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:02 though i mean i dont see a reason as to why you would want space underneath the waterline
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:06 since you cant exactly walk there
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:17 no you can use 1x1 pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:22 the biggest ones are 3x3x3
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:50 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:03 what if you just motor locked tons of pontoons into a single horizontal line in the hull
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:26 not saying its a good solution but its ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:39 dont see why you would want space below the deck
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:43 unless you want more space for engines etc
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:00:57 in which case you could use 1x1 pontoons but that would increase lag and part count\
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:01:16 what is monsieur lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:01:38 le lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:01:56 would need space outside
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:02:38 there are a lot of designs of ships where that wouldnt exactly be possible
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:03:59 very old ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:05:10 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:06:30 turret isnt actually too high though
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:07:58 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:08:44 still looks comparably nice against contemporary ships
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:09:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:10:01 gjkshrtldb
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:10:01 2x2 barrels
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:10:58 angular yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:11:08 have you started on any other ships
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:11:46 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:11:52 wheels are still too close together
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:11:56 makes them look gigantic
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:13:34 sverige
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:14:21 slightly
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:14:46 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:14:54 compared to a mustang
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:15:16 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:15:23 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:16:13 maybe extend forwards a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:16:39 cause from the front it'll probably just be flat
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:16:46 a little more
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:16:57 double this distance
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:17:11 yes
general 2021-02-07 04:17:46 wow imagine not going for 14 hours
general 2021-02-07 04:17:56 not even 20
general 2021-02-07 04:18:03 not even 40 hours a day
general 2021-02-07 04:18:18 i play at least 500 hours a weekend
general 2021-02-07 04:18:42 no its because taren talked to him
general 2021-02-07 04:18:45 at all
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:26:55 it ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 04:29:48 looks like the wrinkles on your grandmother's face

general 2021-02-07 05:00:02 mayhem
general 2021-02-07 05:01:31 cant exactly be considered your own build if you used a tutorial and repainted it
general 2021-02-07 05:02:25 probably not the best way to convince a new player to stop using tutorials but ok
general 2021-02-07 05:03:11 well some people dont have 500 hours to sink into a lego building game
general 2021-02-07 05:03:20 so they use tutorials to start off strong
general 2021-02-07 05:03:41 but most people only use tutorials to artificially inflate their own perceived skill
general 2021-02-07 05:04:06 
general 2021-02-07 05:04:10 me when
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 05:05:38 <@!221496030355521536> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/635183410083528714
general 2021-02-07 05:05:59 it means there you own 20231 mechanisms
general 2021-02-07 05:06:15 sounded like a yes to me
general 2021-02-07 05:06:30 im pretty sure you typed the word 'yes'
general 2021-02-07 05:06:34 so im right 😎
general 2021-02-07 05:06:52 <@!749835829039464549> ok so you have 20231 mechanics stuck in your basement
general 2021-02-07 05:07:06 or you are a 20231 year old mechanic

general 2021-02-07 05:09:01 chaos
general 2021-02-07 05:09:08 
general 2021-02-07 05:09:41 it didnt exist yet
general 2021-02-07 05:09:49 but yes i did
general 2021-02-07 05:09:52 i understood regular
general 2021-02-07 05:09:54 aeronautics
general 2021-02-07 05:10:03 yes
general 2021-02-07 05:10:07 tutorials didnt exist back then
general 2021-02-07 05:10:09 for all of us
general 2021-02-07 05:10:22 only reason why tutorials are hated is because of a single youtube video
general 2021-02-07 05:10:28 the video was so awful we all agreed it was bad
general 2021-02-07 05:10:38 so thats why tutorials are hated
general 2021-02-07 05:11:02 motor lock isnt needed for quality builds but it is sometimes used to compensate for lack of quality
general 2021-02-07 05:11:37 depends on when they joined
general 2021-02-07 05:11:48 back when i started the game was basically minecraft with wings and engines
general 2021-02-07 05:11:56 i made a plane
general 2021-02-07 05:11:59 and a car
general 2021-02-07 05:12:07 i made stuff
general 2021-02-07 05:12:33 analog joystick that controls roll and pitch of an aircraft's control surfaces and elevators
general 2021-02-07 05:12:47 also a folding submarine
general 2021-02-07 05:12:56 ok
general 2021-02-07 05:13:06 so its an invention
general 2021-02-07 05:13:18 i made the submarine when the ocean was added
general 2021-02-07 05:13:21 there wasnt any deep water back then
general 2021-02-07 05:13:36 i probably met them
general 2021-02-07 05:13:37 idk
general 2021-02-07 05:13:41 guy made a folding 747
general 2021-02-07 05:13:51 i asked if i could copy and he said yes <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-02-07 05:14:08 if there was a roblox admin yes but thats not much compared to what others have done
general 2021-02-07 05:14:09 no
general 2021-02-07 05:14:21 you do realize triangle wedge blocks didnt exist 3 years ago right
general 2021-02-07 05:14:29 ok
general 2021-02-07 05:14:34 neither did 1x3 and 1x4 wedges
general 2021-02-07 05:14:38 also rocket engines
general 2021-02-07 05:14:42 we only have propellor engines and jet engines
general 2021-02-07 05:14:45 they were all extremely weak
general 2021-02-07 05:15:02 game existed since 2015
general 2021-02-07 05:15:06 technically 2014
general 2021-02-07 05:15:13 but i think it was only really developed in 2015
general 2021-02-07 05:15:15 and 2016
general 2021-02-07 05:15:17 ok
general 2021-02-07 05:15:36 used to be lucky to find more than 2 people playing the game at once
general 2021-02-07 05:15:45 game was almost always empty
general 2021-02-07 05:15:49 something
general 2021-02-07 05:16:22 what
general 2021-02-07 05:16:27 when did i mention hover thrusters
general 2021-02-07 05:16:40 https://gyazo.com/901beade1f798bffe5af47e48392b60a
general 2021-02-07 05:16:52 its overcomplicated
general 2021-02-07 05:17:03 wow original idea
general 2021-02-07 05:17:16 its in the middle of the main wings
general 2021-02-07 05:17:43 cylinder
general 2021-02-07 05:18:06 yeah thats simple
general 2021-02-07 05:18:35 unpowered motors
general 2021-02-07 05:18:52 either way you'll need motors
general 2021-02-07 05:19:15 you dont need it
general 2021-02-07 05:19:21 they could be useful but it's not needed
general 2021-02-07 05:19:32 makes pushing the joystick easier
general 2021-02-07 05:19:47 im not going to anyone's youtube channel
general 2021-02-07 05:19:56 i know what hover thrusters do
general 2021-02-07 05:20:05 its extremely simple
general 2021-02-07 05:20:22 just saying you dont need them, but you would want them if you want to make pushing a joystick easier
general 2021-02-07 05:20:46 it would be harder to move the joystick with the character without hover thrusters
general 2021-02-07 05:20:51 but still possible
general 2021-02-07 05:21:02 yeah of course you can
general 2021-02-07 05:21:20 it is possible just hard
general 2021-02-07 05:21:34 whatever you say
general 2021-02-07 05:23:01 cause he brags about having expert supreme even though he only met the basic requirements
general 2021-02-07 05:23:53 
general 2021-02-07 05:31:37 vertical take off and landing
general 2021-02-07 05:31:42 simple term
general 2021-02-07 05:31:48 guess what abdication means
general 2021-02-07 05:32:21 armor piercing high explosive fin discarding sabot and i forgot ds
general 2021-02-07 05:32:38 wait its fin stabilized discarding sabot
general 2021-02-07 05:33:02 i remember the first 20 digits of pi
general 2021-02-07 05:33:05 its not that much
general 2021-02-07 05:33:07 but i still remember
general 2021-02-07 05:33:18 though at this point the numbers get mixed up
general 2021-02-07 05:33:29 3.141592653589793238
general 2021-02-07 05:34:03 well it was originally about planes
general 2021-02-07 05:34:08 only wing panel and engines
general 2021-02-07 05:34:09 and block
general 2021-02-07 05:34:12 nothing else
general 2021-02-07 05:34:22 moma
general 2021-02-07 05:36:59 yeah im pretty sure its just the same guy
general 2021-02-07 05:37:02 doing the same thing
general 2021-02-07 05:37:03 everyday
general 2021-02-07 05:37:08 multiple people reported this
general 2021-02-07 05:37:19 rickje said he fixed it but people are still saying its happening
general 2021-02-07 05:38:15 impossible
general 2021-02-07 05:38:29 probably not
general 2021-02-07 05:38:38 either way its still an issue
general 2021-02-07 05:40:01 true
general 2021-02-07 05:40:53 probably verification numbers
general 2021-02-07 05:47:12 <@!536803160707170310> he only has the build copying exploit he's not an actual hacker so dont worry
general 2021-02-07 05:47:17 just a script kiddie
general 2021-02-07 05:48:33 hackers have the knowledge to make their own stuff but they can use premade stuff too
general 2021-02-07 05:48:41 exploiters just use something that exists already but doesnt have the knowledge
general 2021-02-07 05:49:12 hackers and exploiters are similar its just the hackers are more knowledgable
general 2021-02-07 05:49:27 have a terrible summer

general 2021-02-07 09:46:25 yes
general 2021-02-07 09:46:28 he has copied multiple builds
general 2021-02-07 09:46:31 on multiple alts
general 2021-02-07 09:46:37 multiple people have reported it
general 2021-02-07 09:46:55 probably just the same exact guy copying everyone and seeing them freak out
general 2021-02-07 09:47:19 he was in vip 1 today before he got banned
general 2021-02-07 09:47:23 i think he copied miner
general 2021-02-07 09:47:36 too bad miner's builds require multiple creations
general 2021-02-07 09:49:02 we know
general 2021-02-07 09:49:27 issue can only be resolved if rickje fixes it
general 2021-02-07 09:49:32 and he probably wont do anything
general 2021-02-07 09:50:00 or just stay away from plane crazy
general 2021-02-07 09:50:03 and only play alone
general 2021-02-07 09:50:07 in expert vip
general 2021-02-07 09:50:37 just play alone
general 2021-02-07 09:50:44 in expert vip 2
general 2021-02-07 09:51:09 why
general 2021-02-07 09:53:55 he likely has like 5 alts with copied builds on all of them
general 2021-02-07 09:53:57 just report him
general 2021-02-07 09:53:59 or mass report him
general 2021-02-07 09:54:11 roblox
general 2021-02-07 09:54:26 buy bot creation service from some indians and get 2000 bots to report him

creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:49:35 well you've improved a lot but as for the ship it appears either too long or too narrow for a sloop of war
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:51:35 either way it would look a bit wrong being that thin/long, it'd be worth it to shorten the ship if i were you
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:53:39 j
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:57:56 yeah not saying the hull is bad, just too long, and otherwise it should turn out fine
using a bit more effort in the basic stages of development is easier than having to fix any mistakes at the very end 
though actually you might be able to shorten it using a long line of motor lock

general 2021-02-11 20:28:18 definitely more than enough
general 2021-02-11 20:28:34 most challenging part is actually placing all the blocks

general 2021-02-17 09:01:03 amine
general 2021-02-18 03:30:17 euro
general 2021-02-18 03:31:23 around 2.0
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:32:32 how about just not making a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:33:01 if someone subscribes to your channel solely so they can use stuff you make to claim as their own then they're not really someone who watches you for your videos
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:33:29 they'd be leeches instead of real subscribers
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:34:07 if you say you'll never make any tutorials then it'll reduce the people trying to leech off of your own work
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:34:33 and the amount of people begging for tutorials will eventually dwindle
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:34:59 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:35:06 depends on size
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:35:20 yeah should be easy
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:35:28 just need motor lock or camera lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:35:52 well
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:35:54 first of all
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:05 make sure the camera is only attached to what you want to be camera locked
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:15 and make sure the camera isnt attached to the main body of your creation
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:26 so the only thing that is welded to it is the thing you want to rotate
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:44 and then use purple screwdriver to point the camera at any block
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:51 remove the block you aimed at if you want to
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:36:53 and then spawn in
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:37:04 the camera and the blocks welded to it will rotate
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:37:16 its confusing and you cant use folds with it so not really
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:37:41 cause cameras instantly weld to the main pilot seat when they are aimed at a block
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:37:58 they weld to the main pilot seat when rotated even when they arent touching something that is welded to it
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:38:31 so you cant really use it on piece of a build that has to be folded
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:38:42 though you can use camera lock to make an instant fold
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:40:44 yes but the propellor wont be able to spin
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:41:15 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 03:41:41 more useful for smaller builds

general 2021-02-18 04:06:11 same applies for t-34
general 2021-02-18 04:06:42 when you play as a t-34 against germans its like playing duck hunt but with movement controls
general 2021-02-18 04:06:59 unless the t-34 in question is a t-34-85
general 2021-02-18 04:07:07 and then you face unepic german tanks
general 2021-02-18 04:07:45 pz ivs are easy to kill but the moment they stop rushing in and use brain they are epic
general 2021-02-18 04:07:55 ULQ <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-02-18 04:08:20 honestly its kinda hard to be bad at playing in a t-34 non-85mm
general 2021-02-18 04:08:42 then you are just
general 2021-02-18 04:08:43 dumb as shit
general 2021-02-18 04:08:44 😎
general 2021-02-18 04:08:58 zis-5 specifically
general 2021-02-18 04:09:24 everything under 5.0 russian is easy game
general 2021-02-18 04:09:43 is-1 is pain and suffering
general 2021-02-18 04:09:52 nothing really
general 2021-02-18 04:09:55 engine is cool
general 2021-02-18 04:09:58 but gun matters most
general 2021-02-18 04:10:01 on spg
general 2021-02-18 04:10:03 yes
general 2021-02-18 04:10:10 i had to play with it for months
general 2021-02-18 04:10:14 cause i didnt care to grind in it
general 2021-02-18 04:10:48 i dont even have the is-2 yet
general 2021-02-18 04:10:56 cause i just play lower tiers instead of grinding in is-1
general 2021-02-18 04:11:14 cool
general 2021-02-18 04:11:22 yes
general 2021-02-18 04:11:24 getting it is easy
general 2021-02-18 04:11:27 is not
general 2021-02-18 04:11:27 but using it
general 2021-02-18 04:12:30 cause tech tree
general 2021-02-18 04:12:42 cant just play tier iv all the time
general 2021-02-18 04:12:51 gets boring playing with people half your iq
general 2021-02-18 04:13:25 why
general 2021-02-18 04:13:26 thats like
general 2021-02-18 04:13:28 the worst
general 2021-02-18 04:13:29 honestly
general 2021-02-18 04:13:31 it gets uptiered the most
general 2021-02-18 04:13:38 are you a masochist
general 2021-02-18 04:13:52 dont do that to yourself
general 2021-02-18 04:14:02 i mean stay at tier 6 when playing arty yes
general 2021-02-18 04:14:07 but not anything else
general 2021-02-18 04:14:08 also
general 2021-02-18 04:14:16 you definitely want the T29
general 2021-02-18 04:14:21 its epic tank
general 2021-02-18 04:14:31 tho the T1 and M6 are bad
general 2021-02-18 04:14:45 its a good thing you used to be able to get the T29 from the sherman jumbo <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-02-18 04:14:49 so i got it for free
general 2021-02-18 04:14:57 exp wise
general 2021-02-18 04:15:19 tho yes the swedish tds are good
general 2021-02-18 04:15:30 but i wont have advice for you when you do go for it
general 2021-02-18 04:15:45 yes
general 2021-02-18 04:15:52 also japanese heavies are troll tank
general 2021-02-18 04:16:01 giant tank and giant armor and giant gun
general 2021-02-18 04:16:21 yes
general 2021-02-18 04:16:24 but still
general 2021-02-18 04:16:27 relatively good armor
general 2021-02-18 04:16:29 so not much damage
general 2021-02-18 04:17:09 the j is j
general 2021-02-18 04:17:18 tho
general 2021-02-18 04:17:27 have you not gone down russian tech tree yet
general 2021-02-18 04:17:42 dont completely ignore russian tree
general 2021-02-18 04:17:47 its pretty much the most average
general 2021-02-18 04:17:49 which is good
general 2021-02-18 04:17:59 cause all nations have some different quirks
general 2021-02-18 04:18:03 frenchies have no armor
general 2021-02-18 04:18:06 unless duck

plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:19:56 new map has a 80% chance of never being released btw
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:20:22 showcases are to show off the build
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:20:49 to show off the build
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:04 thats like asking what the purpose of plane crazy is
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:09 or what the purpose of anything is
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:13 cause you'll die in the end
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:16 so it wont matter
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:19 no its not
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:23 it just has the brand logo on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:25 and nothing else
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:42 the only relation to innovation inc that plane crazy has is that madattak decided to slap the innovation inc logo onto the game
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:21:56 it was never created as an innovation inc game
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:16 it didnt even have the innovation inc logo until 2019
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:28 and the game was made in 2014
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:30 who is martin
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:41 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:45 im lockheed before it was combined
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:22:56 martin killed it
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:23:08 lockheed martin was only created in the 2000s
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:23:20 lockheed itself existed for years without the 'martin'
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:23:57 showcases are to show off
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:06 no but your pfp is
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:08 😎
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:17 true
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:32 there have already been tutorials about motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:40 so why would you want that other guy to make a tutorial on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:24:45 cause all it uses is motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:25:13 dude if someone finds an innovative method of making good builds then other people would copy them either way
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:25:17 and it will spread
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:25:28 we just dont like using tutorials in general
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:25:31 other than the basic ones
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:26:14 and the main form of tutorial that is hated is just the tutorial where someone builds an entire creation for anyone to copy and show off as their own
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:27:00 there is an easy way to avoid shredders
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 04:27:03 just don't play pvp

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:21 so what
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:26 they were added in 2019
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:33 and you think people could travel back in time
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:35 to use them
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:38 to get inventor in 2018
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:48 ok cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:14 so what
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:20 make one then
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:31 cause you want to
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:44 if you dont want to then why do you mention it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:35:05 true
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:35:50 you are unranked
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:01 and you act like you know how to get inventor rank when you dont even have it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:04 therefore
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:06 the statement is true
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:44 its a figure of speech
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:37:08 its not yours to decide how other people think you act
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:37:40 then get inventor lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:37:44 if its stupid
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:20 thats like saying its stupid that it was easier for the first few presidents to be elected cause they needed less votes to win
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:29 its possible just harder
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:37 a lot of the special stuff has already been made
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:42 just make something very complex
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:45 like mechanical logic gates
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:48 to make a 2 bit computer
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:55 4 bit if you're dedicated enough
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:39:26 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:39:57 so he thinks its stupid that some people got inventor 'too easily' even though it was a new rank at the time and wasnt that prestigious
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:40:18 cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:40:26 like 20000 people have made that already

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:40:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:41:06 i know a few people who have
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:41:18 maybe not 20000 since it was an exaggeration but still more than just yourself
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:43:21 probably quite a few
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:43:24 literally just motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:44:03 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/784212804902060082
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:44:56 it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:07 its just a few stacks of motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:20 i mean im not trying to gatekeep here
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:24 but if you are asking
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:26 then not really
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:33 not hard i mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:45 there are a bunch of tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:46 except
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:54 most people never learn anything more than those tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:55 like
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:59 they just give you some templates
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:46:12 and then most people think that that's the only way to use motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:46:17 and they never experiment
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:46:21 and learn newer methods
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:46:40 so most people think of motor lock as a couple of stacks of motor lock to add some more engines into their planes

general 2021-02-25 22:24:36 the title doesnt determine effort
general 2021-02-25 22:24:53 its just usually they build a block and say 'i put effort' therefore obviously low effort
general 2021-02-25 22:25:03 but the build itself isnt low enough effort

general 2021-02-25 22:31:35 on fish tank server theres an entire channel dedicated to drawing nsfw art of a female version of the server owner
general 2021-02-25 22:31:46 id say that would give it a worse reputation than pcc
general 2021-02-25 22:32:16 that isnt related to reputation
general 2021-02-25 22:32:45 reputation is the opinion that other people have based on what you do
general 2021-02-25 22:32:59 anyone can do whatever they want but depending on what they do they will have a different reputation

general 2021-02-25 22:34:58 at least we dont have an entire channel dedicated to nsfw art

general 2021-02-27 05:52:22 the amount you pay for bobux can vary
general 2021-02-27 05:52:31 so it shouldnt be judged by the most amount of money you pay for it
general 2021-02-27 05:52:33 but instead the least
general 2021-02-27 05:52:41 so its more like 1/10 of a cent per robuck instead of 1 cent

general 2021-02-27 06:06:12 it would be disappointing
general 2021-02-27 06:06:19 yes
general 2021-02-27 06:06:23 40k on rewrite is reasonable
general 2021-02-27 06:06:28 you already got a lot from donations
general 2021-02-27 06:06:45 its reasonable for a game that people like
general 2021-02-27 06:07:05 i think the thousands of players who play the game would say that's worth it
general 2021-02-27 06:07:20 id say there are at least 50k players that play plane crazy regularly
general 2021-02-27 06:07:25 so that's like less than 1 robux per player

plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:00:47 and so you can use player parachute while sat down

plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:02:36 only parts of the seat that weld are the back and the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 17:02:53 so just make sure those parts of the seat arent touched by anything that isnt the spring

general 2021-03-07 11:11:38 it would run at 2 fps
general 2021-03-07 11:11:40 at best
general 2021-03-07 11:11:58 also im pretty sure roblox can only run as an executable
general 2021-03-07 11:12:15 it cant run using any other type of file
general 2021-03-07 11:12:24 maybe different for mobile

general 2021-03-08 16:19:13 i said that
general 2021-03-08 16:19:32 you dont google things you dont know?
general 2021-03-08 16:19:41 it was clearly important enough for you to ask the question
general 2021-03-08 16:19:48 to other people
general 2021-03-08 16:19:57 so why do you ask real people questions
general 2021-03-08 16:20:02 instead of google

general 2021-03-08 16:22:16 you dont google things?
general 2021-03-08 16:22:29 i mean there's lazy and then there's purposefully lazy
general 2021-03-08 16:22:45 you're using more effort to be lazy
general 2021-03-08 16:22:51 than just being regularly lazy

general 2021-03-08 16:40:02 being inside generally will make your eyes more near sighted over time

general 2021-03-08 16:40:36 at most itll be maybe a few meters away
general 2021-03-08 16:40:41 your eyesight will still adjust

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:18:56 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:10 is that a reduction of half a block or 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:25 is it possible to reduce by only half a block
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:31 probably not
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:33 due to the front
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:35 well
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:40 looks better when reduced height
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:43 than tall
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:19:57 looks almost like an m60 due to large turret size
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:22:14 the colors make it feel like a fantasy ship and the sun in the middle of the picture makes it hard to see the actual ship
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:22:24 the color on the ship ingame i mean
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:23:09 additionally a lot of the parts of the ship seem to be oversized
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:23:19 the funnels seem to be too wide
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:23:26 makes the ship look like a cartoon drawing
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:23:37 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:23:48 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:24:00 ok
the-dump 2021-03-08 21:29:21 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:31:46 it doesnt look big enough to have over 10k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:32:52 my pre dreadnought cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:33:27 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:33:37 im not saying it isnt
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:33:49 im just saying thats a lot of blocks for a very small creation
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:34:03 either you have a very compact ship or you didn't use beams
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:02 i can show you one of my ships that is close to 10k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:13 how long is the ship
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:14 btw
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:35:45 so 125
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:03 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:17 
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:32 thats
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:33 not my point
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:36:46 my ship is barely 10k blocks but it's bigger in most respects other than the interior
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:37:06 not saying you're doing anything wrong
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:37:26 ive just seen most people have small builds but have large block counts that don't seem to be attributed to anything
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:38:04 not an argument
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:38:10 when was it ever an argument
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:38:19 i dont remember an argument ever occurring
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:38:26 i dont remember a debate ever occurring

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:38:56 that anchor is gigantic as well
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 21:39:20 the ship is just cartoonishly proportioned in general

general 2021-03-09 02:47:51 you're going to get executed by a dictator
general 2021-03-09 02:48:31 there is an entire company named vulture that produces rc helicopters i think
general 2021-03-09 02:48:43 idk
general 2021-03-09 02:48:43 ah wait no thats a newspaper
general 2021-03-09 02:48:58 but google does autofill -copter when i type in vulture heli
general 2021-03-09 02:49:00 so idk

general 2021-03-09 02:50:34 the j
general 2021-03-09 02:50:37 the t
general 2021-03-09 02:50:52 no that just makes it easier to avoid your creation lol
general 2021-03-09 02:51:09 its ok
general 2021-03-09 02:51:37 depends on how good the other creation is
general 2021-03-09 02:51:56 bidness
general 2021-03-09 02:52:19 so wait 20 days?
general 2021-03-09 02:52:21 or like
general 2021-03-09 02:52:24 2 months
general 2021-03-09 02:52:31 not really
general 2021-03-09 02:53:26 also if they're good builders in your opinion then wouldnt that mean that vilde's heli would be voted less due to people going 'this guy is much better' and thus deserves their upvote instead
general 2021-03-09 02:53:47 not saying hersriirsrion or razaravza are good
general 2021-03-09 02:53:53 not everyone thinks that way
general 2021-03-09 02:54:10 people arent predictable
general 2021-03-09 02:54:18 i mean if you run experiments then they are predictable
general 2021-03-09 02:54:23 but if we have no idea how they'll react
general 2021-03-09 02:54:26 they are very unpredictable
general 2021-03-09 02:54:33 so just post when you think is right
general 2021-03-09 02:55:13 if you post when a very good creation was recently created, either more people will upvote it, or more people will see it and then choose not to upvote it
general 2021-03-09 02:55:22 but we dont know beforehand
general 2021-03-09 02:55:38 also if we made a poll and put it in <#490306593242611742> we could find out who lives where in pcc
general 2021-03-09 02:55:43 and therefore we can find out best times to post
general 2021-03-09 02:55:45 due to time zones
general 2021-03-09 02:55:58 so dont wait then
general 2021-03-09 02:56:06 i know but it can change
general 2021-03-09 02:56:20 generally 1/3-1/2 of english speaking internet is american
general 2021-03-09 02:56:30 so not worth the wait then
general 2021-03-09 02:56:47 would you wait a month to get 10 more upvotes
general 2021-03-09 02:56:52 thats 1/3 of an upvote per day
general 2021-03-09 02:57:03 i wouldnt wait
general 2021-03-09 02:57:10 cause upvotes arent worth that much
general 2021-03-09 02:57:14 its not reddit
general 2021-03-09 02:57:20 tho they dont matter on reddit either
general 2021-03-09 02:57:37 wrong number

general 2021-03-09 16:28:04 other games are understandable
general 2021-03-09 16:28:10 but roblox doesnt need to be fullscreen

general 2021-03-09 16:29:15 ok lol
general 2021-03-09 16:29:17 i dont care
general 2021-03-09 16:29:35 i wont get 50 more kills just by enabling fullscreen

general 2021-03-09 17:35:02 thats a mask
general 2021-03-09 17:35:39 if a mask is the same thing as a bag
general 2021-03-09 17:35:48 then a hat is the same thing as a bowl
general 2021-03-09 17:36:08 eat using hat
general 2021-03-09 17:36:26 2 million dollar car is same thing as 200 dollar used camry
general 2021-03-09 17:38:35 nsx gen 2 looks nice ingame
general 2021-03-09 17:38:38 in my opinion

general 2021-03-09 17:41:40 ok

general 2021-03-13 10:38:49 yes
general 2021-03-13 10:41:30 or just play video games
general 2021-03-13 10:41:56 complex interactions that get rewarded as well as actually enjoying the experience
general 2021-03-13 10:42:36 not all video games obviously but games that dont even involve puzzles usually involve complex interactions that your brain has to figure out in some way
general 2021-03-13 10:43:01 you already posted these
general 2021-03-13 10:43:13 some time ago
general 2021-03-13 10:43:34 well strategy is a part of it
general 2021-03-13 10:43:37 i mean
general 2021-03-13 10:43:52 if you're not good at an fps then yeah you wont be using as much of your brain
general 2021-03-13 10:44:12 yeah but its very similar and i dont see anyone who would be interested in seeing these
general 2021-03-13 10:45:46 someone who enjoys cyberbullying weebs
general 2021-03-13 10:45:52 which i can appreciate
general 2021-03-13 10:46:13 usually finding solutions to any problem just involve creativity
general 2021-03-13 10:46:35 a math problem isnt much different from any other problem other than how it's handled
general 2021-03-13 10:46:51 and it depends on how much knowledge you already have on the subject
general 2021-03-13 10:47:50 under 13 people probably wont be able to use their mics
general 2021-03-13 10:48:22 who
general 2021-03-13 10:48:34 another weeb im guessing
general 2021-03-13 10:48:35 cool
general 2021-03-13 10:49:07 how did sleeping strengthen your ai's memory
general 2021-03-13 10:49:11 ok so
general 2021-03-13 10:49:31 im not roblox
general 2021-03-13 10:49:34 i dont care
general 2021-03-13 10:50:22 thats not very close to sleeping then
general 2021-03-13 10:50:29 kinda more like
general 2021-03-13 10:50:31 meditating
general 2021-03-13 10:50:41 or sitting on the toilet
general 2021-03-13 10:50:46 without a phone
general 2021-03-13 10:51:11 ok
general 2021-03-13 10:51:38 not really
general 2021-03-13 10:51:42 i experience dreams
general 2021-03-13 10:51:50 do you experience memories
general 2021-03-13 10:51:56 when you sleep
general 2021-03-13 10:51:59 cause that is strange
general 2021-03-13 10:52:10 dreams are created from memories yes
general 2021-03-13 10:52:18 but they are completely new
general 2021-03-13 10:52:22 formed by your brain
general 2021-03-13 10:52:43 i still wouldnt consider it sleeping
general 2021-03-13 10:53:12 sleeping also involves the process of your body resting physically and of it repairing itself
general 2021-03-13 10:53:41 then you can also call it meditating
general 2021-03-13 10:53:49 because the spider is still awake
general 2021-03-13 10:53:51 its state hasnt changed
general 2021-03-13 10:54:00 just has its exterior senses temporarily disabled
general 2021-03-13 10:55:10 well when you sleep you dont experience your memories and improve the strength of those memories
general 2021-03-13 10:55:27 you experience new dreams formed by old memories but you don't experience those old memories directly
general 2021-03-13 10:55:34 so your bond between the old memories does not change
general 2021-03-13 10:55:46 however your brain creates new situations out of the information from those memories
general 2021-03-13 10:56:02 it just doesn't really strengthen the bond between itself and the old memories
general 2021-03-13 10:56:14 it's just flexing its creativity pretty much
general 2021-03-13 10:57:19 yes those memories need to be activated but very little of those memories are actually experienced within the dreams
general 2021-03-13 10:57:52 your brain might use information from a memory to create a dream but the moment you wake up you only recall information from the dream that memory created instead of the memory itself
general 2021-03-13 10:58:52 so they activate at random then
general 2021-03-13 10:59:04 why not activate memories that will improve its chances of survival
general 2021-03-13 10:59:32 well it cant activate every single memory it experienced while it was awake
general 2021-03-13 10:59:54 unless its memories are not experienced that often
general 2021-03-13 11:01:13 ok you're speaking abstractly
general 2021-03-13 11:01:26 i feel like you're putting 10x more depth into your ai than it actually has
general 2021-03-13 11:01:47 you call shutting off its external sensors 'sleeping'
general 2021-03-13 11:02:10 and you call its inner memories intertwining as 'dreaming' even though dreaming is still much more complex
general 2021-03-13 11:02:38 i would call it meditating
general 2021-03-13 11:03:16 if you fall asleep or get extremely bored yes
general 2021-03-13 11:03:49 but meditating is pretty much sleep without the body needing to do as much as it does while sleeping
general 2021-03-13 11:03:57 so i would say it fits meditation slightly better
general 2021-03-13 11:04:34 of course it stops moving
general 2021-03-13 11:04:39 that was one of my first assumptions
general 2021-03-13 11:04:54 you shouldn't shut off your external senses and then continue moving
general 2021-03-13 11:05:05 helen keller spider
general 2021-03-13 11:06:26 all that but unconscious

general 2021-03-15 16:52:30 gun is what makes pz 4 good
general 2021-03-15 16:53:15 moment moment moment
general 2021-03-15 16:53:27 impossible
general 2021-03-15 16:53:35 is-1 and is-2 have kinda weak armor
general 2021-03-15 16:53:46 of course
general 2021-03-15 16:53:50 but if an is-3 player tries angling
general 2021-03-15 16:53:52 they are dead
general 2021-03-15 16:53:59 if an is-3 player tries to not angle
general 2021-03-15 16:54:01 shoot lower plate
general 2021-03-15 16:54:05 basically
general 2021-03-15 16:54:07 at any angle
general 2021-03-15 16:54:10 an is-3 has a flat side
general 2021-03-15 16:54:27 just make sure not to shoot the sides unless its below the tracks
general 2021-03-15 16:54:30 cause

general 2021-03-15 16:58:37 that have health
general 2021-03-15 16:58:46 its the armor and armor piercing mechanics

general 2021-03-15 16:59:46 thats just enlisted
general 2021-03-15 16:59:51 thats why enlisted exists in the first place
general 2021-03-15 16:59:59 they dont want to implement into wt
general 2021-03-15 17:00:05 enlisted exists because it wont be added into wt

general 2021-03-15 17:07:40 still a real moment
general 2021-03-15 17:07:47 should be armor plates on there
general 2021-03-15 17:07:52 instead of being completely flat
general 2021-03-15 17:08:04 but prob not experienced with motor lock so idk if you can add it

general 2021-03-15 23:59:22 send that to expired
general 2021-03-15 23:59:24 not pcc
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:03:35 cause he didnt request it
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:03:38 and hof minimum is 100 votes
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:04:01 if its barely above the minimum requirements it is very very unlikely it will ever get in
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:04:32 only ones that are either way above the minimum or are above the minimum and rising fast would really ever win the vote
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:04:47 its grey
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:05:02 he just didnt put any texturing on it
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:05:07 his pfp is white
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:05:12 you can clearly tell the difference
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:05:23 light grey against black looks white
general 2021-03-16 00:07:32 he will not be welcomed
general 2021-03-16 00:07:39 7 hours late

general 2021-03-16 00:07:52 yesterday/today
general 2021-03-16 00:08:05 technically he was mod half a year ago
general 2021-03-16 00:08:08 so that was when
general 2021-03-16 00:08:36 72 not much nowadays
general 2021-03-16 00:09:02 100 is the amount of votes where a build would be considered pretty nice
general 2021-03-16 00:09:17 a jetpack
general 2021-03-16 00:09:23 idk if the offer is still up tho
general 2021-03-16 00:09:25 dm rickje
general 2021-03-16 00:09:41 you wont get warned for dming him uselessly since he cares about server boosts
general 2021-03-16 00:10:05 not for boosting
general 2021-03-16 00:10:19 always has been
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:14:01 
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:14:34 all are textured
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:14:43 unless you choose to untexture it
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:14:50 plus he was clearly going for that look either way
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:15:13 he wasnt making the personal variant either way so ok cool
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:15:31 cause he isnt miner
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:15:48 also
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:15:49 like i said
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:15:56 its clearly supposed to be the digital variant
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:16:00 because of the nose
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:16:17 and both greys match the digital camo greys
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:16:43 if you color the hydra differently the grey doesnt stay grey
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:16:48 it becomes a darker version of the main color
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:17:17 if you google 'gta v hydra' you're going to get the variant with digital camo
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:17:24 thats just the more likely option
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:17:32 why argue for something that is less likely
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:18:49 a smaller chance
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:10 your original point was that the hydra in gta v has no texture at all
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:15 which is wrong
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:30 the most common version of the hydra that you see is the one with the texture/camo
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:37 so your original point was wrong
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:47 the message you replied to me with contained your point
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:19:54 you added on information afterwards
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 00:20:00 but your first point was directly wrong

general 2021-03-16 00:39:36 wow yeah 4 blocks and the same plane = copy
general 2021-03-16 00:39:45 you probably copied mine anyways 😎
general 2021-03-16 00:40:23 the tutorial itself was made in jan of 2019 and the build was made in 2018
general 2021-03-16 00:40:51 how could you possibly accuse me of copying you when i literally only made it on community vip server 1 of this discord server
general 2021-03-16 00:41:06 you probably saw someone with a similar nose that copied from my tutorial and then use that nose
general 2021-03-16 00:41:16 or maybe it's possible that original ideas can be similar
general 2021-03-16 00:41:49 yes

general 2021-03-21 04:17:54 do you not remember data updates
general 2021-03-21 04:18:11 would be laggier than roblox adding it back in
general 2021-03-21 04:18:19 it would require outlines for every single part
general 2021-03-21 04:18:51 ok how is that related to roblox exactly
general 2021-03-21 04:19:00 minecraft uses java
general 2021-03-21 04:19:02 roblox uses lua
general 2021-03-21 04:19:06 on a base level
general 2021-03-21 04:19:10 both games are completely different
general 2021-03-21 04:19:28 minecraft bedrock doesnt use java but only insane people play bedrock
general 2021-03-21 04:20:09 thats probably gonna add random outlines everywhere
general 2021-03-21 04:20:16 yes
general 2021-03-21 04:20:34 i know
general 2021-03-21 04:21:07 ok so instead of having random outlines everywhere there'll be outlines on 10% of blocks
general 2021-03-21 04:21:41 either you deal with outlines in places where there shouldnt be outlines or you deal with having very few outlines
general 2021-03-21 04:21:45 people with ocd will die
general 2021-03-21 04:21:59 it doesnt matter cause its not gonna happen

general 2021-03-21 04:22:07 or are ever going to

general 2021-03-22 21:06:57 noob country
general 2021-03-22 21:07:00 cant even win a war
general 2021-03-22 21:07:30 they were strong because they lost the 2 biggest wars in human history
general 2021-03-22 21:07:34 yes very strong
general 2021-03-22 21:07:39 amazing strength
general 2021-03-22 21:08:08 so you're saying china is the strongest nation on the planet
general 2021-03-22 21:08:13 currently
general 2021-03-22 21:08:28 ok then how is amount of troops deployed equal to military strength
general 2021-03-22 21:08:55 china has the largest army
general 2021-03-22 21:09:26 your point by saying germany deployed 13 million soldiers during ww1 is that more troops = strength, therefore you're also saying that china = strongest
general 2021-03-22 21:09:44 then dont just say something and never elaborate
general 2021-03-22 21:09:51 until i have to ask you specifically
general 2021-03-22 21:10:13 they still lost both world wars so <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-03-22 21:10:48 they wouldnt have started anything without the mustache man
general 2021-03-22 21:11:35 if the mustache man didnt exist then ww2 wouldnt have happened and germany wouldnt even have gotten a chance to win it
general 2021-03-22 21:12:02 cold war still would have existed
general 2021-03-22 21:12:05 except
general 2021-03-22 21:12:07 without as many nukes
general 2021-03-22 21:12:15 cause wartime research is faster than peacetime
general 2021-03-22 21:12:29 though since they probably would go to war with japan anyways it might be the same outcome

plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:08:45 so what is your point
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:08:49 both are pretty similar
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:08:52 b17s are just more famous

general 2021-03-30 17:09:45 what a surprise
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:10:08 they're both similar
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:10:17 also you can just make a mini b29 and still call it a b29
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:10:28 so size doesnt really matter in this case
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:10:35 people can make it whatever size they want it to be
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:10:46 so a b29 might be easier than a b17 because it is smaller
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 17:11:46 doesnt look weird if you build it right

general 2021-03-30 17:21:23 thats what i said
general 2021-03-30 17:21:45 nobe <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-30 17:21:47 just do it then
general 2021-03-30 17:22:02 he deleted account
general 2021-03-30 17:22:05 almost a year ago
general 2021-03-30 17:23:18 
general 2021-03-30 17:23:31 needs to be super superintelligent for that
general 2021-03-30 17:24:09 well intelligence cant just be defined by a number
general 2021-03-30 17:24:29 yes but not very well
general 2021-03-30 17:24:57 but we can barely simulate and predict weather
general 2021-03-30 17:25:10 its gonna take centuries to create a whole reality on the level of the matrix
general 2021-03-30 17:25:28 but if there's enough money given to a single group of people they could do it pretty quickly
general 2021-03-30 17:25:46 look good enough and act good enough
general 2021-03-30 17:25:48 so basically
general 2021-03-30 17:25:50 just a video game
general 2021-03-30 17:25:53 noob
general 2021-03-30 17:25:59 not a virtual reality
general 2021-03-30 17:26:15 too bad
general 2021-03-30 17:26:18 you said virtual reality
general 2021-03-30 17:26:19 not vr
general 2021-03-30 17:26:23 pretty different
general 2021-03-30 17:26:34 yes i know
general 2021-03-30 17:26:43 but in common use they refer to the type of video game
general 2021-03-30 17:27:09 you stated 'a virtual reality' not 'virtual reality' therefore you separated into the other meaning of the word
general 2021-03-30 17:27:18 yes thats what i said
general 2021-03-30 17:27:21 just needs to be smart enough
general 2021-03-30 17:27:26 but superintelligence wont cut it
general 2021-03-30 17:27:29 super omegaintelligence will
general 2021-03-30 17:27:32 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-30 17:27:44 super omega ultra intelligence
general 2021-03-30 17:27:53 your mom amounts of intelligence
general 2021-03-30 17:28:01 we havent
general 2021-03-30 17:28:14 sure but we havent

general 2021-03-30 17:28:24 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-30 17:28:29 if we could then we would have
general 2021-03-30 17:28:53 so we havent
general 2021-03-30 17:28:54 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-30 17:29:07 so we havent <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-30 17:29:22 humans cant make an actual virtual reality by hand
general 2021-03-30 17:29:24 would take too long
general 2021-03-30 17:29:35 basically we would need to build a supercomputer to do it for us
general 2021-03-30 17:29:46 yes
general 2021-03-30 17:29:48 but not humans
general 2021-03-30 17:29:59 people cant compare to ai
general 2021-03-30 17:30:03 nope
general 2021-03-30 17:30:08 well its possible but not feasible
general 2021-03-30 17:30:17 would be better to build a computer to build one for us
general 2021-03-30 17:30:19 less effort
general 2021-03-30 17:30:45 so we wont ever make a human created virtual reality
general 2021-03-30 17:30:52 unless some redditor does it in the 22nd century
general 2021-03-30 17:31:46 do we tho

general 2021-03-30 17:32:11 i mean its simple enough to say 'ok make game look realistic' but do we
general 2021-03-30 17:32:19 depends on what you consider to be knowledge
general 2021-03-30 17:32:38 exactly
general 2021-03-30 17:32:40 thats too simple
general 2021-03-30 17:32:43 of a description
general 2021-03-30 17:32:49 'ok just simulate atoms bro'
general 2021-03-30 17:33:02 no
general 2021-03-30 17:33:10 i mean we dont actually know how to
general 2021-03-30 17:33:24 if you just say 'ok simulate atoms' that doesnt mean anything in terms of knowledge
general 2021-03-30 17:33:30 ok do it <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-03-30 17:34:06 because you said you could make a new one
general 2021-03-30 17:34:18 yes but i want you to

general 2021-03-30 17:34:56 boom
general 2021-03-30 17:35:01 simulated the entire argument
general 2021-03-30 17:35:08 and your mother
general 2021-03-30 17:36:12 well depends on what decision they want to make
general 2021-03-30 17:36:19 if simulating a reality is easier
general 2021-03-30 17:36:23 why not just do nothing
general 2021-03-30 17:36:28 easiest thing to possibly do
general 2021-03-30 17:36:43 well what if it wants to make paperclips instead
general 2021-03-30 17:36:48 and consume the entire universe
general 2021-03-30 17:36:52 1 paperclip = 1 score

general 2021-03-30 17:38:17 but that technically wont increase its score
general 2021-03-30 17:38:27 depends on what the score is measured by
general 2021-03-30 17:38:38 it might as well just modify itself and make score go into infinity
general 2021-03-30 17:38:43 and then do whatever the hell it wants
general 2021-03-30 17:38:50 cause it's smart enough
general 2021-03-30 17:39:11 exactly
general 2021-03-30 17:39:20 a virtual one might not be the same as a real one
general 2021-03-30 17:39:25 yes
general 2021-03-30 17:39:41 not really

plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:18:49 soon to be 110-125 if people keep trying to submit builds with barely 100 upvotes for voting
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:19:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:19:38 if you only barely achieve the minimum number for hof then its clearly not really that great
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:19:52 cause thats its peak
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:20:12 100 upvotes is kind of the equivalent of 50-60 upvotes in 2019-2020
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:21:14 not really what im saying
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:21:25 if it only reaches 100 upvotes and stays at 100 then thats the max its gonna get
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:21:47 if it gets 100 upvotes in a few hours and is clearly going to go to 150+ then it would definitely get hof easier
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:22:34 builds that only barely meet the minimum and stay there aren't going to do well

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:14:51 whether a wheel is powered or not doesnt really matter
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:15:49 sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 18:15:59 all depends on what kind of wheels and tracks you use

general 2021-04-26 19:44:00 not really
general 2021-04-26 19:44:03 brm is nowhere near
general 2021-04-26 19:44:41 yes you work in storm
general 2021-04-26 20:11:39 not for that warn
general 2021-04-26 20:11:51 you posted a suspicious file
general 2021-04-26 20:11:58 you couldnt have expected it but it is a rule nonetheless
general 2021-04-26 20:12:03 that doesnt matte
general 2021-04-26 20:12:06 r
general 2021-04-26 20:12:08 it looked suspicious
general 2021-04-26 20:12:12 which is what matters
general 2021-04-26 20:13:40 thats not the point
general 2021-04-26 20:13:44 even if it is harmless
general 2021-04-26 20:13:55 it deserves a warn
general 2021-04-26 20:14:00 because that is a purpose of a warn
general 2021-04-26 20:14:04 it's just a warning
general 2021-04-26 20:14:06 it isnt permanent
general 2021-04-26 20:14:18 its a warning for you to not post suspicious files in the discord server
general 2021-04-26 20:14:54 if you explain what the file is about and post it so that it doesnt have to be downloadable to be viewable then it wont deserve a warn
general 2021-04-26 20:15:01 you have to download it to view it
general 2021-04-26 20:15:18 on discord you do
general 2021-04-26 20:15:48 be less vague
general 2021-04-26 20:16:43 idk ask discord not me
general 2021-04-26 20:17:48 cool
general 2021-04-26 20:17:56 the warn isnt appealable either way
general 2021-04-26 20:17:59 take it and accept it
general 2021-04-26 20:18:04 and dont do anything similar again
general 2021-04-26 20:18:12 its a warning not a punishment
general 2021-04-26 20:18:24 as long as you dont get up to 3 warnings nothing will happen
general 2021-04-26 21:18:43 scammed

general 2021-05-10 08:42:42 no
general 2021-05-10 08:42:47 not realistic
general 2021-05-10 08:42:58 not 60
general 2021-05-10 08:42:59 lame
general 2021-05-10 08:43:12 rescue mission 5 is nowhere near arma
general 2021-05-10 08:43:34 if brm5 was on a percentage bar it would be 5% of the way to arma
general 2021-05-10 08:43:43 fireteam except not many people play it
general 2021-05-10 08:44:11 idk whatever team im on usually wins
general 2021-05-10 08:44:33 so basically
general 2021-05-10 08:44:39 fireteam is only realistic game
general 2021-05-10 08:44:44 oh also tactical assault <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-05-10 09:01:10 polybattle is the concept of bf4 but made in roblox
general 2021-05-10 09:01:41 so its essentially bf4 but diluted to 1% concentration
general 2021-05-10 09:05:47 or just shoot them

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:18:19 on industrial equipment rear wheel steering is more common than usual
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:18:43 you should just remake the whole cab using either camera locks or motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:18:51 and using trails for the frame of the cab
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:20:00 doesnt matter if the cab looks like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:20:22 better to have it look better than to not waste time

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:23 you get 1 kill every 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:24 amazing gameplay
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:41 like i said
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:45 1 kill every 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:38:56 but if you get more than that then there would be more tanks than you can handle
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:39:28 ok like i said if there's a lot of tanks then you'd be dead anyway
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:39:32 and then wirbel is gone
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:39:42 i know thats what im talking about
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:39:49 when you're reloading you get died
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:40:06 plus the wirbel never really works when burst
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:40:11 you said hide in an alley
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:40:17 not exactly easy to retreat
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:40:31 you'll get cornered and die
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:40:56 uhh
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:01 people who are paranoid
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:14 and people who arent stupid and rush in
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:27 you said wirbel not regular tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:36 if they race by you wont get enough shots off
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:40 to destroy them
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:47 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:52 like anyone in wt would ever listen
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:41:55 to their teammates
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:42:54 you need multiple shots to get a kill
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:42:57 while they only need 1 shot
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:43:12 what
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:43:35 yes just shoot the mg port on a t-34
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:43:40 thats the only bulge on a t-34
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:20 russian tanks are prone to fire but usually dont die by them
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:28 you realize plans never work right
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:31 just shoot it
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:35 dont aim for any weak spots
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:40 other than avoiding front plate
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:44:48 why would anyone ever shoot the cannon on a t-34
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:07 there is usually no point in shooting the barrel ever
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:10 i eman
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:12 the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:24 might as well use the extra shots on the tank itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:35 2-3 people in the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:36 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:45:57 usually no reason to shoot the barrel anyway
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:03 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:07 wt is boring anyway
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:14 wot is more fun
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:23 yes aim for the turret on the T29
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:25 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:33 what
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:34 you mean wt right
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:42 it takes weeks for a few tanks on wt
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:48 it takes a day or two on wot
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:46:52 no its way faster now
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:47:12 i got like 5 tier 8 tanks within 2 months
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:47:23 all starting from tier 2-3
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:48:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:48:38 also i start to run out of credits faster than i run out of xp to use on tanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:48:43 both games have credit issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:48:50 but wt is slightly worse i think
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:48:56 cause huge repair cost
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:00 pc
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:09 console had shitty ui changes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:16 and blitz is pc but easier and slightly worse
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:30 wow very original idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:50:42 havent seen that before <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:01 its been done at least once
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:04 back in like 2018
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:25 the size doesnt matter if the idea itself isnt actually that interesting
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 16:51:55 suicide beyblades

plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:08:10 game is boring
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:08:33 its jailbreak with revolvers
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:08:44 it kinda do be
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:08:56 yeah but thats not saying much
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:09:21 the other wild west game is slightly better
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:09:29 but still kinda like jailbreak
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:09:36 westbound i think
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:09:44 its better cause gunplay isnt 80% rng
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:10:24 i dont care if it has more details if the guns dont feel good to use
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:10:33 if the guns arent fun then the entire game isnt fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:10:46 oversimplification is the point of roblox games
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:11:06 still
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:11:28 oversimplification doesnt matter cause most roblox games dont go enough into detail to even have to be oversimplified
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:11:54 both games are pretty shit in my opinion so they're close enough to warrant a comparison
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:12:16 both games are
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:12:25 like i said
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:12:30 both are
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:12:40 cause like i said
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:12:44 the guns don't feel good to use
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:13:19 like at least half of the game is just using guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:13:26 if they aren't good then the game isn't good
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:13:37 you can't just tell me "the guns are good" to convince me that the guns are good
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:14:28 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:00 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:10 if i don't like how the guns work then i don't like how the guns work
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:19 even if i get used to them i won't like them because i just don't like them
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:29 how hard is it to understand that i don't like them
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:36 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:15:47 the guns are mostly rng anyway
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:16:40 i might be confused and swapping the games around here but in westbound as long as your crosshair is placed on someone's head you'll get a headshot
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:17:10 if you can actually aim then you'll hit your targets
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:18:16 the guns dont fire fast enough in either game to have recoil affect the accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:18:53 if you fire too fast in ww you literally hit nothing
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:11 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:17 so why would you fan a revolver
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:22 if you wanted to hit something
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:28 like i said
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:34 rng causes the revolvers to hit nothing even at short range
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:19:55 cool lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:20:18 i can aim perfectly fine in westbound while both me and my target are on horseback
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:21:28 so you're saying a game where the bullets don't go where you want them to is better?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:21:35 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:21:45 im not saying games should have laser accuracy whenever fired
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:22:21 im saying that the bullets literally have rng to the point where you can never predict where they go when you fire even moderately fast even if you accounted for the range
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:22:44 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:22:46 it's my problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:22:51 so i don't play the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:22:55 therefore i think the game is bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:23:13 the game is perfectly fine when playing with snipers cause there's no wind and all you need to account for is bullet drop
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:23:28 but when at close range the rng completely takes over
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:23:38 yes which is very short
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:23:56 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:24:15 it's not just recoil
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:24:20 the bullets don't literally just go straight up
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:24:29 the rng causes the bullets to spread
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:24:30 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:25:08 yeah but i expect them to go somewhere near my crosshair when i'm shooting at someone 10 feet in front of me
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:26:20 if i have my crosshair completely on the lower half of my target and i fan a revolver and the shots go completely to the side of them that's called a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:26:24 i have been trolled
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:26:39 cause apparently randomness is now skill
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:26:56 can you prove it to me
general 2021-06-06 18:28:17 i know
general 2021-06-06 18:28:34 i said guns are fine when firing at a normal rate
general 2021-06-06 18:28:44 dude you do know what bullet spread is right
general 2021-06-06 18:28:51 bullet spread uses rng
general 2021-06-06 18:28:58 the game has bullet spread and recoil at the same time
general 2021-06-06 18:29:28 the bullet spread is too high is the problem for me
general 2021-06-06 18:29:50 if i can aim in literally any other game then the only problem for me is the randomness of the bullet spread
general 2021-06-06 18:30:05 of course i expected it
general 2021-06-06 18:30:13 but it's like the cone is 5x bigger than it should be
general 2021-06-06 18:30:43 is not an argument
general 2021-06-06 18:30:45 is purely
general 2021-06-06 18:30:49 a statement of opinion
general 2021-06-06 18:30:52 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-06 18:31:04 yes
general 2021-06-06 18:31:20 do you want to start an argument about the definition of an argument
general 2021-06-06 18:31:55 yeah the only thing happening is him trying to change my opinion and that i am trying to defend my own
general 2021-06-06 18:32:15 then why does fanning the revolvers in rdr2 have way less spread and recoil
general 2021-06-06 18:32:25 and actually hit where you want them to
general 2021-06-06 18:32:46 cause it's a better game <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-06 18:32:47 is why
general 2021-06-06 18:32:58 probably
general 2021-06-06 18:33:02 last time i played was in 2019
general 2021-06-06 18:33:43 ik
general 2021-06-06 18:33:47 i only used it a few times
general 2021-06-06 18:34:08 cause it was in cqc and it was the only way to fire bullets fast enough to compensate for the slow reaction time
general 2021-06-06 18:35:15 good to know even though i won't play the game again <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-06-09 07:15:25 ship tilt forward and down
general 2021-06-09 07:15:40 tilt causes stress and make ship break
general 2021-06-09 07:15:51 water already in front part of both pieces of ship
general 2021-06-09 07:15:56 both piece keep tilting
general 2021-06-09 07:16:28 theres no logical reason as to how the stern would suddenly fill with water so that it would tilt backwards

general 2021-06-09 14:09:12 what
general 2021-06-09 14:09:23 you said squad or arma
general 2021-06-09 14:09:33 those are only modern shooters
general 2021-06-09 14:09:43 thats war thunder
general 2021-06-09 14:11:17 ok
general 2021-06-09 14:11:27 heroes and generals
general 2021-06-09 14:11:46 post scriptum, hell let loose, squad, arma, insurgency sandstorm
general 2021-06-09 14:12:14 in battlefield its closer to fast paced than the games above but it depends on how you play
general 2021-06-09 14:12:45 the farther back you go into the franchise of battlefield the slower paced it is

general 2021-06-10 19:52:08 the fits
general 2021-06-10 19:52:34 update drivers
general 2021-06-10 20:20:26 you need to already have nitro
general 2021-06-10 20:20:32 its basically nitro extension
general 2021-06-10 20:20:35 not actually free nitro
general 2021-06-10 20:21:10 and it will still bill you if you forget to stop paying for nitro after 3 month end
general 2021-06-11 02:42:39 what purpose would it serve
general 2021-06-11 02:43:05 then just put 2 blocks to the side of the cylinders
general 2021-06-11 02:43:11 so that it wont move side to side
general 2021-06-11 02:43:13 and still spin in place

general 2021-06-11 02:43:26 move what
general 2021-06-11 02:43:40 it completely depends on how you are spinning it

general 2021-06-11 04:10:36 exactly
general 2021-06-11 04:10:44 you need to already have had nitro to get free nitro
general 2021-06-11 04:10:54 so its free nitro for not free nitro users
