the-dump 2020-05-12 01:25:19 
the-dump 2020-05-12 03:14:36 bruh
general 2020-05-12 16:56:00 yes
general 2020-05-12 16:56:07 
general 2020-05-12 16:57:06 1.20 terabytes of ANGER
general 2020-05-12 16:57:26 probably obama's last name
general 2020-05-12 16:58:14 i dont think free speaker would be good at all
general 2020-05-12 16:58:34 it'd just be another addition to colossal lag machines
general 2020-05-12 16:58:45 and then would probably turn into something like noise machines
general 2020-05-12 16:59:18 Speakers stay not for free?
general 2020-05-12 16:59:45 BRUH WHAT
general 2020-05-12 16:59:56 heck u dyno
general 2020-05-12 17:00:04 anyway hmmm
general 2020-05-12 17:00:25 problem would be that everybody would be more mad to have to buy plane crazy to get to their saves
general 2020-05-12 17:00:39 and also bc people make alt accounts with 0 robux to get more save slots
general 2020-05-12 17:01:23 plus I doubt people would buy it because it's just another building game & doesn't bring as much to the table as wild west and bloxburg
general 2020-05-12 17:03:36 250 sounds fair
general 2020-05-12 17:03:44 after all you can play earrape on it
general 2020-05-12 17:03:58 so it's probably there so only a few can have it and be responsible with it
