plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:01:40 new here what dis
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:02:17 don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:02:23 hhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:02:30 tbh, Motor 2 is a godsend
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:03:23 eh
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:03:30 Motor 1's lock is kinda broken
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:03:42 so i don't think adding it to Motor 2 would be better
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:04:54 yep
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:04:58 but still
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:05:06 if it didn't work for a simpler part

plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:25:08 is the first angled motor component supposed to be where the lava lake is?
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:27:46 either I'm blind or I'm looking in the wrong place
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:28:58 ~~something tells me this is just a hoax~~
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:40:56 ok, I give up, I can't find the damn 1st component
I know where the cave and the lab is
but not this thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:41:52 angled motor
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:42:50 how can I check of a server is new/old?
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:43:29 idfk myself
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:44:12 where
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:45:33 how can you even go in the lava without burning to death?
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:46:40 pipe is a dead end
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:47:02 bruh this is just a hoax, there's no angled motor
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:47:36 then where is the first component
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:47:40 **specifically**
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:48:00 I went there, there ain't
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:48:21 also "lab" and "lava lakes" are 2 VERY different responses
plane-crazy 2019-10-09 19:49:21 someone said it was in the cavern in the ocean

general 2019-10-09 20:07:22 ~~tfw you're not banned cuz of your swasticar, but cuz of you saying "Discord"~~

"Roblox is gay"

creations-chat 2020-03-05 20:19:34 A "jet" I've built recently, I call it the Shard
creations-chat 2020-03-05 22:29:41 sorry m8, commander's orders
creations-chat 2020-03-05 22:30:23 also for the 2 people that gave me the downdoot
what can I improve?
bug-reports 2020-03-05 22:40:27 ye that usually happens when you place blocks too quickly or when you place them when the game lags
bug-reports 2020-03-05 23:58:46 tfw you don't anchor your turrets
help 2020-03-06 00:00:59 well, as far as I've noticed, makes movement more sluggish
bot-central 2020-03-06 00:03:14 !rank
help 2020-03-06 00:10:20 Speaking of ranks
If I use a magnet engine in my build, would it still be able to qualify?
(It's not mentioned in the reqs.)
general 2020-03-06 00:20:20 Egypt is both Asian and African

creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:04:13 can someone kindly delete the repost of the second pic?
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:05:35 this thing took ~1.5 hours to build, 2268 blocks + can float ominously mid-air without anchor
creations-chat 2020-04-01 21:05:58 now ima go to sleep, updoot or downdoot as you please
general 2020-04-19 16:40:31 Skis to hover mid-air
general 2020-04-19 16:40:50 Yeah, it's big brain time
general 2020-04-23 10:30:40 guy, gal, gamer
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:11:27 I'd say keep only the edge of the sword light gray
make the blunt part of the blade a slightly darker shade
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:12:24 btw, do y'all like the gradients I used on my thing?
Took me forever to paint
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:13:34 ngl, that tank turret seems pretty impressive
tho what do you use to launch the explosive balls themselves?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:13:49 thanks :D
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:14:00 ah, makes sense
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:14:51 weird
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:15:01 I suggest asking a server mod about it
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:15:34 on what?
creations-chat 2020-08-03 18:17:47 It looks pretty accurate
especially considering that Plane Crazy doesn't have any complex wedges to play with
