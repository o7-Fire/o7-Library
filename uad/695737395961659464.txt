plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:11:10 the only real way of making them effective
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:11:17 is just retrofitting the shit out of them

creations-chat 2021-06-29 15:50:15 remember lads: nowadays its more quantity not quality in the creations channel
(yup)
(i mean i cant say much anyways, my latest vehicle took like 2 hours, yet got decent upvotes)
(prob down to the fact, even i dont motorlock, i can make my builds semi-decent looking)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 15:59:35 w h o ' s  b u i l d ?
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:03:42 mate, i had permission form him: he's my fucking friend.
and by modifying, i literally mean i fucking reconstructed the entire thing, it isnt even the same length anymore, new suspension system, completely new design, went from AWD to FWD ffs
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:12:17 Actually no that brings up the question: why do i get upvotes when my builds are shite:
(and yes i edited this theyre like 2 months apart)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:14:58 mate lemme just summarise whats new on the chassis: new wheelbase, extended chassis by 2 blocks to account for stability, converted the drivetrain to FWD, gave it fucking differential, lowered weight by removing around 20 unnecessary parts from the AWD drivetrain
creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:23:31 realistically mines more "simple" but his one is effectively unusable for making car bodies on, and lags ALOT more due to the excessive amounts of inactive motors
(i essentially built mine to be actually used on vehicles, whilst his can only hold a small cockpit with a few blocks around it, and a decorated engine bay

creations-chat 2021-06-29 16:27:47 ***exactly***
yeah i just dont see why i actually get half decent upvotes compared to say, pouyuto's IS7: i literally got nearly half of that builds upvotes, for a build that took around 2-3 hrs to figure out, compared to a build that prob took 2-3 weeks to make
creations-chat 2021-07-03 15:14:59 unless they did this: 
5hr (or less building)

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:21:37 it's still early stages, im planning on doubling the length to make it even larger
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:21:54 yes, ring
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:22:17 i didnt post it cus i wanted opinions, cus imma admit its a piece of shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:22:41 its just to prove that trailmakers are pure autism
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:22:49 oh i can colour it to make it that
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:23:02 *which i wont*

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:20:45 how much does helium weigh again?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:21:18 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:21:57 wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:22:08 seeming 1 helium block can account for about 9 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:22:18 i just need to figure out how much a block weighs, which is simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:22:25 just lowest setting in ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:23:56 cus what im trying to do
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:24:05 is make a sort of aerial mine system
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:39:32 yup
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:39:34 they work now
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:39:57 ballast doesnt work for it, however
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:40:03 so i used parachutes instead
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:48:48 s l e e p
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 07:14:29 pog idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:21:17 hmm..

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:18 it has warp drive in the nacelles
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:21 but i cant use em
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:30 cus theyre not balanced to the main area of the body
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:34 so it just lifts upwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:37 plus
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:42 i rarely use the impulse
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:49:55 i just put my vtol on and helicopter around

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:18:06 well, i usually use lock for locking my quad wing design together
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:18:28 seeming, tbh, thats all i usually do in terms of planes

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 19:50:06 tipped off the side
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 19:50:08 less than
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 19:50:18 1 minute into getting on the antarctic ice shelf
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 19:50:43 well 1940's US economy, so prob cheap as chips

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 08:03:32 well, tbh, on the outside, theres not much difference, the real difference is on the interior
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 08:14:13 new interior layout of the kharkovchanka, comparing it to the piece of shite outdated by 1 year interior design (never bothered to furnish the old one)
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 08:14:30 heres the old design

plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:31 its what it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:40 the kharkov is literally just a brick on a t54 chassis
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:46 but i cant be asked
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:50 to make the chassis accurate
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:56 the real good part of the new one
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:36:59 is its interior
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:38:40 interior of the new boi
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:39:25 its actually my only attempt at a interior ive ever done
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:39:30 cus usually i do exterior only
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:39:44 and then keep interior bare bones to save weight cus potato pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:40:09 cant show the old kharkov interior
plane-crazy 2021-09-13 17:40:13 cus i deleted it

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:36:51 imma just continue making my J7 lookalike
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:24:26 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/811930290897027123/889079044677705788/New_Plane_Design.jpg is this a good idea for a paintjob that imma use on my new plane?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:24:51 well its not the actual J7 Shinden
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:25:02 its just a theoretical "modernised" version
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:25:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:25:27 im making something like it rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:25:45 
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:26:43 niet, sadly
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:27:36 thats a "post war" art design
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:27:41 but the design did exist
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:27:44 just not like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:28:28 
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:28:30 only a few concept bodies existed of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:28:40 but they were planning to use it to intercept B29's
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:29:13 its not a modified japanese plane Imao
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:29:27 EXACTLY.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:29:56 mate thats pretty much exactly what it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:30:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:31:04 they almost always look like some alternate history plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:31:25 b r u h .
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:32:00 damm
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:32:12 4 30mm's in the one they wanted to build irl
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:36:50 nah
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:36:54 it wasnt built for that at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:36:59 but i see why you think that
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:37:17 the only reason im building stuff like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:37:24 is cus i want a series of bullpup planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:40:39 god, im just looking back to how bad my builds were early this year
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:40:47 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/801515294107238430/2021-01-20_3.png?width=1202&height=676
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:41:15 though ngl
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:41:23 i still am proud of my first big build
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:41:31 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/797220564615299113/2021-01-08_8.png?width=1202&height=676

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:41:54 then that turned into this
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:00 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/825424525545046106/2021-03-27_7.png?width=1202&height=676

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:09 then this
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:28 thats all
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:35 its a 8 month evolution
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:37 though
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:41 im planning to make a 4th one
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:42:50 to make it accurately sized
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:43:41 ngl, im still suprised that i havent gotten any negative downvotes in terms of the upvote/downvote scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:44:26 well
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:44:35 theyre great, for something that isnt motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:44:43 i've basically never used motorlocking heavily
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:44:58 but man you can tell in some builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:45:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:45:09 no motorlock, save for a few half block motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:45:40 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/874621854105608232/2021-08-10_5.png?width=1202&height=676 this used only 2 sets of small locks
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:47:42 yeah
general 2021-09-19 12:40:47 so uh
general 2021-09-19 12:40:56 anyone know a way to make compact contra-rotating props?
general 2021-09-19 14:08:27 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:10:00 i just realised
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:10:08 how much space my new plane has
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:29:34 wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:29:36 someone else
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:29:40 who makes land cruisers?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:29:47 ***n a n i?***
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:30:27 also sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:30:32 the vehicle on the rights, mine
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:30:45 Kharkovchanka boi
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:31:03 oh good fcking god
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:31:11 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:31:15 I SWEAR IVE SEEN YOU BEFORE
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:33:53 how does the vehicle look rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:34:21 well its just me attempting to make a modernised J7 Shinden
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:34:32 aka that one japanese bullpup config plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:34:41 with the engine at the rear
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:35:17 also it barely used motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:35:23 rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:35:48 oh so it docks together?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 19:18:12 welp, updated the shinden ii i have
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 19:18:44 gave it actually accurate cannon mount positions, alongside new paintjob, smoothed out the bodywork, new designations, more stable flight, better landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 19:18:45 etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:29:29 god its weird to think, that this 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743505980293382228/870254112825049088/2021-07-29.png 
is technically a descendant of this (in terms of development)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/743505980293382228/891038478958198837/2021-09-24_1.png
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:30:15 went from Swordfish II to being a J7 Shinden but Modernised slightly
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:43:15 instead of oversimplified
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:48:05 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:48:09 imma make a sorta
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:48:17 development tree
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:48:19 for my vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 20:53:05 well i already know how the main fighter tree works

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:01:27 idk what to build next for my Pusher-configuration plane style
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:01:37 all i have rn is a finished off fighter, which is alright i spose
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:03:04 im focusing on making actual aircraft rn, i've had next to none for over a year
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:03:34 b r u h
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:03:44 mate read the first msg
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:03:51 im focusing aswell on building pusher planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:03:58 that are PROPELLORS.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:05:05 not pushers, though
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:05:33 all jets are pusher's :wheeze:
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:05:52 well, all conventional jets
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:06:05 the idea of pusher only applies really to props
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:06:08 cus push pull
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:06:22 pull planes are stuff like p51, p47, yak-3, spitfire, etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:06:49 based more on the J7 Shinden
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:06:58 aka the japanese one
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:07:07 XP55 looksa bit bland tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:07:27 though in reality, i just based it on this design
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:08:02 
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:08:31 and no i didnt draw this
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:11:10 https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/37976223 this guy did
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:14:36 h m m m
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:15:53 oh yeah, that
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:16:05 i wasnt talking bout upvotes though, idc bout them tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:16:22 most ive gotten is something like 60
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:17:23 yeah around 60
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:17:25 for me
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 16:17:30 for something i didnt even try on

plane-crazy 2021-09-26 16:28:56 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 16:29:14 idk what to do for my pusher plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:37:55 indeed.
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:38:00 . . . .
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:38:31 only on pvp :wheeze:
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:38:41 plus if you have more than 1 braincell you can easily kick their asses
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:39:06 i dont even try killing em with guns, i just maneuever kill them into lava or the island rotors
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:39:23 :troll:
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:39:36 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:41:25 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:41:39 do i bother finishing my pusher plane or make a new plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:41:54 i've made like 3 diff versions of this pusher plane i have
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:42:27 technically 4 if i count the EC-12 concept i did but that was just to see if could malform my Swordfish II Zipcraft into a Pusher plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:44:18 honestly i have no fcking clue what to build after my pusher plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:45:11 exquited, Hbt is either 8 or theyre just doing a troll
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:45:22 most likely the first choice
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:45:51 might do something like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:46:41 mate this is 2021, its not the fcking inquistion, we can swear
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 16:47:15 alright then

creations-chat 2021-09-27 17:57:08 opinions on my new concept J9-3 "Haast" Interceptor?
(basically took my J7W1 Shinden and started evolving it. this is the 3rd evolution of the original J7 i have.)
<@!715148402022678608> nope, i did not, Imao - they do use J7 Shindens, but this is essentially the J7 but on overdrive
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:01:29 thanks for the reccomendation, just suprised how well it turned out. heres a photo of the og J7 i have had for about a month (its my 2nd plane ive ever officially built)
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:04:16 thats cus the TPTP uses the J7 Shinden, but slightly modernised, like this
<@!715148402022678608> oh crap i almost forgot, i had the 2nd evolution of it aswell
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:07:07 tried to give it a more naval look on this scheme, to the point i once gave it folding wings..if you see the placement of the gear, i think you can guess how that turned out
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:10:53 yeah, the main idea for Evo 2 was to smooth out the parts on the rear and give it a more cleaner appearance, alongside a engine boost system, more guns, and a partially reworked flight system
creations-chat 2021-09-27 18:13:58 yeah, the design just looks very vulpen-esque, but very nice build nonetheless
afk, got to do some stuff.
<@!823746304348782613> it just looks like something the mad vulpen wouldve made, but with more detail. were not saying its a tut, just looks like something a tutorial creator wouldve done
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:24:31 the plane layout itself or the bodywork?
if the layout, thats just a pusher plane layout for props (engine at the back doing reverse thrust)
if its the bodywork, i dont angle lock.

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:51:07 youll see what hes talking bout

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 22:04:21 Aka this engine (spent like 5 minutes scrolling on my 7yr old backup device, pure agony trying to find it)
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:57:35 fuck it
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:57:53 imma make the (fictional) Savoia S.21
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:58:00 aka Porco Rosso boi
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:24:05 hmm, thoughts on my kitbashed Savoia S.21 (fictional plane from the Studio Ghibli film "Porco Rosso" 
I only built this cus the engine i made looked good, the bodydoesnt suit it
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:38:41 yeah, as i said, kitbashed. i didnt intend on this being a fully accurate remake, just wanted to test my floatplane skills (its my 1st attempt in general.)
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:43:34 right imma go make a schneider trophy boi with the engine now.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:51:08 fixed the paint scheme, but imma start working on the front now
creations-chat 2021-10-13 17:55:04 yeah, im intending on adding a bunch of stuff for it, whilst also making the Piccolo S.P.A hangar
also going to redo the engine bay. cus its too detailed

thanks for the feedback, really helped alot
creations-chat 2021-10-15 20:13:22 LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO-

(mightve just ammoracked a battleship with a fictional floaty boi)
creations-chat 2021-10-16 11:50:02 thoughts on the Savoia S.21 ive been working on? (older photo, updated it today.) im open for feedback, i just really need ideas for the continuation of it.
yes i know theres no angle locking on the body, nor the wings, i just dont want to spend the next 2 years trying to hide the locks.
creations-chat 2021-10-16 12:00:47 thats the point, the Savoia S21 is a fictional plane from Porco Rosso, its intentionally bright

creations-chat 2021-10-16 18:50:56 <@!709090921337192530> cus it looks like you made it on a stone tablet, thats why
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:03:19 simple one i recently tried. not my best effort, cus i wanted something just nice and simple.
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:23:09 ayyy, someone who recognises it
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:30:35 and on that, an even smaller train
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:35:26 it looks worse, ill admit - maybe do some angle locking?
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:38:20 fair enough. just remember once youve gotten better at angle locking, to try again. best of luck
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:45:24 i need ideas on what to add on this, or around it, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:47:26 trust me, if i couldve made it 1:1 scale with actually good detail, i wouldve.
creations-chat 2021-10-16 19:49:30 well, where shall i position the naval guns?
oh wait...i know just the idea.
***how bout i place 2 naval guns on the undersides of the wings, and make them have comically large recoil?***

plane-crazy 2022-04-06 22:56:20 to delete nearly all my builds
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 22:59:02 the sheer amount of regret i am suffering from at this moment is incredible

:troll:
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:13:35 hmm, i might apply for the easiest ranks to achieve, expert designer v
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:21:29 already did Imao, i just couldnt be asked to actually request it
ngl they should rework the designer rank, higher standards

exactly, now that the server is so damm big, they really need to rework some of the ranks
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:25:02 ngl im kinda suprised i dont see the pixel artist rank so often, that rank is ridiculously easy to get if you think about it
creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:45:19 :wheeze:

this is his, unfinished, and looks "somewhat" similiar
explain that then.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:08:53 explain why its in another plot and showing the camera's on the side then :wheeze:
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:13:03 freak coincidence.
1) those arent default colours, you can tell (only red ingame is 255,0,0, and the 3 greens are too bright to be the same)
2) they literally have identical front cockpit glass, alongside alot of other identical details
1) common plane type, sure, but doesnt mean everyone mass produces the *exact* same model (save the vulpen B17)

anyways im getting bored of this
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:17:03 right i need ideas on what to actually make in plane crazy, i've pretty much reset my save data, so i need some more stuff to fill out the vacuum
*im not making a jet.*
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:19:34 sure looks default to me.
im tired of this petty shit.

so i can point out stuff, i delete em later cus i have no reason to keep something like that.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:21:45 does that make it default? no, it doesnt.
creations-chat 2022-04-07 01:28:30 we kinda were talking bout that, goose. might wanna look back a little bit.

creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:43:18 facts :wheeze:
i mean, just look at creations right now.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:46:00 so? the community will still accept non locked builds, it doesnt immediately downvote a build that isnt locked to all hell Imo
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:52:25 right ive got a question:
why tf did this ass build of mine get a positive upvote ratio?

<@887517130248056903> custom design "LF-5 Comorant" based on designs from elite dangerous
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:55:38 repetitive af to look at, doesnt really have anything that stands out, also the detail itself is of incredibly low quality (especially the cannons). colour scheme is pretty boring aswell, everything is the same tone of grey.
also, *how many emojis?*

right, sure, because i've played with you on plane crazy before, i know for a fact your designs are more for functionality over looks. but still, most of the time, the community prefers looks over function.
creations-chat 2022-04-08 21:58:12 we arent getting mad, we're just criticising your creation, is that not allowed anymore? (well, i am anyways.)

<@357550075507113994> decent design, but as rodaxty said, needs more details. also is that colourscheme ww1 inspired?
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:00:31 okay i am gonna point out something a bit bullshit for me:
**how in gods name did this get positive upvotes (21 up - 8 down)**
***where ya'll on something when you judged my 2nd creation i ever posted?***
didnt upload ffs <:pain:644301805534183464>

i could point out so much thats shit with this, im genuinly astonished how this got more uvpotes than down
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:05:36 like, what the fck is that rudder shape, what is the camo pattern :Wheeze:
<@887517130248056903> better than my first design, i genuinely thought that diamond plate = more armour when i first made a boat
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:07:47 nah im just questioning why the server thought it was good Imao

plane-crazy 2022-07-09 13:09:02 h e h
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 13:09:12 now to figure out how to make a actual working hovercraft
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 13:09:33 instead of just being a shitlord and using hover thrusters or by spamming small props
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 13:18:07 before i do that, however
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 13:18:38 what should i paint the main body of this in?
general 2022-07-09 14:02:23 you mean the entirety of roblox right?
general 2022-07-09 14:02:31 :troll:
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:02:46 dont have high enough rank
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:03:00 its to prevent unde's from spamming the server, or bots doing the same thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:03:02 just chat for a while
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:03:08 and youll get a high enough rank
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:03:15 i think its like lvl 3 to get image perm
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:36:15 buddy
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:36:19 you really thought'
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:36:25 that pc2 would be in the summer?
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:36:34 short summary
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:37:06 pc2's in development hell right now, so i'd extend that release date to be late 2022 or early 23
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:37:24 the current **planned**
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:37:31 not really
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:37:57 4.9k player atm, and has been going strong since 2014
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:38:10 so i highly doubt the games gonna die out by the end of this year
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:38:38 for christ's sake, the discord server alone has over 30k member
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:40:02 *i dont dedicate my life to being a plane crazy-tard, so nah i couldnt care less if long time members leave*
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:40:22 i left this community for about 5 months
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:40:26 cus i ran out of ideas
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:40:32 got severe burnout
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:41:31 its only boring down to the fact at how little there is left to do
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:41:48 so yeah, the playerbase will die off a *little* bit by the time of pc2's release
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:41:59 but i doubt the entire playerbase will have just left the game
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:42:12 you dont really need new content on a voxel game
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:42:22 where you build literally everything for yourself
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:42:48 *welcome to roblox buddy*
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:43:01 **this aint a triple a studio we're talking bout*
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:43:22 though tbh im confused
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:43:29 why is there a modeler rank for this server
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:43:37 what tf do they even do now?
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:43:59 ah
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:44:15 right, that makes more sense
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:44:27 cus i was thinking about how pointless a dedicated modelling team would be
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:44:30 for a game that just uses
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:44:33 wedges and cubes
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:44:53 e x a c t l y
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:45:40 tbh the main issue with the game, aside from the bugs, the tiny map size, and other noticeable things
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:45:48 is that the playerbase has just been diluted way too much
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:46:45 it pains me when i enter a server only to find its full of sh*tbox builds with no paint whatsoever
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:47:10 it also means people who are pretty meh think theyre god's gift at plane crazy, because they keep seeing sh*tbox builds 99% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:47:42 and another thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:47:51 i wish people would just learn to be more fucking creative
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:48:09 instead of just making a F18 or any other US or Soviet design
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:48:54 it gets so f#cking tiring to just see the exact same grey paintjob, "hyper-manueverable" jet, being piloted by someone who cant even aim the damm thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:49:57 right rant over
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:49:58 i need ideas
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 14:50:08 on what to make
general 2022-07-14 17:24:25 basically chipotle occured for UK

plane-crazy 2022-07-17 14:41:29 theres a tut on the internet but i wouldnt really reccomend relying on tuts
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 14:41:57 lemme see if i can find it
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 14:42:32 eh im too lazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 14:43:04 im just wondering whether i should waste my time attempting to make a actual functioning hovercraft
creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:53:46 i need ideas on how to paint this, the previous and current paint scheme look shit
(also isn't finished)

ik, it just looks bland
creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:56:51 I mean, the paintscheme with dark green would still look a bit bland, but i suppose a dark blue-ish grey (abit like that of the russian naval vessels, or the german panzer force's metal) would look good

textures i tend to not use, mainly because it rarely works well on how i do my builds

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:12:04 Eh, tis fine
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:12:31 Having little to no stable wifi does give me a good excuse to actually go out and do stuff in my new area

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:20:58 The delta wing one just looks like some mf thunderbirds design
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:22 Why tf 4 engines on a delta wing design
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:29 Thats just..
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:35 Okay nah
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:40 Feel free to make it
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:45 Its just my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:21:52 That that looks weird af
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:22:07 Yeah but the wingspan just works for it
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:22:20 Delta wings plus multiple engines just doesnt look right
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:22:44 Plus it looks like a b1 lancer but blursed
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:23:10 Eh
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:23:30 Tbh thats always a thing with jet bombers
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:23:38 Look at the b52 for example
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:23:59 Make a motorlocked cluster munitions system built into a rotary bomb bay
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:24:22 B57 Canberra rotary bomb bay now
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:24:55 Wait a sec

plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:26:42 (3 props)
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:26:45 Then
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:26:55 Shoved guns onto the prop blades
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:27:07 Turns out the sheer rotational speed on the rotors
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:27:14 Causes the guns paths to deviate
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 22:27:17 Essentially

creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:46:35 i'd say any actual post-image edits to the build itself shouldn't be allowed (ie afterburner effects, custom decals that arent possible in PC) , but stuff like generalised editing to the whole image (e.g greyscale, period-style camera quality) would be fine.
shaders are okay aswell, but theyre sorta like autotune 
just a whitename's opinion, tis all.
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:49:23 yeah, theyre fine, its just they do substantially boost upvotes, cus of "hurr durr better image"
though sometimes it does result in such things as that goof-ass fiat or whatever it was

creations-chat 2022-10-07 17:37:29 idk why but when i hear that "norfolken" faction, i just get reminded of the UK county norfolk

plane-crazy 2022-10-07 17:38:34 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 17:38:52 gave me a reason to get off my ass and finish off some stuff in KSP
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:34:26 nah
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:34:42 mainly its a case of overcoming friction by sheer power
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:34:58 i can usually get my Feldreb mech to do 700-900 sps
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:07 yet again, sheer power
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:15 though
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:20 with fabric wheels
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:22 its a bit different
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:43 fabric is the material with the highest friction
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:46 so either way
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 19:35:52 it will still hinder your speed

plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:03:12 ahh, right
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:03:18 makes sense now, cheers for the info
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:03:37 though, how are they bugged now?
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:03:55 because now it seems i can write and edit text fine, without any error of it reverting to "config to edit"
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:04:01 oh no not that
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:04:05 it doesnt do that for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:04:23 oh wait

creations-chat 2022-10-19 18:36:22 <@1009503593457537215> quick question, what stage of development is the ISS you posted in creations? it doesnt seem to look like the 2022 version, with the newer modules
creations-chat 2022-10-19 23:15:40 Make a lawn dart and call it the F104 instead, seems about right <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-10-21 15:55:38 holy shit
creations-chat 2022-10-21 17:14:49 preposterous, people arent shitting on each others builds? what has PCC come to?!
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:30:10 thats worth a creations blacklist <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:34:37 eh, i could get ranks, but i cant be bothered
(plus ranks are pretty meaningless nowadays cus of how many plebs have it)
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:38:29 <@567763933952475157> does this suffice?
(older model, but i wont repost until ive made actually significant changes to it)
actually unique build instead of [insert generic shitty american/russian jet here]
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:40:36 i know its mid, but the ratio decided otherwise <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:43:20 hows the standards here then, back 7 months ago.

i agree Imao
i got a even worse example from me if you want to see that
creations-chat 2022-10-21 18:45:45 check my older builds, then youll see how fucked standards were

<@733873141549629440> is that a akagi pfp i spot
creations-chat 2022-11-20 19:57:11 Thats prob due to its landing craft/assault vessel role, that type of ship always ends up looking very odd
creations-chat 2022-11-20 19:59:31 Ngl i still want to see someone make a proper Merchant-CV, it'd be nice to see for once, instead of the generic carriers everyone makes
(Usually retrofitted oil tankers)
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:01:33 Best thing is, they still function as cargo ships, whilst being able to operate ASW aircraft
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:06:56 Completely different, they arent purpose built, often retrofitted from a ACTUAL merchant ship, and arent buikt by the US.
They also maintain merchant cargo capacity, so also have that extra benefit. 
Though they serve a similar purpose, the merchant carrier (or MAC) were built as replacements for the escort carriers, as the US couldnt sustain the rates at which u boats torped said escort carriers.
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 20:11:09 Well there has been worthy builds, its just nobody upvotes them enough

general 2022-11-20 21:54:36 Maybe a decent livery would do

creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:29:19 Yeah, those early vipers come from that late 90s/early 00s era where everything looked really cheap, and low quality


<@718416920474288149> Its a early viper.
<@577930642520801301> it isnt that model, its a gen 1 ffs

plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:09:21 I mean if i recall
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:09:31 You can go into the e+ range
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:09:51 so, for example
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:10:03 2.532e87
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:10:27 So 2.532 with 87 digits after that
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 01:10:49 But my memory of the games speed mechanics is rather patchy

creations-chat 2022-11-21 01:34:59 Dumb asf question but

Does anyone know if it is possible to make something always aim towards spawn, even during flight
(Without user input to keep it aiming)

(Yet again, without user input. I want to use it as a sorta guiding system for any ships using jump drives)
bug-reports 2022-11-21 01:37:41 Why is it always you who says that pc2 is cancelled
creations-chat 2022-11-21 01:38:18 I might just see if i can find Trebox again and ask him, or ask some of UNCF, seeming if anyone's made guiding tech for jump drives, itll be them

creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:39:02 man wouldnt it be amazing if people just took criticism and didnt rose-tint their view of their own builds, instead of whinging about how they didnt get showers of praise, and how a build that genuinely looked better despite its lack in """complexity""" got more upvotes
you wrote a essay which began with, and i quote "how the fuck does this get upvotes and mine doesnt". how is that not complaining
both looked shit, but his one didnt look like it had fucking smallpox
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:42:22 it isnt the fact its a essay, its the fact you literally whined about how 1 build did better than your build, only defending how your build looked like a fucking plague victim because of """functionality"""
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:46:49 hmm yes, saying yours isn't better, sure sure

i dont really care at this point its just funny af seeing you trying to make structured responses on a server that revolves around making things on the funni construction game
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:49:57 complained about its looks, then your excuse was that your build didnt get upvotes cus of "functionality"

*what colour should i paint it in?* 
white just seems way too bland, but i dont want to use anything too flashy, like red/blue/etc, but i also dont want to use a more generic scheme, like green/yellow. any ideas?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 13:31:52 maybe a sorta pendulum system could work, as to shift the weight
only issue is that'd take alot of space up, and would be fairly complicated
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:28:20 wait, do you have any photos of your Savoia S21 (Porco's Plane)?
how did i not notice that-
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:30:25 i made one ages ago, but personally im not proud of it at all, comically oversized and way too wide, also lacked alot of details.

plane-crazy 2022-12-22 16:36:24 hmmm....which one?
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 16:44:57 personally i'd go for the 2nd one

help 2022-12-24 17:49:21 1) dont take other peoples shit, masquerade around acting as if its yours, then when you're busted, say it was a "joke"
2) *actual* advice: learn to build through practical knowledge, in this case, making your own shit. sure, it'll take time, and alot of trial and error, but you learn your actual limits, and building style, instead of just copying notes from someone who's already done it. also, dont judge your builds against other players builds, especially those who have had much longer to get actually good at what they make - it'll just end up with you being jealous, salty, and a downright annoying prick.

creations-chat 2022-12-26 00:10:50 That canopy, just looks quite simply ridiculous, in regards to the scale of the aircraft itself. Theres no good points, just make it taller, for God's sake.

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:16:58 Welp, i need ideas on what to make next, im stumped.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:17:35 I made a 4x4, proud of it, but it didn't satiate my desire to make a array of good builds.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:18:14 I've got a twin prop heavyfighter that goes 6.3k kf that counts.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:18:45 I mean, i dont need to learn from stuff Imao
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:19:28 Been playing for a fair while, i just ran out of ideas.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:19:42 Folks, most cold war jets are overmade
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:20:00 Ehh, more a jack of all trades
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:20:07 I build what i want to build.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:21:03 For example
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:21:39 I havent made any boats in over 2 years, until 3 months back, when i just decided to make a Merchant-Carrier for no reason.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:23:12 (Merchant Carriers are just converted merchant ships with a flight deck to carry ASW aircraft. They also still function as merchant ships.)
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:23:51 I also for some reason, went through a phase of making all my smaller aircraft 2 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:24:37 Then i also had a phase of pusher-prop planes, like the J7W1 Shinden
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:24:55 (I dont make jets, never have, theyre all too common)
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:25:23 Actually, disregard that, i do make jets, just not a traditional jet engine (i make pulse jet planes)
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 00:25:55 The engine type the V1 used

plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:29:31 Irredeemable
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:29:43 Unless you did a full rebuild
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:30:17 I mean, i cant comment much, im a whitename myself
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:30:43 But holy fuck whitenames deserve the mockery they get
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:32:30 I'm only a whitename for 2 reasons tbf:
1) its funny lo
2) i dont believe most of my builds are rank worthy at all, most of them just got lucky ratios
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:32:57 Well, the ones i posted anyways
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:33:27 I mean the only incentive to get ranks is so i can access more stuff, but eh
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:33:56 I mean if i did get downvote bombed
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:34:04 Id genuinely ask for criticism
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:34:11 And shut up,and listen
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:34:22 Not whine because im being told i did shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:36:13 Like im sorry but
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:36:18 This shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:36:24 
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:36:32 Didnt deserve thst much
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:36:36 Not at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:37:07 It just got herd-minded into 217 upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:37:35 I just refuse to ask for ranks on that build of mine
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:38:00 Hell lemme see
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:38:17 I think my other feldreb got 117 upvotes aswell
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:38:46 God fucking why
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:38:53 
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:39:06 *161* upvotes for that piece of shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:39:34 I get the joke but
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:39:37 Ehh
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:40:45 I like looking at older builds tbf

plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:41:14 Im guessing yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 01:41:22 Indeed

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:08:35 *how do you get the motivation to build as many designs as you have posted in creations?*
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:09:25 So like me but
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:09:30 Without the perma burnout
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:09:57 Ive been """improving""" the same builds for close to 2 years now
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:10:12 Because i ran out of ideas
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:10:42 Well
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:11:03 I sorta just stuck to making Feldrebs and pusher prop planes
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:11:46 Technically ive been making the same pusher prop design since 2020, because it was a branchout from when i made a Swordfish II from cowboy bebop for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:12:43 Like, ffs

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:15:53 so, are the legs going to be
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:15:58 functional, or nonfunctional
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:16:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:16:41 functional usually looks cool and gives you flexxing rights, but also is useless if you're actually going to fight with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:16:43 alright
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 10:16:51 ive got the layout for that then

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:19:59 
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:20:01 there is no context
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:21:46 So basically you guys are tryna make sure some neat shit in pc doesnt get found out, correct?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:22:04 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:22:35 Besides i think i have a idea what you lot are on about, not in mechanics, just what the actual product is
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:29:11 Watching this chat is like watching feds chatting to each other lo
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:33:23 We all are, pal
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:36:49 The pylons connecting them?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:37:37 Also, ive just got a really f*cking stupid question, that i should've asked 2 or so years ago
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:37:58 Does camera lock reset for everyone whenever they swap builds or join a diff server
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:38:46 Right, cheers for clarifying that, I've always been confused on it for years now
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:39:15 I would use camera lock, but i can't be bothered to redo every setting whenever i swap servers
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:39:50 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:40:53 Now i kinda just want to figure out how to make some advanced, *maybe* heavily glitch oriented, tech on pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:41:16 Not "glitch drives", thats not really a glitch at this point
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:41:56 Hm.
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:42:23 Screw it, ill rebuild the AAA Wunder again, and use it for my test-rigs
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:43:09 least secretive pc player
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:43:45 I mean with core tech i get it
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:44:14 Because of how fucked it'd be if the majority of pcc plebs got it
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:44:32 That'd prob kill PC in alot of ways
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:47:34 Well
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:47:36 As i said
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:47:43 If that core tech went public
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:47:51 PC as a whole would go to shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:47:58 If it went big
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:48:22 Exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:49:02 I mean i don't know any of these mechanisms practically, i just hear of them often
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:49:30 So im just sat here with some outdated "glitch" tech from early 2021
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:50:24 Wait, another dumb question
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 00:51:06 Are the individual gold bars in the gold bars block their  own separate hitbox?

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 15:58:38 I cant be bothered to consult my aircraft book
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:00:12 Hmm, lemme just consult my civilian aircraft encyclopedia for seaplanes
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:00:23 S21 is too basic

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:15 Nope
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:24 Not wt
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:26 Wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:30 You talking boit wt
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:35 Or pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:45 Then no
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:14:58 BASED INDIVIDUALS
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:01 THATS WHO
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:08 Sadly no
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:29 Only TNT armour can, and thats just for sweatlords
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:15:56 TNT Armour by default is pretty useless unless you have adequate spacing
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:14 Remember, missiles dont just explode on the angle it hit
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:20 Its a 360 circle of damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:32 So basically it becomes like a HESH round
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:52 Sure, it doesnt pen, but everything inside, motor towers, motor 2s, etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:16:55 Are ficked
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:16 Or we just have
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:31 A modular gun design system, like how sprocket has
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:17:38 But thatd be a pain in the ass to code
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:18:11 That'd also have shit balancing issues
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:07 Well, missiles dont give a toss about armour, they do a full sphere of effect
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:16 So unless you make your tank comically large
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:23 Tnt armour doesnt mean shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:44 Its why i always just prefer
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:19:49 A mobility doctrine
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:05 Rather than slugging it out directly
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:19 Yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:23 Youd need to
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:40 Have the TNT armour a fair few blocks away from anything important
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:46 So the sphere of effect
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:20:54 Doesnt hit the important stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:21:06 Also
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:21:11 What in gods name is this
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:21:16 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:22:15 Also
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:22:22 Does anyone know if
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:22:40 Blocks absorb the shots fired by a gun?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:23:11 Cus if yes, then TNT armour has some reliable use when close to a important module
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:23:26 Nono
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:23:34 Ah shite
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:23:38 So in general
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:04 Tnt blocks kinda shite unless the build has a large void between the armour and important parte
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:24:19 Drip
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:25:53 Would be a shame if my unfinished ZA-35 SPAAG would fire at it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:27:44 Right jokes aside
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:27:59 Do i bother to put a interior into this?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:28:20 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:28:29 Got rid of the monkey msg
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:28:33 Bot took its time
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:28:54 A contraption
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:30:10 I would use camera lock, but i cant be bothered to redo every single fucking lock everytime i server swapped
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:31:34 I need more opinions whether or not I should add a interior into the turret
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:31:59 2 seats, each have about a 2x2 cube in space to add stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:32:39 Your in PCC, the hell did you expect

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:38:26 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:38:37 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:38:43 Its been done alot
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:39:18 Though most "roscale" builds are actually smaller than they should be, by alot
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:39:51 Cant tell, goofy angle
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:40:01 Indeed

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:41:49 Id say that's fairly close to real scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:42:00 Maybe a little small though
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:42:29 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2023-01-21 17:42:33 So basically a bunch of incessant bullshit and lies, and when they actually try to do something of use, it backfires spectacularly?

Seems about right
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:43:55 Drip
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:44:16 Kinda makes me want to rebuild a S21
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:44:28 Made one ages ago, lemme find it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:46:21 oversized, and the main frame was way too wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:47:16 I more or less built it as a excuse to use that engine
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:55:08 Welp imma go figure out how to make a mechanism like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:55:52 CVRT Shielder with a minelayer system on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:56:30 Cringe, i will not resort to such deviancy.<:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:56:51 Ik how to, i just dont want to start it now
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:57:22 I drew up the mechanism for it awhile ago, just it wont be like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:57:45 Idc about angling them, i just want to make a compact minelayer system
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:58:04 Easy
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:58:26 Toggle the primer, and put the impact speed at 5
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:58:44 So you can launch it, then prime the TNT, then bam, mines
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:59:00 Sure theyre basic af
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:59:28 Eh, its for land use obviously, and most pvp land vehicles are slow af
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 17:59:57 Cus yknow, half of all pvp users are either vulpen tuts, or white boxes with every gun on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:00:09 Chad
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:00:46 I mean i have a working minelauncher system that i sketched awhile ago
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:00:49 But
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:00:56 Idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:16 Thats essentially a roller mine sweeper
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:22 So, single use
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:35 Flail types are WAAY better
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:43 But hard to make effective on pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:51 Well
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:01:58 Ill try explain it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:02:20 Yknow how alot of pvp builds are using that railgun tnt launcher nam nam made?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:02:41 Well
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:03:03 Basically think of that, but extended to be wider, and with a completely different system
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:03:45 Kinda shit way to explain tbf
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:04:09 Basically think like a missile rack, but it instead launches mines a short distance
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:05:17 Yeah, it was just a basic example of what i kinda meant
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:05:38 Idk any real comparable things to what im describing
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:05:51 Does a centrifugal cannon count?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:06:19 Well then i exist
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:06:33 And i use a centrifugal cannon on my anti ship plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:06:57 https://tenor.com/view/fade-away-oooooooooooo-aga-emoji-crumble-gif-20008708
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:07:43 I mean if listening to KINO counts then yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:07:54 Wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:08:25 <@619312093962829849>  do you actually know what im referring to when i say centrifugal cannon?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:08:45 Explain what yoi think im referring to rq
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:07 Most people call it a railgun, but its more a centrifugal design
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:13 Nope
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:19 Yknow those
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:27 Legacy missile cannons
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:35 That spin the shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:37 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:09:50 I call em centrifugal cannons for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:16 Theyre basically my go to for a reliable long range "fuck you" gun
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:30 Legacy options means missiles are affected by rotational speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:47 So, if you attach them to a spinner, they go a fuckton faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:59 Yup
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:16 Overcomplex
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:19 Less reliable
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:21 Too large
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:26 Limited rounds
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:32 It aint
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:34 Look
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:37 ILl show a design
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:43 On my old feldreb
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:17 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:23 That back part is the spinbreech
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:48 Alot faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:54 Needs to be legacy option though
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:13:11 Physics in pc, thats why
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:13:50 Only reason i use them, is because theyre reliable for long range shots
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:13:54 Plus
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:14:02 Naval vessels become useful
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:14:19 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:14:45 I mean, i solved it by using a mix of controls, and a aligned gun camera
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:14:58 Also attached it to a very limited arc turret design
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:09 So it can fine tune hits
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:47 Im talking like
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:53 6¬∞ tops
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:59 In angling
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:16:07 So basically fuck all,
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:16:34 But useful for a more accurate shot, and means i dont need to aim the plane each time i want to slightly reaim the shot
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:17:16 Pretty pointless, missiles in high speed in general are very hit or miss
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:17:24 Due to server latency
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:18:01 I mainly stay away from fighting above 1.5k, because then it just goes down to which hits will be registered by the server first
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:18:17 Also this anti ship plane is like comparable to the P108 in size
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:18:30 So it aint exactly a fast plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:19:12 I mean for long range shots, i use a telescope design
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:19:16 Helps a bit
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:19:24 But is a pain to set in place
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:21:07 Theyre fairly easy to learn
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:22:50 3 tips
1) dont fire too often on the move, the shots will disperse
2) wait until all rounds have returned if you fired them all at once, or you risk a spinbreech detonation
3) turrets are a massive pain in the ass with spinbreeches, so it only works well if you specifically designed the spinbreech in mind
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:23:40 Good idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:24:06 I generally reccomend a 4 chamber spinbreech, 2 chamber if you want a very compact one
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:24:47 Ehh, yesnt
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:24:57 That does work, but the missiles go too slow
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:25:04 Not enough power
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:25:05 So
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:25:49 Unpowered motor, connected to a stick, with missiles facing the way you want to fire, and rocket engines on spoolup spinning clockwise or anticlockwise
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:26:16 On/off rockets work, but are prone to causing spinbreech detonations
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:26:38 Yes....
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:26:40 But.
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:26:47 They spin so fast
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:26:54 The motors break
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:27:16 It does work, so long as you dont go near full power
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:27:40 It breaks the mechanism until it slows down
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:27:48 And also
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:28:00 Causes a shitton of centrifugal force
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:28:14 So you can cause a spinout if you do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:28:29 Nono, the force gets so high it affecrs the vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:29:06 Oh and
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:29:28 The hover engines motors stubs are the ones that break, they spin away from the build
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:29:55 True
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:05 Wait.
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:13 Could a conveyor drive work?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:20 For especially large turrets
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:25 Like naval
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:35 If it does
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:30:55 Then youd have just made the most stupidly fast missile cannon
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:31:09 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:32:38 Just try not to induce spinbreech detonation
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:32:56 Or else you're screwed
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:33:28 Shouldn't be a problem on fast aircraft though
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:33:37 Even kf they misfire
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:33:49 Cus of, yet again
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:33:54 Server latency

help 2023-01-21 23:46:44 I did it, just used a pixel art thing, thats why i said its out of proportion

right, PCC is a very elitist server, with some very high expectations - its why people with ranks are so hostile to "whitenames" (well, most whitenames, anyways.)

creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:16:05 How to get Pixel artist role Step-by-step tutorial
1) find high quality image of what you want to do
2) open photo editing software, pixelate until it fits the size of the pc plot or lower (50 pixels across maximum) 
3) copy each individual pixel
4) profit <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Hidden 5th step) use script <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-01-24 21:19:16 I mean thats about, 2500 individual pixels for a full 50x50 canvas
So taking into consideration the fact you have to colour pick each pixel, thats about 10-20 seconds

Might be the shaders, people are very love/hate with shaders, especially ones that make everything look like the monsoon season

bot-central 2023-01-25 00:28:30 So you use it for "status" and the others actually mean something (mostly)
general 2023-01-25 00:29:24 What was the first thing i said, on this server
general 2023-01-25 00:32:00 we're basically in the 40k era of pcc

Good, it actually feels like too much stuff has been added for such a small chassis. Apart from that, should be good to paint
general 2023-01-25 00:59:55 Anyone know any half decent casual pc discord servers?
general 2023-01-25 01:00:21 Its nice here, but I've got bugger all else to talk to when im talking about PC

plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:25:19 Lemme find some images of it
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:30:25 Old photos before i swapped out of prototype scheme and added the 75mm

plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:31:36 Deleted it soon after i took the photos
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:31:59 Just didnt like having the fact its the result of a bet on my mind
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:32:10 Didn't feel like my own build
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:33:28 It wasnt even that bad of a plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 13:33:52 Its just its essentially a rebuilt tutorial, because of the specification of the bet

I mean thats more a blessing and a curse, you'll build shit fast, but you'll also get burnout fast aswell

(You aren't)
help 2023-02-10 00:56:55 If its dumb munitions, like bombs, then no

If its a guided munition, like a custom missile, i *think* you can use suspension behind the warhead to absorb and delay the impact for enough time for the tnt to detonate
help 2023-02-10 00:58:12 Can't remember if thats the case though.

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:38 Even the fucking helicopters
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:49:48 Probably

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:03 Motor 2 fold users
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:28 Planecrazy became a no fly zone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:51:43 Except for the people who use control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:52:10 i cackle with glee at this new event
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:52:21 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:00 Actually could have the benefit of people learning how to actually dogfight
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:53:12 Instead of pulling 200g turns every second
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:10 99.99% of all namnam tut plebs also use M2M soooo <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:35 Oh what a shame
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:39 I feel so sorry
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:54:42 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:55:09 Sorry if im acting a BIT smug about this
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:55:18 Seeming i wont be affected in the slightest
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:55:57 Yes, i stack the shit out of ones that are on toggle
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:06 I do planes and helis mostly
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:27 Kikka that rivals M2M jets, yet uses control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:56:50 I mean
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:57:30 I just looked here to ask if someone knew how to make a roof panel that can lift up a bit so the gunbreech can depress
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 22:57:54 (Gunbreech is a spinbreech, so that complicates it)
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:00:49 Weapon technique
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:00:57 Utilising legacy missiles
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:01:10 Yeah my carrier is fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:01:15 But i can literally just
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:01:19 Swap 5 motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:01:22 And itll be fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:01:42 Addio
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:02:47 ITS THE AGE OF APOSTASY FOLKS
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:02:51 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:03:06 Right
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:03:16 So whos the Goge Vandire of pcc
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:03:39 Well
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:03:47 Do you remember how
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:01 Motor 2s used to not spasm with high amounts of weight
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:07 Back in like, 2020
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:13 Yeah thats still not fixed
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:14 So
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:16 Forever
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:19 Ill presume
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:35 Unless it actually gets tackled
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:38 Hell
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:04:51 Rickje might even do what he did with the text glitch
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:05:00 And say theres literally no way to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:05:30 Just stack sets of them in a lock tower, and edit the controls to WASD
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:05:54 Ive always done that, feels more realistic in terms of flight
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:06:16 Wait
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:06:18 Shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:06:23 My old gunship wont work
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:07:42 I mean this flies only with control surfaces sooo
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:07:44 And it matches M2M aircraft in handling (if i remove the intentional ballast to limit handling, that is)
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:08:39 Its probably the fact that its got the centre of mass in a area that allows for more sensitive handling though
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:08:47 Due to how weirdly built it is
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:09:12 Pulse Jet floatplane lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:09:25 Its called having creativity <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:09:55 Though that one is from 2021, and im remaking it
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:10:03 The m2 panels?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:11:25 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:11:52 Control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:11:58 Oh right
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:12:01 So basically

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:23 What about
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:16:28 Propellor blade helis
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:05 Yeah im fine then
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:17:16 Swashplate uses locked motor 1s

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:13 Basically
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:27 Peoples counter to the pvp scum tactics is gone
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:36 Aswell as the pvp scum tactics
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:33:55 So basically everyone is at a equal footing, mostly
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:07 Unless they mastered using preset panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:09 Like i dod
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:18 In that case
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:34 Its duck hunting time
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:34:38 They are
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:35:14 Same

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:36:29 Doesnt bother me
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:37:56 *most likely has either russian camo or solo wing pixy camo
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:38:59 Its the PCC rapture
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:39:16 The wicked m2 users shall suffer greatly <:trollface:775024642104229898>

bug-reports 2023-03-15 23:43:19 The glorious final hours of motor 2 aircraft has come <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:20 Sorta
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:33 Nope
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:46:48 Literally just preset panels toggled to WASD
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:08 Yeah, alongside non toggled presets
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:14 So i also have mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:27 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:35 Like gun runs or gentle turns
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:47:56 ah
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:48:04 Yeah, my reccomendation is
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:48:20 Stack a shitton of WASD toggled presets
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:48:25 In a motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:48:57 And to prevent cheese grater wings, lock a normal wing panel in the shape of the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:49:16 Only downside is when you use the panels they reveal themselves
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:49:39 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:49:59 You can use whatever to hide the surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:13 I just use either disconnectors or wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:45 Rip
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:50:58 Can't rn, sorry
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:01 I wouldve sent
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:06 Pictures of my Kikka
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:10 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:15 Thats on my laptop
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:56 I can help tommorow if needs be
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:51:58 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:52:04 Thats too long, isnt it?
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:52:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:53:14 I'll be on at around 4:30-4:50pm UK time, so its fine if thats too long of a wait
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:54:39 Eh
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:54:45 Wouldnt say that
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:54:47 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:54:59 The majority of all plane users
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:55:08 Are gonna have to adapt
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:55:25 Fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:55:38 They use multi-angle wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:55:44 So theyre EXTRA fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:12 Unless you already adapted years prior <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:37 Yeah, my designs will be fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:54 Coaxial rotors that only use.motor 1s
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:56:59 And propellor blades
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:57:44 I mean
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:03 The ONE build that might be affected for me
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:13 Is my ancient duorotor
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:25 Motor 2s have broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:28 Entirely
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:40 All m2 planes are dead in the water
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:58:53 So, like
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:59:02 90% of all planes are dead
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:00:16 For me its 3 motor 1s, 1 set to AD, the others set to JR
Rotors themselves are made out of signs, then maybe 1 or 2 prop blades
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:00:41 Chromium
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:00:44 <:empty:794431705070174238>

plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:03:50 Addio
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:09:11 And bugs are even more pathetic
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:09:26 Also, at what sorta speeds do the panels break?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:12:20 Dont
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:12:32 That always never works as intended
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:14:58 It aint but okay-
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:22 Idk
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:26 Im just here
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:15:36 Sipping the tears of pvp jet users
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:21 That doesnt mean shit
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:46 The games hardcoded, which makes it a MASSIVE pain in the ass to fix minor issues
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:59 Its why other bugs like, say, the text bug
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:04 Are still here
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:06 Yeaj
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:23 Pc1 has been basically slowly decaying
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:28 For years now
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:43 Its essentially on the golden throne of roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:54 Like alot of other games
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:27 So
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:30 In other words
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:38 This aint going away
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:42 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:49 All the m2m users are fucked
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:19:52 Which is fine

plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:20:35 Same here
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:20:42 Motorlock em and set em to WASD
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:20:58 m2m performance, less buggy, and looks better
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:21:39 If you lock like
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:21:50 Shittons of control panels
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:21:53 All for WASD
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:22:04 You essentially get cheap M2M
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:22:07 Depending on the weight distribution
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:22:15 You can actually surpass M2M

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:55:14 Wow you finally figured it oit
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:55:24 Its been stagnating for years now
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:55:42 Same here

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:57:19 Tbf i never really pay attention to the stagnant nature of pc1
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:57:36 Mainly due to the majority of my friends being on very often
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:57:42 Same
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:58:01 But if i cant cope i just use my  Banshee and im all fine
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:58:36 scuffed aircraft i made in 2021
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:58:45 Not the US Banshee jet
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:59:06 mfw 40 hovers
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:59:10 And a conv drive
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:59:29 (Only has that much hovers due to how shit it is aerodynamics wise(
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 12:59:40 Yeah, i use it to annoy bugs and pvp jets
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:08 Plus you can essentially get invincibility frames, in a way, when you use it for a brief moment
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:16 Against missiles and fireworks
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:22 Eh
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:28 Armour can work
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:30 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:00:39 Your tank would look scuffed for it to work
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:01:12 Ladders can be used as cope cages, but need to be like 3 blocks away
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:01:39 TNT armour also needs to be about 3 blocks away from other important parts, because missiles do AOE damahe
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:13 Tnt armour is useless against explosives unless its spaced away from important parts
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:30 It doesnt destroy the block
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:31 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:38 The parts behind it
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:02:52 Cus bullets occasionally just overpen for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:03:41 Tbf armour is really gimmicky, unless you space it far apart
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:03:49 So the best bet is to either
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:03:51 Be really fast
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:03:59 Or snipe
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:04:09 I usually do sniping and speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:04:27 Cross map missile shots go brr
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:04:40 Server delay
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:04:51 Fucks so much up in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:05:16 Its why i just rely on using sheer gun velocity in my rounds
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:05:53 Yet again
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:06:09 Why would you die from close range combat
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:06:18 When you can just snipe from across the entire map
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:06:24 With missiles
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:06:39 You use a spinbreech?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:06:59 Custom or preset
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:07:25 Ah right
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:07:36 I mean i cross map with spinbreech
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:07:42 So i can use the missile block
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:07:50 And still do cross map shots
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:08:43 But why click multiple buttons
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:08:50 When you can just press F
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:07 So you dont guide it?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:11 I dont need to guide
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:16 I aim
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:17 Fire
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:21 Wow look
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:27 Missile block is doing 2k sps
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:40 Target is wiped from existence
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:09:56 Tedious
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:10:01 Also has limited rounds
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:10:47 Only downside of a spinbreech is that they can work fine in the vertical plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:10:54 But unless your turret is heavy
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:11:02 You cant do horizon

plane-crazy 2023-03-26 00:28:17 Even when ricks online, hes just playing Genshit lmao
general 2023-03-26 00:28:59 I do not believe i myself as a worthy member of the table.
general 2023-03-26 00:29:36 I am but a lowly disciple, like many of us who follow you Joman, blessed be your name.
general 2023-03-26 00:31:06 I am a good builder, and i am knowledgeable in military tactics. However, i fear that the technology i use bars me from truly harnessing the potential i could give to your cause, Joman
general 2023-03-26 00:31:22 I exist
general 2023-03-26 00:31:55 I havent posted in over a year or so aswell, so my designs are out of date in this server
general 2023-03-26 00:32:28 If a 6k+ Sps design with high modularity works, then yes.
general 2023-03-26 00:32:38 But, as i have mentioned before.
general 2023-03-26 00:32:45 Do not consider me for a member.
general 2023-03-26 00:33:25 I believe many other options, all finer than i, are already available to join the table
general 2023-03-26 00:34:19 I refrain from that abhorrent term, 1-wide. The smallest of my manned designs were 2 blocks wide.
general 2023-03-26 00:34:51 That is why i don't consider myself a suitable choice for the table.
general 2023-03-26 00:35:37 Simple answer, without the mannerisms
general 2023-03-26 00:35:39 No
general 2023-03-26 00:36:08 I cannot, for i am not able to access the images of said creations
general 2023-03-26 00:36:47 I will take a stand in this matter, and say i personally don't believe i should ascend to the rankings of the table
general 2023-03-26 00:37:12 I defy you in this matter, my lord.
general 2023-03-26 00:37:29 As I have already stated.
general 2023-03-26 00:38:01 I do believe I *could* be a member, but not the best option, by a long shot
general 2023-03-26 00:38:23 Do not defy his word.
general 2023-03-26 00:41:45 I am most gracious, Joman, blessed be your name.
general 2023-03-26 00:41:51 Amen.
general 2023-03-26 00:43:10 I wish you luck in this challenge. I will not be of anger if you are to succeed.
general 2023-03-26 00:43:25 Amen.
general 2023-03-26 00:44:20 Joman, blessed be your name, I have a question that i may ask of you.
general 2023-03-26 00:45:13 Why do you consider me as a potential member for the Table?
I have but spoken to you in only this moment, and even showed defiancy.
general 2023-03-26 00:45:24 So why am i still considered?
general 2023-03-26 00:47:38 Blessed be this day.
general 2023-03-26 00:48:29 We shall spread this truth to all, Joman, blessed be your name

creations-chat 2023-04-04 14:18:42 if its about the downvote, there i absolutely nothing wrong with the build.
infact, i think the build itself is great.
just the colour looks a bit off.

the-dump 2023-04-04 15:01:02 ohno
help 2023-04-04 15:03:14 i mean, its definitely the best option overall in terms of capability
help 2023-04-04 15:03:54 but, seeming i can no longer make the large superstructure design i initially wanted to do, i'll probably want to try embrace the "early dreadnought" look

general 2023-04-15 15:16:38 It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.

Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants - and worse.

To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.
