creations-chat 2022-11-20 04:30:21 or maybe roblox's regular shading is meant for little kids with outdated computers
which makes pretty much every build look off one way or the other
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:09:13 me when the f-35a and the f-16 both have a limit of 9gs
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:13:33 ima be frankly honest all of that is classified and we dont really know jack shit about the f-35 or su-57
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:18:13 the f-35 (depending on variant) does about 4-5 sustained gs but to be fair you really dont wanna go too high in Gs anyways cause the speed bleeds way too much
<@610990270846074880> the f-35 is more maneuverable than the f-16 at higher combat loads cause its all stored internally=less drag
also higher AOA limit for the f-35 aswell so remember that too

creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:41:22 china vs having original designs (impossible)
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:45:14 they totally didnt steal classified f-35 documents to use on their own aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:48:27 also that one time they shamelessly copied the sensor system (while stealth limits designs very much there is a good amount of things that just get blatantly stolen)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:34:51 the engines on the b-52 are pretty wonky
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:47:42 back of the canopy should go into the vstab also the wing should have a little bit of dihedral
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:48:03 also you forgot these things on the top of the angled parts
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:48:53 just piston lock a wing panel there
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 05:48:54 or something
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:41:08 intakes are tiny, wings dont sweep, no full moving elevator, exposed lock, canopy makes up 50% of the length, also if it were mini it shouldnt have a 2 wide nose and alot more
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:45:58 see how the intakes squares and not circular and the wings are higher up than the elevators
creations-chat 2022-12-18 03:53:59 a beter idea would be to use piston lock so you dont have to have the delta wings

creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:45:14 too bad most things that do well in pvp look like dogshit, plane crazy is pretty much about making the most realistic shit you can with the VERY limited resources given at this point
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:47:59 pvp is a dying gamemode tbh, its just cancer to play cause every plane has the turn rate of an ace combat mig-29 on steroids
i can be glad plane crazy introduced me into learning shit about aviation cause if it hadnt i would have never downloaded dcs

creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:35:07 ive changed my mind, your f-15 should be a 4 wide
creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:37:24 you have my respect for doing the math, i change my mind, <@862160384206962749> do it, it would be funny i think (you could probably make a pretty cool detailed cockpit
creations-chat 2023-01-19 18:20:02 f-15 intakes that do the thing f-15 intakes do

plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:42:29 u should angle lock it instead of using half wedges, it makes it more original
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:46:11 oh and also make a wing panel cone
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:46:12 i dare you
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:46:33 they're actually pretty easy

plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:48:32 that thing was poorly planned
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:48:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:48:54 my b-1 needs bigger plot size
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:49:45 if it doesnt that would suck

creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:07:08 <@842474302585831474> proportions=correct, scale=like 1/3rd bigger than it should but its fine
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:10:01 imo it looks big enough in game to be acceptable
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:13:26 now all i have to do is add engines and the elevators which is gonna suck cause im running out of space and the engines are gonna be locked
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:23:04 man i also dont have enough sparklers available to make the engine designs i wanted to üò≠

creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:40:50 the hard part is getting the engines to align correctly because issues, the design still isnt done cause i gotta add the scoop under the thingy
creations-chat 2023-01-27 08:54:57 yeah, but the wingspan was about 150 blocks long and it took like 4 hours
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:00:48 just motor lock an extra delta wing on like this

creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:03:25 canoopy <@807636089107251211> yes this remake is looking 100%  better, the old one didnt have any wire and didnt have the other canopy detail
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:07:04 u should try an fw190, havent seen alot of those
creations-chat 2023-01-28 20:09:56 also finally got the nose gear to go all the way into the fuselage

creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:29:41 paint scheme for now, idk if im gonna do locked camo or not. either way looks better, flies better, and reliably loads in laggy servers unlike the original
creations-chat 2023-01-29 06:18:22 cause it conflicts with the angle lock i cant do much about it, <@495210490172014612> if u can find a better nose design i will 100% do it

creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:06:35 something dont seem right about this
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:31:20 corsair didnt turn out how i wanted it to so im scrapping it for fw190 dora nine
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:35:42 it is NOT the most detailed shit, theres other people 100% worth that title lol. i usually dum down my builds cause i want them to actually load in anything but an empty private server
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:40:31 only thing i got goin for me is that i build fast, thats about it
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:43:09 i dont usually count but i made my 262 in like maybe 5-6 hours
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:46:07 either way i usually get all the structual stuff for builds done in less than one day, for painting im just lazy lol. <@695737395961659464> go to a museum for aircraft or something then build it in the game, thats what i did once and it worked pretty well
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:48:30 if thats how it is i dont really got any tips, it just kinda  happens for me and then i take like a 2 month break
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:53:19 it isnt bad, its just kinda average like 99% of everybody here, thats just kinda how it is though and going from average to pro is something that takes alot of dedication. i consider my stuff pretty average since its simple asf
creations-chat 2023-01-30 22:57:07 tbf i thought about how to build all this stuff during my burnout so ive kinda got an advantage, also the 262 im actually proud of is a remake of the one i did a day before
just keep trying with it, ive had like 2 builds fail today. my corsair and another fw190 that i started on
creations-chat 2023-01-30 23:16:46 dont worry bout it, at least the 229 got into creations

creations-chat 2023-02-01 05:58:46 nvm this image just gave me my answer, round wedge out angle locked just like every single one of my other builds hurray
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:02:11 this wing is gonna be so easy cause one angle lock, thank you douglas aircraft company for your plane crazy friendly design
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:31:45 shhh i dont wanna think about that right now. ive got the nose shape done but now i just need to angle lock everything to fill it in <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-02-01 07:34:17 so jagged üò≠
creations-chat 2023-02-01 07:45:16 sorta kinda fixed the nose jaggedness problem and lowered canopy thingy down a lil. ill get to the top half later as im mainly trying to get the whole nose done

creations-chat 2023-02-01 09:10:10 le nose is mostly complete only needs smoothing
creations-chat 2023-02-01 17:43:59 late reply but basically it allows the thing to angle lock correctly

creations-chat 2023-02-04 00:33:46 next episode on growling sidewinder
creations-chat 2023-02-04 00:38:48 im confused what tf happened to the canopy though
creations-chat 2023-02-04 01:55:24 average shitty f-14 builders when feedback ü§Ø
creations-chat 2023-02-04 02:01:27 elevators in the wrong place + too small, wing sweep could use the hinge being more inward + piston lock and probably shouldnt be a half block thick because that makes it ugly asf, canopy is too short and the vstabs shouldnt be 1x2, they should be 1x1. theres alot more to overall improve but this is just a start

<@773474989751664640> i wrote that all out just before lol
help 2023-02-04 05:11:36 is it like a custom carrier or is it a specific one

creations-chat 2023-02-04 05:21:41 su-57 < mig 1.44
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:27:22 unless you REALLY want it for the looks i wouldnt try it because 9 times out of 10 it doesnt end up looking good plus it doesnt work too well, unless you are the 1 in 10 that can implement it properly and make it work while still looking good i wouldnt reccomend it
creations-chat 2023-02-04 05:29:09 that looks like a pretty simple build, ill try it. something else i want to attempt at some point would be an a-6
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:30:11 yes and no depending on how powerful that engine is
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:30:15 alr so
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:30:26 the way thrust vectoring actually works cant be done on pc
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 05:30:46 so theres compromises

plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:39:17 ooouh you want to grind your life away ouuuh
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:40:59 su-33 comes with super carrier
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:41:02 very good buy
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:41:35 yeah i discovered that when i bought it
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:41:36 i had no clue
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 21:41:41 it just appeared
help 2023-02-08 04:10:16 ur using locked motors at high speeds to control the pitch of the blades it looks like
help 2023-02-08 04:10:23 locked motors dont like to move fast like that
help 2023-02-08 04:10:25 so they glitch out
help 2023-02-08 04:11:05 u need to set the pitch of the blades before take off and not adjust them at all until blades are stationary, control the collective by rotor rpm
help 2023-02-08 04:12:42 oh wait ur using motor 2s
help 2023-02-08 04:12:43 bad idea
help 2023-02-08 04:41:55 wdym
help 2023-02-08 04:42:00 i can see the pitch of the blades changing
help 2023-02-08 04:42:43 oh and also the blades should be longer
help 2023-02-08 04:52:08 simply motor lock the front one down by a half block
general 2023-02-08 06:14:26 im gonna speedrun this f-18c faster than you can complete your wings üßê
general 2023-02-08 06:15:30 the bullying
general 2023-02-08 06:15:31 i cant take it
general 2023-02-08 06:17:17 nahhh
general 2023-02-08 06:17:23 ive got something in mind
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:57:57 the wing sweep point is further in, i think it could fix it.
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 19:59:10 do that and also remember that the pivot point is further in
general 2023-02-08 20:38:22 it is a square because
general 2023-02-08 20:38:24 i said so
general 2023-02-08 20:38:27 üßê
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 23:38:51 my reaction when they choose a picture that already has a marking on it (done propery)
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 23:39:25 that picture was taken years ago as its the oldest f-22 in service
plane-crazy 2023-02-09 23:39:36 balloon was photoshopped on there
general 2023-02-10 01:39:42 variable intakes ü§Ø too bad the rest of this plane is kinda ass and i never finished it
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:12:28 f-22 radar absorbent outer layer loves to deteriorate while on the f-35 its built into the skin instead of being a layer
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:12:58 which also means the fasteners with the radar absorbant layer also loves to deteriorate
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:13:07 so it looks alot worse
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:13:28 (people should realize all fighters have fasteners and its not just a su-57 thing)
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:15:11 if you're thinking of this picture, this was an early prototype
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:15:30 su-57 isnt automatically awful just because its russian
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:16:37 either way doesnt matter how good or bad an aircraft is
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:16:43 what matters is how many of them there is
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:18:22 i think its nearing 1000 f-35s
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:19:46 su-57 hasnt reached anywhere near its peak yet so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:19:55 its the long run that counts
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:20:36 
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:20:47 f-35 fasteners
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:21:11 .1m
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:21:15 already knew that
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:21:36 f-35 is the f-16 of the stealth fighters
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:22:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:22:53 su-57 isnt meant to be a record breaker
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:23:31 imo its still gonna turn out as a formidable fighter
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:24:27 russia's economy is bust
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:24:51 i think sukhoi paid out of pocket
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:24:54 for the development
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:24:56 not sure though
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:25:03 i remember reading that somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:25:19 thats why the mig 1.44 was cut short
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:25:35 lost funding from the government and mikoyan couldnt pay for it themselves
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:26:30 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:27:06 mb
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:27:09 got it confused
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:27:25 i remember some russian company paid out of pocket for a stealth fighter
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:27:32 idr which one though
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:31:13 oh yeah ive seen that photo before
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:31:29 already stole the little f-35 thingy lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:31:32 just like china
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:32:47 j-20 looks very ugly imo
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:34:34 6th generation next
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:34:43 we'll see what that entails
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:35:07 even though they're all pancakes that look more or less the same
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:35:28 
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:36:51 chinese concept
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:37:04 in other words visual identification pretty much wont work
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:37:14 its gonna be like migs and sabres all over again
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:38:59 assuming improved avionics stealth supercruise blabla
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:39:07 just like every other generation
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:40:51 i think energy weapons are a thing too
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:40:56 for 6th gen
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:41:00 just like ace combat!!!!
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:41:30 also the loyal wingman drones
plane-crazy 2023-02-10 04:41:31 those too
creations-chat 2023-02-12 22:42:54 
creations-chat 2023-02-13 02:07:09 me when simulated dogfight where the f-22 is forced to carry full bags and not allowed to jettison them
creations-chat 2023-02-16 07:37:13 you can fit custom engines in there no problem
creations-chat 2023-02-16 07:39:15 for my b-29 i had to do whatever tf this is for custom engines so i think you are able to put them in there (i did not plan ahead)
creations-chat 2023-02-16 07:43:29 custom cowling+custom props looks alot better

general 2023-02-21 23:12:42 growling sidewinder 4 f-18 vs 1 a-10 (realistic)
general 2023-02-21 23:14:49 me when i make the same video within a 3 week time period
general 2023-02-21 23:15:16 also the vsn f-4 mod has an abysmal flight model

general 2023-02-21 23:16:11 only the most action packed content
creations-chat 2023-02-22 01:11:22 next time try using an angle locked nose, also your missiles are goofy looking cause they're too small. imo the wings are a little big aswell. theres alot that could be improved other than what i listed but that just comes with time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:19:45 windows 11>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:23:12 what is the reason for your hatred
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:23:27 in what way üò≠
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:23:45 its windows 10 but the task bar is different
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:24:14 i like it this way anyway
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:26:35 my task bar is bigger<:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:27:19 1440p 27 inches i think
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:27:31 yes ik why
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:00 it is literally exactly the same
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:22 idk man
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:28 i havent felt it being slower
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:33 also that 200gb thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:36 havent noticed that either
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:30:30 now that i can agree with
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:31:00 windows installation only takes up 26 gb
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:31:54 dcs on the other hand <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:09 i bought a gaming laptop for school too
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:10 bad idea
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:16 battery life sucks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:29 battery literally inflates like a pillow after 2 years of use
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:50 i just use normal laptop for school
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:35:01 running dcs is ez as long as its not vr
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:35:09 vr is an entirely different beast
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:35:46 1 obscure setting can be the difference between smooth 90fps or 5fps
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:37:57 i somehow traded a razer rtx 2060 laptop for a 3060 ti mini itx 32gb ryzen 5 5600x desktop
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:37:59 dont ask me how
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:38:44 razer blade 15 2020
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:38:49 nothing special
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:39:36 3050 so mid
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:41:46 what do you have atm
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:42:41 used 3080 ti and ryzen 9 5800x3d is the best rig for dcs atm without breaking the bank
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:42:56 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:43:01 i need the growling sidewinder pc
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:43:05 with 8gb of ram
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:18 best dcs pc
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:31 and the ram
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:39 and the ssd
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:41 no
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:44 32gb for multiplayer
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:45 is like
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:45:50 so much better
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:46:00 the sidewinder is actually ass bro dont buy it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:46:53 more like aim-9m
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:47:44 thats so bad
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:47:53 you could get so much better for that price
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:48:40 not gonna leak my location but on facebook marketplace
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:48:41 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:48:50 500 dollar gpu
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:49:02 that will be future proof
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:52:19 yes its simply that easy
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:53:27 thats a vr rig right there
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:55:29 my reaction when the worse computer literally costs twice as much
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:00:41 fr i spent like less than 1 minute making that 1.8k list
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:01:12 with enough effort put in and stalking facebook marketplace you could probably get it under 1.3k
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:01:38 its different when you play dcs vr
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:01:43 trust
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:02:00 i always do used

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:23:30 i dont understand
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:33:50 pcpartpicker
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:51:06 nope
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:51:24 thats acually the money from the atm i stole
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 02:55:54 me when i spend thousands of dollars on real vintage flight instruments just to shove an arduino inside of them then put them into a sim pit
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 03:02:13 https://www.youtube.com/@thewarthogproject/videos
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 03:02:25 very cool but
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 03:02:28 very expensive
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:54:09 looks like an fw190 d-9
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:54:35 
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:55:47 could be much better
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:55:50 frankly
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:56:01 i messed up on the angle lock for the tail
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:56:18 also i forgot to do canopy details
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:56:41 either way its fine could be better
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:11 yeah that bf-109 is what made me think about doing the angle locked tail
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:16 also ive seen the lock in game
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:21 you overlocked that thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:22 so much
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:48 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 00:58:49 you did
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:00:48 honestly i think that i could make my lock alot smaller if i tried again
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:01:00 gl copying!!
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:01:27 send
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:02:13 this is probably the most compressed motorlock ive ever done
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:04:00 most generic f-16 ever built ü§Ø
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:04:13 ive seen like 5 of these
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:04:22 that look nearly exactly the same
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:04:44 yeah i just wanted to test how compressed i can make the lock
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:05:09 im never posting it into creations cause it would be considered a copy
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:05:59 i think so
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:07:33 i really wanna finish this but im too lazy smh
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:09:55 oh that kind of nose is easy
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:10:12 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:15:32 anyways im pretty sure the part that goes into the nose cone are jet engines
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:16:01 yeah doesnt sound that hard to do
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:16:13 nahhh
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:18:16 half cylinder 2 locked into a half block
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:18:24 simply that easy
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:18:48 also pistons havent been lag multipliers for me
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:18:58 just too lucky
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:19:45 simply uhh angle lock trails to make a perfectly round nose cone
plane-crazy 2023-02-24 01:21:37 bet üßê

plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:02:21 things to fix
spine merge from canopy
ailerons
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:02:36 also under perfect piston lock
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:02:40 the canopy is seamless
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:02:53 too bad that like
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:02:55 neverh appens
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:03:10 vstabs arent angled
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:03:14 i have sinned
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:03:24 also shaders
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:10 
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:13 sweep!
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:17 all 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:47 canopy doesnt do the thingy
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:48 but
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:05:49 its fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:00 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:03 super sad
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:05 i wanted it to
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:10 but i couldnt find a design that worked
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:42 i was thinking about that
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:48 so
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:48 havent used magnet lock before
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:56 i might modify it at a later date
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:06:58 cause there is room
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:07:03 i just didnt awnt to magnet lock
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:08:21 i should also do custom tail pipes
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:08:22 but
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:08:24 im lazy rn
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:09:01 i started at 4 pm yesterday
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:09:26 this is probably the reason i get builds done so fast
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:09:36 literal sleepless nights
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:09:50 plane crazy has ruined my sleep schedule like
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 15:09:52 5 times now

plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:40:03 actually
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:40:05 suprisingly
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:40:13 60 fps solid
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:40:19 turns nicely
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:40:24 roll rate could be better
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:46:42 frankly for a 3k block build i think it turned out nicely with handling
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:49:01 one thing though
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:49:06 it seems to kill other people's games
plane-crazy 2023-02-25 16:49:07 so

general 2023-02-26 03:33:32 and literally refuses to lock/piston the next
general 2023-02-26 03:46:00 jesus christ please

bug-reports 2023-02-26 03:54:14 ur pistons are shitty and these arent read because plane crazy will never update again
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:32:31 my f-14 completely died
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:32:37 piston lock doesnt work no more
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:32:59 i have to wait for PC2
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:33:01 just like
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:33:03 3 other builds
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:33:04 that i have

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:01 full potential
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:04 will be unlocked
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:22 we're only using like 3% of the plane crazy brain
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:35 once pistons dont die
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:40 and locked motors work properly
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:34:50 builds will be more realistic than ever
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:36:08 joy to key + mouse controls
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:36:10 boom
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:36:12 joystick
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:36:17 i think that would work
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:36:19 only a theory
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:13 i think it would
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:15 ill test that
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:38:16 some dya
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:42:19 nah its a different type of mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:42:28 it reverts back to the middle
general 2023-02-26 05:00:14 the us air force should invest into a piston engine powered 80mm gun with 15g tolerance
general 2023-02-26 05:00:51 lazers are obviously unproven and unreliable
general 2023-02-26 05:01:19 also should have no missile compatibility
general 2023-02-26 05:01:29 because they are unproven and unreliable
general 2023-02-26 05:02:32 euu have you ever watched pentagon wars young man

general 2023-02-26 05:05:09 ths the supreme engine placement for aerodynamics
general 2023-02-26 05:06:13 why locked motor not move and piston die üò° my gamer rage is increasing
general 2023-02-26 05:07:13 it WAS an f-14 until roblox decided to give me 2 billion ping every time i spawn
general 2023-02-26 05:07:37 i miss my tomcat
general 2023-02-26 05:08:05 shaders
general 2023-02-26 05:08:06 idk
general 2023-02-26 05:08:11 i dont have any pics of it without shaders
general 2023-02-26 05:08:13 i would send one
general 2023-02-26 05:08:18 but it literally doesnt spawn
general 2023-02-26 05:08:19 so
general 2023-02-26 05:08:30 even in an empty private server
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:54:06 i use a mix of springs and disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:54:27 works very well if you set off the springs before you set off the disconnectors cause they dont get caught in the build

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:34:27 so close
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:34:32 ive got an idea though
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:36:31 ty f-14 designers for putting the gear retraction right infront of the pivot
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:37:12 nearly perfect
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:48:06 probably just the angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:48:22 never actually measured it so its probably off a few blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:48:30 i just kinda assume
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:49:31 fr
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:51:37 ooh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:51:39 it is a little tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:51:47 about a half block though
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:09 wait
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:18 nvm its just the angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:29 oh
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:30 im stupid
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:32 yeah it is
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:35 a little high
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:37 ill fix that later
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:52:48 ez fix
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:53:49 i always kinda felt something was wrong with the cnaopy area
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:53:54 canopy*
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:53:58 guess i know now
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:54:26 i got it fully inside!
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:54:30 yipee
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:55:17 whats piston to block again
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:55:26 1 is a half block right
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 11:55:27 i think
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:43:53 honestly i kinda liked it more before
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:45:25 or i could have always just
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:45:29 brought up the intakes a little bit
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:45:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:45:31 i think its that
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:45:32 its that
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:46:02 ill just stick with the taller version
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:48:35 looking at this i think its accurate enough
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:50:57 send pics
general 2023-02-26 13:01:16 me when a triple a game can be made in the time pc2 has been in "development"
general 2023-02-26 13:02:21 uhh yeah maybe chizzled is the better comparison
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:04:38 also gear is too far back
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:04:40 cause
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:04:40 but i cant fix
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:04:50 angle lock is in the place where it would be
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:05:05 which sucks

creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:06:40 options options, livery rn is just a test so the colors suck
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:09:26 idk im not really able to do that type of nose paint due to how i built it

also i might just revise the whole thing like what i did with my 262, only cause theres alot of lock thats unnecessary and driving up the lag. also the canopy isn't the right shape. also the intakes are a little messy and hard to work with because

creations-chat 2023-03-04 11:37:45 my wip f-14 that im considering restarting on has like 20 pistons already

yeah, honestly i think im just gonna wait til pc2 to start on another one so i can go all out and use like 60+ pistons without killing my game
creations-chat 2023-03-04 11:53:44 i put in the engines last (i also built this in like 18 hours overnight so i was tired asf) no
anyways the engines couldnt fit the way they should have so i had to individually motorlock them into the right position, which made a mess

creations-chat 2023-03-04 12:03:48 another 1 wide f-16 to add to the collection (they all look the same and im guilty aswell

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:03:08 thank jesus the germans lost
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:03:12 these aircraft are ugly asf
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:05:39 this is why you dont give extra food rations to any "aircraft designer"  who can think of a design that can be funded
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:51:26 FINISH IT
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:51:35 ive seen your f-5 every 5 seconds

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:53:46 also blueprints arent good for comparing
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:53:48 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:53:51 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:16 theres this very cool thing called perspective
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:26 and it completely changes how images look
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:33 in other words
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:46 your f-5 be goofy asf proportions wise probably
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:56:14 heres a better image to cmpare with
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:56:39 "this german concept would have won ww2"
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:56:53 "if this was put into production we would all be speaking german"
creations-chat 2023-04-29 16:59:27 me when i dont play plane crazy for like 2 months and my f-14 no longer can spawn üßê
creations-chat 2023-04-29 17:02:47 someone please explain why no worky anymore
creations-chat 2023-04-29 17:09:29 wow awesome!!! anyways yeah i get a bajillion ping and everything stops working, i think that build was like 3k or 4k i forgor
creations-chat 2023-04-29 17:14:20 my b-29 will never be spawned again üò≠
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:39:52 how have you spend 14 hours on that young man
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:42:35 i expect your tomcat to be finished in 14 hours, this took me less than 12 ü•±  too bad i cant spawn it anymore
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:45:57 i would remake it with a shorter fuselage here along with better intakes cause they are kinda ü§¢ also find a way to get half block thick wings
forgot to mention, i wouldnt use nearly as much piston lock aswell
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:48:21 yeah this part right here is way too flat and needs an extra angle lock to round it out a little bit
the reason the nose is weird is cause it kinda expands out in a weird way so it makes it a little odd from other povs
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:52:25 honestly i dont really wanna make another tomcat, f-4e sounds like a much more fun build but i'm afraid it would look very similar to srs
frankly you cant get much better than sr's f-4 lol
creations-chat 2023-04-29 21:56:04 also i dont put like 70% of my day into pc anymore so yeah lol, it would take forever to finish since i have actual hobbies now (insane)
<@456226577798135808> weird nose that i dont feel like doing tbh f-20>
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:41:07 its quite round young man
yes because the super hornet has a totally different nosecone (its exactly the same)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:43:51 also if you care about realism just dont play plane crazy lol
if you care that much about one angle on the nose idk what to tell you
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:46:51 also i just looked at your original build and you have ALOT more to worry about than just the nose
please discover half blocks please
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:49:33 the nose also isnt 3 blocks wide
make it 2 blocks wide and your fuel tanks are goofy asf
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:51:39 looks 2 blocks wide to me
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:54:48 what are you babbling about, sticknubs f-18 looks fine and its 2 blocks wide
dont use blueprints, they are very misleading because of perspective
creations-chat 2023-04-30 00:58:35 that 3d model innacurate asf just use this legacy hornet model+ irl pictures of a super hornet https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/fa-18-bd-hornet-ec3b72e281b3478199775a0e96368943
i said use this LEGACY HORNET model and just change the inaccuracies with real images of a super hornet
creations-chat 2023-04-30 01:01:30 there arent many good super hornet models so use a legacy hornet model+images of super hornet its that shrimple
general 2023-04-30 01:24:03 formation goes hard üßê
general 2023-04-30 01:24:53 im going to suppress your air defenses ü•±

plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:14:13 also the f-4x would have been faster than the mig-25 ü•±
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:15:20 fatass üßê
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:16:09 me when my program goes hilariously over budget
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:17:48 me personally
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:17:53 i dont have anything against the f-35
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:17:58 but comparing it to a 3rd gen
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:19:08 cant kill a squadron of su-57s
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:19:15 if there isnt enough for a squadron
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:20:08 either way the super hornet is more of a 4.5 gen aircraft anyway
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:20:19 top gun was underestimating the hornet
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:21:42 yes that plane exists
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 14:21:52 su-34 i think
bug-reports 2023-04-30 18:00:31 my f-16 save got corrupted or something (hahaha so funny hahahaha)
blocks are randomly misplaced so none of the lock works anymore
plane-crazy 2023-05-01 20:06:34 the 1 bajillion ping in question

creations-chat 2023-05-02 21:43:13 did you plan for landing gear
creations-chat 2023-05-02 21:45:48 you should make the tailplanes a half block thick

general 2023-05-09 00:18:10 i would assume its on the faster side
general 2023-05-09 00:22:38 about 4-6 degree aoa for the f-16 flying with the p-51
general 2023-05-09 00:22:47 if i were to put in the effort i could find out how fast its going
general 2023-05-09 00:23:52 i think you could be able to figure it out using some kind of aoa graph for the f-16
general 2023-05-09 00:24:39 yeah
general 2023-05-09 00:24:46 also depends on altitude
general 2023-05-09 00:24:49 and bla bla bla
general 2023-05-09 00:24:52 dont feel likt it
general 2023-05-09 00:25:33 yeah im not doing that
general 2023-05-09 00:26:04 next air show i go to ill note down the speed they go on heritage flights
general 2023-05-09 00:39:48 looks like it should be a little bit smaller in that picture
general 2023-05-09 00:40:14 it doesnt matter
general 2023-05-09 00:40:18 just build it how you want it
general 2023-05-09 00:41:35 then again it might be cause of the fuel tanks
general 2023-05-09 00:41:40 cause in other pictures it looks taller
general 2023-05-09 00:41:52 
general 2023-05-09 00:41:59 doesnt matter
general 2023-05-09 00:42:10 jsut build it as you see fit
general 2023-05-09 00:42:45 assuming the fuel tanks in the first image are probably full
general 2023-05-09 00:43:11 the characters are blocks
general 2023-05-09 00:43:15 it dont matter

general 2023-05-09 03:47:51 f-117 is not outdated
general 2023-05-09 03:47:54 what are you talking about
general 2023-05-09 03:48:07 its only the 90s
general 2023-05-09 03:48:31 it was still used after it was formally "retired"
general 2023-05-09 03:49:47 well yeah
general 2023-05-09 03:49:52 but its also significantly more expensive
general 2023-05-09 03:50:40 all stealth aircraft are valuble fr

general 2023-05-09 03:52:25 oh nevermind
general 2023-05-09 03:52:29 its less than a b-52
general 2023-05-09 03:52:30 
general 2023-05-09 03:54:17 but either way the usaf is retiring the older bombers in favor of the b-21

plane-crazy 2023-05-10 00:46:08 and its only a pre order after 10 years
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 00:56:27 wasnt pc2 also supposed to have a procedurally generated map
plane-crazy 2023-05-10 00:57:30 yeah it would be useless for pvp

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:57:07 every jet
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:57:08 ever
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:57:09 so
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:57:56 a better analogy would be outturned by a mig-25
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:07 main nothing
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:12 stop playing wart hunter
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:34 boycott lazy greedy devs
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:59:34 for good reason
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:00:39 yk what game has good sim battles and has devs that put in the work
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:00:45 
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:13 try falcon bms instead
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:17 its even more in depth
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:22 but its only got the f-16
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:29 old sim
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:41 nah but its cheap
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:01:57 falcon bms is a mod
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:02:01 for falcon 4.0
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:02:47 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxU0ZqBNKJ8&ab_channel=JulienJohnston
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:05 falcon also has a better IFF system than DCS
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:09 along with a few other systems
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:19 dynamic campaign aswell
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:30 its 7 dollars on steam
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:47 but sims are a slippery slope
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:53 one minute your just buying the sim
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:54 next
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:03:59 you are buying rudder pedals
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:04:03 and full hotas setups
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:04:09 (totally not me)
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:04:24 further you go along
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:04:40 mouse and keyboard dont keep up
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:12 also you could always like
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:13 idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:15 pirate it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:28 just make sure the website ur doing it from is safe
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:39 usually the guys on reddit know
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:43 nah some are
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:52 got both spiderman games for free
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:18 just go on the reddit for r/piratedgames
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:21 they have a megathread
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:25 that covers some safe sites
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:45 is it steamunlocked
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:46 if so
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:06:50 dont use that
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:23 they are using files from an old piracy website
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:28 unsafe one
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:35 some of the files have trojans
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:38 not all
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:41 so ur probably fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:08:47 i just wouldnt use it again
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:10:54 check r/piratedgames megathread
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:10:58 they have safe websites there
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:12:24 usually the redditors know what they are talking about
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:12:28 they are all nerds
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:12:31 idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:12:31 or something

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 14:56:03 if someone copying your build ruins the game for you, i would assume you're pretty fragile
not coming in to defend copiers cause its a bit scummy
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 14:56:28 me personally
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 14:56:31 i wouldnt gaf
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 14:56:35 if someone copied all my builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 14:59:34 for realsies
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:00:13 best way to prevent copying is to put dumb problems into your build and make an extremely convoluted solution (trust me i definitely dont do this accidentally all the time)
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:02:53 have fun copying these two
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:03:46 you dont understand
i didnt have room to put the engines where they should have been so i had to motorlock each individually
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:04:05 also i am an avid camera user
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:04:40 heres when it worked at the begining of the year

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:06:13 i want it to work again
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:09:02 it doesnt spawn

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:10:08 spawned
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:10:32 WOAH WTF
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:10:34 it just like

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:15:00 i dont really like the whole canopy section and i think i could make it better if i just redid it
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:15:06 alot more compact too
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 15:15:09 and less pistons

plane-crazy 2023-07-01 19:00:58 howd u know
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:19:01 denial
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:19:56 i have an eenie weenie feeling the wings of the b-52 are a little thicker
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:20:29 yes you can
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:20:32 ur lying to urself
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:21:02 notice how these wings are 2 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:21:04 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 20:21:38 i think its 3 in some places
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:34:22 looking back this b1b was so shit lol
the spine should have been tapered also its way too long
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:38:49 meh idk about that, that one f-15 in creations looks pretty good, theres just alot more shitty builds cause the new people dont feel as pressured to make something good since most of the good players cant spawn their builds lol
(fuck pistons)
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:41:49 could use better nossle designs though, along with canopy supports
idk i might make an f-15 soon, the one i have rn is shitty only cause it was a test for variable intakes
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:44:28 i liked the idea but it ends up taking more space than it has to
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:47:54 why does your f-22 have draken wings lol, also i dont think stealth aircraft have american flags on em lmao

sorry to break it to you but that isnt quality lol
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:51:04 how tf do you think these look the same bro
what crack are you on
also performance dont mean shit in this server lol
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:53:10 id say im pretty good at making things look like the picture
now that i look at em side by side mine is a lil tall
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:55:23 also leaves a bit to be desired
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:57:26 if you call a pito tube an aerodynamic stick i dont think i should take advice from you 
also wheres the f-22 in this picture
creations-chat 2023-07-03 20:59:59 no one cares about performance in this server because pvp is dogshit lol
(my shittiest plane ü•±)
god this thing is awful jesus christ
the more i look at it the more i realize what a mistake this was
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:02:20 more like pvp is awful because pvp is awful lol
if you want to play pvp with planes just download war thunder or some shit
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:05:10 rockets are shit at tracking and guns are laggy asf 
fireworks are laggy asf
literally everything is laggy asf because its plane crazy
i had my pvp phase too lil bro, you will grow up some day
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:07:18 the bar is so low for pvp
this shit dominates, and looks like shit, but i dont play pvp because its shit
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:12:25 this shit probably performs better than that f-22 amalgamation in pvp
and i wasnt even trying to make it for pvp lol, it was just a test bed for rope actuated wing sweep cause i was curious

creations-chat 2023-07-03 22:34:51 2-0 was the results, first one was with the swing wing abomination second was with this

general 2023-07-09 19:52:24 i removed these thingies
general 2023-07-09 19:52:42 cause it looks real messed up from the top view
general 2023-07-09 19:52:50 it deserves to be put down
general 2023-07-09 19:54:18 yeah ik extreme skill issue
general 2023-07-09 19:54:22 i havent build shit for months
creations-chat 2023-07-09 19:56:59 no <:TROLOL:1046174766911995974>
general 2023-07-09 20:00:32 yeah it was originally custom
general 2023-07-09 20:00:33 from like
general 2023-07-09 20:00:34 the begining
general 2023-07-09 20:00:49 nuh uh
general 2023-07-09 20:00:51 fine
general 2023-07-09 20:00:55 ill choose another 3 engine
general 2023-07-09 20:00:56 aircraft
general 2023-07-09 20:01:24 yuh
general 2023-07-09 21:06:59 dunno
general 2023-07-09 21:07:10 theres not alot of good 3 engine aircraft that arent just commercial
general 2023-07-09 21:09:39 id rather find a 3 engine fighter that isnt hopelessly ugly
creations-chat 2023-07-09 21:26:18 no im saying it because it looks like ass
creations-chat 2023-07-09 21:32:07 
creations-chat 2023-07-09 23:17:23 my third f-14 so far
creations-chat 2023-07-09 23:22:56 <:peajak:1089415934357278830>
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:08:17 something feels off about this, someone figure out what it is pretty please
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:43:43 i declare this a failure, deleted
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:47:37 planning out a phantom that im actually gonna finish and put alot of effort in across a few days, not all in one night like alot of my other builds
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:49:54 nah im prob not gonna participate, i dont feel like designing a custom jet since there are like 2 tri engine fighters that have ever been planned out
also free bad f-14 front half
yeah i saw that its god awful im not building that
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:53:47 either i make the side of the front section 5 pixels off or piston lock it
prob gonna piston lock
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:55:51 i need to make this my best aircraft yet
i need to surpass that one other good f-4e 
i need to put on 500 decals and overcomplicate the lock so much even the most dedicated copier wouldnt dare
i must become mcdonald douglas
creations-chat 2023-07-10 01:58:09 i should just finish the f-4 and put a engine on one of the hardpoints lol
you have heard of the gunpod but have you heard of the enginepod
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:01:49 im done with making 262s, they are such a pain in the ass to get the front landing gear in
might consider the mig though
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:03:52 its 19 cause of this thingy also the 19 has 2 engines and the 17 has 1
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:07:00 also i havent ever really done this type of pre-planning when it comes to making stuff so its probably gonna be pretty accurate
creations-chat 2023-07-10 02:20:37 idk maybe, its just the livery on the thing im using so i can use any
i might make a few, turkey, SEA camo, germany, idk i will see
i do really like the refueling thing on the isreali version though
creations-chat 2023-07-10 03:05:16 yeah that one wasnt very efficient
creations-chat 2023-07-10 03:35:30 
creations-chat 2023-07-10 04:33:26 this was a pain in my ass to make the angle
creations-chat 2023-07-10 04:41:54 i would rather shoot myself <:peajak:1089415934357278830>
creations-chat 2023-07-10 06:48:38 f-4e progress, ill get back to work on it tomorrow
for the air force models, yes the nose is long. but for the navy/marines models the nose is stubby
creations-chat 2023-07-10 06:52:51 yeah just realized there was a lock error that made it a half block too long, fixing rn
creations-chat 2023-07-10 17:50:16 why did you make the motor for your elevator at the very front
make it in the middle or im gonna hunt your family down
creations-chat 2023-07-10 18:01:30 <a:sonar:1128022994799820942> just made a sonar/radar emoji and u cant have it <:TROLOL:1046174766911995974>

general 2023-07-10 18:04:56 the cake may just possibly be a lie
general 2023-07-10 18:06:37 f-4e so far
general 2023-07-10 18:08:32 i had a choise to either
general 2023-07-10 18:08:42 copy srs nose design
general 2023-07-10 18:08:44 or make my own
general 2023-07-10 18:08:53 guess im making my own
general 2023-07-10 18:10:17 
general 2023-07-10 18:12:39 thing is i dont just wanna do this type of nose since its been done twice now
general 2023-07-10 18:14:14 also from the front it looks really really bad
general 2023-07-10 18:15:08 yeah i will, dont mind the panel gaps at the moment
general 2023-07-10 18:15:27 this shit is making me wanna hang myself
general 2023-07-10 18:16:15 i mean i could always just make it an RF-4e
general 2023-07-10 18:16:27 i think thats what im gonna do
general 2023-07-10 18:16:35 last resort
general 2023-07-10 18:17:25 
general 2023-07-10 18:17:34 it would fix all my problems tho
general 2023-07-10 18:17:51 wahhhh
creations-chat 2023-07-10 18:18:43 
general 2023-07-10 18:19:02 aussie f-4e
general 2023-07-10 18:19:06 the nose is long
general 2023-07-10 18:19:37 https://tenor.com/view/youngboys-max-balderston-jfork-evan-star-wars-evan-stalnaker-gif-20306088
general 2023-07-10 18:28:13 currently the predicament is, keep working on what i have now OR recreate it using sr's nose design
general 2023-07-10 18:28:28 i dont think there are many other ways to do the nose on this thing if im gonna be honest
general 2023-07-10 18:28:49 yeah hes not even here anymore anyways
general 2023-07-10 18:29:20 also an issue he was having with it was he couldnt add much more detail
general 2023-07-10 18:29:26 cause of piston lag
general 2023-07-10 18:29:27 or something
general 2023-07-10 18:29:28 so
general 2023-07-10 18:29:32 now that its gone
general 2023-07-10 18:30:11 yeah
general 2023-07-10 18:30:39 i also really like the way he did the wings with the aerofoil type thing
general 2023-07-10 18:30:54 <:TROLOL:1046174766911995974>
general 2023-07-10 18:31:07 i like the color orange
general 2023-07-10 18:32:03 srs f-4 is kinda lackin in the intakes though, im gonna see if i can find a new way to do them
general 2023-07-10 18:34:55 there aint no way
general 2023-07-10 18:38:36 alllright then
general 2023-07-10 18:38:43 no need to elaborate
general 2023-07-10 18:38:46 :D
