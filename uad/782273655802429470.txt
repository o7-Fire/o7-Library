general 2023-05-13 09:22:03 How am I then supposed to ask for help
general 2023-05-13 09:22:21 "Help i need help with detailing"
general 2023-05-13 09:22:34 "Your build is not detailed enough, we won't help you do make it"
general 2023-05-13 09:24:35 Like bruh is that even possible in plane crazy
general 2023-05-13 09:25:11 Imagine assembling it and when you didn't load it, it's just one hell of random blocks floating attached to motors and cameras
general 2023-05-13 09:25:30 Plus I am mobile person <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-05-13 09:26:23 But I need help balancing my V-22 copy I allegedly build on my own without help (yet) <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-05-13 10:09:22 I
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:28:02 Ok yis
bot-central 2023-05-13 12:28:11 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:28:29 Oh i got LVL3 now
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:29:52 How do i balance my VTOL craft without helium, when i go up or down, the back tail has too much drag, (ex. If I fly up, the tail wing will make the aircraft flip backwards, if I fly down, the tail wing will make the aircraft flip forwards)
the-dump 2023-05-13 12:31:41 
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:39:52 Propellers?
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:07 In what way
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:23 I'll try I guess
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:50 Ballast?
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:54 No that won't work I think
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 12:40:59 I'll try the propellers
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:09:20 Do you think this VTOL can qualify for VTOL engineer? Or do the wings need to be completely horizontal to be considered VTOL? I mean, the body is flat towards flying but the wings are tilted. The location of the engines will naturally force the plane downwards. (No helium)
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:10:02 It has Horizontal stabilizers and flaps. Ailerons, etc
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:10:06 Bruh
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:10:35 Is the community that harsh on being "pro builder"
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:11:16 I joined today
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:11:44 So if it meets criteria, i can just upload my Craft?
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:11:56 Since it has 520ish blocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:12:38 Cool
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:13:28 Plus the fact, idk how to effectively do motor clipping and use disconnector walls, it's almost pure vanilla aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:14:06 Random dude flying in the background
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:14:14 He was just tailing me for fun
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:14:42 So uhm, what does an 'expert designer' build look like
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:15:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:15:21 Don't make me cry now
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:15:29 Go ahead Ig
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:16:24 Cool
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:16:26 Uhm
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:16:33 How did you hey small turret cilinder
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:16:57 Ong what ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:17:13 Yall using explosives to make details ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:17:38 And I thought using disconnectors was the most unique it could get
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:18:05 I dont use pvp servers much
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:18:12 Since it's annoying to use guns on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:19:12 Arguemen
Arguement*
(Wasn't it argument* after all?)
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:19:29 Me broke ah hell
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:21:50 So anyways, does my "VTOL" fit for the requirements as the wings can't do a full 90Â° horizontal? (If I do, the plane will keep doing frontflips because of placement)

P.s. the engines can go a small bit more horizontal than shown in image
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 13:23:02 The engine is located on COM, if it goes between Center of Wings and Mass, it will tilt forward when hovering idle
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 16:44:13 Here's a question for everyone: How did you guys manage to find a glitch that could be used for speed, what and why?
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 16:44:24 Grian or something
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 17:06:10 Make it work like this: idk how to explain it but here is random image i found to explain
plane-crazy 2023-05-13 17:06:14 Lmao

general 2023-05-14 07:50:18 It's ***what*** missile

plane-crazy 2023-05-20 08:42:26 I attempted to make a simple slim racing car

general 2023-05-20 13:36:55 That bullet won't fly out 50 meters and will create one hell of a flash since the barrel doesn't line up to the bullet so when fired, the gas will escape around the bullet

2 extra points if you name it John Moose
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:21:54 I cant do suggestions nor do they get added so ill discuss them here
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:21:56 Motor 3
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:22:10 Litterally a mix of a normal motor and a propellor engine
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:22:25 It spins faster the longer you press the key to make is spin
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:22:41 The same way a normal engine does
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:23:37 But now its a motor
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 13:23:50 So you don't need engines to spin helicopter blade lol
the-dump 2023-05-28 18:24:51 Definitely do not mix Nitroglycerin with flour or dough. And by no means, do not coat it with candle wax to make a easily constructed coating. That's redneck Impact Grenade and is super duper dangerous
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:48:34 The one with conformal fuel tanks?
creations-chat 2023-06-10 13:58:14 Got my custom VTOL, is there anything to improve do you think for it?

- glass beneath pilot seats for bottom view
- airtight doors
- hoists + hoists extender
- blade angle change (but thats needed standard for these types of bladed craft)
-  enough space
creations-chat 2023-06-10 14:16:26 Thanks, is there anything to add to it
general 2023-06-11 04:44:47 Did paranoia test a few days ago

plane-crazy 2023-06-12 17:38:58 Having trouble with my VTOL
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 17:38:59 
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 17:39:01 Everytime i takeoff, the tail wing will make it go backwards but if i land, it will make it tilt forwards
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 17:39:27 (The build isnt based off of the V22, they are similar)
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 17:39:49 How do I fix this
the-dump 2023-06-12 17:40:34

creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:44:31 And replace with what
creations-chat 2023-06-13 17:52:12 How is the build (if you didnt compare it to "average" builds)
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:53:58 <@1061207193648631839> i based the basic parts off of this
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:55:08 What
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:55:35 I want my builds to be accessible mostly, easy walking inside and utility
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:55:54 I also have a VTOL which is built around being able to sit inside comfortably
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:56:31 Oh it works fine alright
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:56:38 And it looks fine as i can say
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:56:52 Hoists
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:56:54 Flaps
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:57:05 Uhh
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:57:17 Doors that work smoothly
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:57:47 The only problem is that if the engine is horizonal
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:57:54 It will
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:57:57 Well
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:58:05 Make the plane go in a dive?
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:58:20 Since the engines and wings are place higher on the balance.
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 17:58:38 Can my VTOL qualify for the VTOL rank?
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 18:01:29 These are the controls btw
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 18:02:11 I know
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 18:02:19 But i mean
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 18:02:25 The controls are needed
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 18:04:02 Idk

plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:37:57 We need another one thats half the sharpness and size
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 09:30:34 How does it even feel to make a plane upside down since its a tad bit larger and needs for be folded
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 11:25:21 I am trying to make a Leopard 2a5+
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 11:25:50 Is there anything to improve to it (except for looking better in detail)

plane-crazy 2023-06-21 13:55:38 Simple as that
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 13:56:08 It has an interior
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 14:55:18 It needed an walkable interior
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 14:55:37 Try making it flatter yourself and fit people in there to move

plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:22:33 <:StopThat:559520667909881867>
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:23:16 Tell me what
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:26:14 Shut up
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:26:18 Shut up to everyone right now
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:26:58 No one else wanted to hear you talk here
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:28:28 I asked for help on what to add, not your "motivational quotes"
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:29:22 Litterally
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:29:49 Being a shithead isnt considered helping
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:30:08 I really hope litterally any figure has ever told you that
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:30:51 Being toxic is ðŸ¤®
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:30:55 Exactly
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:31:05 Thats the worst answer anyone could have given
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:31:23 Instead of simply giving some **nice*** help
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:32:55 Thats not even the initial question i asked
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:33:06 Well nice for telling that  now
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:33:23 As if you couldve said in the first place
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:35:50 Yeah since thats how helping works
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:44:52 This is the second time you couldnt act normal to others
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:46:25 Are you contemplating if you should be normal?
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:47:34 Because thats how a community works
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 15:53:07 Heres a response, you told me i cant build because of my early build that barely was even finished yet. 

I asked for some *help* to ask people what they think would look better, not some idiotic response about it looking bad, as if i didnt know it looks bad, spoiler alert, ||every build that isnt finished looks bad||. So if you cant think of a way to answer properly at all, dont say anything

the-dump 2023-07-16 12:05:08 Did you know that if you find an Anglerfish, it is very common to say it's a female. The male Angler fish are around 5 times smaller than the female and will either die or be absent after *being* with the female Angler fish

creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:40:42 I haven't seen any tanks with interior

How does anyone make suspension with motor cilinder wheels more compact so its either only 1 or 2 blocks wide and doesn't cause any issues
^
For tanks
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:42:44 Something where multiple people can sit inside and simulate crew in the tank
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:59:36 I mean, a tank with multiple seats so others can sit in technically accurate positio s
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:01:38 I have a barely work interior tank but the only motorlock is the turret so it's airtight with the barrel. For the rest, I can't find a very functional way to have the suspension wheels be 1 or 2 block thinner without it glitching out and still be able to work as normal wheels and not propellers  driving it
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:03:40 I'm not that professional yet, I would've gotten engineering rank if i was able to build functional tracks.

 It would also take up a lot of space aswell, so not that compact anymore
