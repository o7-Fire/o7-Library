general 2022-04-22 00:01:14 you do realise that some people cant afford a pc correct?
general 2022-04-22 00:01:31 not everyone is as **privileged** as you are.
general 2022-04-22 00:02:18 jobs exist but people under 15 cant get jobs
general 2022-04-22 00:02:22 ever think of that?
general 2022-04-22 00:02:42 thats 1 year under

plane-crazy 2023-01-24 00:49:58 eh nvm ill just test it myself
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 00:51:41 its 2, you need to put 2 on a ballast block to have it be equal to one person and one chair
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:35:21 cant wait for PC2
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:35:56 realistic timeframe
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:36:36 2025
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:37:28 im actually surprised they are making a second plane crazy, the original has been around for 9 years
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:38:11 looks like something is keeping the motors from actually locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:38:52 3 stacks of motorlock failure that is clear to see and he asks us whats wrong
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:39:20 bro got called out by 2 bots
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:40:39 grill me a cheese
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:41:15 how did you get the motors to sound like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:41:22 oh wait they are  jet engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:41:45 i only use rocket engines so i have no idea what jet engines sound like
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:42:04 and 100 percent of the time my sounds are turned off because of the mass amount of rocket engines
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:42:19 ask away
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:42:35 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:42:58 cant answer a question if you havent asked it so ask away
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:43:18 good for looks but not really for power
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:43:29 i dont see it
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:44:11 guardian mech with tons of weapons legit overload it with guns and rockets
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:44:30 that would be cool yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:44:45 you never know when something will attack
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:45:14 will plane crazy 2 be able to load all your builds to save files?
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:45:18 or will you have to rebuild them
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:45:22 i hope its not the latter
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:45:31 ok good
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:46:33 if its fake im going to be so angry because pc2 was the one game pc related that would ACTUALLY listen to suggestions
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:47:20 i am the danger
plane-crazy 2023-01-28 17:47:51 idk blocks or something, could also be that the motors arent locked
