The Tale of kekaroo (301819873879654400)
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 12:19:42 anyone interested in futuristic builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:11:10 arena rockets are serverside
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:11:18 which means destruction caused by rockets everyone can see
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:11:25 destruction caused by arena guns are clientside
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:11:28 meaning only you can see it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:12:43 is arena still broken
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 13:28:38 are arena rockets left click just like arena guns?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:40:28 anyone built a bipedal mech yet?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:40:51 just use a few helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:40:55 seems cheapskate but what else can ya do
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:46:25 if someone builds an eldar tank from wh40k i'll be impressed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:47:18 to be fair it doesnt even look nice lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:48:18 build a dreadnought from wh40k
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:48:24 that walks ðŸ˜ƒ
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:50:17 hes the ladder man
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:50:35 Maximus Laddus, Defender Of Joints
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:48 <@282872552886501377> 4 1x7s and a bunch of wedges lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:53:17 no but it looks very cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:53:44 wtf
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:54 can someone make some ships from no man's sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:55:42 I actually see what james means
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:04 It feels uncomfortable having a giant ass starship that's not even 200 studs long
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:25 <@282872552886501377> Okay that's cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:27 too chunky
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:37 <@282872552886501377> i like
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:59:19 Challenge accepted
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:59:57 weird flex but ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:00:34 wait are totten's builds basically statues
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:38 ^^ truth
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:51 WOAH
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:56 NICE <@469787264885456897>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:02:25 do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:09:12 weird flex but ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:15:34 i really want keybindings for rockets because then we can create magazines ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:15:45 there are?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:15:54 When i use the screwdriver it never highlights them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:15:55 weird
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:16:17 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:16:46 i think some blocks should have more detailed modifications too
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:16:56 the reset option for the motor should be adjustable
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:17:04 so the time it takes to reset
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:17:07 after moving it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:17:25 i've always wondered what are those cages on tanks used for?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:17:28 is it to reflect rpgs?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:17:35 deflect*
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:22:24 So wait is just using the basic 1x1 blocks the best part for armoured builds?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:33:09 do missiles have solid damage in the entire explosion or does the damage decrease the further you are away from the center of the explosion?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:33:46 shame
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:08 So if a tiny bit of 1 block is touching the edge of the explosion, it gets destroyed?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:16 well that sucks
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:34 cages don't really work then
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:48 you gotta stick them really far away from the tank but then it looks ugly
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:38:33 r8
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:38:43 thx
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:39:22 wym
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:39:30 nah just cubes and wedges
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:39:42 ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:40:33 top view
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:40:37 the guns at the back are for interceptors btw
creations-chat 2018-11-11 21:43:26 
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:12:28 dont go breaking my
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:12:48 is there any role for bipedal mechs
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:00 i'm gonna finish mine and you guys better be impressed ðŸ˜¡
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:13:11 probably won't be finished for a while though
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:26:31 Wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:26:49 You can achieve lightspeed on computer fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:26:57 You know the virtual world doesn't use proper physics
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:27:10 So to spot something in a game it doesn't use the system of speed of light
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:27:51 I mean there is
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:28:21 A stud in roblox is like 1 foot
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:28:31 1 km is 1000 studs in that context
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:28:51 and light is 300,000 km per second
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:29:04 so in that theory, light speed in roblox is 300,000,000 studs per second
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:29:09 does that clear it up?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:29:34 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:29:51 that's not how it works
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:30:08 1000 feet in a km and 1 stud = 1 foot so 1 km = 1000 studs and 300,000 x 1000 = 300,000,000
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:30:39 Actually you're right my mistake
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:30:47 let me convert and actually get it right this time
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:31:07 ok so 3281 feet in a km
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:31:11 so do 300,000 x 3281
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:31:34 984,300,000 studs per second SHOULD be the speed of light
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:31:50 because then it's easier to understand the size of a robloxian
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:32:11 i am from the uk and obviously use metric but using feet in this context is good because we know that 1 foot = 1 stud
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:32:59 common sense maybe?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:33:18 roblox is SUPPOSED to be for kids and i'd imagine most kids are 5 feet tall and robloxians are 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:33:42 so you want 6 feet or 5 feet
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:33:46 which seems more realistic
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:06 i think sticking with 5 feet just makes it easier
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:13 otherwise it'll have to be 1.2 feet per stud ughh
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:17 skybox idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:25 gigaparsecs probably lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:29 zettaparsecs?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:47 how
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:51 dont you hit the void first
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:34:55 or the kill wall
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:02 what the frick
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:10 so you use helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:42 yeah im pretty sure roblox servers have these things where once you reach a certain distance your character starts to break down into its 2d polygons
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:35:52 you know those images of people reaching lightspeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:36:01 it might be something to do with preventing lag from other players
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:36:36 because if it didn't break down into 2d polygons players from billions of miles away would have trouble rendering
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:36:49 and the lag would probably be nasty
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:37:39 theory: skybox is the universe
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:37:50 you get kicked because god doesnt want you to see outside lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:38:12 nah im fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:38:28 actually send it i might join another time
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:39:20 basically a way of simplifying it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:39:26 you guys ever played gta?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:39:35 cars disappear at long distances to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:39:50 if the entire map was functioning even if you're isolated from the map you'd lag loads
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:41:27 That is indeed what happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:41:31 Real life is worse though...
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:41:35 Travel at lightspeed in real life
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:41:42 First of all you'd die from the g force
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:41:45 But let's ignore the g force
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:14 Travelling at lightspeed in real life (if  you could survive the g force) you would likely see just blackness or behind your head
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:35 If we wasn't ignoring g force then yeah lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:42 unlikely actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:47 hitting planets at light speed is very hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:55 nearest solar system to earth is like 4 lightyears away
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:42:59 or 1
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:11 but yeah you'd hit space debris
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:13 and that yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:28 so many gs of force
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:36 You'd die from the gs first i'd reckon
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:44 your brain would just get liquidated at the back of your skull
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:50 from lightspeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:43:57 that's not lightspeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:44:06 lightspeed should be 900,000,000+
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:44:13 yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:44:52 at that speed all of your flesh would be torn straight off the bone and you'd have a nice boneless kiri1234jojo ready to eat!
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:45:06 indeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:45:20 anyone interested in time travel
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:45:28 not possible but interesting what catastrophes it could cause
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:45:41 also maybe we should go to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:46:11 yep
general 2018-11-13 17:46:25 also
general 2018-11-13 17:46:36 i think roblox being a vacuum shows why you fall so fast
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:46:57 <@!281989877816492033> <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-11-13 17:48:11 but
general 2018-11-13 17:48:13 the problem is
general 2018-11-13 17:48:18 how strong is roblox's gravity
general 2018-11-13 17:48:33 i mean think about objects getting flung,
general 2018-11-13 17:48:49 ok so at the moment we'll just say 1 stud = 1 foot
general 2018-11-13 17:48:53 makes it alot easier
general 2018-11-13 17:49:22 yep
general 2018-11-13 17:49:41 luckily in plane crazy we have a speedometer
general 2018-11-13 17:49:47 so we can calculate the speed of falling
general 2018-11-13 17:49:56 and also we can measure acceleration
general 2018-11-13 17:50:14 how long an object takes to fall
general 2018-11-13 17:50:20 wait
general 2018-11-13 17:50:40 woah
general 2018-11-13 17:50:56 ok so we'll use 5cm
general 2018-11-13 17:50:59 or 1 foot?
general 2018-11-13 17:51:01 wait no
general 2018-11-13 17:51:16 for us to make it realistic, the character sizes need to be realistic too
general 2018-11-13 17:51:23 so we'll stick to 1 foot yeah
general 2018-11-13 17:51:36 okay wait what's the equation for gravitational force
general 2018-11-13 17:52:13 impossible to be honest
general 2018-11-13 17:52:43 already been done though hasn't it
general 2018-11-13 17:52:45 5cm
general 2018-11-13 17:52:54 but we're pretending that this is realistic
general 2018-11-13 17:53:40 tiny
general 2018-11-13 17:53:57 ye
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 17:54:13 warp cannons
general 2018-11-13 17:54:38 but then we already know that the gravitational force is the same as earth's
general 2018-11-13 17:54:51 because it said that if it has the same gravity as earth, 1 stud = 5 cm
general 2018-11-13 17:55:40 alright
general 2018-11-13 17:55:46 but hang on
general 2018-11-13 17:55:51 ok i know how we do this
general 2018-11-13 17:55:57 without even doing experiments
general 2018-11-13 17:56:03 so we're pretending robloxians are 5 ft tall
general 2018-11-13 17:56:15 30.48 cm in 1 foot
general 2018-11-13 17:56:45 earth's gravitational force is 9.8m/s to the power of 2
general 2018-11-13 17:56:58 so this means every second your speed increases by 9.8m/s
general 2018-11-13 17:57:43 ok so now we do 30.48 divided by 5
general 2018-11-13 17:57:53 6.096
general 2018-11-13 17:58:02 multiply the earth's gravitational field strength by 6.096
general 2018-11-13 17:58:13 59.7408
general 2018-11-13 17:58:15 so in theory
general 2018-11-13 17:58:27 roblox's gravitational field strength is 59.7408m/s  to the power of 2
general 2018-11-13 17:58:30 which wtf that's strong
general 2018-11-13 17:58:40 legit go 150m in 2 seconds
general 2018-11-13 17:58:48 as soon as you jump off something
general 2018-11-13 17:59:43 wait maybe not even that
general 2018-11-13 17:59:52 wait HELL NO
general 2018-11-13 17:59:59 60 m/s
general 2018-11-13 18:00:12 so now do 1000 divided by 60
general 2018-11-13 18:00:26 16.6666667
general 2018-11-13 18:00:27 yuck
general 2018-11-13 18:00:34 okay that's yucky
general 2018-11-13 18:01:16 wait how are we gonna do this
general 2018-11-13 18:01:40 alright
general 2018-11-13 18:03:02 lightspeed very hard
general 2018-11-13 18:03:23 how will you reach lightspeed
general 2018-11-13 18:03:28 helium + thrusters?
general 2018-11-13 18:03:32 wait hang on
general 2018-11-13 18:03:40 nvm
general 2018-11-13 18:03:45 do experiments
general 2018-11-13 18:04:10 try 1
general 2018-11-13 18:04:11 then 2
general 2018-11-13 18:04:12 then 3
general 2018-11-13 18:04:21 and see how much it increases
general 2018-11-13 18:04:23 every second
general 2018-11-13 18:04:33 because i'm pretty sure it refreshes the speed every second
general 2018-11-13 18:05:01 if it goes from 0 to 60 and then 60 to  180 then it's 60m/s to the power of 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 20:45:08 there was a game like that before attrition
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 20:45:12 it was called Warfare []
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 20:45:25 i reckon some people here remember it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 20:45:38 it was more fun than attrition in my opinion
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 20:45:40 not sure why
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 21:00:04 what new items are there?
general 2018-11-24 03:09:51 DID ANYONE WATCH CHICKEN LITTLE AS A KID
general 2018-11-24 03:10:05 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxhZ2gJP4i8 THIS SONG BRINGS SO MUCH NOSTALGIA
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 18:41:45 
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 18:54:16 why does explode on impact not work
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 18:54:22 when it hits another player it doesn't detonate
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 18:54:28 only detonates if it makes contact with me
creations-chat 2019-05-19 12:32:18 <@!530774331081621504> fr bro just take a gif
creations-chat 2019-05-19 12:32:25 do u not have gyazo or sumn
creations-chat 2019-05-19 22:40:04 Thatâ€™s very creative
creations-chat 2019-05-19 22:40:07 I like
creations-chat 2019-05-24 19:39:12 i dont like undertale so i downvoted
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:19:22 how do i increase the weight capacity of a motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:19:24 like how do i
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:19:30 make so the motor can deal with more mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:20:40 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:21:01 it still wobbles loads tho
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:23:08 and now i cnat
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:23:11 my gif recorder just broke
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:24:13

plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:26:31 horizontal
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:26:37 i actually reduced torque to 1 and it helped
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:26:38 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:26:54 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:27:03 not sure if i need them now that i reduced torque
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:27:08 oh yeah there are anchors now
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 18:27:11 i completely forgot
plane-crazy 2019-08-15 01:21:13 when is the next update expected to release?
plane-crazy 2019-08-15 01:21:58 ok thx
plane-crazy 2019-08-15 01:40:58 bro that plane is a literal triplane

plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:12:25 what you guys think
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:12:42 tried to make as compact as possible while providing hoverboardish movements
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:13:07 snow thrusters increase in power with a separate pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:14:10 oh i mean like
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:14:24 i increase the snow thrusters power using a separate pilot seat
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 00:14:39 cause its the only way to really make it move without having a pilot seat onboard the vehicle
