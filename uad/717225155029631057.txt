creations-chat 2022-02-19 04:50:20 not really, although i can use them any additional detail i add at the back would force me to make another motor lock tower and im too lazy to do it. also i like how much more compact springs are in build mode. 

yea that is a big problem with a lot of my planes but i find sticking some helium on the back usually works

<@914605911744593930>  add has 2 vertical stabilizers aswell
creations-chat 2022-04-26 01:28:18 no we are roasting you because it looks like you have never seen a jet before, let alone an f4 phantom. Maybe before building a plane you could look it up to see what it looks like instead of just eyeballing it

i would suggest you do that
creations-chat 2022-04-26 01:30:12 also so you don't screw it up again, here is what it looks like <@817136897758330950>

plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:43:46 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:44:20 you dont need to be an expert designer to make something not look shit

plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:46:45 bro just use a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:46:51 it helps a lot
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:47:02 i started off from mad vulpen tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:48:22 crazy how far tuts bring people
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:49:17 i mean most of us got here from tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:50:59 learning it from a tutorial is a lot easier
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:51:37 thats the only way to play
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:52:29 maybe back when the game was new
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:52:43 bro look at the title

plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:55:57 you havent got anywhere
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:56:21 na thats the origami path
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:57:18 this got its roots from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:58:04 you gotta start off from somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:58:27 tutorials are just a regular part
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:59:34 it isn't, but a lot of tutorials help you get past the point of making shit builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 23:59:52 these are the type of tutorials i used
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 00:02:55 first of all, if anyone would have to use their head, its anyone who uses advanced motor lock and or piston lock, if you think its hard to make whatever you are making, good luck getting better. second of all, that su 22 looks like its just a tube with wings, you def aint using any techniques
