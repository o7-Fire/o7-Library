general 2022-04-10 16:08:45 hi
general 2022-04-10 16:09:11 turboprop airliner
general 2022-04-10 16:10:01 russian tank that is being hauled by ukrainian tractor
general 2022-04-10 16:10:20 and realistic
general 2022-04-10 16:11:05 just make some airliner
general 2022-04-10 16:11:11 or just practice building planes
general 2022-04-10 16:13:10 looks like planes that noobs make without wedges
general 2022-04-10 16:13:16 they always are just so blocky
general 2022-04-10 16:13:59 i mean they have their own taste, but i just prefer planes that look semi realistic
general 2022-04-10 16:15:23 cool
general 2022-04-10 16:15:59 same
general 2022-04-10 16:16:38 also cool
general 2022-04-10 16:17:21 i like to make airliners, im just bad at making them look smooth
general 2022-04-10 16:17:46 today is the day i build an actual solid looking plane
general 2022-04-10 16:19:00 <:BIG1:588443768806703124><:BIG2:588443778554134540>
<:BIG3:588443788721258534><:BIG4:588443798842114088>
general 2022-04-10 16:19:51 i constructed some good looking plane after 20 years of struggle, i made something that can be considered looking fine
general 2022-04-10 16:20:09 all these years of struggle finally paid off
general 2022-04-10 16:21:18 i wonder what new blocks will be in pc2 now
general 2022-04-10 16:21:35 like will there be better tnt for making bombs
general 2022-04-10 16:22:54 i just want better tnt to be in pc2, or at least one that doesnt stick to walls and only disconnectors
bot-central 2022-04-10 16:23:37 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:35:37 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:41:36 kidney stones
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:42:12 im great at anatomy, obviously kidney stones are in the rib cage and rib cage is in your head
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:46:41 i know but like kindeys stay in ur head, brain is also in there and it controls the nerves so it would hurt the kidneys
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:48:35 my turboprop plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:49:06 like wat details
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:49:29 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:52:39 btw the motors are motorlocked, so now it has motorlocking and details
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:55:44 this emoji is giving head to shrek

plane-crazy 2022-04-10 16:59:27 idk why, just it is how life is
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 17:03:39 i mean you need experience
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 17:04:18 to make it look better
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 17:16:33 i mean the only thing i want is nuke

plane-crazy 2022-04-10 19:02:26 i ain't really on with the news
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 19:08:40 its too advanced for my tiny puny brain to comprehend
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 19:20:12 oh yeah i forgor
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 19:20:30 i made my first car in the mechania

plane-crazy 2022-04-10 20:00:07 world trade center
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 20:00:22 it was cool until some guy did emergency landing
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 20:23:10 how can i make gear for like larger airliners?
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 20:26:57 Sure...
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 08:40:08 tell me what narrow airliner to make
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 08:56:20 ill build it after im done with something else
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:42:12 i got access to beta of pc2
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:45:23 i mean its decent
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:48:49 skill
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:55:45 how can i make my plane lighter
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:55:59 its just is too thick to take off
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:56:17 gotta check smth
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:57:29 i just had to check if ballast blocks aint lighter
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 09:57:45 half blocks are the lighest from the quick tests
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:01:52 nope
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:02:06 i have 12 of them in the back and it barely can fly
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:02:18 probally just my bad building skills
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:02:58 ye
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:03:16 ill work on it for some time
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:07:41 i think ill just abandon the plane and start from scratch
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:12:24 to post images u need level 3 pretty sure
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:12:55 idk then
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:30:47 u don't
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:39:07 i never know what wedge to use when making plane noses -_-
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:39:40 great idea
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:39:46 just mash all wedges together
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:41:15 ye
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:42:33 i mean its just a lot of trial and error
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:43:17 tu-114 nose is gonna be pain in the ass to make
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:45:19 i mean its just so irregular
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:45:33 i mean engines are the easiest part
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:45:44 the nose and tail are the parts i struggle with
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:46:57 ye i have no idea what wedge could fit here
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:53:20 it looks like it got bonked in the nose and had a seizure
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:19:32 best nose to exist
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:19:36 can't compare it
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:20:39 also how the hell i make an tail
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:21:39 nvm figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:42:57 what the hell is that suggestion
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 11:51:42 found the guy who made it lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:02:33 nvm i lost a bit more
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:15:01 that guy is actually nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:15:29 i mean the plane may not look good but he tried
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:18:31 ye
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:35:28 is that your voice?
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 12:39:52 eh he tried
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:14:46 yo you know that game?
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:15:03 true chad right here
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:15:14 use heatsink
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:15:37 maybe just flip the radiator
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:15:43 like 180 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 13:16:08 maybe pipes are connected in wrong way
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:18:09 why my plane does not take off until it falls from the like straight ground near base
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:20:06 so more speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:20:37 i mean it flies normally after that
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:22:01 i mean there is never enough speed is there?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:24:28 ill add more speed and it will be fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:26:01 it was in build mode
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:42:11 use this great nose
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:42:22 you're welcome
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:47:30 no one can find you with this nose
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:47:57 if you use it, you are considered chad
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:54:19 i think you just turn off on/off mode
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:54:26 Tu-114
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:54:42 good luck m8
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:54:47 especially with nose
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:55:23 bombardied dash-8
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:57:27 that is called acceleration
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:57:35 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:58:10 fine i don't wanna argue over dumb shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:58:50 i mean idk why would you want some crap like that
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 09:58:55 oh wait propellers
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:11:31 and?
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:11:48 i don't spend 20 hours of my life in a plane building game like you
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:12:32 its good enough for me
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:12:52 it flies good enough
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:13:03 it can take off and thats everything that is important
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:13:23 it got super rocket in every prop engine, and like 12 in back
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:13:26 it can fly great
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:14:28 it can turn pretty fast
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:15:20 well since it can't go that fast.. so i guess no
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:15:32 bruh this is not an fighter jet
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:15:49 i got other planes that are supposed to go fast
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:16:12 no, it never is good idea
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:17:03 yeah that is why i should not show any of my planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:24:37 maybe you show your own airliner then

plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:26:39 why tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 10:27:00 if we get better parts but no more space then the potential will be wasted
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:29:23 i got access to pc2
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:31:20 if you can outrun the bullets, you don't need to have weapons on you!
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 14:31:51 tu-114 is also a pain to build
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 15:53:17 what gamepass should i buy?
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 16:12:09 bozo with shredder could not hit my big zepelin lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 20:05:05 anyone wants a file nuke?
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:24:13 just make her t-pose
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:24:25 no issue in that
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:24:54 fart jokes are the best jokes on the internet
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:25:10 try fo rd
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:25:46 oh well then, good luck
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:28:49 why did i  choose to make A-50
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:29:19 soviet recconaissance plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:29:28 with an radar on top
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 13:30:41 this thing sucks to build because of how it looks
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:27:56 Why does no one make trains or boats in game 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:30:42 There is non pvp mode for an reason 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:31:46 I see that im surrounded by land enjoyers, i gotta prove that boats are not inferior
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:18:52 the boats really cut down the fps
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:18:56 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:19:12 every turn my frames go from 120 into 12
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:21:20 i become an water hater, at least in game
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:25:15 boats eat my frames
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 12:25:22 or anything water related
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:10:30 fr tho why are my frames dying in water
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:12:01 some random 8 year olds are gonna make invisible cages
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:12:57 still
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:13:13 not a good idea to give them more options to choose
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:22:10 i made an propeller plane but instead of normal speed and maneuvaribillity, it can outmaneuver an F-15 raptor and go mach 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:22:26 i messed something up with the lightweight frame
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:25:26 then yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:26:27 i mean there is never enough speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:29:45 maybe not enough wing surface?
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:31:51 if you have too much helium then it's gonna be an balloon
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:32:00 doubt you are going for that
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:34:36 send pic
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:36:29 i do not have enough determination to do something like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:40:39 this small plane took me way longer than it should have did
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 17:40:49 in the end im kinda happy with the result
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:20:40 is 460 speed a lot?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:23:03 alright then so my propeller plane speed is fine
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:43:26 pretty cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:46:41 bruh someone said im toxic after i called him out for using an tutorial lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:47:37 some madvulpen plane, idk which one it was exactly
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:48:13 it's this one
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:49:31 and now he blacklisted me lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:49:49 ngl that was kinda an interesting interaction
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:50:49 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:51:24 the driving shredders are the easiest to dodge, the flying ones are the most annoying ones to dodge
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 11:51:37 i mean they go mach 3 and follow you with laser precision
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 12:01:54 then don't
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 17:55:18 imma try to make an-400
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 17:55:23 it will go horribly wrong
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:00:32 and it did
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:48:44 uh a lot of time
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:49:15 i mean all you really need to use is triangle wedge block and triangle wedges to make ur build look half decent
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:50:02 eh maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:51:20 i mean not every build but yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:51:42 imagine an commercial jet airliner with jet fighter nose lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:52:49 i said not for every build you stu monkey
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:53:13 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:53:40 i don't
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:58:29 rate my shitty a-400 atlas
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 18:58:48 ye, i knew it was shitty
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:00:31 imagine they had actual scorpions inside lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:00:49 are they alive?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:00:56 aw sad
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:01:20 dunno im not an rocket engineer
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:02:29 r u sure that wasn't australia?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 19:02:43 F-15
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 08:01:33 how the hell can i make cargo door
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 08:08:27 aw frick that is gonna take forever to figure out
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 09:59:47 motor2
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:00:03 it literally does what you said
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:00:20 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:01:25 bruh duh
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:01:36 they are motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:01:42 they only have one axis rotation
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:02:34 just do this
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:02:43 it's that easy
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:04:37 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:35:26 THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT A CAT BUT AN CYCLOPS THAT WANTS TO EAT US ALL
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:47:02 lmao no one could catch up to my propeller fighter
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 10:47:20 well at least not in a way to destroy me
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:07:45 what
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:15:50 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:16:04 also bruh read your messages
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:31:22 why do i never get any scams in my dms
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:31:30 i just wanna troll scammers but they never dm me
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:35:26 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 11:36:42 that is safe
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:37:58 imma test my fighter of doom in pvp lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:50:50 my propeller fighter can go 500 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 09:06:49 No.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 09:25:19 that face is in my nightmares
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 11:25:57 imma leak plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 13:55:46 just talk
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 20:23:46 im assuming you are reffering to bfg-50
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 20:24:35 oh i was wrong
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 18:08:11 basically an magnet but without magnetic properties
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:37:59 i wanna make an seaplane hm
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:41:27 why would i
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:55:38 hm so what is the fastest drive in game right now?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:55:54 hm very interesting
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:58:56 yeah conveyor drive is somehow very fast
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:59:06 imma make a very speedy plaen
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:00:00 hm
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:02:48 well my conveyor drive is working and looking like an literal alien technology when flying
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:02:53 lack of speed though
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:05:25 well with max speed conveyor i went 2700
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:05:53 double of my old sr-71 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:06:24 i wonder if i can just add more conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:23:55 well my double conveyor drive plane is going only 700 more than the single drive plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:24:04 expected bigger speed change
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:26:06 that is weaker tho
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:26:24 i just need to add more conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:27:16 does the suspension damper increase the speed of the conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:27:45 3600
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:28:02 a lot of speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:28:09 almost 3900
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:28:23 nvm i got 3900
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:28:47 didn't ask tho
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:29:13 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:30:20 "if something is too slow, just add more engines"
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:30:30 greatest idea ever
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:32:36 "weak"
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:32:56 also that
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:33:46 because it is experimental aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:34:11 i wanna see what is the fastest speed i can reach
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:36:18 doubled my engine power
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:36:26 it got very wobbly very fast
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:36:50 there is only one way to fix that, i need to go even further beyond
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:38:11 im sure nothing bad will happen if i add another layer to my conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:39:00 it became so glitchy that i became invisible
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:39:40 invisibility cloak
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:40:17 im somehow dying but idk from what
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:40:46 im sure bigger tail is the solution
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:41:11 absolutely not
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:41:34 also its somehow going faster after i turned it off
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 18:42:05 bigger is not always the solution
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:00:36 i feel like adding more conveyor drives is not good
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:04:26 ping him so he gets online
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:05:48 sounds like skill issue tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:30:40 i wanna troll on pvp with my seemingly slow and bad plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:30:44 imma do it
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:33:02 what
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:33:19 shut up
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 08:39:51
