general 2023-04-12 15:20:59 Like im not joking qhen im saying tired and bias
general 2023-04-12 15:21:08 The bias is unreal and nerv racking
general 2023-04-12 15:21:13 Im losing it
general 2023-04-12 15:26:09 And worse of it all is that most of the players playing war thunder aint playing russia to begin with
general 2023-04-12 15:26:19 They playing germany and the usa
general 2023-04-12 15:27:23 So like why is germany, from all nations in war thunder so crippled at top tier, and no, dont say the radkampfwagen is good, it is fine, but lets not compare it to the adats and the pantsir
general 2023-04-12 15:31:47 The insanity
general 2023-04-12 15:32:58 Yo do now

general 2023-04-12 15:34:20 What? How?
general 2023-04-12 15:34:32 Most toxic human being on the planet
general 2023-04-12 15:34:39 Even the gulags dont want of you
general 2023-04-12 16:17:04 did they remove the chastle map in war thunder ground rb

general 2023-04-12 16:18:23 instead you have those snowy map nobody asked for
general 2023-04-12 16:18:25 epic
general 2023-04-12 16:19:50 yeah same
general 2023-04-12 16:20:56 a human reload either faster or justa bit slower than any other loader, only possible competition is from MODERN HORIZONTAL auto loaders
general 2023-04-12 16:21:11 russian auto loaders suck at best
general 2023-04-12 16:22:18 ok so do i need to tell you why even the french never tried to put a naval type auto loader like the soviets did in their tank
general 2023-04-12 16:22:25 are you are actually that brain dead
general 2023-04-12 16:22:57 it does
general 2023-04-12 16:23:02 it breaks often
general 2023-04-12 16:23:05 jams often
general 2023-04-12 16:23:17 the soviet vertical autoloader is far from the best
general 2023-04-12 16:23:23 it sucks
general 2023-04-12 16:23:40 it is more complex than a horizontal one
general 2023-04-12 16:23:46 you do realise that right
general 2023-04-12 16:24:49 it was fine in the 50's-60's considering the the loader back thenw ould get exhausted faster
general 2023-04-12 16:24:51 mostly
general 2023-04-12 16:24:58 for numerous reasons
general 2023-04-12 16:25:03 but now it is just
general 2023-04-12 16:25:08 incredibly shit
general 2023-04-12 16:25:29 the t-14 is even worse
general 2023-04-12 16:25:39 fr
general 2023-04-12 16:27:04 i didnt have to, i did but like i usually do i confirmed 90% of what he said in his video with my own research, even if only 50% of what he said wasnt true, you are still stuck with a garbage tank at best
general 2023-04-12 16:27:14 even if like 20% of everything he said
general 2023-04-12 16:27:16 was true
general 2023-04-12 16:27:19 imagine
general 2023-04-12 16:27:49 dude it uses a diesel electric engine
general 2023-04-12 16:27:55 can we cry
general 2023-04-12 16:30:40 ok it didnt break down but you miss the part they had another vehicle coming to tow it. also, im missing the part in which puting a diesel electric engine inside a tank, that was argueably proven by the germans to be a bad idea and ureliable, now is, because its russia in 2023, a better idea? like are you joking rn? also do i need to tell you that the armor profile on this thing is obviously orible?
general 2023-04-12 16:31:57 the thing is almost twice the volume of an abram
general 2023-04-12 16:31:59 LOL
general 2023-04-12 16:32:04 how to be a giant target
general 2023-04-12 16:32:08 a tutorial
general 2023-04-12 16:32:33 abram X is a prototype
general 2023-04-12 16:32:46 yes
general 2023-04-12 16:33:13 thats the exact problem you are facing with the t-14, it is a rushed design and it shows
general 2023-04-12 16:34:19 they didnt try to go about the actual design of the vehicle, and ask themselves if a giant box of metal twice the volume of the abram would be safer and cheaper
general 2023-04-12 16:34:22 spoiler
general 2023-04-12 16:34:24 i cannot be
general 2023-04-12 16:35:06 they probably all left russia for better salaries
general 2023-04-12 16:35:13 theres a brain drain in russia
general 2023-04-12 16:35:18 and thats no mistery
general 2023-04-12 16:35:28 the corruption is also insane
general 2023-04-12 16:36:06 how can you make a good vehicle in a state that corrupted to begin with. please explain your unicorn style explanation
general 2023-04-12 16:36:58 you are trying to avoid my question
general 2023-04-12 16:37:03 it isnt political
general 2023-04-12 16:37:34 the t14 cannot be a very good or that good vehicle to begin with, the corruption in russia is beyond bad
general 2023-04-12 16:37:39 thats no secret
general 2023-04-12 16:38:01 ive talked to some
general 2023-04-12 16:38:06 ive done my research
general 2023-04-12 16:38:11 always the same answers
general 2023-04-12 16:38:26 so either you come up with something to proves the oposite
general 2023-04-12 16:38:47 or stop denying the t14 isnt junk
general 2023-04-12 16:39:13 are you drunk?
general 2023-04-12 16:39:38 we talking about 20 to 40% of the military gdp going into... well we dont know actually
general 2023-04-12 16:39:41 it vanishes
general 2023-04-12 16:40:33 you are drunk, north korea is less corrupt than russia, do you get what corruption means
general 2023-04-12 16:40:58 not even the state itself runs the country
general 2023-04-12 16:42:05 yeah and it was a fancy way to deny that russia cannot innovate as much or anywhere close to what they could do before in those conditions
general 2023-04-12 16:43:14 it is still missinformation
general 2023-04-12 16:43:33 the t14 sucks
general 2023-04-12 16:43:38 there you have it
general 2023-04-12 16:44:12 fr
general 2023-04-12 16:47:54 fr then people will stop saying it is good
general 2023-04-12 16:49:10 people like <@702907851001167882> fall for it
general 2023-04-12 16:52:10 you claim it is good so lets put that to clear, only the russian propaganda claim so
general 2023-04-12 16:52:20 no one else
general 2023-04-12 16:52:25 not even the chinese
general 2023-04-12 16:55:56 it isnt going to change, at least their base production model if they have any GOOD INDUSTRICAL conventions, this means that the base t-14 that (they are reportedly already producing) is a production vehicle
general 2023-04-12 16:56:11 idk if you grasp anything of this
general 2023-04-12 16:57:30 who are you again ?

the-dump 2023-04-13 20:56:49 Su57 garbage, it has a bigger radar signature than a prop aircraft of the same size during ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:22 You are not asking right
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:29 You must be trying to argue rn
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:34 Its official
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:57:41 It is bad
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:28 Whay
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:30 Why
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:39 Bruh
the-dump 2023-04-13 20:59:48 Okay let me retype it just a sec
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:03:22 First thing:
They are stuck with 90's production line aircraft manifacturing, and european to add to that at best (very important) 

-europe never did their own actually stealthy jet fighter aircraft on a mass scale

-russia can GET THE PLANS from hacked files and stuff like the plans to know WHAT THEY NEED TO DO and the specifications of the very very very small margines of engineering contraints they would need to respect. Thing is, tthey dont have the manifacturing equipment for that
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:03:46 Simple
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:04:54 So like it doesnt matter if on paper the su-57 is good or not, irl its a fancy 4th gen jetfighter
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:05:30 Reality aint a video game
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:07:25 American planes with radars did have accounters with it and like i stated it had an horibbly big radar cross section
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:07:41 We talking detecting it before you can see it with anything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:02 They crashed a jet into a drone that cost half the price of said jet. You said?
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:30 Im pretty sure it was a su-57
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:48 Not like america is falling behind russia in anything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:09:59 If Anything the russian are better than the usa is corruption
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:10:03 And that they are epic at it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:10:45 Didnt state it was that accounter you dumb ass
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:00 I stated that russia flies their jet and do dangerous stuff with them all the time
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:15 Just the first time a crash like this is actually virale
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:11:46 Are you dumb
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:12:25 A plane is fragile that jet must have crashed too, they are so poor they are ready to waste it for a drone with 1980's tech. Wake tf up
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:12:50 Like bruh
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:03 Ik im like brain dead rn and cant type for shit
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:07 Slept 2h
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:13:25 Thats good for the scrap yard
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:14 Oh okay so because war thunder model of the aircraft is broken, and that idk a modern jet can fly with a single wing, you seriously think russia has great jets
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:22 When its 3 decades behind even china
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:14:28 Are you mentally challenge
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:22 The fuselage is compremised it was burned and detoriated its composition changed
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:27 They fixed it maybe
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:33 But the usa would NEVER
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:35 DO THAT
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:15:54 My idole
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:16:55 Tbh the warthog is shit too
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:17:04 And the usaf actually said so too
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:43 Like the only REASON why they keep operating them its that its a good cas aircraft if you have total control of the sky, which the usa with the biggest airforce in the wold by a large margine doesn't lack, otherwise, the warthog is slower than a late ww2 piston prop fighter
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:51 To say it sucks to begin with
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:18:56 Is a understatment
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:19:06 An helicopter does almost a better job
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:20:05 They dont, the friendly fire with the warthog was real bad (not as bad as some people pretend but still)
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:20:51 A plane was legit designed around that dumb ass gun
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:00 Thats the f problem with the warthog
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:10 The whole problem problem about it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:13 Is that
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:21:36 Canada
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:23:21 Yeah lets just say that you are incredibly stupid
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:23:30 Lets put it this way
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:24:06 Np
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:24:41 We use all short of junk added to most modern jet fighters thx our primister for that cluster f
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:25:04 No
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:20 We had our jet fighters a while back, but like many thing went south including the usa having much bigger compagnies so they crushed the competition instantly when they say we had very good jets coming out
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:38 <@750066581874147389> now you know why
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:54 And we produce weapons for other country then our own
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:26:57 Thats how stupid
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:00 This is
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:33 There was one that could go like mach 2 or some bs
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:27:49 From avro yes
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:24 It had a sub in canada
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:34 But were fairly disconected
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:49 It was because ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:28:57 It basically became its own thing slowly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:29:42 Thing is that canada was manifacturing power house after ww2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:15 Trudeau
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:19 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:30 -make canada indebt like anything else before
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:30:56 -fuck the military
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:31:46 We sent a good portions of our leopards 2
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:15 <:ch_politetea:782976917362966570>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:39 Again you play too much war thunder
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:32:58 It has a package just like the tusk one and actually
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:11 The leopard is much MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE MODULAR than the abram
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:24 Some abrams were lost too before
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:29 Thats a leopard 2a4
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:33 Not a 2a5
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:34 Also
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:41 Thatw as probably the turkish
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:46 They used some like shit
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:54 Infront of infantry in urban combat
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:33:58 It didnt go too well
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:02 Their bad
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:06 Not the tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:18 The abram is a tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:34:29 Thx for clarifying this to me
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:03 Much
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:07 MUCH BETTER
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:16 IT WAS DESIGNED from the ground up
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:24 To fight in those conditions
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:29 Unlike the abram
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:42 The abram is more like
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:50 Gasoline ungry
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:35:53 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:03 And need insane air coverage
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:39 Like i stated the leopard is much more modular than the abram, it is meant to be buyer friendly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:36:52 The swidish legit added like 49mm to the top of their tank
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:29 Top down attack on any thank that currently exist are deadly
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:32 Welcome irl
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:46 Most modern leopards have the trophy active protection system
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:37:57 And tusk equivalent and more package
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:03 Atgm wont touch it
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:47 Still waiting for it to be in the german tech tree in war thunder
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:53 It will be so broken
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:38:57 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:03 The leopard 2 pso is in the game filed thought
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:23 Meant for urban combat
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:40:29 Including a shorter barrel
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:00 
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:10 Feel the german steel
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:48 2010 pic so yes many 2a7+ are being and are produced already
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:43:59 It aint meant for urban combat thought
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:44:03 Unlike the PSO
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:44:20 
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:18 Yes
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:26 And turkey lost a bunch like morons
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:34 Used them as some short of wonder weapon
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:49 And trew them infront of everything
the-dump 2023-04-13 21:49:58 Into a very crowded city

general 2023-04-14 00:11:48 How to cripple your student motivation
general 2023-04-14 00:12:07 🗿
general 2023-04-14 00:14:35 Fun fact, the earliest school or "universities" (were mostly about philosophy back then) you could just enter and leave whenever you wanted
general 2023-04-14 00:14:38 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 00:14:51 There was no door
general 2023-04-14 00:14:54 So ya know
general 2023-04-14 00:17:26 Plato was against modern democracy or its principles because i state (in resume)
"Elections are great, but would you let the dumbest and most random person navigate your only boat?"
general 2023-04-14 00:17:35 He did mention a boat
general 2023-04-14 00:18:20 He was right
general 2023-04-14 00:19:02 Politics is too free only like very well educated people that have some GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF PHYLOSOPHY and PSYCHOLOGY should be allowed in politic
general 2023-04-14 00:19:06 Problem solved

general 2023-04-14 00:20:10 1!1!1+!!!!!
general 2023-04-14 00:20:17 You111!+++1!!!!1!
general 2023-04-14 00:24:07 Sadly plato was right until you understand that our society nowaday is entirely about work and no like anything else
general 2023-04-14 00:24:17 The greeks had it the oposite
general 2023-04-14 00:24:20 They had slaves
general 2023-04-14 00:24:22 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 00:24:34 Thing is that slavery is huuuhhhh
general 2023-04-14 00:24:40 Not the best idk
general 2023-04-14 00:26:51 They did everything back then
general 2023-04-14 00:27:15 You local shop owner could stop working to go talk about his opinion at the thingmabob
general 2023-04-14 00:27:22 For the entire day or a good portion
general 2023-04-14 00:27:26 Because he had a slave
general 2023-04-14 00:28:39 Was about to point that that it was probably like indirectly or directly forced yeah
general 2023-04-14 00:29:08 Like you can call it slavery until the dude wasnt able to get food and or was about to starve to death
general 2023-04-14 00:29:17 It is still slavery but
general 2023-04-14 00:29:19 Like
general 2023-04-14 00:29:33 Yeah
general 2023-04-14 00:30:27 Biggest naval battle in history happened before christ
general 2023-04-14 00:30:33 So stupid
general 2023-04-14 00:31:02 Like something like 3500 ships vs x number of ships
general 2023-04-14 00:31:11 Total manpower was ludicrous
general 2023-04-14 00:31:42 Both did that
general 2023-04-14 00:31:47 Was like the new meta
general 2023-04-14 00:31:49 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 00:32:17 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-04-14 00:32:21 Wait wait wait
general 2023-04-14 00:33:38 Was the persians vs the greeks
general 2023-04-14 00:34:28 Dude no
general 2023-04-14 00:34:40 There was a naval ingament in 480bc
general 2023-04-14 00:34:47 That saw 900 persian ships sunk
general 2023-04-14 00:34:57 And 300 greek ones
general 2023-04-14 00:35:01 Thing mabob
general 2023-04-14 00:35:33 "September 480 BCE. A fleet of 371 Greek ships defeated 600–900 Persian ships in this decisive battle off the coast of Athens. The high-end estimate of 1,271 ships involved is the largest number of ships involved in a single battle. Greek triremes typically had crews of about 200 men, and the smaller penteconters were each crewed by 50 oarsmen, yet the total number of personnel involved in the battle is uncertain."
general 2023-04-14 00:35:48 Biggest naval battle in history number of ships
general 2023-04-14 00:35:52 And pop ratio
general 2023-04-14 00:36:34 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 00:36:48 Was a decisive battle
general 2023-04-14 00:36:53 They lost because of that
general 2023-04-14 00:37:44 No not at sea but the greeks made autistic boat so sparta could board other ship so dumb spartan could be usefull at sea
general 2023-04-14 00:38:03 And they won somehow like that

general 2023-04-14 16:58:20 Theres something called center of mass and lift...
general 2023-04-14 16:59:49 Do 229 during ww2
general 2023-04-14 16:59:52 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 17:01:19 NASA recently or not too long ago explaining that they are still suprized that two brothers managed to make a stable flying wing, and a jet to add to it all in ww2
general 2023-04-14 17:01:22 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-14 17:01:26 The ho229
general 2023-04-14 17:01:34 Way ahead of its time
general 2023-04-14 17:01:44 Fr
general 2023-04-14 17:01:50 Needs computer
general 2023-04-14 17:01:57 The do229 needed only the pilot
general 2023-04-14 17:02:38 No
general 2023-04-14 17:02:42 The flying wing
general 2023-04-14 17:03:04 Ho
general 2023-04-14 17:03:10 Yeah mybad
general 2023-04-14 17:03:15 No
general 2023-04-14 17:03:23 You idiot the do 229 didnt exist
general 2023-04-14 17:11:11 the only reason why flying wings are only doing a coming back tlike now, and it will still take a good 20 years, it is that idk, most people wanted to stick to conventional designs
general 2023-04-14 17:11:33 but everything points out that a flying wing is better in every single way
general 2023-04-14 17:11:39 except getting out of tail spin
general 2023-04-14 17:11:52 you dont have a tail
general 2023-04-14 17:12:52 ok wanna play
general 2023-04-14 17:12:55 lets vc
general 2023-04-14 17:13:06 stfu
general 2023-04-14 17:13:11 war thunder never waits
general 2023-04-14 17:13:24 ewwww ps4 war thunder
general 2023-04-14 17:13:42 ok im officially now racist
general 2023-04-14 20:04:54 Today on bottom gear, we gonna strap some rocket boosters on a tuktuk and see how fast it can go
general 2023-04-14 20:12:51 Jeremy! The tuktuk has reached mach 1!
general 2023-04-14 20:21:13 Yes
general 2023-04-14 20:21:22 You either do a double rotor
general 2023-04-14 20:21:29 So you inverse the torque
general 2023-04-14 20:21:38 Or you go ahead and do a swash plate
general 2023-04-14 20:21:39 Or
general 2023-04-14 20:22:00 You do a double rotor but each have their own lift (so plates)

general 2023-04-15 15:40:31 I dont understand how the challenger 2 can fire APFSDS  with a rifled gun (just so you know, the point of having fins is destroyed if you have rifles, it also produce more drag because your sabot will be spinning and thus less less kenetic energy and so on)
general 2023-04-15 15:40:42 Well any tank could
general 2023-04-15 15:40:46 Thats not the point
general 2023-04-15 15:41:02 I just dont get how they went around the problem i just mentionned
general 2023-04-15 15:41:14 Maybe they just dont have fins

general 2023-04-15 16:21:04 I wanted to correct some small mistakes ive said in chat a few days ago, mainly about how the t-14 was bad. (After watching both lazerpig, redeffect perspectives on the matter and doing my own research)

- altrough around 50% of the video of lazerpig is mostly bias and made up information or overly exagerated informations, he got some stuff right. Like redeffect pointed out himself.

Lets begin with the obvious:
***size matters***
-the t-14 is mostly a by product of corruption like both redeffect and lazerpig pointed out. Compared to onlder platform, the t-14 bring minimalistic actual upgrades all things considered, most of its new feature could have been fitted into the old designs of their tanks and or adjusted so it could fit.
general 2023-04-15 16:21:39 Now it being much karger than idk the huge as abram isnt a good thing
general 2023-04-15 16:21:54 Actually it removes all the good things from all previous soviet mbt
general 2023-04-15 16:21:57 Their compact size
general 2023-04-15 16:22:53 If it can role out of the factory
general 2023-04-15 16:23:27 And not suffer from the lack of modern electronics like every single aircraft and tanks russia is building rn is suffering from
general 2023-04-15 16:23:33 Those are the two stong points
general 2023-04-15 16:23:54 And the only one you really need to say with certainty that the t-14 aint the best at all
general 2023-04-15 16:25:17 The t-14 design mightt have been good on papaer if nothing of what ive said was true
general 2023-04-15 16:25:38 But still, russia simply doesnt have the chips or hardware rn to make it like it should be
general 2023-04-15 16:25:41 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-15 16:25:47 So it doesnt matter
general 2023-04-15 16:26:33 (Russia always was 20-30 years behind the western world in chips manifacturing since the end of ww2)

general 2023-04-17 19:20:22 Ik it might have been a joke because his story was bad but its not that he attempted it on me, im 20 it is easy to spot, it is that he probably did that with kids here
general 2023-04-17 19:20:42 The way he went about it showed some experience
general 2023-04-17 19:20:50 Im just gonna say it like that
general 2023-04-17 19:21:29 So even if it was a joke (which he never said it was) its a extremely bad one at best
general 2023-04-17 19:23:08 I mean if he goes in people dm posting link and saying made up stories about (in my case it was bitcoin but he could have easily said robux) that he needs X number of robux and he will give me back double the amount

general 2023-04-18 11:43:25 Thats animation?
general 2023-04-18 11:43:42 Looks like it because the guns reload faster than the bullet goes out
general 2023-04-18 11:43:46 Which is well
general 2023-04-18 11:43:49 Impossible
general 2023-04-18 11:43:51 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-18 11:44:16 What creates the recoil?
general 2023-04-18 11:44:27 Do you understand how physics qork
general 2023-04-18 11:45:12 If you throw a ball very fast, you wont go the oposite direction as fast as the ball even in space
general 2023-04-18 11:45:33 That bullet is like 1/1000 of the gun mass
general 2023-04-18 11:45:49 Most of the energy goes into well
general 2023-04-18 11:45:53 The bullet
general 2023-04-18 11:45:55 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-18 11:45:59 Not the gun
general 2023-04-18 11:46:15 And that small amount that remains, you think, will make the gun go faster
general 2023-04-18 11:46:19 Than the bullet
general 2023-04-18 11:48:13 Ukraine do have some few jets

general 2023-04-18 12:23:30 like it was all in tags
general 2023-04-18 12:23:36 and they still ban me
general 2023-04-18 12:23:48 dude roblox is so stupid
general 2023-04-18 12:24:14 no
general 2023-04-18 13:42:21 You can use self propelled artillery, but cant use them correctly
general 2023-04-18 13:42:25 Like in wot
general 2023-04-18 13:44:15 Im fine seeing spg at the front lines, "tank destroyers" more importantly, but self propelled artillerie should get a new class ingame that allows them to have a top down view of the map and can aim on scouted target and spoted ones
general 2023-04-18 13:44:19 Wouldnt be too op
general 2023-04-18 13:44:26 Would be balanced in fact
general 2023-04-18 13:46:07 True but like that could add a feature to make self propelled artilery relevant in war thunder
general 2023-04-18 13:47:45 No i mean replace the artillery strike feature for all of them and replace it with an option to see the map from a top down view, you dont see enemies, you only cans ee the ines who have been either spoted or located, and you see them with markers not actual tanks
general 2023-04-18 13:47:52 Would be great
general 2023-04-18 13:49:18 Apparently there is a version of the puma coming withh atgm shoot and forget stuff (will be the most advanced atgm ingame)

general 2023-04-18 14:02:42 KMS*
general 2023-04-18 14:03:17 It was never reclacified as a uss ship thought
general 2023-04-18 14:03:37 It was used in nuclear test
general 2023-04-18 14:09:36 The reason why hms hood actually sunk:

-unlike the most common theory, the projectile probably didnt dive down into the hull, the distance didnt allow for such an angle to be achieved by the calibers of bismark, (as far as my memory goes) it would have entered one of the turret rings or some other ways because multiple survivors and crew of the prince of wales sighted the turret the closest to the explosion getting short of jam and smoke getting out of the gun barrels right before the explosion, we talking seconds so this wasnt as fast as the most common theory as stated before
general 2023-04-18 14:11:16 Thats what he said in his video
general 2023-04-18 14:11:32 Thats not how physics works
general 2023-04-18 14:11:51 Hood had a decent lower hull armor
general 2023-04-18 14:12:17 Right after the water line or bellow water litterally
general 2023-04-18 14:13:28 The most armored part was the lower armor
general 2023-04-18 14:13:35 He points it out in the video
general 2023-04-18 14:13:42 Yes i watched it a while back
general 2023-04-18 14:14:09 Thats how ships were design to survive torpedo strikes
general 2023-04-18 14:14:31 Dude you are not listening
general 2023-04-18 14:14:42 You got it wrong
general 2023-04-18 14:17:51 I get that you dont understand anything about physics
general 2023-04-18 14:18:54 Brb imma rewatch his take ill explain because no its impossible it went in a straight line after going trough 49 meters of water and then trought the most armored section of the ship
general 2023-04-18 14:19:40 It isnt in the slightest
general 2023-04-18 14:20:05 Just a sec can i watch the last part im doing it rn
general 2023-04-18 14:20:21 I was rewatching it
general 2023-04-18 14:27:52 Unlike anything that you stated, what he states it is that the shell traveled barrelly any water, landing at most likely around 3 meters (10 feet) from the ship, using the bow wave the reduce even more the amount of water it travelled
general 2023-04-18 14:28:12 Which 3 meter for a shell around 1 meter long
general 2023-04-18 14:28:14 Is nothing
general 2023-04-18 14:29:44 His theory didnt state that it traveled actually underwater , it barelly did so if at all
general 2023-04-18 14:29:55 Which is what he stated and i stated
general 2023-04-18 14:29:59 And you didnt understand
general 2023-04-18 14:30:24 Dude you drunk it went at most across 2 meters of water
general 2023-04-18 14:30:29 Like what
general 2023-04-18 14:30:50 He explains it
general 2023-04-18 14:31:02 Water slows down shells insanely fast
general 2023-04-18 14:31:05 Im just saying
general 2023-04-18 14:31:30 (From my memory)
general 2023-04-18 14:31:40 I did say it was from my memory
general 2023-04-18 14:32:00 I never said it was absolute
general 2023-04-18 14:32:10 Never did so
general 2023-04-18 14:32:16 You are being dence rn

general 2023-04-18 17:44:38 Yeah
general 2023-04-18 17:45:30 Nice
general 2023-04-18 17:48:10 For what
general 2023-04-19 19:04:10 You legit can just type it on google or find the link in the description of the roblox game
general 2023-04-19 19:04:18 How is that "hell"
general 2023-04-19 19:17:24 Considering that the average human adult male is 1.8 meters tall, that pic is bit kind
general 2023-04-19 19:17:50 The height of the armata is 3.3 meters
general 2023-04-19 19:18:02 Yes?
general 2023-04-19 19:20:17 <@734814695629783100> Okay sorry, I ment "1.7529999999... meters"
general 2023-04-19 19:20:51 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-19 19:20:55 So like
general 2023-04-19 19:20:57 1.8
general 2023-04-19 19:25:06 Yes
general 2023-04-19 19:25:27 Ok
general 2023-04-19 19:30:33 Also the armata has a bigger "silhouette" or profile than the abram, it doesnt help that people say armata modular = better, just so people understand, the abram is way more modular than the armata with probably beyond 30 version of the tank using the same hull but allowing for more composite armor, better hardware and so on (source taken from actual tankers report)

general 2023-04-20 12:34:09 The principle of communism isnt bad, it is that human nature will always make that someone will try to profit from a system and or well gain more than the others
general 2023-04-20 12:34:17 In communism this is especially bad
general 2023-04-20 12:34:25 Because it can break the entire system
general 2023-04-20 12:35:24 Ik i was explained how it came to be
general 2023-04-20 12:35:41 Communism is just an extreme and like anarcho capitalism cannot last forever
general 2023-04-20 12:35:46 Well communism died

general 2023-04-20 12:44:53 Actually one of the best fake tanks ive even seen
general 2023-04-20 12:45:34 Probably due to the fact that it is heavily inspired from german, italian and american armor designs
general 2023-04-20 12:48:04 More of a british design, with that italian/german frontal/turret size vibe and german hull
general 2023-04-20 12:48:48 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-20 12:48:51 Im so good

general 2023-04-20 12:58:45 found it
general 2023-04-20 13:02:41 so stupid played it like a few days ago for like 15 minutes, gmod is still full of them most random rp
general 2023-04-20 13:21:07 the hull is clearly inspired from the marder like i pointed out and someone else did
general 2023-04-20 13:21:34 and actually someone earlier pointed out the entire design was inspired from a german prototype
general 2023-04-20 13:21:50 so it is very likely it was going to be like the tam 2c
general 2023-04-20 13:21:57 which yes is german
general 2023-04-20 13:22:11 despite well the buyers being argentina

general 2023-04-21 15:14:42 Its a triangle made of ocmposite for a reason
general 2023-04-21 15:15:05 So shots get deviated at 90° towards the main armor

general 2023-04-21 16:30:53 is that fr
general 2023-04-21 16:32:27 i like how welded actually decrease your structural integrity <@711516970230612030> well it is better than anything else, except cast
general 2023-04-21 16:32:43 idk how you are supposed to surpass cast
general 2023-04-21 16:33:09 yeah
general 2023-04-21 16:33:11 basically
general 2023-04-21 16:33:16 thats the only downside
general 2023-04-21 16:33:24 otherwise casting is better
general 2023-04-21 16:33:27 in every
general 2023-04-21 16:33:28 single
general 2023-04-21 16:33:29 way
general 2023-04-21 16:34:32 becuase weldings can be strong but it will never be as stong as a uniform metal piece so what i mean
general 2023-04-21 16:34:38 it does the job
general 2023-04-21 16:34:44 welding good
general 2023-04-21 16:34:56 but lets not give it too much credit
general 2023-04-21 16:35:27 not if welded correctly
general 2023-04-21 16:35:45 wich in modern WESTERN mbt it is probably done by robots
general 2023-04-21 16:35:51 for russians ones idk
general 2023-04-21 16:35:54 cannot say
general 2023-04-21 16:36:00 never seen the welds
general 2023-04-21 16:36:55 im not going to a make 1h normal class in chat because i wont be done by 3pm but yeah its a 'good thing'
general 2023-04-21 16:37:05 welds in VERY VERY VERY SHORT RESUME
general 2023-04-21 16:37:16 needs to be smooth, uniform
general 2023-04-21 16:37:28 not to much material need to be welded
general 2023-04-21 16:37:42 otherwise it is both ugly and doesnt make a good weld
general 2023-04-21 16:38:02 RIVEETTTTSSS
general 2023-04-21 16:39:16 rivets are great for anything else than tanks
general 2023-04-21 16:39:20 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-21 16:40:04 the amount of skilled labour for a single tank
general 2023-04-21 16:40:42 probably does infact exist
general 2023-04-21 16:40:46 used in construction
general 2023-04-21 16:40:51 like bridges

general 2023-04-22 05:34:42 The casualties was a result of how incompetent their general staff are
general 2023-04-22 05:35:21 Dude germany won the battle of france versing a supperior force so (britain and france) in like a month

general 2023-04-24 15:07:22 If you play almost anything else you gonna find better
general 2023-04-24 15:07:36 Like flightpoint
general 2023-04-24 15:09:04 LeBron james
general 2023-04-24 15:09:50 Dude is really thinking that plane crazy better in some situation qhen the game hasnt updated in at least 4 years its physic engine
general 2023-04-24 15:10:35 Flightpoint is just better
general 2023-04-24 15:10:41 In every single way
general 2023-04-24 15:10:46 Cant compare them actually
general 2023-04-24 15:11:20 Cry harder its legit what limits plane crazy

general 2023-04-24 15:11:35 Im "listening"
general 2023-04-24 15:12:32 The community is small and they dont have that big of a player base compare to plane crazy, i think you are mixing two things like an idiot

general 2023-04-24 15:13:56 You can make it cpu
general 2023-04-24 15:14:18 If you have a good computer in the settings of the game you can make the physic be on you system
general 2023-04-24 15:14:23 Not the server
general 2023-04-24 15:14:56 Oh i get it
general 2023-04-24 15:15:21 Yeah qell in that regard yes plane crazy is more barebone than flightpoint

general 2023-04-24 15:15:46 Love you too

general 2023-04-24 17:51:42 And its not like it doesnt exist, it does
general 2023-04-24 17:51:51 Just roblox search system is absolutely shit
general 2023-04-24 17:57:20 Its not because it looks old thay it is shit, i really hate when devs and people think like thay, if you gonna chnage the look, at least keep its benefits for how easy it use and how versatile it is
general 2023-04-24 17:57:30 One of the reason why steam still looks like how it does
general 2023-04-24 17:57:41 Versatility
general 2023-04-24 17:58:05 Basically
general 2023-04-24 17:59:02 Simple, offers easily access to everything you need ui very simple, this indeed often lead to not so beautiful ui but oh boy the more i am using modern apps the more i dont give a shit about the fancy shit anymore
general 2023-04-24 17:59:54 Yeah but the search system was decent
general 2023-04-24 18:00:04 And did the job more than enough
general 2023-04-24 18:01:00 Now its on part with me trying to use google to search about the last time abram lincoln had a glass of milk while i have drank 6 beers
general 2023-04-24 18:03:12 One of my creation uses ride of the valkyries, it exist, because people can hear it, but if you legit type the exact name without the ui, you wont find it

general 2023-04-26 17:39:14 In plane crazy, it is too much to ask to have "flightpoint" or any other decent building game optimisation options like "being able to process the physics from your cpu"
general 2023-04-26 17:39:43 In plane crazy, you need to "motor lock" because of the absurd limitation of the game

general 2023-04-27 00:47:18 Dude all the crew is infront and it has less armor than anything else
general 2023-04-27 00:49:10 I like how you cropped everything else and dont compare it and actually do some test to see which hulls ahve the best frontal armor
general 2023-04-27 00:49:27 The armata will at sure fall short of evrything else
general 2023-04-27 00:51:58 I dont get that 1250mm, which is it? The front lower plate? If so does it actually take into account the angle?
general 2023-04-27 00:52:12 Probably does
general 2023-04-27 00:52:28 Thats bs
general 2023-04-27 00:52:54 Impossible you have thay much on the front of the vehicle idk if you get why
general 2023-04-27 00:53:11 Its a video game thought
general 2023-04-27 00:53:21 So ill give it the benefit of the doubt
general 2023-04-27 00:55:07 Yeah so you protect your crew but make the turret twice has big in volume with no armor and nothing to protect the ammo and use a carousel like previous soviet tanks

general 2023-04-27 04:37:03 How "good" it potentially is
general 2023-04-27 04:37:06 Also
general 2023-04-27 04:37:14 The a-10 is built like a tank
general 2023-04-27 04:37:53 No it uses jet engines
general 2023-04-27 04:38:14 Like not the type for very fast speed necessarily

general 2023-04-27 04:39:32 The a-10 is a cas aircraft when you have FULL CONTROL of the sky
general 2023-04-27 04:39:37 Otherwise irl it sucks

general 2023-04-27 04:47:12 Those pics you probably saw from a su25 withh a engine torn of a real, but what you missed is that the metal elgit partially melted, the fuselage did, so that plane was good for scrapt

general 2023-04-29 12:41:46 The game is not halfway done yet
general 2023-04-29 12:43:11 Like theres devs that report on their progress but very little but each time its big, you have devs that dont report at all but get it done, and you have devs that report everything around each months
general 2023-04-29 12:43:26 You know why theres no inbetween?

general 2023-04-30 02:25:39 Rockets need to accelerate, most rockets go faster than a  airgun thought even very slow ones because well they are rockets
general 2023-04-30 02:25:47 Just pointing out
general 2023-04-30 02:26:12 Dude is so cringe fr

general 2023-04-30 02:29:30 Airguns can be lethal,  abit like in the video game franchise "metro" but they do pack less punch than conventional ammo, need pumps and thus more often than not either a very fancy crancking system or a battery and a very loud compressor and a dangerously high pressure tank next to you fucking face when you use it
general 2023-04-30 02:31:06 Air guns do be "silencious" compared to conventional guns thought
general 2023-04-30 02:31:14 Altrough not like in the video games metro
general 2023-04-30 02:32:32 Less convinient because you still need tanks of it but now you cant recharge it, oh also now it is even more explosive!
general 2023-04-30 02:32:38 <:manly_smile:788087969658961951>
general 2023-04-30 02:35:05 Crazy amount of energy required limiting them for now at large platforms such as navy vessels, coil guns are much easier to pack into a gun
general 2023-04-30 02:35:27 But we still fall short of having good enough batteries for them to be actually "lethal"
general 2023-04-30 02:36:02 Do you realise you get shot at in a battle zone?
general 2023-04-30 02:36:21 Im just pointing out the major flaw of such a platform
general 2023-04-30 02:37:02 Shrappnel exist and now you cary the equivalent of multiple grenades 1 inch from your face
general 2023-04-30 02:37:15 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-04-30 02:41:27 Exactly
general 2023-04-30 02:42:35 I get that a co2 tanks dont blow up like bombs, but im pretty sure it will at least send it flying at ridiculous speed
general 2023-04-30 02:43:55 Somehow more dangerous than a mg42 without a safety
general 2023-04-30 02:44:27 The valve
general 2023-04-30 02:45:06 Unconventional amunitions rarely is a good idea
general 2023-04-30 02:46:02 Tbh, guns with explosive filled cartidges (like we have rn) will still be around 400 years from now, they can work anywhere even in space
general 2023-04-30 02:46:15 In storage, ammo can last for like what
general 2023-04-30 02:46:18 Centuries
general 2023-04-30 02:46:52 Lol
general 2023-04-30 02:46:59 Think about how a gun works

general 2023-04-30 02:47:06 Stop typing
general 2023-04-30 02:47:09 Read again
general 2023-04-30 02:47:14 You will find a flaw

general 2023-04-30 02:47:22 Read again yourself
general 2023-04-30 02:47:39 Theres already AIR IN THE CARTIDGE
general 2023-04-30 02:47:51 Yes lol
general 2023-04-30 02:48:28 How can you explain a bullet goes of from a cartidge if it is sealed shut?
general 2023-04-30 02:48:32 Just saying
general 2023-04-30 02:48:36 Theres a detonation
general 2023-04-30 02:49:32 Dude like they are sealed shut how would it not work imagine, if it didnt work it space it wouldnt work on earth either
general 2023-04-30 02:49:36 Way too fast
general 2023-04-30 02:50:03 The soviets did
general 2023-04-30 02:50:08 With a 30 mm gun
general 2023-04-30 02:50:11 Thing ma bob
general 2023-04-30 02:50:31 Its because its stupid
general 2023-04-30 02:51:02 Just saying that space battles will take place at like insane distance
general 2023-04-30 02:51:21 And it there is ever space carriers they will be for planetary assaults
general 2023-04-30 02:51:40 Normal guns will just not cut it
general 2023-04-30 02:51:43 Even today
general 2023-04-30 02:51:52 Wwll i mean its still a gun its just that
general 2023-04-30 02:52:54 Thing is bullets are slow in space terms
general 2023-04-30 02:52:57 Basically
general 2023-04-30 02:53:00 Like snails
general 2023-04-30 02:53:11 Easy to avoid and just pointing out
general 2023-04-30 02:53:25 In space you gonna detect those space ships easily asf
general 2023-04-30 02:53:44 Our stealth technology wouldnt work in space well lostly wouldnt
general 2023-04-30 02:55:47 In close combat you gonna see conventional weapons with normal cartidge evn in space battles, but thw second its about precision and long range forget about it
general 2023-04-30 02:56:06 Ik

general 2023-05-01 16:08:43 Rickje is going trought something irl for the past 3 months
general 2023-05-01 16:08:59 What it is we dont know
general 2023-05-01 16:09:57 Taking the fact that this is a tank featured in battlefied 2042
general 2023-05-01 16:10:06 So it is taking place 19 years from now
general 2023-05-01 16:10:16 The pen must be the same as current rounds
general 2023-05-01 16:10:33 The difference will be in the sound it makes when it fires
general 2023-05-01 16:10:56 Id like to have your source on how you gonna produce the energy required to get to that
general 2023-05-01 16:11:25 Like it is in 19 years
general 2023-05-01 16:14:43 At best in 19 years our batteries will be sufficiently conpact and cheap that we will be able to have "hybrid" design were a normal but way smaller diesel engine than current tanks (because it will only be a generator for short) will provide electricity to the tank electric motors, the batteries would be recharged with the surplus amount of electricity, this being stated, i would put the maximum amount of shots fire in a row by the tank at probably around 30
general 2023-05-01 16:15:13 Before the batteries THAT ARE ONLY THERE TO LET THE GUN BE ABLE TO FIRE drains completely
general 2023-05-01 16:15:27 And thats if the munition have 500/600mm of pen
general 2023-05-01 16:17:25 Read everything else you moron
general 2023-05-01 16:17:32 You werent there
general 2023-05-01 16:18:04 White name cant read everything else so they ask dumb questions
general 2023-05-01 16:19:15 A disel or a turbine engine cant provide enough power of a rail gun on a tank as of rn by itself, that is will direct courant no batteries involved
general 2023-05-01 16:20:28 Also we are contrained to universal laws such as ground pressures for our land vehicles, and we will always be, so going over 75t is getting you into the "danger zone of the german super heavy syndrome"
general 2023-05-01 16:21:17 So this being stated safest bet is that if any rail gun tank ever exist in the next decades, which i would be very suprised of, it would required some advance batteries
general 2023-05-01 16:21:34 And a onboard diesel generator
general 2023-05-01 16:28:37 On a positive side note, rail guns will make their way on us war ships at very least way sooner than on tanks, because idk if anyone noticed, by a ship is much bigger than a tank
general 2023-05-01 16:31:12 Will rail gun tanks eventually exist?

85% sure for those simple reason:

-much more stealthy, produces much less sound theoretically (if done properly)
-much smaller infrared signature

general 2023-05-01 16:40:09 Said much smaller
general 2023-05-01 16:41:29 Are you trying to compare the heat from a rail gun and a electric motor to a giant turbine engine and 130mm smoothbore gun
general 2023-05-01 16:41:33 You must be trolling
general 2023-05-01 16:42:37 Brekaing news! Thats not hoooowww thhiiiisss woorrkkk!
general 2023-05-01 16:44:25 You are mentality challenged
general 2023-05-01 16:45:02 It wont fire enough to be that significant and it is an easy problem to overcome
general 2023-05-01 16:45:39 Dude ive been in mechanical engineering
general 2023-05-01 16:45:53 For it to be a problem youd need at least 100rpm
general 2023-05-01 16:45:56 Wake up
general 2023-05-01 16:46:29 I didnt
general 2023-05-01 16:47:02 Just told you it would need a very fast rpm for it to be a significant problem
general 2023-05-01 16:47:11 Which on a fucking tnak it wont have
general 2023-05-01 16:47:38 Thats why i said thats not how this works
general 2023-05-01 16:47:48 I wanst comapring the cannons but you did
general 2023-05-01 16:47:51 Mr smart ass lol
general 2023-05-01 17:02:52 Perhaps you didnt read what i had said: 
In the future.
It is not because rn or in the next 3 decades it wont happen that it will never happen
general 2023-05-01 17:02:57 Thats a misconception
general 2023-05-01 17:10:38 Was me
general 2023-05-01 17:10:42 Problem?
general 2023-05-01 17:10:54 Im just built different

the-dump 2023-05-02 19:27:01 Stop another one of the blood vains in my head might blow up
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:27:16 So shit
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:13 How is that a fighter, how did a car compagny came about to make a space ship, tf
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:20 Originality -10
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:28:39 They look like clown cars
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:18 thats good
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:45 Everything else is like if i tried to build about good looking and fidnt even try when im already shit
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:52 No insult but it is bad
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:29:59 Even for my shit standard
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:28 Most future spaceship will msot likely feature much less colors than your spacecrafts, like in a lot of science fiction, for various reasons, the following mainly:

-theres no need to paint thermal tiles and anything that will be exposed to the atmospheric reentry tempereratures optained by a spacecraft
- despite certain surfaces not being exposed to those extreme temperature, most spacecraft are painted entirelly white or not at all and remain the color of their metal strucrture
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:49 This is due to the fact that well they are exposed to sun light
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:39:54 ALOT MORE THAN YOU AND ME
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:07 and any other color would absorb instead of reflect
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:11 Which aint the best
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:40:15 In a vacume
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:15 Conclusion: in the future we might see more dark, black grey ships, but then again they will most likely stick with this simple design for the color choices
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:25 For the reasons stated
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:39 So the dark tone would be the materials themselves
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:41:43 Not a paint
the-dump 2023-05-02 19:42:54 "Yesnt"
general 2023-05-03 12:24:55 Ahut up shut up shut up

general 2023-05-03 12:26:00 Relatable
general 2023-05-03 12:26:49 Why do that in scratch
general 2023-05-03 12:27:11 Idk looks like it
general 2023-05-03 12:27:19 Probably a clone of
general 2023-05-03 12:30:13 I do but like informatic is also getting more and more automatrd beyond human comprehension
general 2023-05-03 12:30:34 Making a hard enough alr subject into a super hard/life time understanding subject
general 2023-05-03 12:31:14 If i knew nothhing about coding and informatic id say it is easy
general 2023-05-03 12:31:15 Sadly
general 2023-05-03 12:31:23 Im not at that end of the curve
general 2023-05-03 12:31:37 Im in the bottom hill of dispair

general 2023-05-03 12:44:12 Me using a tactical nuke on civilians and realizing that most deaths are not instant:
general 2023-05-03 12:44:19 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-03 12:46:25 Id like to know what would have happened to civilization on a planet with 3-4 times the atmospheric pressure we have here but around the same gravity, like what type of insane creation they could have made fly like the one we see in the clip
general 2023-05-03 12:46:37 We can only dream sadly
general 2023-05-03 12:47:30 You dont need that much of anything at 3-4 atm
general 2023-05-03 12:47:45 Even if you use hydrogene the slightest bit would be enough
general 2023-05-03 12:48:19 You dont get what i said
general 2023-05-03 12:48:28 Atm is the outside
general 2023-05-03 12:48:34 Not the inside you whale
general 2023-05-03 12:48:48 That hydrogene wants to go UP
general 2023-05-03 12:48:54 the more of the outside gass
general 2023-05-03 12:49:00 The more it wants to go UP
general 2023-05-03 12:49:13 It forces it
general 2023-05-03 12:49:27 Is a fluid
general 2023-05-03 12:49:50 So airships in such an enviroment would require that much hydrogene
general 2023-05-03 12:49:56 At least to my knowledge
general 2023-05-03 12:50:10 Basically
general 2023-05-03 12:50:23 Like it would be insane
general 2023-05-03 12:50:37 Jets thought would be near impossible but not impossible
general 2023-05-03 12:50:40 Too much drag
general 2023-05-03 12:51:02 Me when my airship has bulkheads
general 2023-05-03 12:51:05 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-03 12:51:20 Gonna use aphe on the airship 3 km out
general 2023-05-03 12:51:23 FIRE!
general 2023-05-03 12:52:21 Tbh humans COULDNT survive in such environement but underwater scuba divers already do short of that
general 2023-05-03 12:52:36 The outtside pressure basixally well helps us breed
general 2023-05-03 12:52:42 So they breed like 2 atm
general 2023-05-03 12:52:45 2-3 atm
general 2023-05-03 12:52:51 To balance the outside pressure
general 2023-05-03 12:53:03 No need
general 2023-05-03 12:53:07 Like i explained
general 2023-05-03 12:53:20 The outside pressure will equalize
general 2023-05-03 12:54:32 Just that us we are made for a ratio of "1" (most spieces in the universe will probably be because who tf would breath a higher atm than theres is out side
general 2023-05-03 12:54:58 True
general 2023-05-03 12:55:44 Me about to ruin your whole career by going to eat silicon at silicon Valley
general 2023-05-03 12:55:46 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-03 12:56:03 You would have giant birds yes at 3-4 atm
general 2023-05-03 12:56:20 Some speculative evolution enthusiasts even say whale size animals
general 2023-05-03 12:57:09 30m of water is alot just gonna point out
general 2023-05-03 12:57:26 Yes
general 2023-05-03 12:57:59 Most planets that are habitable most likely have more dences atmosphere than ours
general 2023-05-03 12:58:17 Ours is very very well fine at best
general 2023-05-03 12:58:55 Like 1 atm is actually a crushing force if you saw any videos of a gas tank being depressurized too much
general 2023-05-03 12:59:13 But in the grand scheme of things
general 2023-05-03 12:59:17 1 atm is jack shit
general 2023-05-03 12:59:28 Tea
general 2023-05-03 12:59:31 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-03 12:59:43 Gonna satify those british
general 2023-05-03 13:00:23 Thats the opposite
general 2023-05-03 13:00:37 Like a actual train size gas tank
general 2023-05-03 13:00:42 Imploding
general 2023-05-03 13:01:57 Remove everything in a gas tank and at every square inch or so theres the equivalent of the weight of 3 mazda cars now
general 2023-05-03 13:02:06 Does that answer your question?
general 2023-05-03 13:04:38 What holds a presurized gas tank aint thhe metal, really isnt, its the inside pressure of the gas itself that is balancing stuff out with the outside
general 2023-05-03 13:06:31 Also <@200793484053970944> I wouldn't recommande actually depressurizing anything that is not meant for that
general 2023-05-03 13:06:52 Lol
general 2023-05-03 13:07:04 No shit
general 2023-05-03 13:07:09 Sherlock
general 2023-05-03 13:07:31 Ok "no it wouldnt"
general 2023-05-03 13:08:06 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-03 13:08:14 "UwU"
general 2023-05-03 13:09:17 I dont no i did all this in high scool
general 2023-05-03 13:09:44 Pressure chambers are usually small and if they are not they are EXTREMELY reinforced
general 2023-05-03 13:09:59 Or legit under a montain or some bs
general 2023-05-03 13:11:52 Pressure and PHYSICAL weight are two similar but different things
general 2023-05-03 13:11:58 Thats what people dont get
general 2023-05-03 13:12:03 With fluids
general 2023-05-03 13:13:19 YALL FAT JESUS
general 2023-05-03 13:13:53 1.45N/cm2 is alot of you think about it for 1 sec just pointing out
general 2023-05-03 13:15:16 Bs
general 2023-05-03 13:15:26 "On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square centimetre (cm2), measured from the mean (average) sea level to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a mass of about 1.03 kilogram and exerts a force or "weight" of about 10.1 newtons, resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm2 or 101 kN/m2 "
general 2023-05-03 13:15:41 101kn/m2
general 2023-05-03 13:15:46 Imagine
general 2023-05-03 13:16:58 Ik
general 2023-05-03 13:17:02 Been a while thought
general 2023-05-03 13:17:37 Explaining to scifalded that a depresurized gas tank would implode under our atmosphere
general 2023-05-03 13:18:48 Thats 530 on impact not constant you idiot
general 2023-05-03 13:19:00 Scifalded did you go in high-school
general 2023-05-03 13:19:18 Like why am i teaching him high-school  stuff the hell
general 2023-05-03 13:19:45 I DONT HAVE THEM WITH ME IVE DONE IT LIKE 3 YEARS AGO
general 2023-05-03 13:19:56 DO I LOOK LIKE A TEACHER ARRRGGGG
general 2023-05-03 13:20:39 yeah like if it has any purpose in anything in my life
general 2023-05-03 13:20:54 dude has no life
general 2023-05-03 13:21:02 so he doesnt forget those equations
general 2023-05-03 13:21:29 lol
general 2023-05-03 13:21:48 lets vc ill explain to you
general 2023-05-03 13:22:26 ITS A FLUID
general 2023-05-03 13:22:37 think about it like water
general 2023-05-03 13:22:41 litterally
general 2023-05-03 13:23:06 it is also a fluid
general 2023-05-03 13:23:13 by definition
general 2023-05-03 13:23:16 gas is a fluid
general 2023-05-03 13:23:30 they are like subs
general 2023-05-03 13:24:05 if the pressure chamber is made resistant enough yes
general 2023-05-03 13:24:10 like anything else
general 2023-05-03 13:24:51 theres videos on youtube dude just type it, legit train gas tanks implodes sometimes
general 2023-05-03 13:25:02 well rarelly
general 2023-05-03 13:25:06 but it happens
general 2023-05-03 19:15:14 Around 100kph ++
general 2023-05-03 19:15:54 With the distance id put it at 150kph easy
general 2023-05-03 19:18:42 Also im just gonna point this out but who ever was that driver, they are dead
general 2023-05-03 19:23:24 I really dont get who ever placed those laughing emoji on top of a very fatale car crash scene but some people are disconnected from reality until they have a stroke in their late years while they drive and get themselves into something so bad they are stuck to a wheel chair the rest of their days themselves
general 2023-05-04 05:45:21 Looks like a fucking battle plan
general 2023-05-04 05:46:26 what??

general 2023-05-04 13:21:52 Do you know anything about ships designs?
general 2023-05-04 13:22:13 Thats a battlecruiser
general 2023-05-04 13:22:18 Not a battlehsip you dumb f
general 2023-05-04 13:22:23 Aint the same thing
general 2023-05-04 13:22:57 100% is the main reason, wouldnt be enough room and or the ship cant support it
general 2023-05-04 13:22:59 The end
general 2023-05-04 13:23:01 Cry about it
general 2023-05-04 13:24:01 Basically you think knowing a subject better than 10k engineers that worked on this ship
general 2023-05-04 13:24:04 I see
general 2023-05-04 13:24:12 Let me put this straight

general 2023-05-04 13:27:30 Clearly
general 2023-05-04 13:33:40 Navals guns were quite accurate both during ww1 and ww2, both used two different system and 1 had some significant draw backs but it worked as well as the second one

general 2023-05-04 17:14:52 He is the litteral definition of re you know
general 2023-05-04 17:15:38 Light battleship at best
general 2023-05-04 17:16:10 Okay that makes sense
general 2023-05-04 17:16:35 Thats why its well that design and size while still being a battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:18:05 Wouldnt it still fit the battlecruiser familly
general 2023-05-04 17:18:08 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-04 17:18:17 Despite the russians calling it a battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:19:14 Its more about the armor and armement
general 2023-05-04 17:19:18 Not the speed
general 2023-05-04 17:19:34 Otherwise its more a coastal defence ship
general 2023-05-04 17:20:58 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-04 17:21:11 So calling it a battleship is a stretch itself
general 2023-05-04 17:21:30 Which it could barelly fill the role
general 2023-05-04 17:21:53 Fart

general 2023-05-04 17:24:30 Not turret
general 2023-05-04 17:25:01 I think the ship itself is shit after more considerations
general 2023-05-04 17:25:20 Yeah
general 2023-05-04 17:27:48 Lol

general 2023-05-04 17:32:56 They litterally are
general 2023-05-04 17:33:04 Slightly less armored battleship
general 2023-05-04 17:33:05 For speed
general 2023-05-04 17:36:41 Battlecruisser = slightly less armored battlship + more speed

general 2023-05-08 13:19:03 Arrrgggg
general 2023-05-08 13:19:05 Jk
general 2023-05-08 13:19:17 Wait fr
general 2023-05-08 13:19:21 You chinese
general 2023-05-08 13:20:02 Yeah and me my GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GRAND FATHER WAS A NATIVE AMERICAN
general 2023-05-08 15:02:20 I like how that cages they put on the top of tanks that look "modern" are 20+ years old outdated ever since tandem warheads heat exist
general 2023-05-08 15:02:36 Like it doesnt prevent anything
general 2023-05-08 15:03:25 Wont do shit
general 2023-05-08 15:04:05 Yeah the thingmabob on top of some russian tanks at the start of the war
general 2023-05-08 15:04:26 Like grenades wont already damage the top of your tank
general 2023-05-08 15:04:30 They are pointless
general 2023-05-08 15:04:51 Dont think they are a thing
general 2023-05-08 15:05:09 Youd need a powerfull ass drone to lift that up
general 2023-05-08 15:05:26 Let alone drop it with precision
general 2023-05-08 15:06:21 Never seen it no videos of it, rpg7 war heads can only be activated once fires so youd need to modify them
general 2023-05-08 15:06:25 If im correct
general 2023-05-08 15:06:57 Ok but modifying a war head aint easy mr
general 2023-05-08 15:08:08 Also tpg7 are probably too valuable for them to do that shit, i think that the russians WERE EXPECTING the Ukrainians to do something like that
general 2023-05-08 15:11:08 perhaps
general 2023-05-08 15:12:09 it still doesnt fully work imma join point it out
general 2023-05-08 15:12:22 so ever if its true it sucks
general 2023-05-08 15:14:32 dude no you dont get out of a russian tanks
general 2023-05-08 15:14:54 if it actually gets hit irl yall dead most of the time
general 2023-05-08 15:15:11 giant gaps inbetween the metal struts
general 2023-05-08 15:17:24 ok are you Hight or something? its not a video games, very rarely the tank will be shot at the back and if it is, its indeed the only way the crew survives, the cannon is loaded with two stage ammunition inside a vertical ammunition carrousel
general 2023-05-08 15:17:36 like imma point it out now
general 2023-05-08 15:17:41 russian tanks aint the best
general 2023-05-08 15:17:43 welcome irl
general 2023-05-08 15:17:59 i hope so
general 2023-05-08 15:18:53 You clearly never seen ammo getting hit by shrapnel
general 2023-05-08 15:19:07 It blows up 99% of the time
general 2023-05-08 15:19:46 The fucking propellent is all over the tank idiot
general 2023-05-08 15:19:55 Shrapnel will hit it
general 2023-05-08 15:21:11 They are both vertical it is just that for whatever reason the t80/t64 and t90/t72 use different vertical autoloaders
general 2023-05-08 15:21:45 Horizontal autoloaders ar efound as of rn in french tanks, japanese ones and if im correct korean ones
general 2023-05-08 15:22:30 Austria has their own tanks?
general 2023-05-08 15:22:50 Oh yeah
general 2023-05-08 15:22:56 Well its french
general 2023-05-08 15:23:12 Modified by the austrian i suppose
general 2023-05-08 15:23:18 Yeah
general 2023-05-08 15:23:56 Horizontal autoloader are just way simpler and better than vertical ones in tanks
general 2023-05-08 15:24:09 Altrough they make usually the turret slightly bigger
general 2023-05-08 15:24:54 That vs a single piston that pushes ammo inside gun
general 2023-05-08 15:29:04 Im not
general 2023-05-08 15:29:15 I think you are just living in a cave
general 2023-05-08 15:29:19 And love putin alot
general 2023-05-08 15:29:50 Like DUDE VERTICAL AUTOLOADERS ARE GOOD ONLY FOR STATIC DEFRENCES AND SHIPS
general 2023-05-08 15:29:53 HELLLLOOOO
general 2023-05-08 15:31:37 Its not an opinion dude, look any other tank design even chinese ones they are getting away slowly from vertical autoloaders, you are the bias one not me
general 2023-05-08 15:31:43 Russian tanks have good things
general 2023-05-08 15:31:48 The autoloader aint one
general 2023-05-08 15:31:51 Thats for sure
general 2023-05-08 15:32:20 Dude it can lift a 2 ton turret 100 meters into the air, are you drunk?
general 2023-05-08 15:32:24 They gonna die anyway
general 2023-05-08 15:32:39 Dude listen to russian propaganda too much
general 2023-05-08 15:32:43 He is bias af
general 2023-05-08 15:33:17 The armata has a bigger gun and thus more propellant charges per ammo just pointing out fool
general 2023-05-08 15:33:28 Actual russian bias listening to propaganda
general 2023-05-08 15:33:50 Its supposed to be upgraded with a better gun
general 2023-05-08 15:33:59 At least thats what they want
general 2023-05-08 15:34:26 Still has more propellant charges because higher velocity
general 2023-05-08 15:34:46 It has more pen so it has to go around it somehow
general 2023-05-08 15:35:33 If you have ammo rack on the t-14 the crew gonna die 100%
general 2023-05-08 15:35:45 Aint so way a 20mm sheet of metal protect them from that
general 2023-05-08 15:37:26 I like how <@702907851001167882> thinks im bias when im just pointing out that the autoloader of russian mbt are holding them back and the absolute shit reverse, otherwise the profile of russian mbt is wonderful
general 2023-05-08 15:38:00 Like im not gonna start and say that russian tanks are great when their litteral insides are outtdated
general 2023-05-08 15:38:20 True
general 2023-05-08 15:41:40 the soviet would have an upper hand, if the people in the soviet union didnt starve to death to begin with and actual innovation was possible without stealing everything american
general 2023-05-08 15:42:25 lol
general 2023-05-08 17:14:38 School hates you
general 2023-05-08 17:18:05 I have dementia
general 2023-05-08 17:19:13 Help
the-dump 2023-05-08 17:31:05 
general 2023-05-08 18:40:50 Everything is backroom at this point
general 2023-05-08 20:25:46 Is dat optimus primus?
general 2023-05-08 20:35:54 Ok i care
general 2023-05-08 22:41:37 Who?
general 2023-05-08 22:41:55 Okay
general 2023-05-08 22:46:06 The tiger 2 had some major flaws, first off, by the point the production first started, the metal production and quality of germany was vanquished to the title of shit, so the tiger 2, depaite having a really good armor scheme, couldnt take much of a beating exactly like the tiger 1, altrough not for the same reasons. It goes without saying that the tiger 1 engine was fine on the tiger 1 "at best", but when you place it inside the tiger 2 you get some new problems such as very under powered and somewhat low "torque" but all this was the least of its problems. The first tanks being produced in later 1944/early 1945 it goes without saying that the production lines for the new tiger were horrible
general 2023-05-08 22:48:55 Around 110k universal carriers were built from around 1934 to 1960, they were the main infantry mechanized infantry vehicle of the british during ww2, altrough the jeep from the americans were made in greater numbers, the british still prefered to use their tracked box in most situations. In a great number of movies it can be found.
general 2023-05-08 22:54:44 Altrough the germans were late to the party in terms of mass produced machine pistols and co like the mp40, the stg44 was a game changer, featuring an intermidiate cartridge, an inbetween between a pistol one and a full size one from a rifle, the stg44 was easy to use, aim and shoot with accuracy at full auto, while still having a great amount of power, a powerful package that changed the world.
general 2023-05-08 22:54:49 <@1051956323950002206>
general 2023-05-08 22:56:11 They didnt produce anywhere close to what the allies fielded for their armies
general 2023-05-08 22:56:19 Any machine pistol for that fact
general 2023-05-08 22:56:25 Including the stg44
general 2023-05-08 22:58:38 Thats not how it went
general 2023-05-08 22:58:53 Ww1 and ww2 featured that problem
general 2023-05-08 22:59:00 Riffles aint that great
general 2023-05-08 22:59:07 Especially the german one by ww2
general 2023-05-08 22:59:10 Was outdated
general 2023-05-08 22:59:14 To add to problems
general 2023-05-08 22:59:48 Dude america had a semi auto one
general 2023-05-08 22:59:50 It was
general 2023-05-08 22:59:55 And they produced more
general 2023-05-08 23:01:01 1936–1975 (as U.S. Army sniper rifle
general 2023-05-08 23:01:15 It wasnt their main infantry man weapon no
general 2023-05-08 23:01:33 Dont be a wearhaboo
general 2023-05-08 23:03:03 They were, you either feilded you army with alot of machine pistols, like the soviets, which produced from 3 million to 6, or you fielded your army with a great deal of semi automatic riffles like the garand
general 2023-05-08 23:03:24 The germans were outtmatched by the allies by 1943
general 2023-05-08 23:03:29 To simply put it
general 2023-05-08 23:04:39 I think that you are focusing too much on the british when they had a more minor role in all of this than you think
general 2023-05-08 23:05:29 The british alone had no chance against germany
general 2023-05-08 23:05:35 Just gonna point it out now
general 2023-05-08 23:06:18 Its not because they do it
general 2023-05-08 23:06:23 That it is good
general 2023-05-08 23:06:28 Thx for understanding
general 2023-05-08 23:06:35 It wasnt
general 2023-05-08 23:06:49 The riffle was OKAY at best
general 2023-05-08 23:07:06 But mp and semi automatic riffle were much better
general 2023-05-08 23:07:22 Its easy to produce
general 2023-05-08 23:07:31 Germany aint america or the soviet union
general 2023-05-08 23:07:35 The uk aint america
general 2023-05-08 23:08:55 Ok are you a wehraboo or you gonna accept that a riffle that you need to hand reload each time you fire vs anything that is automatic is shit
general 2023-05-08 23:09:44 Still need to aim again
general 2023-05-08 23:09:49 Aint a video game
general 2023-05-08 23:09:59 Which you didnt have to with a garand and mp
general 2023-05-08 23:10:05 Dude ask actual historians
general 2023-05-08 23:10:15 By 1943 the german infantry was suffering
general 2023-05-08 23:10:20 Which leas to the stg44
general 2023-05-08 23:10:36 But thats short of a wonderweapon by that point
general 2023-05-08 23:11:16 Search it up
general 2023-05-08 23:11:28 You fire like 2 to 3 times more rounds with garand
general 2023-05-08 23:11:34 While still aiming
general 2023-05-08 23:11:42 Which is indeed a game changer
general 2023-05-08 23:14:45 1. You can fire 8 rounds in the time it take to fire 1 bullet and bolt another round with the kar98
2. 8 round magazine vs 5 rounds
3. Garand is still accurate as shit even at hundreds of yards, kar 98 is accurate but rate of fire is significantly decreased
4. Garand excels in urban and close quarters because if you miss with 1 round, it's ok cause you have 7 more than can be fired off.
5. Especially in close quarters the stress of having to land you bolt action kar98 shot is enough to cause a miss.... meanwhile m1 garand users experience no stress from missed shots because there is no down time to bolt a new round between shots.
general 2023-05-08 23:17:42 <@1051956323950002206> altrough all of this seems bad the Gewehr 43 was a thing, but still too few were made
general 2023-05-08 23:18:08 Shit arguements
general 2023-05-08 23:18:34 German troops never used scopes on their kar98k
general 2023-05-08 23:18:39 Bruh the hell
general 2023-05-08 23:19:12 Have you seen how fast it is to push your finger up and down
general 2023-05-08 23:19:23 Or you are trolling and a werahboo
general 2023-05-08 23:20:34 Dude in combat during ww2 it litterally was

general 2023-05-08 23:21:56 You are just stupid dont dont wanna learn
general 2023-05-08 23:22:44 The entire german platoon revolved around the mg squad or 3 man crew, why? So it could DUMP LEAD INTO THE FIELD
general 2023-05-08 23:22:51 THE REST OF THE TROOPS WAS SUPPORT
general 2023-05-08 23:22:55 helllooooo

general 2023-05-08 23:24:47 Am i doing that? No but you are at the moment
general 2023-05-08 23:25:49 It was okay until 1943 like i stated, at which point it yes became critically shit
general 2023-05-08 23:26:48 It legit was made prior to ww1, no way sherlock
general 2023-05-08 23:28:05 Sniper riffle

general 2023-05-08 23:32:40 You are the definition of stupidity, you keep getting off track and im about to vomit because your roller coaster doesnt make any sense
general 2023-05-08 23:32:58 I said the kar98k was outdated by 1943
general 2023-05-08 23:33:00 And it was
general 2023-05-08 23:33:03 The end
general 2023-05-08 23:33:58 Short of yes, shotguns were really used in ww2 thought
general 2023-05-08 23:34:09 Automatic weapons were much better

general 2023-05-08 23:38:23 During ww1 it was proven time and time again youc ouldnt hit anythinga t more than 1km down range with the kar98k and most riffles for that matter
general 2023-05-08 23:38:45 So this mean your actual ingagement is gonna take place at shorter range than 1km
general 2023-05-08 23:39:35 For main infantry weapons yes they were
general 2023-05-08 23:39:38 Dude
general 2023-05-08 23:42:16 They were used by the german army as their main weapon, ok let me recap for you okay? By 1943, the german army was mainly fielding kar98k to its troops when they were mainly facing automatic weapons making it actually shit in the circumstances of ww2 like i stated 1 trillion times

5. Especially in close quarters the stress of having to land you bolt action kar98 shot is enough to cause a miss.... meanwhile m1 garand users experience no stress from missed shots because there is no down time to bolt a new round between shots.

general 2023-05-11 20:58:22 Me when i join pcc general:
general 2023-05-11 21:00:18 i shot down a f-16a in tank rb with my bf109 k4 yesterday.
like this is so bad i was trying to sneek toward helis not killing a f-16A LOL 
he actually tried to dogfight me just a heads up.
first, he shot at me some aim 9 thingmabob probably, thing is that i am a prop, and idk if you guys noticed, but the heat signature of a prop going 600kph aint gonna be very high. so every single one missed me and i wasnt even aware yet he was there LOL so i wasnt even trying to avoid them.
second he tried to turn fight me.
final mistake, he did the cobra.

general 2023-05-11 21:19:49 The t90 is litterally a "wish" version of the t80
general 2023-05-11 21:20:03 A cheaper version with cutted corners everywhere
general 2023-05-11 21:20:33 T80 fairs much better at least the t80u and above

general 2023-05-11 21:24:37 Your mom?

general 2023-05-11 21:27:35 So re
general 2023-05-11 21:28:21 At 11 i was watching some minecraft youtubers
general 2023-05-11 21:28:34 Him: DOX RANDOM PERSON ON INTERNET FOR NO GAINS
general 2023-05-11 21:30:27 At 11 if you are doing that stuff it is either 2 things, VERY bad influence or you are very deprived of positive social interactions of any kind that you are constantly seeking attention
general 2023-05-11 21:30:48 Theres no inbetween
general 2023-05-11 21:31:47 Isnt it clear? Bad influence ≠ deprived of positive social interactions
general 2023-05-11 21:31:50 Just saying
general 2023-05-11 21:31:56 Do i need to explain it to you
general 2023-05-11 21:32:51 If he lacks positive social interactions, like i said, he gonna seek attention
general 2023-05-11 21:33:12 Not necessarily
general 2023-05-11 21:33:24 Its either 1 of those or both
general 2023-05-11 21:33:36 I give you that
general 2023-05-11 21:33:40 Both can be it
general 2023-05-11 21:38:24 Its unavoidable that a good % of future kid are going to have a decent part of their culture just be that, the internet, so indeed it is important to make it safer (not REMOVING STUFF) but safer and thats what they are doing
general 2023-05-11 21:39:17 You can swear
general 2023-05-11 21:39:38 They might just not monitize you
general 2023-05-11 21:39:49 Well look
general 2023-05-11 21:40:14 Idk if you are too young for this but it seems like it but tv had no swearing and still doesnt
general 2023-05-11 21:40:23 Until you get into a show or thats stuff
general 2023-05-11 21:40:33 But regular programs no swearing
general 2023-05-11 21:40:37 And thats the thing
general 2023-05-11 21:40:59 the people PAYING youtubers are the same who PAID the tv compagnies
general 2023-05-11 21:41:30 So just gonna point out that swears narrows your audience and does bad publicity
general 2023-05-11 21:42:42 Pretty sure tv compagnies did very little income from those
general 2023-05-11 21:42:50 Thats the thing
general 2023-05-11 21:43:18 Money
general 2023-05-11 21:43:34 Is what rules, not what we want but what they want
general 2023-05-11 21:43:57 In the end if it doesnt give them money f it
general 2023-05-11 21:44:02 Aint stonk

general 2023-05-13 21:09:33 Oh great, it's you again, Rickje139, claiming to be working on Plane Crazy 2. It's no secret that the community despises you. I can't fathom why people still believe in the existence of Plane Crazy 2, especially when the last leak you posted was a year ago. It's mind-boggling that you can't even utilize the built-in free terrain generator to expand the map, a task that takes a measly 20 seconds. And let's not forget that it's been days since you were last online, leaving the community in the dark with almost no updates about Plane Crazy 2. It's no wonder you're reluctant to communicate with your development team.

But here's the kicker: a 13-year-old content creator managed to whip up a superior game with a far better building system in just a few months. Imagine that! The latest announcement about Plane Crazy 2 was nothing more than a query about the size of train tracks. Pathetic, really. Your game is so fragile that even a simple Roblox update can cause it to crash just by touching water. Your laziness knows no bounds. You won't even bother implementing features that you've already created.

And let's not forget the fact that you can't even copy and paste the old winter map for the annual winter event. Plane Crazy 2's release has already been delayed by a year, and yet there's no sign of the promised 75% completion of the code rewrite that you mentioned two years ago. I'm genuinely surprised that you still manage to attract 2,000 players. They must have incredibly low standards.

general 2023-05-14 09:08:31 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-14 09:08:52 No but when it is fired

general 2023-05-14 11:29:38 I will forever remember the 1600m/s2 missile
general 2023-05-14 11:30:00 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2023-05-14 11:30:58 More g than anything else in  the solar system can exert
general 2023-05-14 11:31:09 The strongest missile ever
general 2023-05-14 11:34:04 Dude consider this, a missile with 1600m/s2 would reach escape velocity in less than 8 seconds
general 2023-05-14 11:34:53 Wouldn't be even halfway thought the atmosphere yet
general 2023-05-14 11:35:01 Thats some ksp stuff right there
general 2023-05-14 11:38:27 Although space guns are much cooler
general 2023-05-14 11:38:35 Canada built one in 70's
general 2023-05-14 11:38:44 Send stuff into space but not orbite
general 2023-05-14 11:39:10 (So very far from escape velocity)
general 2023-05-14 11:40:55 (Because ya know, when you produce so much drag that you lose about half your kinetic energy just to cross the first few kilometers of atmosphere, ya need to go even faster
general 2023-05-14 11:41:02 Which require more speed
general 2023-05-14 11:41:35 Which brings you into the fucking problem the university of mcgill was trying to assert with its stupid space gun
general 2023-05-14 11:41:44 3-4 stage ammo
general 2023-05-14 11:42:29 Bretta poggers

the-dump 2023-05-14 17:56:10 Oooohhh no you just didn't mentioned it was related to the titanic
the-dump 2023-05-14 17:56:36 Aint my fault if you didnt bother justify what those debris actual where
the-dump 2023-05-14 17:57:37 Ive read everything already you were just very unclear
the-dump 2023-05-14 18:00:23 Imma just point out it could have been anything else
the-dump 2023-05-14 18:03:10 You started by the end, went to the start and filled the middle after
the-dump 2023-05-14 18:03:26 How to not explain something
the-dump 2023-05-14 18:04:00 Some people actually argue about how to titanic sank
the-dump 2023-05-14 18:04:36 It is re
general 2023-05-14 18:25:13 Me explaining to russianraboos that having all that propellant in a circle under the ass of the crew aint the best
general 2023-05-14 18:25:26 "Darn it reality aint like war thunder"
general 2023-05-14 18:25:31 So sad huh
general 2023-05-14 18:25:34 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-14 18:29:38 I like how the wagner group is pulling out cuz putin is just that bad, wait no not just putin, THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN ARMY IS SO TRASH most of wagner group died!
general 2023-05-14 18:29:43 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2023-05-14 18:33:33 Yeah saw that they had to legit "manipulate" the gouverment or like do an ultimatum to the russian gouverments because of how bad the supplies they were getting
general 2023-05-14 18:34:15 Yeah totally that victory parade didnt just show that russia was lacking of everything
general 2023-05-14 18:34:38 Also it aint just a western media thing. The chief of wagner did it live
general 2023-05-14 18:34:44 Aint hard to confirm
general 2023-05-14 18:38:25 "The leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group says he will withdraw his troops from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on 10 May because of ammunition shortages." 

Not even 3 days after 

"The leader of Russia's paramilitary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that he had received "a promise" of more ammunition from the Russian army on Sunday, following his unprecedented public threat to pull his forces from the embattled Ukrainian town of Bakhmut due to a lack of ammunition."

He had to fucking threaten live on tv the russian gouverment indirectly to receive supplies
general 2023-05-14 18:42:33 Tf lol
general 2023-05-14 18:42:48 They cant even stop tractors from stralimg their tanks
general 2023-05-14 18:43:38 Very often
general 2023-05-14 18:44:47 Russian crews and soldiers are defenitly under trained
general 2023-05-14 18:45:13 Like that stuff happens to any nation
general 2023-05-14 18:45:25 But russia is weirdly enough the best at it
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:06:17 No he aint
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:06:24 Theres no other devs than him
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:06:51 The dev of mecanica at least when he got suggested to work for him said he was the only one
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:08:19 Its great to assume but we never heard about a single one of them
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:08:44 It fits the definition thought
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:08:47 No offence
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:09:08 Thats the thing
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:10:04 Why work on a project on which the lead dev doesnt even know what he wants
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:10:28 -Taken from the sayings from the dev of mechanica
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:12:07 Tbh that we didnt hear ANYTHING NOT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST about the game tells alot
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:12:23 This aint a tripple A game
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:12:54 So id be very surprise if there was actually anyone else than him and perhaps madattack
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:13:19 Basically
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:13:29 No proof of actually any work done
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:13:32 In fact
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:16:40 If you ever played any of the previous madattack gaems, which some are no longer there, you will realise very fast that plane crazy was supposed to be only a proof of concept, at least it features the exact same vibe as the other games that were aiming for that, and that ain't a new thing, i'm pretty sure most games on roblox are atemps by people, furthermore madattack has posted on twitter his progress on what seems to be a new innovation lab game
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:16:58 He really
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:17:10 Really doesn't care about plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:18:51 Idk if you saw qhat madattak can do but if he was actually coding pc or pc2 it would be out rn
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:18:55 Since 2 years
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:20:39 Doing is another
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:20:39 Saying is one thing
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:21:42 If he actually has any devs because rn they are more secret than soviet spies
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:23:19 Which i mean, look pc2 is a video game, not the manatham project
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:23:43 So why nobody as ever claimed in the slightest to be working with rickje
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:23:46 If anything
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 19:23:54 Wut

general 2023-05-15 02:21:11 She 100% aint
general 2023-05-15 02:22:53 Using drug money to pay the debts of someone you slept with in the back of your husband, oh also that drug money is all walters hard work and he lost it when he understood what she had done with the money.
general 2023-05-15 02:22:59 Thats not resonable
general 2023-05-15 02:23:07 Thats messed up
general 2023-05-15 02:23:49 Hello
general 2023-05-15 02:24:35 Technically by the law this makes her on part with walter white
general 2023-05-15 02:24:42 So i mean
general 2023-05-15 02:25:49 Like she:
-fully knew it was drug money
-used drug money to pay soemone else debt
-fraud
-indirect involvment in murder
general 2023-05-15 02:26:02 The list probably goes on
general 2023-05-15 02:26:27 Indirect involvement because she knew about those murders
general 2023-05-15 02:26:31 And didnt say shit
general 2023-05-15 02:26:48 Ass
general 2023-05-15 02:33:01 Watt
general 2023-05-15 02:33:48 True

general 2023-05-15 03:01:21 How
general 2023-05-15 03:01:39 Ee is the best game out there for building on roblox
general 2023-05-15 03:01:51 Plane crazy is the most limited one in fact
general 2023-05-15 03:02:50 I mean ee is really hard to beat tbh, never seen that much freedom
general 2023-05-15 03:03:06 It aint realistic but theres evrrything including motor lock but 3d
general 2023-05-15 03:03:15 You can motor lock sideways
general 2023-05-15 03:03:36 No
general 2023-05-15 03:03:45 Dont think you get what i mean
general 2023-05-15 03:05:14 In ee you can copy and paste stuff and move different part of your build and stuff, because motors are considerated 2 parts, you can move one anywere you want, it will come back to the other part when you activate the build
general 2023-05-15 03:06:51 Tbh it is insane the degree of freedom ee gives, i dont feel bad saying it puts even besiege and stormwork to shame
general 2023-05-15 03:08:55 Me when i have 32 times 64m³ gold cubes in my pockets
general 2023-05-15 03:09:58 When you think about it, the least problematic thing about minecraft is the punching wood part
general 2023-05-15 03:10:08 Because the more you think about the rest
general 2023-05-15 03:10:26 The more you realise steve is actually god tier strenght

general 2023-05-15 03:18:32 Wait

general 2023-05-15 03:21:45 Yeah he had some t72
general 2023-05-15 03:21:56 But they got "liquidated"
general 2023-05-15 03:22:01 If you get what i mean
general 2023-05-15 03:23:37 They had 500 to 750 thats how shit the t72 is irl compared to abrams
general 2023-05-15 03:23:54 20 abrams vs iraqi 500 t72
general 2023-05-15 03:23:56 Loses

general 2023-05-15 03:25:41 War thunder giving t72 gen 3 thermals but gives abram gen 2
general 2023-05-15 03:26:02 Irl: 500 t72 obliterated for 0 abram lost
general 2023-05-15 03:26:09 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2023-05-15 03:26:18 Ok 1
general 2023-05-15 03:26:27 Fuck omg so unfair t72 too good
general 2023-05-15 03:27:59 They lost most of their older tanks and newer ones too
general 2023-05-15 03:28:10 America moment
general 2023-05-15 03:29:07 At the same time operation desert storm was litterally a modern blitkrieg and just like the germans, they got into situations friendly fire was almost impossible to avoid
general 2023-05-15 03:29:25 Like those guys were shooting tanks left and right
general 2023-05-15 03:29:31 THEN ABRAM IN FRONT
general 2023-05-15 03:31:09 India: i want aircraft carrier
Mother russia: no we have aircraft carrier at home

***incert image and explosive diarrhea sound here***
general 2023-05-15 03:32:22 It aint a carrier
general 2023-05-15 03:32:41 Even the aircraft carrier the russian had aint one
general 2023-05-15 03:32:58 Because of the treathy they signed with the turks
general 2023-05-15 03:33:16 Can pass the thingmabob with ships of x nature
general 2023-05-15 03:34:12 You dont know anything about naval history then, aircraft carrier were litterally at the start converted cargo ships
general 2023-05-15 03:34:16 To cary planes
general 2023-05-15 03:35:43 Aint us or me that did that terminology and following tradition i feel like newer class ships or different class of ship will just be again named differently
general 2023-05-15 03:35:47 Just to not
general 2023-05-15 03:35:55 Make some very complicated bs
general 2023-05-15 03:36:05 Like you are suggesting
general 2023-05-15 03:36:30 Heli carrier is a thing btw
general 2023-05-15 03:36:39 Just gonna point it out now
general 2023-05-15 03:37:17 Heli carriers
general 2023-05-15 03:39:39 To they even have a long enough aircraft carrier for normal jet take off and landing?
general 2023-05-15 03:39:50 Didnt japan only have heli carriers
general 2023-05-15 03:39:59 And.im not talking about VTOL JETS OKAY
general 2023-05-15 03:40:02 THHEY DONT COUNT
general 2023-05-15 03:40:07 they impractical
general 2023-05-15 03:40:13 Realistically
general 2023-05-15 03:41:10 Very limited amount of vtol planes can be placed in a heli carrier
general 2023-05-15 03:41:32 If that doesnt also point out that vtol jet are already limited by their nature
general 2023-05-15 03:42:24 You dont need full size aircraft carriers if you gonna protect your coasts indeed
general 2023-05-15 03:42:38 Even those heli carriers are a bit stretch
general 2023-05-15 03:43:26 Anything related to navy gonna rust at the dock for 30 years
general 2023-05-15 03:43:35 And they then scrap it or sell it
general 2023-05-15 03:43:40 Russian navy sumarized
general 2023-05-15 03:44:03 Russian navy never existed

general 2023-05-15 03:51:40 So much for nothing
general 2023-05-15 03:52:03 Made sense for around 5 years
general 2023-05-15 03:52:38 I mean russian didnt change their sub doctrine ever since so

general 2023-05-15 22:13:19 ANSWER MY QUESTION!1!!!1111
general 2023-05-15 22:13:36 Google
general 2023-05-15 22:16:17 30.48 to be exact
general 2023-05-15 22:16:32 Just calculated it
general 2023-05-15 22:22:32 I mean 40 mm and 0.8 one aint much
general 2023-05-15 22:22:46 In the grand scheme of things
general 2023-05-15 22:24:18 It all depends if you are engineer/architect or not
general 2023-05-15 22:24:30 For anything taller than a house that stacks up fast
general 2023-05-15 22:24:35 And can be deadly
general 2023-05-15 22:24:53 I bought your mom
general 2023-05-15 22:24:58 She was expired
general 2023-05-15 22:26:53 I mean you had to do like 8 calculation and you did them in 4 sec
general 2023-05-15 22:27:08 Even if you were the fastest man alive theres no way
general 2023-05-15 22:35:45 Another fancy way of saying you cheated instead of trying and then failed a question such as what is 0.875 in fraction
general 2023-05-15 22:36:17 Did you read what i said
general 2023-05-15 22:36:23 He didnt think smarter
general 2023-05-15 22:36:29 Makes him more stupid
general 2023-05-15 22:36:34 Cause he cant do it himself
general 2023-05-15 22:37:20 You are re
general 2023-05-15 22:37:45 If you cant do it by yourself and REQUIRE a calculator
general 2023-05-15 22:37:49 You are stupid
general 2023-05-15 22:37:52 Not smart
general 2023-05-15 22:37:58 You fit the definition of stupidity
general 2023-05-15 22:38:23 Regarded
general 2023-05-15 22:38:28 <a:mhm:1098120783882104843>
general 2023-05-15 22:38:51 Was that qhat i meant?
general 2023-05-15 22:38:57 Are u sure?
general 2023-05-15 22:39:01 You gonna cry now
general 2023-05-15 22:39:17 Because you need a calculator to do simple multiplications
general 2023-05-15 22:39:22 WHEN I DONT?
general 2023-05-15 22:39:49 My hero
general 2023-05-15 22:42:33 It has its limits, qorking smarter means you understand how to do something but you decide to make it easier, thus figuring a way to make it so by doing that thing called THINKING and thus saving energy not now but in the future, thats working smarter not harder, if you dont know how to do a math problem by yourself and require a software to solve it for you, that aint working smarter because you are only delaying the problem
general 2023-05-15 22:43:40 Average person who claims using a calculator = smarter
general 2023-05-15 22:43:51 Are you re
general 2023-05-15 22:44:03 <:manly_smile:788087969658961951>
general 2023-05-15 22:44:09 Thats the true question
general 2023-05-15 22:44:48 Using your brain is what makes you smart you idiot
general 2023-05-15 22:44:53 Jesus fuck this guy
general 2023-05-15 22:46:21 Clearly your point was that it is easier to just use a calculator which it is, why would you say that for any other reasons if your point didn't change and it is still that using calculator = smarter
general 2023-05-15 22:46:49 Ur FAT

general 2023-05-16 17:27:58 You can but technically you will always be more male than female
general 2023-05-16 17:28:05 Im not transphobic
general 2023-05-16 17:28:10 Im just saying
general 2023-05-16 17:28:19 You are fat

general 2023-05-16 17:30:17 Yeah and so i didnt chose to be born! But you cant just kill yourse, it is againt the law technically

general 2023-05-16 17:31:58 No matter thhe situation
general 2023-05-16 17:32:23 Most things in the universe will "live" for billion, trillions and eons before dying
general 2023-05-16 17:32:29 But they aint really alive
general 2023-05-16 17:32:32 Just objects
general 2023-05-16 17:32:42 So they wont apreciate anything in the universe
general 2023-05-16 17:32:46 You are tard
general 2023-05-16 17:33:36 Start by apreciating who you are before jumping to the conclusion you should change your entire gender
general 2023-05-16 17:33:43 Thats the point
general 2023-05-16 17:35:41 You know i had a deprecion that lasted 2-3 years of my life, dont tell me you are switching gender and you do it with consideration and you tried everything out before doing so at that "young" age
general 2023-05-16 17:35:52 You hate yourself
general 2023-05-16 17:35:58 And it is clear
general 2023-05-16 17:37:07 I have nothing against those operations, but normalizing it at a very young age is very wrong
general 2023-05-16 17:37:34 Like dude

general 2023-05-16 17:38:19 Imagine when you are 14 and decide to change gender, tf my guy
general 2023-05-16 17:38:39 You sure you explored all the pocibilities and stuff before taking that action?
general 2023-05-16 17:38:45 Truth is they didnt
general 2023-05-16 17:40:09 Even in thhe firery pit of hell, life
general 2023-05-16 17:40:14 Life would be a gift
general 2023-05-16 17:40:18 That you cannot refuse
general 2023-05-16 17:41:29 17 is still young tbh but thats my personal opinion it is a big dessision and cant really be undone
