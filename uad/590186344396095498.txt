creations-chat 2021-09-18 09:44:49 where did creations go? I was about to take a look at all the amazing things that people have built.
creations-chat 2021-09-25 01:09:50 <@!421068077556301844> the wings and all look great but the only problem is the front nose of the mig. It just isn’t very accurate and not curved. There are flat sides which don’t make it look great. 

Basically just fix up the front a bit
creations-chat 2021-09-25 22:26:41 No it looks rlly good like a Rocky hill  wouldn’t, stand out to me apart from the turret but it’s a tank so
creations-chat 2021-09-25 22:29:14 They are probably envious, so am I but I like it
