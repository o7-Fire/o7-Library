The Tale of iifatdoge (504118818583478273)
bug-reports 2020-06-07 02:52:14 Some of my creations are just randomly off balance. I have a rocket that's perfectly balanced, but still tips to the side after launch. I also created an aircraft, but it's off balance even though it's perfectly mirrored. When I deleted the blocks one by one to check, the yellow boi disappeared, so there were no invisible blocks. Saving and loading didn't fix it.
bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:45:09 Not sure if anyone else has said this, but ladders are unable to be selected sometimes
bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:46:04 Actually, not just ladders
bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:46:32 I can't select friction or ladders
bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:46:54 I could earlier in the same server tho
bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:47:02 Trail too

bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:47:18 Just random stuff

general 2020-06-07 22:23:10 There needs to be a camera setting to look through walls while building :I
general 2020-06-07 22:24:59 Building camera setting to see through walls when?
general 2020-06-07 22:25:12 !rank
general 2020-06-07 22:29:18 I have 2 quality of life suggestions. 1. Camera setting that lets you see through walls while building. 2. Build texture with outlines for clarification while building.
general 2020-06-07 22:29:56 Who lol
