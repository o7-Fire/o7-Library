bug-reports 2019-10-16 19:02:18 Im having problems with control panels on my new planes (old ones work fine but new planes I make have the same problem) https://gyazo.com/20a5bb73fa41ca3342c68072aeca85a4

found out the problem it was me trying to make plane smaller so placing main pilot seat looking upward*** but I still do not have a clue about 2nd problem
bug-reports 2019-10-16 19:04:09 also center of mass and lift have some sort of problems too as sometimes in a perfectly symmetrical build center of mass can be closer to one side and when you reload the creation from saves the location of center of mass can change a lot

bug-reports 2020-09-16 16:54:19 1) I try to fold my creation but once its folded it gets a bit glitchy jumping around and then launches itself back to its original location and looping until I stop the folding process
2) motor 2 with 180 degree movement both buttons I assign (forward - backward) do both actions (like forw = T and back = B but B moves it forw as well as T but sometimes it suddenly reverses without despawning)

both of these issues happen on both of my creations that have 180 fold

also my friend does not have any of these issues

anyone can help me with this ? because of this I cant build some of my ideas.
bug-reports 2020-09-16 19:20:04 well they do work as well but they can pretty much move around instead of staying in place like motor 2 does when it doesnt glitch
bug-reports 2020-09-16 19:23:45 yep both on
bug-reports 2020-09-16 19:24:14 for some reason it glitches around not only that but both forward and backward buttons do same movements on 180 degree like they dont know which direction is which

I also use an anchor maybe that has something to do with it? I cant test without anchor cuz Im surrounded with other's creations its hard to fold it

and also sure Im not doing anything wrong with folding
help 2020-09-17 20:52:21 can I get some help with my helicopter ?? its the 2nd ever heli I made  (1st one was basically a platform with a seat testing out how to make a heli) it never stays stable even height I spawn causes it's behaviour to change
help 2020-09-17 21:00:24 well I gave it a shape put controlling thrusters etc but the problem is that I cannot even test if the controls work because it sways forward and backward and rotates one direction
help 2020-09-17 21:02:46 yep
help 2020-09-17 21:02:57 using motors to turn them instead of rockets as well
