also  i bet those rockets dont even fucking work
(also as as side note the canopies on the a3 and eurofighter both look like literal shit)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:28:36 i was expecting 'pvp plane' from a mile away. welcome to pcc, nobody  gives a fuck, your build is shit, and i forgot to mention the shitty colours

 to go into more detail let me give a singular fucking example  (how it goes from block to half cylinder)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:33:19 people will be rude. do not post until your builds actually fucking look good 🗿

(consequence of being made fun of by anyone with common sense)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:35:55 motorlock it until you either cant or  its 2000 blocks. proceed to hide the motorlock (try to use motorlock to actually make it look good)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 18:38:21 ive seen it in both speechbubbles and from you in <#384021699466756107> . its shit 
fix canopy and colours by making the canopy more realistic with detail like  trails or something im NOT the person to consult on making stuff look good
