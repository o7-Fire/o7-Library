The Tale of _d4mn_ (303966532134895618)
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 13:29:26 Hi Friends!
I am a father of a 5 years old who loves planes and loves to play Plane Crazy. He can't read yet, so what this means that I need to build stuff for him and he plays with them.
The problem is, I don't have the time nor the talent to build planes that looks real. Mines are doggy and cant even fly properly.

If there is anybody who would be willing to create a few planes for my son then I can offer you some payment in exchange. (PayPal / Robux)

DM me if you are interested.
