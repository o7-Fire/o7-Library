general 2022-04-25 12:00:36 Hey guys so I was just watching something on the A-10 Warthog and apparently it can fly with half a wing missing, this is interesting because TheMadVulpens A-10 can actually fly with half a wing missing, I tested this when I was building it and got bored when I had only completed 1 and a half of its wings
general 2022-04-25 12:03:24 It um.... Cannot fly if in the process of getting half the wing shot off some of the bullets goes into the body of the plane and destroys one or more of the super rocket engines that power it
