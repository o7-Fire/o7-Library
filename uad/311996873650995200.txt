plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:50:29 How do I put in a suggestion, creation, or anything that a bot posts?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:54:42 I have made the ultimate ship destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:54:57 100% of the time it sinks any ship without fail
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:55:47 Capable of destroying Savoics ship in a few seconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:56:25 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:56:33 I call it, the ultimate ship killer
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:26 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:32 The ship itself is not suicide
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:41 Thats for a coolness factor
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:58:43 In fact the ship dosent do anything

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:59:09 People think they are shooting at a ship
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:59:33 In reality I sneak below them and shred them
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:00:17 It is
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:00:42 But Im horrible at making decent ships so I use this strat
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:01:13 My planes on the other hand work very well
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 06:01:25 But its more satisfying to shred a ship
help 2019-05-18 13:58:18 How does one submit a creation?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 13:59:22 Thats cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 14:07:05 You can also kill the engines to make it basically hover
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 14:09:16 Then where would I post it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 14:09:31 Oh, Thanks

creations-chat 2019-05-18 14:12:42 My Delta Fighter, 567 going flat 553 going straight up, can do a complete u turn in 2 seconds and turn around in a complete circle in 5 seconds. You can also kill the engines to have it glide while retaining most of its altitude at a speed of 10.

general 2019-05-19 22:49:41 <@260534086400081920> Think of space flight simulator as a mobile version of ksp, also for the full experience you need to pay 5$

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:39:49 I thought it was some scifi ship
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:40:02 I will now make a plane without wings I will be back later
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:40:23 Good contrast to my 99% wings plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:40:29 Needed to have a seat and engines
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:40:41 I say 7-8

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:46:55 Funnily enough I never have been hit with a shot
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:51:20 reeeeeeee
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:51:30 a update glitched the surfaces now I need to redo them
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:58:02 oof
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:58:11 A update messed up the auto control surfaces
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:03:27 https://gyazo.com/23ff2d7874ba3d90bff2be2d29c14b6b The control surfaces nearest the camera are manually controlled, the ones further from the camera are auto. The front ones are inverted and make the plane impossible to fly. It worked previously.
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:04:09 And by worked previously I mean that the further ones acted as a elevator and rotated it, now they act as a elevator.
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:04:20 Back ones when set to auto also behave like a elevator
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:07:09 Please clarify.

bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:17:55 Ok, I built a perfect replica and it works
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:18:17 The old config was messed up after the update I assume
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:40:21 And I doubt that anyone has something this long
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:40:47 It works better when you say its NSFW but I dont want to risk a ban

creations-chat 2019-06-09 19:56:33 Submission for novice

My version of the F-86 F2 Sabre, I used the real life sabre and made it into a vehicle for plane crazy, it could be better looking however as I mainly play PVP it has more emphasis on performance rather than looks. Top speed 557 in level flight and made of 160 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:57:38 How does one get a rank, do I just post it in <#384025409945337856> with a rank request?

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 16:50:52 Like you can shoot the person and the whole plane stays still, but a seat keeps moving and the seat still has the plane intact

bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:05:14 There is currently a game breaking bug
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:05:31 Near impossible to film so I will try describing it
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:07:18 If you shoot off part of a players vehicle it will remain still in the air and floating, you can interact with it and visually destroy parts but it is all client sided. Sometimes the entire vehicle will have this. On the server the actual vehicle keeps flying and you can shoot and damage it, but its all inviable to you. The vehicle while invisible can still damage you and its like bullets and rockets appearing out of nowhere
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:07:58 A seat without a player is all that remains that visually moves sometimes
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:18:58 Got a video of it
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:22:19 To recreate it just shoot at something and it will happen sometimes
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:22:46 I will screenshot debug menu next time it happens
bug-reports 2019-08-02 17:27:44 Rejoining seemed to help as I was able to complete a fight without it happening
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 17:28:24 Are there pvp tournaments?
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 17:29:36 weeb

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:57:22 Im trying to make a ship based off the skjold class corvette and cant figure out how to get 2000+ blocks into it for Shipwright [IV] without  'cheating' to get more blocks into it.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:57:52 What?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:58:10 That would require rebuilding the whole ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:58:45 I wasn't planning on fitting 2000+ blocks into a corvette
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:59:21 No, im putting 2000+ blocks into it

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 22:59:48 Not originally
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:00:14 Im going to cover it in small details and place more fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:00:16 That will work
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:00:57 Because I need to place more blocks down
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:01:20 Its not like any amount of fuel I can fit into it can power >20 Super rocket engines used for propulsion anyways.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:02:15 The hull of my ship is a big empty space
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:02:30 I will make furniture, that will work.
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:02:46 Im making a smaller more detailed build
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:03:15 For PVP
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:03:34 1x1 hulls are harder to destroy than beam hulls from experience
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:04:03 Thats a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:04:06 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 23:04:31 I always build combat vehicles, than make them look nice.

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 22:08:43 I like the update thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 22:08:44 Its cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 22:08:55 The game is updating
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 22:09:00 All servers are closing ofr it
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 23:55:37 The lava spitters need a buff
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 23:55:47 I straight up dumped lava on a plane and nothing happened
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 23:56:13 Directly hitting it for 7 seconds straight before someone shot off his left wing
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 23:56:50 No wait, I knocked off one of his delta wing 1x1s
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 23:56:55 On a 747

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:31:40 This guy is threatening to report anyone who kills him in a PVP server
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:31:53 I already did
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:32:05 He also 'reported' someone who he never even saw
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:32:13 He is on a normal server
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:32:16 Normal pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:44:21 *is incredibly toxic* I *gets killed as soon as they spawn* I *surprised pikachu face*
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:45:47 The best part is that they are in very poorly made mechs
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:46:01 They can be killed in 2 seconds by one gun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:47:42 Its not that it pens multiple layers
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 02:47:51 They only have 1 block thick legs

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:33:30 Connector blocks with the option to connect to others builds
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:33:58 Im not going to suggest something for awhile
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:34:25 2nd suggestion up is still mine with 23 downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:34:55 I cant tell if I phrased it wrong or something, but a lot of people seem to hate a reasonable suggestion.
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:36:12 To keep people from camping in their spawn and making themselves invulnerable to bombs
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:36:20 And possible rockets, but I haven't tested that yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:37:52 Everyone thinks that
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:37:57 A lot of people are wrong
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:37:59 now including me
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:40:38 This is getting annoying
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:40:47 When my bomber spawns in the bombs spawn before the bay
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:40:52 Oh, hi
plane-crazy 2019-08-23 05:41:11 I made a montage of a ton of great builds, if anyone could check it out that would be great.

plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:50:07 oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:50:28 Yes I did
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:50:32 It makes it turn better

plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:01:28 I went from listening to rasputin nightcore remixes to painting all my ships like the kirov class battlecruiser
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:01:49 Well, based off it. I dont like how light the side is
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:16:30 Is a 1x7 harder to destroy than a 1x1?
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:17:01 oofer
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:17:47 Are 1x7s immune to rockets?
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:18:25 "So that was a fucking lie"
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:18:36 Time to think of new armour methods
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:19:54 I try doing that, but the sides of my ship are so short I cant to that properly without looking ugly
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:20:45 This is my one good looking vehicle though
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:20:47 oofer time
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:20:53 I have a idea

plane-crazy 2019-08-28 04:25:44 Thats a thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:05:22 Yes, my suggestion of delta control surfaces was added
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:05:39 I need to make a spitfire when I can get back on
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 22:08:05 I am incapable of telling sarcasm from lack of knowledge so I'm putting this here just to be safe. A spitfire.
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:34:22 I am hopeless when it comes to trying to design a good looking tail
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:48:49 I hate painting RAF camo
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:49:45 The USAF lacks spitfires

plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:55:57 No
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:56:06 I want to build historical planes
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 15:57:48 What is a parachute wing?

plane-crazy 2019-09-08 23:17:44 Huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-08 23:18:19 500 speed in any of my other planes seems to be 5x as fast
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 01:31:56 Why dont we have friction cylinders?
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 01:33:12 Yes and no at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 01:33:53 I see  a lot of uses for it on my bomber
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 01:34:03 And see toxic turret players abusing it
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 01:34:57 I can now put proper turrets on my bomber

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:27:42 That has invisible guns and rockets
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:31:21 
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:35:31 Trim

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:37:14 Open the video
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:37:24 Click the crayon pencil thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:37:34 And trim it down
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:37:38 I can still do it <@!429826358827417601>
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:38:05 By pressing
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:38:12 /
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 16:41:45 Looks like youre on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:13:52 Amazing things can happen
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:14:44 If you have a perfect 1:1 TWR and your wings, verticle stabilizer, and entire horizontal stabiliser are on a motor
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:15:06 Sucks to be him
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:17:35 All my aircraft will become super-maneuverable
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:17:48 Im this bored
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:18:30 Ever seen a B-29 pull a cobra
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:18:59 Well its going to happen
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:19:14 While not making the plane look horrendus
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:20:21 Its at a point I cant use any of my planes for dogfighting
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:25:38 My tail is acting like a airbrake its so effective
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:25:57 Its left the realm of effective
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:28:50 If this game had a mouse control system like war thunder it would literally be point and click
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:29:07 Dosent bleed speed in a turn thanks to its TWR
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:29:15 Turns faster than most helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:29:38 Its only limit is roll rate because I dont have enough space left to make it roll like a god
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:30:14 Unless
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:36:25 Nope it cant auto roll
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:41:59 Best thing is it accidentally came out as 69 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 19:27:25 I did some work to its turn rate
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 19:27:28 
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 19:27:51 Issue is I cant control it enough to aim at anything other than a blimp
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 03:50:45 We need cannons
bot-central 2020-05-19 03:50:55 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 03:51:30 Looking at all the tanks and battleships having to use rockets and machine guns it just
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:02:25 I broke the game with my bomber
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:02:37 My engineering skills knows no bounds
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 05:02:38 https://gyazo.com/2b7918339edf8626f50792571d3a04f8
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:42:19 I like how the thumbnail celebrates 1m visits when the game almost has 40m
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:48:11 Now, I have a question
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:48:25 Does the speaker have a setting to only play when a button is held down for it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:49:08 Me means the rockets from the turrets
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 04:49:14 Because we dont have cannons yet
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 22:51:44 How do I make a okay looking computer
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 22:51:50 For interior design
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 22:53:01 nvm I found a way
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:13:02 We need bigger cylinder blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:13:16 Circular
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:13:21 I want to make a phlanax
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:13:27 10/10 spelling
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:29:02 What do you think of my turret so far?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 23:29:07 
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 00:28:13 <@!702068186119405578> Where did you get the outline
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 00:28:25 Tell  me
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 00:31:32 :(
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 00:32:42 Building in small spaces just got a lot more hellish
general 2020-05-21 01:36:55 What is improved color?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:37:43 In stormworks you can toggle outlines
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:37:57 It would be nice if we had that option ingame
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:38:09 rick did say he was working on a custom outline
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:38:11 I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:13:06 So I have a question about motors as control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:13:20 Is there a way to make ailerons using motors attached to wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:19:58 How do you do it?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:20:32 So far I have only succeded in making a bad elevator, and some mess that made me do loop de loopes
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:21:23 o
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 19:22:14 Thanks

general 2020-05-28 22:41:53 There is
general 2020-05-28 22:41:57 This is my third remodel
general 2020-05-28 22:42:23 Every time there is a improvement of some sort
general 2020-05-28 22:42:52 It started even worse
general 2020-05-28 22:42:55 
general 2020-05-28 22:43:11 Then I made this
general 2020-05-28 22:43:16 
general 2020-05-28 22:43:30 Now I need the front to look half decent
general 2020-05-28 22:44:01 oof
general 2020-05-28 22:44:20 Now I need to lob off the front of it again
general 2020-05-28 22:45:02 Okay
general 2020-05-28 22:45:14 Next one is based off the Ju 288 or Tu 95
general 2020-05-28 22:46:41 What?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:38:37 Made my bomber have a near perfect 1:1 TWR
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:39:34 Who needs pughachevs cobra to make people overshoot
general 2020-06-18 00:05:41 Decal blocks that are sizeable
general 2020-06-18 00:05:46 I need a flying waifu
general 2020-06-18 00:05:53 To hide how ugly my plane actually is
general 2020-06-18 00:07:43 Blocks that are 9. on all sides but one
general 2020-06-18 00:07:49 And blocks that are .9 on two sides
general 2020-06-18 00:08:00 And blocks that are .9 on 4 sides
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 00:13:58 You can what?
general 2020-06-18 00:34:30 Hull destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 00:40:05 All my keybinds broke for explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 00:41:11 vnm im dum dum
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 00:41:13 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 00:41:16 I was in a non pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 01:00:35 The hell is it with people and box cars with guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 01:03:06 They serve as nothing but target practice
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 01:03:18 Seeing as they literally cant aim their guns up
bot-central 2020-06-18 01:10:37 =p fortunate sun

plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:37:14 I *really* hate the people who make those damn squid things
general 2020-06-21 21:46:17 So uh
general 2020-06-21 21:46:20 What does the update add
general 2020-06-21 21:46:24 And what does the water jet do?
general 2020-06-21 21:46:37 PVP weapons
general 2020-06-21 21:47:12 What does water jet do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:19:44 ~~so its useless~~
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:20:11 So
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:20:17 Is there a way to make your plane roll better
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:20:37 I know that, but I cant make it roll
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:20:46 It just makes my alierons act like my tail
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:20:57 Well, elevator
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:29:33 Okay so my issue is I just cant build a proper aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:29:54 Also do ballast blocks visually change the center of gravity?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:33:54 hm
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:34:36 so
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:34:44 I just cant build medium aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:34:59 It wont fly straight
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:35:32 Oh well
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:35:42 Back to building super ugly 50 block large fighters
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:35:50 Seeing as thats the only thing I am capable of doing
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:36:22 And even that comes out bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:38:00 Because you cant make mouse guided ailerons
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:38:04 you cant aim the guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:55:45 I wish we had light cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:02 Acted like normal guns, but were slightly explosive and slower with a slower firerate
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:03 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:10 And are two blocks long
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:27 That way we can use something other than tiny pea shooters
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:34 Or slow rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:56:38 Or useless fireworks
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:57:20 But even more than that we need normal cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:57:34 Its sad looking at battleships with machine guns as a main armament
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 23:00:22 I have a corvette
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 05:55:23 pvp meta is dull and boring
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 05:56:33 Its either super fast, small, super maneuverable planes you cant hit. Cars that are just wheels and guns. and squid things
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 21:31:03 So I have a motor system to make my tail and rudder automatically pitch after my mouse
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 21:31:20 Is there a way to make a motor cause my wings to roll when I move my mouse side to side?
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:56:01 How can I detail a small interior
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 22:57:43 Good idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 00:46:17 Actual air to air missiles should be a thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 00:46:42 As a counter to the squid things
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 00:47:12 And air to air combat has become impossible anymore
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 00:47:49 Tiny, fast, very nimble aircraft that are impossible to hit
creations-chat 2021-02-10 23:54:36 <@!430739561690431489> How do you get shaders?
