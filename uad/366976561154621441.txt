help 2020-04-14 21:07:18 you mean a torpedo?
help 2020-04-14 21:07:24 cuz i can't reload them
help 2020-04-14 21:08:09 but that makes pvp boring
help 2020-04-14 21:09:03 that is true
help 2020-04-14 21:09:17 but i wanted to make something that fires atleast 5 torpedos
help 2020-04-14 21:09:21 and that won't fit
help 2020-04-14 21:11:07 they already spam fireworks and rockets
help 2020-04-14 21:11:14 why not make an explosive that works underwater
help 2020-04-14 21:11:25 guns work underwater too
help 2020-04-14 21:12:18 guns work underwater!
help 2020-04-14 21:12:38 wdym
help 2020-04-14 21:13:12 that's what i want to add
help 2020-04-14 21:13:54 yeah but im telling you, i need a torpedo that reloads constantly in the same go
help 2020-04-14 21:14:12 of course i can make a torpedo out of tnts and propellers
help 2020-04-14 21:14:21 but its just 1
help 2020-04-14 21:16:15 and they should add just 1 or 2
help 2020-04-14 21:16:21 and reduce the rockets
help 2020-04-14 21:16:29 bc 12 are too much
help 2020-04-14 21:17:18 so your point is that pre made explosive weapons are getting spammed by noobs
help 2020-04-14 21:17:29 cause they don't have creativity?
help 2020-04-14 21:18:30 yes i know
help 2020-04-14 21:18:46 but user made weapons just use so much space
help 2020-04-14 21:19:01 rockets are awesome because they are 2 blocks in size
help 2020-04-14 21:19:04 and they reload
help 2020-04-14 21:19:22 the problem is the quantity
help 2020-04-14 21:19:37 it could perfectly split into 6 rockets and 6 torpedos
help 2020-04-14 21:20:16 i built the robot that's on my pfp and in pvp its useless because 12 rockets are homing at me and they wreck the thing instantly
help 2020-04-14 21:21:12 that would be cool
help 2020-04-14 21:21:19 blocks that reappear
help 2020-04-14 21:21:23 EXCELLENT
help 2020-04-14 21:21:33 but it would be op tho
help 2020-04-14 21:21:41 yes
help 2020-04-14 21:54:23 that would be nice
