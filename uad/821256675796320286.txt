plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:08:36 what?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:09:04 i dont watch plane crazy videos and my friend said plane crazy 2 was coming, thats how i dont know that
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:09:21 i dont believe that
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:10:06 bro go in development, he said gliding could be possible in pc2, and the release date could be in summer
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:10:21 sure

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:10:34 how then buddy
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:10:39 nah not everyone
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:11:12 probably because they have to still work on pc1, and he just wants breaks or something
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:11:33 oh, cool
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:11:50 bruh i literally need to go to school with motor lock

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:16:45 *motor lock is key to success and will solve every solution*
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:16:59 lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:21:08 yeah but it just would make life easier not having to make 3 motor lock towers and filling up all ur keyboard keys binding them for angle locks and shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:21:47 it would just make life easier if it was easier though
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:21:50 thats what im trying to say
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:22:42 it may already be easy but it would just make life easier, besides having realistic and cool looking planes are hard as in pc1 and it should be easier in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 01:24:03 well ima continue working on my f16
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:20:22 bro hover drive is op asf

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:20:13 how the hell do pro builders make their control panels un noticable
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:20:22 and it turns so well
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:20:29 ik they use motor lock but im still fkn confused
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:26:35 u see i want to make a su 33 but im not ready/skilled enoguh for a su 33
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:27:17 it happened with my mig 29 i was trying to make one and i just thought nah f16 would be easier ima just do that

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:29:51 back gear is easy yeah i can do that
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:29:58 but nose gear is a whole near level
