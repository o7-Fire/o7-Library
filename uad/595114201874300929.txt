general 2020-09-02 17:38:07 No new map, bigger map
general 2020-09-02 17:38:08 DUh
general 2020-09-02 17:38:30 Bigger map
general 2020-09-02 17:38:31 Moment
general 2020-09-02 17:39:39 Commit Fortnite and erase the map with a black hole
the-dump 2020-09-13 20:24:29 There might be a slight problem here
the-dump 2020-09-13 20:27:22 Ah ok
the-dump 2020-09-13 20:27:35 Issue resolved
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:20:17 I got a problem... I made a Boeing-777 with fold wings. The thing is, every time I fly, the wings like to unfold and go everywhere. Of course, they're on toggle and are at max speed and torque. Any way I can lock the wings midair?
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:21:23 But that would pause them in their unfolded phase, wouldn't it?

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:23:07 That was obviously sarcasm
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:23:25 Oh, good.
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:26:59 <@!251880826386513924> Thank, mate
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:27:36 I had no clue lock was an on and off function
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:28:32 Amazing

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:31:46 Cool
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:55:36 My first passenger plane (I made myself that works). Can't believe I finished it
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:55:44 Sorry, that was off topic

general 2020-10-07 22:18:22 Did they debuff flying? My plane is slow all of the suddent
general 2020-10-07 22:19:41 > <@!595114201874300929> it's because you died
<@456226577798135808>  I wasn't in pvp
general 2020-10-07 22:20:32 I wish
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 22:42:50 So, I made a self controllable missile that I connected with some disconnectors. For some reason, the missile pauses when it gets detached and the super rocket turns on
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 22:43:16 Anyone know why, or the solution?

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:42:26 My controls surfaces don't work at all, poggers
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:43:17 I don't spawn there
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:44:56 Whenever I exit my main seat (To switch to a pilot seat because of the amazing glitch that fixes aerodynamics) the control surfaces just absolutely fail
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:46:32 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:46:35 It does that
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:46:41 Really cool, I'll link a vid
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:48:01 Uhhhh, wdym. I don't see any errors in that sentence. The grammar was a bit off but I see no errors
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:50:34 I'm still absolutely confused but whatever. I'll figure it out myself

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:57:36 ...
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:57:54 That's also incorrect
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 13:57:56 But whatever
