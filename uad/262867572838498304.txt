plane-crazy 2019-10-29 15:53:26 Yes
bug-reports 2020-06-14 12:21:07 is it just me or is control surfaceses broken
bug-reports 2020-06-14 12:21:31 i have like 1000 of them on my plane and got alot of speed but it does not want to go up
bug-reports 2020-06-14 12:29:47 fix them
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:08:49 Does anyone else have a problem with control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:09:31 what i mean is that you will need a million of them to get your small plane in the air
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:10:10 i had a plane and it worked really good but after a update it just could not takeoff
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:11:25 my aircraft is small and light soo it can't be weight
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:12:04 <@456226577798135808> what do you mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:12:52 thats my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:13:22 i just wished that the  devs would buff it
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 15:17:36 bruh
general 2020-10-24 17:27:59 Do anyone agree that the devs should fix control surfaces
general 2020-10-24 17:32:38 what i mean is that you need 10000 control surfaces to able to lift up a small plane
bug-reports 2020-10-24 17:35:00 **Fix control surfaces**
