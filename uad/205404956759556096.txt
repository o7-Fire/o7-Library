plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:31:12 <@456226577798135808> I made the T95 Super Heavy Tank

plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:43:30 shaking my smh my head
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:44:46 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:49:20 exactly
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 20:49:21 i'm in
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:06:53 Uh guys, the new corner wedges are quite one-side at the moment.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:05:06 Hey Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:05:08 Sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:05:18 I'm currently playing Gmod but I'll multitask
help 2018-11-11 23:31:08 Could anyone be of assistance? I just built a jet (Eurofighter Typhoon), and it flies fast and fine, but somehow it always goes to the right, no matter what I do. It's frustrating, and I took it apart piece by piece to check for errors, block placement, etc. and found nothing wrong, even with the thrust. Incase it's asked, yes it is balanced.
help 2018-11-11 23:32:32 
help 2018-11-11 23:39:20 I'll try replacing the thrust with that, then.
help 2018-11-11 23:39:26 What is the problem then?
help 2018-11-11 23:39:31 Huh
help 2018-11-11 23:40:00 If I had a picture I'd show you, I took down all the blocks in my jet for testing, and yet nothing worked.
help 2018-11-11 23:40:11 I'll try replacing the wing panels
help 2018-11-11 23:40:18 If I get results from both tests, I'll return.
help 2018-11-11 23:44:50 Did both tests, to no avail. Guess I'll have to scrap this plane.
help 2018-11-11 23:45:41 Is this a bug that is being looked into atm? Because it's quite game breaking
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:49:34 I have just experienced a bug while building and testing my jet, and I'm sure other players have experienced it too. Seems to be happening with a lot of people. The bug makes whatever aircraft you built turn/tilt too much to one side, and regardless of how you modify it or balance it, it still persists. Hopefully this has already been considered and is being looked into.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:50:30 Yes, that is true. I have a 1k+ block plane and it works fine.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:50:46 However, it doesn't seem to be messing with all planes, it just has a random chance of happening.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:51:59 Yes, like James said.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:52:08 It doesn't affect the ailerons, it has more to do with a rudder turn.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:52:18 And no, it isn't balancing mistakes at all.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:52:27 Check <#478584971670454284>, I posted my plane there.
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:53:48 My cargo door pistons disappear after a few seconds of flying.
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:44:15 Does a phallos count as a worthy creation?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:46:41 That ship is ages 3+
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:48:28 Paul can we get a bird's eye view of that craft?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:49:08 I like the shape of the wings, closest to reality
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:49:32 Jack, what is your pfp
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:49:40 Is it a f u r r y
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:49:59 I see part of a thigh high
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:50:26 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:50:35 Just noticing, not criticizing btw
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:51:35 rip
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:52:17 Some guy pinged everyone earlier
help 2018-11-16 01:04:00 Guys, I need help with a guy straight up ripping off my F-14 design. He's been in my server for a couple minutes now copying my plane block by block, and when I approached him he immediately began deleting some pieces to cover it up.
help 2018-11-16 01:04:03 I took some pics for proof.
help 2018-11-16 01:04:16 
help 2018-11-16 01:04:23 
help 2018-11-16 01:04:56 His name is xDiegovalx
help 2018-11-16 01:17:22 Seriously? Plagiarism is a very big offense to the original creator, and it ruins creativity, don't you agree?
help 2018-11-16 01:17:48 I understand now, but it would be good to have in-game admins for things like this
help 2018-11-16 01:18:10 Huh.
help 2018-11-16 01:22:15 Yeah like I said, it was looking exactly like mine, even with the indents for the sweepable wings, but he changed it
help 2018-11-16 01:22:18 I switched saves, yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 01:25:00 That is messing with my eyes, I thought it was a legit futuristic rocket at first and it was just your giant head popping out the front
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 01:56:26 Is it possible to put a chair on a player and fly him?
help 2018-11-16 06:03:50 Question, is it natural to get absurd wobble in very fast creations when rolling and yawing?
help 2018-11-16 06:04:08 Ok then, phew, thought it was my balancing problems
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:43:40 Can we just have the 1x1 delta wings bug fixed
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:44:23 
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:44:29 'not a bug' yeah okay mhmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:45:50 Nice.
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:46:08 My only question is how things like these can be broken so easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:46:25 The delta wings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:46:36 Yeah, they are
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:47:37 But that still doesn't answer how by being new they are subject to breaking so easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:48:15 Ahh, I'll keep it quiet. I know you can't help it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:48:45 Congratulations.

plane-crazy 2018-11-16 23:43:23 Looks like the Turismo from GTA
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:27:14 Is warmongering allowed in this server? Because I have a fleet of very capable intergalatic travel combat VTOL ships ready for shipping.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:02 <@!295568493166985218> Sorry for late response, playing something else. I think it's very possible, and would be cool to have a very big crew of intergalatic ships, possibly themed too.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:31 Responding to James...
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:45 Ehh, we could have various classes of ships if that's not your thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:53 Frigates, fighters and battle stations
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:33:25 We'll organize something big later if we must, as I'm currently busy grinding in another game
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:49:43 Does putting a pilot seat on a player and piloting him count as an unique invention?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:04:24 I would think of making something inventor worthy right now but I'm busy ***grinding*** as I have stated nefore
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:04:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:05:00 You can actually see how busy I am by my rushed grmmar
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:05:06 mwsno exmcue me
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:13:51 Good idea, so you can pepper planes in the sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:19:22 Races at the airport
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:19:42 You mean drag racing, right? Because it's too small for either circuit or point to point races
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:19:47 Yeah, and drift
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:30:53 Turn it off for 10 seconds and then turn it on again
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:34:42 Sorry we couldn't help you, please contact your provider's call center for more information.

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 03:23:25 can it fit the ships inside
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 03:23:37 the ships themselves are actually pretty big, imagine this
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 03:24:31 No problem

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 04:22:11 I have a suggestion: Best Looking Original Plane Design
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:53:32 Has anyone ever made a closed magnet drive engine system?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:54:08 A fully encased magnet drive you can't notice at first from the outside
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:54:30 
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:54:32 This is only powered by a magnet
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:55:28 
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:02:32 A magnet drive, on a plane, with a cockpit and a closed fuselage
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:02:47 Other player can't guess right away that it is powered by magnets inside
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:03:14 It can fly and do barrel rolls pretty well, too
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:03:23 I have the video, I'll post it here
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:03:31 I actually did an aileron roll but it doesn't matter rn

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:08:13 Magnet drive powered plane I mentioned earlier
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:21:22 Maybe when you fly, the stress placed on the motors make it glitch out? I've had this happen with my foldable wing F4U Corsair
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:21:38 The foundation for the tilting was pretty stable, mind you
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:21:42 And robust
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:21:54 I've perfected it now lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:22:01 It was when I was still a noob

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:22:32 can you show us a closer pic?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:30:32 Make the Antonov AN-225
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:31:06 I'll make it, in a week's time
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:31:13 He made a pumpjack
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:35:44 What do you guys think of the paintjob? Can fit two passengers hugging eachother uncomfortably, and can get up to 800+ speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:35:49 
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:38:39 I paint the fuselage silver, the flaps white and the borders black
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:38:47 It is a paintjob
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:39:02 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:43:34 How do you guys keep the interlocking plane pieces, y'know, locked securely?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:43:45 Do any of you use **m a g n e t s**?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:44:05 That's true
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:44:28 I'm only using 2 magnets for my new test plane and it's stuttering me to shit
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:44:35 ROBLOX is so unoptimized
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:45:09 They do make your plane faster than anything else by any means
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:45:27 What, why

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:48:11 Make it actually type words on scre- No that would be beyond this game
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:48:36 Light blocks are a must
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:48:54 That's reminding me of Minecraft's redstone system
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:48:59 I don't play Minecraft, by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:49:50 Keep logic gates out
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:50:07 I want it more akin to SimplePlanes rather than other stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:50:47 VIP server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:51:04 Racing with cars, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:51:25 Any engines automatically make the cars you are driving batmobiles ;(
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:51:46 Noice
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:51:56 Are you the owner of the red sports car?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:53:54 This is why Macs are the kind of OS you use to test virus potency
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:54:13 Don't shame Imperial for having a Mac tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 06:54:28 I never said you are
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:05:15 You shouldn't disregard other people's inputs just because they mention that, though. Some of them may be correct, and that can be considered rude.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:05:56 Don't attack me for this, It's just what I believe in.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:07:25 I didn't ever mention jackasses like that deserve your attention, I said *some*.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:08:11 oh my
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:08:24 Why does that look like an old brick phone?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:08:54 No shit.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:09:19 No need to call me an idiot if you clearly stated it's a calculator, I know it is one.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:09:25 Your aggression is misplaced here, buddy.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:10:20 Computers are complex calculators though.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:10:40 **calculus**
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:10:45 I'm not continuing any argument
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:10:52 K
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:10:56 potassium
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:12:42 All of those look like they would lose all of their wheels in the first 100 or so sps
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:12:44 Except yours
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:13:06 Can I join you guy's server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:13:37 Now do the same race, but without any engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:13:54 >all players accelerate at the same pace and arrive together
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:15:02 Imperial do you purposefully get all of these ranks so no one can take a closer look at your pfp when they click your image?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:15:24 ???
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:15:30 2 + ???
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:16:25 Oh yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:17:01 Play minesweeper on that thing, paint the pistons and place disconnectors over them to act as the field
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:17:45 lmao goteem
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:17:59 A calculator
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:20 A display on a calculator
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:29 uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:30 UHHH
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:33 paint it red and yellow?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:46 I can faintly make out a 24 on the display screen
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:18:51 you gotta really think about it though
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:20:02 Damn lmao, that looks like one of the creations new players make in BYM
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:21:12 Just make it mention everyone
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:21:57 Do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:22:00 And record it
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:22:20 YES
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:22:24 Add king kong on top
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:24:18 We're not discussing anything openly, though.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:24:23 How does it apply to rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:24:39 Don't planes technically drift when they yaw?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:24:47 Alright.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:26:48 Make it retractable.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:26:55 It would look extra beefy though
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:27:34 Wait, why? How does it have so many keybinds?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:28:15 18 keybinds, since you need both forward and backwards for yours, Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:28:32 Huh
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:28:45 You should do it like vip
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:30:12 I could do it in an afternoon If I'm really into it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:31:01 Add a bodykit, cannards and rear diffuser <@427466925275217931>
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:32:22 Don't you think you guys are over estimating, though?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:32:31 He could do it in one sitting if he's really into the build
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:32:49 Do you sit down for one entire day?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:33:16 This guy is a legend

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 07:44:35 Bruh I lost it before even realizing what November's month was

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:58:57 British people say 'boog'
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:59:25 Which to them might seem to be the correct form to spell it as seen how Americans pronounce things differently within the same language
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:59:39 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 13:59:54 I did do the 10 second full vertical climb on my magnet drive plane demonstration
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:00:00 Doesn't mean I'm worthy though ;(
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:00:41 Magnets connected to a suspension block, separated by a beam and another magnet in the back
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:01:12 I actually made my magnet engine be pretty concealed within my plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:01:30 I might make a 500+ part creation later and publish that engine in hopes of getting Inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:03:48 Yeah, but has anyone made a magnet drive fully encased within a convincing looking plane?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:05:01 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 14:05:10 I had a good idea and yet it's still of no use.

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:30:17 He's so shit he can't even replicate from an image
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:30:28 it wheels balls lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:31:44 The most surprising part is that he actually intended to do it before learning it ws bannable
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:33:15 He's talking about the speed cap you can reach before going to limbo, what the fuck
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:34:54 question: was the 1x1 delta wing bug fixed?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:35:29 What about a Huge Super Rocket Engine?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:35:40 What is the thrust capacity on the huge rocket engine comparable to?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:39:18 Ball wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:39:57 Yo, what are offsetted blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:40:35 And what could it possibly be used for?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:40:40 Huh
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:40:50 Is it smaller in all directions?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:40:58 Or is it just the hitbox that changed
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:41:13 You can't notice the size decrease tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:41:16 Looks like a normal block
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:41:35 That makes it hard to actually build efficiently, you gotta keep looking for the difference
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:42:51 How many people suggested the offset block though?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:43:26 We get offset blocks but not light <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:43:31 I'm still grateful for the update though
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:43:37 Thanks for the work rick
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:44:47 Being the tiniest amount smaller than an actual block in just one direction
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:45:03 i couldn't find a very efficient use for that if you have to actively look for the difference
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:45:13 But it's good for cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:49:16 True
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:49:46 I've been noticing some really surprising additions like ball wheels and offset blocks, even though nobody suggested except for one guy mentioned ball wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:50:40 Don't know what that is
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:50:53 Ah, mac problems
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:50:58 I'm familiar to windows problems
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:04 rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:08 hope it fixes itself
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:38 They're literally just offseted from a true block, they aren't smaller
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:44 Just like the name says
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:53:20 Not smaller, just offcenter
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:53:21 
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:54:54 Just basically that
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:55:31 My only question is why use meshes for some blocks, just literally add a smaller block, how is a mesh better than an actual block with its own hitbox
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:55:52 Don't worry rick, he's just joking
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:56:08 Imperial loves to threaten people ;(
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:56:11 It hurts my feelings

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:56:53 You have no idea what you're talking about Fanta
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:58:53 Fanta do you purposefully type like that for l33tspeech or is it really just you
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 21:04:28 date that number flipped around and get your whole life in jail ;(

plane-crazy 2018-11-18 12:10:55 Petition to make half blocks actual blocks with their own separate hitboxes
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 12:14:21 Half blocks are meshes, like rick told me previously
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 12:14:35 I see no need to make them meshes though, that just complicates an otherwise simple job, no?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 12:17:55 Taller corner wedges, maybe?

plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:01:22 it's not propaganda or anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:01:47 got warned for bad word usage for trying to explain myself before posting this video, incase somebody thought it was propaganda
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:05:30 yeah that wasn't actually intended to get me warned
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:05:56 i don't know if it's possible to have it removed, but i was basically trying to say even that dude had his awkward handshake at one point, and that it wasn't propaganda or anything

plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:09:30 To me this bot is a bit harsh on the punishment, it should actually send an available mod a message telling them the subject's infraction and what measures are required instead of just outright warning, isn't that what the mods were hired for?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 23:10:05 Otherwise it will just randomly warn anyone that evens mention the called 'bad word', even though they didn't intend it as such

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:38:12 That is like the classic 'Builderman is my dad'
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:39:24 Guys serious question, does David Baszucki's son get free Robux?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:39:37 Yes, and a dog
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:39:46 His dog gets free robux too
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:40:33 No robux for them, capitalist pigs
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:41:05 Yeah they'll get a ROBLOX card on their birthday
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:41:20 No

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:41:35 Nothing is ever the exact value in capitalism
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:41:39 $99.99
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:41:52 $109.99

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:43:32 Some guy replied 'Sorry I don't speak poverty' to Spanish speaking people

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:47:40 It's only official on 1,009 because of the bots, sorry b0$$
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:48:37 If it reaches 1,009 then we will officially have 1k members because bots don't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:48:54 ONLY ENGLISH IN CHAT
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:49:07 Yeah I guess
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:49:11 Pop the champagne, then?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:49:42 Can we refer mama to rule 10 instead of warning?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:50:19 I'll make a new account for both Discord and Roblox just to join this server again <3
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:50:32 Also I'll name my new account specifically after Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:50:46 This game is just the best and it deserves all the love
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:51:15 *madattak is typing...*
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:52:03 YES RICK
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:52:11 hey rick, do we know what the next update is?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:53:40 Uh oh here comes the complaining
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:54:19 Can we just be grateful for the work rick has put into the game and not question him about every little detail? So what if he's short on time? We're still getting quality updates with little to no bug fixes after being released.
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:54:58 James
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:55:04 When's the space fleet
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:55:41 He's asking if the mods are from the actual Discord company, and not from just this server
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:56:10 
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:56:36 <@!371084808778153984> He said 'suck my balls'

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:57:58 Imperial, don't feel bad though, that just means you're unique
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:58:18 My computer takes 10 mins tops to download and install an update, then restart
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:58:21 What are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:58:44 YEET
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:58:59 Rick you're my favorite, your pfp is just the worse tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:32 <@!251941191463993345> Around 200 to 600 is great if you actually want to control it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:00:08 I would only recommend going above 800 for bigger creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:00:29 Wait w h a t, any vehicle that has the battlebus?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:00:41 🇫 why tho

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:30:33 Dame tu cosita literally means 'give me your thingy'
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:30:50 the literal translation is that
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:30:53 if you deny that you're gay
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:31:47 BANANANA

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:36:50 PREEMPTIVE
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:37:21 I play preemptive doesn't need a dash
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:37:24 Do you play that too?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:37:58 It's like a game with a blank screen, and if you wait .5 nanoseconds it says that the word PREEMPTIVE doesn't need a dash after pre and before emptive.

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 01:02:29 Is that Filtered Dev still messaging me even though I blocked him?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 01:02:59 HUH
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 01:03:24 Strange because the flat earth society said they are all around the GLOBE, and that Mars has been observed to be round aside from Earth

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 01:10:21 Does the wing flex hold itself up during flight?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 01:10:25 Gotta test that Orange
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:19:46 Hello
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:28:13 Olive oil
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:28:15 EXTRA VIRGIN
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:29:00 No it isn't
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:29:12 6 is nearly not enough, BYM has 100 save slots
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:30:03 Yo where's the rest of the delta wings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:30:47 This is a nice addition
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:30:53 No need to act like a child though, vip
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:31:49 Do you want kids running for mods? Because that's how you get kids with god complexes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:32:23 Below 13 = kids
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:32:42 It's a bad idea overall tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:32:46 Most kids are immature
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:32:53 Majority
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:33:04 I'd rather avoid all of it than allow a minority and get fucked by the rest
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:33:26 'Why would we hire kids?' But you did
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:33:46 Exactly for that reason you just stated
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:33:51 Some are mature, even though most aren't
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:34:13 Isn't that literally the only reason you would hire kids?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:34:23 Because some develop their maturity earlier than others
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:34:47 sup chrome
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:34:58 A e s t h e t i c name tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:37:31 ???
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:37:36 Why are you replying to this
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 23:37:40 We discussed that already.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:48:24 But Hawk is openly homosexual, so no discussion here
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:48:27 Are we done?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:50:00 Bruh who the fuck cares if you're a furry or using a pink pfp, if anybody gives a shit then it's a waste of their time, not yours
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:50:22 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:53:02 My only problem is with basement dwellers using anime girl pfps
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:53:45 yep lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:54:04 
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:54:40 It would only not be funny if it was a real occasion, which it isn't
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:54:46 So yes, it's very much funny
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:55:01 Leave that up to the mod, I don't take suggestions from other users
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:55:15 Thanks Imperial
general 2018-11-27 13:56:01 Millenial humour is sad but will never change yet people still complain about it
general 2018-11-27 13:56:24 If you're such a sad husk that you gotta complain about what other people find funny or not then you really have to look back at your life decisions

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:57:25 Thanks bro
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:57:40 I couldn't make the cockpit all out of glass because of the complex blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:57:49 I'm making it full black since you barely ever see the pilots anyway
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:58:09 Yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:58:38 Alright, stay tuned I might post another mid-progress pic
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:59:26 Huh my motors don't work now, rip
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:59:56 Btw, keep the old GUI, the new one might be cool and all, but it's just a gimmick, it's not as intuitive as you think
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:01:28 Testing out the colors
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:11:00 I just gotta remake the cockpit, it's blocking my propeller length
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:16:55 Props look nice so far but I need to make some space for the original cockpit that is now removed, any suggestions on how to add it back without interfering with the propellers?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:31:11 Don't know if anybody agrees with me, but I wouldn't condone doing anything now that might come bite you in the ass in the future, especially since we have audit logs

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:36 If you're really into a build you can get a lot of fun out of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:41 However I tend to avoid boring builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:18 Nah, it's mostly odd concepts I come with that, at the start, I put in the most effort into shaping it up but then I lose hope
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:49 It's so great even the background warped to check it out

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:54:46 go invent
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:54:58 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:55:42 Hmm, I'm wondering if I can make a new kind of system, mostly recreative
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:55:55 No noob it's 7:55 PM, timezones don't exist
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:56:12 That's not even american time
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:57:22 Rick you're so awesome
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:57:55 preservation is key
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:58:03 don't take that a note off pls
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:58:18 EW
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 21:58:22 wash that shit
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:17:19 They're already doable, are you telling me you want premade pieces like Simple Planes? <@461111372239994881>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:17:43 AUTOMATIC CAR DRIVERS ARE INFERIOR TO MANUAL
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:19:08 Use PC simulator keybinds, W and S for pitching up and down, A and D for rolling, Q and E for yaw
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:19:27 Wedges
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:19:40 Yeah they exert little to no drag on a fast plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:20:03 Either more control surfaces or the wing shape is too odd
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:20:21 Smooth flying works best with straight wings and control surfaces located on the back, like the A-10 wing
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:20:25 At least in this game
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:20:42 But you can just keep the last row and hide engines inside your plane for those controls
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:21:08 imperial is not responsible for that lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:21:10 He's just a mod

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:24:56 Rick can we get on/off function for lights? So we can have working brake lights
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:25:26 I mean on/off function already present in engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 22:25:35 Like, it's only active for as long as you hold it

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 23:06:02 Upgraded Hunter-Chopper cockpit
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 00:00:24 If it's not monocoque it's not a worthy chassis
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 01:44:01 THIS DUDE EATING A CAN OF BEANS WATCHING CARS 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 01:51:23 this is me guys don't judge too harshly pls be kind
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 13:31:23 Almost fully done with the Hunter-Chopper
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 13:31:26 
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 13:43:50 No because it isn't a transport chopper
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 13:44:03 It looks blocky because that's as close to the design you can get without ruining the overall look
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 13:44:32 The helicopter itself is quite polygonal
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:00:29 Hi gays
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:07:36 Why is the turbine so blocky and high
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:08:03 It looks nice but I have no idea what plane it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:08:58 I have an F-14 too, I'd show you but I'm not in-game atm
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:09:15 Yes, and they look real smooth on the plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:11:11 I'm looking at russian jets yet I don't see any jet OR plane similar to what you're currently making
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:11:23 All of the turbines on them are low or just under the cockpit
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:12:14 Is that the TU-22M <@!128600291590275072>
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:12:45 Closest looking plane I could find to the one you're making
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:13:04 <@!381263178589536257> It's done, I just gotta finish the actual flying
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:13:58 He's talking about files from somebody's folder that you need to download
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:14:10 I'm tired of download links to somebody's desktop smh

plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:18:06 Stop being annoying
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:18:24 Hawk if you deleted that pfp and replaced it with something else you'd get 50% cooler
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:19:37 <@!128600291590275072> It's actually quite similar, in width and length wise. How many blocks does yours have?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:20:04 320 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:20:08 DAMN BRO

plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:22:59 He forsakened his fuselage to add more jets on the exterior, and that ruins the look for me btw
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:23:06 I stick to accuracy no matter what.
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:24:05 That's because they're commercial beans
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:24:55 What my idea of tasty beans are
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:25:12 Yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:25:19 Bet you americans don't have that
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 21:25:32 Beans is seen as common street food around where I live

plane-crazy 2018-11-29 00:49:14 You're welcome
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 00:49:49 That plane looks like a loaf let's be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:20:37 Random project coming up, dunno what it is but at least it has a e s t h e t i c
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:26:45 <@!270328973056147456> No.
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:27:15 It's a spaceship design, and aerodynamics don't matter in space
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:28:35 Photon pressure, but aerodynamics hardly play a part in that
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:32:43 It's coming together
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:32:53 Thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:33:27 Yeah, it's a fun little concept I have in mind, not sure how effective it would be on the vacuum of space due to pressure release and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:34:06 To exit???
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:34:16 Bruh
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:34:27 If you do land this thing on another planet, do you pretend to stay inside all the time?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:35:03 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:35:22 You're expecting a lot from a simple intergalatic travel ship, this is not a book it's a creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:35:32 Don't you have imagination?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:36:01 Then imagine how it would work in space instead of nagging me about every little detail
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:36:20 If I'll be honest with you, I'm still doubting the cockpit design, but it's intended to be a spaceship, and you'll travel a lot with it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:36:41 Unless It's like Destiny where an opening cockpit isn't needed at all and you just transmat to the ground.
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:45:56 The build is going good
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:55:44 
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 01:56:19 I might do that
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:06:01 Ima about to roast you
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:06:22 I only trust Imp
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:06:29 Or James since he's misunderstood
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:08:58 Is that the Su-666
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:09:34 I might make my giant spaceship jet black to scare other night pilots, but them I turn on all my lights to blind them
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:09:58 That skimmer plane is sweet tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:10:18 Use some more helium so it floats well
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:11:51 It's shaping up :D
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:13:59 It's a meme
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:14:03 The turbines switch sounds
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:14:26 If it already sunk in the first place it doesn't need ballasts
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:14:35 Start with helium blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:14:59 No, you can't set the ballasts to 0
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:15:11 Sam if your plane was already sinking, adding ballasts just means it will sink more
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:15:17 Add heliu m
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:17:53 764 blocks so far
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:18:00 Hope I'll reach at least 1k before finishing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:26:06 By the looks of that you need 1x2 corner wedges
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 02:26:33 looked like a normal block in the picture

plane-crazy 2018-11-30 03:42:16 Or any other bird
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 03:43:08 I agree with awesome. If you strive only for the world record and end with a stupid ass fugly design, you don't deserve any praise because of lack of attention.

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:33:00 It'll be a sad day when elitists join this game just to hate on noobs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:35:32 Fucking weebs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:35:53 What, no
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:36:13 Yeah 'fucking weebs' as in, holy shit not the damn weebs again
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:36:19 Not literally fucking them
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:36:27 We better stop or this will be deleted as NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:36:43 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:37:07 You can ask, but you receiving an answer is up to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:37:25 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:37:29 That isn't a question
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:37:53 Okay where's the part where you ask one question
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:38:12 I don't get it, you were gonna ask something and then just told us an irrelevant story
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:38:17 Take this to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:38:32 Then why are you still replying
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:39:21 I thought you were ignoring me
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:39:45 I hate edgy weebs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:39:56 If someone calls you a weeb, be ready to FACE THE CONSEQUENCES
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:40:01 Jesus man awesomepotatoe agrees
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:40:39 I think you're wasting your time
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:06:38 I made a cool suspension that works good
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:12:55 I always keybind it, I hate mouse flying
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:13:11 You should invert it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:13:48 Question: do you guys prefer normal controls ( W for up and S for down ) or simulator/inverted controls ( S for up and W for down )?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 20:42:38 boing

plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:47:42 I made a P-51 mustang, so hard to get right due to the overall slim profile
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:48:45 E
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 17:50:43 My mustang is so agile I can't even control it what
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 20:00:19 SUPER GAY
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:09:56 I made a P-51D Mustang

plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:12:44 I have a bird's eye view picture too
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:13:46 https://gyazo.com/c9e2c385ce8f340cf716f76ced6b8ecc
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:13:50 Not too thick at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:14:04 It isn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:14:19 If you can do better than mine, and keep it accurate to the real life's version slim fuselage, send me a picture
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:14:24 Until then you have no place to argue shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:14:37 Nothing in this game can be made to perfection
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:14:44 The shapes are limited, no tetrahedra etc
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:08 Then it would be unrealistic
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:31 Not keeping the size accurate to real life
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:46 You can base it off the size of a robloxian, how are you going to measure accurate stuff in this game
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:16:12 Think of a robloxian as the size of person, and I also never implied their sizes were equal
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:16:57 Sounds like you were bashing my creation for no reason other than just for the sake of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:17:02 My bad if I took it the wrong way
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:17:27 Yeah, that's mostly why I was driven to make it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:17:58 ???
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:18:31 Hey I can build pretty decently too, it's not just because I don't have ranks that it means I have no skill. Not criticizing, just saying every one of us is good at their own thing.
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:20:11 Yeah possibly, I might just enjoy arguments idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:20:26 Good luck Point
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:22:22 Btw vipEmpire, I made the propellers that way to properly mimic the shape and size of the ones in real life, as the current in-game propellers are too big and thick for that small of a plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:23:39 o
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:25:23 No problem though, it's looking good so far
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:25:39 If you're making a heavily helicopter influenced cockpit it looks good
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:25:54 Huh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:26:15 I would say starting from the cockpit is definitely the best decision unless you have the whole design in mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:26:25 This applies mostly to original concepts
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:28:31 Could take some inspiration from this tilt-rotor VTOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:28:32 V-280 Valor
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:29:18 If you feel like it'll best the best decision for you, then go for it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:29:25 Don't make rushed decisions tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:29:49 That looks good but I would focus on adding a bit more heft to the rearmost part of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:30:02 like the F35 (cash pit)
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:30:25 Post it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:31:17 That looks mighty good, AND it follows the shape of the glass
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:31:44 I would recommend switching that 1x1 triangle wedge for a 1x2
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:31:50 So it complements the overall shape
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:31:54 What is that
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:31:59 Control surface spam
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:32:47 
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:32:54 Yeah no there isn't, my bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:33:47 Do you want carrier type VTOL or combat?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:34:21 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:36:57 Looks good or should I switch it for a propeller blade? The props aren't real btw
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:45:30 Hey vip can I join you guys?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:45:33 I'd like to fly with you

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 20:35:27 Btw, that A-40 isn't a VTOL, it just lands slowly because of helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 20:36:21 Still haven't gotten my Dare Devil rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 20:36:53 Thanks Robo

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:10:15 That wasn't very cash money
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:10:37 It is american
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:10:54 I already built it once but it didn't turn out good, literally impossible to get the dimensions right
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:11:45 It's good vip I like it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:11:49 Pretty well done
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:11:51 TASTEFUL PLANE
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:12:19 I like simple planes so my opinion might be slightly biased
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:12:54 Yeah, wasn't talking about the game tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:13:18 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:13:36 Moc you can try just using the wing surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:14:06 You can't use half blocks because of the invisible hitbox
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:14:20 The scale is nice tho vip
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 02:14:28 Ah, I also see you're a man of culture, using the blocc head

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:25:04 Fuck dude
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:25:22 You should try meeting some people, make a couple friends
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:26:12 Crap.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:26:17 You gotta do something man.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:26:45 Do you at least get good grades?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:26:58 Yeah, women
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:27:09 awesome do you like women
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:27:23 So you have a girlfriend?

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:28:05 Fuckin' 'ell
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:28:42 Awesome what's your age
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:29:06 **bub**
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:29:13 I'm betting between 14 to 17
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:29:24 Then you're still 13
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:29:49 But if you wait and do nothing, nothing will ever happen just as much
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:30:10 Company is the best way to get through hard times
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:30:20 Somebody you like and that equally likes you is a good way to fix everything
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:30:39 Let's be real, having a gf is not only for the fun of it, you also probably want the status considering your age
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:31:26 Furry, homeschooled he said?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:31:33 Bad grades, dyslexia and social anxiety
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:31:40 Fuck dude you need to tell your mom
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:31:45 She'll listen to you
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:31:53 If she loves her son, she'll do everything to help you

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:33:20 You won't be able to change anything if you aren't willing to change yourself.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:33:45 The longer you stay like this the harder it is for you to realize it's unhealthy, and the normalty of it will set in
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:35:00 We can only give advice and hope for the best, the true meaningful actions will come from you
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:35:25 the 3k players you see are basically the only people that play this game
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:35:30 no wonder it's so low
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:35:55 Swiss, you said you have a sense of humor, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:36:07 If you can, try to be the funny guy in the classroom, even if you don't get good grades
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:36:15 Crack some jokes, y'know
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:36:19 People will warm up to you
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:37:00 You have no idea what swiss is talking about NooB.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:37:52 The overall atmosphere is a bit bland in the game, the building is good though.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:38:07 I would recommend actually focusing on the new parts players want to improve fun.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:38:48 Sometimes people get bored because they can't build what they want due to the parts limitation. If you focused on the new parts players ACTUALLY want ( talking about you, balls ), it would get better.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:39:05 Cya swiss
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:39:38 Balls literally add nothing to aircraft construction
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:39:45 Isn't this game supposed to be plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:39:46 Not ball crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:40:06 Rick, what about parts players have been requesting for a long time now?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:40:08 LIKE INNER WEDGES
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:40:52 NO MONEY
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:41:09 Money ruins fun and makes the game so much fucking boring if you have no freedom to make stuff without money.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:41:16 Stop with the shit suggestions pls
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 13:41:59 I'm only pissed off because I've seen multiple people request money on suggestions and they all have been downvoted to hell

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:02:14 Question
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:02:26 Do I use triangle wedges for teeth or pyramid wedges?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:02:48 
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:03:07 Yeah, I'll use them for some spots
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:03:17 Shark teeth are layered so I'll do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:04:59 I'll do that but first I need to get the full head of the shark down
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:07:54 What do you think of the jaw muscle/bone
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:08:06 A bit cartoony but I like the monstrous look of it

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:11:15 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:27:12 thanks man
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:36:44 
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:37:07 Thinking of making a robot shark, yeah, kinda that
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:37:18 Maybe an alien, radioactive shark will do too
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:37:30 Make it a green and black color scheme with purple flesh
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:38:10 That could work if we get a large number of people to record and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:42:10 when you walking
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:06:02 Do I keep it blocky or make rounded squares for the body?

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 18:17:08 on full ultra
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 18:18:24 Not really, the whole body moves on a single stroke, propelling the shark to the sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 18:21:56 Don't the bullets have to reach a certain range before they can be actually fired? Biting from close quarters wouldn't give it enough space
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 19:03:42 lmao i think i crashed

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:15:04 Some dude just got increasingly salty while I was doing it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:15:12 I never did anything to piss him off, I only landed on his boat on accident
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:16:09 Sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:16:27 Also, that same dude kept bragging about how he could 'destroy me, if only i had muh alt'
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:16:37 If he's so tough, why not pull out his alt and do it right now
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:16:44 Some people just like looking for useless arguments

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:20:11 Yeah it's quite laggy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:20:27 I'll accept
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:22:24 Dude if you msged me to continue this fight, I don't want it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:22:32 He was acting childish so I tried to de-escalate things.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:22:47 Not my fault if he was looking for a fight but it's not on me to accept his constant shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:22:53 No problem mate, cheers
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:23:01 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:23:10 Just don't be hard on him, I understand where it might come from.
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 20:23:20 Yeah we're chill.

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:25:12 Don't you think this game will be a bit too complicated with logic gates, even more for the kids that play it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:25:27 Why not just keep it simple but nice, like SimplePlanes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:26:24 Add a on/off option for the lights, rick

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:49:59 Rick btw sorry for calling you fat, I just realized how that can be a really offensive thing to say
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:50:14 You should take things more lightly tho, my intent wasn't to bully you
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:51:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:51:25 Just like BYM
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:51:30 Wait, no-
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:51:39 BYM didn't have filtered enabled
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:51:52 That's also why it got taken down
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:52:03 yep
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:52:18 Are you being facetious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:52:39 o
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:52:46 a bit, yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:52:55 Fictional design?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:53:08 Stick to the source material
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:53:22 How close are the nacelles on the real thing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:55:50 Got windows on my Galleon now :D
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:56:35 Should I add cannons to my Galleon?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:56:49 Make them move up and down?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:56:52 Or just sideways?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:58:06 Pretty close
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:58:24 mega oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:58:44 CS:GO went F2P
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:04:21 I think this is a good number of cannons
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:04:37 Probably too much
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:06:36 Question, should I replace some cannons with rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:06:53 Kk, I'll keep them for the aesthetic
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:07:42 Yeah but the scale doesn't match that
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:07:49 Would be too bulky, would look weird
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:08:05 Galleons weren't very big, like, say, the RMS Olympic
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:19:40 Quite spacious
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:20:24 'no homo'
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:21:39 OP is a bit troubled
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:21:56 Can he just give the dude bigger blocks, he wants ultra light creations with apparent size
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:23:26 Does the mast look big enough?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:24:23 It is wider
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:24:40 It's perspective bruh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:02 the wideness is good enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:07 Just need to make it taller
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:18 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:26:16 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:27:09 Dunno how to make this mast work tbh, it needs to be foldable so it's tall enough to accomodate all three main sails, but the height limit is fucking me over
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:28:01 Make the height limit about 25 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:28:21 Really?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:28:28 Haven't counted it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:28:45 Make it 50 blocks tall then lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:30:17 I should make the stern a bit more curved up so I can fit the keel to the overall design
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:31:00 Exterminate them, then
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:38:23 Gonna have to make this another day
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:38:51 A serpent, yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:39:01 I'll make it much, MUCH longer
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:39:08 But I'm too lazy to make the folding system now
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:39:48 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:39:53 Too complex for this game?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:41:06 You can't really make this front profile on a game like this without making it looking like a half-assed 3D print

plane-crazy 2018-12-14 15:20:31 I do agree with him though, tank tracks are a pain to make in this game, the blocks are clunky and the motors are too big to make it effective

plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:07:09 I'm thinking of making a Dunkleosteus
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:07:12 If anybody knows what that is
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:07:47 wide rails plox
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:05 nonononon
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:08 keep it the original way
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:11 Not too wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:21 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:24 That much wide would be good
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:08:27 Sufficient, I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:00 Make a pre-made train track on the map itself, and add that as a spawn location, players can spawn already on the tracks if they have a train or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:20 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:23 Good luck Rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:34 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:42 I think for the one on the map, you should use the less wide one
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:09:47 Would look correct to me, imo
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:30:50 GAMERS RISE
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:32:41 Deception
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:32:55 Hectic

plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:34:29 Oh it's the dude
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:34:53 Oh that will be a fine addition to my collection
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:35:23 Why not use the color called Gold that roblox provides
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:35:57 We're all making the same shark
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:36:08 Wait wait, let's stop discussing this idea on the server, I got a better way
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:36:16 We must not keep it public
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 18:36:45 I'll do it

plane-crazy 2018-12-15 19:41:05 Why does following a friend to PVP take so damn long
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 19:41:26 You get insta-banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 19:41:40 As soon as you finish typing his ping you get banned and your keyboard explodes
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 19:43:12 I tried to join DeceptionTime1 through the PVP join friend thingy
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 19:43:16 And joined my other friend instead

plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:34:04 How is that possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:07:44 Despacito did surgery on a shark
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:08:10 'small'
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:20:16 fake taxi
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:31:24 If anything achieves light speed the world ends
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:31:30 Because that object achieves infinite energy
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:31:42 And consumes everything around it
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:31:50 So technically, whoever truly reaches light speed is GOD

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:11:53 Jameson 'Boymahina' Drago
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:11:55 Don't ask me
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:12:35 I want some people to have some PVP dogfights with me, pls
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:12:45 goob
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:13:01 vtol bro
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:13:04 for sci-fi, do vtol
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:13:33 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:13:41 Use hidden engines for pitching and rolling
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:14:07 bro
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:14:09 Like I said
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:14:21 Use engines for pitching and rolling, taking the function of the wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:14:25 So you don't need wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:14:49 No it wouldn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:15:03 Just use some engines facing up/down for pitching
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:15:11 And use opposite engines on each side for rolling
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:15:22 I'll show you a drawn example
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:16:27 Well, then that isn't with me. You want me to make a miracle, so you don't have to sacrifice the looks to add function
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:17:02 You can either A: Not make it fly at all or B: Make it a zero gravity craft, using helium for balance
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:17:15 I did give him advice, but what he wants is something beyond my reach
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:17:23 Making it function and efficient without use of wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:17:52 How would I know if I can't help without trying first
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:20 Do that if you want, Keken
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:23 Whatever sounds best to you
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:19:13 That is extremely difficult, especially if using engines for control is 'too difficult' as well, for him
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:19:27 There's only one option in that case, if you still want it to be reliable but look the part
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:20:28 As for you statement again helium James. I do agree with you.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:20:42 Helium ruins maneuverability of aircrafts, as it constantly tries to straighten it automatically
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:20:52 And the aircraft tends to wobble a lot in flight because of that.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:21:56 Hey, I'm talking about what I've experienced
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:22:04 Those are my conclusions, other cases might be different
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:25:03 Entropy
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:25:44 No, unfortunately, not even the shadows option toggled helps much at all, if any
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:26:12 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:26:21 com

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:23:05 you can actually legally own a tank if the turret is permanently fixed and the barrel is filled with concrete
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:23:20 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:23:25 you can drive it own legal roads, too
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:24:01 imagine having to drive with rubber wheels lmao - this post was made by tank tread gang

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:29:36 pays well to be a good pilot
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:30:04 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:30:06 we need explosive guns
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:30:20 less explosive damage than normal rockets/bombs, but faster
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:30:37 depleted uranium shell guns
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:07 can we have detail pieces, like exhausts that actually produce smoke, so we can customize our creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:15 i want the fucking side exhausts on my merlin engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:28 good idea, too
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:35 for stunt planes so i can track them easier and shoot them down lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:45 stronger
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:31:50 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:32:02 We should actually double the power of all current engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:32:16 How the fuck is a super rocket engine stronger than a  HUGE rocket engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:32:40 That's not a isopod lmao

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:34:54 way less maneuverability
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:34:58 keyboard is instant and easier
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:35:06 also it's flight simulator controls if you have no simulator rig
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:35:15 damn rick that's majestic
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:35:25 ok

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:36:45 We trust you
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:37:13 that's true shrimp
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:37:19 oh right
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:37:20 true
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:37:55 trollgeinious is a nice content creator and releaser, but i think he's oblivious to the fact that the videos he makes have original creations in them that are prone to be copied
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:38:23 Yeah but look at the scale bruh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:38:29 That's awesome but not true to scale
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:38:38 Even though you fit way more details in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:38:42 HOLY SHIT that's fucking awesome
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:38:50 look at the plane circling it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:39:00 basic physics and common sense lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:39:29 See those X's on the wheels? Those are the makeshift 'sprockets' to holster the tracks in place
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:39:48 You mean like Robocraft?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:39:51 With pre-made tracks
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:14 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:14 this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:22 A pre-made tank track piece
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:26 With varying sizes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:28 Too complex.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:40:48 Unless you want fake tracks, that's way too complex to add to this game
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:07 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:15 There can be multiple sizes and wideness
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:22 Robocraft
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:42 can't wait to replicate this in this game tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:51 that race looks awesome
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:41:59 and some people have said a race track will be added
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:42:09 dunno if rick himself confirmed that tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:42:23 i don't want the gamemode
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:42:30 I want a race track in the map so you can test and race freely
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:42:51 Make a map for PVP tho, with trenches
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:43:07 i see a white block
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:43:16 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:43:16 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:43:25 would make elon musk rank infinitely easier to achieve tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:43:43 Shrimp that looks like something hulk would do
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:44:00 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:44:25 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:44:29 galapagos tank
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:44:56 how
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:45:06 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:45:33 ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:45:46 The turret doesn't look too bad tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:45:53 hopefully he remembered to make it swivel
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:02 i use glasses
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:08 lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:13 take cardboard put on car, ivan
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:16 that how you get tank
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:32 in this case
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:34 wurst
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:46 bullshit, combine
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:46:59 'easy
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:47:00 do it then
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:47:32 that's not penetrating the armor
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:47:38 simply because there was no armor in the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:47:57 boi
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:48:12 so
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:49:06 can we have some planes in the chat tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 16:49:11 post your favorite WW2 fighter

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:48:48 This is fucking irritating
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:51:05 I need a wedge to fill this gap, and with actual fixed half block hitboxes, something I've seen rick note is too hard
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:51:08 
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:53:55 Can someone tell me why making the hitbox for half blocks actual halves is hard, at least from rick's perspective?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:54:20 ok i'll wait for the answer
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:55:15 No I don't remember that Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:55:41 Can we hire some dude that can make the hitboxes work, then?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:55:58 So we don't have to bother rick and we can actually punish the dude we hire, because he's being paid
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:06 can we pay rick so he adds the damn half block hitboxes
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:12 then he'll have no excuse to compain
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:29 No he won't
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:37 He's getting paid to do a difficult job
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:38 Basically working
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:50 lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:58:56 bruh
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:59:01 i never said the difficulty changes
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:59:20 he can complain, and we'll stop paying him lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:59:58 I would stop paying my HIRED worker if he starts complaining about a job he chose to do for money
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:00:28 That's like being a garbage collector, and hating having to pickup trash even though you're getting paid
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:02:53 seriously ban the guy making a racist creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:02:56 he deserves nothing less

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:43:08 You're not an authority, Yoko, so you don't have any weight over who does that
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:44:00 I have no place to talk sure, I maybe acted like a shithead sometimes, but that doesn't void my opinion in this conversation
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:44:14 Your fake authority holds no weight here, and you aren't impacting anybody
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:44:23 Your so called 'exposure' is just attention-seeking
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:44:43 I will shut the fuck up once you stop imposing shit onto others

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:45:50 This argument shouldn't have escalated to this point, but Yoko's fucking dumb immature attitude lead up to this.

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:47:19 Because America makes most deadly jets
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:47:25 Maybe not the most maneuverable, MAYBE
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:48:17 Although, when you're fighting in the skies you don't really want a barebones jet that's only good for air shows *AHEM* Sukhois, Migs *AHEM*
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:48:54 I'm not really talking about vietnam vip
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:49:03 but still
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:49:27 some people say pearl harbor was an inside job
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:49:45 that the japanese are innocent because their shitty Zeros couldn't fly long distances
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:49:51 I don't believe that theory
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 03:50:17 Did you know there are more planes in the sea than submarines in the sky?

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:21:18 I have the callsign Uniform Romeo Mike Oscar Mike
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:38:54 There's some dude in my server thinking he can talk other people down
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:39:01 He's not even that good at his own builds
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:39:11 He uses a control surface spam mobile with a bunch of guns
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:39:35 Yeah but this motherfucker is being unironic
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:41:48 We're in pvp so not sure you could join us
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:41:54 even if you could
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:16:50 Look at this dude trying to look cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:17:05 
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:19:42 No, it's vip server I was in
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:19:51 I think this 'cold' dude isn't in the discord either
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:20:06 He's being really toxic rn, I dealt with him but still
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:20:59 Btw, mistake, I'm not in a vip server, in a pvp* server
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:21:16 I've seen him twice now, and he's acted really toxic both times
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:21:40 He uses tutorial tanks and planes and thinks he has any moral to talk shit to others, but I won't be mad, I'm better than this
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:22:13 Ah, nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:22:18 Another typical jackass
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 07:23:08 You do vip, but only if it's ironic. I have a hatred for people that try so hard to look cool when talking other people down.

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:19:47 <@!216371990959882241> what's the server fam don't leave me hanging bro hook a bro up
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:25:25 why do people want to copy creations so much
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:25:39 and most of them aren't even in the discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:25:42 so i can't rekt them
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:28:42 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:28:54 some dude tried unfolding his laggy ass creation onto my base so i blacklisted him
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:29:05 and my friend is just after his base, and his creation unfolded onto his too
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:29:13 so we both blacklisted and now he's sandwiched
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:29:56 i'm allowed to do as i wish with my base, but my friend blacklisting him is beyond my control
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:30:08 not loss
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:31:00 yeah i see
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:31:03 and?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:31:52 also, it's not like i blacklisted the dude for no reason, it was fine until his lag thingy unfolded my part
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:32:20 no, but it was laggy
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:32:40 i don't care what the prospects are though, i'm allowed to blacklist if the user is bothering me
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:35:28 it was out of my control if my friend would also blacklist him, by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:35:41 i didn't tell him to blacklist just to sandwich the dude, i acknowledge that is a dick move
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:35:49 but he did, and they left
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:35:52 no big deal
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:37:43 He left immediately after he did that, so I couldn't tell him to unblock the dude, per say. Sounds like you're trying to blame me for blacklisting him after being bothered by his massive creation unfolding onto MY BASE  <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 01:46:35 Don't use that symbol any way though, most people immediately jump to conclusions when they see it

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:13:24 that seems counterintuitive, won't you require more space to fit the disconnectors?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:15:49 <@!324607962079297536> check if you server is full

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:17:47 yeah plane crazy arena needs a better join friends option
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:18:20 instead of inputting the name of a friend you want to join, instead show a list of your friends currently in a pvp server and how many players there are
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:19:01 still says user not found
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:19:11 ski fy ci crane

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:33 James let's enjoy some obscure memes on <#495286269459300364> pls
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:04:19 James I like the edgy design to it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:04:44 Looks star wars ish and some of his own thought put into it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:04:45 I like it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:05:50 what if he adds a shoulder mounted chaingun that only fits on mechs
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:06:16 lmao fam i don't got school for at least another 2 months
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:06:19 bout to flex
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:05 What's the name of the Mk2
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:42 Make a MkIV, name it Amphitere
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:04 Then do the MkV
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:21 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:51 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:55 Always related to the scalies
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:09:16 Amphitere or Drake is my pick for another dragon related craft
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:09:26 Drake for a land vehicle, since drakes don't have wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:10:29 I would probably name something after Ancalagon, The Black
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:11:02 This is Ancalagon
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:11:36 nah
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:11:43 Jameson is probably like smaug, small but cunning
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:12:01 Smaug is not small by any means but compared to Ancalagon he's tiny
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:12:44 where's his beta form
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:13:06 smaug is the first on the line
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:13:06 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:15:13 I haven't heard of either yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:15:16 Show me the king dragon
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:17:42 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:18:54 i think the most fragile object known to man on earth is McDonald's ice cream machine
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:19:22 Do not anger the tiktok gods, for they have spoken
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:19:51 sad joke

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:20:36 foot
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:16 what if the dude's name is just Jameson
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:23 oh what
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:25 WAIT WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:22:00 dude don't trust that fuckin' alt, fuckin', i believe he's literally the ghost of james haunting the fuck out of this server, preventing me from not being spooked on the first day of 2019
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:28:14 Yo I wanted to see how Jameson behaved when he arrived here
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 06:39:22 i'm scarred for life
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:21:58 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:31:39 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:31:40 F-15E Strike Eagle
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:33:49 His jet is a supposed F-16
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:34:02 I gave him the initial 'blueprints' per say but he did his own twist to it thereafter
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:35:20 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:36:04 because it's the heart of the rotor
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:36:55 stop-
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:37:10 or i'll dm you a furry fanfic made by fanficgenerator
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:37:14 and you won't like it at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:39:06 I saw some guy building a giant wolf head cannon thingy
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:39:15 Would post but took no pics
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:39:53 Nah he made like a wolf/werewolf head or something with wedges for fur and a cannon mouth
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:40:40 Make a Strandbeest
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:41:53 nah something like this stock photo
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:43:05 hey guys 364 days left until new years !!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:43:51 not that easy for some ppl
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:45:02 Why are you so afraid that he copied your plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:45:32 Like I said, I gave freak the headstart for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:45:34 He made the rest
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:49:45 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:54:24 why'd color those half wedges along the canopy blue smh
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:55:27 that is a questionable cockpit design to say the least
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:55:36 If you're cool with it then I'd say just roll with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 07:58:23 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 08:00:36 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 08:00:57 it's fucking 6:00 AM for me

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 08:09:39 So we can end it all and start fresh as space bacteria

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:38:13 Haven't seen a single one of a cat, goddamnit, even my profile picture is of a canis lupus
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:50:48 I've barely seen you talk at all in General
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:50:49 smh my head
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:51:08 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:51:18 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:51:29 I'm talking about Sam.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:51:36 haha
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:51:37 h
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 00:52:19 🦀 __**2018 IS GONE!!**__ 🦀
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:53:33 <@!251941191463993345> Coaxial rotors have two rotors with the blades spinning opposite sides.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:53:42 Like, the bottom spins to the left and the top spins to the right
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:58:45 Looks correct so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:58:59 Give it a try as is and then another using engines on the tips to make them spin
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:59:08 for the engines part, turn off the motors
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:08:31 Jesus christ so many sharks have been created ever since I made mine
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:08:33 Makes me wonder
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 04:13:42 Guys I think I'm lack toes in taller ants
the-dump 2019-01-02 04:35:37 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:04:40 The dude that suggested that was taking the piss
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:07:56 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:10 Or like Imperial said, he's just taking the piss
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:08:24 jesus nut
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:07 So the devs need to cater to your demands because you don't like driving on the ice?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:11 You expect too much
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:32 That's your problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:10:51 You could just use the winter wheels like everybody else, instead of causing a fit
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:23 Like linh told you already, they're near airport, it's a collectible
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:11:59 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:12 Oh, okay.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:30 Then have fun drifting on ice if you'll stand to wait 'a few months' for it to be removed
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:12:55 Just don't make a fit on general because of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:15:12 I'm not going to spend hours on that, and I'd be more than happy to replace all of those wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:15:19 That is just being lazy on your part
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:16:00 Look at goldmax's picture and tell me that such small amount of wheels would take hours
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:16:37 It would take around 30 minutes if all the wheels have their own different settings, but if they just popped the wheels without changing anything on them, it would take much less than 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:16:49 We're highballing it just for kicks but wouldn't take that long
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:43 Lmao no that wouldn't take long at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:53 Just hold left mouse button with the correct paint and drag
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:17:57 l m a o
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:16 That's not complicated at all, it's a spiral
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:39 Yes, and that's not complicated
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:18:46 You're just fishing for reasons to be upset now
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:15 He's a gangster
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:24 Epic gamer
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:19:59 120 is not much at all in this game
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:20:33 Oh, Imperial is absolutely right, instead of going out to the game and doing that right now you're on Discord complaining about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:10 who mentioned lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:22 this boi
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:21:23 smh my head
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:23:00 Oh c'mon, now you're just trying to be a wank
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:23:51 You probably mean elitism, sir
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:24:29 The kind of people that do this shit irks me
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:24:32 btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:24:39 1.Go to wal mart
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:24:46 2.Buy almond
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:25:22 4.Demand wal mart to have more types of almonds to attend to your needs
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:25:38 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:25:44 <@506469726587846678>
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:26:09 <@!282638341290328066>
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:27:26 Honestly this makes me feel bad that we didn't get to explain ourselves after he got the impression that we were being elitists
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:28:32 Probably the way you and Imperial handled it by having comparably small block count and relating it to harder situations faced by you
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:28:41 Not blaming you guys, but he thought of it the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:30:03 He seemingly got offended by that though, hence why he said 'this game is no different in terms of community'
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:30:16 Probably the same thing had already occured to him before
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:31:23 Good night fam, eat a spider
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:36:52 I don't see shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:37:27 Oh wait if I look real close I can see a faint outline of a roblox character
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:37:34 That's because I'm just thinking too hard about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:37:52 For me you're back from school at 3 AM
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:38:08 Wtf I see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:38:12 It's your character
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:38:14 Standing still
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:38:23 Am I just assuming here
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:42:00 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:42:13 Increased brightness and a bit of contrast
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:44:12 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:44:28 Let's see who that ominous figure is
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:45:04 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:45:14 Increased brightness, contrast and fucked up sharpness
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:45:43 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:45:52 It's probably the Roblox marble texture
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:46:45 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:47:05 Imperial has put on a bit of weight
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:30 Fat Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:48:41 Simple
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:50:14 just make it jpeg, easy MODERN pixel art
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:51:00 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:51:12 now wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:51:22 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:51:45 how much width and height?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:52:34 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:52:36 This is 51x51
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:52:40 With limited color options
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:52:56 Let's say an average lazy pixel artist would use about 20 colors
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:53:05 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:53:08 This is the result
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:53:59 50 colors looks closer to reality
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:55:18 If someone did this I'd pay them some serious exposure dollars
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:55:43 I'll give you a shoutout on my Minecraft yt channel if you do]
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:55:44 Kappa
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:55:59 I have all the color codes at hand
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:56:23 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:56:23 wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:56:37 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:56:49 Those numbers are the color codes apparently
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:57:21 I can give you the picture with a grid so you can use an rgb color picker
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:57:35 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:57:55 I input 51x51 and 50 colors max
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:58:07 LMAO
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:58:19 I would actually tile my bathroom as a 3D orangeskii pfp
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:58:44 That you could only get the full view of the d o g e if you manage to shit in the absolute perfect position
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:59:10 2601 blocks, to be exact
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:59:41 But that's the point, ain't it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 05:59:49 So the guests spend as little time as possible in my bathroom
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:00:17 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:01:50 I eat jon, it's what I do
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:01:59 On it, chief
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:02:03 👍
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:03:48 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:03:49 51x51
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:03:55 Just confirmed
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:04:06 why u need height
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:04:17 n o
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:04:54 Make it flat on the base then raise it using engines or helium if needed
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:05:00 Perfect
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:05:06 P I C A S S O
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:05:31 n0
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:05:33 that would be just a doge
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:05:59 But you have much more variety of colors with little to no difference between the shades
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:06:07 The hardest part is arguably the cheeks of the dog
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:06:40 Look at how little difference these pixel blocks have in shade
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:24 uhh idk chief it's starting to look good
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:31 do the 20 colors one
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:35 i'll give you grid
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:39 G R O D
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:50 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:07:58 this is easier boss
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:01 20 colors max
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:19 The difference in shades is pretty noticeable now
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:31 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:34 it's already pixel
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:36 do it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:39 don't be lazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:08:56 I'm going to google what Jame's pfp is
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:09:25 ok i found some unpleasant results
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:09:34 when i googled 'open mouth red dragon drawing'
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:10:17 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:10:23 the easier one boss
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:10:28 you'll spend weeks on the cheeks
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:13:40 Ok I found Jameson's horned dragon profile picture by reverse image searching
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:13:59 Trying to find a good resolution to convert it to pixel art now
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:14:09 The picture is quite old, from 2008, so idk how I'll find it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:15:53 Jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:15:53 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:16:20 James won't like this at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:17:06 https://www.deviantart.com/isdrake/art/Red-dragon-72032151
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:17:24 That dragon is really fucking awesome
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:18:42 Wouldn't look decent if you just doubled the scale to 102x102
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:20:20 this ain't it chief
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:20:30 Doubled
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:20:31 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:21:00 I cropped it to show just what it shows on Jame's pfp
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:21:16 It matches that fam
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:21:22 But there's the discord circle around it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:06 Discord just puts the circle on the middle of the image so it looks like that in the end result
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:22 It's a perfect square if you removed the circle
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:25 Then it's what I posted above
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:43 Hey James, you have great taste
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:23:01 Your dragon is really awesome bro
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:23:35 Pretty sure James already had it himself
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:24:23 It would look good on a 250x250 grid but that's way too much folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:24:54 bruh they're not mine
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:09 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:22 You sound like Elon Musk in your pfp rn NooBaris
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:32 Np
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:33 fam
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:02 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:03 Castlevania
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:15 Orange is the easier of the two
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:24 Idk why James' pfp fucks up so much when pixellated
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:39 thx bro
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:46 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:56 It's harder because it's traditional brush stroke art
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:26:59 Not a digital image
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:27:24 There's not even the eye on a 20x20 grid with 20 colors
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:27:43 The only way it would look good is on a grid beyond 150
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:00 50 colors, 150x150 grid
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:23 For his spaceship sales
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:27 Gotta be ontop of the money
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:30 Gotta be money
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:29:01 shadow the edgehog
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:30:56 This seems peaceful
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:31:48 Yeah the red dragon definitely looks the meanest
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:33:13 Oh, okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:33:20 Imperial make the grid first
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:33:24 don't be lazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:36:03 Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:36:08 Pick another pfp
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:39:47 We're ignoring you, by your request
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:40:26 lmao tim
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:41:25 <@!99607451300548608> What should I pick for the Distance Calculation, weighted euclidean distance or euclidean distance?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:42:56 Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:43:04 Weighted euclidean distance or euclidean distance?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:44:15 tell
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:44:16 me.
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:44:41 Also, CIE76, CIE94 or CIEDE2000?

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:48:06 imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:48:10 you still haven't picked
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:48:39 It's what calculates the difference in colors between the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:48:42 Just pick one
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:48:52 .
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:49:33 That's like a LEGO set
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:50:32 Lego ships do so it must be real life
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:50:54 That's a kinda gay reference

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:56:53 I've played that before Imperial, with some friends
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:56:56 We beat it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:57:24 A dude chasing you in a maze and you gotta escape like a true bitch

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 07:00:38 I brought up the brightness on that photo and i could see it clearly

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 02:47:06 Also how's the pixel art?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 02:49:19 Good luck with it

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:43:16 when u sneak to ur fridge at 1AM to get some energy drink
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:43:38 guess i won't be sleeping today
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:44:02 I just drank an entire 500ml cup bro
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:44:10 Worth of energy drink
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:44:37 ;(
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:44:58 2nd looks good
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:45:18 I know
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:45:27 Precisely why I said the 2nd looked good
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:45:50 No, you're just unoriginal
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:46:00 Doesn't mean it's a bad thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:46:13 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:46:15 Hopefully it's good
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:48:07 Oh I've seen some of these in public versions, that is nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:50:07 Imperial, you're missing one step
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:50:16 1.Go to wal mart, buy almond
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:50:32 Seems to work fine with only 1 person
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:50:35 Albeit slower
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:52:52 I've yet to see a proper robloxian-sized surfboard in this game that actually works without the use of waves
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:53:12 Imagine a whole server filled with people surfing on differently colored boards
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:53:15 Would be a fun event
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:53:43 Not really what I had in mind but good job
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:54:45 I'll give you 40 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:58:54 weight controlled
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:58:57 don't add the seat on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:10:56 you could use a disconnector to disconnect the seat when you're on it, so it's seat-free once you do
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:14:17 Now that is fancy
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:14:37 Once we get moon gravity waves will be a pain in the ass to ride

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:15:29 Haven't got a good impression of you yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:15:38 A proper impression
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 04:15:41 So I can't say much

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 08:32:46 how about elevator block, a straight vertical shaft with a welded block that rises and falls on command, would be good for making carrier elevators
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 08:32:59 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 08:33:00 that's lame

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:58:19 I'm trying to fly my F-35 so peacefully through a normal server, I'm testing it and not trying to show off anything, then 3 douches get salty about it and decide to complain about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:58:41 They know they can't formulate any insults directly to so they just start calling my jet YT tutorial jet

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:59:08 If it was I wouldn't be posting here
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:59:14 ;(
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:59:22 You can do that if ya find the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 19:59:45 TL;DR is: 3 noobs get salty because I'm testing my jet and they think I'm showing off
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 20:00:29 Goddamn how I hoped the three would be in this server
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 20:00:41 So I could roast them and get my last warn of the fucking year <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:38:03 THE ORCA WORKS
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:55:09 James
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:55:16 I'll be uploading my completed orca soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:11:21 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:11:34 ORCA :D
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:11:51 It's leaping
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:12:30 Lol no
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:12:37 I made it as accurately as possible to the irl version
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:12:40 Let me show you smh...
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:12:58 It's perception, btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:13:33 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:13:44 It's long enough in proportion to the head
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:13:48 Orcas have massive heads
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:13:55 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:14:08 I made it that way so I could fit more teeth
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:14:13 The head is accurate
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:14:39 Hey, you're welcome to try making one, but I gave this one my best shot
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:14:54 And I still need James' avaliation on the actual spine mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:15:02 No shit buddy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:15:03 I know.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:15:31 Are you legit trying to still lecture me about Orcas even after explaining why I made it that way?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:15:41 I made it that way so I could fit more teeth, for more chomping
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:15:53 You're trying too hard man
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:16:23 You're being pedantic, I've already explained why I made it such way, it was intentional
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:17:45 <@!295568493166985218> Actual multi-directional spine system in a working Orca: https://gyazo.com/c874797e74225ea340351cbb36c1cd75
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:18:58 No, it would look correct if I made the jaw less cartoony and stubby, like an actual Orca's
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:19:08 The body's fine, the head's just intentionally made to look cartoony
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:19:47 Yeah lmao, it's just way too cartoonized
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:19:56 Like Orcas you'd see in a monster game or something
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:20:14 Xpert, has that made been made before?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:20:21 The multi-directional spine
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:20:52 So if I upload it to creations do I have a chance of getting Inventor rank?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:26:20 Yes orca guy is toxic shark guy
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:27:40 My legs are bleeding

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:31:47 Like a barracuda
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:32:01 I know, neither has the creation from the dude above me
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:32:04 Guess we gotta wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:32:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:32:50 and you're on your way to 2nd chance too
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:33:07 king cobra, maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:33:15 awesome, why hasn't my creation been uploaded yet?

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:13 Speaking about 70's, I should make a shark mafioso
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:23 worm with a suit
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:26 a tuxedo
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:35 I'll do that when I have enough patience
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:42 I'm drained from making this orca
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:37:53 worm
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:38:02 a worm with a tuxedo and corduroy pants

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:40:17 it's a female?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:40:51 Bot seems to be working again
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:40:54 Reupload time
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:41:52 hopefully it gets uploaded this time
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:41:56 ;(
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:14 Dodge uploaded his 2 minutes ago and it worked
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:17 Now mine ain't SMH
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:25 What if I just upload the picture first, then a video?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:27 also, nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:55 yes it's working with only pictures
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:42:58 fuck my life
creations-chat 2019-01-07 00:45:09 fuck off
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:45:17 It worked immediately
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:45:37 Yeah but gyazo won't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:45:42 let me try uploading it as a file, not wmv
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:46:54 Done
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:46:59 Uploaded 2 pictures and a video file, not wmv
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:47:16 rip lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:47:38 Now I just gotta wait for ratings and votes and see if I can hopefully get a rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:48:43 syteam
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:49:43 I thought rob's pfp was stig
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:49:58 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:50:31 Imperial do I get any ranks lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:50:41 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:50:47 i have windows 94
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:50:48 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:53:13 I need James to take a look at the Orca because he seemed interested earlier
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:55:08 more like an anchor
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:55:21 Imperial but he made an anchor
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 00:55:27 He deserves Epic rank 😎
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:00:11 Uh Imperial, can you take a look at my Orca in <#384025409945337856> and tell me if I'm worthy of the ranks I requested? I asked xpert about the spine and he said nobody has made that before
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:00:19 **w o r t h y**
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:27 Wait...
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:32 I've never seen that????
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:37 Is it the yacht submarine?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:49 Yeah I see that now but
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:53 I've never seen that before
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:01 I think it comes with the yacht
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:05 If I'm not mistaken
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:17 Also James, can I get any ranks for my uploaded Orca in <#384025409945337856> ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:26 I made that multi-directional spine system within it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:45 11 PM
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:46 :))
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:08:32 Idk man
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:08:47 You could ask him to show an example of that have been made before
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:09:05 I sweeped through the past history with the word 'spine' and found no references to that specific type other than my own
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:09:36 I searched 'spine'
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:09:42 It brings up all results with the word spine in it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:09:56 I used the term 'multi-directional spine' so it's separated
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:10:10 'speed badge'

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:37:42 hopefully i die <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:38:07 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:38:09 i see...
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:52:24 By multidirectional, integex, I mean be able to go up and sideways simultaneously, each segment can do that individually
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:54:14 Well hey, if I'm going to be picked on for having this rank, then I guess I don't need it? I don't want to be constantly harrassed for simply having it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:58:46 Like I said, take it away if you must, I don't want to be the target of harrassment for simply having this rank, but I just want to know one thing: Did shinxlev ask or directly request for Inventor rank as he uploaded such creation?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:59:08 If he did, then give it to him
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:59:24 I don't like taking the blame for other people's lack of decision, so do that if you need to
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:00:11 You can take it man, it's alright
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:00:31 Good.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:00:37 Finally this fucking shitty hassle is done.

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:45:16 The anticopy blacklist makes the barrier around your base to others 100% opaque, it seems

plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:50:53 Lost my entire progress, thank you so much
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:51:40 There was no shutdown warning in the server I was in, so how can you assume it's my fault?

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 01:46:51 You should stop trying, I did not copy it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 01:46:58 I have no reason to

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 01:50:42 I love the paintjob on the actual heli so I replicated that on mine
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 01:51:41 Mind you I didn't totally base it off the H160
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 01:51:55 But the entire tail boom and delta tail is totally the H160
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:37:30 Show me your helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:39:11 Luxury interior, can comfortably fit 6 people not including pilot
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:39:16 I'll probably make a champagne bottle later
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:39:19 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:43:54 It is broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:43:55 Not just you
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:44:43 If we get smoke trail blocks I can make realistic simulation of an engine fail
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:44:48 And thanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:45:48 Night flight
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:46:25 Airbus H-160
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:48:31 Nicest picture I have taken
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:48:56 Jesus christ he used a wing panel
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:50:06 Yeah I would do that once I get the mastery to make a helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:50:28 James what do you think of my luxury helicopter?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:50:37 I posted the interior above too
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:51:02 Thanks man
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:52:50 Oh wow that's too cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:52:57 Ok granted
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:06 camera engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:08 i wonder...
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:23 No because no other block can go invisible after being spawned
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:54:27 So you'd have stupid floating engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:55:12 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:55:18 Best description
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:55:24 'The one that you abducted me with'
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:59:15 This is why helicopters are majestic
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:05:16 Imperial saw my picture ;(
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:06:33 Can you land here though, Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:17:36 Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:17:41 We trying to land under the map
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:17:43 Upside down
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:17:53 Can your 747 do that lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:18:43 Not a plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:18:47 A helicopter
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:18:49 Which is harder
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:19:03 No lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:19:12 If your helicopter is too stable, like mine, it can't flip at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:19:56 Coaxial rotors are basically the only way since roblox doesn't like single rotors
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:20:05 No swashplate
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:20:06 Just the body
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:23:40 Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:23:42 Where's the pixel art
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:23:51 You didn't make it?

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:24:33 he totally didn't edit that
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:26:12 Yes it is
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:26:17 51x51
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:26:26 Want me to get you the template for the pixel art?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:26:48 Imperial we should have a party thrown for Xpert
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:26:51 For being a cardboard box

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:11 Somebody called my hammerhead 'gay lag master'
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:14 Perfect.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:21 :(
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:27 I had the same thing happen to me earlier
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:34 My DNS was unreadable
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:35:38 So I had to flush it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:36:43 Damn some dudes like being salty for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:37:56 Oh right
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:38:07 Nah it's just a dude being a jackass for absolutely no reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:38:22 Probably had a bad day and is blaming it on me
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:38:34 I don't like being angry with others because that just makes me inferior.
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 07:38:49 Some people just love getting triggered over petty shit

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:45:25 The roof doesn't just curve down that soon, you need to make the hardtop longer
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:02:41 Hello James
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:17:26 But it isn't pay-to-win, it's just a tip jar, you're not paying to advance or be better than somebody else
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:17:34 I don't think you understand what p2w means
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:45:59 No it isn't the General Lee
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:47:12 If we go by that logic, then McQueen is based off a Corvette, therefore the Corvette is McQueen
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:47:35 And no the wheels look good
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:47:43 Rims are fine, I would make the tires thicker though
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:48:09 Make the back one wider and thicker than the front
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:49:17 h
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:53:41 Wait, there is impact detonation?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:53:47 My god

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:47:33 That mech is awesome
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:48:00 Jesus christ he has so many applications open
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:51:51 That means you have to unless you want to be an asshole
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:52:15 He is probably lagging just you, how do you know he's lagging the entire server?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 17:52:52 Use ballasts as a counterbalance for the heavy side
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:00:29 Roblox is getting a lighting and physics update so that's extremely good news
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:02:26 No servers 'carry the capacity of the new lighting'
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:02:37 That's all on the ROBLOX engine, and it's doing pretty good so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:03:08 Let ROBLOX handle the updates people want first and then maybe they'll take a look at what can be done to optimize those new physics and lighting
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:03:11 But no new engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:05:49 That wouldn't work so well Galaxy, as you see, a totally remade engine requires its own programming language, so ROBLOX may or may not switch from their basic modified Lua to something else, and that would negatively affect developers
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:06:32 Could work but what about the millions of developers that have learned ROBLOXs Lua full time to make their games?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:08:05 Lua works very well for what ROBLOX is: a platform for hosting player-made games, it's not spaghetti at all lmao, it's one of the simplest programming languages
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:08:38 Because it's outdated, I never said it's the best
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:08:45 And how do you judge such performance?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:09:29 Yeah but ROBLOX doesn't use the regular Lua
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:09:33 Theirs is modified to suit ROBLOX
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 18:09:40 And thus made it much simpler
general 2019-01-11 18:13:18 Yeah I miss that too, not the safechat but it had some funny messages.
general 2019-01-11 18:13:48 When ROBLOX released the price floor everything went to shit
general 2019-01-11 18:14:01 but it seemed like it was already gone way before that
general 2019-01-11 18:22:04 Oh man
general 2019-01-11 18:23:12 Why is it behaving like a friction pull-back toy
general 2019-01-11 18:27:36 The only thing I played when I joined was Base Wars

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 19:09:42 On my Airbus H160, yeah

plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:11:07 Good
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:11:30 My heli got heavier, but since I used mininum power, just increasing motors fixed it for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:15:29 My Su-25 is much faster now
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:15:42 With only like, 5 super rockets I think

plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:35:07 Max speed 685 going down for my SR-71
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 19:41:02 can't even pilot my double axle rotor helicopter because the motors glitch out

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:31:43 I will carefully carve your skin away from your bones and make a trenchcoat with it
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:32:08 Did you know Dihydrogen Monoxide can be deadly if just simply inhaled?
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:32:40 Hydroxylic acid is very deadly too

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:39:51 Mustard water is a myth

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:53:07 vip chill
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:53:11 It's probably the motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:53:42 It's just slightly concave instead of vectorized
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:54:00 BaDwInG
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:58:06 Could be a lot more forward
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:58:17 You did a good job man
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:59:35 The elevators are way smaller than they could be, the back of the wings are straight rather than smoothly swept and aligned with the plane's fuselage
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:00:28 The fuselage looks fine but the wings makes it look out of place a tad
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:00:35 To me it's still a little bit too wide
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:01:04 Especially when it tapers
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:01:37 Idk man I'm just a perfectionist, even the slightest of curves piss me off if they're not the same as the original
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:03:37

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:46:23 <@!242650210583576576> Stop copying people's creations
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:49:19 You clearly copied my helicopter, block by block pretty much except for the tail boom
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:50:17 
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:50:20 The mostly white one is mine
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:50:26 That other one with red parachute blocks is your copy
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:50:51 And I have proof to back up that you copied me
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:52:00 Still a fabricated copy
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:52:04 Changed to appear original
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:52:49 The cockpit is the biggest similarity
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:52:53 Block by block
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:53:18 
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:53:33 
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:54:42 I don't want you to get banned or kicked or anything man, but I don't want this to go pass unnoticed
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:57:29 That is called modifying a design to appear original
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:57:38 Even though you completely ripped off my cockpit design
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:58:12 Bro don't lie, you even tried to replicate my delta tail
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:58:18 The swept wing tips too
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:58:57 Adding new features doesn't absolve the fact you ripped the design off
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:00 
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:03 Also, there's my ledge
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:21 And you know, I've posted this helicopter in the past before, James
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:03:39 Mine was made first
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:03:43 Check the date
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:04:09 I don't live in the future btw lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:04:13 The month is first*
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:07:46 Why do you have two warning ranks Esio?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:07:56 One is warning 1/3 the other is 2/3
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:16:58 Just as a note, mine also has twin tail motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:17:03 Another detail he copied
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:18:22 Don't ping them both at once my dude
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:19:02 ??
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:19:05 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:19:39 
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:20:05 Who is the dude lagging your server though?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:20:30 As they said they have no real means of doing that in-game as there aren't any in-game mods yet
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:20:40 If the user was in the Discord server that would be easier to handle
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:22:03 I'm trying to explain the situation, not mini modding
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:22:20 Mini modding would be if I explicitly told him to stop and rethink his actions
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:22:28 I'm simply reminding him of the rules
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:22:34 Is there a problem with that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:22:40 We don't have to argue over this
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:31:17 I can make that if I get inspired enough but I don't have time nor the bread
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:31:40 o
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:31:41 good idea
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:32:13 Redo them but make them fold down
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:32:17 Or something
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:32:19 That is doable
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:32:24 Then you have space for the shuttle
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:32:47 Whatever you say

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:34:22 And if uncultured people say 'it's just roblox but red' just say 'it's art'

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:59:44 I have made a few friends quiet
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:59:48 Oh I mean
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:00:12 they vape full time?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:00:46 Vape is less harmful than cigars by a mile but will still damage your lungs
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:01:09 I'm the OG smoker, I smoke o x y g e n
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:01:36 Yeah that can be a major factor
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:01:53 Most people I know say they advise against smoking but never stop smoking themselves
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:02:12 Really a tragic addiction
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:02:21 o

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:03:58 Hope you feel better
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:04:15 It's less harmful than smoking, like I said
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:05:09 Unless you go after the juice with the highest nicotine percentuals that you'd be better off smoking regular cigars, vapes do harm less if you choose the least addictive and harmful juices
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:05:40 Nobody said it was

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:54:11 Danny do you want freshly squozen orange juice?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:55:39 Here you go Duolingo
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:55:54 Can I see my family now
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:57:40 Fun fact: Eating 2lbs of molten nails everyday helps increase digestion of human skin
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:58:26 For people that can't be there
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:58:28 It's common sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:59:12 You don't need to fucking ping me mate
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:59:16 I get your point
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 23:59:46 <@!191664513911750657> <@!191664513911750657>
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:00:16 I am over it sean, you're just holding onto what doesn't exist. I was simply stating you didn't have to ping me
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:00:53 Or you're just inconsiderate
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:01:49 Consider that my slightly aggressive answer could be due to a variety of different reasons
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:01:52 Not just because I have no chill
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:02:08 Anyway I'm not trying to create an argument
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:02:14 freshly s q u o z e n
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:02:49 That wall though
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:04:16 Real human bodies?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:04:35 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:04:37 It's a body
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:07:07 More like hand coordination quality is 10/10
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:08:11 Yeah I'm cooking this body in medium low heat on a nice chicken heart broth
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:08:45 let the dude flex lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:09:33 next you're gonna tell me you have an RTX 2080 Ti

plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:13:27 when people say you're using cheats while you're obviously exploiting
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:15:20 go to www.youtube.com to watch free videos
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:15:25 not scam no downloads
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:15:43 'no scam'
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:15:51 yes i do not want to not die while watching it
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:16:02 if i do not die after watching said video i shall sue you
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:16:20 you mean Giygas?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:17:09 what made it the most unsettling was the theme song for that thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:17:29 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYb9kSCkjE8
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:17:55 looks like both a fetus and a distorted demon face/skull
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:19:50 i was searching around for the original lavender town theme frequency
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:01 and i managed to found a rather faithful copy of it on youtube
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:09 it's not scary, but the soundwaves do mess with you a bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:22 if you're sensitive to such sounds you can feel nauseous, giygas' doesn't do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:38 no l0l
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:49 just bad ear blasting
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:20:57 PG 13
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:21:55 am I allowed to post the original binaural frequency for lavender town here?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:22:32 that sounds like a song i hear in starbound tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:22:45 doesn't mess me up like you said so
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:22:54 the lavender town one makes me nauseous though
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:23:01 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMPW5n-vreo
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:23:51 it is, for real
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:24:21 first time i heard this it made my eyes water and my head hurt
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:24:53 impressive how basic binaural frequencies like giygas and lavender town can mess with you
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:25:13 i'm listening to it on max volume
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:25:28 i'm not as affected by it as i was when i first listened to this
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:25:32 now it's just kinda 'meh'
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:25:37 i get chills but nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:27:11 sounds pretty awesome
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:27:16 i'd use that while playing a game
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:27:32 let's hear it
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:28:19 dm it then
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:29:51 i have max volume on
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:31:59 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBhNP0Bmv8
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:32:20 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:32:29 i took it while you were taking a walk at the park
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:32:49 must've been a coincidence then
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:32:51 do you have any brothers?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:33:00 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:33:05 ARK
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:34:51 dude that lavender town frequency is messing me up again
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:34:59 i feel like my eyes are being pulled from their sockets
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:35:10 wanna listen to it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:35:14 might not have the same effects on you
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:35:38 it's not creepy but the damn frequency is what messes your mind up
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:39:17 shekels
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 00:47:48 There's one dude in my classroom that is an ass to everybody in it and still gets praise
