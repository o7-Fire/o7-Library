creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:37:34 also don't think about condition if you fell off from the cliff…

creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:43:51 lemmie open up roblox
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:45:55 here
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:48:37 also, the skeleton version. total motor lock on this car is 901, pretty intense
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:53:29 anwser is no, because crash physics are toggleable using locked motors, so it won't break.
general 2021-06-09 02:14:51 i recommend you to use independent double wishbone at front, and rigid axle to rear
