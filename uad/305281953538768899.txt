The Tale of endeyfire (305281953538768899)
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:14:00 Micro planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:14:19 >.> has to be less than 30 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:15:11 6 blocks? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:16:08 That makes my head feel like im doing a rubix cube
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:16:37 Was it flyable?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:16:45 Did it maneuver?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:17:08 Cuase that doeant seem possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:17:25 Ima assume, the build the plane seperate from controlls
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:17:40 Well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:18:20 But that doesnt exclude the fact u still need a solid block to hold it all together
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:18:49 And the pilot cockpit would function as a full block
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:19:19 Hmmm...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:19:44 Ill have to try and make one thats 6 blocks or smaller
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:20:05 Cuase a 5 block plane seems possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:20:42 Hmmmmm.... maybe 4
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:20:58 Not possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:21:11 4
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:21:29 Is the minimum for a contr- WHERE DO I GET .5?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:21:49 this makes me questiong everyething.... REEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:22:00 XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:22:18 But yeah, a 4 block plane can be done,
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:22:38 One of the issues i see, is speed.
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:22:56 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:23:03 Becuase having one of those
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:23:11 Without proper wingspan
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:23:22 Grants tremendous instability
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:23:37 Trust me ive made a few planes.
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:23:57 If ur plane is smaller the 30 blocks and u have more than 1 super engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:24:14 Ur plane will subsequently wobble tremendously
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:24:38 Shhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:24:58 <@328413257092169729> slow down fast boi
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:25:06 One small planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:25:15 Just set it to minimum thrust
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:25:40 Whom?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:25:50 Also i like not having a rank XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:26:11 U stole my line
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:26:16 <@224513422161739776>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:26:45 What isnt broken?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:27:03 Dont answer that
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 08:27:40 :bruh:
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:24:10 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:24:19 Also made a 5 block plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:24:36 Trying to make a 4 block plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:25:24 Not possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:25:36 Does it fly?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:25:47 Ligitimently?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:26:19 My definition of flying a plane, is being able to make a lap around the map without crashing
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:26:56 Not flying >:l
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:27:57 
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:28:05 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:28:27 <@260797229068058634> use what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:28:50 Cuase taking a picture of my screen from my phone is about all i can do
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:29:26 I dont have the button "print screen"
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:29:32 And yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:29:56 Oh i see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:29:58 Anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:30:22 A controllable plane of 3 blocks is impossible
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:31:10 Now when can, possibly exclude the cockpit by setting it aside but i doubt u can controll the plane still
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:32:00 If it makes a lap around the map then ill consider it
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:34:22 <@297019145084469248> sure, but its a disfunctional plane.
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:34:50 And, scince we wanna have this debate. Ill say this.
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:35:27 The stable plane is 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:35:45 The smallest unstable plane is 3 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:36:02 And thats the end of this random hunk of story
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:36:26 <@297019145084469248> sound fair?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:38:38 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:38:42 Its called foam
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:38:59 And some have fail
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:39:05 Oh yeah paper
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:39:10 Forgot about dat
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:40:10 Rip
the-dump 2019-01-27 17:48:00 *grabs gun* i got 7 bullets who wants to die as well?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:48:37 >.>
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:48:48 *engages in social activities*
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:08:12 Thats twu
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:08:18 But then again
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:08:21 Rip server
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:09:24 What type are u using?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:10:41 Or u can make a plane that can do a 180 and return to a fullspeed within 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:06 That, will be considered air suriorotity
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:21 Surpurioirotiy
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:24 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:34 Thank u
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:43 That word
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:12:02 I have no clue where my brain was going
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:21:34 U forgot to take off the right segmant of the ship using FTL
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:23:44 Magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:24:03 Magnets need to work
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:24:06 Also simple planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:52:02 The best bomb in the game anyone could make so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:52:11 Would have to be a cluster bomb
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:53:23 Mainly due to the fact that having a big clumb of bombs has the same AOE as a single one. But with whatever shape u have it in
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:53:48 So having a cluster bomb or a carpet bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:53:58 Would do more damage than a single bomb
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:54:25 Now it would be nice to have a damage amplification mechanism or maybe a bigger bomb. But point being
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:54:41 And ill put it this way.
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:54:59 Nothing new. Anyways.
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:56:09 A single bomb can have a blast and damage radius of say. 5, make a bomb the shape of a hat, that hat shaped bomb would still have a radius of 5.
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:57:05 Now a cluster bomb would deploy, spread, and each bomb would have its own radius of 5. Have them spaced out according and ur bombs would have a bigger effect
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:57:29 Or carpet bombing. God the amount of keys i would need for a decent run
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:58:33 They dont atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:58:50 Thats y i said, the best bomb in the game rn is a cluster
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:58:59 I do hope that becomes a thing tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:59:17 God the amount of balistic nuke planes ill make
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 14:59:37 ._. Do u not read what i say?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 15:00:15 >.> that makes me feel bad... ignoring my suggestions and claiming the idea for ur own... darude
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 13:32:40 <@442359445951873074> rockets fly at around 350-375mph last i tested. It could be in the 200s but yeah. Scince most my planes are super sonic, i use them as a mean to blow up anyone behind me. I simply set a few to a diffrent number and screw ppl over like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 13:38:17 <@314383347214319616> sps? Are u sure ur in america and are using mph?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 13:43:35 So do u :)
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 13:44:01 Roblox isnt irl. Maybe u should go play that... <@216371990959882241>
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:14:32 Ur welcome <@442359445951873074>
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:14:56 To increase distance for tail deterrent, turn the rockets around
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:15:33 >.> my main plane is made to tail ppl
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:16:07 <@227555337945743360> thats big....
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:17:09 <@442359445951873074> i mean my supersonic plane, if in combat, is made to tail/chase your plane unless its small. Then its made to highly maneuver and escape rocket attack distance
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:17:46 Rip?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:19:24 Torpedoes are ez to make
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:19:34 Its the thrust that is hard to master
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:20:29 Ima pop in call
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:20:31 XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:20:53 General
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:26:27 <@442359445951873074> WAIT
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:26:33 THAT CARRIER WAS U???
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:27:43 >.> i was playing a game and i saw dat carrier and me and this other dude defended it and landed on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:27:53 And i kept pressing F instead of space XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:29:36 Im now debating on switching my bigger plane to heli props. Tho idk how to rotate blocks to a 45° angle
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:30:50 Heli props is what i dub a motor with wings that normally make helis go up. Scince thats what most ppl use them for
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:31:30 Tho unlike most ppl ik how helis work... google is life...
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:32:48 <@456226577798135808> i was referring to the few who use the as propellers for planes. Ik ppl make helis
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:33:15 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:33:41 Specify next time then
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:35:06 I just wanna know how to roate the blades to such angle to make said prop efficient
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:36:07 <@251995895405477888> no i dont know what that is
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:36:46 <@458451488335986688> if thats the term ur using then i guess so. As i referr the the blades being at a 45° angle
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:37:17 <@251995895405477888> and ik how helis work as i explained earlier. I just dont know how to rotate the blades accordingly
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:39:21 <@251995895405477888> ur pretty simple minded if u think everyone knows the amount of nuts and bolts a helicopter users
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:39:45 I JUST CALL IT A BLADE
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:40:05 Dont but in this arguement sir
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:40:16 Its not worth ur time
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:40:35 One does not simply
Call a swashplate a blade
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:40:38 XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:40:42 Same
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:41:00 Playing rocket league against the hardest bots it ez ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:41:08 Is*
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:41:54 Aside from the rotisserie blade that is
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:42:04 REEEE
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:42:35 Becuase this world got 10x smoller again
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:42:57 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:43:50 ;-; its big anf fluffy
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:43:53 And*
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:43:59 super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:44:11 Submerge them under the water and its bound to speed up
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:44:26 Water is a prick
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:44:39 <@332563936694239232> square
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:44:56 Thats simple.
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:45:47 Now
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:46:11 U could place it in trade for the current propellers u have out the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:46:34 Jet engines?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:46:59 Yeh replace those with super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:49:03 Magnets dont work
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:49:14 Period
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:49:32 Cuase u have 2 seperate engine actions
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:49:44 👌
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:50:06 Ive been told the dont ._.
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:50:17 THIS SMOL WORL IS SHRINKING
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:50:50 Nope :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:51:02 Welp whatever
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:51:26 <@442359445951873074> use magnets on deck of the carrier to catch planes :D
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:53:06 It would
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:53:25 Cuase then i wouldnt have to smack into a part of ur ship to stop completely
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:53:34 Plus with greater engineering
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:53:55 U could make a magnet track allowing u to move planes in and out of the hanger
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:54:30 :0 i even have a super smol plane u could use as a plane u could store in the hanger bay below deck :)
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:55:11 Honestly
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:55:35 I wish VIP servers, if private would allow u to make a build without limits
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:55:50 Well the limit would be the whole spawn area
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:55:56 I wish u doof
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:56:05 I think ur right
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:56:33 <@227555337945743360> maybe add thrust stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:56:47 O wait... we dont have rcs and such
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:56:51 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:57:33 A large set of foldable fins should help stablize it
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:57:58 XD
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:58:26 <@448505589983739914> small landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 14:58:32 Tiny landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:00:58 Maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:01:02 Its standers
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:01:05 Standerd*
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:01:18 Shoot
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:01:33 Now i have the urge to go thru and leave servers i dont touch often
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:01:36 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 15:02:12 Discord servers that is
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:07:45 >.> magnets and springs?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:08:09 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:08:31 This first design i have in mind for such is hard to explain
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:09:02 The table would look like a tic tak toe board
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:09:17 The spring in the mid with magnets holding it together
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:09:38 Hard to explain
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:09:56 Thats becuase tnt tends to not do dat
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:10:04 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:10:10 Dms maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:10:44 <@283338701193609217> a proper railgun requires a large set of speedy wheeles
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:11:07 From the looks of it, its against a wall
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:11:11 Is that so?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:11:36 The picture shown gives the vibe its attached to the wall
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:11:56 U wanna hop in vc?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:12:15 Better explain things...
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:15:10 Magic
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 16:18:53 Landing gear and a smol bit back thrust
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:07:50 Ye
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:08:07 Remember kids...
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:08:15 Guns are tools
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:08:23 Minds are weapons
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:08:57 Oof boxes
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:09:30 Now what i would find inpressive about this gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:10:07 Looks like a diper
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:10:13 Like a huggies one...
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 03:10:19 But without the colouring
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:59:54 Whats the density of the water in plane crazy?
help 2019-08-28 03:01:23 Whats the density of the water in game?

bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:29:27 <@217336009455566848> ive gotten flung from a mixture of block interation and parachutes. Tho i cant pinpoint whatever it may have been, as i was damn well going lightspeed.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:31:03 But thats about all i can tell u. It may include water as well. Tbh i like the bug, and i feel like its less of yalls faults as devs, and more so the game engine just gaining way to may inputs, and outputting u(as the player) at lightspeed as the result.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:31:22 It doesnt happen often, and when it does. Its funny.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:33:18 Unless it becomes a very common occurrence, id sudgest leaving it be, unless someone is able to fix it or finds something evidential to make it noteable.
bug-reports 2019-10-15 09:33:42 (I mean. Common, who doesnt like going lightspeed)
help 2020-03-11 13:17:48 my game keeps saying "account is restricted" for plane crazy, im on a s9+. has the update rolled out completely yet or have i been banned?

bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:46:59 in mobile, when placing stuff in general, shit like this constantly occurs
bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:47:17 it is moderately annoying, and sometimes outright game breaking.
bug-reports 2020-04-15 03:49:51 in this instance, i have a 3by3 opening where im trying to put in the large rocket engine, however, the placement keeps being anywhere but inside the hole, and if it is in the hole, its invalid.

best way to describe this would be trying to put the two north ends of a magnet together.
bug-reports 2020-04-15 09:02:51 <@217336009455566848> i think its more along the lines of where the "place" point of the block is, per say the thruster being 3by3by4. that "place point" being im the back middle which gets abit irritating to place.

id sudgest having the blocks or placement system, for on mobile at least, allow abit of placement leeway. but thanks for letting me know :D

general 2020-04-15 10:57:23 omg someone built a train that uses the rails?
general 2020-04-15 10:57:54 feels like a massive pain in the ass to try and work with the rails tho, given how clunky the map can be
general 2020-04-15 10:59:02 well if it works like that then idk xd
general 2020-04-15 10:59:27 im just very deterred on using any sort of railway
general 2020-04-15 10:59:44 <@287459677611098114> no. i use hover thrusters dammit.

help 2020-04-22 00:42:05 maybe set up a bot? but uhh, im not *that* smart and most others probably arnt *as* smart to dig through their phones and tablets for the screenshot, then somehow convert it to a link.
