plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:36:00 Epic what eould u like to be changed about the rotors
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:37:07 You see with real helicopters the single main rotor's rotational force eould spin the heli
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:37:23 Thats y theres tail rotor calibrated to stop the spin
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:38:00 Re read what i typed
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:38:19 The heli woudl spin without the rear rotor
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:39:10 So inorder for u to only have one set of blades on the main rotor eould mean that u would have to calibrate the rear rotor at a speed where it would stop the heli from going apeshit
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 23:39:32 Now if u would excuse me i gotta piss

creations-chat 2020-06-04 00:06:54 Ello

plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:46:58 You mean tracers?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:47:25 Wdym
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:47:58 It serves the same purpose as the orange tracers
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:48:14 Like actual real life tracers they vary in colour
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:49:08 Accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:49:13 Just like irl
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:49:36 If u shoot a gun the bullet wont go exactly the same place as the one before
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:50:39 Dont all of the tracers act differently
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:50:47 It just so happens that one of them are red
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:51:43 Theure stacked
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:51:45 Thats why
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:52:44 I dont mean to be an asshole but what point are you trying to make
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:52:48 Brief it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:52:59 Cuz i feel like im getting the wrong idea
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:54:00 I dont notice that they are slower than the yellow ones but yeh they vary in speeds
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:54:27 But even that i have plenty of red ones go the same speed if not faster than the orange ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:55:12 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:57:16 No i see it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:57:28 Youre right i now notice it ehen u mention it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:57:55 Idk i guess its to emulate a different round of ammunition
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:58:22 Some weapons have a "practice" round in an ammunition belt
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:58:40 Yeh
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:59:13 I guessnits to simulate innacuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:59:20 Cuz the guns have no real recoil
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 22:59:42 Guess this is a sort of balancing mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:00:18 I think its so that at longer range its not as easy to connect rounds to your target as it is closer at range
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:00:33 So camping far away is not as reliable
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:00:42 Idk thats just my take
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:11:59 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:12:47 We just had a conversation about this...
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:13:18 Its to simulate innacuracy
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:13:31 So that not all of the rounds connect to the target easily
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:13:45 Balance i guess
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:14:06 But idk if you want a definiye answer ask rickje
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 23:21:24 Its too good try making your stuff a little shittier next time please

general 2020-06-12 20:03:42 We dont talk about that here<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-06-12 20:04:15 But yeh i guess rick and madattak got inspiration from it
general 2020-06-12 20:04:36 Lol y
general 2020-06-12 20:05:41 When was plane crazy made
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 01:26:05 
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 01:26:14 Wtf is that bottom suggestion getting hate
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 01:26:24 That idea sounds usefull as fk
general 2020-06-13 01:28:10 No that sounds reasonable, domething like pixel art doesnt deserve to win amongst high effort creations
general 2020-06-13 01:35:24 That giant rick astley is amazing
general 2020-06-13 01:35:46 I hope it awkwardly side steps and shuffles
general 2020-06-13 01:37:05 I think you need to sacrifice ur first newborn
general 2020-06-13 01:37:30 Wait
general 2020-06-13 01:37:33 Ty your pet
general 2020-06-13 01:38:04 Yeh what the bot said
general 2020-06-13 01:38:57 Cannon be cannon
general 2020-06-13 01:39:19 I hope they will stray away from the classic cannon design
general 2020-06-13 01:39:37 And make it a bit more simple like a long hollowed cylinder
general 2020-06-13 01:40:07 Well think of it
general 2020-06-13 01:40:26 Most people have long cylinders on their creation as the cannon barrel
general 2020-06-13 01:40:40 Well this will be a higher caliber version
general 2020-06-13 01:41:09 Maybe limit the number to 2 cannon blocks per creation for balance
general 2020-06-13 01:41:49 That seems a bit ridiculous 10?
general 2020-06-13 01:42:46 But balanced
general 2020-06-13 01:43:14 If hey already only gave us 4 fireworks to work with
general 2020-06-13 01:43:26 They will definitely limit the amount for the cannon
general 2020-06-13 01:43:53 So will the cannon right?
general 2020-06-13 01:44:16 How do you know theyre worse
general 2020-06-13 01:44:38 Especially not in plane crazy
general 2020-06-13 01:45:25 We just use cylinders
general 2020-06-13 01:45:31 To emulate the barrels
general 2020-06-13 01:45:47 Thats not the point
general 2020-06-13 01:47:34 Balance exists thanks to idiots spamming weapons on their creations thats why i believe a limitwd amount of cannons should be a thing

help 2020-06-14 17:02:58 Youre using half wedge downs correct?
the-dump 2020-06-14 17:03:27 Im not suprised
help 2020-06-14 17:04:45 So the front of the main wings you can continue to place the half wedges till the end cuz the bomber's wings there has such a steep angle
help 2020-06-14 17:05:06 The rear part...
help 2020-06-14 17:06:22 Ill think of something but for now experiment with alternating between the half triangle wedges and half blocks with a 4 block gap in between

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:44:47 Hovering? Controling the tilt?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:45:16 So ur fine?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:00 Come to think i my heli got the most votes out of all of my creations
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:05 And its so simple and shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:27 It only got 30 odd votes so not that great
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:29 Brb
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:46:32 Imma get it
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:47:33 Here it is my first heli
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:47:50 Not a lot of upvotes for good reason
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:49:03 <@468915996858515496> you asked for the heli
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:49:25 Not really
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:49:32 But im making a new one
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:49:37 So it do not matter
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:28 Moving mass doesnt contribute to lift
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:43 The lift stays at the same place
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:53 Unless the mass ur moving are wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:51:37 I found that the center of lift is best slightly behind the com in an airplane

bot-central 2020-11-04 11:57:09 ?Suggest [Lockable Motor 2]
[Configurable]
As the name suggests, Motor 2s must have an option to act as a locked motor. This can be of great help when people are trying to toggle lock a piece at a specific angle. Say for example people would like to get a 1x7 beam block into a position where if locked it can act as a 1x7 wedge. With a normal locked motor it can be finicky for a builder to hold the forwards or backwards button and release it when they think its in position, if they fail the outcome won't look right forcing them to respawn and try again. Rinse repeat. With a toggleable and lockable Motor 2 you can set and angle and simply get it into position from a push of a button, no hassle
