bug-reports 2019-12-13 18:27:39 Real shame that roblox does not let you add & remove thigns from the filter as a developer
bug-reports 2019-12-13 18:27:52 Or gives you the option to make glass not make water transparent
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:25 Yeah
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:28 I know that
bug-reports 2019-12-13 21:28:36 I have used roblox studio for quite a lot of time
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:27:50 
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:28:00 Built a jet fighter with lots of helium so it could take off
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:28:03 Works really well though
creations-chat 2019-12-21 12:41:39 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:04 Yeah I just joined a server and I got an alert saying there has been a fix
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:10 And then I got kicked off and could not access it since
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:52:50 Usually all you need to do is shutdown all server instances and wait for people to rejoin not kick them off for 20 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:53:14 Idk tho, this game is plain crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 15:53:24 Ps Elam's plane looks sick
general 2020-04-07 15:54:43 Im more concerned about the fact the PVP servers are down but yeah thats silly
general 2020-04-07 15:54:50 The first egg is literally in your face
general 2020-04-07 15:56:07 This game probably needs a big update
general 2020-04-07 15:56:28 Yeah
general 2020-04-07 15:56:35 Maybe a system to make rockets though would be cool
general 2020-04-07 15:56:44 Maybe with stuff like IR sensors
general 2020-04-07 16:02:44 Ah for godsakes
general 2020-04-07 16:02:52 PVP is updating again lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:00 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:03 I have been getting this notification on every bloody server now and its been 20 freaking minutes, it does not take this long to update servers omg
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:13 Just wanted to quickly vent
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:40 Yeah they look nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:19:55 But I kinda wanted to do some PVP, not get kicked off a server every time I try to join one
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:20:09 Its like im the only one getting this message
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:19 Ooh
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:22 Nice F-35 btw
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:21:39 I tried making one and gave up because idk how to do the intakes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:10 Ah right
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:26 I made an air superiority fighter that fills the whole plot
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:32 I put it on the votes thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:22:40 And everyone downvoted it saying it was ugly and was not a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:23:40 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:24:49 This is the best plane I have (in terms of performance)
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:01 Yeah, thats the plane that got downvoted completely
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:26 Though I used it for a very long time and still use it today because it gives me the best performance in PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:35 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:25:52 I am never uploading my planes to this server again
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:26:06 I guess im that fucking crap at building
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:26:45 Yeah I noticed that everything I make here seems to make people hate my stuff more than on other servers
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:06 I suppose
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:08 I am playing on roblox
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:40 Those brake lights reminds me of 2000 brake lights
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:41 OMG YEAH
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:27:55 It keeps fucking updating, the scripts must be broken or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:15 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:20 So the PVP servers are gonna be down the whole day
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:47 I blame whoever made this updating system
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:28:52 Its not really necessery imo
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:03 No I cant
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:08 Every server I go on kicks me off
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:10 Or tells me its about to update
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:23 Theres literally no reason to have scripts for these, just shut down all instances
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:29:32 Its not that hard to update a game
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:12 Yeah but the problem is you get this warning every single time you join
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:14 No matter what
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 16:30:16 For 30 minutes now
general 2020-04-07 17:48:58 I just got back
general 2020-04-07 17:49:04 Please tell me the announcement means PVP has been fixed
general 2020-04-07 17:49:16 Ah fucksakes lmao
general 2020-04-07 17:49:28 Right im confused, ill head on and look for myself
general 2020-04-07 17:49:40 Im just getting conflicting information
general 2020-04-07 17:50:08 Nah unless you play it for PVP
general 2020-04-07 17:50:16 But
general 2020-04-07 17:50:18 People are saying its fixed now
general 2020-04-07 17:50:38 Well
general 2020-04-07 17:50:49 We will find out once the server tells me a new update has gone live and I get kicked off
general 2020-04-07 17:51:59 Good news, it appears to be fixed
general 2020-04-07 17:52:00 
general 2020-04-07 17:52:39 Honestly though, I dont get it
general 2020-04-07 17:52:54 Why the hell would you make one of the servers unplayable for half an hour to update something
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:12:27 Hi, I have a problem. Im currently trying to build a helicopter however im getting an issue with oscillations back and forth. My helicopter lifts off the ground slowly but then it begins rocking which then quickly turns into violent rocking and then it crashes
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:12:30 Anything I can do to remedy it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:15:57 Wait it has to be dead on doesen't it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:16:03 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:58:55 
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 20:58:57 I wish I was not that crap at building

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 21:04:40 Thanks a lot

general 2020-04-08 08:21:48 Okay thats really cool
general 2020-04-08 08:21:55 This is my best plane in terms of functionality
general 2020-04-08 08:22:23 So yeah your doing quite a bit better than me
general 2020-04-08 08:23:47 Holy shit thats amazing!
general 2020-04-08 08:24:16 Tbh im not a great fan of motor 2 wings since they are just chunky bois
general 2020-04-08 08:24:56 We are not on about my image
general 2020-04-08 08:24:59 We are on about the one above
general 2020-04-08 08:25:16 Because Plane Crazy loves you
general 2020-04-08 08:25:33 (Deleted my plane since toxicity does not permit me to build something short of perfection)
general 2020-04-08 08:27:20 "Q: How can I force rickje139 to add more wedges?
A:"
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:26 <@!428526271664750602> To enable PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:31 Click gamemodes
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:36 You get 2 modes
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:38 PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:38 Non PVP
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:44 Click on PVP or if your friends already in a PVP server
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:28:56 Instead, manually enter their full username into the join friend option at the bottom of the menu
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:29:40 Right, I got a question, why is it physically impossible to increase the sizes of the plot?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:14 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:16 They are hard coded
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:30:46 Yeah, someday in the far future they should rebuild the building system
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:31:25 Sorry, I was just skimming through the Q & A so I was confused when I got to the building sizes and it said for same reason as whitelisty
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:31:32 Good thing Ctrl - F is a thing
general 2020-04-08 08:31:45 The delete plane button
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:32:13 A e r o d y n a m i c
general 2020-04-08 08:32:36 Your mad lol
general 2020-04-08 08:35:18 I heard War Thunder is just a game about grinding and unless you pay money, your stuck with WW 2 planes
general 2020-04-08 08:35:38 Right good, just making sure it hasnt changed
general 2020-04-08 08:35:53 I heard they update the game though so you dont ever get modern vehicles
general 2020-04-08 08:35:58 imo its not worth it, just learn to play DCS
general 2020-04-08 08:36:06 Thats better than War Thunder
general 2020-04-08 08:36:15 Right
general 2020-04-08 08:36:18 No better idea
general 2020-04-08 08:36:19 VTOL VR
general 2020-04-08 08:36:24 Its a real game, look it up on steam
general 2020-04-08 08:36:33 You dont need to be smart to get off the ground
general 2020-04-08 08:37:10 Never heard of it
general 2020-04-08 08:37:19 Pinned it on my browser
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:37:39 Not me, everyone can agree my planes dont look very good
general 2020-04-08 08:38:49 I dont really get the appeal of War Thunder
general 2020-04-08 08:39:12 I tried it once and it was similar to Hostile Skies but less fun, I get Hostile Skies was based off War Thunder
general 2020-04-08 08:39:26 GAIJIN?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:39:45 Really?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:39:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:03 Dont talk to me about oversizing planes, that was meant to be a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:04 It flies like one
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:40:06 But is way too big
general 2020-04-08 08:40:29 Does not matter if you have to grind away your life to War Thunder
general 2020-04-08 08:41:05 Build a VTOL Multi Role Fighter Jet that takes off from the Coronavirus tower
general 2020-04-08 08:41:55 
general 2020-04-08 08:41:56 Okay how about this plane?
general 2020-04-08 08:42:07 Oh lol
general 2020-04-08 08:42:32 Make a staircase that has rockets on
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:43:35 
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 08:43:38 Whats the purpose of this vehicle?
general 2020-04-08 08:44:44 Nah, just plate it in copper
general 2020-04-08 08:44:47 Coronavirus dies on it
general 2020-04-08 08:45:00 Lol thats dark
general 2020-04-08 08:45:21 Your better off posting it in the NSFW section of another server
general 2020-04-08 08:45:31 You probably might wanna take that down actually
general 2020-04-08 08:45:58 This is a fucking server for a roblox game, if an admin sees that they are gonna have questions
general 2020-04-08 08:46:05 Its not that im offended by it.
general 2020-04-08 08:46:11 Yeah
general 2020-04-08 08:46:23 See

general 2020-04-08 08:48:59 Are you a troll or something?
general 2020-04-08 08:49:13 Well funnily enough you posted it on the wrong server
general 2020-04-08 08:49:39 I knew the roblox community was toxic but fucking hell you take it to a new level
general 2020-04-08 08:50:12 When rowdy posted a joke, moderator said dont and he/she said to the moderator to shut the fuck up
general 2020-04-08 08:50:26 <@!308156968550268928>

general 2020-04-08 08:59:09 
general 2020-04-08 08:59:10 Meh, this is the J-31

the-dump 2020-04-08 09:03:28 https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/686313871031402512.gif?v=1
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:08 Why dont you throw away your computer and rebuild it from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:15 Its not easy to redo all the code
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:04:17 Lol
general 2020-04-08 09:04:32 I estimate people only joined for the egg
general 2020-04-08 09:04:36 It makes me angry tbh
general 2020-04-08 09:04:54 It took me a mere few minutes to get it
general 2020-04-08 09:05:30 All my friends played for the egg and told me where it was so I could leave
general 2020-04-08 09:05:36 That annoyed me since I didnt join for the egg
general 2020-04-08 09:05:43 I just wanted to play Plane Crazy
general 2020-04-08 09:06:10 Hell yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:48 Your best bet would be to get a colour picker that can give you an RGB colour
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:55 Then input that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:06:56 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:07:04 I'll see if Krita gives you the information
general 2020-04-08 09:07:53 Nah, it should require you to go through some special tutorial to show a lot of features of plane crazy
general 2020-04-08 09:07:59 It would probably better show off the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:27 <@!564231852391661589> Good news, it does
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:28 Right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:08:33 Did you want the colour of the wood?
general 2020-04-08 09:09:04 Maybe it should show you how to use the building tools
general 2020-04-08 09:09:10 Instead of give you a plane to build
general 2020-04-08 09:09:21 Because then people who play just for the egg
general 2020-04-08 09:09:26 Cannot just use the tutorial plane
general 2020-04-08 09:09:32 Thats not what I said
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:09:57 239 199 164
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:09:58 Try that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:10:00 R G B
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:10:09 Btw, the wood seems to gradient a bit so tell me if you dont like it
general 2020-04-08 09:10:18 Yeah
general 2020-04-08 09:10:20 What I mean is
general 2020-04-08 09:10:23 Only teach you the building tools
general 2020-04-08 09:10:26 So you got to figure out the plane bit
general 2020-04-08 09:10:32 And also tell you how planes fly
general 2020-04-08 09:10:44 So you dont make the least aerodynamic thing in your life
general 2020-04-08 09:10:57 omfg
general 2020-04-08 09:10:58 I give up
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:11:23 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:11:25 Yeah okay
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:27 Try 239 187 147
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:36 Your right it probably would
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:49 But they listed it for the same reason they wont do co op build
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:12:54 I cannot pretend I know how the games scripts work
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:00 But I can tell it would take a long time
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:49 You have a point if they plan too
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:13:50 to*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:14 Welp im about to head off
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:34 I tried to explain something and the roblox community just tried riling me up
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:14:43 and then they were like "cool, we dont care"
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:18 You know how people only join for the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:24 Hmmm idk what to say
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:28 Im just using the colour picker
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:38 I mean like the new players who never played before
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:45 That only comes to get the egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:47 Then never comes back
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:15:56 I had an idea of a tutorial that is like the current one
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:00 But without you building a plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:09 So you still know how to but you are not provided a cheat plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:19 Then they were like "We already have that"
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:31 Last time I checked, the tutorial gave you a plane to build
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:49 Yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:16:59 Stops new players coming just for the egg then leaving
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:02 They have to actually try then
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:07 Hold on <@!564231852391661589>
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:31 132 100 77?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:17:35 I picked the darkest bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:26 yEAH
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:28 Yeah*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:29 I thought it was
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:41 The problem is, the colour picker does not exactly lie
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:22:49 So it could be that is the actual colour
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:24:55 Sorry
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:24:58 Not much I can do
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:25:04 If its too pale, you can lower all values
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:35:37 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:35:41 <@!564231852391661589> Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:36:50 236 229 211
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:37:01 Idk, it depends on your definition of biege
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:38:11 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:38 Cutter missiles?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:50:44 Oh yeah lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:06 The problem with them is that if they go too fast, they lose stability
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:23 I have a plane capable of 400 without diving
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:51:50 I never had a problem with them tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:52:32 Yeah okay, they are a great anti ground weapon
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:52:47 But has any missile effortlessly shot down fighters?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:32 Yeah, I am yet to build an A 10
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:40 You know what this game needs?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:51 Materials that can withstand blasts
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:53:56 But are heavy
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:17 Cutter mines are cutters on the floor
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:22 Drive over it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:30 That's what I'm guessing they are
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:54:59 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:55:08 Pistons?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:59:17 I have a massive plane that decimates ground targets
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 09:59:26 I just have motor 2s and missiles
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 10:52:32 You only need to do that if the house is gone
the-dump 2020-04-08 11:02:18 Dognuts
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:02:34 Lol I have bombers that utilize a fuckton of missiles
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:02:44 You know imma try that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:39 Hey quick question
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:52 I am making a plane that uses Motor II's for control
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:46:57 However I do not know how to get elevons working
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:47:02 Is it possible at all?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:27 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:35 Thx
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:48:35 Ill look into it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:54:05 Lol nevermind Motor controls are complete crap
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:54:16 Its great for pitch but its hard to use for the elevons
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:56:14 Cant, it works the exact same as pitching no matter what I do
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:37 Oh thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:39 That works
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 11:59:44 Just had to flip on inverted
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:00:21 I also figured out that servo is the best thing to ever happen to Motr 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:00:23 Motor 2*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:24 And that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:32 I forgot about me mounting weapons on planes to that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:01:40 Its so much fun destroying the spawn killing cars with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:08:49 Gonna redo the  wings and change the engine placement on this plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 12:08:51 Its been needing an upgrade for awhile anyways
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:43 Damn
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:48 Also what  the heck, gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:46:55 Am I missing something here?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:47:17 Wait VIP servers have gravity sliders?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:47:19 Thats sick
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 14:58:10 I would add trapdoors to it to act as arresting hooks
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 15:07:10 lol
general 2020-04-09 11:26:55 Yeah its how roblox water works
general 2020-04-09 11:27:03 Plane Crazy will never get to implement this
general 2020-04-09 11:27:08 As longa s they use smooth terrain water
general 2020-04-09 11:27:37 Also yeah VTOL's are hard to fly, I have made one but you got to control a hidden propellor to prevent tipping
general 2020-04-09 11:29:11 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:30 omg lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:38 If your gonna edit it, at least make it blend it
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:31:40 n*
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:02 It looks very off sadly
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:09 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:10 Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:32 How would you even get the build imported from RBXL studio?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:32:35 for*
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:33:50 I forgot how beautiful the reflections are
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:08 Honestly Plane Crazy needs a way to adjust reflectancy and transparency on stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:12 We have glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 11:34:22 But its nice to add a *TOUCH* of reflectance
general 2020-04-09 13:47:58 Not everyone can afford a graphics card
general 2020-04-09 13:48:08 Oh I have a quest as well
general 2020-04-09 13:50:08 CPU is completely fine but I don't see your graphics card
general 2020-04-09 13:50:25 Yeah I have a celeron
general 2020-04-09 13:50:32 So seriously, not bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:47:47 Oh no
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:47:51 Its the easter egg air force
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:48:06 Hurry before they make a spawn killing turret
general 2020-04-09 14:48:20 Yeah
general 2020-04-09 14:48:21 Thats sick
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:52:22 It means we're fucked
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 14:53:05 He's feeling the plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:45:51 Idk about how drag works
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:45:57 I think its just weight that really affects it
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:46:13 If your plane is too slow
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 15:46:20 Find some areas to hide some super rockets in
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:18:59 Right I am completely confusion right now
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:19:09 I saw a plane with signs that has decals on
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:19:13 What the flip is going on?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:20:39 If you want my guess its probably by control panels hidden inside the flying wing
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:20:59 Wings are pretty abstract in this game, they dont actually need air below and above it to properly operate
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:14 Yeah this game aint that realistic lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:45 To be fair though, its the best games for building an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:21:53 But holy damn the hard coded build size limits make me wanna weep
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:22:40 In real life yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:22:58 In this game, wings simply give velocity upwards on the center of lift depending on  their speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:02 Thats my current theory on the games physics
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:25 I am not saying thats how wings work, you would have to ask the 2 developers
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:32 But I believe its whats going on
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:41 Lol if you want a death warrant, try pinging him rn
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:23:42 >:)
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:25:04 Yeah I wouldnt advise that either
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:22 I dont really see the point of building stealth aircraft in this game
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:26 They look cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:28 And all
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:29 I agree with that
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:33 But you are not actually stealthy
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:39 Theres no radar mechanics or anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:44 And rockets dont use IR or Radar
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:32:53 They just go for the nearest block in their area
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:20 Man they totally should
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:29 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:43 And to go a bit wild, if they make sensors and *basic* computers possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:47 You could make an RwR system
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:33:59 Hell if different frequencies are possible with radar
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:08 You could pick up certain types of aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:13 Yeah of course they aint
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:17 We are talkinga bout if there were
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:24 Nah, they dont really cut it, you got to control them yourself
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:34:34 And I dont mean rockets, they are kinda cheap
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:35:32 Yeah but I think there would be a bit of fun in building and revising a self piloting missile
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:35:53 Yeah, they are pretty bad tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:01 Rockets propel way faster than most aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:03 At least missiles do
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:20 Sadly but if the game ever gets a rewrite
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:28 This shit should definitely be including
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:43 Also yeah pistons do have arthritis
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:49 Meh I wouldnt count on them rewriting the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:36:54 They got a winning formula as it is why bother?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:40:01 *Roll* stabilisation
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:40:08 He/she means horizontal
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:43:47 Im stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:14 Okay boomer
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:18 Like seriously
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:21 If you think you or anything is stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:21 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:22 Remember
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:26 Im the guy who likes this aircraft I made
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:39 Seriously tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:46 I put this up somewhere it got nothing but downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:44:54 Roblox is just killing my self confidence
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:45:16 This game is amazing but it probably shouldnt be a roblox game due to its community
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:45:26 In fact I can say that for quite a few games
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:07 Roblox or Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:22 Lol no shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:46:49 I found that out the hard way
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:09 Thats why I consider this server to have a relatively toxic environment, I dont consider all people toxic on here in fact most people here are fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:15 But I cannot upload to it without a fuck ton of downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:47:17 So I given up
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:48:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:48:18 Thats why I dont upload
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:32 k I will have a god
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:40 go*
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:50:50 Hmm I think its easier to use the blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:55:49 
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:55:50 Starting construction...
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:13 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:14 k
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:34 You mean motor 1
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:56:39 Motor 2 wont work for this purpose
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:57:56 Yeah, I make heavy use of these, I will take a look
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:58:12 Tho I just realised im gonna need to adjust the fuselage a bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 19:58:47 Lol
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:43:39 Reading the down vote numbers make me depressed: are people really that ruthless?
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:44:03 Lots of the totally downvoted creations look quite nice
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:20 Yeah sadly lol
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:39 I played blox just now for the first time
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:51 It appears to be a stark contrast to this community lol
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:45:57 Eh what can you do?
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:46:18 At least the game is really good
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:47:17 I wanna marry Motor 2
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:47:41 Yeah, better than control panels
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:48:45 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-04-10 23:49:13 Tho the more surface area on the control surface motor 3 you got, the better it is at creating drag
creations-chat 2020-04-11 23:25:44 Until you gain altitude
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:51:54 Omg lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:51:59 That happens way too often
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:52:04 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:52:08 Anyways, I built a thing again
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:39 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:43 N o o b
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:53:56 You sure about that?
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:57:01 Imagine making a spawn killing car and calling someone a noob
general 2020-04-13 09:57:38 I dont think you can say that we are not toxic
general 2020-04-13 09:57:53 "we just think that build is absolute fucking garbage shit"
general 2020-04-13 09:58:00 Adrian_DM_12 2020
general 2020-04-13 09:58:07 "fucking garbage shit"
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 09:59:05 Oh wow
general 2020-04-13 10:00:02 Hey quick question, how do I upload a creation to the creations thing so everyone can dislike bomb something I made?
general 2020-04-13 10:00:28 k
general 2020-04-13 10:00:35 Filxit stfu, I was being serious on how to upload
general 2020-04-13 10:01:32 Lol thanks captain obvious
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:14 So just upload and it automatically puts it on?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:22 Right k
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:02:59 Fighter Jet (Too lazy to think up a name) - Just wanna see how well it does
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:03:22 Now to get into the brace position
general 2020-04-13 10:04:11 oof
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:08:34 You know what, have an A-10 as well, either way im not gonna get any good scores
general 2020-04-13 10:12:25 "fuck furry" hmmmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:14:19 
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:14:20 You were saying?

general 2020-04-13 10:15:19 Back to the kitchen
general 2020-04-13 10:16:15 Furry police wants to know your location

general 2020-04-13 10:17:16 ban dis dude
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:13 Probably
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:27 Tbh though it does not perform too well so I may just replace it somepoint later
creations-chat 2020-04-13 10:18:43 Though I definitely got way more upvotes than I was expecting (more than 0)
general 2020-04-13 10:18:52 Nah thats gay ***
general 2020-04-13 10:18:58 War of the furries
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:19:10 Lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 10:19:24 You dont really have a right to say that someones a noob if your making stuff like that
general 2020-04-13 10:20:07 You prefer them 2D furrys
general 2020-04-13 10:21:32 Why does everyone have to be better than me lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 12:47:37 no shit
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:01 Roblox did that to stop you inputting roman numerals instead of numbers
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:04 Which they dont allow either
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:11 Certain numerals work but you cannot use most of them
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:26 Tbh, the developers need to add a work around that lets you put in numbers
creations-chat 2020-04-13 12:49:41 Tho idk if the roblox filter allows it

plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:44:26 k I was reading and im just gonna point out, when AI takes over our jobs, they have no dead spots they cannot take over, they will take over E V E R Y T H I N G
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:44:44 And after that, governments have 2 choices
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:45:01 Either end jobs all together and give payments to citizens or whatever so they dont have to work
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 17:45:13 Or let them starve and then watch as revolution happens
the-dump 2020-04-13 17:45:37 omg

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:34:11 No comment
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:34:48 Plane Crazy should of been its own game and not on roblox and this conversation is proof.
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:35:58 Plane Crazy is created with the roblox studio although its a game engine, you cant really export it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:36:02 So technically its a roblox game
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:36:44 ...
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:37:43 Your on a roblox server what the hell did you expect?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:38:06 w o w
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:39:12 I will buy it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:11 Check task manager, if your actually hearing it, you will have a task called roblox still running in the background processes section
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:20 Just kill it and it should fix it
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:45 The grain isnt tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:41:48 But I agree
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:42:35 eXoKay lost the right to talk about ships due to their inability to give ships the correct gender: Female or female
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 11:16:02 Hey, does anyone know the short cut to get the GUI back, it randomly disappeared in flight

plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:06:08 I thought this egg hunt to attract a massive amount of people wouldnt of been a very great idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:06:48 I hope so though loads and loads of people joined only for the egg
general 2020-04-28 14:18:08 100 dollars? Freaking hell why would you even buy that amount?
general 2020-04-28 14:18:28 That game seems overpriced

plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:22:04 Is the colours on that flag world war 2 tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:22:11 Oh right
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 14:27:40 Leave me alone MEE6, you sent me so many messages now
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 14:34:30 Lol, I tried doing that once in a server a few years back, that got me instantly banned
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:07:56 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:07:57 Okay, wtf?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 14:08:06 This guy was asking everyone if they wanna watch him hang as well
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 08:49:31 
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 08:49:36 Someone built some strange tower that made green circles
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 09:07:53 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 09:08:01 Thats actually a really good train tho
general 2020-05-02 10:46:40 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/removing-outlines/504226
general 2020-05-02 10:46:51 Apparently roblox plans to remove outlines
general 2020-05-02 10:47:47 Unless they add outlines to the game by other means, yeah there wont be any
general 2020-05-02 11:07:16 Im fine with 72hz
general 2020-05-02 11:08:11 I think players come up in the workspace like:
general 2020-05-02 11:08:22 game.Workspace.FreshAirUniverse
general 2020-05-02 11:09:23 I think it also comes up in game.Players.FreshAirUniverse
general 2020-05-02 11:09:30 But idk what its for so both of these could be wrong
the-dump 2020-05-02 11:33:17 oh god
general 2020-05-13 07:14:53 Hmm
general 2020-05-13 07:15:00 Or is it
general 2020-05-13 07:15:14 "Hey VSauce here"
the-dump 2020-05-15 18:56:53 Are we allowed to post youtube links
the-dump 2020-05-16 00:17:24 Oof
the-dump 2020-05-18 19:33:22 srsly, "wrong format"?
the-dump 2020-05-18 19:33:41 C'mon its supposed to be a joke not some sort of serious application that you have to conform to the law by or something
the-dump 2020-05-18 19:36:56 hmmm
general 2020-05-19 21:48:01 To be fair, outlines were legacy for ages now plane crazy probably shouldn't of used roblox ones however I also don't like these updates
general 2020-05-19 21:49:38 In a strange way though, its really interesting to see this game without outlines
general 2020-05-19 21:59:54 I don't really blame roblox for deleting legacy features but seriously, that new interface makes me want to die
general 2020-05-19 22:00:08 It was out of the way
general 2020-05-19 22:00:25 But now its just blaring in your face your playing roblox
general 2020-05-19 22:00:45 You can't easily feel like your playing another game with robloxs new ui
general 2020-05-19 22:10:23 No not really, they want devs to make beautiful games instead of blocky and stud filled games
general 2020-05-19 22:16:25 Roblox imo shouldn't have intrusive UI like that
general 2020-05-19 22:16:45 Its supposed to be a game engine for crying out loud not a thing to just play with
general 2020-05-19 22:17:08 Exactly
general 2020-05-19 22:17:30 Oh damn
general 2020-05-19 22:18:17 Uhh
general 2020-05-19 22:18:23 Honestly I hate emotes
general 2020-05-19 22:18:47 I feel they should of just been a thing that devs could make not extra revenue for roblox
general 2020-05-19 23:24:45 Oh dear
general 2020-05-19 23:25:28 I'm surprised people don't realise that outlines were roblox not a developer thing.
general 2020-05-19 23:25:59 They won't be bringing back roblox outlines because roblox considered it legacy and I don't think custom outlines are easy to do
the-dump 2020-05-20 20:22:30 
the-dump 2020-05-20 20:22:41 When you want to trade discord account usernames but roblox brrts you with hashtags
the-dump 2020-05-21 19:28:26 ngl my whole attitude towards roblox removing outlines was just <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:55:06 No wonder, that plane looks sick
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:55:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:56:10 I know the game build space is hard coded but we really need bigger plots
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:56:38 Those are wing folds right
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:57:56 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:58:26 Yeah I just don't bother with folds, I can't get an accurate reading of mass and lift with it
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 07:59:23 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 08:03:35 That's how lots of thicc planes look despawned tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 08:15:04 haha fighter go boom
creations-chat 2020-08-31 20:34:44 Thinking of coming up of something more original than an A-10, probably an A-1 Skyraider or something that has a turboprop
creations-chat 2020-08-31 20:42:42 Supra looks pretty sweet
general 2020-08-31 20:57:41 If you want the items
general 2020-08-31 20:57:44 You dont have to pay I dont think
general 2020-08-31 20:57:47 Just wait for the next winter event
general 2020-08-31 20:57:53 You just wont get the 2019 badge
general 2020-08-31 20:58:15 Lol most of the summer and winter crap is just junk
general 2020-08-31 20:58:36 I just dont bother collecting, I only do it if theres a chance of weaponizing it
general 2020-08-31 20:58:42 Which most of the time: there isnt
general 2020-08-31 20:59:17 Oof
general 2020-08-31 20:59:21 Feel bad tbh
general 2020-08-31 20:59:27 Considering the conditions in china
general 2020-08-31 20:59:37 myes tank of gayness
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:01:25 Homing missiles? how do you even make them work?
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:01:38 Most of the missiles I seen just dont work well for air to air engagements
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:02:22 Yep
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:02:22 ^
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:03:21 Oh, im guessing the missiles do not work without a camera
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:03:53 I guess I should try harder when building guided missiles
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:04:00 We could really do with some parts to create our own missiles tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:04:07 Its a shame it wont happen in this hard coded state
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:05:47 Thanks, i'll definitely take a look at it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:16 Im assuming the rocket must be normal and not super
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:35 Oh, awesome
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:06:50 Most missiles I seen go bat***t out of control with super rockets
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:07:03 Are these missiles mouse or keyboard guided
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:16 Just dont bother honestly
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:18 No point
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:32 Dont bother telling roblox that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:33 They probably wont care
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:38 They sure as hell do deal with false reports though
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:40 And I just dont get it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:51 Okay
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:55 Even the mention of it just gets me yeeted
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:15:56 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:03 But someone had that word in the name
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:10 And then when I reported them to roblox ages ago
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:12 I got banned
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:16:24 If anything the person whos gonna get banned is you so dont report lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:17:23 I have a question, I am going to build an A-1 skyraider like aircraft to replace my A-10, does anyone have any tips for making the aircraft as survivable as possible?
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:12 I personally dont see why people do it either but theres no point b*ing on about it
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:31 Welp and in return
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:36 We lost respect for you
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:19:37 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:20:15 Yeah but you did it for something that is kinda pointless
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:21:37 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:21:37 This is dragging on over a word
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:04 gay apparently
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:05 lmao
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:22:27 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:25:57 navumm im sorry but gay is just a word people use for insults, your just gonna have to accept it and move on, we are not changing how we use words. Dont get me wrong, im not homophobic by any stretch of the imagination but once again, its a common insult, sorry but thats just what it is.
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:04 Oh nice, I live in the UK as well
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:19 Yeah but most people just dont care about that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:26 Because they know the person using the word just isnt homophobic anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:47 Same
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:27:57 I have a friend who is gay and uses it as a joking insult
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:28:21 lol
creations-chat 2020-08-31 21:28:21 navumm lets just move to the dump like the people keeps going on about

the-dump 2020-08-31 21:34:50 Lets talk about the shredder bug:
the-dump 2020-08-31 21:34:54 I freaking hate it
bug-reports 2020-08-31 21:36:03 A full on map remake would be better than trying to mess with track that was clearly made for testing tbh. Perhaps in a rewrite in some fantasy
the-dump 2020-09-01 11:03:52 <@!564633856184156161> Hey, just wanted to say thanks for showing me your AA missiles
the-dump 2020-09-01 11:03:58 They work really well!
the-dump 2020-09-01 11:04:01 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:44:46 Hey sorry to butt in but uhh im having weird issues with physics, I have some missiles that were flying stable but now they are just spinning out of control whenever I manuaver or try to spool up the engine. Is the physics inconsistent between servers or something?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:45:02 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:45:04 That likely explains it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:45:05 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:45:09 Roblox lag screws everything I swear lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:53:35 Imagine if
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:53:39 We could make missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:53:46 Like not just the camera person guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:53:55 Like actual self guiding missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:19 Well
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:22 I would hope that its done in modular parts
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:30 And not a simple one block solution
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:32 Lol good point
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:42 Its all hardcoded anyways apparently
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:46 Even the GUI which sounds like bs since
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:47 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:54 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:54 You can easily change it in roblox studio
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:54:59 Its not easy to actually do GUI's in it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:02 But its easy to modify it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:04 Im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:12 Not GUI's
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:18 You can move the buttons around
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:29 What no?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:36 There are dedicated buttons
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:41 That send signals
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:43 If you move it around
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:55:47 Your not gonna screw everything up
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:02 Yes but we arent on about scripts
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:06 We are on about the GUI editor
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:18 The GUI itself is a script?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:26 Sounds a bit over engineered
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:36 Well im not on about changing how the gui works
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:56:43 You can still move a button on it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:06 lol as if
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:10 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:16 Didnt think you would of gotten it anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:24 They arent gonna give you the code
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:33 Oh really?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:57:38 Sounds like a massive fail and a half that.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:11 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:13 This GUI stuff you dont need to script
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:17 You just nede to move it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:20 THe scripting goes into the buttons itself
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:37 Tbh idk, I was just trying to prove you dont have to script everything again
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:38 If you move a button
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:58:53 Creates the gui? wdym
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:59:21 CrushFruitsToday at 10:55 PM
You can move the buttons around
Black_BirdNatureToday at 10:55 PM
bruh
vipEmpireToday at 10:55 PM
THE GUI CAN BE MOVED AROUND
yousuf283Today at 10:55 PM
if u change it everything changes
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:59:33 THis is probably out of context actually
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:59:37 But thats why I went ahead
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:59:50 If theres anything I want
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:00:00 It would be unlimited build space in a new version of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:01:16 I think the GUI's horrible looks can be fixed with some adjustment to the colours and transparency
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:06 I feel even some transparency
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:06 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:09 And less pure black
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:11 Might help the UI
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:17 I mean this still looks ugly
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:25 But eh
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:31 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:38 The GUI could be adjusted to look more modern
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:42 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:45 I hope this rewrite goes ahead
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:02:52 I feel like a full on rewrite would seriously help this game
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:03:28 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:03:50 Plane crazy is toxic 24/7
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:04:37 Then again, Aegis Reborn exists so I guess the whole of roblox in a way is toxic
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:06:10 Looks like everyone but me has a role here
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:06:58 I feel like your just being rude for the sake of it now
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:09:18 Just thinking I should now replace my A-10 with an SU-25 since its pretty overused by now
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:09:42 And I have every now and again got told its a tutorial plane and had to dissprove it to people so uhh
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:09:43 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:09:50 And yes I am **the** below
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:10:32 Yeah that probably explains why people are like "LOL TUTORIAL PLANE" every time I bring it to pvp lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:11:47 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:12:20 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:12:21 Im looking at this SU-25
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:12:25 And I think it looks cooler now
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:12:26 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:13:34 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:13:34 Imagine hard coded game
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:14:20 The only thing I would really want is unlimited build size even if I have to pay a small fee for it
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:14:30 But even that is just too far for this game lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:14:33 Yeah 3 pings today
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:14:44 How do people get 35,995 anyways?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:14:55 I barely run near the limit
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:15:21 Tbh the measurement is confusing
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:15:25 It does not say k or anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:15:34 So im kinda just hoping I dont get locked out of the game
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:15:41 Because I didnt realize my number was actually way above
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 22:15:51 Does it go red when you reach near the limit?
general 2020-09-01 22:16:43 Idek anymore
general 2020-09-01 22:16:46 The measurement is confusing
general 2020-09-01 22:16:47 lol
general 2020-09-01 22:18:12 vip your gonna get banned lmao
general 2020-09-01 22:18:54 yousaf is pretty f**ing unprofessional as mods go
general 2020-09-01 22:19:23 I didnt know that tbh
general 2020-09-01 22:19:33 Why?
general 2020-09-01 22:19:35 Oh
general 2020-09-01 22:19:41 Yeah I just stick with common sense for roblox servers
general 2020-09-01 22:20:35 lol
general 2020-09-01 22:21:04 Battleship please dont encourage the mods to make the slowmode 5 seconds because they probably will lol
general 2020-09-01 22:21:17 <@!163143541160148992> Sounds like what happens when you play roblox
general 2020-09-01 22:21:21 Dont do roblox kids.
general 2020-09-01 22:21:44 Why are people asking for slowdown?
general 2020-09-01 22:22:07 Wait, rickje so if I was above the limit, it literally locks my game?
general 2020-09-01 22:22:14 Is there really no fail safe to clear all data in this?
general 2020-09-01 22:22:41 Im assuming 1 = 1k or something
general 2020-09-01 22:22:44 So im pretty sure im fine
general 2020-09-01 22:22:57 <@!435946988559925248> like literally that I think
general 2020-09-01 22:23:17 Should probably put up a warning on the server itself to people who do not follow the discord
general 2020-09-01 22:23:24 To urge people to start deleting shit
general 2020-09-01 22:23:41 Probably lag
general 2020-09-01 22:23:55 My missiles were having problems with that, its probably why your aircraft is getting wrecked
general 2020-09-01 22:24:13 Nah, we need a missile block that has like instant turning and infinite radius
general 2020-09-01 22:24:17 :)
general 2020-09-01 22:24:51 There probably wont be any way to build your own self guiding missiles even in the rewrite but im gonna dream so yeet
general 2020-09-01 22:25:17 Right, my body is drowning in salt from the plane crazy discord for tonight
general 2020-09-01 22:25:20 gn
general 2020-09-01 22:25:39 Some conversation in plane crazy
general 2020-09-01 22:26:10 Black, you add things onto the end of your sentences like captain obvious and shit
general 2020-09-01 22:26:17 It feels salty
general 2020-09-01 22:27:00 Thats not what I meant but sure
general 2020-09-01 22:27:36 I also break stuff into sentences and type quick but eh, I guess it depends how im feeling.
general 2020-09-01 22:27:40 Anyways im off because no one cares lol
general 2020-09-01 22:27:54 America
general 2020-09-01 22:27:55 Fuck yeah
general 2020-09-01 22:28:13 <@!287779983445721088> alright but where are the anime girls?
general 2020-09-01 22:28:15 Wait
general 2020-09-01 22:28:17 Crap
general 2020-09-01 22:28:20 I screwed up typing
general 2020-09-01 22:28:34 lol
general 2020-09-01 22:28:39 Knew it
general 2020-09-01 22:28:42 Welp
general 2020-09-01 22:28:45 Goodbye but I actually leave this time
the-dump 2020-09-02 20:16:25 
the-dump 2020-09-02 20:18:40 Every day I appear to stray further from god somehow
the-dump 2020-09-02 20:21:22 Wasp got sent to another dimension lol

the-dump 2020-09-02 20:24:27 lmao
the-dump 2020-09-03 08:08:08 
the-dump 2020-09-03 08:08:10 AAAAAAAAAAAA
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 09:59:08 I have a question, the control panels were working properly but suddenly they inverted and become uncontrollable, is there a way of fixing that?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 10:00:12 Wait really
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 10:00:38 Oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 10:00:40 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 10:00:40 Thats so weird
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 10:00:41 Thanks
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:42 
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:50 lol not only does this guy does missile swarming
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:54 When someone asked him how he did it
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:30:58 He began asking for fucking money
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:11 He later went on to say that the guys ip was on the internet
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:17 But I havent really bothered to screen shot it
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:21 Not like im actually making a report anyways
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:46 
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:47 Uh
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:52 Yes
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:31:53 Alfie_V2
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:32:02 Dont really care, go ahead
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:32:05 Its a pvp game
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:32:09 My username is FreshAirUniverse
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:54:07 Seriously tho, Alfie_V2 should become an entrupanear
the-dump 2020-09-03 10:54:16 He would make millions of those totally originally missiles
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:04:39 ikr
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:07:52 Funnily enough
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:07:55 People who missile spam
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:08:14 People are stupid enough to fly into you
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:08:19 Even if you are literally
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:08:20 Tnt
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:08:21 On wheels
the-dump 2020-09-03 11:08:25 With a chair strapped to the side
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:30:18 
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:30:22 Is it bad like this is the best my aircraft can endure?
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:26 Eh, I think people would be like eww the aircraft is terrible because its damaged
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:27 Or something
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:36 Also the roblox community is really harsh on creations
the-dump 2020-09-15 21:31:43 Its like the best you can do is never enough for people
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:40:32 
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:06 Click it and then right click it
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:08 :P
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:17 Then save the image seeing how fantastic it is
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:45 
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:41:47 wait fu-
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:43:44 hMmMmMmMm
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:43:46 lol
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:43:54 lol no
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:43:55 stfu
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:43:58 we only use original memes here
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:27 
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:28 myes
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:41 Thinking of making a helicopter tbh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:45:57 All fun trying to make aircraft but its annoying having to keep going around for another strafing run
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:46:03 Lol
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:47:46 Motorlocking I think it used to get around the size limitations
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:47:52 That comes with hard coding a game apparently
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:02 well
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:04 If you wanna do that
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:07 Just make a flying ball pit
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:08 Like someone did
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:12 They claimed they werent trying to cause mag
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:48:22 like how the fu- how do you think a massive flying ball pit will be lag free?
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:49:49 Honestly im a little confused where all the performance issues are coming from, I never really had to use a powerful computer to put roblox on full graphics settings
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:25 Think my worst computer was a GT 1030 and an intel celeron
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:56 I only really stated my graphics card and cpu
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:50:57 Uhh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:00 Not really, it was custom built
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:01 l o l
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:07 All you need to know is:
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:10 That computer cannot VR in the slightest
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:14 The celeron is worse than the i3
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:17 which is not very good
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:20 even then
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:31 Yeah the celeron is older
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:51:41 Im surprised it was even included in the build
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:04 My current computer is VR capable today tho
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:13 ~~Crying with a GTX 1050 Ti~~
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:19 Eh if you have a GTX 1050 Ti
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:25 You can run VR albiet with some hiccups
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:52:31 Although there are a lot of factors anyways I think
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:40 uh
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:41 k
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:42 lol
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:49 daddymaximus I swear I have seen you somewhere
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:53:57 Wait your friends with my account FreshAirUniverse thats why lol
the-dump 2020-09-16 15:54:41 oof
general 2020-09-30 21:26:03 Who cares, its great
general 2020-09-30 21:26:09 I too love white blocks
general 2020-09-30 21:28:25 ew anime
general 2020-09-30 21:28:53 fr tho im not really a fan of space vehicles
general 2020-09-30 21:28:57 Just feels too sci fi for me
general 2020-09-30 21:29:28 I prefer modern aircraft
general 2020-09-30 21:29:42 Although I am also pretty interested in aircraft from the cold war
general 2020-09-30 21:29:47 Anyways im off
general 2020-10-03 12:54:30 Been told to say ef2b for some reason
general 2020-10-03 12:54:47 Oh
general 2020-10-03 12:54:48 Nice hi
general 2020-10-03 12:57:41 puri chan?
general 2020-10-18 13:56:42 Just a thought, why cant we have a vote to kick button on this game? It would literally get rid of all the shredder bugs because no one likes people who uses shredder bugs in pvp
general 2020-10-18 13:56:52 Thats a really nice ship
general 2020-10-18 13:57:08 Its a shame we dont have unlimited build sizes or anything, its really hard to make planes fit on carriers like these
general 2020-10-18 13:58:05 Wait
general 2020-10-18 13:58:13 Dont you have to have certain roles to be able to even make suggestions?
general 2020-10-18 14:00:58 Yeah I would say thats stupid but that probably makes sense
general 2020-10-18 14:41:44 Does anyone know what is allowed to be streamed on this discord?
general 2020-10-18 14:42:09 Oh neat
general 2020-10-18 14:42:26 Might stream VTOL VR or something, idk im bored
general 2020-10-18 14:42:48 hello, have fun, dont post anything in creations unless your sure its that good otherwise your gonna get downvoted
general 2020-10-18 14:45:02 Are there like rules on different voice channels or are they just all general voice channels but renamed
general 2020-10-18 14:46:00 Theres nothing in rules that describe anything to do with the voice channels
general 2020-10-18 14:47:54 burn it™️
general 2020-10-18 14:48:46 Yeah sorry to say this <@!767393867954651137> but this place isnt very welcoming, better be ready to put up with harsh responses and shit
general 2020-10-18 14:49:28 okay this swear filter is really weird tbh
general 2020-10-18 14:49:34 It allows some but disallows others
general 2020-10-18 14:49:38 Kind of annoying actually
general 2020-10-18 14:50:39 theres a cat in my house thats older than me, the cat is 15 now I think
general 2020-10-18 14:51:22 Cats hate us though, they keep crapping on the floor even when the trays are clean
general 2020-10-18 14:51:37 lol k
general 2020-10-18 14:52:17 Kinda wish we didnt have cats but thats not really my choice to make anyways
general 2020-10-18 14:52:55 lol ***sometimes*** yeah
general 2020-10-18 14:53:04 other times though, they are annoying
general 2020-10-18 14:53:37 You need patience to be able to deal with cats imo
general 2020-10-18 14:54:11 99eryaydude, are you from the UK? lol
general 2020-10-18 14:54:15 Just saw your status
general 2020-10-18 14:54:42 Oh lol
general 2020-10-18 14:54:51 I dont get who decided that wales needed a name like that
general 2020-10-18 14:55:24 cat goes one knot, nyoom
general 2020-10-18 14:56:47 anime: the game
general 2020-10-18 14:57:59 I rarely even use emoji tbh, I prefer to just do :) instead
general 2020-10-18 14:59:02 I just use gifs and videos
