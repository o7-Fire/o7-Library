plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:28:47 Why does saving an empty plot use data?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:30:01 I WAS AT 259,997 AND NOW I'M 260.022
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:30:18 THIS IS NOT OK
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:31:27 How much data does turning RGB saving off and how bad does it look?

plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:38:41 Is there a way to make the motor 2 just follow where on your screen your mouse is and not what you're pointing at?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:39:42 They add mouse controlled motors but don't let you make moving winglets that control the same as the control surfaces

general 2019-09-27 15:51:03 Why did they increase the amount of particles produced by engines?
general 2019-09-27 15:55:52 I always have the graphics maxed, and my planes didn't show particles from engines inside before, now they do.
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 19:37:46 <@386974424538152960> oh really?

plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:25:35 in terms of fps
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 16:26:21 It's "Network receive" that's throttling my fps.
