general 2021-07-17 19:13:34 just me or is plane crazy broken?
general 2021-07-17 19:13:47 no like really broken
general 2021-07-17 19:14:24 I can't change gamemodes 
it randomly just gets dark
hatches don't work either for me
general 2021-07-19 09:43:04 does painting trapdoors change something?
for some reason when I painted them dark grey they stopped working
general 2021-07-19 09:43:34 yeah but that seems to be what happened
just stopped working when I paint them
general 2021-07-19 09:44:38 yeah
general 2021-07-19 09:44:42 I tried another color
general 2021-07-19 09:44:49 still breaks them for some reason
general 2021-07-19 09:45:28 idk if it's even painting them that breaks them
general 2021-07-19 09:45:41 they just sometimes work but mostly don't
general 2021-07-19 09:57:31 lol now one of my motors randomly does the opposite of what I set it to <:pain:644301805534183464>
