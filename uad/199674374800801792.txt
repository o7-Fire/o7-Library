general 2020-05-27 22:28:24 I think the blacklist feature is trash on pvp currently, it makes melee just suck or any sort of weapon that launches bombs or explosives. At least turn the blacklist off when the vehicle spawns like dang its PVP
general 2020-05-27 22:30:01 theres a pvp server
general 2020-05-27 22:30:04 a pvp mode
general 2020-05-27 22:30:10 llike bruh
general 2020-05-27 22:30:33 I wish shots registered and the pvp gamemode worked
general 2020-05-27 22:31:02 I do
general 2020-05-27 22:31:06 thats the problem
general 2020-05-27 22:31:17 Cannons and such
general 2020-05-27 22:31:33 but then people either spam blacklist on pvp and render them useless by staying in their plot
general 2020-05-27 22:31:53 and then when you try to use a stock weapon its so finnicky that its just troublesome to use
general 2020-05-27 22:32:16 I think this game is great, I give it massive props for what it is, but it needs work
general 2020-05-27 22:32:23 I play for the pvp
general 2020-05-27 22:33:07 this game is doomed
creations-chat 2020-05-29 05:10:56 Haha the body combine, the John Deere 7720
creations-chat 2020-05-29 05:11:14 I was going to put John Deere on the sign but roblox censored it so its my new brand
creations-chat 2020-05-29 05:11:17 Jonathan Deere
help 2020-05-29 05:38:28 I mean, depends on how big you're wanting to make the entire thing
help 2020-05-29 05:39:01 <@!597340544548601867> if you want to take on a pretty large build, I'm not robotics specialist, but that seems like a big undertaking
help 2020-05-29 05:39:14 but hey, it looks good so power to ya
help 2020-05-29 05:40:48 Well it looks like a good foot to me
help 2020-05-29 05:41:46 no
help 2020-05-29 05:41:55 it just looks like it's well-made is what I mean
help 2020-05-29 05:43:35 I'd say go for the robot though, if you make one that big with that detail all the way, it'll be awesome

general 2020-06-04 12:33:33 I must not be looking in the right places
general 2020-06-04 12:34:03 I like cars almost as much as I like seamen and trains are cool
general 2020-06-04 12:34:14 I think these smaller communities really give the game a good touch

general 2020-06-04 17:24:13 Boat people
general 2020-06-04 17:24:27 I say seamen for short
general 2020-06-04 17:24:53 Honestly itâ€™s hard to fight planes from the sea
general 2020-06-04 17:25:43 I want more people willing to fight at sea
general 2020-06-04 17:26:02 But nobody wants to shoot seamen sadly
general 2020-06-04 17:26:10 Unless theyâ€™re in a plane
general 2020-06-04 17:27:00 Seamen can be found anywhere though
general 2020-06-04 17:31:33 Hell yes America
general 2020-06-05 09:17:17 It most certainly is!
general 2020-06-05 09:18:03 ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

general 2020-06-05 09:18:23 I like living here
general 2020-06-05 09:18:45 Iâ€™m a dual citizen American-Canadian
general 2020-06-05 09:19:10 America has the best seamen anyways
general 2020-06-05 09:19:14 I mean look at the navy
general 2020-06-05 09:19:59 Yeah you have good boats but we have the best seamen in America
general 2020-06-05 09:20:19 If youâ€™ve ever seen a lot of American seamen in one place, itâ€™s just awesome
general 2020-06-05 09:20:41 We also put our seamen in a lot of places
general 2020-06-05 09:20:48 I like our navy
general 2020-06-05 09:21:20 Thatâ€™s the power of American seamen for ya
general 2020-06-05 09:22:11 Donâ€™t get me wrong, I like a lot of foreign seamen, but I prefer American seamen
general 2020-06-05 09:22:17 I just think we have the coolest navy
general 2020-06-05 09:22:58 Whatâ€™s wrong with seamen, I like seamen
general 2020-06-05 09:23:10 Iâ€™ll say sailors but I just like the term seamen more
general 2020-06-05 09:24:25 I legitimately just have an interest in navies
