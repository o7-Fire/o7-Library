plane-crazy 2020-10-18 11:37:46 hai everyone
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 11:57:35 damn
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 11:57:51 my plane is too big that rblx wont load me in without crashing my game... thats new
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 11:58:41 4.7 hundred
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 11:59:29 xD
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 12:03:19 O.o
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 12:03:20 noice
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:09:26 Ahh yes, 4,700 piece tutorial.. is that a question or a statement?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:12:09 I hand built my C-5 taking up to 6 days, I made 2 types, one was a testbed, proof of concept that the door and then gear works, and after proving such, I made the full thing again

Can you give me a link?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:14:26 Oh I saw that, that looks hideous
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:16:07 I actually never saw the video, I saw someone that made it, it looked soooo terrible, and the good news about mine is that the gear is accurate to the real thing, unlike this one
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:18:47 There 3 parts for this build... But I stg that I didn't use a tutorial.. mine has an interior and the cool ladder in the vertical stabilisor
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:21:22 Imagine making a full scale build that takes 6 whole days, recreating every small detail.. just to have it be called a tutorial build.
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:23:12 I need a vacation... The effort I did on this.... Mine looks nothing like that, I have working gear .. I ALWAYS MAKE ACCURATE WORKING GEAR IN MY BUILDS
creations-chat 2020-10-18 14:25:21 Se ages ago I asked for help in this server to help designing the new gear, I got advise that didn't help at all so I spent the next few hours with a few friends, all working together to design a small reliable gear mechanism that fits in my plane.. and after a while we got one that I placed in the build.. this wasn't just me who made it, it was with another 2 legendary strangers that helped me every step of the way
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 20:49:08 my first post got 74 🤩 thank you to everyone who did it, i actually didn't expect this much and i am soo honoured :3
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 20:57:35 thank you soooo much, i really do mean it, (and yes betterdiscord xD)
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 20:59:31 you know, ive known abotu this with the ToS for a while.. nothing has happened so its all fine xD .. for now
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 20:59:32 but yes

plane-crazy 2020-10-25 06:08:08 > How does that even get enough lift
<@!545793563703640065> 
planes like that use a "lifting body" design where the fuselage is flat and acts like a wing
general 2020-10-25 06:08:16 mmmm
general 2020-10-25 06:08:35 6 >:D
general 2020-10-25 06:08:59 lol
general 2020-10-25 06:09:25 how avout a 3rd generation aircraft
general 2020-10-25 06:10:21 you could go for a simple F-104 Starfighter
general 2020-10-25 06:10:24 ooooooooooo
general 2020-10-25 06:11:06 .. keep speaking fv
general 2020-10-25 06:11:15 O.o

general 2020-10-25 06:11:50 okay
general 2020-10-25 06:12:14 not over rated
general 2020-10-25 06:12:52 why not a Japanese aircraft (maybe no a Zeke/Zero because they are common)

general 2020-10-25 06:19:22 <@!163143541160148992> its a Dassault Super Mystère not a Super Sabre
general 2020-10-25 06:20:08 ahh, my bad
general 2020-11-04 11:38:02 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 10:19:40 i know how to fix the motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 10:20:59 1. you can change the blocks surrounding it to make it not  grab onto them and fail
2. you can put the motor lock inside so it wont show when spawned in
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 12:28:28 oh damn
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 12:28:43 Vungielek, you messed up the livery with the tail

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:27:25 i just want to post this here and show everyone the progress i have done to get to get this ( it folds, but also needs pistons because folding isnt enough xD)
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:27:41 its huge >:D
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:27:50 or.. it will be
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:27:55 its not that big yet
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:30:05 i havent measured so i cant give reference
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 09:31:30 not a tutorial as far as i can see
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:20:24 hai everyone :3
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:21:30 i wanted to ask, half my build dissapears sometimes, i've seen this on other peoples builds. and i just wanted to know why or how
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:22:01 ahh, all goods
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:36:13 yea, so here is my thing dissapearing.. i thought it would be due to oscillation, but i made sure that it wouldnt oscillate however, it still dissapeared
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:36:32 im not going to report this as a bug, i want to look more into it to see if i can fix it
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:40:20 MORE LENGTH
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:40:22 HAVE IT FOLD
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:05:09 what Carrier is this?
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:05:23 (if you said it in chat, i didnt check)
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:08:22 when the kraken is summonned.. it only occurs with Motor 2, not regular motors i believe
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:10:02 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:11:27 just go to your base, shoot him, and blacklist when he comes at you, and unblacklist instantly
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:22:36 just a bunch of motor 2's so they follow your mouse or something, and you can aim it towards something
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:45:42 ooooo
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 12:45:50 those carriers look amazing

plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:25:10 *i cant unfold it before it deletes itself*
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:25:47 ty \:D
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:26:36 Yes. ill get to that when i am done, but i am not able to really do more to it, because if i spawn it in with anymore parts, my laptop will catch fire xD
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:27:57 6000 so far
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:28:08 ~~this is a school laptop~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:29:38 daymm
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:29:40 i like it a lot :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:30:00 its great :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:32:44 I am actually really good with making Landing gear :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:33:00 If no one can help you here, I can sure try too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:33:40 I've made an XB-70 Valkyrie and a C-5M Super Galaxy.. both of these aircraft have "interesting" gear
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:34:03 What aircraft are you thinking to have the gear on?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:35:29 I have an F-105 with retractable gear
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:40:41 do you need help with just the nose wheel or main.. or both?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:45:57 <@456226577798135808> 
I dismantled everything and colour coded a bit to help, the Red is the plane, i changed the control surfaces to  light blue (they are Control surfaces so they dont touch the gear)

The Cyan is the motor and a 1x1 delta wing (so it doesnt touch anything but the Landing Gear Leg and the Motor)

The green is the landing gear leg, and that is a blue trapdoor as a landing gear door if you need to use it (connected by a 1x2 text block and a wing trail block
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:46:00 I hope this helps you :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:48:13 All goods :3 .. there is a little bit of motor lock by the way (just lifting the control surfaces by a half) but you dont need motor lock at all to make this
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:50:57 this is what it looks like when in build mode (i removed the control surfaces) and changed the motor 2 to a weird green. the green and pink is disconnectors, i lose the pink parts with a click when i spawn in :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:54:18 All goods :3
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 06:59:43 sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:03:35 (i just need to repaint it to those colours xD, cuz i didnt want to save it)
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:06:49 (i highlighted a blue to see the gaps, because there is some
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:07:25 if you were using full blocks, you can easily make it without the holes using the 1x0.9 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 07:07:33 this is an F-105D Thunderchief

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 05:01:38 i am thinking of 3, but my laptop sucks to load this

creations-chat 2021-04-13 06:38:54 the livery looks sicc :3 i likt it a lot actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:49:07 Well, i have to make it fold, and it folds from above
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:49:10 .. this means that the other carriages also fold from above xD
creations-chat 2021-04-13 06:50:12 If anyone has feedback for my Patrol Boat, plez give :3
I do not mind constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:51:19 I have this image here, of my New York Central Hudson (which i am still working on)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:51:26 and this is the folding mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:51:40 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:52:13 so there are 2 locked motors (the white ones) that will fill in the gap when this is folded in, and the black motor which folds the whole section
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:53:16 it looks like this from above and when spawned
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 06:53:41 (dont mind me spawning over the water, i was submitting a boat into <#384025409945337856> and i didnt change the locationxD

bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:49:50 I've never seen this before, the oscilations of my inner elevons
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:53:26 I do not think it is lag.. I mean, my build is going slow when i record, but it occurs at normal speeds
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:55:54 They aren't directly connected to any motor locks, but could be affected by it. but this has never happened before
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:09 it still occurs at 100, ill go to 30 tho
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:30 it doesn't jam tho.. it just oscillates
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:57:58 yep, still at 30 \:(
bug-reports 2021-06-07 12:58:40 This motor is directly connected to the aircraft body itself, not connected to any other motors
bug-reports 2021-06-07 13:00:43 Not yet, I'm in a VIP server :>

creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:53:49 I've tried putting the name on the side, but it seems like every effort i make into it makes it look worse
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:55:56 I understand it is plain without the text, but i feel like it looks really bad with it, I cant find a way to make it work, although i have been trying
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:57:58 Alright, I can see what I can do with the nose, thanks for the feedback :>

Yea, i've also looked into that, i think the best i can do is motor lock, but i've tried that and it still looks really weird
creations-chat 2021-08-12 11:27:13 Sure, But I'm a bit busy right now, If you remind me tomorrow I can, DM me if you really want to (I doubt you or I will remember this tomorrow)

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 13:11:40 motor lock here
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 13:12:07 what scale is your build, can i see an image?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 13:12:43 oh.. cuz i was going to say that you could use half blocks to get a better shape
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 13:15:52 i was thinking it could be sideways ngl
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 13:16:04 with a bit of motor lock, you could get it to look right
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 07:18:30 not a suggestion but these terminals might want to increase the capacity xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 07:18:56 thanks :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 07:20:39 xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 07:20:49 it's taller than the tower xD

plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:47:01 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:47:59 Hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:48:04 I've invented something
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:48:34 well, yea
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:48:44 i've looked up everything regarding the thing i've made
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:48:59 and only one result pops up of someone not being able to make it
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:49:07 .. i made it
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:50:17 welll.... idk if i should say it cuz i don't want others to suddenly invent it
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:52:09 alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:52:21 I've invented the first 7 Bladed Helicopter Swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:52:43 well, you can looked up those words to see if anyone has
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:53:20 well, i can make a 9 bladed one then
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:54:12 someone has already made a 9 bladed \:(
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:54:19 well, i still got the first 7 bladed
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:54:35 because 8 is easy, it's just 2 4's
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:55:22 can you ... umm.. define that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:55:33 i looked it up ages ago but i kinda forgot 😅
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:56:27 sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:57:46 
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:59:19 it has the whole swashplate on it tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:59:35 ... and rockets because motors spin the body of the heli
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:07:03 waitaminute
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:09:36 i just drew this - so, imma let you define what i have... 
- The blade is connected to a motor that's connected to the central hub - the rockets turn the blades and it lies on a swashplate that moves depending on your control input, which increases the pitch of the blades
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:13:31 i apparently dont
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:13:39 xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:13:48 ok, so my thing is a swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:37:13 i .. umm
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:37:36 i have removed all the rockets, jets, motors, disconnectors, pistons
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:37:42 but my aircraft still summons the kraken
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:37:45 hello
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:39:56 no, i looked at the part list, they're all accounted for
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:41:20 its... it's the wings/???
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:41:30 huhhhhhhhhh?
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:44:54 i removed the wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:44:57 AND IT WORKS???
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:45:05 how do i make a plane, WITHOUT WINGS
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:46:34 well, it's a lifting body design so whats left looks like a dorito
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:55:10 whoops
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:56:34 
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:56:46 i can never get it to work
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 06:36:34 your*
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 06:48:21 Hey uhhh when was the last update of this game
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 06:49:14 hmmm - because whenever i build, the block placement thingy moves to some abnoxious place, so it's so much slower to build now
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:02:54 yea, the abnoxious block placement is just.. kind of annoying me
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:11:23 I.. um.. not exactly
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:11:40 If you mean at building, no.. i'm good
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:12:06 because an update or something has changed the game a bit, so the building process is slower
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:13:45 so, when you're building, you have the block placement highlight in the green, previously, this green box stayed relatively still when you want to place it - but now it sometimes moves
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:14:01 and i have to slow down so i don't place blocks where i dont want them
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:14:45 I dont know if this is a recent update or anything because this is the first time i'm playing in a few months
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:15:35 ahhh alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:16:13 yea.. i don't like it because i can't speedrun building - not that i have tried, but i am slow at building now 😕
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:17:35 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:18:45 lowkey want to see it again
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:19:09 actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:19:11 dw about it
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:24:33 I got a C-5
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:24:42 yea.. it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:24:52 it's really outdated to my current building level too
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:25:12 i still have it because its a memory of one of my first creations
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:35:38 motor lock some wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:35:48 trial and error :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:38:39 a Saab 340 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 07:38:56 with AWAC stuff thrown in - idk the specific name
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 08:47:28 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 23:50:07 does anyone know the dimensions of the plot off of the top of their head?
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 23:50:14 ooo 2ypes
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 23:50:16 hello

creations-chat 2021-10-21 23:06:51 <@!662306868567343105> i saw you in a public server with the golden glider - it looked so sick, i really like what you've done with the back too
creations-chat 2021-10-22 00:34:40 well, it just throttles up and slides really
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 00:36:32 wew

general 2021-10-22 00:39:02 Hello :>
general 2021-10-22 00:44:20 damn
general 2021-10-22 00:44:25 please do
general 2021-10-22 00:53:00 you've summoned the kraken, i personally have no clue whats wrong in your video, but the use of motor 2's always break the game like this - i usually only have this occur on my MiL-35 and XB-70
general 2021-10-22 00:53:59 how fast are they moving?
general 2021-10-22 00:54:23 i see that the wing isnt touching the wing base also the motor might be touching the wing base and causing this issue
general 2021-10-22 00:54:43 👀
general 2021-10-22 00:55:26 i like rbk321
general 2021-10-22 00:55:35 they gave me my roles twice :3

plane-crazy 2021-10-22 06:39:36 last i checked - the reports are off
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 06:39:46 so - what happens? they get away with it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 06:41:40 thats preddy shiddy but alr

bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:41 i had no idea
bot-central 2021-10-23 02:52:47 i guess i gotta talk more 👀
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 02:53:55 that's dope.. but what's that middle one?
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 02:54:31 well, it's impressive :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 02:55:02 *Woah*
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 02:55:35 I like it :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 03:01:34 have another
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 03:01:47 *ahhhhhh yoink*
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:03:42 Surprisingly, It can
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:06:35 It has pretty good suspension that gives it enough traction to go straight or turn when i want it to
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:21:21 alright.. that's gonna be hard because of the motor lock placement
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:36:58 <@!867076951293820958> 
I got my motor lock to work surprisingly - it's weird because I'm using a new method of motor locking, usually I hide it inside - but now I'm using it as the surface (you cant tell tho 😉)

here's the old link too

creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:45:29 yup
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:50:00 the trailer has little stands too (idk what they're called.. probably 'stilts')
creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:53:54 I looked it up, they're called 'Landing Gear'

Kinda easy to remember because I'm a pilot xD
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:05:32 Phone
.. or use links
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:10:22 no seriously it is actually called that
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:13:46 Well, it wasn't a flex ... so thanks for the compliment?
The number 1 rule to knowing if someone is a pilot is that they'll tell you 😂 
And thanks :>
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:16:00 O.o
creations-chat 2021-10-23 04:25:19 is it because you don't think it's easy? or thinking of it seems somewhat intimidating and/or offputting?
general 2021-10-23 04:26:20 Why does plane crazy break roblox? 🤔

creations-chat 2021-10-23 09:41:53 Honestly, I noticed the glass as soon as i sent it, i thought i could do better - but i cannot use emoji's, it for some reason, doesn't work
creations-chat 2021-10-23 22:57:39 Did someone just make Striker Eureka from Pacific Rim and not caption it?
help 2021-10-23 22:59:16 So you know if the door is welded? So it cannot move? And what motor are you using? (and what is the settings of it?)
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:01:57 That's a shame <@729112434639503470>  - maybe caption your posts, I think it'll help people understand what they are seeing (also so people can search it up and see your build)
creations-chat 2021-10-23 23:03:58 Your 'posts' in general - pictures, videos, anything you post in <#384025409945337856>  - it just helps (you don't have to btw, it's advice.. a suggestion)

creations-chat 2021-10-24 01:47:59 Ilike what you did with the colour, it makes it look 2x better
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:34:45 Alrighty, I've fixed the truck - how does it look now?
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:37:18 ** **
Here's the Inspiration material - and what it used to look like before my feedback (also, ignore the lights and bars on the "real" model)
creations-chat 2021-10-24 07:57:12 the last time i posted it, it was really the 2nd image (with tad better colour) - this one has the colour perfected i believe, so possibly hof worthy :>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:08:01 sure .. but what should the text say? (this is 80% up to you, 10% Roblox text tag algorithm and 10% bias xD )
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:10:25 "RUNNER" and other things idk
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:14:07 Maybe put a whole shrine for it

like a pathway leading to it with some roman looking columns
*fire and explosions - idk*

no, you can't modify it (I believe), but you can repost it
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:26:19 :>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 08:49:59 \:D (I didn't expect you to listen to me ngl - but that's what I am here for, and that's what this channel is here for) 

but that looks much better :>
creations-chat 2021-10-24 09:04:31 - idiot? oh... :C
creations-chat 2021-10-24 09:06:46 - and you linked my message.. oh wait the cool down.. my bad
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:11:58 Well this is interesting, I cannot copy paste the message without tags.. idk what I did wrong - I'll see how to fix this too
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:13:22 Nope 😕
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:14:17 - I can type something else in.. and then change it and it works
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:14:55 uhh... i have no clue, and it's not working with some words
bug-reports 2021-10-24 09:16:32 this is confusing
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:30:58 Ahh yes - of perfect
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:32:08 *ignore my cafuffle at the start - i'm not a fast builder anymore.. im really rusty*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:32:53 not cool.. the text worked once and then tagged the 2nd time
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:32:58 how does that work
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:33:15 "RENAULT"
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:33:25 - a vehicle manufacturer
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:33:38 idk how it's a bad word- but it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:34:02 😔
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:34:26 *that F-117 has potential*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:34:38 yup
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:34:55 xD

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:35:32 I just want to ask - cuz I never know why .. why cannot i reaction to message?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:35:56 *I see an Aileron Motor*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:36:05 👀
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:36:20 Hmmmmm, I won't argue with that xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:36:41 It looks amazing
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:36:51 All of your Gen 3 fighters look amazing ✨
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:37:03 sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:37:17 attention to detail  much
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:37:44 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:38:03 it's not complex. but it's quite a bit .. a lot more than the average build
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:38:31 my Renault has so much at the front 🥲 - I'm surprised i fit more detail in with the small space I had
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:39:30 my best plane - that's hard..  - I really like my Qatar Airways 777-3DZ(ER) - but my F-105 looks pretty good.. I don't like many of my other builds tho.. they're out dated

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:49:23 Ejection seque-**nom**
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:49:41 - It looks cool regardless
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:50:06 same, but it makes it unique
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:50:18 it has it's pros too
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:50:33 I believe someone has
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:51:22 yes, someone has - it's not the best so you can be the first to submit a cool creation 👀
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:52:55 easy
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:54:01 motor lock a motor 2 that's toggled in a direction that allows the bottom 2 thingo's to be angled correctly - you can put those thingos on that - and if you want to, add another motor 2 to control it (it should be light enough to not summon the kraken)
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:54:41 
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:54:55 I wont like, it looks challenging
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:55:02 but i believe in your ability \<3
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:55:22 *you're using motor 2's aren't you with mouse tracking*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:56:02 use the motor 2's as servos, this will no longer have the aircraft flying level (control surfaces would work tho) - but there will be no more shaking
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:56:59 Noice - so is it still shaking?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:57:10 Me - when i first started out
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:57:36 Hmmmmm.... I think it's PIO but I could be wrong, do you have a video of it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:57:45 xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:58:00 how about a photo?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:58:27 idk how a photo would help ngl, but i could spot an issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:58:32 (since when did i become helpful here xD )

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:34:10 Motor lock the missile, no problem
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:36:47 uhh, you don't need much room personally but alr
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:37:52 only 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:38:35 yes, i just did math
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:43:19 7 blocks wide to make a motorlock missile - 3 high and however long you want
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:52:24 I sent my truck in <#384025409945337856> and it said it only accepts images - they are both images .. (but i put a spoiler on one, am i allowed to?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:53:35 because the 2nd image wasn't plane crazy, it was reference to the irl thingy
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:53:44 *my inspiration*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:53:59 oh... alrighty thanks xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:54:22 nah, ill put both in so people dont need to ask me
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:54:55 (which also means more upvotes, people who are confused dont upvote)
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:55:07 w.. warning? the Server Mod said it's ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:56:03 he didnt say i'm not allowed too, he helped me with my issue, suggesting what i should do
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:56:43 so
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:56:43 waittttt okokok
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:57:30 OH
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:57:43 sorry, the reference image I was looking for.. was removed
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:57:57 someone elses reference image in <#384025409945337856>  - i mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:58:41 yea i get it.. but i'd like to ask, would it be possible to send the reverence image with the same message as the post of my creation?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:59:22 okok
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:59:24 sure thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:59:43 xD, i should've believed you
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:59:56 i apologise for doubting you. you do know this server more than me

My inspiration (for those who don't know what it's meant to be) (from Euro Truck Simulator 2): 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/593979260830482452/901797463239827466/ets2_20211024_200302_00.png
creations-chat 2021-10-24 12:19:58 That could be the angle, or the fact that it's not possible to lower the visor without changing the roof because of the way I put together the motor lock

It is meant to be tall as it's the 'High' variant, but ok, I might change it then for ya :3 I'll see what I can do
creations-chat 2021-10-24 12:24:17 Here are old images - I'm using these because the height didn't change here

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:33:13 G'day mate
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:33:26 how is everyone?
general 2021-10-24 22:50:29 hof is now almost impossible
general 2021-10-24 22:50:37 i need to go bigger
general 2021-10-24 22:50:41 i need to get better
general 2021-10-24 22:50:58 I only have one build that can accomplish this feat
general 2021-10-24 22:51:40 everyone makes a superhornet tho - i want something that stands out
general 2021-10-24 22:51:42 yea
general 2021-10-24 22:51:52 i wont deny that it's amazing
general 2021-10-24 22:51:57 but.. its ... its boring?
general 2021-10-24 22:52:15 idk, it doesn stand out for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:57:38 Question
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:57:51 should i use a swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:57:59 or just.. prop motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:58:16 the prop motors will make the heli work at least
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:58:36 this swashplate is huge, but so is the heli, i'll be able to fit it i believe
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:59:37 *You are smart*
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:59:41 I really like that idea
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:59:42 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:59:47 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:06:01 *there's no way my swashplate will fit* - unless i make the heli bigger
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:06:06 which would be SICCC
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:10:43 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:10:55 is there any other options?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:11:18 not that what you have is bad, but maybe you could go "bigger" or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:12:14 same, my giant swashplate has nothing to go on -yet 😉
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:12:41 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/782076848070590524/trebuchet_3.jpg

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:13:18 Thanks :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:13:29 that would look AMAZING ✨
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:15:29 My swashplate is 7 blocks wide actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:15:35 theres no way it'll fit
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:03 wait.. what is ranks?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:11 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:13 those ranks

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:18:46 add more wedges 😂
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:18:56 (don't kill me plz, i joking)
general 2021-10-24 23:21:17 I've only seen one of these in a public server .. i remember looking at it and not knowing what the hell im looking at
general 2021-10-24 23:21:47 you had to do some motor lock or something? idk.. but it looked cool
general 2021-10-25 00:19:44 toxic much?
general 2021-10-25 00:20:06 what is happening here ._.
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:32:53 Guess the vehicle from this short video (Hint: ||Helicopter||)
😎
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:34:45 *close*
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:35:49 It's this :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:39:41 *how do i hide the motor lock on something so delicate* - i'm going to have to make this section twice as big
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:40:14 😎
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:40:19 I must use it
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 00:59:56 Everyone is at my plane like they've never seen one before
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 01:04:07 xD

plane-crazy 2021-10-25 01:14:37 *nice*
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 01:19:57 i know i was watching chat and all, but i have no clue what im looking at here except an AGM-65 missile
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:35:39 Apart from the absurd colour (my reference images were black and white from the 1940's) - what do you think of my USS CVL-22 Independence?
creations-chat 2021-10-25 10:58:09 feedbakk on this too?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:19:43 will you angle the cockpit and nose down?  like what you commonly see in the real life aircraft?
general 2021-10-27 09:23:14 not me 🙃
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:24:50 ooo nice .. i cant really see it if it is - i think i need the rest of the plane for comparison - but if you say it is - then the finished product will look amazing ✨
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:31:12 Sadly relatable, I love building extremely detailed builds, but the part count sky rockets and it's harder to PVP - One of my builds which I'm quite proud of has a "low" (about under 1000) part count for high detail - But it's pretty bad at PVP because i put looks over functionality and maneuverability
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:34:21 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-10-27 09:39:37 it's there he says
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:40:31 you have to admit that it's pretty cool xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:41:48 <@!698587744842022983> *need help*
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:42:48 so, the game doesn't like too many motor 2's other wise it wobbles or sometimes spazes or if you're unlucky.. kraken
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:43:30 you can get away with it with putting lighter 'objects' on the end of the motor 2's
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:43:52 so i believe in your case, the turrets are too long, making it heavier, and wobble more
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:44:50 well, you can trial and error to see what works, but yes, try that off first
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:48:06 well.. it's 'weight' - and i believe helium blocks doesnt work because the motor still required whatever amount of torque to move the now 'more' blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:48:13 - if that makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:49:03 I don't know why that one works, to be honest - but maybe you could test it out and see why xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:49:28 i'm sorry but my knowledge on motor 2's are limited
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:51:32 possibly - i am not sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:19:19 hello :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:19:32 *how is everyone today?*
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:23:13 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:28:17 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:30:17 is it hard to identify this aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:31:00 Hello :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:31:15 It's a B-52 xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:32:09 *ok*
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:33:13 you know.. instead of insulting my builds - you could possibly help me out by telling me what you recomend me fix
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:33:42 *lets see it*
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:34:35 I guess i'll be the judge of that
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:35:30 Ummm
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:35:35 alrighty then
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:36:40 no further comment - i gotta fix my B-52 to be better xD

plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:46:47 this is a slightly old pic - as i've fixed up the gear and doors
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:56:43 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:57:48 https://youtu.be/riEmAvlrynk?t=28
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 04:58:20 yum
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 05:05:42 ok, i made the gear SO MUCH more flush
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 05:05:59 because after sending that vid, i noticed how ugly those thingos that arent flush look
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 05:42:22 :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 09:23:53 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 09:24:18 I am aware this isn't creations feedback.. i'm just here to **flex** xD - not really, but i'm trying to get it to work without bugging.. which seems to be a constant problem here
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 09:25:32 no :>
creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:31:28 Thoughts on my somewhat buggy B-52?
creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:36:13 well, how i did it here was using a powered locked motor and a piston to get it to look flush (im not putting that effort into the bomb bay doors as it opens differently)
but theres a lot of motor lock involved to get the gear in (not the doors, but some for that too)

the motor lock was only to get the gears to be 45*'s off
creations-chat 2021-10-28 09:38:26 yes, they are :>
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:48:56 kinda a good idea tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:49:17 *i wonder when bobox will be up*

creations-chat 2021-10-29 14:32:31 Thoughts on the B-52 so far? (the tail will be longer, it's just what i can fit in the space so far - oh and ignore the top, it's a mess)
(It isn't a specific type, like B-52**D** or B-52**H**)
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:09:46 while Roblox is down, I can plan the aircraft so i can build it faster when time comes

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:14:21 You know how everyone makes F-18's and 747's
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:14:40 yes xD
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:14:41 - what if you can find a plane based on that - that is unique and special
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:15:03 No one has made a LCF Dreamlifter

creations-chat 2021-11-02 16:33:20 Ooooo TheMoYouKnow 
But I have a similar unbalanced issue with my rocket, I just have to add more wings to it
creations-chat 2021-11-02 22:42:28 yea.. when you take photos or snippets of something, try and hide your cursor, because its kinda .. idk but it gives me anxiety - i just wanted to see the cockpit windows, it looks a bit small, I cant see the tail, but it looks like it just ends instead of gets smaller? idk it could be the angle, other than that it looks really good
creations-chat 2021-11-02 22:44:43 nono, all good - sorry for mine really

OOOOooooo that looks really good :>
creations-chat 2021-11-02 22:46:57 \<3
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:04:35 seems really dumb of me to ask this
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:04:53 but how do you make a rocket fly straight with absolutely no tendency to pitch
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:06:40 xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:06:58 i just want to know if there's an easy solution really
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:07:23 i know fins at the bottom and the CoG
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:07:25 alrighty

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 01:12:43 Definitely Lada
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 01:17:44 is it possible for your camera to revolve around the CoG instead of the player, it helps when i put my seat in the very top, so i can see the bottom
creations-chat 2021-11-03 01:19:13 Lada
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 01:25:47 I found the issue of why my rocket doesnt like flying upright
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 01:26:08 the lada uses wing panels to make it look better, it's raising the CoP over the CoG
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:44:33 Ooooo
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:44:36 niceee
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:44:48 xD

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:04:29 i know xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:04:59 ohhhh okay
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:05:03 i thought they were signs
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:05:21 if they were signs, then looking at it, a motor locked wing panel should work
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:05:59 alrighty

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 06:33:08 wait.. i've never done that - does it actually mute them or just makes me unable to see their messages

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 06:35:42 helo
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 09:34:28 although it's really far off, its coming together :>
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 09:35:37 oh it's what the plane is meant to look like.. and what my result is - the wing is far off and the sweep is too
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 13:23:48 Mil Mi-35 >:3

creations-chat 2021-11-11 01:47:02 apart from the nose 🤦 

<@!456238251204935690>  and yes it can do a loop of any sort xD - it will just be slow at it
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:07:26 Sure, I will do that >:3 - what livery though?
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:22:44 Well, I didn't plan to just make the -H version, I planned to make an older version, you've told me the -C so i'll do it, i just need a livery
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:52:50 I'd like that.. but I have no space to put the X-15
creations-chat 2021-11-11 02:55:06 <@!527653676022628353> the nose is smoother :3

creations-chat 2021-11-11 06:20:42 I don't know what happened with the door here - but if you didn't tell me what is is, I still would've known - you've captured the irl build and presented it basically perfectly. - I like it a lot \:D

general 2021-11-13 11:07:43 i think it's an A-5 but idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:32:32 i feel like this would be the most popular wedge, a half triangle wedgeblock O.o

Anyone think something else would be more popular?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:34:10 the name?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:34:29 yea.. i couldn't think of a name so i said that
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:34:38 but yea, that would me helpful xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:36:30 this is a *inner wedge*
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:36:41 ~~texture so it's easier to see~~

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:38:15 yikes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:39:08 I've never gone through a stage of that, I've had some exposed motor lock where i couldn't hide it (and it's kinda obvious_ - but never to this extent
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:39:33 😉
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:39:48 - i think there are more efficient methods
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:40:16 I know a way to hide motor lock on things like the wingtip tilt of an F-4 Phantom
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:40:37 uhh sure xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:40:41 lemme find a build with similar
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:41:06 GL indeed :>
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:49:20 is this impressive? idk how my skill compares to everyone (this is not a propellor blade block)
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:49:44 no i mea.. ok thanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:49:59 <@!629858706997248000> invisible angled motor lock

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:50:49 hihihi you got it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:51:29 honestly, i thought i invented it - and then i joined this community and realised many others use it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:51:40 but it isnt "well known" as you think
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:52:02 xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:52:07 show?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:52:12 oh i do

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:55:11 but in agreement
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:55:17 it's ok anyways
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:59:13 My poor self who invented the same thing on paper also
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:59:26 But.. it was an overhead wing aircraft with a t tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 11:59:37 But the t tail also moved slightly

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:00:55 I can't unfold it in a public server - so I could get an old image .. or you'll have to wait a bit

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:08:24 yup xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:08:46 *but it does becomes annoying when they blacklist me and i can't unfold*
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:09:05 the airport doesnt work - so i have to spawn in the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:09:19 but it's annoying cuz you know.. a B-52 isnt water operational
creations-chat 2021-11-16 07:35:56 Looking at it - i need to turn the blocks into 1x1's to put much more detail in.. other than that.. thoughts?


I FIXED THE NOSE!!!
creations-chat 2021-11-16 07:48:44 so what exactly is wrong with the nose.. "it's flat" ?

The B-52G/H has a more pointy nose than it's predecessors, i tried to replicate it here - and here are some reference images of a B-52G/H and a B-52C/D
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495286269459300364/910075408802803752/aa483df4ca76b1f625eb2b3bdd7f5c1f.png

Interesting y'all say that

(I kept the aspect ratio the same - I promise)
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:06:13 that really is interesting - though they're taken at slightly different angles that it might give the illusion of that - anyways, I'll see if I make it flatter, see what it looks like
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:09:02 I uhhh.. don't see a way to make it flatter.. without making it look worse
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:11:15 Well, If i use a half wedge for the tip (very middle section) - then the parts next to it will not be able to be flush with the nose.. and even completely redesigning won't achieve the desired outcome 

it is the thing in your mirror <@!721103577380159490> 😉

general 2021-11-23 06:36:07 Hey guys I need help
general 2021-11-23 06:36:33 My best friend, who my ex replaced me with, is now thinking of persuing the girl I am persuing
general 2021-11-23 06:36:37 What do I do?
general 2021-11-23 06:37:49 But, the thing is, I have nothing against him, my ex liked him and left me.. that's not his fault
general 2021-11-23 06:38:08 And this girl, I haven't told her or anyone my situation with...
general 2021-11-23 06:38:13 So he doesn't know about me
general 2021-11-23 06:38:41 I'm serious tho.. idk what to do
general 2021-11-23 06:38:46 And killing is haram
general 2021-11-23 06:38:56 I am halal :)
general 2021-11-23 06:40:15 I'm not killing someone so I have a better chance
general 2021-11-23 06:40:35 The thing is.. I could talk to them . But then I'd expose myself
general 2021-11-23 06:42:17 I'm taking things slow and careful cuz I know her well
general 2021-11-23 06:42:21 He's diving in
general 2021-11-23 06:42:36 Not really.. but he's gonna make a move
general 2021-11-23 06:42:54 I already made mine and the outcome was amazing 😌
general 2021-11-23 06:43:00 But we ain't a thing
general 2021-11-23 06:45:00 GOOD IDEA
general 2021-11-23 06:45:08 I'll get my girl by being druck
general 2021-11-23 06:45:12 And if I fail
general 2021-11-23 06:45:16 I blame the alcohol
general 2021-11-23 06:47:19 :(
general 2021-11-23 06:47:39 Ouch
general 2021-11-23 06:47:42 50 50
general 2021-11-23 06:49:27 Fuck it.. I see no flaws in me
general 2021-11-23 06:49:34 I'm the papi chulo in this house
general 2021-11-23 06:49:39 She'll make the right choice
general 2021-11-23 06:49:45 I believe in her to do good
general 2021-11-23 06:50:07 Nono, it's ok
general 2021-11-23 06:50:10 I got a plan
general 2021-11-23 06:50:41 😏
general 2021-11-24 09:11:15 YOOOOOOOOOOOO
general 2021-11-24 09:11:16 BRO
general 2021-11-24 09:11:25 UBER DRIVERS HAVE TO **WALK TO WORK**
general 2021-11-24 09:11:47 that is some big brain stuff right there
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 07:18:30 looks like something i'd make in KSP
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:18:45 howwwwwwwwwwww
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:19:30 is that a challenge?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:20:00 I will now proceed to make the first supersonic airliner in Plane Crazy xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:21:26 
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:21:39 😬 im going to make it 2x2 because OCD
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:23:11 oh god...
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:23:23 I'll do my best
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:37:09 okay.. the nose will have a mechanism that's a bit larger than i'd hoped which the fuselage will then look weird, so i'll have to find a way to counter it
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:38:06 that's dark
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:45:26 My issue isnt the droop snoot
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:45:39 but the cockpit windows, and then the canards that have to fold behind but at an angle
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 12:45:52 I'll have to motor lock on levels I've never done before :/
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 13:11:14 I'll do a lot of research actually before i throw myself into this project xD
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 12:34:51 it coming along nicely
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:51:03 progress for today
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:52:17 This is taking so long to make though, but I need to have an interior, while having the canards motor locked in there - but i cant put the lock anywhere because the front is holding the nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:52:25 yes it is :>
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:53:08 I hope I could put it next to a Concorde B)
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:53:26 yUH
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:53:53 I made a nose for it that works, i gave it to a friend (let them copy it) and then deleted it..
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:54:07 the Tu-144 has a different mechanism as the visor doesn't lower
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:54:19 *however the canards*
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:54:42 i'm so done with this nose... i just need to finish the visor and then literally he rest is so easy
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:54:53 but for now.. im going to sleep
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 16:55:06 goodnight

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:58:57 mechanical?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:59:14 well.. it's just the angle
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 04:00:16 well.. i kinda need an explanation cuz i don't get it
creations-chat 2021-12-02 04:12:27 shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:49:48 yes, the nose droops
creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:52:04 <@!347918144062488586> droop snoot
creations-chat 2021-12-08 03:00:07 basically. it's different

plane-crazy 2021-12-08 03:05:06 
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 03:05:50 I'll get to that now
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 03:06:50 sad CCCP-77111 noises
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:00:31 thoughts? opinions?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:04:57 but......... no?
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:09:57 swept back by 5 degrees i think
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:19:19 first of all the foul language is unnecessary, and it isn't too thin, maybe the blue stripe makes it look thinner but it isn't too thin 

but interesting you say the tail is too long... i messed up the motor lock there though that makes it look too thin, thanks for that, i'll fix that up
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:26:00 did you just compare a Tupolev Tu-144(with no designation) with my Tupolev Tu-144D

that blueprint is incorrect to my build, It's like classifying german shepards with huskies

The tu-144D has a different wing, different engines, it has different gear placement and the original doesnt even have canards
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:29:41 basically, the fuselage isn't too thin
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:32:32 that's the thing, there isn't any decent ones
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:35:09 sheesh you're toxic... it's because you're comparing a plane that's basically totally different to mine and saying im incorrect
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:38:44 there's actually quite a few Tu-144's, the prototype was built without canards, when the soviets made their first "actual" tu-144, the Tu-144S, they fixed everything that went wrong with the first, including changing the size of the aircraft, with bigger wings and a longer body
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:42:28 Sadly, no red

and no, those arent flaps <@!754217246729175090>, the Tu-144 doesn't have flaps, what you're seeing in that image is just the control column pushed forward to make the control surfaces go down (also because gravity helps do that)

<@!719168864705052802> I think I'm not stupid as i literally can tell you every individual difference of the Tu-144 and Tu-144D - starting with the **dimensions** - please do your research before you tell me off \:)
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:46:52 I can tell you what isn't accurate with my build is the door placement due to the canards needing more space because plane crazy wont let them deploy 😔
(that's a bad image to show the doors and canards.. but here :> )
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:52:02 yes, because he doesn't know any better 🤷 


and yea, that's why I'm not trying to trigger him by being toxic back, I don't want this community to become a warzone more than it already can be

Anyways, I'll just ignore him if he gets any worse :>
creations-chat 2021-12-09 13:01:23 Yep :3
creations-chat 2021-12-09 13:05:32 I mean yea, but I wouldn't insult him for not knowing - i'll admit i could've been more informative with the context - but regardless, he threw punches before i corrected him
creations-chat 2021-12-10 01:00:50 Thank you :>
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:07:53 helo
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:07:56 what happened?
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:08:07 i got kicked
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:08:13 and i cant join
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:08:29 oof
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:10:59 yea btd, idk why i can't join \:(
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 12:35:45 
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 12:35:47 xD
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 12:38:23 
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:13:19 this took my whole CPU and GPU to make
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:14:23 🤣
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:14:26 so accurate
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:14:52 thanks xD
creations-chat 2021-12-12 13:18:09 Thoughts? idk where to go with this but yea xD
creations-chat 2021-12-12 13:27:54 😎
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:35:31 did somebody say B52?
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:35:36 😏
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:36:23 Does anyone have Tu-95?
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:36:30 👀
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:37:39 If that's an F-35 I think the wings looks a bit long - if you don't think so, then maybe the engine intakes are a bit slim
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:37:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/656808880646389770/910189286484217887/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:37:53 Buff :>
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:38:25 O.o
creations-chat 2021-12-20 05:54:31 understandable :>
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:02:23 Are you familiar with *\*dramatic pause\** **motor lock**

No but there's always a crazy amount of detail one could put in when they learn motor lock xD
If you don't want to, the only thing i can say is the intakes but other than that, it's pretty good \:D
creations-chat 2021-12-20 06:07:44 Motor lock was a big learning curve for me, I don't want to call myself good at it, but I think I've got the hang of it to extents that surprise even myself xD

If you ever need help, the community (and me) is here to help :>
general 2021-12-27 10:13:31 This server is more surprising to me than i thought
general 2021-12-27 10:13:41 there are so many players and so many things to build
general 2021-12-27 10:14:00 however i've not seen anyone make the JWST
creations-chat 2021-12-29 10:37:59 <@456226577798135808>, I like the 777, however it's hard to see everything with the small images, could you make it larger for me (and others) too see it

plane-crazy 2021-12-31 10:59:28 👀
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 10:59:55 I have creation blacklist 😔
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:00:22 I didn't know sending a 747 in the snow was illegal, i just wanted to know if I could make one, if it would count
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:01:05 ooof, i meant that
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:01:08 sorry xD
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:01:46 but yea, i did read the description of the channel, it just didnt explain that
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:02:12 I don't know... no one said anything
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:02:30 I sent an image wondering if it would count to make it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:02:46 read what?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:02:51 747 in the snow
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:03:13 "snow vehicle"
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:03:40 Cuz the last thing i want to do, is make a submission for the contest and have it disqualified because it doesnt fit the theme
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:04:37 xD thanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:04:58 but yea.. i learnt it wouldn't work .. but i'm blacklisted :/
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:06:24 I thought it was obvious that sending a 747 is not a submission, so the staff would be fine about it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:06:40 *and it somewhat fit the theme*
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 11:07:09 rip
the-dump 2021-12-31 15:10:43 kinda sus
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:15:41 What is better? Functionality or looks?

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 04:59:14 I just got a B-52 and I was thinking, it would be cool to hook it up to one
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 04:59:33 
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 05:00:03 xD well.. I think i need a bit more than mini
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 05:04:51 would it fit?
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 05:06:08 😬
creations-chat 2022-01-06 05:32:28 So, I'm thinking of adding weathering to the aircraft, but is there any suggestions on things I could fix or possibly add to make it better (it's a Boeing B-52H, and I'm not putting the X-15 on it)
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 06:43:05 I want a crazy/mad scientist rank but all I got is the Soviet Proton M Rocket.. which isn't fast enough and cannot land its 2nd and 3rd stage
Do I make another rocket or do I upgrade the Proton
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 06:44:49 got it

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 15:49:26 <@!261894597590908940> honestly, getting the nose to droop was easy- getting it to look good, clean wasn't that easy

plane-crazy 2022-02-18 03:16:58 i havent looked into it that much either
creations-chat 2022-02-18 03:26:53 I was doing research into rounding the nose a bit more, now the forehead looks good, but making the nose less long seems to degrade the appearance it has - Look, in my opinion it looks good, but i don't know how to improve it more to the standard you're suggesting


I will keep trying, I'll see if adding more to the bottom will make it look more round and better
creations-chat 2022-02-18 04:47:54 <@456226577798135808> how does this look

plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:10:06 yep, most likely 2 in one
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:10:29 im pretty sure it's 2 in one, the 2 people joined at the same time and took the last plot left
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:10:43 they share a build 👀
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:11:09 lmaooo thats a smart way to put it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:11:25 but as i said - "im pretty sure" - does not mean im correct
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:11:54 we could test it ourselves 🤷
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:13:24 logs?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 11:16:38 do logs, like logs that have been cut and layed or even just fallen dead trees

and is this good enough that should I submit it?
creations-chat 2022-03-09 11:44:44 how? may you give me more detail on what the issue is with my landing gear?
creations-chat 2022-03-09 11:49:39 Unfortunately, i cannot fit anything larger in the main gear area, so im stuck with this - also, the rod is split up into 2 if this is what you mean (image for reference)


<@!682147422218223616> great idea 👀
creations-chat 2022-03-09 11:55:06 you're talking about the front strut of the nose gear? (the one that's about 45*s)?
creations-chat 2022-03-09 12:02:55 yes, and the engines are angled up a little bit too :>

<@!877391100137070625> i think i understand, I'll adjust it when i can :>
creations-chat 2022-03-09 13:40:07 honestly, i've been criticised on my builds for things that are accurate or don't exist on the build - but i jsut have to ignore it
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 08:05:31 so, everyone makes massive planes.. and i'm just planning it out now but... do i have to angle lock this?? .. can i just not?

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:48:41 he proceeds to show me a tutorial build and denies that it is one

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:51:03 truee
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:51:13 but was the 10 minute F-15 good 🤔
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:51:50 xD
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:52:51 here's the kids build, he called it a black hole and i actually looked for it in creations to see if i could find him - cuz i thought it was pretty cool, i saw one in there that was red and asked him if he had a red one... he said no and i realised i've been duped
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:54:12 i agree, but when it spawns it kinda looks like a black hole
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:54:24 yes, i agree it looks like a mess
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 00:54:42 true, im sure i can get my dog to build it

contest-chat 2022-03-22 10:28:32 it was not

plane-crazy 2022-04-20 07:35:55 hai \:D
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 07:46:52 that's pretty good in my opinion, the reference has some bars that are a bit thinner, although it might be hard in plane crazy, it would be cool if you could get it a tad bit thinner :3 - but other than that, i think this is superb
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 08:37:23 If I want someone to make a 787 for me, do i just publically ask here or smth? Idk, I just want to make the Boeing Lineup and I'd like people to help out :>
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:01:29 I'm making a 747, what airlines should I put on it?
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:02:48 so far i'm thinking Qantas, for the -238 and -438ER, Pan Am for the -132
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:03:02 *I don't know what else to add*
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:09:08 Batik doesn't have a 747, that tail pattern will be hard but I can surely try
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:10:32 *LionAir doesn't have 747 either*
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:10:43 oh my
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:11:02 had... right?
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 05:11:25 Yoooo I'm trippin, i thought they never had any.. ok that's cool

plane-crazy 2022-04-21 11:01:16 sure, I'm adding one on the -238 and -438ER
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 11:01:36 so a retro, and then the recent livery

general 2022-04-24 09:33:50 O.o
general 2022-04-24 09:34:54 ~~That's a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, you can tell by the window size~~

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 10:42:07 \:D
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 10:42:49 BUFF 👀
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 10:43:25 the halal version of 'BUFF' tho, cuz he a frenly boi -w-
creations-chat 2022-04-24 10:51:33 <@510501949691658240> the Sukhoi Su-33, it has sm0l intakes, a very basic wing and wingbox that can be smoothed out a bit (the gear should fold forward but I wont judge if you cant get that to work cuz it looks amazing anyways)
creations-chat 2022-04-24 11:00:04 the motor locked wings wont let it fit without being ugly 😪
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:19:54 hehe ... balls
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:20:54 as an australian, i'm proud
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:21:41 xD
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:22:18 that An-124-102 would just look like a giant* An-70
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:23:38 higher (larger) cargo, which can help greatly with capacity
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:24:01 i.... do you live in NSW
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:24:32 i'm an australian, NSW is the place that has that
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:24:54 ~~stock image moment~~
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:25:31 *crikey*
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:26:52 relatable.. but with other aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:27:39 how did the nose gear go?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:28:08 nose gear
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:28:15 the wheel at the front of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:29:09 hehehe i expected that
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:29:17 (cuz i would personally struggle with it)
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:30:15 :3
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:43:30 I want to make a Boeing 747 (any type), I want Airline suggestions for it :>
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:43:57 that's okay :>
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:44:42 Just name me an airline that flies the 747 of any type, and i'll prolly make it
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:45:02 looking into this, I'm thinking of making the VC-25B (the new one that isnt out yet)
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:46:20 I'm thinking of that too, however I have no clue how I'll be able to pull it off (that wont stop me from trying)
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:46:38 now tell me.. how do i make that in place crazy?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:47:05 (I have looked into the pokemon one tbh, and a qantas aboriginal art one)
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:47:43 *whoops*
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:49:11 btw, should i make the 747 with an interior, or one that has 100% realism on the outside, but no interior
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:50:14 windows are too small on the irl aircraft, plane crazy windows will look kinda bad - also, it'll be hard to add the airline name on the side
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:50:26 how will i perform that?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 12:52:02 rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 13:56:02 hey, change the motors and that to a darker shade to hide them better with the rest of the build (just do some trial and error to get it)
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 13:58:45 yes, but not limited to just that :>
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 13:59:03 poop deck
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 13:59:23 :>

creations-chat 2022-04-25 00:11:00 I keep getting that feedback, i have no idea how to improve it, y'all keep comparing it to a kidney stone and i honestly don't see it, i have no clue what to do
creations-chat 2022-04-25 00:13:44 how could i improve the nose? or how would YOU improve it if you could?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:57:45 helo guys
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:57:49 oh my
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:57:57 that's a lot of progress since i last saw it
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:59:05 well, firstly, i dont know what you're making
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:59:12 but it needs more wedges
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:59:25 sheeeeesh
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:59:37 you're gonna need a bigger boa.. balloon.. balloon
general 2022-04-26 05:29:12 what do you like?
general 2022-04-26 05:29:30 damn
general 2022-04-26 05:29:37 need help with planes then?
general 2022-04-26 05:30:05 well, what issues do you have with the planes?
general 2022-04-26 05:30:30 the thing with planes is lift and thrust
general 2022-04-26 05:30:37 uhhhhh
general 2022-04-26 05:31:30 I personally start with the wheels because i want it to be the most realistic thing, and then work on the skeleton of it (like to see how to make the nose and where the wings would be) and then start from the front and work my way back
general 2022-04-26 05:31:43 but that's me.. im built different
general 2022-04-26 05:32:00 i dont recommend what i do if you're new... only if you want something really realistic
general 2022-04-26 05:34:00 oh yes.. fighter jets... 😅 i make commercial aircraft
general 2022-04-26 05:35:13 short answer the 747 is coming along really slowly
general 2022-04-26 05:35:45 long answer, the rudder doesnt work how i want it to, to make it easier for me in the future.. so idk and the wings are being annoying, because i have to redo them to fit (make them a bit bigger) so right now, they're undone and ughhhh
general 2022-04-26 05:36:47 that's the thing.. for it to work, i must angle lock it
general 2022-04-26 05:37:04 however when i'll add airline decals onto it, it wont look good as it wont be straight anymore
general 2022-04-26 05:40:15 xD
general 2022-04-26 05:40:41 i've experimented with cam lock, im not very good at it yet so im not sure how to do it
general 2022-04-26 05:42:53 he do be typing an .. oop
general 2022-04-26 05:45:03 I was working on an Ace Combat inspired aircraft yesterday and I tried cam locking because i was rushing and forgot something
general 2022-04-26 05:45:49 i connected it to something that would lock under the main wing - and then angle the rudders inwards (so it would appear to attach on the wing) -but the entire wing was angled
general 2022-04-26 05:46:08 like, i'd spawn it and everything angled itself
help 2022-04-26 05:50:45 Disconnectors
help 2022-04-26 05:51:46 or springs too, i personally love disconnectors because they can be used in non pvp and not leave a bunch of crap everywhere (i know there's ways too don't worry) but i personally think it's much easier
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:04:06 nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:04:21 how will you add the motor lock? to get those specific angles?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:05:19 looking a bit sus there
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:05:25 xD

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:27:52 what is tiny?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:28:33 oki :>
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:29:19 randomly, i've been making detailed builds and due to my effort in details, they're always huge for some "unknown" reason
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:29:49 wedges >:3
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:29:53 all of them
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:30:05 <:RoundMotor:706287054023294997>
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:32:01 well, if you're referencing something off of minecraft, it'll be expected to look good in minecraft, or to look like something from minecraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:32:27 you can do that if you'd like also - but just try things out, experiment
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 07:33:07 i dont remember the name of all the pieces so i cant just tell you what to do, or how to do things - but just play around, trial and error until you get somethign that fits
general 2022-04-26 07:34:06 look, im not the best with geography and buildings - but ... malaysia? like are those the petrona towers or something?
general 2022-04-26 07:34:20 SHEEEESSSHHH
general 2022-04-26 07:34:28 lucky guess
general 2022-04-26 07:34:42 i didnt even scroll own to see what y'all are saying either

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:21:07 oki
help 2022-04-26 08:22:27 I have the same issue, i'm blaming the bot
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:22:51 i take it back
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:22:54 i tried
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:22:58 i failed... miserably
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:23:07 i couldn't cope 😔
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:26 hover engines actually have more lag than other engine forms - obviously in higher numbers
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:36 or some pvp planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:32:01 true, but some people have it just cuz they can
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:32:06 to escape shredders or smth
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:32:15 i've seen 2 examples :3
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:33:40 well, i personally have conveyors on half my builds cuz i can
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:07 i'm planning to make a conveyor train btw (trust me, i'm an engineer)
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:37 half my builds are over 1000 blocks, so i use them if i get some lag slow motion thingo
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:59 conveyor engine, i've done experimenting on this and there's a really small line to perfection
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:35:21 tbh i think i hold the record for the fastest train lap cuz i havent seen much action on this
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:35:38 I'm making the reseau? the .. baguette train
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:35:42 french one
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:36:22 do you not want it too?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:36:53 ohhhhh like pitch upwards yes, this is because of the wings being too far forward
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:37:09 you need more weight at the front to make it not pitch upwards
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:38:14 just use a ballast block, set it to whatever works honestly
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:38:35 im staying put cuz im lazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:38:42 goodnight

plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:03:52 I only hope that plane Crazy 2 can fix this issue, this is just too much to change just for it to work
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:24:48 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:25:38 but then there's idiots who are perfectionists and tell you to do things pretty impossible too
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:26:36 i've got told to do things that i can't do, and i ask them to do it or help me -but they do nothing about it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:27:08 no time, yet has enough to tell me to do everything that i can't
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:27:53 now i'm not saying im the best at the game, but i know a lot of stuff, and i have limits to building things - so idk what i can do
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:28:06 and they don't tell me how i can achieve what they say
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:29:06 well typically i'd say no
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:29:20 i know smiley is a pro builder tho, literall <#627195143040139264> worthy

creations-chat 2022-05-10 03:43:09 I've found a way around this rule without getting myself slaughtered by the mods >:3

plane-crazy 2022-05-10 05:20:30 I'm looking into making the longest functional (realistic) train in plane crazy right now
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 05:20:51 is there a record for longest functional trains?

can it take those corners without derailing? 👀
creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:46:45 well honestly, so you can get some record for longest train
creations-chat 2022-05-11 11:50:17 i see, I have a 4 carriage one (long carriages) that can barely fit at that loop
creations-chat 2022-05-12 06:09:13 <@784215959488430121> i love it, is there a better quality image that i could 'use'? 👀
creations-chat 2022-05-13 03:04:29 no it's alright nvm
creations-chat 2022-05-13 09:05:22 use helium up top and/or ballasts at the bottom, due to the small size of this it might be hard but it will work

creations-chat 2022-05-18 13:07:52 man y'all are snitches - you just want to see chaos and justice instead of helping eachother out to not get punished - just tell them to delete it instead of capturing them in 4K and butchering them



also wtf is this?

creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:38:52 can y'all just be nice to each other and give each other better feedback instead of insulting things that don't need to be insulted and just stop causing more chaos in general? - seriously, there's more ways to help each other out than being rude or mean
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:41:56 no i can agree, i've noticed how peoples standards are to have almost everything perfect and in proportion

people have different skill levels and not everyone can appreciate that
creations-chat 2022-05-23 01:46:26 I really think there needs to be a change in this server to make it more inclusive and inviting and much less toxic - but eh, i can't do anything.. just eat popcorn and watch the community having fun having a go at one another

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:33:51 oo what aircraft is that? I'm thinking IL-2 but i'm not sure
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:36:07 oooo nice, i like it :>
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:40:38 oh well, i can't judge the paint yet because i'm not 100% sure what I'll be looking at
(I hope i'm looking at the correct variant when i say this) but the only thing i think is the scoop on the bottom might be a bit too pronounced, if it's possible, move it in a bit to make it more flight  
-  Other than that, (and the long prop) i think it looks perfect

bug-reports 2022-07-08 15:43:02 My issue isn't textures?
bug-reports 2022-07-08 15:43:15 What does texture have to do with colour?

plane-crazy 2022-07-15 06:23:16 this looks really good, but tbh, despite the clear window indications, i would've guessed it was a 757
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 06:24:05 If it is possible to add more clip to the windows to give it that airbus look, that would be amazing
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 06:26:23 🤔
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 07:03:02 yea i like the top, it shows a bit more colour, and it focuses the room a bit better too

plane-crazy 2022-07-16 02:10:00 so what do you want it to say?
plane-crazy 2022-07-16 02:10:07 I thought you wanted just one letter
plane-crazy 2022-07-16 02:10:51 got it
plane-crazy 2022-07-16 02:11:45 well this uses a different technique so i can keep my one letter untagging thingo a secret
plane-crazy 2022-07-16 02:11:59 but here - just spam things at the end and pick the size for it to work lol

creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:05:26 yes, the spoilers, 3 part slotted Fowler flaps and Kruger slats all work
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:37:55 do you think i should trade off functionality for looks and make the windows text blocks instead?
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:40:46 Noted :> - I think I'll make both, but I need one good airline for it, I need idea's on which that would be though

plane-crazy 2022-07-25 00:43:46 *cough* Not a flex
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 00:44:30 If I wanted to flex, I'd show the 747 😄  But this is what I have that's a video of deploying gear

plane-crazy 2022-07-25 01:15:33 that is the Soviet Concorde, the Tupolev Tu-144D
creations-chat 2022-07-25 05:10:57 <@691825046590718111> How familiar are you with custom angle motor lock? - because I think this will be the next steps with your builds  -  My feedback on the A321 is to work a bit more on the gear (because It looks like the main gear won't be completely flush, maybe you could make it better). I'd love it if you could get the nose to retract forwards than backwards but that would most likely require custom angles
creations-chat 2022-07-25 06:23:01 Yes it's Ro-Scale, how could you tell?
creations-chat 2022-07-25 06:31:30 They're Japanese (presumably) so they're small

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 04:58:46 G'day everyone
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:18:53 it looks so amazing so far, I like how you're going with the -200B though, I haven't seen many of those - I have not much feedback except maybe the hump could look a bit smoother, however it's still amazing

Anyways, I'm showing you mine that I just finished (kind of) but I really like what you got so far
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:20:57 Is my Boeing 747 "average"?

😔 
How may I make it more than average then?
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:23:23 may i see the cockpit windows better? I think I should change mine actually
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:26:17 <@401530469952389130>  Sure, I'll redo the engines - The Livery will come soon don't worry about that >:) and how do/would I add more detail in general? - what should I add or change?

<@633408435601276945> that looks amazing!, the rear window looks a bit squished but other than that that's superb
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:40:25 <@401530469952389130> I'm just saying - without intent to put down others but to convey my message I kinda have too - I personally would not have called my 747 "average" or "mid", it's certainly better than other peoples airliners - but I agree that it isn't the best, just certainly better

And I'm not going to add window frames because the outline of the doors will be masked a little bit by the windows (I've already tried and experimented and I don't like it)

<@633408435601276945> no problem mate, good luck
creations-chat 2022-07-27 06:01:11 ahhh i see, you've succeeded at fucking with me, i was indeed very fucked
creations-chat 2022-07-27 08:01:56 are you saying the fuselage is vertically challenged? - because.. it isn't? it might be the angle.. I can take another later

creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:12:15 good song :>
creations-chat 2022-09-08 07:00:24 Make the rudder bigger - the rear most cockpit windows don't tilt that much down so if you could find a substitute or just remove it entirely, then yues
The gear looks kinda big tbh but idk how to fix that though - and I know it's a -200 but the engines look a bit small, idk how, but it would look much better if they could be a tad bit bigger - do some research into the Rolls Royce Trent 800's or Pratt And Whitney PW4000's
creations-chat 2022-09-08 07:33:21 :> I like to actually help others instead of watching them and the chaos that sometimes can ensure

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 05:59:20 well, why not make a float plane 👀 like a CL-415 or maybe something older like a Mallard
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 06:12:31 i agree but for some (albeit not many) circumstances it is allowable

creations-chat 2022-09-28 10:05:05 oh wow interesting
creations-chat 2022-09-28 10:07:09 I've seen 3 today excluding my attempt at one - anyways I don't have an answer to your thingo, but just trial and error to see what works, usually if you want an interior, it helps for more space so a half works, but doesnt look good - so you do what you think will work or just motor lock something completely different to see if that works instead - i always do trial and error, it helps to get the best outcome of what i want
creations-chat 2022-09-29 15:51:00 Name the plane 🤔 - and feedback?  (and just note, the retraction sequence is built with wobble, i could fix it but i dont want to, i really just care about it retracted and deployed)
creations-chat 2022-09-29 15:56:40 <@873156568659681290> not a 747
<@362779578282016790> It is very wobbly, but so much less wobbly than previously where it's just kraken and nothing works - it is all motor 2's and im trying to see if i can find a way to get it to work without changing motors, adding pistons, increasing space (this needs to be hella compact) - i got another trick in the book - but the goal here is to reduce keybinds for automation because this is 2 out of 5 gear, and the nose gear needs all sorts of keybinds itself

It's a C-5 Galaxy :>

<@456226577798135808> I'm not sure why some files I send have been doing that - it's been happening a lot recently and I'm not sure how to solve it
creations-chat 2022-09-30 09:53:34 kinda small Rolls Royce Trent 772-60B/C engines - but kinda hard to make bigger without redesign
creations-chat 2022-09-30 09:58:09 well it will depend on the airline you choose to pick, most pick rolls royce, it's also one of the trickiest to make - qantas for example though uses GE

creations-chat 2022-10-05 07:55:35 Thoughts? 🤔
creations-chat 2022-10-05 08:00:09 sure, I'll delete :3 - no i have no motivation to fix it up, it's an old build i made for the contest and didnt want to submit cuz I wasn't even comparable - despite my ability to custom angle motor lock, I'm pretty bad at it, especially with the tight parameters i got of having it all functional
creations-chat 2022-10-14 06:02:26 not only this actually but it can also be subjected to skill level - cuz when i started, my early builds i thought were amazing, not hall of fame worthy but i was proud - and now after years where i've gotten a bit better, those builds aren't as good as they seem - this could be subjected to other peoples builds as well (as critical as this may sound) - being better at the game makes other peoples builds a little less .. good
creations-chat 2022-10-14 06:32:04 he didn't tell what to fix - he mocked the random plane for it's looks instead of being constructive or even yet helpful

<@734433762523217991> the wings are very thin, try making them a bit larger

plane-crazy 2022-11-10 12:57:33 lmaoo alright
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 12:57:55 I loaded a bunch of builds to see if pistons broke - but they were all fine

contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:29:13 in plane crazy? 🤔
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:29:42 i only got one design that works and works reliably - everything else doesnt work at all - or reliably
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:30:49 I actually had a tunable ornithopter, so i could give it the perfect lift to drag ratio - but it didnt work well when hovering so i made one that hovers and goes forwards by toggling a motor 2
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:31:05 the ornithopter im working on right now - has no space for any of that
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:34:42 plzworkplzworkplzworkplzwork
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:35:08 I hope you can see it without any issues regarding my PC not being able to send non-corrupt files
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:36:54 steal the design if you'd like
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:37:04 anyone can just take this if they want to
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:37:57 it's compact, reliable - and i definitely didn't steal it off of someone else 👀  - no i didn't but it is based off of someones i saw, just much more compact
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:43:53 I feel bad for those who don't want me to expose this so they can win the competition <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:46:11 (red motor is the powered motor), the rest are unpowered - except the 3 at the back which are locked
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 13:48:39 i hope your dreams come true ✨
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 13:48:58 oh damn, plane crazy is out
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 13:49:09 daymn that's wild, you were just dreaming about that
contest-chat 2022-11-10 13:50:42 very unique design there, i like it - i have no clue if it would work or how effective it would be - but that's the trick with trial and error
contest-chat 2022-11-11 03:34:42 yes it is able to hover, i put 3 settings on it, hover, forward and downward - downward so it stays on the spot when i land it instead of going up or moving around
contest-chat 2022-11-11 03:35:29 the ornithopter im currently working on though cannot have this mechanism because it's too small to hold the mechanism
contest-chat 2022-11-11 10:51:35 on the off-chance (which is becoming more likely) that my ornithopter doesnt produce thrust itself, could I use rockets as a form of control surfaces and also propulsion to keep it airborne? 😅
contest-chat 2022-11-11 11:05:54 man i thought i leaked what i was building for a second
contest-chat 2022-11-11 11:06:52 you just happened to see a build i made about a year ago (that i changed for that short video) - and mentioned the thing i am currently working on 👀
contest-chat 2022-11-11 11:07:52 👀
contest-chat 2022-11-12 02:23:59 I was planning that, but making an ornithoper more impressive imo
contest-chat 2022-11-12 02:25:41 idk man

help 2022-11-12 07:35:38 there's 3 ways to do this, you could use a single motor that moves half your ship behind the other half to make it longer, motor locking an entire section of ship behind the front - or a mix of both
help 2022-11-12 07:37:02 an example of using a single motor is like this, where one half of the boat will move behind the second half
help 2022-11-12 07:37:17 (the motor is connected by hidden blocks but we dont talk about that)
help 2022-11-12 07:38:45 this is the motor lock way - where in my case, the whole front will be locked onto the rest of the aircraft
help 2022-11-12 07:39:35 I do have the third way (both motorlock and unfolding motor) but I can't show it as its existence is a secret 🤭

creations-chat 2022-11-12 08:31:50 maybe because the user was afk or you killed them on spawn
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:32:25 oh trust me i just finished the first door - and im either having it look good and be functional, or look realistic and not work at all
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:33:04 it looks amazing tho 🙃
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:34:51 the trick though is to put motor lock everywhere but the door and have the minimal amount on the door to make it look good - basically the build is built around the door and its functionality for me
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:36:17 oh yeah balance went out the window instantly
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:36:45 > -Can NOT use helium or hover thrusters
you can't add helium if you plan to enter it into the contest
contest-chat 2022-11-12 08:38:49 eh, i'll keep working on this, I htink I got an idea on how to get it to work worst case scenario
contest-chat 2022-11-12 10:12:01 yes, very gud :>
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:02:52 more bombs because yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:03:13 not based on irl F-16 loadouts, but just in general, more bombs is a yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:03:23 motor lock it somewhere in there 🤔
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:05:52 nahh honestly your F-16 loadout is nice
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:06:02 those 120's tho 👀
contest-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:42 idk i feel like that is easy
contest-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:33 one motor 2 for yaw, and one motor for the blades itself - i dont know if ailerons or pitch also moves the rotors or not though
contest-chat 2022-11-13 01:14:16 sorry, i meant one to make it spin
contest-chat 2022-11-13 01:14:34 well how about a tilt-rotor design
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:28:58 you wish to STEAL my design??? 🤔
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:29:33 it looks crap ngl - so i wont show it just yet until i get more progress
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:29:48 but i got to rebuild the front because the doors and windows looks terrible
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:30:47 oh all the wings are on, but they dont use the flapping mechanism i made previously
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:31:08 they are meant to wobble with the kracken but this isnt generating enough for thrust
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:31:20 very compact for the interior >:D
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:32:50 im the other way around 😅 I want it to look good
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:33:09 however this isnt working for me as the doors work, but doesnt look good enough
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:39:13 so far i've made EVERYTHING functional on it just like the movies :>
contest-chat 2022-11-13 09:49:38 I'll be straight my wings do not flutter like an ornithopter, but they do go up down, change pitch and even fold backwards
I have got working front doors, landing gear legs, rear door which also works as landing gear leg platform and even an interior set up (but it looks crap right now) - the functional parts do not look as good as it could be if it doesn't work, but I'd rather have it all work than to be a perfect looking stationary model
contest-chat 2022-11-13 10:03:54 am i not allowed to submit a video or gif?
contest-chat 2022-11-13 10:07:07 I don't remember the voting system, I haven't been watching contests enough
contest-chat 2022-11-17 05:04:46 Yo staff, are videos/gifs allowed to be submitted? and what are the checks for validity of the build?
contest-chat 2022-11-17 11:29:32 wouldnt that mean technically i could submit 4 builds with the excuse 2 of them are my brothers?
contest-chat 2022-11-18 01:19:20 well if i send an image - how would you know that it doesn't have helium, and that it flies?

contest-chat 2022-11-24 13:26:26 i honestly expect that myself 😬
contest-chat 2022-11-24 13:36:11 I'm pretty happy with it myself :>
contest-chat 2022-11-24 15:19:49 it "works" as in it unfolds - it flaps really badly so i need to work on it some more

contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:11 WAIT I DONT NEED TO MAKE IT WORK
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:14 OHHHHH YEAAHHHHHHHH
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:24 I'm rebuilding it again
contest-chat 2022-11-27 09:55:47 FARRRRRKKKK it took me forever to get it to flap reliably
contest-chat 2022-11-27 12:57:05 yes, i found a way to compact it by removing one side of the mechanism but linking it with the other so it still works in unison - i put it on my ornithopter WHICH I have already removed for a more reliable and compact mechanism
contest-chat 2022-11-27 12:59:44 it works - this is what i've got (it's not smooth because it's hitting the ground) but im still working on it of course
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:04:46 and yeah, i traded some of the space for a mechanism to allow the wings to be directly offset when flapping
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:17:24 but i sent this before.. all i've done was rework an entire flapping mechanism twice
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:20:22 not anymore
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:20:30 i was just told they dont need to produce lift
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:21:16 they do help in controlling the aircraft, including roll and yaw
contest-chat 2022-11-27 13:21:29 technically pitch if i retract them in flight

contest-chat 2022-11-30 18:22:13 Yeah I didn't, any attempt to make it smaller rendered the flapping useless
contest-chat 2022-12-01 06:15:32 <@866848584888877077> Are reference images allowed? So people know that I'm not as bad a building as I may seem 👀

contest-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:18 Rotary aircraft .... not aircraft with rotors
contest-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:58 I don't think a Dash 8 Q400 counts as a VTOL either
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:42:39 man i was proud of this 777 but it's so small compared to that 727
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:43:26 gatDAYMN
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:43:44 and it flies
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:46:14 the wings looked like it had no wing panels on it at first - now that i see it, i see it does
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:46:52 bold of you to assume i had a brain in the first place

contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:31:36 could you curve the top of the cockpit windows a tiny bit? 🤔
contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:48:58 wh.... uhhhh
contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:51:54 Slightly off topic - I find it pretty cool how I've improved so much in the game, that C5 aircraft i made is so bad to me now - i've rebuilt it with more compact gear, an improved door and tail, and custom angle lock everything - i didnt even use motor lock on that build
contest-chat 2022-12-05 03:54:13 But what I said there, I was just really happy that my first build was up to the standards of most others and not just constant downvotes, it really motivated me to keep playing - but honestly, it's really bad to my current standards now
creations-chat 2022-12-05 03:56:18 how good are you at custom angle motor lock?
creations-chat 2022-12-05 03:58:54 Lol
creations-chat 2022-12-05 04:01:02 Do you want help with custom angle motor locking? *get more skills?*
creations-chat 2022-12-05 04:30:28 gear go up?

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:40:43 (the 747 didnt unfold properly so it might look a bit odd)
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:41:51 2 accounts - I could get my third in and park a plane in between them
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:41:58

plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:26:37 
creations-chat 2022-12-06 04:30:42 be honest - so you can be harsh
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:31:04 there's a third one i got :>
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 04:34:17 now we got 4 and the E3 isn't mine
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:10:09 thanks :> and how could i improve both aircraft?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:24:52 I have got both the B-52D and B-52H, this -D has those smooth smaller turbojet engines, and the newer -H has the more powerful engines turbofans  (I don't know the types sadly) 
Also the -D has an internal bomb bay that's 100% usable (because it's the Big Belly aircraft), and the -H has a few Nukes in it that also drop

creations-chat 2022-12-06 05:37:46 <@862160384206962749> I'll be honest, I didn't quite understand what you just said - but I've loaded in and here's the engine, I have NO space for motor lock - but this is where the smoke pipe on the front is inspired from, how else could i improve it?
creations-chat 2022-12-06 07:09:46 very interesting but oki :>

contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:39:33 This is my first comp since I was blacklisted last Christmas for asking if I could make a 747 ... In the wrong channel
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:40:09 Nothing else? No contribution award? Not even a pat on the back?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:40:58 I'd like to file a complaint against myself, I am disabled, gimme extra points for effort as compensation for smol brain
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:42:09 - all jokes aside, I don't mind it at all, it's cool to think I could've came first if we didn't let the sea stallion in
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:42:28 Plus, I think it's fun *and we always got next competition*
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:43:28 Well so far the sea stallion has always been in first place
contest-chat 2022-12-07 07:44:03 Oh it's a king stallion, my bad - I made a sea stallion a while back hence the mix-up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:58:49 I got one rocket that is realistic - but now Roblox un-folds the locked motors and I can't use it anymore
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:36 It's my proton M rocket <:nooo:787097964946259978>
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:50 Is that good or bad?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:56 It's in creations

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:01:00 *loading*
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:01:08 Oo yes it is
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:02:52 It by definition, still works, but it doesn't unfold the bottom rockets into its proper position, or the trails that are in that weird interstage fairing
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:03:37 Sheeesh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:04:22 Tbh I'm in the city so I'm using data - I'll check when I'm home
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:04:45 I was just being polite before regarding searching my proton rocket

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:12 I like looking back at it tbh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:26 Like what I should make for Christmas
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:31 I still have no idea
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:56 I was thinking a C-17 and dump prezzies inside to drop
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:16:01 But that's bad
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:17:11 Oh no I mean mine

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:04 Ooooooo
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:09 I like that idea a lot
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:25 A gru rocket ship - but Christmas tree
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:03 Loolll good ideas
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:28 Imma actually do that though - unless I find something absolutely ground breaking to build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:55 The.. the first stage is recoverable? Or the final stage
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:21:58 Good idea
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:26:21 I'm going to say easy, I've made landing gears for all sorts of aircraft, this can't be too hard to fit a satellite in it.. right?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:15 Imma add your name to it if I remember
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:35 Imma add it on a present box, which will be the satellite
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:32:15 Sure thing... No clue how to make a small box and then have it telescope out into a telescope unless I turn it into a transformer but sure
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:35:02 Noice
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:37:00 I'm literally on a train, I'm planning to make a whole plot worth of gru rocket
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:40:19 Sure thing,
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:41:04 I was thinking of a 2x2x2 box with some blocks on top as bowties as the payload - so if you can turn that into a literal telescope, that'd be great
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:48:03 yUH

contest-chat 2022-12-08 02:42:15 you know what
contest-chat 2022-12-08 02:42:23 maybe it's best that i don't do this competition'
contest-chat 2022-12-14 09:59:30 start again - a week of progress aint much
contest-chat 2022-12-14 11:44:52 same, i've thought up plans though
contest-chat 2022-12-23 02:23:24 exposed motor!!!!!
contest-chat 2022-12-23 02:24:09 this looks really really good though :>
the mirrors look odd though, if it's possible, maybe angle it back
contest-chat 2022-12-23 03:40:56 😱
contest-chat 2022-12-24 22:06:18 honestly i find it funny how when i first made custom angle motor lock, i put blocks in the way to stop the motor from turning at the point it needs to stop, i did this for all custom angle motors  - and now that roblox no work properly, only those builds are the ones that i can unfold
contest-chat 2022-12-24 22:09:35 also, i might not join this contest - i'm pretty busy and i haven't started
creations-chat 2022-12-24 22:12:45 this looks really good, i've made one myself with very similar methods (but i might get "inspiration" from this design)

also the tail is wonky
creations-chat 2022-12-24 22:14:48 yeah, you can see one piece is a bit further behind than the other
help 2023-01-01 13:31:28 i have been summoned
help 2023-01-01 13:31:58 so does everyone know me for my Ornithopter aircraft?
help 2023-01-01 13:33:04 I'll make a tutorial actually - however it will not be soon as I have no clue how to make videos
creations-chat 2023-01-08 00:21:34 nope.
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:47:37 Should I put the B-52H in Creations? or the B-52D?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:48:12 that means i have to load both - alright Give me a Second to do so
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:57:02 (ignore any discrepancies regarding my terrible folding)
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:58:07 shaders - i could remove it, i just added it for *aesthetics* ✨
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:59:32 how could I improve the landing gear? it's compact enough to fold inwards realistically which took forever to get working
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:01:22 that's the appearance due to perspective I believe, it looks pretty much like that IRL (technically further by the smallest margains, not enough for me to make it half a block wider)

creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:10:35 I also was supposed to get it to say Tupolev in Russian but I had issue regarding tags, I'll put it on tomorrow when I can


Very lucky simply, I'd love to hop in one myself

And no, not wrong ping
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:16:34 I'll be honest, it's 3 in the morning and these pings are what's keeping me up - I do but I responded with the first sentence to who I replied to and I just couldn't be bothered to ping Simply for the 2nd sentence (the one for them)
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:25:37 Just like me fr

creations-chat 2023-01-16 10:07:52 Why your wings have so much holes in them? Do you know how to motor lock? Would you like help?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 02:54:18 your engines are so massive compared to the real thing 👀
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:11:53 i... dont think that looks close to the real thing - no offence


ye, you got this mate :>
remember to use a lot of motor lock >:)
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:14:11 I am really good at building landing gear, what bomber will you make? I can help you make it  (disclaimer, I will most likely use a lot of motor lock)
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:16:15 B52 and a C-5? That's easy, let me build both of those aircraft for you right now in record time
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:20:53 oh wow I just built most of a Lockheed Martin C-5M Super Galaxy in about 4 minutes!!!!!! 
Anyways here, I can show you the landing gear mechanism for it too
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:27:34 and yes, I come ABSOLUTELY prepared for this one encounter to show landing gear of 2 largest military aircraft - because I have both aircrafts and videos

(first video I just made because I can, it's me showing the mechanism in spawn and launched)

(old video of the C5 gear during testing)

no suspension in any of these gears due to kraken sadly
creations-chat 2023-01-19 09:35:46 I got a 777 but the nose gear door is average - I got a 747 which works
but I cannot switch to that account currently - that B52 is on another account, I'm just lucky I saved videos of it
creations-chat 2023-01-19 12:19:14 yoooo niceee (try to hide the motor lock though, people will tell you off for it, ask me how i know 🫢 )
