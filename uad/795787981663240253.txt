Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight

And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:33:21 I delete it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:33:57 I couldn’t put steering in because the drive shaft was in the way 😭
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:34:08 I have a few other cars but they are rear wheel drive
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:34:23 Fr
