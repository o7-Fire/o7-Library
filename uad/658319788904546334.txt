general 2020-03-30 04:36:51 <@435946988559925248> why would you need a Boeing when you could get a private jet
general 2020-03-30 04:37:39 But why would you need the room, also can you please shut the fuck up with the image <@287459677611098114>
general 2020-03-30 04:38:54 I'm being rude to image man, not you
general 2020-03-30 04:40:54 The smaller plane will be my house and don't forget it'll be more economically safe with the fuel economy
general 2020-03-30 04:41:41 You do realize they don't fill the tanks
general 2020-03-30 04:42:07 They only fill the tanks to as much as they need to go
general 2020-03-30 04:42:32 Therefore your increased load means nothing as you will take more time to fill your load
general 2020-03-30 04:44:46 Do what
general 2020-03-30 04:47:02 Yeah, it's more efficient and if you completely filled the tanks you would add more weight to the plane meaning you would put unnecessary stress on the plane
general 2020-03-30 04:48:48 Why ask the questions when you can search it up with the computer in your hands
general 2020-03-30 04:51:02 If you did you would completely fuck the fuel economy of it

general 2020-07-06 04:28:41 Exactly
general 2020-07-06 04:28:57 It removes variety from pvp
general 2020-07-06 04:29:48 The only reason I'm classified as a rocket spammer is because I try using them as a main gun for my tank
general 2020-07-06 04:30:54 So not when I make a tube and bind them all to a key
general 2020-07-06 04:31:26 Because the channel was un-american
general 2020-07-06 04:32:57 I am the aura

general 2020-07-06 04:43:18 In my opinion, people who put focus on looks for a PvP vehicles can make some of the least functional in the game
general 2020-07-06 04:44:40 I'm sorry that you think that jimmy_2007 but can you're fucking long tiger beat my stack gun

creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:55:07 I have a challenge for you
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:57:09 make an entire plane around the gun, not just wings and tail, could be something comparable to an ac-130, could be compared to an A-10, choice is up to you, but that is my challenge.
creations-chat 2021-10-10 07:00:24 I wanna see you make something that the gun can fit into, and if it manages to stay balanced for that matter. in practically, literally the phrase "building a plane around the gun"
creations-chat 2021-10-10 07:09:23 Fair point, however, funy
