creations-chat 2020-08-04 09:08:09 You can see who downvoted, so its weird question
help 2020-08-04 12:11:40 It wont take off, probally because its way to heavy.

Each wing has 4 super rockets engines, 1 huge rockets engine and 1 huge jet engine. And are seperate controllable by power increase and rotation.

At the moment im filling it up with helium which I center in setting of helium. Now it moves, but i cant control it and it wont really fly, more float with power behind.

Is it worth to make the wing engine containment somewhat bigger and add maybe a few extra super rockets engines or do i just need to accept this thing can never fly inside this package?
help 2020-08-04 12:12:25 its 1613 block atm with the helium installment if that mattesr
help 2020-08-04 12:13:06 I have none wings, cuz the ship i replicate just has 2 big engines. I hoped i could control it with the seperatble engiens
help 2020-08-04 12:13:08 engines
help 2020-08-04 12:13:53 jup its got a bit out of hand, the roof got a bump unfortunate
help 2020-08-04 12:15:41 I will try first to put engines inside the ship does the output behind it need to be open? Or wil it just work in a close containment?

If that doesnt work i will try to use the wings inside, but i feels really clunky to use your mouse to steer
help 2020-08-04 13:23:17 I have given up. I added engines and wings. But i should probally have multiple wings in the back and front or something. Atm i just want the paint job done.

But thanks for all the suggestions
