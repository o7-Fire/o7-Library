creations-chat 2021-08-21 19:35:11 How do y'all do ropes on ships? I know people use unpowered trail blocks and stuff, but I like how this looks. It isn't much worth it, though, since the motorlock lags when it's destroyed.

help 2021-08-24 19:57:42 Any ideas on how I can get this spaceship to fly? I've never really been able to make them hover/fly.
help 2021-08-24 19:57:55 might've gone overboard on motorlock, too
help 2021-08-24 19:58:21 First time I've actually used it to build things
help 2021-08-24 19:58:59 yeah, Ive tried with it and cant seem to get it stable
help 2021-08-24 19:59:34 gravity slider gives me too little control since small movements get out of hand, especially on something as small as this
help 2021-08-24 20:07:01 Probably something with how I can't seem to get my engines place well enough to keep it stable whilst flying. It still loses control despite all the wings I added.
help 2021-08-24 20:07:18 for now I might try and get lucky with engine placement
help 2021-08-24 21:25:44 get to level 3 by chatting
help 2021-08-24 22:21:43 Got it to fly well, but i'm not particularly happy now cause some guy just copied it with exploits. Had some random letters name, so I couldn't get it.
help 2021-08-24 22:21:48 Good luck to him cause its gonna take ages for him to get that thing to fly if he has no controls

plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:11:20 PC2 could pass by without remodels of blocks. Not much to hate about blocks now
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:11:46 we've already found such creative uses for all the blocks they've given us, so It'd be weird to change it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:14:10 The game has been focused on functionality over looks, but it's definitely changed to where builds look very good even despite the grid build system
