plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:39:38 it does not "fucking suck" lol it looks pretty good tbh
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:40:33 Well when you show up and the first thing you see is "that f18 fucking sucks, looks nothing like it" it doesn't look like a joke lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:40:50 especially in a community notorious for being full of elitist assholes
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:40:58 I mean sorry but like

the-dump 2021-12-12 21:23:07 OH NO-  ðŸ”¨ðŸ’¥
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 23:25:59 "chainhook" lmao
the-dump 2021-12-14 04:07:47 holy shit that sound effect gives me ptsd
the-dump 2021-12-14 04:47:38 Subspace tripmine, it's an invisible landmine that earrapes you when it goes off, also turns everything it hits pink. I remember it from Shedletsky's game "a bridge too far", a game where you blow up a cool bridge. You place one and forget it's there, then you accidentally touch it and it gives you a literal heart attack. Even worse when you're the only one in the server bc you don't expect it. But yeah, basically a surreal jumpscare landmine
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 15:17:00 I want to build something that uses lots of motor2 in both modes to make something that's either practical for PVP or just really fun and unique to drive, anyone got any ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 15:59:37 wtf why can't we add reactions here
the-dump 2021-12-16 16:01:48 Is this a turbo tas? Or is this a regular tas using new tech I haven't seen yet
general 2021-12-18 06:27:00 good
general 2021-12-18 06:28:01 yes lol why would it be the thumbnail if it didn't work

also it's literally the old tutorial plane
general 2021-12-18 06:28:29 yeah before the current one with fuel and stuff
general 2021-12-18 06:28:40 I'm pretty sure anyways
general 2021-12-18 06:30:13 bruh
general 2021-12-18 06:30:18 correct
general 2021-12-18 06:30:30 basically roblox devs are special and don't know how to optimize physics
general 2021-12-18 06:30:58 I can't call roblox devs rarted? I think that's something we can all agree on
general 2021-12-18 06:31:13 bruh
general 2021-12-18 06:31:39 but yeah <@!573545578001334272> it calculates water physics for every part in contact with water
general 2021-12-18 06:31:49 also are y'all serious
general 2021-12-18 06:32:17 so if you build a boat or something, have as little parts as possible touch the water
general 2021-12-18 06:32:29 that's why hydrofoils and stuff perform so well on the water
general 2021-12-18 06:32:44 bc they have low part counts touching the water, everything else hovers just above
general 2021-12-18 06:32:57 that should help
general 2021-12-18 06:33:26 also if it looks good, you can use helium to raise your boat higher out of the water

creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:49:04 what the fuck are the upvote/downvote standards of this community
creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:52:02 generic battleship or tank for the 83487th time = 7987 upvotes 12 downvotes
neat unique plane = 14 upvotes 987 downvotes

historically and physically accurate recreation of a cool plane = 15 upvotes 200 downvotes
literally the same plane but uglier = 200 upvotes and 15 downvotes (they used motor lock to clip stuff together so it's automatically better)
creations-chat 2021-12-18 06:59:14 I GOT WARNED FOR SAYING BOO OOB? This server is an absolute nightmare

creations-chat 2022-03-07 06:05:05 this server is the epitome of touch grass + shower + talk to women

creations-chat 2022-03-07 06:08:50 wait what's wrong with antilgbt lol, they shame eachother into supporting eachother and it's a toxic endless feedback loop that causes people to negatively change themselves to conform to social pressures by submitting to the flow
plane-crazy 2022-04-14 19:10:18 Yeah I see, I do mine with propellers but I'll have to try it with hovers too

events-chat 2022-07-17 19:58:07 AR2 doesn't run for more than 5 minutes without crashing
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:58:55 I have an RTX3050 and 32GB RAM on top of a 12th gen 12 core i5 and AR2 crashes like every time I do something
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:59:12 Like touching water just crashes me like half the time
events-chat 2022-07-17 19:59:59 It's insane that AR2 has been early access for what like 3 years? And it crashes. What other roblox game crashes, that literally just doesn't happen
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:00:18 Oh and the running animation is goofy af lol
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:01:33 To me it feels like there's some gross serverside memory leak or smth bc servers destabilize over time
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:03:34 burh
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:03:54 Incredibly disappointing because AR1 was kickass
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:04:10 Like it was just SO GOOD
Everything just worked
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:04:46 The world felt lived in and full, the guns felt great, PvP was balanced, good zombie density, etc
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:05:08 I saw AR2 and was like hooooly shit how can they make this better
events-chat 2022-07-17 20:05:24 I need to stop getting excited for things
general 2022-09-02 05:57:03 WHAT
general 2022-09-02 05:57:21 THE WORD MECHANIC GAME IS BANNED
general 2022-09-02 05:57:47 smh rick got outdone and is so salty he banned the game from his server
general 2022-09-02 05:58:46 I mean it does have like, *literally everything* players have been asking for
general 2022-09-02 05:58:56 dude made it because he was unhappy with PC lol
general 2022-09-02 05:59:29 lol
general 2022-09-02 06:00:20 ik
general 2022-09-02 06:00:28 ok literally false
general 2022-09-02 06:00:49 it's car based instead of plane based
general 2022-09-02 06:00:58 gears, passthroughs, etc
general 2022-09-02 06:01:10 you can make everything in mech too
general 2022-09-02 06:01:48 mechanic just requires actual thinking and engineering and you can't just bullsh*t it like in PC
general 2022-09-02 06:01:57 I built a functional plane
general 2022-09-02 06:02:02 it takes time
general 2022-09-02 06:02:08 balancing things
general 2022-09-02 06:02:17 I'm not
general 2022-09-02 06:02:26 PC has its own merit in that aspect
general 2022-09-02 06:02:32 I'm not saying that's bad
general 2022-09-02 06:02:39 I'm saying it's different
general 2022-09-02 06:02:48 lol are you like 15
general 2022-09-02 06:03:17 lol london 2.0
general 2022-09-02 06:03:30 literally bragging on living in a shitty town
general 2022-09-02 06:04:09 I'm saying maybe what you interpret as shit talking you do so because you live in an area of subpar average intelligence
general 2022-09-02 06:04:33 I literally just said you can't bullshit it
general 2022-09-02 06:04:42 in pc literally anything will fly
general 2022-09-02 06:04:45 that's not a bad thing
general 2022-09-02 06:04:52 it provides greater creative freedom
general 2022-09-02 06:04:58 mechanic is like hardcore pc
general 2022-09-02 06:05:24 less creative freedom but the fun is the challenge in the puzzle of figuring out how to make it work
general 2022-09-02 06:05:37 again there's nothing wrong with how pc is
general 2022-09-02 06:05:54 I'm so confused rn
general 2022-09-02 06:06:12 "whitename lol" refuses to actually argue
general 2022-09-02 06:06:21 do you have any actual rebuttle
general 2022-09-02 06:06:32 are you special
general 2022-09-02 06:06:44 rebuking
general 2022-09-02 06:07:02 it's literally just different
general 2022-09-02 06:07:06 not better or worse
general 2022-09-02 06:07:09 just different
general 2022-09-02 06:07:16 you are so hung up on that rn
general 2022-09-02 06:07:37 cliff is trying to say that I'm saying pc is shit because it's easy to make something that flies
general 2022-09-02 06:07:44 which is not what I'm saying lol
general 2022-09-02 06:07:58 no bc it's 1:00 AM and I need sleep
general 2022-09-02 06:08:04 cliff you're an idiot

general 2022-09-06 07:18:51 tick tock paint
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:12 this argument is stupid, if it's a plane designed to damage things it's an attack aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:47 but that is literally what attack aircraft means
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:50 attack
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:01:52 aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:02 a bomber is an attack aircraft lol
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:21 yes
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:25 literally yes lol
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:02:39 but is it not an aircraft that attacks
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:03:22 twas a novelty statement
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:03:28 simply tomfoolery
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:04:19 technically any aircraft can be an attack aircraft but only once
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:05:34 but where's the lie
contest-chat 2022-09-06 19:06:22 kek
general 2023-03-15 05:48:20 so... what's up with pc2? I haven't touched roblox in like 2 years
