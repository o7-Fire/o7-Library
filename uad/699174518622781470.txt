general 2023-04-02 05:52:22 Why is that to send a suggestion, or get more perks or MORE ACCESS TO useful stuff in the server, **I HAVE TO GET RANKED?**

Like seriously! Getting ranked is too hard! I have to build a creation that everyone must like and if there is more downvotes, I won't get a rank!

Also, I live outside of the US so barely any moderators see my ticket and I have to wait 6 hours for a response!
general 2023-04-02 05:53:35 HOW TO GET A RANK:
1. Make a super good creation
2. Make a video of it.
3. Post it on your ticket/creations.
4. IF YOU GET MORE DOWNVOTES YOU WON'T GET THE ROLE
general 2023-04-02 05:54:00 yes!!
general 2023-04-02 05:55:46 Dude, I live in a part of Southeast Asia. Here is 12:56PM in the afternoon but at the US ITS 12:56AM!!!!
general 2023-04-02 05:57:00 There is no way I could response while I'm sleeping, including if I want to send a response quick, I can't.

Also let me show you the steps on how to get a role.

general 2023-04-02 05:57:42 1. Make a good creation

general 2023-04-02 08:29:13 Google says: Why is it called planes?
‚ÄúIn the French from which it was borrowed, the 'plane' is related to a geometrical plane (flat surface), which then became the name of the flat parts of flying machines that allow them to achieve lift,‚Äù says Murphy.

general 2023-04-02 08:29:55 What is the meaning of planes and name the 3 types?
Coronal (frontal) plane: separates the front (anterior) and back (posterior) of the body. Sagittal (longitudinal) plane: separates the left and right sides of the body. Transverse (axial) plane: separates the upper (superior) and lower (inferior) halves of the body.

general 2023-04-02 08:34:38 Want me to explain more?
general 2023-04-02 08:35:19 HELICOPTER: a type of aircraft which derives both lift and propulsion from one or more sets of horizontally revolving overhead rotors. It is capable of moving vertically and horizontally, the direction of motion being controlled by the pitch of the rotor blades. It's kinda like a flying box, but it's simple.
general 2023-04-02 08:35:45 It could be a prison
