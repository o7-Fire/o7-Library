creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:12:45 so I have a quick question: do any of you guys still partly use mouse controls? I feel like it's good for when you don't want to full on into a a turn
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:18:30 I use the mouse keys for stuff like ultra-sharp turns that I can't pull with the regular keys. I have also found that control surfaces seem to have a max turn radius when using a mouse
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:30:26 > <@!672912304064430097> 
> I don't understand this .
<@!563462654090543114> I built this plane that on paper should have been highly manuverable and foundit to sluggish and I deciced to create airleons and elevators using the keyboard and it felt amazing! I didn't keybind all of the control surfaces so that I can just cruise and make slight adjustiments or full commit to a hard bank.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 00:36:30 this is my plane, it's a bit of flat boi and I like it that way

general 2020-11-19 03:38:28 I have a idea for a new Discord game: I call it Do You Know? Basically the jist of the game is to pick the right answer from a list of 3 options. Two are half truths but the key is you get points if you 'sabotage' other people by convincing them to pick a half truth. For example, the topic is cars

Did you know that mid-engine cars have been around for more than 100 years?

Did you know that NASCAR used a LS engine?

Did you know that there is an actual 'King' car called the Dodge Roadrunner?

If you manage to convince someone to pick one of the half truths you get a point but if you pick the right answer you get 3. The person with the most points at the end wins.
general 2020-11-19 03:39:57 Lol
general 2020-11-19 03:41:05 And did you know that the Dodge Viper isn't a killing machine sent back in time to wipe out Dodge customers?

general 2020-11-19 03:43:43 Also imagine if plane crazy had actual car engines?

general 2020-11-19 03:56:24 https://youtu.be/NYUI1MVj4tA
Just a reference
general 2020-11-19 04:01:32 But the thing is that just because its accessible doesn't mean it still doesn't kick ass and take names on the track for a fraction of the price. It is extremely low end supercar that can beat a few higher in cars on track days and look amazing doing it. I will defend this car because it honestly doesn't get the respect it deserves. <@738702049113538600>

plane-crazy 2020-11-27 07:54:23 Does setting the gravity higher add more downforce ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 07:55:06 Because I was testing my car and it felt like it had more grip on higher gravity

general 2020-12-28 06:27:10 I am going to create the Plane Crazy Super Modified Series. Basically the only limits are that the car has 4 wheels, only 2 sources of propulsion, and that it comes in between 120 to 150 blocks. Other than that you can go hog wild with what you build.
general 2020-12-28 06:28:11 We'll race around the airport
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 06:48:38 Here are the working specs for the Plane Crazy Super Modified Series

Wheelbase: 7 to 10 blocks long
Engines Allowed: Rockets, jets, motor spin/ base wheel spin. All other forms of propulsion are strictly prohibited
Size Requirements: Your car must be between 120 and 150 blocks
Front and rear wings are allowed as well as weight offsets are allowed

general 2021-07-16 07:36:37 Imagine being in the front row of a 600 foot drop on a floorless coaster
general 2021-07-16 07:39:59 Not the same ride but a similar one that UK haven't finished yet 

https://streamable.com/4qy2s7
general 2021-07-16 07:45:34 It's a floorless coaster, so instead of the car sitting on the track it its suspended underneath the track
general 2021-07-16 07:46:25 Basically like a ski lift
general 2021-07-16 07:47:01 How's the coaster overall?
general 2021-07-16 08:03:48 https://streamable.com/i8befo

Here you, the full ride at the moment
general 2021-07-16 08:05:41 Yeah that inversion on the lift hill is probably at 300 feet
general 2021-07-16 08:07:25 And the launch at the top is designed make you lose your crap right at the top of the hill before being sent down at 55 miles per hour plus

general 2021-07-19 10:02:08 I can see how the final drop with the really sharp pull up would be a problem but everything else seems fine
general 2021-07-19 10:11:44 600 foot first drop
general 2021-07-19 10:12:48 I might need to add trims there
general 2021-07-19 10:13:41 Trim brakes to slow the coaster down a bit
general 2021-07-19 10:14:49 That first drop in RL would be terrifying

general 2021-07-19 10:18:50 I've been to a few arcades that have those 360 motion coaster rigs. That's what I was thinking

the-dump 2022-01-03 20:35:20 Anyone want a proof that infinity divided by infinity is infinity?
the-dump 2022-01-03 20:42:38 1. Create a set of all whole numbers from one to infinity
2. Create a set of all decimal numbers between 1 and 2. This set should include every number from 1 to ♾ in decimal form
3. Create a new decimal number by taking the first digit of the first number, the second digit of the second number, and so on until infinity 


You can repeat this process infinitely, resulting in the set of decimal numbers being infinitely times bigger than the set of real numbers. 
Which written another way is infinity/infinity=infinity
