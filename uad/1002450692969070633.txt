creations-chat 2023-04-09 23:31:54 <@989353863695966209> I’m just an average mini builder who doesn’t care enough to beg for roles here, here’s my builds if it means anything

creations-chat 2023-04-10 01:30:35 The whole point is for it to be one of the few good mini builds out there, but it’s more of a bet than a challenge

creations-chat 2023-04-15 05:58:36 What is an efficient way for me to discriminate against white people without it being self hate?
creations-chat 2023-04-15 17:06:51 You said white name and speechbubble, if you’re gonna insult me atleast make it good or creative to some extent
creations-chat 2023-04-15 19:13:05 “I have better things to do” *writes a whole paragraph explanation on why him failing to insult me wasn’t insulting me*

creations-chat 2023-04-24 00:54:01 This you!? Also I’m not sure abt you, but the pcc is one of the saddest group of nobodies who care too much abt anything (you proved me right twice just now) the truth is, you have nothing in life to care abt and nobody in your life that cares abt you. So you take the only social life you have (discord) and try to find drama in whatever you can. You look for this attention online bc your parents never gave it to you (this explains the furry pfp) and there’s literally nothing you can do to prove me wrong bc you know I’m right, and you simply CHOOSE not to accept it. Just like your family never accepted you ❤️

creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:05:11 ikr? everyone here is so dry. and they throw a hissy-fit when they see me post a good mini build. it simply enrages this community to hear the word "mini" and they expect me to care abt their opinions 😭
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:13:21 any ideas? no..? give me something to work with next time.
creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:16:30 its one block wide 🤦‍♂️

creations-chat 2023-05-27 17:59:39 boohoo ig :(((((
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:21:35 im not above anything, just ppl's rude ass comments
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:25:22 again, i dont care how other ppl see me. i know what "good" is, and i think i have the right to call my stuff good if it looks better than other things. im not gonna sugarcoat it or ask for attention, i think its good. why is this a problem
creations-chat 2023-05-27 18:29:58 and why does this matter so much rn?
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:10:04 again, i dont care ✋ 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:12:06 yea but everyone talking shit has no good builds to shit on 💀 (ima go play warthunder

creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:34:34 ima go take a shower brb
creations-chat 2023-05-27 19:39:13 preesh man ❤️ look, only criticizm i want is what livery i should give it next. if theres a good looking camo you think would fit on my mig, @ me and ill consider it
creations-chat 2023-05-28 03:18:24 Wait til he finds out ✋💀
creations-chat 2023-05-28 03:26:21 It’s all cam lock
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:02:32 What??
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:05:07 Look at the seat above it. Do you not believe me or something?
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:08:46 I used sparklers but I exploded the box thing. I build for the Mini Build Fan Club, that’s why I made this so small. Don’t hate me for it, bc odds are I made this mini AND above the average standard for PCC (I’m working on making the body one block longer, I messed up the dimensions lol)
creations-chat 2023-05-28 06:11:10 I can do a comparison photo tmr
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:25:00 Fuck everyone else, don’t build for anyone but yourself. You can take breaks, bc you don’t need to please anyone but you. Build knowing that you’re impressive enough for you, and that no one else’s shitty opinions can change you. Figure out the hard way, it’s how you learn from your mistakes
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:27:33 Goddamn
creations-chat 2023-05-29 18:17:47 Y’all, what kind of new livery should I give my mig-19?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 19:40:48 Ye, I used exploded sparklers for the canopy
creations-chat 2023-05-29 20:57:05 It’s 1x1
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:01:08 Sparklers but with tnt to explode the square parts (and a horn’s ball to connect the front of the canopy to the back)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:03:23 Has to go above 500 sps, or it’ll stall out. Other than that, the basic control surfaces work wonders. It’s very smooth, and it it had landing gear it could butter easily
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:05:55 I’ll tnt explode the box part of the game’s stock landing gear, and hide it in the fuselage arranged at an angle like in the rear gears of the f16, and then normal for the nose (tnt modified again)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:08:17 Also <@774081211860516864>, I can hide trapdoors in the cylinder body so that when the gear goes down, it looks like there’s a landing gear bay too 🙂 [thanks 👍]
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:10:36 I’ve reached that point in plane crazy where I feel like I’m getting good 🦍
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:13:55 If you’re doing 2x2 mig-19PL, use a half ball angled for the top of the air intake for that Sabre like indent, and a backwards 1x1 jet engine with a horn ball locked at the tip of the nozzle for a clean and smooth radar
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:16:06 With this, https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1112849327220609024
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:20:41 That’s gonna be my first edit, I hate the PL
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:22:50 400 cameras, 4 wings that are each less than 2 blocks wide. You can fit a hover engine in there if you tnt modify the motor
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:24:56 Did you see it despawned? 400 cameras more or less (<@774081211860516864> I agree 100%)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:27:09 Yup, I reached my plot border on all sides except one block at the back

creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:38:41 Mhm.. it’s the ladder color… (I think he’s jealous it looks better than his builds) we do a mild amount of trolling around here <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:40:51 <@567763933952475157> I humbly disagree (oh boy, they’re cooking ✋🤣)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:43:16 Ima be honest, I just wanted to start something (it was getting a little dry here)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:46:22 Besides the fact that I need to increase the length by about a block, I think my mig looks smoother, and has a better livery (‼️MY OPINION‼️)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:48:29 Make this a speechbubble
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:54:43 Istg every time I post something here, I get dms like “how did you do that? Can you help me build this? I wanna be like you! How’d you make it that small???” I’m fr gonna cry
creations-chat 2023-05-29 21:57:01 Exposed trapdoor. Thought it’d make the wings look depth-ier, but ig not. I’ll delete it

creations-chat 2023-05-29 22:59:43 (Only has likes bc it’s big) this server really doesn’t like that I make mini builds tho lol, I can’t tell you how much heat I’ve gotten simply because I make small tanks and jets
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:03:32 Nah but fr. Considering how big that thing is, it should be hella smooth with pinpoint accuracy. I’m surprised you didn’t go all the way (<@1004207882784489472> I was originally talking abt the most recent two of our posts, not your shitty status in this even shittier community ✋💀)
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:05:37 <@1004207882784489472>, you can’t say bad words 😹😹😹
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:11:18 Some old stuff that I’m surprised got as many likes as they did, they got a ton of downvotes bc ppl don’t like mini builds, good or bad
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:13:42 Ironically, most of the 9-10 people who did downvote my builds just don’t like me personally lol
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:16:06 Ik, even when they are above average, ppl still just won’t hop off. Repeatedly calling them shitty, and telling me to quit PC lmao
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:19:09 Yes. Also ppl always compare me to <@559568621312147476> bc he’s the only one here who is recognized for making good mini builds. If my shit isn’t as good as his, it’s not enough. And even when they are as good as stuff like his Tiger, there’s still someone there to talk shit
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:21:12 I haven’t been here long enough to know who he is, can you send some of his builds?
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:25:07 Oh shit nvm I remember now lol
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:32:51 Nobody likes mini builds, and this community isn’t as active as it was a while ago. That’s why you don’t see as many likes on things now, many ppl quit, or lost interest. I wasn’t here for that period of pcc. Sorry I’m not the best, but I’m damn good
creations-chat 2023-05-29 23:36:19 And I don’t need 400 upvotes to prove it (7 ppl are online at a time nowadays)
creations-chat 2023-05-30 00:15:21 Nah <@1004207882784489472> that’s insane

creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:43:12 Y’all need to chill the fuck out, I’m still working on it. Like goddamn, y’all suck ass and attack me when something turns out below average. Fr stop riding my meat ✋
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 01:52:50 Can someone overlay this with a MiG-19S blueprint?
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:54:23 Can someone overlay this with a MiG-19S blueprint?

creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:23:43 Bitch your profile picture is prolly a 10/10 that you fumbled, and you don’t even have builds here to talk shit abt. You is prolly the loneliest, most unproductive mf on this damn server
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:26:35 Ok there’s only so much I can do with a mini build, and I’m working. I like the way this is turning out
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:28:41 Yup, that’s basically what a Mig is, not sure what you want me to do abt it
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:30:47 Wrong variant, sorry (<@960280428911153163> still being added, it’s tough making room for all the camera lock when I’ve reached my plot borders on all sides)
