plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:56:31 is anyone else having all of their blocks say "Loading..."?
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:00:47 it fixed
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:01:07 it got fixed
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:01:21 for me the loading went away
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:02:09 I can't add pictures for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:04:13 it seems it fixes for random people at random times
bot-central 2022-04-02 15:05:37 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:07:21 for me it fixed itself, but it seems it only happens to a few people
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:07:35 so you might have to be lucky for it to go away
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:17:42 you can say that again
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:18:09 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:18:28 it seems like an issue big enough to dm him
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:18:38 but idk, check the rules first
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:19:32 don't ping him on second thought
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:19:36 ping a staff member
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:20:43 well if everyone is having the issue, maybe we should wait it out and not ping anyone
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:20:49 outside of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:21:16 lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:21:48 even war thunder is having issues
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:22:48 for now we unfortunately need to wait for a patch before we can build
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:23:05 lucky
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:24:20 by the way, did the 6 second audio thing come into effect yet?
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:24:32 oh, sad
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:26:15 wait
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:26:21 the glitch went away for me
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:26:23 completely
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:27:20 for me there is no weird duplicate items thing nor "Loading..." anymore
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:27:38 but I am sure that luxury will be short lived
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:34:33 as I suspected me not having the glitch was a short lived luxury, it says "Loading..." once again
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:35:04 does anyone know what is happening to roblox? are there any raids today or massive game update?
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:36:05 make an F-15 eagle
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:36:42 that is pretty good
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:38:47 yeah it is a roblox issue, I checked down detector and it seems the reports sky-rocketed at around 10:30
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:41:30 some issue with roblox
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:44:43 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:45:09 yeah, roblox is going bezerk
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:46:28 yep, very normal

general 2022-05-03 23:05:42 8000 reports? this must be bad if it is that fast
general 2022-05-03 23:08:34 the way to know if roblox is down is if every roblox related discord server is blowing up with comments

general 2022-10-09 13:08:10 for sure but what my point is there is not really any country out there that fully admits to crimes they did
general 2022-10-09 13:09:13 like dropping a nuclear bomb on a civilian city seemed like an improper way to end the war, dropping them on military targets would have been more useful

the-dump 2023-06-10 17:04:34 the remote turret is a good idea, making it so that crew survivability is sky high
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:06:29 it’s relevant
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:06:43 shows that tanks can be absolutely useless if used incorrectly
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:14 in this case, it shows that western tech, just like all other tank tech, is prone to artillery strikes
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:30 T-14 armanta, toast in artillery
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:07:40 Abrams X, toast in artillery
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:08:14 all tanks are horrible at withstanding artillery strikes due to the sheer power and size a artillery shell has
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:09:05 and like almost all tanks out there, some have been captured
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:09:16 ISIS has a few Abrams that were captured
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:10:23 the small differences in tech doesn’t mean much, a tank is still a tank and will cause a massive amount of destruction no matter how old it is
the-dump 2023-06-10 17:10:46 it all comes down to training and circumstances
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:17:45 yea idk what it’s for
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:17:56 it seems to try to be everything
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:18:08 I discovered a design flaw with it
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:18:38 if you hit the turret ring at a specific angle, it will kill the entire crew
the-dump 2023-06-10 19:20:26 and it will weld the turret to the chassis and a lot more bad stuff, making it so that it is 100% impossible to salvage a destroyed Abrams X
the-dump 2023-06-10 23:30:15 it’s a design flaw
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:13:20 no design is perfect
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:13:42 the T-14 and Abrams X have some major design flaws
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:14:01 but they’re both extremely impressive technology that is a proof of concept
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:14:39 reliable? absolutely not, they are to push to forefront of technology and hopefully pave the way for iterations on the proofs of concept
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:16:23 imo aircraft are a different story, a proof of concept is very rare amongst new aircraft
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:17:05 they tend to be a lot more conservative and a lot less gamebreaking technology that pushes the forefront of human imagination
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:17:24 only small improvements between each aircraft model
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:18:35 but the T-14 and Abrams X is insane, they both are pushing human capabilities by employing the most modern tech out there, although a lot of it may not work due to just how new and innovative these new design concepts are
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:25:28 not what I said, both are extremely engineered and are a proof of concept rather than yet another small innovation
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:43 fair ig
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:27:38 but to sum it up, they aren’t the most reliable due to their ground breaking tech
the-dump 2023-06-11 10:58:03 fair, maybe a few will be used but you’re probably right when you say that it’s gonna be nearly nonexistent on the battlefield when/if they make a working one
the-dump 2023-06-11 12:29:26 true
the-dump 2023-06-17 19:40:22 cpu destroyer
