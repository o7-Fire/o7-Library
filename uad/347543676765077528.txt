general 2020-11-26 03:04:58 Why people complain about shredder bugs
general 2020-11-26 03:05:03 They aren’t that annoying tbh
general 2020-11-26 03:05:15 ?
general 2020-11-26 03:05:24 Wut?
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 03:06:27 I should make a shredder but instead of cutters use guns and rockets so basically turn a f16 into a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 03:06:42 Fight shredder bugs with shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 03:07:20 People who build turrets than turn on isolation mode are more scummy than shredder bug spammers
general 2020-11-26 03:08:56 I modified a shredder bug into a dive carpet bomber
general 2020-11-26 03:09:04 No cutter on it
general 2020-11-26 03:09:09 Just bombs rockets and guns
general 2020-11-26 03:09:21 Also build a frame for it so it looks like a b 52 that broke its neck
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:15:20 shredder bug users r so dum
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:15:26 they always like make 20 of the bugs
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:15:30 and they always have bad pc
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 19:15:35 so the bugs end up moving so slow

creations-chat 2021-04-17 01:23:13 <@456226577798135808> isnt your gun thing legit just a classic spinning barrel anti air gun but with the spinner set to a lower speed?
creations-chat 2021-04-17 01:25:17 Its literally the most basic gun spam turret but with a stick where the guns should be
creations-chat 2021-04-17 01:29:42 “i built”  my man im pretty sure that basically every noob in pvp with a turret has that rotating gun design and whats the point of a rotating barrel in the first place
