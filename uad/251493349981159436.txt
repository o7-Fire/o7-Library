The Tale of endyrm (251493349981159436)
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:19:18 ok I am here
general 2018-11-08 22:19:24 hi flame
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:20:53 so I read rules
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:21:06 pretty much the same as other servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:21:09 easy to follow
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:21:17 shouldn't have issues
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:21:24 great! :p
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:22:21 same
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:22:57 oof I made an uber fast speed boat that works on both sides
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:23:44 I have to show the design for you guys to understand it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 22:27:43 Super simple speed boat
creations-chat 2018-11-08 22:28:01 
creations-chat 2018-11-08 22:28:29 its SUPER fast
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:38:30 why is there not a rank that you can get for making a water creation that can go over 400sps in the water
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:55:37 game machine broke
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:56:48 I was just messing arround with a parachute
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:57:00 then spawned my boat in
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:57:04 started moving
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:57:11 and boom I was in the sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:58:36 but someone said I can get a rank for that.. what rank in specific
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:59:32 woah thats much faster
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 22:59:37 did you do the same thing as me
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:00:34 ok fine I will try getting that speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:01:33 LOL
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:01:58 I got the rare rocket sounds at the same time
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:02:05 so that makes it uber rare
creations-chat 2018-11-08 23:03:09 hey I found much higher than orbital velocity
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:04:04 
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:04:18 wow its so easy
creations-chat 2018-11-08 23:05:14 yeah its quite a cool thing. requesting for orbital velocity role. -CreepTheF0x
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:12:30 gonna try beating it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 23:28:09 HOW ABOUT THIS FOR ORBITAL RANK! -CreepTheF0x
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:28:30 guys I all beat you
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:28:32 
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:34:11 <@354336251551285251>
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:34:31 good luck beating that
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:34:32 LOL
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:34:50 no
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:34:57 its parachute glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:35:22 and apparently that number you saw is roughly 230 trillion
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:36:19 baydren go in the vip server at the top of the vip server list
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:36:36 oh lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:36:42 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:36:46 you are not in it
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:36:55 **wrong server my dude**
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:37:28 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:37:29 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:39:20 <@!264769733021270016> making 2 propellers that go in each direction seems easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:39:35 if you want a reference, check out my gyroscope
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:39:52 yeah but it can be simplified
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:40:05 I wanted to make a literal concept of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:40:20 yeah I wouldn't mind that
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:50:12 yeah they should
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:50:22 its physics
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:50:37 how do you think helicopters work
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:01:54 14
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:01 on the e+
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:21 I got 2.something e+30 or something like that
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:23 
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:29 wat
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:32 different
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:36 I thought it was 30
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:39 well its 14
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:02:47 ok he beat me
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:03:35 but I will beat him back
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:03:51 library computers, my dude
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:05:52 
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:05:59 yes I know
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:06:11 no computer for home lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:06:15 I know magma
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:06:57 no
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:07:07 not one that fits for my gaming needs
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:07:37 no not just roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:07:46 I bought a game in 2016
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:07:51 called Scrap Mechanic
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:08:01 and I can't play it on any computer
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:08:04 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:10:53 my paddles are orbiting my boat
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:11:22 rare sight of a boat being orbited by his paddles
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:13:16 ree
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:13:24 I must be faster
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:22:11 nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:33:58 trying so hard rn
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:34:03 still no luck
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:34:11 with beating the other guy
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:35:14 try processing this one I did a while ago https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/510234111105826829/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:38:56 aw so close
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:44:47 I give up
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:44:56 I'll hold the second fast speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:06:05 <@!322963697788125184> I saw your message with going at 60k speed, but did you know I went much faster?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:07:30 because its in a vip server with the new update
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:07:41 or if its vip server only stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:00 idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:04 didn't test rockets
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:10 only tried getting speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:16 none rn
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:24 that screenshot was from yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:44 **on a library computer because my home pc is trash**
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:08:55 omg
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:09:07 they don't allow "reeee"
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 13:09:17 ;c
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:00:36 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:01:56 I want the light speed role, I hold probably the third or fourth fastest speed record in plane crazy..
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:02:38 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/300082739812630531/510236619660460062/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:03:48 I imagine so.
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:03:49 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:04:37 I saw someone get something.somethingsomething**e+16**
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:04:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:05:13 and someone got 8.somethingsomething**e+14**
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:05:30 I hold the third fastest speed then
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:05:48 **now give me my well awarded rank**
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:06:25 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:06:26 is
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:06:30 folding fuselages
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:06:53 no
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:07:08 not ready to build them yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:07:14 oof magnets are easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:07:40 I think I also found a way to make an infinitely accelerating magnet engine
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:08:22 yeah it seems simple
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:10:47 please not a bot
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:11:02 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:11:06 wait arround a minute
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:11:10 then join
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:14:56 ree I don't exactly know the controls by heart, flame
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:15:17 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:18:33 I am not in the game yet e.e
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:18:43 not at the library either
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:33:51 *Several people are typing...*
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:34:55 what does the inventor role have to do with being a good person?!
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:36:42 hm lets see
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:36:48 <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:42:17 no you only keep the highest one
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:42:26 also how do YOU do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:42:44 thought so
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:42:58 I used a parachute glitch
general 2018-11-09 21:44:41 bigsmoke
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:45:27 yeah I easely get there using the parachute glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:46:00 let me guess
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:46:18 magnet engine?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:46:33 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:47:15 generating momentum infinitely
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:47:21 thats how
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:47:36 no idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:05:23 roblox installation is super slow rn..
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:06:15 yeah I am one of the fastest people out there
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:06:29 and I might try beating inferno
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:09:07 yeah I am experiencing the slow roblox stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:09:17 its taking a while to install roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:36:15 nice helicopter with propellor power
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:22:42 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:23:19 I was still not given my light speed rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:23:48 yet I got over 2.30somethingsomething**e+14**
creations-chat 2018-11-10 17:40:38 repost, requesting for light speed rank
creations-chat 2018-11-10 17:41:17 ~CreepTheF0x
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:41:58 ,_,
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 17:42:08 that was from a few days ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:03:45 question
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:03:59 does a helicopter count as a VTOL
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:04:18 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:04:24 sad
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:04:40 sad I made this cool thing yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:05:24 fine, but probably not today because I am busy
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:11:13 yeah I tried looking it up on google, I still don't have an answer about a helicopter being a vtol
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:13:49 still not sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:17:46 I'll ping the guy that made the ranks and ask him, since he might know more than I do about what qualifies as a vtol or not
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:18:47 <@!252094891448860673> sorry for the ping, but what counts as a vtol exactly? (more specifically, does a helicopter count as one?)
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:19:03 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:19:07 hi moderator
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:19:46 a helicopter does that, but the people I ask don't seem to know if a helicopter counts as one
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:19:59 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:20:02 good
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:20:30 yeah this is an obvious vtol
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:20:37 but this is my creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:20:55 oh god
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:20:59 I will try
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:21:11 streamable
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:21:32 okay
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:22:59 so now I will try to not crash this trashcan of a computer while recording
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:31:23 so I made a propellor-powered only helicopter, this is the block count.
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:31:38 and this is a video of me using it https://streamable.com/397d5
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:32:40 <@!333608434043715585> look closely on the main propellor
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:33:25 ree it did not send to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:34:04 ok sending with the original image
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:34:57 and this is an image of it in use. the link is a video of me using it: https://streamable.com/397d5
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:35:28 wew it finally sent it
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:36:35 <@456226577798135808> can I have my uber cool propellor master rank now?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:37:35 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:38:20 is it just a simplified version of the big thing I made, flame
creations-chat 2018-11-10 18:39:51 **i've made a helicopter that does vertical takeoff and landing using only propellors and I don't have the rank**
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:56:46 is this some literal gyro madness
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:57:49 I have no idea how to implement this on my heli design
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:01:18 tbh I think I am satisfied with my sort of concept of a helicopter
https://streamable.com/397d5
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:01:51 it got me my propellor master role, which I just realised that I was finally given it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:12:27 I was imediatly asked help with propellors, but I can't help when my computer is like a trashcan
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:13:25 make the bombs move like cruise missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:16 no I mean once they drop, they take a sec and then they start moving to the target
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:33 yea
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:39 would be interesting to see it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:55 **nice**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:15:40 yea
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:16:17 are you saying it spins uncontrollably?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:16:27 <@220562331606843394>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:17:10 a helicopter is considered a vtol
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:18:20 I might know a way for you to fix this..
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:18:57 I know how
https://streamable.com/397d5
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:19:06 I made one
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:19:09 just from testing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:19:56 because I was mainly trying to prove a way to counter torque
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:20:08 and it ended up making this successful thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:20:23 which I plan converting into a fully working helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:20:49 with it's sort of gyro that <@!264769733021270016> is telling me about
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:11 actually, show me a video of it trying to fly
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:17 I want to see what it does
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:21:22 k
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:21:37 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:22:13 oof
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:22:45 basically like my prototype heli
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:22:59 https://streamable.com/397d5
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:23:10 oops it might of sent in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:23 yeah I want to try and make a propellor only heli
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:39 no
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:24:41 no
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:25:04 the bottom rotor is to control foward and backward movement
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:26:31 oof can you explain how that gyro of yours works?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:27:02 well dm me it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:27:23 I really don't mind you copying my propellor design
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:27:27 it was a concept anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:27:34 **a concept that works**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:28:00 the middle rotor was to control foward and backwards movement
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:28:16 is it pitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:28:23 I think its pitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:29:36 but I think that with a modified swashplate to work with dual rotors, it would make the best helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:29:38 flame
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:29:41 its a concept
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:29:56 I still need to make the final design
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:30:27 I would really like doing some sort of team build on this
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:31:13 we gotta try though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:31:30 **we gotta try though**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:32:56 how about this, all 3 of us work on designs for that perfect helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:33:10 compare our stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:33:14 improve from there
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:33:32 good now we need to try and implement it in some swashplate
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:34:08 **we just have to try though**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:35:58 I want to try and make a design that could work on different types of helis
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:36:20 no idea, andrew
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:36:55 my idea is that they paint other blocks when you hit them onto others
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:36:59 but idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:38:02 oh thats actually cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:53:31 spawn at airport
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:55:18 yeah, problem is that motors only go at a defined speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:55:49 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:55:53 make a concept
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:56:13 k
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:58:57 omg stop spamming mentions
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:59:55 I would do a ?warn to both if I was mod, (but I can't be mod in more than 1 big server)
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:00:20 oof
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:00:48 why does that name sound familiar
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:21 **but sounds excesively RUSSIAN**
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:29 yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:02:40 I knew it was familiar
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:03:18 because you were consumed by despacido spider, <@!264769733021270016>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:03:29 **thats why you think it was a spider**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:03:40 lol ikr
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:05:55 lol

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:09:19 <@!294956031153405952> write a googolplex with your hand (not the simplified version which is 10 to the power of a googol)
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:12 REEE
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:30 barely able to speak
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:34 and use computer
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:49 <@168517341225811968> hi lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:52 xd
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:15:08 and flame, I obviously can't play rn
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:15:34 because trashtop sucks
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:15:50 I can tomorow though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:17:30 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:18:26 reee make a biplane that is propellor powered only
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:18:39 that would be super interesting imo
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:18:54 and I'll probably take on that challenge
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:19:11 again
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:19:19 write a googolplex
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:20:08 <@!294956031153405952> w r i t e  a  g o o g o l p l e x  b y  h a n d
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:20:19 thats an actual challenge.
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:21:04 ~~**because it will take you years before you can even get to 10% completion**~~
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:27:46 oh damn
creations-chat 2018-11-11 05:27:51 nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:41:33 I feel like I just got a great idea on how that propellor setup can work, but not sure if its practical.. but I guess I'll have to try tomorow, <@!264769733021270016>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:41:41 ok going to bed, bye guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:43:18 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:43:20 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:43:33 that can sorta be fixed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:45:22 make a second set of propellors, but make them move in the opposite direction, and reverse the way the blades are placed on the second set
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:47:16 idk, because I gtg and trashtop is about to crash
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:49:08 I can probably fix your issue tomorow, or in 9 hours from now (since its already tomorow (est timezone))
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:49:22 k bye
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:04:37 <@220562331606843394> sounds like it needs a gyro, and a torque remover
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:04:41 
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:05:12 flame said he knows a way to make some gyro
creations-chat 2018-11-11 15:05:24 I'll need to know what effects it has

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:24:50 <@!264769733021270016> getting somewhere with it
https://streamable.com/kbjgc
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:25:33 its a WIP propellor only powered heli
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:45:42 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:46:08 annoyed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:47:17 there is no ingame mods, dude
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:47:31 just saying that you are annoying me overall with that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:47:48 him
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:48:04 look at this..
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:48:41 yes but I just think he is annoying..
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:54:47 add this, devs
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:54:56 oops
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:54:58 x thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:55:29 fixed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 19:55:38 now I used the proper reaction
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:12:38 this is the engine alone, not sure if it is practical
 https://streamable.com/2wuth
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:12:58 maybe I should extend the gyro blades
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:20:41 https://streamable.com/taei1
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:21:08 motors should have more force when resetting
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:53:31 what, we shouldn't even be able to use rockets in normal game
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:53:39 so I am using it while I can
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:09 you can spawn at other places
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:23 its just an extra challenge imo
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:50 I gtg for now
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:51 brb
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:11:21 wait can I understand why using rockets to destroy people's builds that have spawned is considered trolling?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:57 but wait, why are you even able to use weapons in the normal version when arena mode should be the only place to use weapons
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:13:29 then they should do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:13:57 then do a server shutdown
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:14:43 can you please call me "Creep" instead while we are at it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:15:04 because thats the name I am used to be called by
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:15:52 yeah I don't consider it an insult
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:08 because its pretty much my name on the internet
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:26 I know, james
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:43 I am not an idiot
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:55 **I know you didn't say I was**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:01 **but it sounds like it**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:25 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:48 <@!295568493166985218> heres an example of me using the name "creep" on the WFYB server
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:21:56 oh and just to prove it, WFYB server has arround 1300 members
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:13 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:22 I just saw james's message
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:28 I'll leave it as it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:35 but this is a community discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:26:01 punishments ingame should not be tied to this server's punishments
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:26:24 <@!474930986275176448> yes, scrap mechanic is one of them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:26:30 but thats not on roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:26:50 yeah I just wish I could play scrap mechanic
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:27:16 omg WFYB is actually dying rn because Quenty is not finalising the next update

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:29:19 removed embed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:29:41 its better if you play it instead of looking at images
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:29:54 not just UI
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:30:07 team management is also a thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:30:21 and its much less laggy
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:30:30 also its translated in other languages
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:30:34 WFYB is a game
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:31:21 bym is almost complete for FE
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:31:38 its not, but its getting there
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:32:52 btm?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:33:03 <:oof:503264155940421633>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:33:24 won
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:33:29 WoN
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:33:34 ween
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:33:46 :bad:
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:34:06 dab spelled backwards is bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:34:27 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:35:16 lol
general 2018-11-11 21:35:38 lol
general 2018-11-11 21:36:32 if they get too toxic, get some image proof and send it to me, I can get em beaned from WFYB
general 2018-11-11 21:36:46 oof
general 2018-11-11 21:37:11 same for WFYB
general 2018-11-11 21:37:31 game is 100% free when it comes to important game mechanics
general 2018-11-11 21:37:55 but there are some stuff that don't affect gameplay as much that cost money
general 2018-11-11 21:38:07 such as naming your boat
general 2018-11-11 21:38:28 able to spawn 5 boats instead of 1
general 2018-11-11 21:38:43 or having 120 stamina instead 100
general 2018-11-11 21:39:34 wfyb does the same
general 2018-11-11 21:39:44 but its not popular
general 2018-11-11 21:39:59 exactly
general 2018-11-11 21:40:50 its sad because prison life was on the front page until jailbreak was released
general 2018-11-11 21:41:31 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 12:57:56 I think I found an easy and compact way to do the propellor motor for my heli
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 13:00:08 instead of the big giant module that works half the time, I can use some mechanical plate to angle the entire propellor foward, backwards, to the sides and diagonal
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 13:00:31 I think pistons would do that nicely
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 13:02:27 if that system works, then it might qualify for inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:14:08 wow slow mode
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:14:25 I hope that gets turned off later
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:14:42 deppends
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:15:54 fine but it should be <#497142796961054721> because its not in relation with Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:16:20 I know, lol
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:16:38 just saying slowmode is annoying sometimes
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:17:05 but I understand the use of it rn
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:17:27 so, 👍 for the great use of it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:18:14 AI?, but the game doesn't even have proper logic yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:21:53 temporarily or permanently?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:23:08 oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:23:41 oof

plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:37:30 no updates is the first reason in WFYB
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 21:38:22 second reason is the unreasonable amount of skids using an instakill script

plane-crazy 2018-12-20 17:10:36 and it is completely useless tbh

creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:32:29 First attempt at making the body of a helicopter while keeping the entire thing propellor-only.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:33:32 Uses also a propellor only tilt system.
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:34:10 hey the bot did not change my name
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:36:01 without the lights is kinda boring..
creations-chat 2019-02-05 00:37:27 btw if my discord nickname still shows up as "CreepTheF0x" in this server, please keep in mind my username on roblox has since changed to "5Creep".
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 23:01:18 <:thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 23:01:33 now how does that work
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 23:02:17 oof
general 2019-02-08 22:54:49 I am literally speechless

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:57:43 uh my controlls are not working
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:58:20 for my vehicle on slot 12
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:58:42 specially if they have motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:59:03 it won't respond at all
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:59:24 actually it only happens on my slot 12 vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:59:43 controlls work on my motor using train cart on slot 11
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:03:09 comic sans works better than that new font tbh
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:06:16 I am literally pissed off now
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:06:32 unable to use my helicopter I worked on for a while..
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:08:05 keybinds don't work.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:08:25 this is not ok.
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:09:21 new font is worst than comic sans tbh
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:10:56 I CAN'T EVEN FORCE ARIAL ON

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 23:13:59 beesmas was an unofficial event from 2017, pretty good even though glitchy
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:30:45 ping me when the bug gets fixed.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 23:30:48 please kthx
bug-reports 2019-02-09 00:30:00 its the keybinds
bug-reports 2019-02-09 00:30:08 all unresponsive to some builds
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:17:50 is the issue really the guns
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:23:28 holy crap the guns were the issue
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:32:16 the pvp guns on your creation seem to break everything
bug-reports 2019-02-09 18:32:39 I removed them all from my heli and it started working again
help 2019-02-09 20:51:07 imagine making a walker that has to swing it's weight foward to move
help 2019-02-09 20:51:27 in a motion that makes it jump
help 2019-02-09 21:10:36 someone did it in Scrap Mechanic
help 2019-02-09 21:10:54 knowing how both games are similar, it should be simple
help 2019-02-09 21:22:53 <@!385247005003218948> removing pvp guns from your creation seems to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 02:45:48 the motors are broken again?
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 02:45:53 oh boy
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 17:40:00 is this a droop snoot
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 17:40:15 
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 17:40:50 lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 17:42:13 nice
bug-reports 2019-02-24 22:50:27 looking at all the stuff with motors ended up giving me an idea
bug-reports 2019-02-24 22:52:00 *if only motors worked like bearings, keybinds making super complicated logic like in scrap mechanic, it would be possible*
help 2019-02-24 22:55:09 *Owned by Arcus_DemoniumAlt*
help 2019-02-24 22:55:18 gonna be sure to avoid him now
creations-chat 2019-02-24 22:57:48 if you take the size of a classic noob (that has no accessories whatsoever and on R6), the height of the noob would be 25cm
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:00:39 since a classic noob is 5 studs tall
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:00:58 (1 stud = 5cm)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:01:35 (which means a block in plane crazy is 10cm x 10cm x 10cm)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:07:40 wait its 2.5 studs?
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:17 the legs of the classic noob is 1 stud thick
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:26 so if there are 2 legs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:08:33 it means 2 studs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:35 hm
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:38 odd
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:09:45 always thought it was 2 studs
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:10:47 (which would be true if madattak or rickje changed the character sizes down to 4 studs)
creations-chat 2019-02-24 23:11:14 yeah
help 2019-02-24 23:45:03 anybody can draw
help 2019-02-24 23:45:06 anybody can build
help 2019-02-24 23:45:30 you work hard on building
help 2019-02-24 23:45:36 you also work hard on drawing
help 2019-02-24 23:46:04 copying creations is just not ok
help 2019-02-24 23:46:16 neither is copying art
help 2019-02-24 23:47:25 I can just imagine how bad my 12 year old sister would feel if someone stole the pfp she made for me and say that they made it
help 2019-02-24 23:48:14 trust me I would kick the first person to do that to her off the internet pretty rapidly
help 2019-02-24 23:48:43 now back to the plane crazy part
help 2019-02-24 23:49:14 imagine how bad you would feel is someone blatantly stole your creation and said he made it
help 2019-02-24 23:50:06 its someone copying entirely someone else's build
help 2019-02-24 23:50:20 not if you're skilled
help 2019-02-24 23:50:24 at the game
help 2019-02-24 23:50:32 but not at aesthetics
help 2019-02-24 23:50:46 if you are skilled enough, you can do anything
help 2019-02-24 23:51:23 I do a bit of both
help 2019-02-24 23:51:48 I made this small "hovercraft" that works great for pvp
help 2019-02-24 23:52:22 actually I never tested if they explode in water
help 2019-02-24 23:52:33 thats odd
help 2019-02-24 23:52:40 oof
help 2019-02-24 23:54:46 if plane crazy had the same logic system as scrap mechanic, I would be able to create one of the most complicated systems for a magnet hovercraft ever
help 2019-02-24 23:56:58 yeah motors need to be fixed. period.
help 2019-02-25 00:25:27 whats wrong with motors as a barrel
help 2019-02-25 00:25:59 if you are making something small, then its your only choice
help 2019-02-25 00:26:28 personally it changes nothing
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 23:37:44 when will rick delete plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 23:37:53 **never I hope**

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 23:12:51 how, from a ping or just simply DM'ing
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 23:13:16 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 23:15:21 <@!163143541160148992> ok sorry for the ping but there is this guy in my server that first tried crashing the server and is now building hate symbols and text, I suppose you might be able to get ahold of rick to get him banned as he claims to be an alt that was previously banned.

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:17 why was I legit ghostpinged
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:31 rip xp, my favorite OS
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:13 I wasn't in charge of the perm thing
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:20 I ended up fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:48:55 probably because I do have experience in a server with nearly 2k members
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:51:29 muted role thing is something that I've had trouble with in the past
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:53:58 he actually promoted me because I was a friend
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:36 I only go there when people need me
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:41 to fix stuff
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:54:50 because I am busy with WFYB discord and game
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:55:12 WFYB has a werewolf crate crisis
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:55:20 and it's about to get patched
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:56:00 just waiting for Devon to fix it completely and get Quenty to push the patch
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:56:26 yeah, WFYB has a new dev now updates will happen more often
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 22:58:02 I've made an airship that abuses werewolf crate abilities (stabiliser, not the infinite climb thing)
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:01 cannon spammers are annoying, I agree
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:09 they should be nerfed, I agree
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:34 but that's currently not the highest priority to fix
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:00:55 **the economy** needs to be rebuilt
general 2019-10-16 22:24:16 helicopter arms in WFYB open beta, and I was able to do this scary image

plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:34 I saw
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:34:53 I didn't even do anything wrong so banning me would be abuse
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:35:35 <@!294956031153405952> you got to at least have a little sense of humor if you don't want to sound like a robot lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:37:02 it's also pretty funny to see lilundr act completely different here than in WFYB discord
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:37:48 <@456226577798135808> not as obnoxious (how do you even spell that word)
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:40:00 it's interesting how this is a chatroom for plane crazy stuff however it's used like <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:40:56 I put that last trick question to stop people from just skimming through the application without caring
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:41:25 similar trick used on the WFYB staff application
plane-crazy 2019-12-07 02:41:55 <@!249373398612967441> some servers pay their moderators

general 2021-09-20 05:06:21 alright, time for me to recruit more devs to ask Quenty in-person how many frogs I am at RDC2021
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 19:14:47 idk, ask Quenty

plane-crazy 2021-09-20 19:33:26 I keep asking him how many frogs I am but he refuses to tell me :(
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 19:53:36 at least he paid me for my work on the recent update in wfyb
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 19:53:52 still having existential crisis from not knowing how many frogs I am :(((

general 2021-10-08 03:51:57 if the video gets deleted then it's probably because the mods are deleting it (unless suprim is deleting them himself)
general 2021-10-08 03:52:34 you probably should stop posting them then
general 2021-10-08 03:52:48 because they'll probs actually give you punishment instead of just deleting
general 2021-10-08 03:53:47 ironic
