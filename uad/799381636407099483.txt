plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:15:23 I can't be the first
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:16:33 What am I looking at?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:18:41 I can't think of a single plane I could make
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:19:46 I already tried
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:19:59 Way to complex for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:20:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:20:40 I got part of the fuselage done
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:20:51 And a small bit of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:21:01 Along with the nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:21:57 It's probably basic enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:23:22 I have yet to build a working helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:25:33 Any specific variant?

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:28:31 Leave and switch server
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 05:28:46 Not many things you can do
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:41:00 I've been thinking of doing the xf-105
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:41:31 is there any way to angle wing tips down without motors?

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:44:33 gotta be kidding me
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:45:03 I swear
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:45:48 why do most donators act like dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:46:14 half the ones I come across in pc act like literal children
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:47:10 f-4 and su-25?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:47:36 shut the fuck up about the gripen
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:48:12 all Western European planes look the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:48:18 you can't change my mind
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:49:00 what were you doing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:49:22 funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:50:27 why so you guys like the gripen so much?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:51:04 of fucking course you're Swedish
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:52:04 I can't tell the difference between the eurofighter and gripen
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:52:23 they use the exact same wing config and everything
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:52:26 canards
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:52:44 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:52:48 I like bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:53:33 they even have the same air intake position
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:53:46 I think they
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:54:09 I haven't seen the euro fighter or the gripen in ages
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:54:36 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:55:07 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:55:15 not even close to what I said
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:55:51 somebody is upset that I insulted their country's aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 04:58:44 ok?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:01:07 it has to be unstable as hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:01:23 no way that thing files without shaking apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:02:08 how could that thing even fly that fast?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:03:11 I get that speed with like 6 hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:03:31 I don't see how a couple super rockets could push that thing past 400
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:04:05 I've seen 25 hover engines before
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:04:09 and went like 200
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:04:28 it was a slightly heavy build
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:04:56 who asked
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:05:21 I still don't have one
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:14 do aerodynamics even matter in game?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:29 explains a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:49 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:55 stuff like drag
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:07:03 not lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:07:44 then my flying train is a good idea irl
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:09:37 welp

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:06:18 
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:06:32 working on a flying runway
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:07:05 the nets are there just to make landing easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:11:22 it's anchored
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:12:02 this whole thing is unrealistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:12:16 I don't really care
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:12:47 the props are temp anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:13:05 I was just testing if a aircraft can land on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:14:39 I'm having some balance issues
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:05:45 do you have anymore angles of this?
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:09:44 who the hell did this guy piss off to get so many downvotes?
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:18:46 I don't think I've seen so much bitching in a discord server ever
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:21:10 keep crying
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:24:33 it kind of looks like a stealthy version of a f-15
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:26:39 it reminds me of the yukikaze novel version of the ffr 31
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:28:22 do they have any planes on remaking the map?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:28:27 or at least making it bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:30:13 I just want to have a fast boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:30:21 /and not run out of water within 15 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:30:34 or fly at mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:30:42 /and not run out of ground to look at
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:30:54 /within a fraction of a second
creations-chat 2021-08-11 00:31:05 .joe amma
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:31:46 it's how I've gotten used to typing
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:31:59 /I can't not hit / when needing to type
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 00:34:14 what was he doing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:49:09 maybe someday they'll make the plot size bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:49:49 maybe get rid of the base and have each plot be disconnected
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:50:59 maybe they should remake the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:51:12 and have it be bigger then 50 feet
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:51:34 what a photorealistic plane crazy build
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:51:43 impressive
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:52:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:52:56 thank god somebody else had thought of this
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:53:28 the ones in the photo look like mini f-16s
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:53:54 could just make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:55:15 NJ
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:56:00 they just look like delta wing f-16's
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:56:26 tailess delta wing f-16's
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 02:03:35 Motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 02:04:03 what does you plane look like?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:44:14 does anybody have any idea on how to do thrust vectoring?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:44:39 I've done it before
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:44:51 I have to bring the motor back down
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:45:22 or else I'll do multiple backflips within a second
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:46:07 why is it taking so long for discord to send messages
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:46:53 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:47:14 last time I used motor 1
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:47:19 and it kinda worked
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:49:01 I've been thinking of making the X-44
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:49:12 and If I remember correctly
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:49:27 it only uses thrust vectoring to maneuver
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:50:14 the what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 03:50:53 what the hell is a splituaion?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 00:38:08 nearly finished up my fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 00:38:13 
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 00:38:19 just need to add weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 00:38:28 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 00:40:06 pretty far off
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:09:38 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:11:44 are you gonna elaborate?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:12:53 proof?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:13:39 your joke wasn't funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:13:48 it didn't even make sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 16:17:56 what would be the point?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 18:19:01 
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 18:19:02 
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 18:19:14 reworking my biplane fighter design
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 18:20:21 it's a bit slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 18:20:41 but it has pretty good roll speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:52:25 
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:52:43 I was working on a mirco bi plane for a blimp
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:52:53 I think I went just a bit overboard with the semi futuristic design
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:53:33 I don't know where to put the camera
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:56:13 I might add jets and get rid of the props
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:57:19 it's also has a pusher prop
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:02:21 
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:02:35 does it look better with different props?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:06:09 gonna scrap it
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:06:47 I'm in window mode
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:08:57 search it up
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:09:10 how do you not know this?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:09:22 how long have you been using a computer?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:10:53 do you see that square at the top right of you screen?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 02:11:00 it's left to the x
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:03:42 
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:04:08 does anybody know what that weird line on the bottom is for?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:04:14 it's at the front of the air intake
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:05:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:06:18 I've come across drawings of that thing pushed out while landing/taking off vertically
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:06:36 it has to have some use
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:07:01 shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:07:13 what are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:07:45 he already said that
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:08:20 I still don't know how the x-32 takes off vertically
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:08:58 stop talking
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:09:36 I'm losing braincells rapidly reading the shit you type
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:09:55 why furrys exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:10:07 I'm not joking
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:10:19 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:11:13 I'm planning on making a x-32a
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:11:32 since I've yet to see anybody make a good looking x-32
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:12:15 dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:12:18 shut up
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:12:56 ok

creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:33:34 the island sucks
creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:37:21 he only pinged him once, he edited the first message adding pur
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 23:42:32 ragdoll and hit shift
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:47:25 does anybody know where I should put the island?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:47:44 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:48:16 how long does it take for your plane to slow down?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:48:47 then it can land on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:49:07 it's long enough for a small plane to land it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:49:09 /that's the point
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:49:59 I'm starting to regret adding the ramp
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:50:14 it looks like ass
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:51:37 /did they say anything else?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:51:55 did they give a reason?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:52:23 it's not a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:59:11 
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:59:22 finished up my floating runway
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:59:33 I wasted 2 hours on this
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:59:43 it looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:00:23 I think so
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 01:08:59 forgot to post the second picture
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:53:00 
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:53:31 looks like ass
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:53:34 /but controls well
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:53:49 it uses motors to pitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:54:29 I have yet to figure out how roll without using normal control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:55:06 what did you try to post?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:55:25 looks good
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:01:05 I just needed the link

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:01:38 messed up something
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:01:44 might be the weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:01:49 at least it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:56:44 do pusher prop aircraft control different?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:56:59 I'm talking about pusher props on the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:59:01 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:48:17 thurst vectoring props
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:48:19 /did it for the joke
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:48:23 I swear
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:50:06 no shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:54:10 the front prop can point backwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:54:31 kind of useful for landing
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:57:55 nobody is laughing
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:59:28 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:59:43 wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:59:52 aren't those the exact same thing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 19:59:57 /airships and blimps
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:00:15 what about zeppelins?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:01:27 but it's still a type of blimp

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:31:03 gonna try and make a mini plane as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:32:47 why are they adding infinite terrain
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:33:25 why not just make a map optimized for planes and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:33:36 might take longer
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:33:51 I know
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:33:58 I know
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:34:12 that's why I said "and sutff"
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:34:54 I want smaller rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:17 maybe add rocket pods
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:44 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:35:50 rocket pods look cooler
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:36:22 add ramjets
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:38:34 I'm still working on that plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:39:03 I don't see the point
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:40:10 have the engine be powered by the guns recoil
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:40:19 I'm a tech genius
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:41:03 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:41:16 I wonder if they'll change the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:41:21 or just keep it the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:05 
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:17 this is gonna be a pain to copy
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:41 end my suffering
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:42:46 please
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:43:06 I think materials kind of count
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:43:28 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:46:21 god damn it
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:46:50 found the problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:47:00 should be a easy fix
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:47:25 I used the wrong delta surface on the middle part
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:47:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:48:16 I want to make a accurate adf-01 cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:49:41 update?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:50:08 thought it was gonna be a different game
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:53:36 
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:53:47 I had to redo the left wing twice
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 22:55:07 gotta be kidding me
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:11:41 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:23:29 <@!619312093962829849>
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:23:32 almost done
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:24:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:24:48 I've just tested the drone
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:25:20 not very well
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:25:29 /the thing is like 5 block wide
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:25:40 it's very sensitive
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:26:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:27:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:27:51 it flys
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:28:07 I just didn't map the control surfaces to my keyboard
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:28:30 I have yet to figure out how to make the nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:29:14 oh no
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:29:34 I just don't know how to make any aircraft nose at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:29:38 /I've tried before
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:30:28 
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:30:33 they don't end up well
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:31:10 I don't know how I even did this
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:31:42 gonna try and copy a c-130 nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:34:32 plane crazy is nearly a decade old
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:35:01 plane crazy 2 is probably gonna look a lot different
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:36:18 I kind of like it
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:36:36 shut the hell up
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:36:53 say 911 one more time
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:37:02 and I'll break your knee caps
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:40:49 shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 23:43:26 how big should the plot be?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:33:25 I hate a grammar
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:33:34 i hate

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:38:35 I swear
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:38:46 every time I join there's like 50 hackers
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:39:08 sometimes it's fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:39:16 but other times it's :kill all
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:40:58 I once tried to put a sam on my aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:41:01 it was not epic
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:41:23 it was epic
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:41:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:42:07 have you ever heard of the VVP-6?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:43:07 anime pfp
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:43:10 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:43:57 I've never seen such a dead chat
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:57:20 what the hell is a p100?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:46:16 are lifting body aircraft possible?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:47:34 what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:48:03 what's the problem here?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:48:55 have none of you heard of a lifting body fuselage?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:50:24 it's a aircraft that uses a special fuselage design to gain lift instead of using wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:50:42 the f-15's fuselage is a lifting body
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:50:50 though it also uses wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:52:11 I'm surprised none of you heard of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:52:21 I didn't think it was that obscure
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:53:02 give me a sec
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:53:25 I think they used a ramp so it could take off
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:53:34 the ramp was for spacecraft or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:53:47 funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:54:02 yup
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:54:12 it was designed to never land
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:55:10 it doesn't land
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:55:16 they repair mid air
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:55:35 I don't know how that works
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:55:51 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:56:01 /fixing aircraft a mile long aircraft while it's sitll in the air
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:56:18 even for ace combat it's a bit insane
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:01:17 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:01:30 only took a decade to find the image
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:01:48 I confused it with another ramp
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:03:40 can't wait for bigger plot sizes
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:04:06 I can make a 1:1 scale cl1201
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:04:41 double flying aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:04:49 sounds like hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:05:39 I hope the planes have better physics
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:06:13 maybe players might learn how to land
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:06:55 sounds great
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:07:11 actual usable aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:08:15 dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:08:21 the amount of folds that would need
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:08:40 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:09:38 you would have to make it a vtol as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:09:43 I don't know how
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:10:05 how do you plan on taking off?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:10:20 a seaplane?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:10:23 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:10:28 why?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:10:51 do you know how many pontoons you would need?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:11:10 the whole thing would need to be made out of them
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:11:46 just another scale imagine of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:11:48 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:12:03 747's would dock to it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:12:37 I don't know anything about airliners
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:12:48 if I can' t pull a cobra with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:12:51 then it isn't good
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:13:38 I think it would stay in the sky for like a month
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:14:32 I can't remember what the cl-1201 would be armed with
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:14:50 it was like lasers or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:15:29 I doubt any plane crazy user could land on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:15:52 that nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:15:59 reminds me of the su-34
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:16:17 how do planes land on it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:16:28 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:16:38 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:16:39 /found the runway
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:16:52 it reminds me of the blimp aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:17:32 would planes on it or would you just use drones?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:18:12 a pilot goes down with his aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:19:09 imagine a plane crazy user trying to """land""" on this
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:19:23 what the hell was that forward swept wing that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:19:53 I can't even make forward swept wing's look good on any of my planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:21:02 one of the most generic looking aircraft I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:21:46 what plane?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:22:16 I hope they add auto pilot
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:22:39 I can't imagine somebody trying to land on that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:22:56 when the aircraft would be moving around
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:24:12 just stop the plane rolling or yawing
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:24:15 sounds simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:24:54 how?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:25:57 I hope they make seats weightless
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:26:28 so you can make a interior that won't mess up the plane balance
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:26:43 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:31:52 I can't control it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:32:14 god damn it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:32:37 I've done that before
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:32:44 it controls like hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:32:49 still works somehow
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:33:05 I wonder if they'll fix that in plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:33:39 good
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:34:10 that means I can make the hopeless diamond in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:37:51 working a lot better with wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:40:36 I think so
creations-chat 2021-09-04 05:18:47 @exatlat holy shit, if you're gonna edit a photo at least make it look good
I can't @ for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:23:23 yo buddy, want a ride?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:24:04 no, no I don't
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:25:17 I hate when people just walk near my plane, stop, and then leave without saying anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:26:37 understandable
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:27:56 Joe mama
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:29:33 what do I do when
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:30:32 99% percent of the time somebody is playing music
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:30:44 it's always fnf music
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:31:21 soveit Russia funni
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:31:46 cyka blayt comrades
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:32:37 I don't have robux
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:32:46 and I never will
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:33:14 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:33:22 I just don't want them
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:34:00 got any pics of it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:34:45 imagine sleeping
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:34:48 weak
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:35:52 I have permanently damaged my brain from lack of sleep
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:36:36 does anybody actually want to sleep?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:36:46 it's a waste of time
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:37:46 oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:38:01 we have the same time zone
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:38:28 is that fucking astolfo
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:38:47 based
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:39:05 I didn't think I actually spelled that right
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:39:59 the second I see pink hair my first thought is astolfo
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:40:20 I can't un see it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:41:00 epic
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:41:31 if it's short then it's my first thought
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:41:54 I just realized
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:42:30 I have yet to make a original functioning build in almost a month
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:43:05 I've been doing the same idea over and over again for the last 2 weeks
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:43:33 it's not even a good build
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:43:37 it's just a triangle
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:43:49 that flys
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:44:39 it's just wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:44:53 but with wing panels in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:45:02 and control surfaces at the back
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:45:23 they control really weirdly
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:45:52 see ya
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:46:30 that sounds like a headache to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:47:37 what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:48:03 are you asking for ideas or?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:48:15 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:49:52 that's a
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:49:56 interesting idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:59:54 is he attacking people with it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:00:08 kill him
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:00:18 leave no trace
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:00:52 sad
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:01:00 you should've bullied him
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:01:46 pacifism is for the weak
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:02:07 who?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:02:31 why is everybody talking about the f-100 all of the sudden?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:02:42 funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:03:15 what generation is the f-100?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:03:21 2nd or 3rd gen?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:03:40 comedic
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:05:52 I can't search it up without car results
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:06:08 I don't know what a ford f100 even is
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:08:17 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:10:47 does anybody got any interesting jet ideas that nobody has done yet?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:11:04 I haven't had a original build thought in a month
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:11:52 does anybody have a interesting jet idea that isn't the su-11?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:12:06 bootleg mig 21
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:12:37 surprised nobody has done that yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:13:58 Google is showing me a completely different aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:14:10 what even is that
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:15:11 early Sukhoi looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:16:05 half their catalog was knock off migs
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:16:47 modern Sukhoi is pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:17:12 su-47 is the perfect plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:17:24 visually
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:17:57 it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:18:31 after I do the f-86
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:19:20 I should do the forward swept wing mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:20:21 that was a real model
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:20:42 give me a second to find it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:20:59 forward swept wing mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:21:03 you can't stop me
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:22:36 
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:22:39 fuck you
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:22:49 it took a decade to find that image
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:23:14 it really is
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:23:40 forward swept wings would've made it worse
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:24:00 I don't think it would've been flyable
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:24:24 for carrier shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:24:45 forward swept wings are badass
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:03 but they are also just use less
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:21 if I remember correctly
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:40 if the su-47 would've been put into production
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:58 they would've had to replace the wing after only a couple of flights
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:26:52 the wings would crack within a couple of flights
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:28:00 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:30:02 I'm surprised by the lack of yukikaze builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:33:26 starting to think a s-32 might be a cool build if the f-86 doesn't turn out well
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:34:13 just a more stealthy su-47
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:34:49 does also have some weird thrust vectoring nozzles
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:36:45 what's with camera?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:36:59 it's making me feel sick
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:37:48 does it move with your mouse?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:41:01 how do I even make this look good
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:41:14 no wonder why nobody has done the f-86
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:42:03 the proportions are my biggest worry
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:42:37 yup
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:43:36 I regret saying I'm gonna make it now
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:44:42 most early jets are just cylinders  with wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:46:15 I have the most trouble with making canopys
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:46:48 the rest is pretty easy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:47:54 what does max torque even do?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:50:00 most of the time I've messed with it I used it on pretty light stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:50:13 so I just couldn't tell a difference
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:53:01 camera still makes me feel nausea
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:53:23 I barely know how
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:54:32 I don't know how anybody makes helis
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:54:48 they look like a pain in the ass to make
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:54:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:55:55 I just realized that I almost never post my builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:56:55 didn't know the c-130 could do air to air refuelling
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:57:38 what can't the c-130 do?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:58:09 come on dude
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:58:28 don't give the Air force any ideas
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:58:52 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:59:04 I thought they were doing that to a 747?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:59:31 might be thinking of the wrong aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:00:02 yup
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:00:10 I was thinking of the Boeing YAL-1
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:00:52 maybe in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:01:23 you could stack a fuck ton of guns
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:01:41 could almost look like a laser
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:02:05 a railgun?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:02:23 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:03:47 maybe just make it really big
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:04:40 the lava spitter is like the only weapon that has sound effects
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:05:22 missiles need sound
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:05:37 and maybe trails as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:06:12 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:06:48 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:07:36 why would you need speakers for missiles?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:07:59 they would require incredible timing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:08:23 I'm just saying sounds for them launching
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:08:32 basic rocket noises
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:09:16 why did you bring up speakers then?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:10:12 I'm just talking about missiles having a white line of smoke coming from them
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:10:32 like irl rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:11:23 I don't think we're on the same level
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:13:34 I'm saying rockets (weapon) should have a firing sound and a smoke trail
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:14:07 just have a white line
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:14:17 cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:15:25 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:16:00 adfx-01
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:16:03 here I come
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:16:37 yo buddy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:17:24 this is what v2 was for
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:19:16 flamenco music gets louder
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:19:49 here's a good idea for pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:19:53 have blackout
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:20:15 fuck you
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:20:30 no more mach 5 180 maneuvers
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:21:02 if they make the lasers realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:21:18 they'll blind you the second you look at them
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:22:05 the adf-01 becomes useless
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:22:18 I don't know how you can even see the beam
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:22:48 iirc once a laser becomes powerful enough it becomes ""invisible""
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:23:12 I don't know how
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:23:26 I failed physics
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:24:10 I don't know how they plan on using lasers for 6th generation Aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:25:09 what build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:25:41 way behind my technical expertise
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:29:27 does anybody have any idea how to make forward swept wings?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:30:07 never mind
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:30:55 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:30:56 and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:31:30 got any pics?

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:46:22 it doesn't take long
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:46:55 looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:47:01 nose is a bit weird
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:47:50 how was your day?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:48:00 don't care
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:48:02 didn't ask

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:49:50 cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:49:56 but what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:50:28 do you guys want to hear a joke?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:50:36 the a-10 is a good plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:50:58 it's actual shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:51:31 it has almost no practical use anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:51:48 get owned a-10tards
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:52:43 probably
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:52:57 how?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:53:13 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:53:58 30mm isn't gonna do shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:54:53 modern tanks are a lot thicker now
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:55:18 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:55:28 I'm just talking out my ass
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:56:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:56:27 more practical then the a-10
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:57:01 still more practical
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:57:24 holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:57:33 nukes are a lot cheaper then I thought
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:02 I am
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:12 I have multiple mental illnesses
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:28 smiley
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:37 are you still taking this seriously?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:58:50 I was just doing a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 07:59:58 a mild amount of tomfoolery
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:00:30 about to destroy the a-10tards with facts and logic
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:02:06 now lets say hypothetical
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:03:42 now for the sake of the argument
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:04:39 I hate women
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:04:43 femboy are better
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:05:01 hella epic
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:05:14 I can roleplay my marriage in roblox now
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:05:42 snap back to
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:06:02 it's called we do a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:06:24 we do a light amount of trickery
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:06:34 looks better
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:07:01 I like the elevators
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:07:15 holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:07:25 that looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:07:49 why does it have 2 rotors?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:07:53 and a tail rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:08:37 but why still have a tail rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:09:19 when joe mama vented
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:09:53 what's the reference photo?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:10:04 that's a pusher prop
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:10:20 not a tail rotor
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:11:33 imagine not making functioning tandem rotors
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:11:37 pretty cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:12:29 I don't think it's possible
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:12:44 I'm pretty sure the helicopter is called raider x
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:12:50 or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:13:12 it's made by lockheed
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:14:07 I'm pretty sure it's for some new helicopter competition
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:14:39 they'll probably just keep using the Blackhawk though
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:15:13 it's the double rotor thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:15:17 you know
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:15:27 like the ka-50
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:15:47 never mind
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:16:22 tandem is the chinook type  rotor
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:17:11 coaxial rotor is the rotor I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:17:27 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:17:47 you can't
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:18:02 coaxial rotors don't actually work in pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:18:33 just try to hide props in the heli
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:19:40 how would a coaxial rotor work in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:20:08 I have the Wikipedia article opened right now
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:21:06 I may be illiterate but I can read the page
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:21:33 I have to leave
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:21:50 I'm so tried
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:22:10 my hand eye Coronation I'm has turned to shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:22:22 I can't type
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:22:23 bye
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:26:41 what's the deal with helicopter rotors?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:27:29 am I right or am I right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:28:07 way 😀
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:29:00 are helicopters even usefull in game?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:29:22 I don't see how they could be effective as a combat aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:29:38 they move so slowly
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:29:47 tracking them with a gun is pretty easy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:29:59 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:30:33 damn
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:30:44 that looks kinda cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:32:29 helicopters seem useless against anybody with a basic moveable turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:32:56 I've done it before
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:33:35 something like a low stall speed plane seems more useful
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:34:14 just slow down for a second launch a bomb or rocket
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:34:58 then just go full speed and run off
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:35:04 helicopters can't go fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:35:21 anybody with basic aim skills can hit it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:35:29 nice f-100
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:37:36 "flying wing nuclear submarine"
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:37:42 thanks for the idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:38:34 why not just post the images instead of putting a link?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:39:13 discord stops working the second I go to creations
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:39:28 my mobile device can't handle the memory
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:39:42 it's not pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:41:09 roblox crepyypasta at 3am
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:41:15 gone wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:41:39 so a normal pc plane?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:42:37 nothing happened on April 15 of 1989
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:43:32 I think it's both
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:44:11 I looked at Wikipedia for 5 seconds before making that joke
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:44:53 I'm gonna have to go
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:45:02 my grandfather just died from ligma
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:45:22 I need to attend his funeral
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:45:53 stop sucking
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:45:56 hoes mad
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:46:28 yo
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:46:41 do you guys think the su-41 could work?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:47:37 I'm still not 100% sure if this was a actual concept
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:48:53 forward swept swing wing aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:50:27 yo buddy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:50:31 wrong server
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:51:24 pardon me, dumbass?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:52:10 I think he might be mentally challenged
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:52:25 don't be rude, bush
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:52:36 he's just a bit slow
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:53:25 this isn't a argument
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:54:06 I don't think I've seen a ace combat aircraft like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:54:24 v3
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:55:07 never mind
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:55:18 I know what ace combat aircraft that is
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:55:32 it's very obviously the x-49
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:57:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:57:45 it's the alicorn
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 08:57:54 my favorite aircraft

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:04:40 Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:04:56 but expecting different results
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:08:42 communism = starvation
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:08:46 so it makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:09:03 I'm now starting to regret having the ben Shapiro pfp

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:15:06 it's also better looking
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:15:16 so it deserves the name super sabre
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:15:40 the sabre is just to small looking
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:16:46 the super sabre actually looks like it could gain lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:16:54 unlike the normal sabre
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:17:10 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:17:13 no I don't

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:19:01 my eyes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:19:30 that looks pretty small in comparison to other aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:19:36 even for a prop plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:20:55 how small did you think a plane was?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:20:57 a car?

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:25:25 I want everybody to feel my pain
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:25:32 also
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:25:47 that f-5 camo is hideous
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:26:07 there's so many better camo
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:26:19 ok and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:26:52 I don't know any more
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:27:07 I've been ironic for so long
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:27:19 I don't know who I am anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:29:57 
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:31:55 I expected better camo choice
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:32:20 I don't care if it served mostly in nam
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:32:39 god damn
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:32:47 I think Brazil used it more
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:33:15 wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:33:33 how did Russia even get a f-5 if they stopped using them in the war?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:34:14 did they just have f-5s laying around in the hangers?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:34:23 while still not using them
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:18 you just said that the f-5 wasn't used for that long in the Vietnam war
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:28 why would they still have them at air bases?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:52 America
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:37:28 but Russia had gotten a couple f-5s after the war ended
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:37:49 because the u.s still had some at abandoned air bases
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:38:42 I guess the south Vietnamese used them then
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:39:34 then how would Russia get a f-5?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:39:44 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:39:49 that hurts my eyes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:40:20 but how did the Vietnamese get the f-5?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:40:44 you just said they got them a decade later
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:42:10 Russia got the f-5s before that
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:42:19 thank god
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:42:45 bush is saying better then I am

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:48:00 about to test it
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:49:01 not sure where I'm gonna put the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:49:33 might try and make the canards and elevators functional.
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:57:38 wings are a bit long
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:57:59 the fuselage isn't supposed to look good
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:58:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:05:47 is that supposed to be a mil mi 24?

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:47:32 a f-22 with a viggen paintjob sounds even worse
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:47:59 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:48:06 it looks awful
creations-chat 2021-09-06 22:48:21 I didn't ask
creations-chat 2021-09-06 22:50:30 is that supposed to be a German version of the j7w shinden? just without the pusher prop
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:51:24 about to try and photoshop the viggen paintjob on the f-22

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:55:53 it's so hard trying to find a good image of the viggen livery
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:55:59 almost all of them are from the side
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 22:56:55 I can't find one for the viggen
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:00:47 I was photoshopping a real image of the f-22
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:00:52 using that isn't gonna help
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:01:11 dude
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:01:27 I don't think you understand what I'm doing

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:17:44 sure it did
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:18:07 I guess finding the colors would've been slightly hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:18:25 expert roles are jokes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:19:10 I've done pixelart
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:19:13 it doesn't take work
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:19:22 you know what
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:19:43 I might start doing more pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:19:50 I could get free expert
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:20:24 cope harder
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:21:11 I know

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:21:44 he really doesn't put effort into his builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:21:49 I was mostly joking
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:22:19 what a original idea

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:24:50 somebody give me a image that I can turn into pixelart
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:27:32 motorlocking 🤮
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:31:25 about to make pixelart
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:34:55 maybe a hour
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:35:10 if you're in a conversation with somebody
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:35:14 it doesn't take very long
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:36:31 <@!464634048279478282> how many blocks were in this build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:36:48 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:36:59 I think mine should be bigger
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:37:44 mine should be 2332
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:37:46 not fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:37:57 I might've messed up my math
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:38:31 my image is 53x44
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:39:05 it's just a heavily scaled image of a su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:39:40 how many blocks can a normal base hold?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:41:03 the base is 51-52 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:41:10 it is just a single block off
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:41:15 you have to be kidding me
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:42:34 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:43:08 you can just barely tell it is a su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:43:27 lmao

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:37:55 you mean fall?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:38:16 doesn't look like the UI-4053 Sphyrna to me
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:38:46 sphyrna is best
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:39:07 the agaion doesn't even look like it could fly
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:41:06 for you see I am many of grades ahead of you
which means by most countries standards that I am in fact smarter
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:43:07 what the hell did I say?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:43:32 furry ew
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:44:51 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:48:11 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:48:27 let's say I make a plane like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:48:38 would it control differently?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:52:27 is that neo warfare x?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:54:01 I forgot about that
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:54:09 loved how those things looked
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:54:42 I use keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:55:11 I've made a plane using the same config as the shinden
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:55:27 and I remember it controlling really weirdly
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:58:52 of what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 05:59:46 nevermind
creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:01:12 it really sucks neo warfare x is such a dumpster fire
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:01:30 send a pic
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:02:58 nice to know I'm not the only one who thought of rex
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:04:48 Joe mama
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:17:26 give it more contrast
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:17:53 and make the colors more saturated
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:18:17 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:19:03 just copy this
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:19:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:20:08 you messed up your capitalization

creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:29:30 did it work? 
edit: add another
creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:35:44 I like the muzzle brake
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:41:19 on school?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:42:00 my school can be as long as I want it to
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:42:12 I haven't done school work in almost a week
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:46:54 I'm doing online school
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:47:37 those brain lits can't keep me logged in for more then 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:48:00 I haven't be able to log in for nearly a week
creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:48:57 what tank is it supposed to be?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:49:18 I couldn't log in for the first week of school as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:49:46 they didn't even have a account ready yet
creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:52:21 that tank is pretty ugly
creations-chat 2021-09-07 06:54:29 t110
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:58:38 I just realized
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:58:57 why are there so many shitty looking su-27s
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:59:19 I don't think I've ever seen a good looking su-27 in pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:59:25 post a pic
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 06:59:58 sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:00:38 qaher-313?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:00:47 I thought you said planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:00:50 not toys
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:01:16 what's your level?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:01:53 post your su-27
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:02:45 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:03:02 pretty basic plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:03:34 fuck you
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:03:50 fuck you
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:04:50 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:05:24 have you even see a liver?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:05:41 Brown?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:05:54 are you color blind?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:06:21 do you mean orange?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:07:04 ah
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:07:26 you should see a doctor tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:07:36 your liver should not look like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:08:01 it's not saturated at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:08:13 just some fancy shading
creations-chat 2021-09-07 07:08:49 wish you luck
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:09:11 if you think the ffr-41 looks ugly
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:09:28 your probably are a schizophrenic
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:09:42 how?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:09:51 give me a solid reason how
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:10:05 what's complex about it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:10:21 in what way?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:10:36 shocker
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:10:49 futuristic plane does not look normal
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:11:05 never could've guessed
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:11:23 you don't know what scfi is
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:11:49 I'm about to beat some sc fi right into You
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:12:47 still more aerodynamic then the f-4
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:13:03 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:13:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:13:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:14:21 see
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:14:31 you don't need to be aerodynamic to be good
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:15:09 peak aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:15:28 higher the drag = better the plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:16:03 doesn't drag = speed?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:16:19 my uncle from NASA said it does
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:16:30 so you're wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:16:44 oh shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:18:19 I think it's supposed to lessen the stress normal fsw aircraft deal with
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:18:32 I think I might be talking out of my ass
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:19:15 peak aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:19:19 shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:19:41 that's the joke
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:19:54 wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:19:59 it doesn't even have flaps?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:21:09 I think it's thrust vectoring nozzles
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:21:20 I don't know why they're shaped like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:21:49 yes, and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:22:23 le epic troll
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:23:07 needs more drag
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:24:09 this is from the same series
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:25:01 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:25:22 I feel like I'm having a stroke every time I look at it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:26:58 this is the most aerodynamic plane in the whole anime
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:27:57 pretty close
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:28:50 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:28:54 last one
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:29:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:29:57 mig 29?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:30:05 looks more like a Sukhoi
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:32:26 really tempted to post one more
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:33:16 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:34:45 it's a flying aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 07:34:57 a very big flying aircraft
creations-chat 2021-09-07 09:53:22 looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:54:14 how do you guys want the new map to be?
creations-chat 2021-09-07 09:55:28 crossair?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:56:00 funky Sam sight
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:56:10 wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:56:29 I didn't realize that actually was supposed to be a sam
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:57:22 shut the fuck up, fencesitter rank
creations-chat 2021-09-07 09:57:52 I don't think there is a way, shouldn't really matter anyways. I assume you're using rockets for the turret?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:58:51 shut up mid rank
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:59:08 scateboard
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:59:41 Chrome books give me head aches
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:59:44 wait
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 09:59:58 why are you using a Chrome book?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:00:57 I don't think I've heard of somebody using a Chrome book outside of school
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:02:04 wow
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:02:14 slow down, hackerman
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:02:32 dude
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:02:56 I've used discord on my Chrome book without needing to change anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:03:19 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:03:42 my school was pretty loose when it came to Chrome books
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:03:58 impressive
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:04:38 I've seen shit that I really shouldn't have
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:04:45 they didn't remove reddit
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:05:37 I got kicked out right after
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:05:51 they better have not looked at my search history
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:06:36 oh no
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:07:27 I've done art on my Chrome book
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:07:30 no joke
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:07:43 I used to do pixelart back in 6th grade
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:08:49 lol, why are you so high? how tall is your tank?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:09:31 looks nice
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:10:50 how well does it turn?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:11:21 My school was pretty early on the adoption of Chrome books
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:11:34 so they didn't do much when it came to blocking sites
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:11:45 nope
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:12:17 I got a Chromebook again this year
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:12:33 it feels so much more different
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:13:21 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:13:34 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:13:51 when did you start using Chromebooks?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:14:10 I started all the way back in 5th grade
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:14:41 I don't know why they even gave us them
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:15:30 I used to be really into fnaf in 6th grade, so I downloaded a load of images onto my Chrome book.
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:15:49 I check the files on my new Chrome book
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:16:05 and just find like 50 images of fnaf art
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:16:08 god save me
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:16:21 took like a decade to remove
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:16:53 those images were still on my account for like 2 and a half years
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:17:31 Is it still a pain in the ass to change the background image?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:17:59 I remember my background images would reset every time I closed my Chromebook
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:18:13 I had reddit on mine
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:18:15 get gud
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:18:35 what was that?b
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:18:50 I just saw a image pop up
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:19:21 what is a whatsapp?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:19:47 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:19:54 more like Joe mama
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:20:10 wow
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:20:36 it's a ip grabber
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:20:41 don't click on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:20:53 trolled
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:22:13 imagine bypassing restrictions on your Chrome book just so you can use discord
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:22:16 instead of doing your schoolwork
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:22:28 stay in school kids
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:22:47 like
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:23:31 I thought the same way
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:23:37 do you know where that got me?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:23:56 I dropped out of 6th grade
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:24:00 had to do school work
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:24:04 onlne
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:24:36 I had to switch to online school
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:24:43 for 3 years
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:45 Holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:48 I just realized
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:54 it's 6:25
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:56 am
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:26:28 I haven't slept in over 16 hours
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:26:39 est est est
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:26:48 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:27:20 guess we're on the exact opposite side of the world
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:27:55 imagine not being in eastern standard time
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:28:24 no
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:29:40 this is some advanced trench warfare, didn't think the Germans would be hiding in lava.
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:33:16 would you say cockpit when talking about ships?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:34:05 what's the boat equivalent of a cockpit?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:35:16 wouldn't really call this a Bridge
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:35:46 it's the yamato 1
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:36:04 some real fancy boat propulsion shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:36:30 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:36:36 looks cool as hell
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:37:13 uses a "magnetohydrodynamic drive" to move
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:37:29 probably just gonna use a hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:37:55 I don't think you understand what a magnetohydrodynamic drive is
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:38:02 gonna be honest
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:38:21 I also don't
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:38:53 a magnet engine isn't really all that close to this thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:39:53 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamic_drive
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:40:14 I can't say much about it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:40:19 I'm illiterate
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:40:34 so did your mother
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:40:43 when I was with her last night
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:40:56 trolled
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:41:21 I guess it's kinda similar
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:42:04 can a ion engine propel a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:43:01 guess it makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:43:56 do they still use ion engines in spacecraft?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:06 what should I build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:20 the yamato 1 or the j7w?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:40 doesn't sound that hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:59 it's pretty basic
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:47:24 All I would need to make it fly is just add wings inside of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:47:41 and some hidden control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:47:48 I do that all the time
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:42 I just make the fuselage first
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:56 put some wing panals inside
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:58 and boom
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:49:20 It's like flying a lifting body
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:49:29 rolling is hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:50:24 thrust vectoring hover engines sounds like a nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:50:57 do you use the gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:51:38 I don't think I've ever finished a single one of my builds yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:51:42 somehow
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:51:57 I have so many nearly done
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:53:31 I'm trying to find a picture of my only finished fighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:53:39 """ fighter"""
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:54:53 the only reason I considered it finished was because I couldn't add anything else to it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:55:14 it's based off the x-49 night raven
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:55:19 pretty cool aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:55:53 it's all wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:56:42 my aircraft can go 950 and do instant 180s
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:56:49 but that's pretty useless
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:56:57 for a fighter at least
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:58:04 my aircraft just glides down when it stalls
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:58:18 since it's made out of wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:58:26 and nothing but wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:00:42 all my builds run off of hover engines t
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:00:53 they're the perfect engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:01:50 they use way to much space
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:01:57 hover engines are basic as hell
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:02:09 it's 1x2 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:03:12 just place a piston pointing the opposite direction you want to go
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:03:29 then place a hover engine pointing at it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:04:02 setup rise to w and fall to s
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 11:04:39 hover engines are basic and easy
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 20:58:29 working on a way to move my landship
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:00:25 https://streamable.com/9tl5ti
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:00:31 kinda glitchy
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:20:09 it was just some problem with motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:20:14 I switched it to servo
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:20:16 works way better
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 21:59:30 almost finished with the very bottom of my land ship
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 22:01:24 Instead of using treads it's gonna use a air cushion
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 22:02:01 it's basically gonna be a bootleg Shagohod
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 22:18:03 what camo do you guys think I should use?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 22:18:24 forest or desert?
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:12:32 does anybody know how I can get my hydro foil to "take off"?
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:15:56 thanks, I'll try that
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:30:24 his dog ate his mouse
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:35:34 I've gave up on it, I've switched to a different type of ship.
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:44:19 i got a 6k screenshot of his f-35 build
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:05:05 plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:54:23 does anybody have any ideas on how I can make this more complex looking?
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:54:57 good
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:55:04 it's supposed to
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:55:28 I'm trying to make it look overly complex
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:56:20 I need to make every wing surface forward swept
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:56:27 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:56:51 I wonder how a forward swept wing canard would behave
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:57:09 that also isn't a winglit
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:57:21 it's a vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:57:35 the whole plane is made of vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:57:42 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:57:47 no way
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:58:38 
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:58:44 gonna make the whole plane like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:58:51 the drag scares me
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:59:10 it's gonna be a pain in ass to map the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 19:59:43 it can't even take off right now because the control surfaces aren't mapped right
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 20:05:11 
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 20:05:17 pain
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 20:12:00 got any pictures?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 04:43:46 does anybody know what the weird thing on the front of this is? it's a hovercraft tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 04:44:05 thinking of recreating it in pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 04:48:00 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 04:59:05 are you obsessed with the f-100 or something?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 04:59:48 I've never had a problem with hover engines causing lag
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:00:05 is it really that bad?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:00:30 how many hover engines are you guys sticking on your builds?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:01:08 I just need like 4-6
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:01:30 how much thrust do some of you need?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:02:13 it took me adding 25 hover engines to a build for it to start lagging
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:03:07 hovercraft tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:03:15 that's what Wikipedia calls it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:03:33 I don't think I can even make it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:03:37 it's way to tall
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:05:14 got a picture of your abrams?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:06:56 well
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:07:22 that paint is incredibly ugly
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:08:27 still better then my models
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:08:37 I can't even paint them
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:09:50 I have severe Parkinson's
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:10:13 my hands can't stay steady for longer then a second
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:11:25 should I do the bottom or top tank?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:19:06 dead chat
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:19:21 *dies of cringe *
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:19:43 they're both hovercraft tanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:21:00 I'm more into flats
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:21:04 I'm talking about tanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:21:07 and nothing else
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:22:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:22:28 that thing is beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:22:54 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:23:05 it's a Brazilian attack aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:23:10 I think it's from Brazil
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:26:07 thinking about making this tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:26:39 I have 3 days
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:27:10 and I have yet to make more then 2 finished builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:27:37 I'm using the discord app
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:27:45 all names are white for me
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:27:48 I don't see color
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:28:48 I just saw your su-30 build
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:29:05 that has to be the best su-30 I've seen in pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:29:24 what the fuck did you just say?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:29:54 I dig it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:30:20 double
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:30:23 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:30:47 I saw it too
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:31:12 I pointed out it existed right after you deleted it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:31:53 I can't type without autocorrect anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:32:04 it hurts
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:32:47 didn't know there were so many schizos active on this server right now
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:32:58 multiple people saw it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:33:25 the shadow people don't exist
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:33:31 the lizard people do
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:33:49 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:33:55 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:34:56 "Africa" - exquitedboredom
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:35:55 "cope" - weepinhijay
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:36:44 "is just rubber glove in Africa"
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:36:52 what does that even mean
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:37:04 my sanity
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:37:31 do you guys want hear a joke?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:37:37 yo mama
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:37:49 D
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:38:05 double c
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:38:33 triple double double
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:39:10 "no way" - doublewidesuprise
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:39:13 yes way
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:39:35 I think I have brain rot
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:39:52 roasted
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:43:27 thinking of doing the Atlas Carver
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:43:32 it looks pretty simple
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:43:49 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:44:38 f-18?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:44:44 more like a mig 29
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:45:16 the joke isn't funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:45:49 this isn't reddit, repeating the same word isn't funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 05:46:27 I thought I left reddit
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:25:12 grippen sucks
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:25:21 viggen doesn't suck as much
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:26:03 does the viggens canards move?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:26:24 or do they just function as a smaller second wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:27:14 I have killed 7 people in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:27:21 only on the ground sadly
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:27:46 I've noticed they also have control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:27:52 is that just for trim?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:28:10 
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:28:20 ignore that second image
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:28:25 posted that by accident
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:31:40 I'm pretty sure there were many more designs with completely maneuverable canards that existed before the viggen
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:32:21 and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:32:41 cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:32:48 now I cam buy my own viggen
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:33:22 My dad bought a old su-33 off ebay
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:33:25 works pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:33:40 wish saab still sold drakens
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:35:01 Saab made the draken, right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:35:22 couldn't remember
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 06:37:32 use fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:06:41 where are it's control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:07:35 https://streamable.com/xlhemw I was wanting to test this f-15 concept in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:07:44 
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:07:57 I don't know how it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:08:49 I wouldn't say it could fly good without a wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:09:22 it can fly without a wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:09:26 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:09:35 I'm just saying it can't fly well without one
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:10:10 the only reason it could fly was because of it's lifting body
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:10:26 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:10:49 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:11:02 it's called a lifting body
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:11:55 what the hell are you saying?
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:13:38 I said the only reason that the single wing f-15 could actually continue flying was because of the f-15's lifting body fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:15:12 that's the naval mig uav, right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:16:39 oh my god
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:16:43 the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:18:21 is
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:18:38 crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:18:58 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:19:45 
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:19:46 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:19:53 I kinda like how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:20:40 fcas is taking the same route of the b2
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:20:42 flat as fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:21:09 kinda like the wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:21:49 reminds me of the mcdonnell douglas jsf
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:22:15 the far right one reminds me of the ffr-31
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:22:28 with the separate canopies
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:22:56 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:23:59 forgot how alien it looks
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:24:46 I've never been in a dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:24:51 they just aren't fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:25:05 j-20 sounds kinda fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:26:23 nice su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:36:56 I doubt this is gonna go anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:38:57 really stealthy su-57
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:39:02 I can't even see it
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:42:51 why does that get posted here ever day
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:43:00 I want to forget that concept
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:45:10 just found out putting helium blocks on a plane is a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 13:47:43 restart
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 13:02:26 who's x0XKiller?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 13:03:36 what's so special about him?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 13:04:07 looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:17:25 tnt works pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:18:00 a basic anti aircraft could destroy a shedder within seconds
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:18:21 a single part gets damaged and the shredder stops working
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:19:06 cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:19:19 we can have working two seaters now
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:19:46 it happens all the time
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:20:58 how to stop shredders: bully them lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:22:28 just out shredder the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:22:50 turn the shredder into shredded cheese
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:22:59 I'm a comical genius
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:24:22 make a shredder with cutter armor
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:25:09 why are there so few hover drive shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:25:38 shocked
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:25:54 that just seems impractical
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:26:08 is that the f/a xx?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:26:21 nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:26:45 has anybody made the Fairchild f-15 yet?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:18 guess he has made one?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:26 nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:31 I can beat you
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:39 gonna be the first
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:51 imagine needing a 3d model to make a build
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:27:52 weak
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:28:25 that reminds me of the fcas
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:28:36 or like the x-36
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:28:59 it's a vtol?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:29:20 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:29:36 That sounds ineffective
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:29:40 I've tried it before
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:30:13 I've also tried doing the same tactic with roll
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:30:17 that was just awful
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:30:42 what is that?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:31:17 good job
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:31:50 I think I recognize that plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:32:37 that's the Sukhoi t-60
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:32:41 right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:34:40 jojo
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:34:47 more like cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:35:22 machine guns are better then rockets in a lot of situations
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:36:14 just have all guns stacked in a single row
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:36:45 I have that on a generic AA gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:36:48 works perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:37:22 I have the max amount of guns in a row
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:38:01 most builds get destroyed by that
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:38:35 I hope guns handle better in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:39:03 it hurts trying to land a shot with guns in the average plane crazy dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:40:17 I'm surprised by the lack of full 360 guns in pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:41:12 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:41:34 they have to add that
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:42:03 fireworks have like 6 inch radius before they become useless
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:43:04 I don't have the balls to post in creations
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:44:14 "restart, your build looks like shit" isn't criticism
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:44:44 it's kinda cute looking
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:45:53 my first functioning plane build was a half built barrier tutorial build that I modified
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:46:32 they better sound good
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:46:42 love the sound of rocket pods
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:47:56 a almost never notice rockets tracking
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:48:47 the only time it looks like they're moving is when they do a instant 90° turn despite being a mile away
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:48:55 rocket tracking just sucks
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:49:36 I have not improved at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:49:53 my builds have just gotten slightly cleaner
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:50:07 you need to color it
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:50:26 I can't see a single detail
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:50:58 I hope they make rockets thinner
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:51:30 hopefully you can place rockets under your wing in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:52:01 tnt
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:52:29 get rid of cutters
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:53:08 gjsol who?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:54:12 I don't understand the procedurally generated map
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:54:52 I'm not
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:55:32 why not just make a map
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:55:54 it doesn't need to be infinite
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:56:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:57:14 manually making the map is way better then infinite map
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:57:48 make it like 50 miles or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:57:59 have space for ship battles and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:59:11 having battles is gonna be way harder
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 14:59:36 when you can't even find anybody to fight with
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:00:24 yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:00:41 I've been saying that the whole time
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:01:02 looks good
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:02:34 have the map be something like 100 miles
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:03:12 you can have space for more shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:04:07 a manual map could be more optimized for stuff as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:04:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:05:03 we've been saying the same thing for the last 10 minutes now
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:05:32 there's almost no space for boats
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:06:11 we don't need a infinite sea
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:06:21 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:07:21 we just need a bigger Ocean
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:07:29 we don't need a infinite Ocean
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:07:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:08:02 I think
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:08:36 Can't wait to make a 1/1 scale carrier
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:08:43 hopefully
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:09:36 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:09:47 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:10:02 can't wait to spawn in
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:10:14 and sail for a month just to find somebody
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:11:08 the water portion of the map should be like 50 miles
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:11:45 I can't wait to make my real homeless diamond
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:11:50 and have it work
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:12:26 they better add rivers and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:12:36 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:13:44 a infinite map is just impractical
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:13:53 why did they even decide to do it
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:15:07 it's Pac man
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:15:45 use Google maps and make the map perfectly realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:16:03 sr
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:16:11 the earth is flat
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:16:14 don't lie
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:16:41 globetard^
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:16:55 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:17:02 I'm a 100% real flat earther
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:18:22 the earth is a octagon
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:18:36 my uncle (who works at the cia) told me so
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:19:06 the earth is yo mom
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:19:24 the entire earth is America
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:19:41 I always knew Australians weren't real
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:20:49 the earth is a Scutoid
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:21:22 earth is a pancake
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:21:59 do you guys know what's bigger then the universe?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:22:03 yo mom
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:22:31 ok dude
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:22:39 you're dragging the joke out
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:23:23 I'm about to speedrun that shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:23:49 so deep
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:24:22 that's about as deep as a puddle
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:24:41 it really isn't
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:25:37 not real
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:26:03 with wings so small I don't see how it could gain lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:26:51 thrust
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:26:58 probably
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:27:33 please no
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:27:39 I don't want to imagine that
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:27:58 drag is pretty gay
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:28:55 he should make stuff like props and jets pore powerful
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:29:10 since the map is gonna be bigger
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:29:58 make it so can angle a wing downwards without motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:30:08 like a winglit
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:30:23 or the xb-70 wing tips
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:30:55 add different types of lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:31:07 like compression lift
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:31:14 or lifting body's
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:32:12 have you seriously not heard of nihilism?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:32:37 what the fuck are you guys talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:32:54 this is a robox discord server
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:33:52 isn't this a bit to surreal for the plane crazy discord server?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:34:16 make the map bigger
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:34:25 nobody has said that yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:34:39 Dragon
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:34:44 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:35:07 before this we were talking about the map needing to be bigger
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:35:45 nobody was saying anything original besides "make the map bigger"
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:36:39 procedural map is gonna suck though
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:37:23 infinite oceans is still gonna suck
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:37:59 just give the map a border
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:38:18 it's already be said about 50 times
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:38:23 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:38:26 add caves
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:39:35 imagine making the map destroyable
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:39:52 it's a joke
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:40:29 everybody knows that
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:40:33 besides a few people
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:41:02 add tunnels
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:41:04 would be epic
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:41:27 and trenches
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:41:56 I can't think of a single ace combat game without one
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:42:12 it has one
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:42:18 I've played it
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:42:41 I hope they add some mega Airport or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:42:52 and harbors
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:43:27 maybe have a aircraft carrier that you can spawn on
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:45:04 I was thinking of it basically being a runway in the water
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:45:27 ^
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:45:50 make the map like 100 miles
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:46:17 chat died hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:46:34 they should add swamps
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:46:40 and Forest
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:47:05 make the game a bit more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:47:12 add the ground effect
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:47:41 I just want a functioning w.i.g
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:48:11 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:49:02 make a f-22 like everybody else
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:49:18 make a yf-22
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:49:23 far more original
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:50:28 make a f-23
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 15:50:40 surpass the yf-23
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 22:16:34 dead chat
* does of cringe *
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 22:17:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 00:01:49 you really just need a lot of thurst
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 00:02:50 wings are only needed if you want to control the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 00:02:57 only the weak use wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 00:03:21 my aircraft ain't gay
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 00:03:30 I fly using pure thurst
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 01:16:47 "retro"fit a jet and turn it into a prop plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:12:14 a heavily rushed and unfinished I-2000
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:12:24 still need to cover up some stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:13:39 need to switch the elevators to motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:36:21 
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:36:30 almost done
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:01 
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:16 messed up on the front "flaps"
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:33 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:39 I can't add them
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:53 didn't think about them when I first made the wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:43:57 so there's no space
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:46:45 looks pretty good at this angle
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:46:54 shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:47:07 
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:51:40 swing wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:56:33 I like the front of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:59:22 man
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 22:59:37 those are some short wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:00:53 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:01:29 reminds me of the s-54
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:01:34 do to how short it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:02:20 what type
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:02:29 good
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:02:59 what the hell
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:10:35 so not jupiter?
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:35 Jupiter is overrated
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:12:39 neptune is where it's at
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:13:14 uranus is my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:14:38 titian is pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:32:05 so random and quirky
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 23:38:35 maybe in plane crazy 2
creations-chat 2021-09-19 09:56:40 that doesn't look very aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:57:16 what's happening?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:57:54 funni
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:00:31 imagine making hot chocolate with water
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:00:42 actually disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:00:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:01:08 what's your point?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:02:14 chocolate milk with hot chocolate powder
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:05:25 please
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:05:29 shut the fuck up
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 01:53:35 first finished land build
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 01:54:20 not perfect but I'm satisfied with it
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 01:56:15 the little things in the front help the "tank" move
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:26:58 that has to be like 10 feet in the air
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:27:06 why are you calling it low?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:28:02 for a space station
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:28:08 that's very low
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:29:27 15 minutes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:29:37 and you're only at that height?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:29:46 how slow is your build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:31:09 and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:32:40 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:33:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:33:42 use more
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:36:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:40:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:40:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:42:21 weak
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:43:39 conv engine is impractical
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:43:45 use hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:45:12 you just can't accept the truth that hover engines are objectively better in every way but speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:46:59 I can't even watch the video
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:47:03 so get owned
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:47:26 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:47:36 I have to download the video
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:47:55 I'm on the discord app
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:48:11 it forces me to download it
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:48:19 I can't watch it on the app
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:49:25 got it to run
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:49:43 I'm like 5% sure you could do that without a conv engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:49:50 you would just need to change some shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:50:03 shit shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:51:01 hehe you said A
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:51:07 aren't you real funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:51:36 sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:53:12 tl;dr
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:53:38 hard core cope
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:57:40 I use them for stability and size
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:01:04 broken English = funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:02:20 I've never seen somebody actually use the word manky
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:02:40 let alone so many times
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:06:35 rockets for yaw
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:06:39 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:09:10 go backwards
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:09:14 sounds practical
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:09:36 vesteria?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:40:03 it looks awful
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:40:35 I hate people who whine about exposed lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:40:41 but that's way to much
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:40:55 it's not even passable
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:41:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:41:32 it's more motorlock then f-16
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:42:13 imagine being such a bitch that you use props instead of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:42:17 weak
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:43:25 why does the elevator look so ugly?
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:43:36 did you motorlock that as well?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:26:58 a what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:30:34 your steak looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:31:29 what aircraft is that?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:32:56 why did it even get upvoted?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:33:07 it's not funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:33:15 I doubt it's even hard to make
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:06 just because it's unique doesn't mean anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:14 it still looks like garbage
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:24 69 funni
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:40 it's function isn't even interesting
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:36:17 fencesitter
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:36:22 pretty cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:36:54 is that a su-30 or su-37?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:37:55 RAtiO!1!!11!
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:39:07 is that using super rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:39:21 I think I see the particle effects
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:39:50 how did that get 44 upvotes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:39:58 how in hell
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:41:58 who?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:08 pcc is a hivemind
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:31 echo chamber
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:53 it's just like reddit
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:59 it's giving me ptsd
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:45:50 more then half of that probably don't even browse here
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:46:36 there's probably like 500 people here that actively browse here
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:47:00 I love how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:47:37 it actually looks like a su-30
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:47:42 unlike most
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:49:14 that's a mig 29, right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:49:25 or
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:49:49 looks different
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:50:24 looks way more like a mig 29
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:52:25 could've picked a better color scheme
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:54:57 you're like 15 minutes behind
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:55:51 we can't have alts?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:56:29 what?

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:36:58 Russia doesn't have a very good reputation
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:37:15 America is way better
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:37:45 that's omega cringe

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:43:56 that's not a f-15
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:44:20 It looks like a trainer
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:44:26 like a yak 130
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:44:53 looks better at that angle
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:45:09 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:45:27 have you seen the f-15's wing?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:45:40 that wing reminds me of the fcas

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:48:53 and say it's a f-15?

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 13:09:15 it looks more like a lobster
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 13:10:10 don't be a asshole
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 13:10:19 that's one way to blend into lower ranks
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 13:11:39 thinking of making ramiel
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 13:14:21 wondering if I should use hover thrusters for it or not

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:28:03 is there any good tips on how to make a build more stable?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:28:32 ground stability?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:28:35 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:28:44 aircraft stability
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:29:26 I was working on sr-71 earlier
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:29:42 even going 400 would cause it to start flipping out
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:29:54 Why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:30:09 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:30:14 I didn't even buy my pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:30:30 it's like 7 years old
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:30:49 my sr-71 would just shake up and down when going 450
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:31:17 7 years isn't that old
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:31:34 Obama was still around when I got my pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:31:36 Jesus
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:32:52 it's only 3 decades old
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:32:58 it isn't that bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:33:16 that was like yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:44:14 I was still playing roblox back then
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 08:46:02 did you not play roblox on the Sega master system?

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:04:35 /high effort
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:05:28 it's so nose heavy
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:05:39 it can't take off without doing 5 backflips
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:06:24 the wings would've already done
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:06:26 that
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:07:12 do you think I can get away with posting this is creations?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:07:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:08:03 it took me 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:08:11 that's high effort
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:09:32 just did it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 12:10:43 it took me 2 minutes and 13 seconds

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:16:29 bigger plots is gonna be my favorite part of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:16:46 imagine making 1:1 aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:17:25 it kind of looks more like a adf-01 then a adfx-02
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:17:54 might try that
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:18:23 imagine if it still had wingtip landing gears
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:18:31 15 feet long landing gears
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:19:04 that doesn't even make sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:19:13 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:19:22 folding has it's limits
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:20:34 cool

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:26:10 I'll watch
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:28:10 I want to see it
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:43:55 I came up with this complex way to use hover engines on ground vehicles. I then realized that I could just add a piston to push a piston in front of the hover thruster
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:44:02 wasted so much time
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:45:34 looks so good
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:45:59 funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:47:15 could've just have done this
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:47:20 would've taken 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:47:57 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:48:23 why would I even do that?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:48:51 what does that even have to do with my hover thing?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:49:10 I'm not looking for speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:49:23 what does that even mean?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:49:51 why would I need a motor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:50:05 what do you think I'm doing?
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 12:52:00 it's something to say the least
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:05:51 the canopy area looks way to small
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:06:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:07:13 guess the camo is confusing you

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:27:52 I watched a bit of dream when he started getting popular (before a 500 thousand) but his content just gets boring after he post the 50th hunter video
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:28:16 looks like a train
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:29:05 I was pretty close
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:29:41 goodbye
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:31:30 are you sure that's gonna be able to vtol?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:33:20 what do you guys think I should build?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:33:22 the first one is a spacecraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:33:32 second one is a seaplane
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:33:45 or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:40:57 what's so weird about it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:41:09 what does that even mean?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:41:32 what about it is a maxor reference?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:41:46 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:42:04 but why did you bring it up?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:42:16 it's random
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:42:43 you're not funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:43:06 sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:43:25 it's not a reference
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:43:36 what makes you think it's a reference?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:44:00 I've watched his videos

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:45:24 I kinda like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:45:30 just for it's weirdness
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:45:39 it's like if iran made a f-35
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:46:46 there is a real aircraft called the ka-35
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:47:35 is that the funny British 6th gen aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:47:51 thought it looked like the tempest
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:48:17 I just didn't see a vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:49:31 if you can't make it a vtol
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:49:39 just say it's a f-35c
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:49:58 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:50:26 why?
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:50:37 just give it more thrust
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 11:51:13 just more thrust

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:32:33 he didn't know how to use ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:32:44 so he used jets to bring his ship down
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:33:40 never saw it in the water
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:33:46 I only saw it on the base
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:34:31 I doubt it even did that
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:34:45 it looked like ass
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:35:06 my thing used hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:35:28 and he just used hover thursters
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:35:35 he didn't even use a piston
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:35:47 just hover thrusters pointing backwards
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:36:02 I don't know why he even copied mine
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 21:36:59 holy shit

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:10:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:11:32 I have a idea
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:11:40 why don't you make a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:18 when did you start to notice this change?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:41 I hope they fix it soon
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:23:50 rockets have been broken for me for almost a week now
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:04 I can't use them anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:25 what is there to elaborate on?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:35 I just said rockets don't work for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:42 can't give much more detail
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:50 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:24:55 they don't even push forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:02 same thing for props and jets
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:14 I've had this problem for a week now
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:41 it's really hard to play the game
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:46 when you can't move forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:25:55 I'm stuck using hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:26:45 almost all my builds are broken
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:26:55 since I can't use rockets or props
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:27:22 I only use mess around with hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:27:28 the rest are way to complex for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:29:54 what kind of air intake are you doing?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:30:04 like a f-15 ramp intake or what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:30:58 I guess 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:31:11 it kind of looks big
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:31:15 for a single engine aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:36:01 what is it?\
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:36:22 like a blimp?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 22:36:29 or a actual flying ship?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:45:19 eurobeat

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:11 why did you even make it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:50 you couldn't be bothered to make a original build
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:48:52 lazy fuck
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:49:42 it's a abnormally weak excuse
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:10 just watch a few tutorials on how to make a jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:18 then make a jet yourself
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:48 that's how I figured out how to make planes and boats
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:50:58 you don't need to directly copy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 05:51:52 then why don't you have a new PvP jet?

creations-chat 2021-10-17 00:35:53 it could take me 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:36:16 why are so many people asking this?
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:43:53 just use motor 2 servo
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:44:04 and place a wing panel on it
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:45:40 water props aren't gonna do anything
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:45:51 they propel your ship forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:46:01 they don't let your ship turn
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:47:12 
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:47:16 basic rudder
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:47:19 just user motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:47:25 and set it as servo
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:47:49 and change  F R to A D
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:49:20 of course
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:49:42 what ship should I do?
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:49:44 destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:49:45 carrier
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:49:51 .
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 00:50:41 what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 02:57:54 looks like every pvp car I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 02:59:14 I did
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:03:29 not even new players
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:03:36 almost every player
creations-chat 2021-10-17 03:06:35 <@740520273073274961> I love that mini pak da
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:07:18 I started with a basic stationary gun
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:07:28 still my most effective build
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:08:29 I had just stacked all the guns onto my gun
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:09:05 the gun itself was just a flew blocks connected to 2 motor twos
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:11:10 how is your custom aircraft doing?
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:12:27 that reminds me of a wing in ground effect plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:12:38 the way the wings are
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:13:17 that's the average wing design for a g.e.v
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:14:25 
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:14:39 it looks similar
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:14:43 if you squirt
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:14:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:15:05 that's a Russian one
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:15:18 most of them are Russian
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 03:15:55 ask nasa for help

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:15:56 rank 3 or 6
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:33 maybe when pc2 comes out and they increase the size of the plot you can make a really big helicopter with the swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:17:34 imagine a race track
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:17:48 instead of 2010 bumpy terrain
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:18:26 add a tunnel
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:19:03 add a wedge 1x7
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:19:58 add a rotate tool so I can rotate my whole build
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:20:14 get rid of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:20:22 make the game 3d modelling
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:21:19 add 3500x3500 plots
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:18 I want to be able to look over my build like I'm 3d modelling
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:32 I hate having to be on the ground when building
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:40 make the map bigger
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:24:38 I just block up like minecraft
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:27:29 what is it based on?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:28:00 his tank
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:28:57 era?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:29:25 just give your ww1 bomber thurst vectoring
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:29:26 easy fix
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:30:09 no way
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:30:14 ww1 can't be that old
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:05:32 what happened?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:07:46 what's so special about this?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:07:57 this happens like every week
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:08:34 could've just said that
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:09:03 what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:09:34 I don't keep track of this shit
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 22:11:45 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 05:59:51 I've tried
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 21:09:12 came up with the dumbest way to turn a vehicle in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 21:18:02 does anybody have any idea on how to turn this thing?
I'm having to use piston and ballast blocks to lean the thing left and right
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 02:05:45 imgaine bein lietrate
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 02:19:13 dead chat
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 02:19:19 * dies of cringe *
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 19:42:32 I don't know what I did
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 19:42:58 I was messing around with the camera glitch
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:12:57 
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:13:17 is this the one you're taking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:13:28 or did you make another?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:15:34 I assume this is the "copy" you're talking about
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:15:45 doesn't look that similar
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:17:19 oh fuck
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:17:28 I should've reread that
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:20:45 it's definitely a copy
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:21:00 I can see it now
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:21:47 why would you give it such a ugly paint job
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:21:54 that shade of green is awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:22:31 let me check
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:23:37 I've only found a airfox model that had that shade of green
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:24:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:24:51 most 2nd gen jets were a tin color
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:25:01 really shiny
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:25:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:26:07 the 80's and 70's had some really nice looking experimental camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:26:46 
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:28:53 why springs at all?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:29:24 give it cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:32:28 swordfish irl are pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:32:57 ew
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:33:24 I doubt that
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:33:53 I thought you were talking about irl swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:34:00 the fish type of swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:34:15 but they aren't apex predators
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:34:20 that's what I'm talking About
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:34:42 I do
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:34:53 from land
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:35:44 I'm just gonna pull out the aps rifle
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:36:00 that weird Russian underwater gun abomination
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:36:24 if it's close enough
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:36:35 I think a railgun might work
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:39:16 I've been wanting to work on this for ages now but every tank track tutorial has broken on me
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:39:46 that's the crew
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:39:56 don't be rude to them
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:41:09 I've thought of a way to recreate the water
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:42:04 I would recreate the deck out of glass
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:42:15 make it above the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:42:29 and it would fall down onto the deck
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:42:42 it would be very thick water
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:44:02 I'll try that first
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:44:20 I still need to figure out how to make tracks
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:44:56 can conveyors actually move you forward?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:45:08 huh
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:45:11 never knew
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:47:03 ew
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:47:05 female
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:47:21 is that a girl
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:47:30 playing video games
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:47:37 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:15:41 mig 25
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:16:06 it's a mig 25
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:16:32 that's the only thing in the world that is called a foxbat
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:16:52 nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:17:14 I think the bat part is because the mig 25 has massive vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:17:18 or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:18:32 I have no clue why the mig 31 is called foxhound
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:18:53 really?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:19:06 never heard of that before
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:19:18 just look at the mig 15
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:19:24 great nato name
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:20:02 I doubt it's referring to that
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:20:54 the an-22 has a really good name
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:21:56 already made that joke
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:21:58 become original
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:22:32 su-75 femboy
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:22:39 they better name it that
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:24:43 what the hell are you guys talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:25:51 I have a massive an-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:26:21 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:27:07 have the Swedish ever made a good fighter?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:27:18 besides the draken?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:27:30 I said good
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:28:48 being cheap isn't a good all of the time
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:29:32 I could buy 5 f-86
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:29:43 but a single f-22 won't have a problem
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:30:45 it's cheap though so it's good
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:31:11 ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:31:30 still
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:31:41 a f-22 could destroy a lot of them
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:32:04 having multiple fighters is pointless when they can be destroyed so easily
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:32:37 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:33:05 Chinese 9th generation mach 25 fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:33:45 most hypersonic aircraft look the exact same
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:33:56 you're pretty limited
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:34:59 waverider aircraft are just lame looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:35:47 we have satellites now
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:36:33 just get more satellites intill it's impossible for them to hide
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:37:14 cover the money in a artificial satellite
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:37:26 cover a satellite in a satellite
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:38:01 I don't think wall e is a good source
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:38:43 just put a big camera on the moon
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:38:49 they can't hide from the moon
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:39:24 stfu e
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:40:02 piss on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:40:48 make a new moon
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:40:54 problem solved
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:41:12 didn't know you were a scientist
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:41:36 make mars crash into earth
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:41:40 recreate the moon
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:41:55 the same way it happened 3 million years ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:42:12 make a big laser and shave mars
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:42:15 make it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:42:43 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:42:53 really
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:43:05 3 n's is a bad word?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:43:37 I paint mine a mid blue
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:43:43 so I can see edges better
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:45:07 make that 1 downvote
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:45:12 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:46:35 I doubt your plane is getting into hof either
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:48:49 paint it a color you like
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:49:11 paint it grey then
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:49:32 then keep it grey
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:50:51 it's luigi colani
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:51:14 he makes really weird vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:51:44 x-50?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:52:21 luigi colani makes some really weird shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:52:46 looks nothing like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:53:16 looks like the most generic sci-fi garbage I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:56:09 Send a picture of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:56:52 The first aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:19:14 dm him
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:19:34 dm him
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:20:01 make him feel embarrassed for being caught copying
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:20:34 I'm scared to talk to mods
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:22:15 the only time I talk to mods it's usually me being banned or warned
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:22:26 sometimes both at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:23:33 I said multiple racial slurs
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:24:26 this is the longest time I've been in a server
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:24:45 why wouldn't you?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:24:53 it's a big part of the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:25:16 they plan on letting you move builds from pc to pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:25:24 it wouldn't make sense to remove it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:26:34 put them against the wall
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:30:02 looks pretty similar to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:30:29 wouldn't make sense adding that if that section wasn't gonna be painted
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:30:57 his copy is just a single color
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:31:40 I just got discord for my phone
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:31:55 apparently I get notifications when I'm @
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:33:32 ass
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:33:50 thought that would be censored
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:34:43 dm me it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:34:54 I don't care
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:34:59 I've probably seen worse
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:35:25 dm me it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:35:40 commimusm funni
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:36:49 where is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:36:55 I need to know
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:37:34 .
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:37:43 .
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:39:48 it is slightly better then I thought it would be
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:39:56 still looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:40:24 murder
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:45:31 2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:45:42 I thought the f-16 only had 1
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:50:52 use helium on the heavier side
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:51:59 where is the gun?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:54:02 increase the torque
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:54:58 both motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:01:14 that's a morgan
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:01:24 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:02:14 the black underbelly of the Morgan really help adds to the looks
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:02:24 it looks odd without it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:06:45 where is the rudder?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:08:11 the rudder is at the vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:08:13 right?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:38:48 nice morgan
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:40:38 does anybody know how to make the spinning circle thing that are on awacs aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:41:15 the rotodome
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:43:10 I assume a half cylinder could work but I don't know how I could do the white stripe on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:45:28 what even is that aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:46:25 it looks good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:35 pontoons suck
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:00 how did you not give up?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:31 I can barely even finish a build most of the time
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:49:33 get good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:50:11 goodbye
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:50:16 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:50:41 galm even better
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:50:53 upeo is best
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:42 ace combat 7 is ridiculous
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:50 the older games were slightly better
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:30 guess everybody forgot about the redbull tunnel thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:44 it was a prop plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:50 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:59 even took off inside of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:53:16 it went into 2 tunnels
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:53:43 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=19fQAxys9q8
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:54:16 you're making it out as if it's impossible
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:54:26 the tunnels in ace combat are pretty big
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:55:54 ace combat x wasn't that bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:55:59 pretty slow turn rate
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:56:23 x has like 2 tunnel runs
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:56:55 it's near the end
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:57:24 you have to fly through a straight tunnel to take out some submarine base
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:57:30 or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:58:09 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:58:35 has the best fictional aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:59:07 ace combat 3 is pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:59:34 has the best tunnel run in the whole series
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:00:21 3 has some insane shit in its tunnel run
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:01:18 you can emulate it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:01:51 all the ace combat games I've played were emulated
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:02:04 ace combat 3 was on the ps1
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:03:48 the pzl thing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:04:53 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:05:03 it's so odd looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:05:11 the proportions
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:05:31 sukhoi will always be best
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:06:12 f-57?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:06:28 the su-57 would win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:06:45 f-22 probably
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:07:16 if the f-22 lost both it's wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:07:20 the su-57 could win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:07:46 if the f-22 fell apart mid flight the su-57 could win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:07:53 the f-22 isn't that big
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:08:08 I think the f-15 is bigger
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:08:48 the f-4 would always lose
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:09:02 who would win?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:09:15 1 f-86 or 22 f-22's?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:09:26 I think the f-86 would win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:09:39 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:09:45 you're just wrong
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:10:02 it's a attack aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:10:15 it isn't winning any dogfights
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:11:05 in bvr the f-35 would win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:11:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:12:21 the f-35 is just ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:13:08 I think the fc-31 looks better
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:13:12 visually
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:13:26 the twin engines look better
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:13:56 it's old black paint also looks cool as hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:14:21 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:14:33 What the hell is a c33?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:15:07 if you give it 23mm anti aircraft guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:15:11 the c33 might win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:15:43 surface to air missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:15:56 who the hell calls them ground to air?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:17:13 been thinking of doing this for a while
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:17:28 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:18:00 who would win?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:18:20 the vva-14 or a ngad 6th gen fighter jet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:18:48 the vva-14 would fly above it and drop its depth charges on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:18:58 easy win
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:20:00 are you taking about the weird forward swept wing variable wing Sukhoi aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:20:45 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:20:47 this?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:21:20 I still don't know if that was a real concept
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:21:54 I've seen it mentioned on secretprojects.uk but it's such a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:23:50 should I do the sukhoi t-12 or the sukhoi x wing thing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:25:14 my extremely obscure plane knowledge scares me sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:25:56 that would be a long ass tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:26:59 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:27:12 that dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:27:32 chronic dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:27:47 how does he even know how to breathe?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:28:05 grey
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:28:17 7
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:28:34 155
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:28:40 that's what I use
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:29:28 I like it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:29:41 looks ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:29:51 tower?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:30:10 motor lock?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:30:53 he said it was a mig 29
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:31:03 scroll down for one second
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:32:47 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:33:12 I've never heard of the mig 39
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:34:03 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:34:19 I think that was just a rumor
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:34:34 I don't think it was ever officially called the mig 39
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:34:49 mi-39
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:34:59 sounds like a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:35:52 the mig 37 is that 80's stealth model kit thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:35:54 right?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:36:47 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:36:51 I have that model irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:37:04 I fucked it up badly
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:37:49 I tried painting the canopy gold to look like the f-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:37:53 it went horribly
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:39:11 the mig 41 is a 5th gen version of the mig 21 made by some ukrainian artist
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:40:06 Alexander Yartsev
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:40:34 the mig 41 is "real"
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:40:40 the art shown with it isn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:41:20 ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:41:43 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:42:07 what the hell are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:42:38 what even is that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:43:05 I thought it was a sr-72 at first
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:43:14 but the weapons are external
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:43:20 so it just looks weird
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:43:54 the xfa-33 is like 7th generation
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:43:57 for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:44:31 I hated fighting them
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:45:34 whenever I follow them with the camera I have to deal with the camera switching between 4 targets
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:45:38 it's so annoying
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:46:10 alect squadron was hard but fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:46:27 but the xfa-33 were just annoying
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:47:09 having 3 powerful special weapons is pretty op
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:47:40 you have a nuke, laser, and the missile defense thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:47:48 all in one plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:47:58 xfa-33
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:48:46 it would just fire a lswm at the ground
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:49:00 at the Morgan would blow up
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:49:34 I play ace combat x with missile rapid fire on
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:49:38 and with the xfa-33
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:49:54 it's insane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:50:20 I just fire 20 lswm at the ground
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:50:27 and clear the whole map
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:50:47 and?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:51:01 a ecm isn't gonna stop a explosion
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:51:10 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:52:01 elevators?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:52:09 aren't those vertical stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:52:40 eh
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:53:06 is that the mig 1.44 or what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:53:44 it probably would've taken a bit for V2 to launch
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:54:30 I don't think you can just open a hatch and launch it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:54:50 ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:54:59 like 5 people played ace combat x
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:55:18 I can tell
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:56:41 What?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:56:43 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:56:51 why would you be punished?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:57:13 can you send a picture of the mig 39?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:58:00 theirs 5 people on earth who call it a mig 39
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:58:18 I think that's a mig 1.42 as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:58:55 the mig 1.42 would've been the production version
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 03:59:51 Morgan looks better
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:00:04 the morgan is like 10 feet longer then a f-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:01:08 the su-27 and it's variations are huge
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:01:23 need a lot of fuel
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:01:43 imagine if they were the size of a normal plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:02:32 they would be incredibly  maneuverable
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:03:05 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:03:50 If you were to scale the mig 29 up to the su-27 it would be pretty sluggish
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:04:08 the su-27 is just really maneuverable
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:04:21 so it being smaller would make it even more maneuverable
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:04:23 I think
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:04:34 I'm not a aerospace engineer
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:04:59 the x-49 is really huge
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:05:05 it's wingspan is insane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:06:38 wrong image
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:06:57 x-43 is some hypersonic scramjet thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:07:16 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:07:54 servo
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:08:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:08:51 I think the Gleipnir is even bigger then the Arsenal bird
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:09:26 people are lazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:10:13 the maus is such a overdone tank tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:10:33 it's like the adfx-01 and f-14 being such a overdone aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:10:53 I might be confusing them
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:11:03 I'm not a tank guy
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:11:24 I see a adfx-01 every week
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:11:53 I rarely see a mig 21
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:12:07 it should already move with your mouse
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:12:17 it's motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:12:40 the f-18 is also really overdone
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:13:10 I will never understand why people love the f-18 so much
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:13:13 it's insane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:13:27 the amount of times I see it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:14:10 how do you know how to motor lock but not know how to use motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:14:53 the f-18 isn't even that cool of a aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:16:19 a good looking falken is even rarier
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:16:48 what raven?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:17:59 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:18:41 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:19:04 I was making a joke about the x-49 and adx-11 having the same name
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:19:20 that brings a tear to my eye
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:19:30 it's beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:23:34 what kind of German guy?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:23:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:23:55 it looks like a Minecraft skin
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:26:26 do you guys have any idea on how I could improve my Christ-car?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:26:35 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:29:03 I can't believe they banned Jesus from the rome server
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:30:08 🤮
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:32:10 jesus
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:32:17 jeSUS
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:32:56 I can't believe pcc is rome

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:35:52 I'm getting a new pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:36:08 so I was wondering if I should get w11
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:36:18 fumo=cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:36:53 rei chikita=based and redpilled
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:37:26 I haven't had any huge problems with Windows 10
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:38:07 I've been using it for like 6 years now
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:42:24 why does he keep calling it a mig 39?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:42:35 he said it was a f-15 as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:43:32 I like the way windows 11 looks
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:43:53 handles?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:43:57 it's not a car
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:44:06 it's a operating system
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:44:33 who refers to it like that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:45:08 I'm not
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:45:17 I just don't know what aircraft it even is
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:45:33 you keep switching between what aircraft you're working on
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:46:22 what the fuck is a mig 39?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:46:34 I've asked this 20 times

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:49:32 then a mig 39
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 04:49:49 then you called it a f-15

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:02:42 I'm aware
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:02:52 I've played ace combat
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:03:15 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:04:20 I'm pretty sure Yuktobania is supposed to be russia
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:04:31 which one?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:04:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:05:14 have you not played ace combat 0 before?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:05:27 it's very obvious that belka is Germany
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:06:16 ace combat 0 is cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:06:25 ace combat 3 is where it's at
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:07:04 it has cooler looking aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:07:38 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:08:02 you can do high g maneuvers in 0
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:08:23 I already pointed it out

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:12:45 it was awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:12:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:12:57 I have never bought a ace combat game
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:13:06 or any game for that matter
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:13:48 I could try and help you
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:13:56 but it would take a while
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:14:45 you need to play ace combat 3 and x as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:14:47 good games
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:16:17 I don't feel bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:16:20 at all
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:16:24 for anything
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:17:35 and download the rom
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:17:45 I think you can get it off vimms lair
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:18:04 I thrust no other site
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:19:41 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:20:30 not that bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:20:38 but what tutorial?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:21:12 are you using that green helicopter tutorial?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:21:27 imagine paying for your games
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:21:31 gay and cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:22:06 I can't even run those
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:22:24 my pc is 6 years old
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:22:36 and it's like a office pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:24:34 dead meme
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:25:13 it was almost 2 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:26:11 is that the fucking protogen face thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:26:34 I'm talking about the evil meme thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:26:46 the format itself is dead
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 05:27:42 that wasn't a discord meme
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:02:31 it is
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:02:50 nice to hear
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:05:19 pirating isn't the right word for a 15 year game
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:05:58 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:06:18 why do most earlier helicopters look so ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:06:50 it looks like a brick painted blue
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:07:03 and you put a propeller on top
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:07:36 it looks like a brick painted white and red
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:07:51 look like rockets to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:10:38 dead chat
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:11:06 I feel like the f-4 is a overdone build
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:11:25 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:11:30 it was a joke
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:11:35 I've done it before
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:11:51 default
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:12:21 I don't think gravity well have a huge effect
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:12:48 is it ok if it has wings?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:13:01 or do you want a pure brick?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:13:21 I guess thrust based lift is possible
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:14:50 imagine having skill and talent
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:14:53 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:16:05 why do you want to edit peoples tanks?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:16:44 make your own tank
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:17:04 why don't you just edit
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:17:08 real photos?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:17:23 it's not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:17:45 that's way to over edited
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:18:55 it's a pistol round
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:20:07 what the fuck?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:20:43 how is that a war crime?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:21:15 it's a end of evangelion pfp
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:21:46 29*
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:21:52 dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:22:35 mayo

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:22:57 your mom
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:26:40 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:26:48 it's <#495286269459300364>  now
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:30:06 white evas?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:30:24 mass production Eva's?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:30:39 he doesn't fight any whites eva's
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:30:53 did you watch the movie?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:31:03 the mass production Eva's
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:31:08 that Asuka fought
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:31:28 dementia ^^
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:32:17 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:32:19 just one more off topic meme
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:33:41 they're connected with the eva
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:33:45 mentally
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:34:01 and physically
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:34:46 why not just make a cosmo falcon?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:34:58 instead of editing a plane Into it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:35:08 sounds like a lot more effort
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:35:39 it doesn't look like a very good plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:36:24 it doesn't look like a good plane at all
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:36:31 not just visually
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:36:50 and?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:37:07 that's not very impressive
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:38:05 I have a plane that can go 1250 speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:38:12 how is 500 all that impressive?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:38:47 but why point out it can go 500 then?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:39:43 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:42:36 what aircraft should I do?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:43:08 top one is the sukhoi s-32
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:44:23 guess the mig 1.44 wins
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:45:05 that's a s-32
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:45:23 not a su-47
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:45:37 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:46:11 hi Pro fix
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:46:18 I'm dad
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:47:41 hi you're dumb

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:54:52 I can't tell if it's the stream or if it's just your computer
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:55:15 is my Mic on
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:55:30 oh fuck
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:57:06 thank god I didn't say anything
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:58:13 I forgot how good this soundtrack is
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:58:30 s-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:58:38 it's a real concept plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:58:53 only a windtunnel model
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:59:04 looks really gold
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:59:07 good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:59:20 f-17 is kinda real
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 06:59:51 would've been better then the f-16
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:00:00 it should've won
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:00:46 I think it actually is a s-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:01:01 it has no elevators
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:01:20 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:01:23 servo
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:01:40 I see it now
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:02:22 what did you hear?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:02:42 good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:02:54 such a great pilot
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:04:14 does your audio sound kinda odd on your side as well?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:04:26 weird
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:05:24 nice shot on their house
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:06:11 what are you using to steam?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:10:52 maybe don't do bad things
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:11:22 people won't remember you if you don't do bad things
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:11:56 why did you ever do it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:12:12 I can't remember shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:15:02 what difficulty are you on?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:15:51 I should've just checked your guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:15:57 would've showed me
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:16:58 they're very good missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:17:07 they turn really fast
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:17:21 I think the can miss and go around and still hit a target
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:17:37 hell yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:17:52 who filled my cockpit with water?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:19:00 why do so many belkan aces have British accents
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:19:23 belka is Germany
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:20:17 the flat earth squadron also have British accents
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:22:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:23:56 brute force tactics
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:26:12 nice su-27
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:26:28 what are you using to stream?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:26:50 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:27:42 why is the f-5 so fucking loud
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:27:46 sounds like a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:28:45 wedges
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:29:03 like a sideways wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:31:03 I thinking of doing a ace combat 3 stream tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:31:18 if I can get It to work
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:31:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:31:58 both
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:32:02 I think
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:32:54 I'm gonna go to bead now
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:32:58 nice stream
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:34:07 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:10:57 who?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:11:13 what aircraft did he make?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:11:55 did he make gripens?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:12:30 glad he got banned
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:14:30 jaguar is lame
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:14:54 f-117 is pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:15:16 the have blue?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:04 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:11 have blue is nice looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:38 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:41 did you?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:17:14 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:18:14 you aren't funny
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:18:30 I've seen this joke like 3 different times today
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:19:14 gayguar
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:19:48 jajajayuar
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:20:54 imagine not playing with uhjk
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:21:34 10 second turnrate sounds pretty slow
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:21:54 in game tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:22:21 that's how it was in neo warfare
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:22:34 it's how I play it in pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:24:08 most of mine are like 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:24:30 sounds impractical
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:25:15 having a fast turnrate becomes useless at like 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:25:33 I have a plane that go 1000 speed and turn 180's within half a second
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:25:41 it's near impossible to control
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:27:02 
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:27:09 a really old screenshot of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:27:50 the skyhawk could go mach 3 irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:27:58 you should make it more accurate
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:28:03 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:28:17 I think it actually could
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:28:44 most my planes go like 400
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:29:05 they become to unstable at speeds above that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:29:31 the sea harrier could also go supersonic in a dive
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:29:41 earliest model harriers
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:30:13 1034 is just under mach 3
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:30:20 so I was wrong
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:30:38 I think it's just a bit above supersonic
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:31:09 my planes start shaking like crazy at 500
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:29 I might download roblox on my phone and join
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:33 give me a hour
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:33:15 that sounds awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:33:26 most my planes stall at like 60
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:33:54 most my planes are like flying wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:34:01 so I have a lot of wing panals
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:34:13 helps a lot at low speeds
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:34:43 why?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:35:06 sounds like a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:35:14 I have no problem with motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:37:34 I use a fuck ton of wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:38:09 the only problem with having a load of wings is how long it takes for me to stall to the ground
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:38:44 my black biplane thing I posted takes like 30 seconds to reach the ground
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:51:01 how the hell do people play plane crazy on mobile
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:51:15 I just got a headache trying to play it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:51:38 I can't even place a block
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:51:49 deleting doesn't work half the time
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:52:11 reset
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:52:44 who are you people?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:53:06 birds taste pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:53:09 you should try some
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:53:28 <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:54:31 what do gelb fly?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:54:36 I can't remember
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:55:08 I keep confusing them with grun
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:55:29 who are the flat earth guys?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:55:47 3 squadrons with g in their name
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:55:59 how am I supposed to remember this shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:56:27 there's 24 letters in the alphabet
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:56:37 and they chose g 3 times
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:57:05 isn't grabacr the s-32's?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:57:56 Gault team has some really good music
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:59:44 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:00:39 the chin air intake with double engines is pretty odd
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:00:46 I haven't seen that before
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:01:34 it's a canopy
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:01:38 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:01:57 the glass part
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:02:58 the engines look pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:03:11 I like the use of hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:23:05 arkbird cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:23:17 UI-4053 Sphyrna based
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:28:37 you're taking about those moving platforms with a fuck ton of weapons
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:28:40 right?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:31:07 I had to deal with two of those in the last server I was in
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:32:05 I couldn't even take off on the base plate
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:33:24 you would have a unstable mess
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:44:21 why wouldn't they work in pc2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:51:50 why is the first picture ww2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:52:59 not much of a bait and switch
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:55:07 it has the lyrics above the bait and switch
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 15:55:35 very little bait
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:01:26 plane crazy has official private servers?
creations-chat 2021-11-09 16:16:25 usually a year
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:19:56 I don't think so
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:20:41 just to "negotiate" with protesters

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:22:53 they  brought those tanks because of a fucking protest
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:23:04 I don't think they care about running over somebody

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:42:01 doesn't sound very stable
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:42:15 probably
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:42:34 you keep using the word fuming
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:42:43 do you even know what that means?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:48:00 sounds like you're under 13 as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 17:50:30 I said the exact same thing when I was 12 and I was trying to leave a argument
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 19:15:48 I may have made a mistake
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 19:16:21 are you guys still arguing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 19:16:59 has a mod come in yet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:10:44 it's definitely a mil mi-24
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:13:16 working on some fancy pusher props
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:13:57 basing it off of this
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:18:36 FEP-1 ACC
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:18:54 it's from Yukikaze
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:27:14 it's glitchy as fuck
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:39:08 <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:39:11 scroll up a bit
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:39:36 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:48:19 the aircraft it self looks awful but the propeller works
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:48:41 that's the only thing that matters to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:54:17 it was supposed to be counter rotating curved propellers
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 20:54:26 like the arsenal bird
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:33:54 
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:34:10 loosely based off of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:34:17 based off of this
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:34:53 the vertical stabilizers control roll
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:36:34 I'm thinking of making a more accurate version of it whenever I figure out how to make a sphere
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:40:22 make the brown darker
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:41:23 give me a second
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:42:02 95 45 5
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:42:31 that's a pretty good color
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:43:04 darken the sails just a bit
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 23:43:08 it looks like they're glowing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:27:54 Sukhoi air intakes?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:31:49 pretty good looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:31:59 what Sukhoi is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:39:01 I actually had a pretty good PvP experience today
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:39:06 first time in 3 months
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:37 the main thing I dislike about PvP are cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:48:00 seeing cutters on anything just pisses me off
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:48:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:48:36 I've used them in noses and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:49:24 alt f4 to clear lag
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:50:02 it lets you download memory and CPU power
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:00 cutters are just a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:05 I was attacking a airship earlier with a mini shinden biplane thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:21 and that asshole stuck cutters everywhere on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:47 I lost my nose and canards
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:01 I was still flying somehow
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:22 default plane a-10
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:53:12 They better make the controls better in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:53:29 using mouse controls on anything just gives me a headache
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:13 when I first joined a pvp server today there were like 3 shredders
and one of them was a like 4 mini shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:23 looks cute
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:42 what's with the wing tip vertical stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:56:08 it kinda looks like a uav
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:57:19 I can barely pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:57:28 at least in a plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:57:54 Trying to aim a non-turret gun is a pain
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:58:07 especially with keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:01 ad turning?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:10 yawing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:46 I only use yaw when landing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:54 I just bank
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:01:05 it just feels better
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:02:02 I hope in pc2 they make yawing and banking faster
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:02:17 I make a plane with 5 block long wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:02:27 my roll speed is like 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:04:21 I've run out of topics to say
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:05:38 I'm just not skilled enough to make big planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:05:59 all my recent planes have been like the size of the default plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:10:12 I only feel like making planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:10:23 doing anything else just bores me
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:11:43 mechanical stuff sounds like a pain to work on
the-dump 2021-11-13 02:12:06 
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:13:23 what is so confusing about that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:13:42 I'm talking about the motor locking thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:14:40 I'm pretty sure changing the COM effects the stability
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:15:55 why ice?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:16:09 I totally forgot about that
the-dump 2021-11-13 02:17:41 the song is "buttercup" for anybody wondering
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:18:50 it's just a really fast engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:19:53 I think conveyer engines make a aircraft more stable
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:20:04 or that's at least what I heard
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:20:30 is there any other way to make a aircraft more stable?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:21:14 I try to avoid both of those
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:21:20 in almost every build
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:22:13 what the hell am I looking at?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:24:03 should've put the gun where the laser is
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:24:33 what the hell are you doing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:25:34 I tried making a tank using conveyer blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:25:43 I was getting like 5 fps when moving
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:26:17 I had to hit w for a second and stop
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:26:20 and just glide
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:26:34 that's how bad the fps was
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:27:05 what the hell were you doing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:31:53 Plane crazy mobile scares me
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:32:35 I will never understand how people play mobile
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:33:11 It has to be a good build
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:33:53 Its a plane

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:05:47 all 3 angles look the same
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:05:58 not even the turret has moved
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:07:05 the tank turned around
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:07:11 when it saw the tree
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:07:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:07:32 the tank turned around
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:07:39 that's why the tree is behind it

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:23:57 does anybody know if it's possible to create this in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 08:24:10 it's a canard rotor wing aircraft. it's rotor is supposed to stop, twist, and work as wings in forward flight.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:53:35 the mig 27 isn't modern
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:55:50 why would you make a mig 27 without swing wing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:56:21 because that's a main feature of the mig 27
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:59:50 Motors are pretty easy to use
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:00:50 just use motor 2 servo with toggle

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:25:06 I don't think that symbol is circular
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:25:18 you could've just used a motor to turn it

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:24:46 It's supposed to be unstable
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:25:04 The su-47
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:25:14 Most fighters in general are unstable
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:25:53 The Wright plane is the best multirole

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:34:16 What even is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:37:42 Sounds like a pain in the ass to control
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:39:00 It just seems annoying to have to use both a and d just to move forward
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:39:09 Not very ergonomic

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:48:30 I wasn't even talking to you at first
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:48:40 Are you really that dumb?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:54:03 The only time hand held weapons would make sense is with really early ww1 biplanes
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:54:55 Yeah but they weren't shooting at planes with it
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:55:05 The Germans didn't even have shotguns
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:55:11 What are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:56:23 That was a survival shotgun
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:56:41 It's not like they used it in front lime use
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:56:53 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:57:00 As a survival gun
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:57:15 Most pilot's have those
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:57:45 They weren't gonna parachute from their planes and start attacking people
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:57:55 It was just to protect them
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:58:16 And?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:58:24 That's not normal
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:58:56 He probably didn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:59:10 He's can stand
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 04:59:20 It's better for your legs
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:00:08 He has those desk made for standing
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:00:14 But in his plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:00:41 Standing in a fighter jet would probably be a really bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:00:44 Since g forces
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:01:34 Standing in a plane while in a dogfight sounds like a nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:02:22 Those were in bombers and shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:02:32 You don't need to worry about g forces
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:03:20 Already are
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:03:30 Battlefield 4
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:03:36 Or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:04:04 It's the f-35d
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:04:13 It has extra space for rocket launchers

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:06:26 It better be true
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:07:10 Are you telling be that a """ low" "" flyby from the f-18 isn't cool anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:07:35 I miss the days when su-27's could hit the crowd at airshows
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:07:56 It made it more interesting
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:09:33 
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:09:48 Really helps show how big the su-27 is
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:10:44 They needed extra practice but they weren't given any
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:11:28 I've seen that vid like 20 times

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:15:19 War crimes have lost their meaning now
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:15:50 Those yellow targets are helping belka
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:15:57 Almost all of them
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:16:06 It's not a war crime to bomb them
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:16:30 They shouldn't have been belkan then
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:18:15 So realistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:19:00 Yeahj

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:21:43 It's never implied
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:21:50 That's just a myth
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:22:02 If you think about it
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:22:22 All ace combat protags are nemo
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:22:34 The best pilot in the series
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:22:56 Ac5 is overrated
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:23:40 There's better ace combat games
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:24:04 2 and 3 are better
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:24:29 "" story ""
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:25:01 I can't even remember 2's story
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:25:11 3 has a good story though
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:25:27 3 and 7 have the most interesting storys
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:25:53 I didn't way it was good

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:27:49 I saw some gameplay of ace combat 6 a few years ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:28:10 That's what got me interested
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:28:32 Psm is just dumb
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 05:29:20 Being able to cobra is the only move you should be able to do

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:28:12 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:28:24 I was wondering if he meant purple man
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:29:31 I went to the fnaf Reddit a week ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:29:35 Just for nostalgia
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:29:48 Absolute shit show
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:30:05 Apparently the creator did some bad stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:30:12 I didn't read that far im

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:30:31 A sentence in
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:30:54 I realised it had something to do with politics
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:30:57 And ran

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:38:01 It's just twitter being assholes
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:40:19 Has anybody made the cl-1201 yet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:40:54 Make it 1:1 scale
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:42:00 They better make the plot size bigger in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:45:02 The Beriev Be-2500 would be a pretty cooI plane to build
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:45:51 I tried it once when I first started
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:45:59 But it went to shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:46:58 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:47:14 Imagine having 1:1 scale aircraft carriers in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:47:44 They better make the plot size way bigger
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:48:02 Builds can load in way faster now
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:48:22 So I don't see why they can't make the plot bigger
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 06:49:54 The game is gonna be better optimized

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:53:12 What even is a fulcrum
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:53:47 But why give the 29 that name
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:54:01 I thought fulcrum was a bird or.something
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:54:32 The best NATO name has to be the flankers
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:54:39 Just sounds cooler
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 17:55:02 Isn't the hustler a American bomber?

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:50:34 must be some curse or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:51:11 every mod gets infected with the sickness of not doing their job

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:56:48 why not just use powered motors?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:58:03 there's no point in using rockets for that
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:58:25 It's ugly and serves no purpose
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:58:48 are you having some torque problem or something?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 07:59:52 are you ever you ever gonna give your reasoning for using rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:00:09 it looks like you were gonna say something

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:24:48 wait
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:24:59 are you using those props for propulsion?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:25:22 who the hell does that
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:25:51 just hide hover engines inside the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:26:09 and have the props be decorative
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:27:47 didn't know Germany was using digital camo on their planes back in the 1940's
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:29:48 since when has Germany ever be right?
except 1943
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:30:36 as they should be
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:31:11 make it scramjet powered
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:31:29 it'll be more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:32:55 the g4m2 has a scramjet engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:33:00 what are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:33:23 the props have scramjet tips
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:34:04 me? are you a fucking German?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:34:39 they allow the aircraft to to at hypertrans sonic speeds
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:37:07 rockets existed before v2, Germany didn't have that many advance aircraft besides the me 262 or what ever it's called
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:37:39 are you sure that's not a German plane?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 08:37:47 the props tell me otherwise
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:40:13 most of Germanys "advance" aircraft were just paper planes
It's only slightly better then me making up a hypersonic space-fighter jet that fires plasma beams
they did not invent space travel
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:42:14 the me263 was not that advance

I may be talking out of my ass
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:44:26 I didn't know Germany was made up by only Von Braun
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:46:26 disgusting

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:00:49 what rocket?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:01:03 the weapon or the form of propulsion?

<@721103577380159490>  america used German rocket scientist when working on the Saturn v and stuff
creations-chat 2021-11-16 09:20:30 I don't need proof, he called me and told me that the fbi is after him and that he had to delete his account
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:21:25 that looks stable and safe
creations-chat 2021-11-16 09:22:49 imagine eating hotdogs

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:36:31 it would look so cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:37:12 despite how much of a disaster the f2y was
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:37:24 pontoons?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:38:11 
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:38:23 would actually be pretty easy to build
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:44:09 found the original concept
creations-chat 2021-11-16 09:44:41 it's slightly higher effort pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:45:31 Heavy-lift reusable space vehicle  drawn by Roy Kerswill
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:45:41 at least that's what reddit says
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:50:54 came across this when trying to find some more context for that rocket thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:51:55 a huge ass helicopter made to move rocket thrusters

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:54:41 but I forgot
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 09:55:31 I was just wanting to see how those werid hybrid vertical stabilizer canard things would work

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 18:56:05 I think the mig 1.44 looks cooler
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 18:56:12 so it wins
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 19:00:29 it was meant to
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 19:00:38 it never was stealthy
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 19:11:32 dead chat
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 19:11:44 * dies of cringe *
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 22:40:37 motorlocking is a lot easier then I thought it would be

plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:01:26 came across this dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:01:28 
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:02:14 that brainlit was flying a slightly modified default plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:02:23 and was trying to insult my bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:03:06 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:09:25 he was saying my bomber was bad because it had no guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:09:35 and said that every bomber had a gunner
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:09:38 it made no sense
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:09:55 I forgot
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:09:58 the b2 had a tailgunner
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:13 pointed that out
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:21 gunners are usless now
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:57 dude
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:00 this isn't cod
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:08 you aren't gonna be shooting down a missile
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:18 we need to replace tailgunners
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:26 and add ciws
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:30 or what every carriers use
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:11:37 it's those things that shoot down missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:12:39 this was the bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:12:41 it's shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:12:48 but not because it doesn't have a tailgunner
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:13:11 it's such a pain to fly
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:13:46 it was designed around a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:47:04 the xfa-24 is a better choice
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:47:54 what is that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:48:23 it looks like you gave a ww2 prop plane a jet air intake
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:48:40 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:49:04 going off of my vague memory of what the avenger looks like

plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:50:16 looks nothing like it
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:51:10 it haw canards and a tailless" delta wing
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:51:28 that's it
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 06:51:48 you could compare it to like 8 other aircraft

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:31:44 I guess that's impressive
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:32:15 I question if those nukes are even fueled
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:33:05 don't insult the u.s like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:33:28 we spend 99.8% of our money on the military

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:37:36 Vietnam has some nice looking su-30's
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:38:02 mkm for me
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:38:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:38:36 the Chinese Verizon is the only version without canards
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:38:43 going off of memory
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:39:36 I think the j-16 is different
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:39:42 it's like a copy of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:39:47 
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:40:00 better camo in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:40:11 it's not cgi
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:40:19 it was a mockup
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:40:33 the cgi in stealth wasn't that good
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:40:59 love that camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:41:09 all su-30's should be painted like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:41:47 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:41:48 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:41:55 that was a different aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:42:15 it was some 80's movie that did that
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:42:46 SA-43
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:42:55 this is what confused  the country's
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:43:34 they are backwards in every way
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:43:47 all fighters
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:44:01 I think attack aircraft are even numbers
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:44:27 looks more like a su-33 from behind
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:45:16 what country?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:45:55 I think they stopped using them
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:46:30 That's what most people think about when they hear Vietnam
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:47:00 I feel bad for your air force
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:47:17 having to buy gripens

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:48:19 what the hell is tailoring?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:48:54 didn't expect Vietnam to be the Capitol of that
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:49:34 at least it can move
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:49:44 I guess that's a plus
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:50:11 Vietnam's climate sounds awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:50:43 it always seemed hot and humid
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:52:29 looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:52:51 water is extremely blue looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 03:52:55 odd to see

creations-chat 2021-11-19 05:32:55 at least it'll be useful
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:34:23 There's no mercy in war. People piss and people shit. That's all there is to it.
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:35:42 You and I are opposite sides of the same cheek.
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:36:50 fart away, coward!
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:38:37 When we piss in front each other, we can finally see our true selves.There may be a resemblance, but we never use the same urinal
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:39:12 yo buddy, still pissing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:42:14 Too bad, Buddy. This twisted toilet needs to be reset. We'll start over from "zero" with this shit 2 and entrust the bathroom to the next generation.
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:44:58 switching to ac7
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:45:25 he shat all over it with his dirty cheeks ! Over the crisp, white sheets of my bed that I had just made!
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:45:50 I can't think of anymore ac0 lines
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:46:50 The world shall be horrified by the number of shits we will take.

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:51:38 ace combat 2 has awful physics
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:51:50 the aircraft are weightless
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:53:10 The toilet won't change unless we trust people. Trust is vital for a clean bathroom
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:53:48 it looks like we live to shit another day. cipher

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 05:58:30 Did you know... there are three kinds of shitters? Those who seek noise? Those who live for the smell. And those who can read the tide of toilet bowl. Those are the three.
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 06:02:44 eat my square explosions!

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 07:13:05 the names he comes up with as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 07:13:38 Dragon fighter sounds like the name of a clip art fighter jet

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:39:26 isn't the f-2 used mostly for anti ship?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:40:42 I forgot how much I hated the jsdf blue color scheme for the f-2
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:40:52 such a ugly shade of blue
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:42:20 it's a plot size circle
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:42:34 couldn't you have made it smoother?
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:43:56 it looks like a su-37
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:44:33 
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:44:52 it's flat on the real thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 09:45:14 what color do you plan on making it?

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 10:04:36 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 10:06:58 click right

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:43:29 weakest excuse I have ever heard
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:46:24 I don't think I've ever seen such garbage builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:47:16 who would put their guns so far from the center
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:48:23 but it's a single gun
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:48:34 so you're not even doing that much damage when you do hit
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:49:01 having that much spread is useless
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:51:15 most meme builds are shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:52:35 *most*
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:52:46 there are exceptions

plane-crazy 2021-11-19 21:33:18 biggest mistake of my life
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:26:28 I was having some weeks problems with pc early
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:27:39 What materiel were you going to use for your fighter?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:27:50 It was it glass or ice?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:28:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:28:37 It was for invisibility or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 00:31:08 I thought you were using ice to make the aircraft semi transparent or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:26:04 finally have a semi functioning helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:27:57 I thought those bombs were pontoons for a second
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:28:10 or some kind of ski
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:31:30 warthog is overrated
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:31:59 scorpion
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:33:40 imagine taking showers

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:35:34 does anybody have any ideas on how to get this thing to propel forward?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:36:16 I'm trying to make a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:36:26 why would I convert it into a jet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:36:57 those aren't true helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:37:08 I'm trying to make a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:37:14 that flys like a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:39:29 
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:39:54 tilting the whole rotor kinda works
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:40:32 it should
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:41:02 I'm only turning because of a slight torque my helicopter has
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:41:05 I don't know why it even has it
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:43:37 what is it called?
\
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:44:42 gonna try and make the helicopter heavier
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:44:54 might help with tilting the rotor
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:46:23 I thought it was from Space Battleship Yamato I just wasn't sure what fighter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:48:11 and roblox crashed
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:50:54 the motor is unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:51:04 I'm using only jets to move the rotor
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:53:39 wait another 5
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:53:40 years
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 03:55:33 I give up my helicopter

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:44:54 what the fuck is that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:45:17 it's not even a plane anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:45:25 it's just flying motorlock

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:56:42 that's a very bad flying wing bomber

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:09:36 why is the section above the air intake a different color?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:10:16 the parts that curves down
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:10:46 that's not a aileron
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:11:10 flaps?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:11:58 I'm talking about this
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:12:14 why did you shade it grey?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:12:36 why is the white so dark as well?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:13:18 because it looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:14:21 that nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:14:59 what's with the camo?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:15:21 I thought it was a weird version of the s-70 camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:15:58 
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:16:08 this is the pattern I was talking about
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:17:10 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:17:33 looks like a su-35
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:17:49 I've never seen a su-33 with camo like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:20:04 avro arrow?

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:33:35 they all look the same

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:37:15 his video's get really popular
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:37:37 and a lot of his videos get seen by plane crazy players

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:31:04 yeah, you just can't say slurs (sadly) and a couple of other small words
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:31:21 embed fail
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:31:41 it isn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:32:00 how is it the best jet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:32:27 congrats
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:32:35 you just described the f-15
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:33:09 and since when did the f-4 have good handling?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:33:16 it was to stable for it's own good
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:34:08 it needs tilt jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:34:20 so it can vtol
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:34:56 and plasma stealth?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:35:34 that's not plasma stealth
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:35:41 1/10 you tried
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:35:44 and failed
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:36:07 but can you make it lta?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:36:25 lighter then air
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:37:44 can it submerge underwater as well?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:38:09 not a very good fighter if it can't
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:38:27 it also needs ion thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:38:34 a real thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:39:04 can it also carrier smaller drone aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:39:08 pretty lame if it can't
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:39:17 not a very good multirole
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:39:50 can it deploy anti satellite missiles?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:40:45 ngl
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:40:51 you're pretty shit at the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:41:41 pretty cringe
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:42:00 strategic bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:42:15 what do you need help with?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:42:22 it's not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:42:43 3 1x7 next to each other
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:42:57 2 1x4 wing panels on the front
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:43:26 put control surfaces behind those wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:43:43 you don't need a wheel
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:43:51 turn on "arm on key"
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:43:56 for the bombs
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:44:09 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:44:42 it's not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:45:42 the roll
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:45:45 oh my god
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:45:52 10 second roll speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:46:22 I've never seen a biplane glider
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:46:57 it only looks like a glider because of its long wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:47:13 for the xfa-27?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:47:31 do you have a reference image?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:48:05 I guess it works
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:48:32 the wing tip is a bit thin
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:48:38 and short
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:48:58 airship?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:49:07 that's a very odd looking balloon
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:49:56 stop what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:50:33 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:51:31 the wing tip thing just looks to thin
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:51:43 the part that indents
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:53:37 working on a su-27?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:02:20 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:05:25 where did you even get this?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:05:57 it's awful edit
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:06:19 I want more
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:06:24 I desire more
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:08:17 that's real
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:08:24 it was a actual project
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:08:51 is there any more?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:09:08 f-16sfw
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:09:19 no joke
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:09:32 it was in a competition with the x-29
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:10:36 I'm thinking of making a Morgan edit with swept back wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:11:05 the b2 is already unstable as it is
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:11:16 it doesn't need foward swept wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:11:42 I don't think it could even fly because of how unstable it would be
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:13:47 what about morgans?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:14:58 I forgor
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:18:33 speaking of tanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:19:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:20:31 pee 2013?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:21:18 su-57 camo looks good on anything
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:22:24 would probably look like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:22:37 that's what it is supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:23:05 no it isn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:23:11 it just has a similar nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:23:48 the ace combat wiki isn't always right
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:24:05 and the pzl-230 isn't that well known of a plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:24:13 it was just a wood mockup
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:24:32 this would look better
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:25:56 since when?
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:26:24 and location
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:26:39 it should be moved back
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:29:38 add glepnhir stealth
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:30:34 needs a bit more ui-4053
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:32:35 they can sweep forward as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:35:48 export version of the su-35
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:36:03 earliest version

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:53:45 there is a actual aircraft called that
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:53:54 it never got built
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:54:02 but it was a concept
creations-chat 2021-11-22 02:56:00 just use vertical control surfaces

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 04:30:53 some export version of the su-27 had canards
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 04:31:00 it it was called the su-35 for a while

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:08:46 it was stealth as well

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:22:28 the aircraft is called the su-37u super flanker

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:25:02 you mean canopy?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:25:10 even though it doesn't have one
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:25:29 no they aren't
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:25:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:26:15 are you telling me this looks futuristic?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:26:16 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:26:25 looks normal to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:05 in 1998
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:10 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:12 it's after
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:26 2040
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:30 like really far after
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:45 and it's great
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:27:56 ac2 planes had some really nice skins
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:28:32 how else would they make it look futuristic?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:28:54 do you except all new planes for the whole game?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:29:03 that doesn't make much sense for ace combat
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:29:24 it's set in 2040
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:29:36 only 20 years later
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:29:48 the game had new planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:30:49 it had new planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:31:37 there's almost more new planes in ace combat 3 then old ones
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:32:34 the a-10 is (probably) gonna be in service by the 2040's
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:33:38 it looks like a worse adf-01
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:35:16 why do you even care about the aircraft having coffins?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:35:32 there's like 6-7 new aircraft in ac3
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:35:56 not everybody wants into play as this
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:36:08 so having some older planes makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:36:24 the planes are at least semi modified
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:36:33 what would they add?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:37:01 it's a 90's game
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:37:14 nobody would care about the engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:37:24 nobody would even notice
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:38:08 and?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:38:24 they added 2 new aircraft in ac2
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:38:35 have you seen any of the new aircraft in ac3?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:39:22 there's over 7 new aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:39:51 I'm just repeating myself at this point
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:43:34 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:27:28 this would actually be a pretty good turret for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:27:50 just camp underwater
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:28:06 the only thing that could attack you would be a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:28:13 and most people don't have those
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:28:40 the hardest part would probably just be aiming

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:43:50 I will never be beaten in PvP
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:44:21 I was just thinking of a turret
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 07:44:24 underwater

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:02:57 yo obc
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:03:28 are you taking about just saying "funny windmill" or saying the actual word
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:03:33 I'm talking about your suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:03:51 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:03:56 I was worried for a second
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:04:09 I shocked

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:07:50 you know
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:07:55 the thing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:10:35 just add a fuck ton of guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:10:48 if you're going straight
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:10:56 it can kinda look like a laser
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:11:17 they're usually pretty close

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:20:07 I'm hoping they add it again for the next winter event
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:20:12 assuming there is one
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:20:24 epic
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:20:53 hopefully I don't quit plane crazy before the next winter event
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:21:40 I know a good way to stop him

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:24:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:24:22 great grammar, dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:25:06 common knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:25:21 like the Germany's being on the moon
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:25:40 what even is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:26:42 what even is it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:30:14 it's literally just some fancy trick
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:30:26 it would make no sense for inventors
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:33:36 why is the camo blue?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:34:04 exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:34:29 why?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:35:08 I don't think there's a single su-27 derivative with internal weapons bay
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:35:24 unless you count the su-47 as a su-27 derivative
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:35:37 have you seen the su-37?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:36:16 it's a yellow and brown paint scheme
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:36:21 not blue
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:37:25 and?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:37:36 it's reference
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:37:44 why give it a different camo color?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:39:19 I just pointed out how it was odd for the su-37 in that image to have a light blue paint despite the fact the su-37 never did
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 08:39:27 what are you so questioning?

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:53:16 I forgot I already argued with you about this
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:53:33 you're still wrong
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:54:16 that was never my argument
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:54:29 facts don't care about your feelings

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:57:59 what version of the xfa-27 is it based on?
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:58:16 I have more gendo shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:58:23 so keep your mouth shut
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 10:58:57 I'm talking about what reference
the xfa-27 slightly changes appearance in different games
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:01:19 the biggest difference between the versions is the nose and canopy
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:01:26 they get thinner like every game
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:01:57 I'm not joking
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:02:00 I have more
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:02:24 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:03:10 I have projected myself on to Gendo
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:03:19 I'm just like him
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:03:21 100%
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:04:23 I saw that
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:04:43 not very subtle
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:06:03 I don't remember the cannon being so green
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:07:46 I stand correct
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:07:51 it's not that green
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:09:27 from some of the images I've seen it's blue
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:09:41 like Russian cockpit blue
the-dump 2021-11-24 11:10:44 relatable
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:15:17 are you gonna post a image every time you add a block?

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 07:04:27 using helium and ballast blocks can effect the way the plane behaves

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:46:18 the ucav looks more like a crushed rq-180 or s-70
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:47:43 h-20?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:47:47 the Chinese bomber?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:47:56 dude
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:48:16 I think the h-20 came after the x-47
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:48:42 they could pretty easily make a stealth bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:48:55 just copy the b2
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:49:11 looks nothing a like
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:49:56 the h-20 hasn't even been made yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:50:14 why are you comparing it to the x-47?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:50:24 I'm talking to the other guy
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:51:44 ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:51:57 x is used for American aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:52:00 not Chinese
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:52:27 nah
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:53:32 everybody is but the u.s
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:54:02 Russia is the only other country that is working on a stealth bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:54:14 and there's almost nothing about it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:55:10 3rd?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:55:23 are you including the f-117 in that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:56:24 I don't know if the b-21 has even taken off yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:58:30 I can't believe the Russians copied the f-22
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:58:35 they're so similar
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:58:42 they're both aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:59:01 they have radar
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 08:59:09 such a obvious copy
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:00:11 no
creations-chat 2021-11-25 09:00:59 that doesn't mean your plane doesn't look like ass
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:01:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:01:52 that doesn't be mean it's gonna be a better production aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:02:46 it really isn't
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:03:15 the f-22 is a better aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:04:17 the final version of the yf-23 would've been worse then the prototype
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:05:09 you have to cut cost when mass producing a aircraft
creations-chat 2021-11-25 09:06:31 right next to each other irl

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:07:40 yes

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:47:45 have none of you heard of it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:48:22 it's the early version of the f-117
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:48:55 that rotor
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:49:04 make the blades longer

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:53:23 I wish you luck with that
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:53:35 sounds like it'll be a pain
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:54:27 it's a pretty small aircraft as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:54:48 it's what I thought the f-117 would've looked like in size
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:55:21 
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:55:36 the f-117 is huge
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:56:35 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:56:40 common knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:57:01 the f-117 could launch air to air missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:57:11 it never happened though
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:57:43 the f-117 could carry most missile and bombs they had at the time
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:57:50 so it probably could
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:57:57 looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:58:32 
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:58:56 the canards could be longer
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:59:20 the wings also look thicker
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 09:59:56 how do you plan on doing the downwards angled wingtips?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:01:19 I forgot how badass the xfa-33 looks
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:01:30 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:01:39 one of the biggest Super planes in ace combat
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:01:54 what?

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:06:48 the 3 engines are definitely gonna be hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:07:15 do you plan on making that one tilt down?

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:17:43 I don't think anybody has done the yak-130 yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:18:07 I think the yak-130 can use weapons
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:18:35 it's also a light combat aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:18:42 so it's a attacker
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:18:57 I think it's for the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:19:01 or missiles

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:24:08 the su-75 hasn't flown yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:24:14 what are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:24:47 it's a light aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:25:00 that's all you need to say
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:25:25 I just gave you a aircraft you could build
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:25:47 there's also a two seater version

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:56:40 the xfa-33 uses coffin
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 10:57:01

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:01:08 almost every aircraft canopy sticks out
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:02:29 the xfa-33's canopy barley sticks out
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:02:55 that's not how the xfa-33's canopy looks like
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:03:13 the f-22 is the only aircraft to ever exist
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:03:19 apparently
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:03:33 not even close
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:04:05 a very slight bump
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:05:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 11:07:30 I've been thinking of 3d modeling it

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:38:00 even if they were they'd probably have a parachute
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:38:16 so there's nothing to worry about

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:53:42 just use a transport heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:53:46 it's just useless
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 09:54:16 at least the harrier exnit pod had a bit of logic to it

plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:53:53 the rotor angle though is gonna make it hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:54:12 won't be gaining much lift
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:54:31 I've worked on helicopters before
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:55:04 it's not complex
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:55:41 motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:55:55 that's pointless
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:57:05 why would you need it for the helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:57:17 at least the rotor system
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:57:39 it's not hard to tilt the rotor without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:58:08 it's not hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:58:45 what?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:58:54 speak basic English
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:59:42 it's practically just gonna be the rotor
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 10:59:49 ane maybe a brick for a body
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 11:03:27 can we stop allowing foreigners into this server?
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 11:03:33 it would be pretty epic

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:06:38 it won't help a whole bunch
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:06:53 people stopped posting builds like a week before as well
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:07:23 why?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:07:36 bruh

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:11:04 people were posting less and less nearing the deadline
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:11:25 I doubt people were gonna just look at a single creation and not scroll up

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:22:39 it also was mainly a mig 21
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:23:05 it being iconic doesn't mean it looks better
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:23:29 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 11:23:43 it would just look like a yellow circle

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:52:48 odd shade of blue
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 02:53:05 but from what I can tell it's pretty accurate

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:21:18 is that supposed to be the x-43?

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:22:26 scramjets don't work well at low speeds
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:22:53 so it had to use a rocket to boost it self up to like mach 6
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:23:07 ramjets also don't work at low speeds
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:23:26 sr-72 has a normal jet engine and a scramjet

general 2021-12-16 03:28:58 I was talking to my sister earlier about fighter jets and how I had plans on be coming a aircraft maintenance engineer
general 2021-12-16 03:29:05 and she just went full anti-war nut on me
general 2021-12-16 03:29:32 she called the army a terrorist organization
general 2021-12-16 03:30:07 I told her fighter jets aren't mainly for killing people
general 2021-12-16 03:30:58 she brought up 9/11
general 2021-12-16 03:31:02 out of no where
general 2021-12-16 03:31:12 when I was showing off my model planes
general 2021-12-16 03:31:29 she just got fired
general 2021-12-16 03:31:35 and had to move
general 2021-12-16 03:31:45 she's insane
general 2021-12-16 03:31:59 talking to her feels like talking to a brickwall
general 2021-12-16 03:32:08 she really seems out of it
general 2021-12-16 03:32:19 like every time I talk to her
general 2021-12-16 03:32:35 older
general 2021-12-16 03:32:41 she's like 22-23
general 2021-12-16 03:32:47 I've completely forgotten
general 2021-12-16 03:33:57 my mom thinks the atomic bombings were war crimes
general 2021-12-16 03:34:56 maybe it shouldn't have been dropped

general 2021-12-17 03:40:01 it has canards
general 2021-12-17 03:40:14 a tailless delta
general 2021-12-17 03:40:20 and two vertical stabilizers
general 2021-12-17 03:40:37 nothing else
general 2021-12-17 03:41:06 you know nothing about aircraft then
general 2021-12-17 03:41:17 if you think that looks similar
general 2021-12-17 03:42:16 look
general 2021-12-17 03:42:20 it's the j-20
general 2021-12-17 03:42:40 it's not a very original concept
general 2021-12-17 03:43:04 they aren't
general 2021-12-17 03:43:09 yes
general 2021-12-17 03:43:16 mig 1.44 is Russian
general 2021-12-17 03:43:45 you have no logically proof that it's a copy

general 2021-12-17 03:49:06 yo homie
general 2021-12-17 03:49:16 mind explaining?
general 2021-12-17 03:49:54 why the hell does roblox have such a large furry community?
general 2021-12-17 03:50:23 I've seen the same thing on the pf discord server
general 2021-12-17 03:51:00 the lead dev is a furry
general 2021-12-17 03:51:02 no joke
general 2021-12-17 03:51:44 maybe furrys play roblox because it has lots of children in it
general 2021-12-17 03:52:03 just a theory
general 2021-12-17 03:52:14 purely hypothetical
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 03:52:57 I was mocking hars doing the same thing
general 2021-12-17 03:53:31 it's only similaritys are that it has canards and it has a tailless delta
general 2021-12-17 03:53:54 it's not the truth
general 2021-12-17 03:54:40 proofl
general 2021-12-17 03:54:44 proof?
general 2021-12-17 03:55:05 what would even be the point in copying it?
general 2021-12-17 03:55:26 the 1.44 wasn't exactly a good aircraft
general 2021-12-17 03:55:37 I already know what you're talking about
general 2021-12-17 03:55:42 it's weak proof
general 2021-12-17 03:56:12 because that's the main argument I hear
general 2021-12-17 03:56:37 people call the j-20 a copy because it "looks" like the 1.44
general 2021-12-17 03:57:44 you guys are sleeping on the best mig
general 2021-12-17 03:58:57 it has almost nothing in common besides being a delta wing and having canards
general 2021-12-17 03:59:10 it would make no sense to use that as their starting point
general 2021-12-17 04:00:05 there were already concepts for delta wing-canard stealth aircraft before the 1.44
general 2021-12-17 04:00:20 based
general 2021-12-17 04:00:40 what about the viggen?
general 2021-12-17 04:00:52 I'm talking about stealth aircraft
general 2021-12-17 04:01:29 you have no argument
general 2021-12-17 04:01:39 you're literally going off of nothing
general 2021-12-17 04:01:43 I already have
general 2021-12-17 04:02:01 I already have
general 2021-12-17 04:02:13 there's no logically argument for it
general 2021-12-17 04:02:19 you have nothing
general 2021-12-17 04:02:21 give up
general 2021-12-17 04:03:21 but why the 1.44?
general 2021-12-17 04:03:32 it's a unsuccessful design
general 2021-12-17 04:03:42 it went nowhere for multiple reasons
general 2021-12-17 04:04:05 already 5 other aircraft with that configuration
general 2021-12-17 04:04:43 what?
general 2021-12-17 04:05:07 
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:05:52 tacit blue was awful
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:06:07 worst looking aircraft I've ever seen
general 2021-12-17 04:06:35 I know about this
general 2021-12-17 04:06:39 I already said I did
general 2021-12-17 04:07:27 not every aircraft needs to be based off of something
general 2021-12-17 04:07:40 though it's probably based on the f-35
general 2021-12-17 04:07:46 maybe a bit f-22
general 2021-12-17 04:08:54 >literally a 2 engine f-35 cone
general 2021-12-17 04:09:08 are you sure you picked the right image?
general 2021-12-17 04:09:24 that's the fc-31
general 2021-12-17 04:09:30 not the j-20
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:10:13 bv-111
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:10:28 it's ugly
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:10:31 stop talking about it
general 2021-12-17 04:11:02 it's that one Turkish 5thgen fighter thing
general 2021-12-17 04:11:11 it looks more like a yf-22
general 2021-12-17 04:11:40 I'm mainly talking about the wing
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:11:54 your mom

plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:09:49 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:11:02 what?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:11:49 I just want to know what boat it's based on
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:14:17 bigger your aircraft is the more stable it is
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:14:24 I think
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:15:24 bigger a aircraft is the more wing area it'll need to fly
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:15:30 so I'm still right
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:16:51 the su-75's wings are that bug
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:17:18 what?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:18:13 this is a disgrace to the su-37
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:19:14 protogen pfp
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:20:15 what does a protogen pilot even mean?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:20:37 I sure do wonder why he's single
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:21:04 probably unsolvable

general 2021-12-27 10:09:21 it's a sr-71 in front of a awacs aircraft
general 2021-12-27 10:09:48 perspective makes it look like it's a sr-71 with a rotodome
general 2021-12-27 10:10:00 I haven't have bacon in years
general 2021-12-27 10:10:27 probably wouldn't
general 2021-12-27 10:10:47 that rotodome would add a incredible amount of drag
general 2021-12-27 10:10:53 and slow it down
general 2021-12-27 10:11:31 that f-14 would probably be the safest
general 2021-12-27 10:11:36 it has actually weapons
general 2021-12-27 10:12:05 I also doubt that sr-71 could even go mach 1 without it's rotodome failing off
general 2021-12-27 10:13:17 probably
general 2021-12-27 10:13:34 the drag it would add would also likely damage it
general 2021-12-27 10:13:43 simply from going too fast
general 2021-12-27 10:14:00 come on man

plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:13:40 something the size of the v-22 has a landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:14:20 why would a vtol need a skid for snow?

the-dump 2022-01-20 10:16:43 kinda a odd channel to be posting this
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:18:09 I'm pretty sure skids wouldn't stop it from slipping
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:18:28 and most aircraft aren't going very fast when taxing
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:18:35 so they wouldn't need to worry
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 10:18:45 why would a vtol even need to taxi?

plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:30:09 the nuclear reactor is one of the problems
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:30:27 weight
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:30:46 it was going to use 100's of 747 engines to take off
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:30:58 to vertically take off
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:31:12 instead of just making a custom runway
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:32:03 it's main engines were supposed to be hypersonic
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:32:21 that's what I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:33:28 joe mama
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:33:50 no?
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:34:11 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:34:22 but it isn't anything like the cl-1201
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:34:32 besides the fact it can carry cargo
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:34:39 it really isn't
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:35:00 it's engines would be impossible
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:35:23 no amount of money can solve it
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:35:52 jet engines that spin at mach 4+ aren't possible
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:35:56 objectively
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:36:14 they could
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:36:17 just not make it
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:36:24 probably would be a better idea
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:36:46 we need to go back to nuclear ramjets
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:37:40 nuclear jet engines work
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:37:52 they've already tested them back in like the 50-70's
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:38:27 they didn't
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:38:43 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:39:04 it was a nuclear powered cruise missile
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:39:21 nuclear reactors have been tested on planes
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:39:30 but they never powered the engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:39:47 nothing
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:02 they were just testing if a nuclear reactor could go on a plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:07 reactors are heavy
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:23 and radiation can go through a lot of stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:42 I think the crew died
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:47 due to radiation
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:40:50 later on
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:42:03 project pluto my beloved
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:43:04 you admitted
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:43:26 the nuclear reactor heated air up
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:43:46 and used that as propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:43:55 I wouldn't really say that's a engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:44:21 A nuclear powered rocket is impossible
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:44:35 unless you change what a rocket means
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:44:53 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:45:15 I really don't think you know what you're talking about
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:45:38 what?
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 11:46:44 that's not a rocket

the-dump 2022-01-20 12:28:05 canard placement and size is weird
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:28:27 having canards in general doesn't make.sense
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:29:56 canards are supposed to increase the lift in a certain area
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:30:24 the su-30 has canards because it's nose is heavier
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:31:20 the su-47 has canards because it has a incredible amount of lift in the back
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:31:34 but no lift in the front
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:32:42 canards can add maneuverability
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:33:09 but just slapping them on doesn't make a aircraft maneuverable
general 2022-01-20 12:34:45 engine 4
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:36:03 canards aren't solely intended for maneuverability?

the-dump 2022-01-20 12:38:13 it's not a fighter
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:39:12 it has canards because it needs lift in the front since it's wings are placed at the very back of the aircraft
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:41:03 sticking canards onto a f-22 won't automatically make it more maneuverable
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:42:20 canards can't be added on haphazardly
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:43:00 the aircraft needs to be designed with canards in mind
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:43:07 it's not far off
the-dump 2022-01-20 12:44:04 the su-30 has canards because it's front is much heavier then a normal su-27

plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:31:52 that all look the same
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:31:59 it's wing
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:32:12 and propeller
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:32:14 that's it

plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:38:02 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:38:11 it's not mounted the same way
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:39:41 placing it on the bottom also creates drag
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:40:27 the reason they're placed lower is because of maintenance

plane-crazy 2022-01-25 07:42:16 did you post images of it?

plane-crazy 2022-01-25 08:11:32 forward swept wings don't automatically make a aircraft unstable

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:18:17 
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:24:20 forgot to add the motors to angle the blades on the top
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:24:22 what about size?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:24:25 is it too small?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:25:23 because I like coaxial rotors?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:25:30 I'm not trying to make a apache
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:27:05 it's a custom helicopter?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:27:45 who?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:32:10 fucked up the rotors again

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:34:22 what?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:34:38 I was just trying to copy the apache's "rotodome"
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:34:55 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:34:58 most people here have
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:45:28

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:54:51 <@695457559989190686> Too many emojis.
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:56:37 do you guys think a coaxial rotor can work for a autogyro?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:56:46 I'm thinking of adding a prop in the back
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:57:08 you need to  be a rank 3
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:57:18 you just need to talk for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:08:50 if you're using cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:08:56 then you probably are
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:09:25 ironic
the-dump 2022-06-01 19:11:23 I've always wondered if Frankie is a troll
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:19:30 what?
the-dump 2022-06-01 19:31:46 oh wow
the-dump 2022-06-01 19:31:48 you're just that
the-dump 2022-06-01 19:31:59 "special"
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:42:15 is a autogyro even possible?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:42:29 ignore the quality of the design
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:58:01 unstable?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:58:02 what?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:58:03 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:59:04 I tried using a coaxial rotor
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:59:10 but it ended up pitching up non-stop
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:59:18 even when it was at the center of mass
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 20:59:58 motorlock isn't going to help this
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:00:30 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:00:33 doesn't mean it's unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:00:53 the rotor is just causing it to yaw right
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:06:52 zie
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:06:55 read

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:08:29 learn to read
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:08:46 the rotor is unpowered
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:09:17 and is being turned by auto gyration
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:11:04 I'm doing it in the most simple way possible
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:01:01 no?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:01:17 I just tried to make a rushed autogyro
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:05:31 this is all it is
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:05:37 just a unpowered motor and prop
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:12:01 I'm still waiting
the-dump 2022-06-01 22:20:47 bypass <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:38:45 again
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:38:57 still don't know how I'm going to put it on a helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:39:45 one motor is for this
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:40:06 other is for this
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:40:55 imagine
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:40:59 imagine you not talking
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:46:01 managed to get it to fly pretty well
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:47:37 there's a windmill next to me
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:49:20 I managed to get it to fly better on my first try
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:49:27 no idea what I did wrong
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:58:08 gamma
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:58:10 please
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:58:11 shut up
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:58:43 ok gamma
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:58:51 show me how I'd power both rotors like that
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 22:59:59 I'm pretty sure that won't work
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 23:00:33 doing that in the first place won't even do anything either
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 23:00:56 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 23:00:59 but that's not my issue
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:52:48 no shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:54:03 it's a joke, dumbass
