plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:47:09 Im never in the server but can somebody tell me how this never flips?
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:47:43 No ballast
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:47:51 the center of gravity is high
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:48:22 Its a bit above middle of ladder
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:51:44 At 38-41 sec it was almost completly flipped until the very end and the only way the wheels would have had effect is if the back one was powered, but it isnt
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 01:53:23 It would work both ways
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:00:16 First time trying to make an ornithopter, didnt use any tutorial(no idea if there are any but assuming so) im now stuck where it works but it cant propel itself without losing altitude, hence the rocket in the middle. Anyone know how i could make it propel itself?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:01:26 No
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:01:36 they are all hibernation
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:01:48 Migrationized
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:02:33 Alr
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:39:27 Ty, this works now
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:40:04 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:40:18 very slow but it can gain altidute very nicely
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:40:24 Alr one min
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:53:11 Definetly needs to be more nose heavy, i kept turning bc it made me nose down as you can see, but otherwise id say this is pretty good for a first ornithopter build w/o tut

plane-crazy 2022-01-28 03:43:34 The tanker is meant to be higher than the cab

plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:16:28 could swore that the front was more curved along the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:17:22 Tbh i think sharpening the front will make it look a bit taller too
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:28:11 Definetly better imo
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:28:59 
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:29:54 The shape of the cab looks more intimidating in a way
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 04:29:59 now

plane-crazy 2022-02-03 03:46:58 Idc bout looks just wanna do some trolling
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 03:47:55 *and anything over 500 decides to do vehicle lag for me, which reduces the trollery*
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 03:48:45 Bruh i play on a fuckin tablet what do you expect
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 03:49:55 My frames still fine just that it goes 1000 but looks like 50

events-chat 2022-02-03 04:03:46 Hold up what is the build entirely
events-chat 2022-02-03 04:11:38 Also, this is just a meme submit but if id somehow gets picked i wanna actually try, so far ive got it to be 85% stable with a top speed of 284, however strafing is weird and causes it to go mach speeds, and obv i havent set the guns up at all yet, plus i still need some form of forced ascent/descent, the idea is for it to come up to the side of the bombers being a broad sider. *this was gonna be a double bubble airship but thanks to shitty device 500+ blocks causes vehicle lag and its already up to 404

plane-crazy 2022-02-10 17:10:16 duh
creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:44:57 Bruh feedback can also be what to add to it and srsly it seems pointless that your not allowed to show unfinished builds, if thats the case this should be #completed builds not <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:47:05 Then why is it creations and creations feedback instead of finished builds and unfished builds? Makes a lot more sense that way, and again srsly a warn for a fucking WIP


How the fuck is creations and creations feedback less complicated than finished builds and unfished builds
creations-chat 2022-02-10 17:57:44 Bro literally creations and creations feedback sound like post your build here and then talk about it there not completed builds here and WIPS there how the fuck does a warn for a WIP even make any sense its literally somebody showing a build before its finished so people could give ideas
Absolute bullshit
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:09:18 Peabrain translation ***just for you***:
Creations sounds like "post your builds here" and creations feedback sounds like "discuss builds here" as opposed to in actuallity creations is for finished and feedback is for unfinished. Im argueing as to why it cant be more clarified upfront and be called completed builds and uncompleted builds

Literally only 10% of people look at that shit
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:12:28 Still should still be more clear about the way it is
I dont know how many times i have to say the channels make it sound like it works a different way than it does
DUDE I KNOW HOW CHANNELS WORK IM SAYING THESE TWO IN PARTICULAR DONT SOUND TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:15:26 yall are so fucking blind i swear to god this isnt even about my warn anymore im trying to say that the channels based off of name are different than they actually work
EASE OF USE EXISTS PEOPLE
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:19:26 Dude its not the creations part holy shit can you not read FEEDBACK indicates to me that its meant to DISCUSS, and since it is another channel with FEEDBACK added to the name of the other channel its made for, it would make sense to assume the first channel is for posting said builds COMPLETE OR NOT
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:22:03 Some of the thickest fucking skulls ive ever seen. Literally never seen a crowd so unable to comprehend what im actually saying and instead bending it into a fucking pretzel, fuck all of you.
