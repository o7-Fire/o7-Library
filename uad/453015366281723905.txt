plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:18 build it smaller then
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:26 because they are too complex to make tutorials on
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:52 because they made it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:10:54 themselv

plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:11:20 they took the basics of how it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:11:22 and remade it
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:11:23 in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 14:12:24 man im just going to say that tutorials can help but shouldnt be depended upon while they may be useful it might not fit your application you need to make it yourself

creations-chat 2021-09-27 03:31:52 <@!880395190366511105> the rudder is too big, landing gear too small, the nose is kinda akward, the shape of the plane could be a little rounder
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:37:52 you should probally ***maybe*** **probally again** read <#490306593242611742> and <#529858892075761694>
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:40:27 you should probally maybe probally again read <#490306593242611742> and <#529858892075761694>
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:04 its not like you can fix it?
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:42:26 tldr: they are remaking pcc to make it softcoded, so they dont have time to fix that bug (cause it sometimes happens or something)
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:25 just saying but shapes doesnt collide normally thats why that happens
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 04:09:08 to the moon
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 04:09:55 disguise it as a sun
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 14:29:14 just saying isnt a huey supposed to carry people not motorlocks (again just saying no pressure)
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 14:29:55 just outrun/ be small so u harder to hit
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 10:02:15 AEW
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:07:40 just dont
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:08:16 dont wha
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:17:54 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:17:57 there is a compromise
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:18:01 anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:07 <@!501691742064476161> to make a plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:30 (highly recommend to take the built in tutorial btw)
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:35 you need to place wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:40 wings is for lift
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:46 and now
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:19:51 you need to add control panels
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:19 control panels can be made in 2 ways,
1st: custom panels (using motor 2s)
2nd. control panels (built in version)
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:26 you can set the settings of the control panels
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:29 to what you like
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:36 now lastly
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:38 the rudder
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:20:47 same as control panels there are 2 ways to make them
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:05 for the rudders
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:06 make sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:17 it is orientated up
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:28 so it makes the plane stable from wobbling
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:40 for the control panels of the rudders
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:21:57 its the same for the control panels for the wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:22:11 i dont think u need to do this
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:22:12 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:22:42 no no i ment u can use ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:22:43 for it
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:22:45 easier

plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:55:50 it is generally frowned upon in most societies
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:57:21 but
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:57:22 BUT
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:57:30 if you add a building behind the fan symbol
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:57:33 it should be ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:57:34 i think

plane-crazy 2021-10-05 04:58:46 thats the same as how 1 man prevented ww3 by not pressing a button

plane-crazy 2022-03-01 04:54:42 :/ easiest way to trap ball shredder is just get a big airplane thats abit fast, get the ball to chase you and activate lava spitters in theory the ball shredder should slowly and steadily disassemble

plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:55:39 40% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:07 yea but you can place it next to eachother
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:15 so its more compact
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:23 its actually
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:31 wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:31 uh like half of the plot
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 05:56:52 a must have
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 06:02:22 can it go any faster than that:?
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 06:04:42 is it stable enough tho?

plane-crazy 2022-03-04 06:50:33 rate my 1x1* missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 06:55:01 i have absolutely no idea how to make a guided missile that is 1x1 and without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 06:55:20 you know what
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 06:55:24 its that even possible
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:33:55 the propellor is pretty small, the body seems to be abit too tall
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:09:22 rotating it?
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:54 imagine pc
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:57 but better
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:12:58 there
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:14:07 YES
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:14:20 (impossible most likely)
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 15:14:27 but hopefully doesnt drive you crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:14:15 you can always make your plane lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:14:20 to make  it go faster
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:14:41 trapdoors are heavier than regular blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:15:17 no?
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:15:34 
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:16:59 that trapdoor is heavier than block
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:17:17 look at the yellow ball
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:18:00 what
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:18:02 sure
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:20:13 huh
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:21:26 yea trapdoor is lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:21:33 so there isnt a use to the yellow ball thingy
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 03:23:24 that is very much useless
creations-chat 2022-03-06 03:38:48 isnt the runway supposed to be connected, nvm very cool 👍

help 2022-03-07 12:32:38 so you should experiment much with it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:52:21 200-10000
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:53:19 most likely faster, saw one like a plane just flew out of the plot in a instant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:15 use hover engines if they are small, they go quite fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:33 seems more of like a computer issue
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:48 they both are pretty stabe
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:55:49 stable
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:40 never happened
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:49 simply because
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:56:52 i shot them down first
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:58:59 sometimes its computer issue
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:03 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:15 indonesia
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:16 why?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 12:59:50 Jet that is less than 500 sps is alot stable than 1000 sps+
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:13 :/
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:23 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:28 my plane was shaking badly
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:30 on phone
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:35 even though it was fine
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:00:45 glhf making it beable to turn fast
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:22 might aswell remove aiming if it goes in a instant
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:26 cause its a lazer at that point
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:42 why
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:01:58 how fast is that?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:05 alr
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:08 so how fast is missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:09 ?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:13 o
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:15 now i see
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:33 also your missile might just bounce off the target
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:36 before exploding
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:02:37 btw
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:09 oh so a camera aimed missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:20 just make one yourself
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:03:26 its pretty easy to make a camera aimed missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:13:17 micro fighters for one, they are extremely hard to hit & annoying at high speeds (since most missile's aim is broken), glhf shooting them down with a gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:15:14 isnt that every Above Ground Attack Unit's thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:16:20 Regular missile is good enough

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:21:38 sometimes helicopters are better
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 13:23:13 they are essentially flying turrets

help 2022-04-13 16:02:30 Hmm a quick fix: downwards thrust basically proppelers/rockets/jet engines facing downwards so the veichle can get a good grip
help 2022-04-13 16:03:44 also if the wheels are tilted they have less contact area which means less grip

plane-crazy 2022-05-08 17:08:29 i might play werewolf again but my parents get very concerned everytime i play
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 17:08:46 they dislike hearing "choose 1 person to kill"

creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:14:26 eh i take that back turrets with guns on planes are pretty useless
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 17:15:14 huh
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 17:15:44 alr
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:20:31 (damn i need to learn to word stuff to not be confusing), trying to defend a plane with working turrets is pretty useless just because you can barely hit the thing that is attacking you
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:46:38 atleast its abit hilarious

creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:44:06 wait nvm i just saw the ship thought it was just a sail boat or something
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 00:53:37 its missing the airframe

plane-crazy 2022-05-09 00:54:11 nvm u said nose
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:58:35 damn i think you need these pairs of chinese ear stoppers so you stop hearing criticism
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:00:21 sails on a steam boat/engine powered boat doesnt make sense, im not a genius towards knowing why its not a good idea but you can just check every single god damn boat with engines and you will see 0 sails
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:02:47 why dont steam boats irl use them then, also your ship looks like a sail ship but with engines strapped on to them
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:07:21 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:07:42 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:14 its harder to make a not motorlocked build look good
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:20 cause you cant add more detail
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:49 thats why making it look good is a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:56 cause its harder than motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:10:57 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:13:10 not really
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:13:15 its harder to not use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:13:28 shit did i word this wrong
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:17:03 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:20:41 its a boat
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:20:58 its a boat
help 2022-05-09 02:58:25 its prob connected to something that makes it so that it cant lock
help 2022-05-09 03:04:05 are you sure
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:04:46 😐
creations-chat 2022-05-09 03:17:24 tldr: you delay a motorlock using tnt/springs/disconectors and then you use a motor to angle it and you continue the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 03:42:30 lol

plane-crazy 2022-05-09 08:27:10 on the wedge section i think there is a block wedge its basically a halved 2x1 wedge
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 08:27:18 try using that
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 08:30:01 try using a half wedge?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 08:30:06 from wedge*
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:37:50 seems like there is a lack of players
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:38:00 and paint
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:38:15 also what is the red dots
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:38:17 on the back
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:38:50 is it guided missile?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:39:01 close enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:40:21 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:40:31 its better to use mouse alot more of the time
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:40:38 cause keyboard movements arent as smooth as mouse
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:40:43 unless your missile moves so slow
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:40:59 i ment turns*
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:42:01 there are 1x1 ones
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:42:12 there are
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:42:16 they dont really suck
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:42:22 yes

plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:42:59 but i dislike all missiles
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:06 cause they are garbage for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:15 all of them, i mean all of them
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:18 they bounce off
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:21 their targets
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:25 cause ping issue
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:26 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:39 i cant chase a 100 sps target
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:43:52 so i
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:00 stole prototode's ap concept
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:04 and implemented it to a missile
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:33 rq

plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:36 its really good
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:40 at tearing apart
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:42 large builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:44:43 in half
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:45:18 found footage
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:45:24 
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:45:54 its a small version
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:45:55 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:00 tiny*
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:07 made it for planes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:13 the bigger ones
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:16 they basically
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:17 uh
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:21 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:46:58 oh yea ap bombs have the biggest advantage
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:47:02 the only one
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:47:05 no other bombs has
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:47:22 they can penetrate thro blacklist barrier thing
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:47:39 hm maybe make wing but reversed
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:48:03 10000 sps object
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:48:05 bounces off
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:48:09 blacklist barrier
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:48:34 how.
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:49:52 . . .
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:49:56 eitherway
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:49:59 its more practical
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:50:03 to use ap method
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:50:20 and as far as i know
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:50:23 its really reliable
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:50:41 the ap thing?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:51:23 weird
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:52:18 what
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:52:32 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:52:36 its just uses motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:53:31 basically how the ap thing works is when motor locks locks the motor locks move in a direction, we can change that direction by placing special blocks with this knowlege we can easily just abuse it to shove tnt over any blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:53:44 tldr:
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:54:32 ?? no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:55:24 you dont actually need the parachutes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:55:26 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:55:57 in protodote's version ye prob
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:56:02 i never managed to build his version
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:56:13 ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 12:56:48 i have the parachutes cause if its a small object i can just expand it and it will literally glitch it out to the 4th dimension
creations-chat 2022-05-09 13:06:11 this triggers me bruh
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:15:48 damn my missile same size as that can penetrate like the entire length of that thing
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:30:59 i think its too wide
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:31:17 or the tail wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:31:20 too small
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:31:34 also i think the rudder is abit too small
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:32:24 btw in ms paint there is a option to turn on grid
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:32:30 so you dont need to draw it
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:33:33 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2022-05-09 13:35:02 the camo looks pretty rough imo(try to replicate irl camo), other than that try removing the motorlock on the front
creations-chat 2022-05-09 13:37:04 wonder if its possible to make custom face expressions rather than a fixed one (basically a moving face)
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 13:47:13 magic
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:59:26 looks pretty good, you may need to change the paint
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:59:39 i have a pvp ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:59:43 you have a pfp ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:59:51 i ment pvp*
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:00:43 hm maybe you can try adding more missiles
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:03:14 add a lifeboat
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:03:21 required for every ship that can sink
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:21:29 can someone send a good colour for the flying dutchman
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:23:21 now it looks like a turd
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:24:01 i was reffrencing the flying dutchman from pirates of the caribbean
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:28:57 does this look good
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:30:15 simple reason: i couldnt find a replacement for cylinders that are smaller than cylinders
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:30:51 like 4 of them?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:30:57 shaped like a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:31:21 but it looks worse
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:31:22 than signs
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:33:04 1v1 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:33:22 i havent finished my ship yet
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:33:28 it only has the front triple cannons
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:34:14 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:34:36 its different
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:34:40 cause thats not mine
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:35:54 KEK
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:07 wait a second
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:08 o
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:16 i thought he was going to underground
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:20 underwater*
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:30 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:43 would it be better to turn flying dutchman to bomber
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:45 or missile carrier
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:36:59 (i cant make a kraken so its the best compromise)
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:38:30 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:38:32 it alrd destroys planes well
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 15:38:49 (ignore the ship tipping over)

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:20:16 maybe a little tilt
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:20:18 but not much
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:20:24 also that tilt is like straight up 90*
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:20:42 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:21:05 boat tilting = not good
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 10:21:08 cause it can tip over

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:29:42 the bullet or shell is going to be like HEAT shells

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:40:08 missilen't
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:41:26 if your ping is above 150 dont even bother
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:41:38 well you still can make a missile
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:41:46 but like most of the time
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:41:49 it bounces off
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:41:51 the target
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:42:00 because ping
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:42:15 missiles doesnt usually contain living humans
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:42:49 cant recall
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:44:32 tbh i wonder if a gun that shoots super duper fucking fast projectiles (at like 1mil sps) can hit a fast moving target
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:45:18 i did
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:45:25 like 3 months ago

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:47:29 btw after like using the missile around 300x i can confidently say that it sometimes bounces off the target
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:47:42 i dont have a proper jet to carry it
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:47:56 and 10fps 💀

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:48:46 anyway here is the air to air version
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:48:47 most effective at splitting ships in half
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:49:41 it depends on your ping
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:49:43 and the missile's speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:49:50 if you have low ping
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:49:53 it can be alot shorter
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:49:58 if you have high ping
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:50:03 it needs to be longer
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:50:05 or slower

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:22:46 massive error, flaw
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:22:47 no planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:22:57 no planes.
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:24:04 technically yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:24:18 but i added a thing that helps it penetrate through sloped surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:24:36 (normally it just bounces off)
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:35:14 basically by abusing motorlock mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:35:20 you can make it motorlock through the veichle
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:38:05 yes.
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:38:48 major downside to protodote's original design tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:39:06 its effectiveness reduces to like 0 once its hitting a sloped area
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:39:17 it just bounces off
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:39:20 and barely pens
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:39:24 then glitches out
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:39:59 still very op ship destroyer tho

creations-chat 2022-06-19 14:04:25 the back is supposed to have a little plate thing, bad camo & color change it to something darker, try to add real tracks, add a little plate thing over the tracks, the turret seems to be a little too round, i think the hull is too short can be taller by 1 block

TLDR: make it look like the real thing.
