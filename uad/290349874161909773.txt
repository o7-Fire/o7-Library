general 2022-09-25 15:50:21 What's a good way to make a coupler for a truck and trailer in PC?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:52:22 How can I make a coupler for a tractor trailer? Disconnectors are a one shot deal and magnets don't seem to care about each other.
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:53:02 Also, messed with magnet settings, magnets only, etc
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:54:25 Alrighty then
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:55:37 Motors can attach and detach?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:56:15 Copy, tracking.
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:56:19 Makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:56:34 Just into a hole, yeah?
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:56:54 Too bad there aren't square blocks with cylinders cut in the center
plane-crazy 2022-09-25 15:57:06 But ty, that's good for what I need
help 2022-10-31 20:09:12 I believe sparklers were a previous event item. It's listed on the wiki, just cba to find it atm
help 2022-10-31 20:13:42 The way you asked if it was a winter event item made me think you were implying an upcoming winter event. Just didn't want you to get your hopes up. Idk if they recycle them, doesn't seem so from what I've seen.
help 2022-10-31 20:24:40 What is the tip jar Gamepass for? I just can't imagine being able to actually "tip" bobux to other players and there is no in-game currency... There doesn't seem to be a "Passes" section in the game page that usually provides descriptions.
