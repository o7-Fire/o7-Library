general 2022-09-18 15:11:39 hello chat
general 2022-09-18 15:13:17 hi
general 2022-09-18 15:15:08 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:24:08 yall i got a question
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:33:34 does the ground effect exist in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:34:46 hoping plane crazy 2 does
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 04:34:55 that and compression lift
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 21:56:51 im gonna sound stupid for this but
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 21:56:54 how do i fold
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 21:57:54 could you dm me one please?
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 21:58:50 im making a fictional cargo plane thats pretty big so id need it to fold
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:20:41 it took me so long to make a functional turboprop cargo plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:21:13 its so slow with a max speed of 130 but it works
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:24:02 the thing with slow planes tho is that you can fly super low
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:25:08 superspeed is 100
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:25:26 this goes 130
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:25:31 so teeeechnically its faster
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 17:26:15 it flies tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:23:51 ptfs loads fine but plane crazy is absolutely dead
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:23:53 thats a bruh moment
general 2022-12-08 01:44:18 is it just me or has roblox been dying recently
general 2022-12-08 01:45:59 flashbacks
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:01 hello chat
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:26 requesting help with something but its gonna be very difficult since i don't have image perms
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:31:52 magnet engines are underrated tbh
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:31 hovers still top tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:33:14 also can one of you guys help me with something
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:34:28 what even is considered mach 2 in this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:34:31 is it 1400 or 2000
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:36:07 i thought mach 1 was 761 because it looks very similar to irl when ur at 761
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:36:50 i fr thought the speed measurement was in mph
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:36:53 im so dumb
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:22 how does one get image perms
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:56 hovers are my favorite engine tbh
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:59 theyre so adaptable
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:42:38 my wip fighter jet sits lower to the ground than my gpa
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:44:22 do you want me to dm you a pic because i cannot emphasize how low this thing is
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:46:21 low wing fighter jet moment
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:09 they should make it so it doesnt do that
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:54:18 the amount of hovers you would need for that would be ungodly
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:57:11 can one of you guys help me with something
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:58:45 so uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:58:54 i have a jet im working on
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:00:51 but i think its depressed
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:01:19 because it becomes very unstable whenever i go above 850
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:02:17 i have a private server but idk how to make any form of shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 04:02:31 so as much as i want to help i cant

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 13:01:50 generates thrust
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 13:01:57 just like a jet or rocket engine
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 13:02:01 just weaker

plane-crazy 2023-02-07 00:28:18 why dont decals work
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 00:32:23 why
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 00:44:16 i wouldnt know, i dont use motorlock often and can barely understand whats going on in that image
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 03:21:32 ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 12:31:13 wa
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:32:26 i am going to attempt the impossible
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:33:23 i know of (almost) every engine and how they work
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:33:39 what are u looking for?
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:33:48 alr
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:39:02 hmmm
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:40:25 yea theyre likely noclipping
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:41:31 technically
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:44:17 an aircraft can *technically* be powered with pistons via a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 16:49:35 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:51:27 conveyors:
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:52:10 hovers take too long to accelerate, conveyors also have a slight accel delay
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:54:51 true
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:54:58 hold on lemme try making something
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:57:53 i developed a low-speed vtol attack aircraft to try recreating this thing's movement, it's proving pretty difficult
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 17:59:35 i figured it out
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:00:27 unanchor to move, then anchor to stop, then repeat ig
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:00:32 gave me the closest results
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:04:07 you weren't looking hard enough
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:04:29 classic piston conveyor
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:10:09 it is
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 18:10:43 theyre really quick
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:32:36 hi chat
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:32:41 i require assistance with bombs
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:45:57 i tried that
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:46:03 they arent exploding
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:46:51 again did that
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:47:43 well
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:47:50 altitude and speed are also factors right
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:50:42 oh wow i think i figured it out
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:51:35 wonky
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:51:36 i know
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:51:50 its a little quirk that i'm too lazy to fix
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:52:03 doesnt seem to affect anything in flight
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:52:47 it is suspension, should i change that out for something else?
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:53:07 yea
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:53:50 thats nowhere near the max speed btw, it can go up to 800 but i cruise at like 400
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:56:55 theyre for cosmetic purposes
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 23:57:22 not really, just something ill take on pvp occasionally and see how long it would survive
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 01:17:06 GUYS I JUST KILLED A SHREDDER BALL
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 05:20:01 do any of you guys know what plane this is
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 23:34:09 hello chat
plane-crazy 2023-02-15 23:39:04 so ive decided to actually get into the world of pvp planes
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 00:03:14 lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-16 00:04:33 hi

plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:10:10 guys how do i make trapdoors fold on spawn
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:16:47 this is true
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:20:30 it actually doesnt
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:22:27 horrible demonstration that doesnt even prove my point but yea
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:25:22 wait till he learns the initials of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:25:54 why would you make it that fast
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:31:24 meanwhile, bombs (ignore the music i was too lazy to pause before i started recording)
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:32:07 cool
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:32:29 im not really into advanced stuff, i just make normal stuff and hope it works
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:33:16 understandable
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:33:50 lol
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:33:55 i make everything from scratch
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:34:33 this horrible b-25 took me like a month to actually complete and i still hate it
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:36:08 we've all made an f-14 x a-10 hybrid before
plane-crazy 2023-02-18 00:36:21 including me

plane-crazy 2023-03-04 00:40:34 i do not
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 00:41:33 that looks pretty complicated, i could never try this 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:16:19 i am going to attempt to make an actual good jet
the victim today is an f/a-18 super hornet
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:24:49 yo guys since i suck at building does the nose look half decent
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:25:55 how can i improve it?
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:28:10 its more a pvp build but alr
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:39:58 yeah i understand that
plane-crazy 2023-03-05 17:56:57 why does your phone watermark photos

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:38:53 tut harrier but still m2s are broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:39:26 its not
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:39:32 they simply die in the air
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:40:06 and the only thing that doesnt die is my wasd controlled shredder. tf is wrong with this game
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:41:09 test
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:42:25 but genuinely what
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:43:15 also apparently shredders got patched
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:44:00 if youre wondering how i got it in the water its called ballast tank
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 19:58:13 it is painted that way because shredders are gay
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:00:34 shredders dont even work any more
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:01:25 regular shredders dont work
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:01:52 i don't use shredders i only have that one because i wanted to see how they worked and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:01:59 ^
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:02:08 motor 2 flaps are broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:02:23 everything motor 2 is broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:02:50 <@652341016510201856>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:06:06 M2M is also broken

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:07:25 ik the jet sucks
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:08:00 they only work on the ground

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:09:10 hm yes definitely working
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:09:29 definitely
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:09:45 it doesnt
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:10:01 it is not
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:10:48 not my keyboard bc its brand new and the issue is only on motor 2 controlled aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:11:12 controls for flaps
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:11:46 by how much
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:12:34 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:12:37 and none of them work
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:12:43 they worked fine yesterday
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:12:57 i have 2 that use M2M and 2 that use keyboard controls
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:13:09 i have several times
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:13:21 i've hopped several different servers

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:14:12 <@859317318193643550>
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:14:23 torque is now maxed and nothing has changed
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:15:13 only happens once airborne
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:15:22 happens even when wings aren't swept
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:15:32 and they dont collide when they are swept
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:16:15

plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:18:41 replacing them didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:19:39 
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:20:11 wtf is happening
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:20:24 motor 2 doesnt work unless on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:20:29 roblox is broken i swear
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:21:36 not M2M
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:21:40 keyboard controlled
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:21:45 and M2M is also broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:23:13 fuck it im gonna set up my 2017 ahh laptop to see if it actually is my computer
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:24:03 even though the hardware is significantly worse
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:24:29 i just use cluster bombs because they work
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:25:16 yea ima just make it the size of the first half wedge in wedges
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:25:39 fuck it im playing ksp
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:35:02 motor 2 is broken. end of story
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 20:35:09 same
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 23:59:07 my AC-119 is the only plane of mine that uses M2 control that can still fly
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:04:35 motor 2s only die in the air
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:04:40 and water
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:04:45 ig theyre ground only now
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:11:29 probably the only M2 controlled plane that survived the motor 2 nerf is my C-119 because the ailerons are absolutely massive
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:11:50 
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:12:23 absolutely nothing because my plane is unaffected
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:13:24 am i god?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:14:24 M2M is completely broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:10 i think we just have to complain enough
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:47 wait
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:58 this isnt plane crazy's fault
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:17:59 it's roblox
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:18:01 as always
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 00:22:43 my Su 27 is now useless lmao

plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:47:40 i tried that
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:47:42 it didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:47:43 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:55:48 i thought these horrible objects went extinct
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:59:04 a goofy F-86
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:59:15 because i suck at small planes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:59:45 and my best fighter is currently unusable because motor 2 bug, so this is my second best option
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 04:00:51 just killed the shredder
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 04:01:50 he left because i killed him twice in a row lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 04:06:11 i honestly don't really mind shredders
**but spam builds**
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 19:58:33 only in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 20:46:16 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 21:34:03 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 04:03:05 guys
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 04:03:11 theres a new bugged weapon in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 04:04:33 
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 04:08:49 their weakness is, ironically, shredders
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 04:08:51 and rockets
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:22:53 i love this game
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:24:45 sup
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:27:05 nice

plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:16:11 i have a stupid question:
afterburners or thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:16:19 the aircraft in question is a mig-25
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:20:23 mil mi 24
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:21:22 or an AH-1
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:31:10 F-16?
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:41:56 pretty good
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 22:22:44 better than what i can do
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 22:22:47 looks great man
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 22:28:37 ngl people who use shredders for good are underappreciated
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 00:06:25 only in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 00:07:55 how's it coming along?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 00:24:10 remaking my me 262 because i'm bored and dont know what to make
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:38:11 ?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:38:43 used to be Saiph
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:39:04 changed it to Alhena earlier
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:40:04 you can never have too much aileron
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 02:44:09 guess the plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 03:12:28 what
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 03:17:50 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 01:14:17 idk why but this looks pretty cool, annoying as it is
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 01:15:31 piper pa-34 seneca
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 01:15:51 civilian aircraft but looks pretty complicated
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 01:16:09 
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 02:35:19 ignore the music i'm too lazy to remove the audio

wtf is wrong with rockets lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 02:38:28 they can't shred you if they can't catch up
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 02:40:46 does anyone know how to motorlock rockets
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 02:41:29 i want all my rockets to just be like the 2 on the wing
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 03:18:24 hello pcc
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 03:35:56 a320's probably
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 04:32:59 i forgot what i sent this message for but it was around the time i was redoing my Me 262 so i was probably gonna ask for help with that lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 22:15:04 seats are broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 00:31:16 just a few days ago motor 2s bugged tf out and were completely unusable in the air
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 00:32:11 only if your plane had normal sized ailerons/elevators
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 00:32:22 for some reason, my AC-119 was unaffected
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 22:48:08 hello chat
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 22:48:17 i made an me-262
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 22:54:42 neither did i 🔥🔥

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:39:54 F-15 probably
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:41:15 i mean it literally is named the eagle which is the national bird of the US
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:29:55 guys
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:30:04 i have a very controversial question
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:30:17 is this smart or annoying
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:30:40 ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:31:47 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:35:42 another sorta related question: are namnam jets good or annoying
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:36:43 can i join ur pvp server rq i wanna troll him
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:37:33 i doubt you would be able to make something that covers the whole map
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:37:57 alr
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:38:27 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:38:38 ima just bring out the namnam jet and call it a day
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 16:54:01 i just entered their user in the gamemode selector thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 22:05:09 uh
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 22:49:58 valid roast or nah?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 03:14:38 b-25?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:02:48 i made a very goofy jet
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:04:05 it took me like 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:06:44 it kinda looks like a mig 25 and f18 love child
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:06:45 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:07:36 its pretty slow, maneuverability is kinda decent but is better as an attack jet than a fighter
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:12:05 has a pretty cool shadow tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:13:37 idk lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:13:46 why
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:14:26 oh god
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:17:09 iirc my basic shredder has killed like 4 shredder balls
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:17:15 not much but its honest work
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:19:36 maximum speed that a basic shredder can handle with the shredding part going is ~1300
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:54:23 i finally made a supermaneuverable jet
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:55:41 sorta namnam styled custom
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:57:22 can perform post stall maneuvers
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:57:24 basically
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 20:59:09 ^
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:00:45 kvochur bell:
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:02:45 i have like 28 days playtime on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:03:07 tnt armor:
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:04:47 oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:06:11 and this is why i have a shredder to counter other shredders + spam builds
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:08:08 one of my jets can lose an entire side of wings and continue flight as if nothing happened lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:08:51 literally this
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:09:09 flying is one thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:09:14 having control is another
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:09:56 i think the main reason my jet can continue flight after losing a wing is that it uses m2m, but that might not be it
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:18:59 i dont think in the history of plane crazy theres been a level wasd controlled plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:19:54 did you set the motors to lock
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:20:09 💀
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:34:46 ngl thats better than my heli, those missiles are awesome
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:36:03 "abc to ride on my blackbird"
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:00 according to the builder
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:01 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:37:28 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:41:42 bro thinks this is a blackbird
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 21:45:50 is bro saying that phone is better than pc for pvp?

plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:37:05 supermaneuverable
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:39:19 someone shat on my jet while i was building it because it "looked like vulpen's"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:39:52 this thing looks and performs better than 90% of pvp jets that i've seen
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:39 i spent an entire month working on a b-25
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 03:40:44 lot of people hated it

plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:49:00 teal bottom 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:52:42 i call this one the "we've been tricked, backstabbed, and quite possibly bamboozled"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:55:04 i cant tell if thats an insult or a very sarcastic compliment
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 04:56:26 wdym edit

plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:30:37 my su 47 just got its first shredder kill
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:30:38 lessgooo
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 04:11:07 guys
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 04:11:19 is this maybe too much engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 04:14:04 zoom
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 12:07:39 what about an entire wing blown off
and an elevator and rudder
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 12:08:08 wait wrong jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 12:08:19 missing right wing and right rudder
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 12:13:28 i never said i was good
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 04:53:20 hey guys
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 04:53:35 my friend claims his "F-117" is better than my Su 47
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 04:53:45 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:01:04 do any of you guys think that this is a tutorial
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:01:11 i just wanna know
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:01:15 does it look like a tutorial
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:02:15 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:02:39 its not
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:03:15 thats what im sayin
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:03:47 i spent 5 minutes trying to get this aligned with vulpen's angle just so i could compare the two
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:04:13 ok yeah i see the similarities
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:04:42 doesnt mean its a tutorial tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 05:04:58 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 06:06:53 effective but annoying
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 06:07:45 on a scale of boxcar (1) to shredder (10) i'd say about a 3
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 06:08:09 boxcars are easy to deal with
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:37:50 hey guys remind me to make an f-15 when i get home
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:37:54 im at school rn
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:38:02 k adios
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 00:31:02 it should be something like this, not perfectly aligned
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:15:37 so i tried camo
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:16:58 welcome to: tutorial or built from scratch
today's aircraft- messerschmitt 262
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:18:26 according to this, the tutorial plane has naval compatibility
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:25:40 assuming you're working on the 262. here's how i did mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:26:10 looks like crap but it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:26:46 the 262 is a simple but complicated aircraft at the same time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:26:57 i built one back in november and it sucked
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:27:15 remade it a few weeks ago and heres the new result
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:27:41 literally just fabric blocks with ladders
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:28:56 i just shot down a flying amazon van
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:29:01 does that count as an air to air kill
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:33:36 do you guys think i made good exhausts
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:36:20 but how tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:37:01 im not doing angle lock on a sub 300 block plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:35 dont use jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:38 theyre very heavy
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:45 their power to weight ratio sucks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:49 the engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:38:53 not the aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:39:41 i'd rather use hover engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:39:51 nice power to weight ratio + stackable
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:40:21 wdym piston
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:40:29 i thought it was hover and motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:41:24 i didnt know that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:41:39 it seems that the motor starts off faster
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:42:13 
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:42:48 both motors are at their default settings
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:00 bombs but
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:29 locked motors don't work, unpowered ones do
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:37 i think unpowered might be the word you're looking for?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:48:23 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:49:14 i don't build boats but looks pretty good so far
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:49:19 good luck
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:00:39 me personally i dont use motorlock for structure, only for weaponry
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:06:54 i understand that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:07:07 but i'd rather have an aircraft that's durable than an aircraft that looks good
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:08:47 my pvp su-27 comes apart if it gets hit like 4 times with guns
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:09:05 because motorlock towers arent really good for structure
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:10:06 would destroy weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:12:27 i'd say my jets rely more on their firepower than my skill
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:12:44 speed, maneuverability, firepower is the things i focus on
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:13:50 i have an absolutely tiny f-86 with too many rockets
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:14:29 it is the greatest menace to ever grace the skies of plane crazy pvp
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:14:46 behind shredders those things are annoying af
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:12 lord help me
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:23:38 new plane crazy pvp rule: teaming is allowed if it is against any form of spam build or shredder
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:24:56 WE HAVE 8 PEOPLE AGAINST A SHREDDER
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:27:43 shredder guy left
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:30:31 if its only that display then its a display issue
if it is across different displays then yes, gpu issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:31:29 i have a single monitor setup that i run on dp
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:31:49 ill add a second monitor eventually for discord
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:32:24 urs is better than mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:32:46 i have a 5800x3d / 6650xt
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:22 my gpu is like 3060ish levels
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:37 3060ti if i overclock it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:47 i have no reason to
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:34:03 its already better than what i need it for
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:34:48 anyways, me-262 jumpscare
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:36:10 bro got that nokia 3310
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:37:31 mfw
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:20 32
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:41 welp ima go to bed bois
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:48 almost 2 am
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:40:09 i hosted a minecraft server on a 2010 laptop once
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:09 imagine standing next to a boeing 747 while it was taking off.
that's how loud my laptop was.
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:22 hp
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:39 it has a quadcore i3 and 8gb of ram
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:46 from 2010
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:52 beast for its time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:42:29 my grandma has a laptop from 2004 with a pentium
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:42:40 it still works
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:46:10 the cpu is how fast a computer can do something
the ram is how many of that thing it can do at the same time
the gpu is how good that thing looks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:46:46 shouldnt we move to general or?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:48:19 10 graphics at 240 is normal to me
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:51:11 heres my main rig
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:51:14 not much but it's something
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:28:14 guys i have a question
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:28:19 what vibes do you get from this shadow
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:29:56 how tf
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:30:00 did you know
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:31:05 262 go brrr
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:31:54 it is a rather nice looking aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:33:27 it's basically the mig-25 of ww2
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:34:26 it was fast but not maneuverable, and wasnt really as good as it seemed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:35:57 the mig 25
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:36:00 foxbat
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:36:36 the F-15 exists because of the mig 25
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:36:51 only we actually had the resources to make ours good
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:37:40 the 262 wouldve been better too if germany had the resources to improve it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:37:49 but funny mustache man said "nah this a bomber now"
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:39:21 540 mph in 1944 was insane tbh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:39:28 but it didnt need to go that fast
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:40:05 i think the 262 existed as an idea in like, 1938-39?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:40:25 the development was quick
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:42:56 the goose?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:52:06 did rocket tracking just die or something
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 04:10:21 my rocket is faster
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 04:10:45 my friend's helium box has gone 8 times the speed of light
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 16:23:17 guys i got a question
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 16:23:30 is there such thing as a jet being 'too maneuverable'
plane-crazy 2023-04-15 17:29:24 i hate people who make these kind of builds and blacklist everyone
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 01:27:04 goofy paper airplane
plane-crazy 2023-04-16 14:36:24 depends on the size. i have a relatively large su 47 that i guess you could call supermaneuverable but i wouldn't really say that lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:35:15 i hate shredders 👍
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:38:52 aw hell nah wtf man
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:50:59 so i was bored and decided to repaint my mig 25
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:51:49 ik its bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:53:04 do you guys think this looks decent
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 14:53:13 i based it off this
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 15:45:02 so apparently people are now making QR codes that lead to *websites* in pc
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 15:50:27 no like
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 15:50:42 18+ websites
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:22:56 do you guys think an F-5 would be a good jet for me to practice my skill on?
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:23:09 i wanna take a shot at building it
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:23:17 that spine will be a nice challenge
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:28:37 ima have some fun, take my hands at an f-14
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:34:33 i think the hardest part would be the intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:59:17 theyre angled
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 21:30:19 my mig 25 arguably looks better than that
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 21:35:40 im bored gonna upgrade it to a mig 31
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 21:43:40 damn i suck at this
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 03:30:55 never before have i ever seen a jet so bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 04:02:24 i made a relatively decent custom
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 04:03:27 it is heavily based on it
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 04:04:56 if i did actually attempt to make this into an actual mig 23 then i would have 3 migs
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 04:23:01 i despise motorlock towers
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 04:44:07 somehow someway this thing stalls at 40
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:39:26 hello chat
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:40:36 how in gods name do i make this
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:41:02 im confused on the entire engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:41:13 this is my first time making a jet with 1 engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:42:00 i'm working on a (horrible attempt of) a mig 23
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:46:34 rare shredder W
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:46:41 fire vs fire
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:49:23 
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 13:49:28 fast ahh
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 20:56:22 the maneuver is called the kvochur bell
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:02:34 for it to be considered a cobra does it have to do the funny 'keep moving despite roblox physics saying no'
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:06:01 whats wasdcore i forgot
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:07:52 the mig 23 is supermaneuverable right
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:07:58 or am i confusing that with another jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:14:06 damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:14:40 i just stop moving
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:15:33 is there any thrust vectoring involved
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:16:40 am i putting equal amounts of helium and fuel in the rear
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:16:41 or
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:16:58 o
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:17:55 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:18:49 weird
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:18:49 this is
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:19:44 it doesnt glide as long as i want it to
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:36:30 experimentation
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:54:50 is that mouse controlled tvc
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:55:05 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:56:21 also is that a mig 23
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:57:21 mine is worse
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:58:55 yea its big
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 21:59:16 its so goofy
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:00:06 something i forgot to fix
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:00:48 is this acceptable
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:01:52 aeiou
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:02:36 trails dont weld to pyra wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:05:04 cries in exposed motorlock on mig 31
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:13:43 this shit sucks so much i should delete it tbh
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:41:36 NOW THATS A MIG 31
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:41:39 holy shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:43:54 thats amazing
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:45:46 just looked at your user
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:45:54 nice to meet you
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:47:41 the WSO in mine has a cupholder :)
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:48:29 better cober than mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:51:01 wait till you see my pvp-only jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:52:06 first we have
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:52:27 goofy ahh unrealistic 262
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:54:06 that foxhound looks very angry
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:54:59 idk
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:55:00 it just does
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:55:29 mig 29?
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:55:37 or is that a flanker
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:56:30 next we have: goofy ahh fairchild ac-119
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:57:55 its so bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 22:58:00 i need to redo it
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 23:56:29 
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 23:56:50 brrrr
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 00:22:13 2 ballast beams at 27.5
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 00:22:31 no im poor i use amd
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 00:51:08 if you want a lot of lift? then yes
if not, then no
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 00:59:23 is this a good or bad cobra
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:01:15 the f15 is just a smaller mig 25 basically
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:02:05 take my mig 31 for a reference
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:02:22 accurate
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:10:35 boats
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:44:26 my mig 23 started out as a panavia tornado from a build battle and it won but it looked horrible so after like 2 months i converted it into a mig 23
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 02:30:27 just another advantage :)
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 23:24:26 my mig 23 agrees with this statement
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:09:12 was bored remade my f86 w/ kamikaze livery
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:12:10 this design is literally from an eminem album cover
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:12:50 ik
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:13:06 licensed to ill came out in 1986 iirc
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:13:09 kamikaze 2018
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:19:26 
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:19:38 
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:19:46 i want it on both sides
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:20:49 where should i make the tower tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:20:54 i have like no room
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 02:21:38 thats what u look like
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 03:08:10 my f-86 has a cupholder :)
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 03:12:39 im just joking im not that skilled its just protruding motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 01:17:10 would thrust vectoring + conveyors allow for a better cobra than ballast and conveyors
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 01:25:44 why does your gun sound like bank security cam mics
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:42:53 no just regular tvc
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:43:05 with the little conveyor glide thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:43:31 magnet engine is crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:44:11 isnt the magnet engine just a less powerful version of the conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:45:00 theyre my main source of power usually
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:45:30 my mig 31 runs entirely off hovers
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:46:02 those things get it to 1900, which, for its size, is actually impressive
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:47:23 br
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:48:08 i just set my drag to 0
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:48:22 i have a 4 block plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 02:49:01 im gonna make a 3 block plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:05:42 made a goofy amphibious truck
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:15:19 super rocket
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:15:30 for vanilla engines its super rocket
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:16:40 normal engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:16:43 props, jets, rockets
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 22:17:57 i said it was goofy
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:03:14 dogfight of the century
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:05:25 god that pic is so old
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:05:42 that version of my b25 sucked
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:06:32 not my newest
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:06:47 just a redesign of my f-86
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:06:53 (which sucked before i redid it)
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:07:00 it sucks slightly less
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:07:14 like it actually looks like an f-86 now
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 23:11:15 it resembles it sorta
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:01:28 
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:02:02 you act like i care about your opinion
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:07:23 you still act like i care
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:13:46 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:16:17 hard to argue with that tbh
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:21:17 did a little bit of changing
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 03:24:50 ailerons
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:00:57 are people who fight shredders with shredders valid
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:15:36 shredders have died down a bit but probably omni or minis
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:17:54 i never thought i'd say this-
i've gotten good at using shredders.
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:18:00 against shredders
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:20:47 i just have an upgraded basic one
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:21:00 it overpowers minis and poorly built omnis
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:21:37 the guy i was trolling just ragequit
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 04:21:42 i love being an anti-shredder user
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 22:36:41 ima try to make a harrier
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 02:00:40 21
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 03:26:20 mikoyan is doomed
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 03:26:31 crap wrong server
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 03:26:34 laugh at me
plane-crazy 2023-04-30 03:35:58 make a faster jet i dare you
plane-crazy 2023-05-07 20:13:30 me waiting for half wedge down/up 1x3 and 1x4
general 2023-05-12 01:52:01 that is a flanker 💀
general 2023-05-12 01:53:12 gonna (attempt to) make a tu 160
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 22:03:43 china uses trains as well
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 22:03:55 anyways time to start my tu-160 because my friend said i should try making that
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:37:22 for comparison
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:39:28 for reference the f-22 is the largest american fighter jet at almost 19m long
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:40:02 the b-25 is only 16m
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:40:27 its a medium bomber from ww2
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:41:03 its just an expensive maneuverable brick
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:41:38 f15 better for the job anyways
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:41:51 or f/a-18

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:42:43 for the "oh shit" moments
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:45:04 the 4 su 57s in service when i pull up with a philips head screwdriver

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:46:07 and 5th gens in pc are kinda all bark no bite
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:46:36 ive killed several 5th gens with my su 27
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:46:53 ive shot down every b-21 ive seen
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:47:22 its a 6th gen and it cant do shit except blow stuff up
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 20:48:44 the innocent strike eagle when i pull up with a su 27

plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:06:53 
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:09:11 u can motorlock one in
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:13:14 motorlock is awesome
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:20:47 mfs will slap 28 propellers on a jet and call it supermaneuverable
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:24:00 my su 47 can do the kvochur bell but it doesnt glide like the actual maneuver so it isn't supermaneuverable
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:25:46 that is a lot of hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 21:35:48 zoom
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 23:43:07 it is
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 23:45:35 im experimenting with paper aircraft designs
plane-crazy 2023-05-14 23:47:16 made a design where the orientation of the aircraft determines speed or distance
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 01:52:23 i only really use 3 vehicles on pcpvp- my apache, my flanker, and my anti air
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 20:28:55 me waiting for a torque option for vanilla wheels
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 20:37:43 that would remove my vehicle's ability to maneuver like a relatively high performance car
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 20:39:19 this goofy ass tank killer
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 20:53:18 motor 2s have wobble issues

plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:35:06 this pc is so old it cannot take screenshots
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:35:29 it is not going well
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:37:43 i can do basic motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:37:47 idk how to angle lock though
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:37:59 and ive accidentally camera locked a few times
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:43:44 i used their tutorial on bombs
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:44:06 im not trying to make the best thing in the world
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 20:44:18 but this is supposed to be an improvement from my last airliner
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:26:23 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:26:31 4th gens were the last good generation
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:27:52 cus they were the last generation to have actual close combat n stuff
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:36:12 its a pretty hard aircraft to make
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:36:28 i tried making one a while back and it looked so bad that i just gave up and turned it into a mig 23
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:38:14 my glider glitched out once and i got to inf speed
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:38:30 its not a good glider
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 22:39:01 the wings are abnormally large and ugly and it doesnt really like being spawned

plane-crazy 2023-07-01 00:02:59 its basically just a carpet with 2 hovers and some control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 00:06:03 the acceleration alone is 100g
