bug-reports 2023-01-01 16:55:26 so i build a "jetpack" and somethimes i have a problem with the jet engine i used that one of the 2 would give less thrust pls fix this or if anyone knows how to fix this let me know
general 2023-01-01 18:16:26 this might be a weard question to ask here but does anyone know about how to calculate how long the legs of my mech should be with the golden ratio
