creations-chat 2021-12-29 08:50:52 any suggestions on how to improve my ship exhaust https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844231725890666496/925671196815679568/2021-12-29_10-43-04.mp4
creations-chat 2021-12-29 09:00:05 first, thanks for the embed, also i was considering adding more smoke, but i was more concerned about the shape and size of the exhaust, i think it doesn't fit the ship that well.
creations-chat 2021-12-29 09:02:34 the part that looks like it has been shredderbuged is not build yet. that is why there is also no color or details
creations-chat 2022-01-02 17:15:35 can you guys help me, how do i put glass only in the blue area? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844231725890666496/927248166980575252/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:17:48 Hi guys
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:18:26 All good, you
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:20:25 What
bot-central 2022-01-05 16:20:58 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:24:14 Is motor lock even worth it?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:26:06 I hope it exists
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:26:24 Motor locking takes so much space for nothing
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:28:07 How big will the plots be?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:28:57 I hope they can get up to 400m
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:29:11 Wait only 100?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:29:48 But will still need folding for big ships
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:30:39 They will improve performance right?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:31:19 Custom engines when
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:33:12 It would be nice to add gun variety in pvp but not to overpowered weapons like cutter can be
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:33:41 Cool is it considered yet
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:34:16 Why are they so secretive about it
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:34:29 I understand not giving release date
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:36:56 They probably will be the same, physics are roblox's "property" and the same acros all roblox games, right?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 16:38:01 I hope they are, water buoyancy is trash
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 17:11:58 Is he mr bruh or stuff?
