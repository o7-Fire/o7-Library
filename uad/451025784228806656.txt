creations-chat 2019-07-24 14:49:04 The front air vents can rotate and the back engine can as well. But to stableize the VTOL and the funtion if actually flying it is pretty hard. (Sorry for my bad spelling/grammar.)
creations-chat 2019-07-25 00:02:25 I like how my missile reloading system on my ATGM launcher is almost the same, BionclSage. Can you try doing a really compact missile one? I like to see what you can make in a 2 high workspace.
creations-chat 2019-07-25 01:24:36 I'm on vacation right now... But if you manage something always ping me. I'm curructly in a jungle with no access to WiFi. I'll send you a pic of mine.

creations-chat 2019-12-03 15:08:31 Agree on the creative part, except all planes we get are noob planes with maxed out pvp weapons equipped on them

plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:31:15 Modern?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:31:30 How big?
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:33:16 I can't find a picture of a city I made for a server
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:34:20 Can't find a higher resolution picture but this is what it looked like
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 15:34:48 It's pretty plain
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:01:42 Whats a fucking steel ball run
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:02:15 Sounds big weeb
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:02:47 No actually
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:03:03 I just picture a seal riding a ball
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:03:47 Never seen it
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 00:06:01 At least he had a brain unlike you
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 12:56:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 12:56:56 Dingy
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 12:58:16 The cannon looks gay agreed
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 12:58:28 But what did you expect
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:26:05 I already got vacation
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:26:48 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:30:33 What
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:30:34 Where
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:33:56 Oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:34:13 Did they state what caused the crash?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:34:56 Do they even know how it crashed let me ask that first
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:35:57 Damn
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:36:07 Did it crash near the coast or?
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:36:18 In the middle of the ocean
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:36:26 Fucking hell
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:37:03 This is a reason to love your job and do it correctly
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:37:23 At least, if it's the mechanics fault
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:37:32 The pilot probalby wasn't
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:38:02 A C-130's structure is pretty solid
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:38:10 And it's engines are well armored
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:38:20 I think that is the cause
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:38:30 Mechanical failure
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:39:23 If you go in a straight dive, it isn't going to do anything tho
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:39:40 I think the elevator was broken
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:40:03 Some electrical nerd must have checked it wrong
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:41:12 I know
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:41:23 But the Hercules relies on it's elevator
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:41:54 If it's broken, after some time it will begin to tilt forwards

general 2020-11-10 20:37:46 I get the feeling this dude complains about germany being underpowered
general 2020-11-10 20:39:00 At what angle did you climb

general 2020-11-10 20:39:49 and don't use torpedoes

general 2021-03-04 17:33:01 what should I go for

general 2021-03-04 17:33:20 One is in naval line

general 2021-03-04 17:34:24 P-63 is better

general 2021-03-04 17:34:44 And they have
general 2021-03-04 17:34:49 everything better

general 2021-03-09 17:42:39 Yes, but some have barely any. You can just respray em and thats it

general 2021-03-09 17:45:21 I recall the Kuruma being added in 2014
general 2021-03-09 17:45:29 Might be wrong

general 2021-06-01 12:15:16 to
general 2021-06-01 12:18:18 Okay but fr
general 2021-06-01 12:18:20 why the fuck
general 2021-06-01 12:18:22 do you need
general 2021-06-01 12:18:24 a new video card
general 2021-06-01 12:18:36 It's pretty much cheaper to buy a new pc all togheter
general 2021-06-01 12:18:58 I run a i7 and a 1050 and it runs fine
general 2021-06-01 12:19:15 What does Dutch have to do with pc specs what
general 2021-06-01 12:20:01 You can litteraly buy a prebuild for that price and have GTAV run at 60 FPS
general 2021-06-01 12:20:50 None
general 2021-06-01 12:20:54 Since I don't like meat
general 2021-06-01 12:21:15 My own pc is cheaper than the graphics card he wants
general 2021-06-01 12:21:54 Ah yes, so making a more sensible financial decision makes me Dutch
general 2021-06-01 12:21:58 Taking that as a compliment
general 2021-06-01 12:21:59 lol
general 2021-06-01 12:22:12 I'll check hold on
general 2021-06-01 12:22:35 What games would you possible want to play lol
general 2021-06-01 12:23:02 Bruh
general 2021-06-01 12:23:29 So, you buy an entire PC just to play a game that requires those specs
general 2021-06-01 12:23:31 very wise
general 2021-06-01 12:25:33 It's more like buying an F1 car to race a production race on
general 2021-06-01 12:25:47 Yes, you will have top notch performance
general 2021-06-01 12:25:51 but what else after the race
general 2021-06-01 12:26:51 There just aren't that much games that require so much performance
general 2021-06-01 12:27:04 And by the time the games get there
general 2021-06-01 12:27:13 you're stuck with a broken pc by that point
general 2021-06-01 12:31:24 Just buy it.
general 2021-06-01 12:31:29 I really couldn't give more shits
general 2021-06-01 12:31:58 Just saying that in my eyes, it's an absolute waste of money you can use in the near future
general 2021-06-01 12:34:08 Won't discuss it further since I don't want a full of shitthrowing war with you like most people do here. All I will say is have fun with it
general 2021-06-01 12:35:11 Good for you 👍
general 2021-06-01 12:39:31 he's either 13 or 14 now lol
general 2021-06-01 12:43:06 extremely nice status

general 2021-06-01 12:43:59 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2021-06-01 12:44:21 I'm not that far as well
general 2021-06-01 12:44:31 But I don't want top tier shit
general 2021-06-01 12:45:00 Yeah that's cool, want to see a magic trick?
general 2021-06-01 12:46:02 I only play WT in multiple nations
general 2021-06-01 12:46:25 Don't bother with getting OP vehicles or Top tier ATGM bullcrap
general 2021-06-01 12:46:59 Maximum you should go for per nation in ground is 6.7 imo
general 2021-06-01 12:47:09 anything above it becomes unfun
general 2021-06-01 12:48:24 You just hide behind a rock, get spotted with those damn thermals, laser rangefinder and guns with absolutely zero ballistics and die
general 2021-06-01 12:48:35 Or get Helicopter'd from across the map
general 2021-06-01 12:48:56 Or ATGM outta nowhere because they hide the hull
general 2021-06-01 12:49:01 It's basically Arcade battles
general 2021-06-01 12:49:34 Yes, but you barely have the time in top tiers
general 2021-06-01 12:50:01 Might just be me having too much fun flanking and playing light tanks though
general 2021-06-01 12:50:31 Sniping will get too boring unless you're shooting at aircraft with an AA

general 2021-06-02 08:11:42 The turning point was when Jay got banned

general 2021-06-02 08:18:01 I don't even play plane crazy anymore, but I stuck around because of the community
general 2021-06-02 08:18:19 but now that the community is almost renewed, there is no reason for me to stay here anymore

general 2021-06-02 08:22:12 Within the next year or so, most if not all active people will have left
general 2021-06-02 08:22:24 My predictions is that some mods will retire by then
general 2021-06-02 08:22:47 My second nsfw warnings ban is incoming

general 2021-06-02 08:35:05 When was he banned/did he leave
general 2021-06-02 08:35:16 Imperial
general 2021-06-02 08:35:34 Speak up
general 2021-06-02 08:37:46 My turning point was either when Jay left, or when the whole mod rebellion happened
general 2021-06-02 08:39:42 Basically, obc didn't agree with how Rick operated the server and stuff. He retired for a short while and the whole moderator team sided with him. Rick came in clutch by making an agreement with obc and everything was back to normal. Except for the community
general 2021-06-02 08:39:57 People freaked out because obc simps left etc
general 2021-06-02 08:41:58 Agreed.
general 2021-06-02 08:43:48 I joined somewhere late 2018
general 2021-06-02 08:43:50 before my ban
general 2021-06-02 08:44:00 yes

general 2021-06-02 08:45:30 Already a mod in another server now
general 2021-06-02 08:46:01 Pretty much 4 hours of anarchy
general 2021-06-02 08:46:32 By being one of the first to join in a server hence knowing the community
general 2021-06-02 08:46:53 It's not that big, only around 1k members
general 2021-06-02 08:47:14 Too bad, private server <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-02 08:49:43 Notice how there's a filtered word in there

general 2021-06-02 10:35:07 People think so yes
general 2021-06-02 10:36:02 People need to understand that Genders and things you're attracted to are 2 different things

general 2021-06-03 06:03:45 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2021-06-03 06:05:53 the US of A will now be called 'New York'
general 2021-06-03 06:06:02 No objections
general 2021-06-03 06:06:39 When political
general 2021-06-03 06:07:21 they do be watching though
general 2021-06-03 06:10:26 I'm fine with them getting rights, that's a must in my opinion. Though the hardcore LGBT pieces of shit that cause all this drama and only became that way for attention must be locked up in jail, sentenced to 50 years without internet and maybe try being a little more respectful to "the oh so horrible straight people"
general 2021-06-03 06:10:55 No internet will be torture enough for them
general 2021-06-03 06:11:04 Since they cannot get the attention they seek
general 2021-06-03 06:11:16 Isolation is what they need
general 2021-06-03 06:13:19 I've been taught to respect everyone but the people who disrespect people cause of something like religion
general 2021-06-03 06:14:51 yep
general 2021-06-03 06:16:08 that LGBTQ+ deserve rights, but not the movement
general 2021-06-03 06:16:12 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-06-03 06:16:35 2 genders, and 1838 choices
general 2021-06-03 06:16:52 Gender and sexuality are 2 really different things
general 2021-06-03 06:17:12 Like bruh how do I got a gay in my pants
general 2021-06-03 06:17:17 how does that make sense
general 2021-06-03 06:17:53 I am an exception

general 2021-06-03 06:48:56 would hallucination be considered to be sleep paralysis?
general 2021-06-03 06:49:16 It does look shit yes
general 2021-06-03 06:50:00 Is this only the concept reveal?
general 2021-06-03 06:50:16 Better than interested in Anime

general 2021-06-03 07:05:33 People who are into "car culture" and do not want the car to look "stock" be like
general 2021-06-03 07:05:39 
general 2021-06-03 07:05:53 K24 swapped S15
general 2021-06-03 07:06:48 poor mclaren
general 2021-06-03 07:07:07 and then people really putting this on such a nice car
general 2021-06-03 07:10:03 Reason I do not go to fast food chains that much is because of the lazy workers that put the cheese of your burger only on half the burger itself
general 2021-06-03 07:10:51 agreed
general 2021-06-03 07:15:42 when arcade <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-06-03 07:19:46 The ONLY thing I liked when I went to the American food chains, were the hash browns at Wafflehouse
general 2021-06-03 07:19:54 and the crispy bacon
general 2021-06-03 07:21:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495286269459300364/815687110513655878/OBCfat.png
general 2021-06-03 07:21:06 after he ate it
general 2021-06-03 07:24:02 this looks disgusting
general 2021-06-03 07:25:07 the KFC here makes some actual tender chicken
general 2021-06-03 07:25:25 Gravy is fine here
general 2021-06-03 07:25:43 Leon you never tried KFC?
general 2021-06-03 07:25:52 Imo underrated here
general 2021-06-03 07:26:00 people don't go there because
general 2021-06-03 07:26:03 very expensive
general 2021-06-03 07:26:40 Same here, but if you're close to one I recommend it
general 2021-06-03 07:26:52 the chicken is so fucking tender with a crustly layer
general 2021-06-03 07:27:15 a LOT
general 2021-06-03 07:27:16 better
general 2021-06-03 07:27:48 Have you seen the Mcdonalds in France and Malaysia?
general 2021-06-03 07:28:25 Seriously don't know because we didn't go there, but the building looked really promising
general 2021-06-03 07:28:52 Subway is meh
general 2021-06-03 07:29:09 It's good for lunch when you've been working from 6
general 2021-06-03 07:29:20 But the bread
general 2021-06-03 07:29:25 it's too much
general 2021-06-03 07:29:38 disagreed
general 2021-06-03 07:29:45 I seriously dislike olives
general 2021-06-03 07:30:05 The immense taste
general 2021-06-03 07:30:09 it overcomes everything
general 2021-06-03 07:30:41 Pistachio nuts are really good though
general 2021-06-03 07:32:22 Mcdonalds is overrated for what it actually is
general 2021-06-03 07:32:33 We do
general 2021-06-03 07:32:38 But not that many
general 2021-06-03 07:34:05 Cheeseburgers
general 2021-06-03 07:34:30 Holy shit I can barely fit 2

general 2021-06-03 07:35:26 Yes
general 2021-06-03 07:35:32 And the sauce

general 2021-06-13 21:44:25 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-06-13 21:44:56 It's just a matter of how much effort you put into subjects you will most likely never use again later in life
general 2021-06-13 21:48:08 Aeronautics mechanic moment
general 2021-06-13 21:50:44 4k a month is pretty decent
general 2021-06-13 23:04:27 When the sleep not can 😔
general 2021-06-13 23:05:33 Been to the US twice and it's decent at best
general 2021-06-13 23:05:47 New Orleans is a joke though
general 2021-06-14 09:45:04 A 16 year old also doesn't need drugs or alcohol but guess what, they still use it (sometimes daily)
general 2021-06-14 09:45:23 A car is like lego. It's fun to toy with
general 2021-06-14 09:45:49 Not just a vehicle that gets you somewhere. That wouldn't be fun

the-dump 2021-06-15 06:01:42 sea food
general 2021-06-15 06:03:06 So did someone make mine
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:07:01 You do know posting this image will result in a warning without hesitation?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:07:38 Such marks are very offensive
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:07:50 Hence it's not allowed to show it
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:08:10 Is this a serious question
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:08:42 Rule 8 lo
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:09:56 It reminds people what happened during those times. And let's just say funny mustache man didn't do very appropriate things
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:10:13 Did you seriously expect a kids game to allow NSFW?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:10:19 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:10:35 Plus, this is worse by a margain
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:11:10 Still, 13 year olds don't need to see someone being either skinned alive, having the unholy or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:12:40 Okay so, one of the most brutal conflicts, in which a lot of people suffered, is something you think people snowflake about?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:12:53 The real snowflakes are the ones whining about the covid restrictions
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:14:18 Eeny weeny tiny brain moments happening all the time holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:14:41 This is some actual intelligence right here...
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:16:00 It's suggestive.
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:16:35 It's the dark hour again holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:16:45 Nothing happens when mods are on
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:16:53 but when they go off, shit boutta go down
general 2021-06-15 06:17:45 Actual big brain in <#384021699466756107> saying he wants the german nono symbol to be allowed because "This is a 13+ server"
general 2021-06-15 06:18:19 Like bruh do you seriously think some little baby's are going to take offence to a no no symbol
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:18:44 Pepsi might be online though
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 06:18:51 since late
general 2021-06-15 06:20:17 They only know how to scream at a screen because they lost in a 18+ rated game at the age of 10
general 2021-06-15 06:21:07 I think everyone can agree on the fact that the no no symbol is pretty offensive to most of us
general 2021-06-15 06:23:29 Might just be me hearing a lot of stories about the times under occupation
general 2021-06-15 06:25:22 The place where I lived was a massacre in 1945. I know a lot of old folks living near here that tell absolutely brutal stories on what they did near here
general 2021-06-15 06:26:29 Easy talk for someone who has it's country located halfway across the earth <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-15 06:27:07 Well they did
general 2021-06-15 06:27:09 Japan
general 2021-06-15 06:28:03 I think the primary reason we had to surrender was because they threatened to bomb all our major cities to dust
general 2021-06-15 06:28:46 But we put up a great fight with extremely old equipment and next to no armour divisions
general 2021-06-15 06:29:06 Storeman!!
general 2021-06-15 06:30:05 Down bad
general 2021-06-15 06:30:07 holy shit
general 2021-06-15 06:30:56 He asked me for no no pics in space engineers
general 2021-06-15 06:30:58 lmao
general 2021-06-15 06:31:40 Being gay doesn't mean you have to assault people on the internet
general 2021-06-15 06:32:22 Cringe dutch filter
general 2021-06-15 06:32:31 The Battle of the Schelde
general 2021-06-15 06:32:56 De Oost is great as well
general 2021-06-15 06:33:10 I can stream it some time but not here lol
general 2021-06-15 06:33:30 civil is a meatman!
general 2021-06-15 06:35:01 When the live in same city as jackie
general 2021-06-15 06:36:08 I don't think you need an Anti material rifle for self defence though <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-06-15 06:37:08 I mean like, a 9mm round works better than something that would blow someones head off
general 2021-06-15 06:37:36 I agree, guns can be very fun
general 2021-06-15 06:37:56 But self defence isn't a reason to own one lol
general 2021-06-15 06:38:14 I see it more as a hobby
general 2021-06-15 06:40:37 A big upgrade to give people is knowing where to shoot
general 2021-06-15 06:40:47 Aiming for flesh wounds etc
general 2021-06-15 06:40:57 Not major important organs
general 2021-06-15 06:47:10 In my honest opinion, a 9mm pistol is the maximum in terms of ownership
general 2021-06-15 06:47:43 you don't need a full on arsenal to protect yourself
general 2021-06-15 06:50:55 in PC?
general 2021-06-15 06:51:10 then yes
general 2021-06-15 06:53:41 Plus, ban automatic ownership of private firearms for veterans
general 2021-06-15 06:58:41 No, but I know where Jackie's house is <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-15 07:00:19 Chambering a round and putting the safety off takes some time as well though
general 2021-06-15 07:01:12 Why all these complicated shit

general 2021-06-15 07:04:45 it's that simple
general 2021-06-15 07:05:18 Small towns work just as fine
general 2021-06-15 07:05:33 Less crime, less pay etc
general 2021-06-15 07:06:25 unfortunately yes lol
general 2021-06-15 07:08:11 The difference between the Netherlands and the US is that most crime committed here is from kids under the age of 18 with knives
general 2021-06-15 07:09:27 Communism is a great ideology, but the countries who use/used it got a bad name
general 2021-06-15 07:10:17 This is so true

general 2021-06-18 18:28:20 "ez win 2jz best engine 2000hp stock"
general 2021-06-18 22:35:38 Bruh just face it, the US and Netherlands are both shit in their own ways
general 2021-06-18 22:36:07 "Holland"
general 2021-06-18 22:36:14 Or whatever you'd call it
general 2021-06-18 22:39:59 Actual dorks
general 2021-06-18 22:40:05 Just live with it
general 2021-06-18 22:40:26 Mf's cry when they gotta wear some stupid mask for like 10 minutes
general 2021-06-18 22:41:11 I mean sure, we have them for 1.5 years now and i'm getting tired of them as well
general 2021-06-18 22:41:43 No
general 2021-06-18 22:41:53 That's why everyone needs to wear them
general 2021-06-18 22:42:04 Air gets trapped inside so you don't spread the virus
general 2021-06-18 22:42:11 it's not so you don't get the virus yourself
general 2021-06-18 22:42:30 How do you know if you're infected though
general 2021-06-18 22:42:52 There is a 1 week infection period where symptoms don't show
general 2021-06-18 22:43:38 I have never tested myself
general 2021-06-18 22:43:41 But only got covid once
general 2021-06-18 22:43:57 By illegal
general 2021-06-18 22:44:00 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-18 22:44:28 That is
general 2021-06-18 22:44:31 ok
general 2021-06-18 22:44:46 I'm getting vaccinated soon hopefully
general 2021-06-18 22:45:32 i'd rather have a needle stabbed into me than having to suffer for a longer while
general 2021-06-18 22:45:43 Strong immune system gang
general 2021-06-18 22:47:12 sometimes you have to trust new technology
general 2021-06-18 22:47:16 There is no working around it
general 2021-06-18 22:48:09 Biotech is reliable but shit spread about it and rumours created by convincing karens on facebook spreads like wildfire
general 2021-06-18 22:48:31 Do you seriously think biotech is really unreliable and unsure with the technology we have today?
general 2021-06-18 22:48:48 We're creating so much shit that we as regular citizens haven't even seen yet
general 2021-06-18 22:49:15 I mean i'm fine with you not getting a vaccine
general 2021-06-18 22:49:41 But i'd rather have them test it out on me than on some 6 year old kid
general 2021-06-18 22:50:09 My life is already a mess so it's not that big a problem
general 2021-06-18 22:50:13 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-06-18 22:53:16 If it's humid outside and you got your window open it might spread
general 2021-06-18 22:53:50 It is already
general 2021-06-18 22:53:54 It's just a morale boost
general 2021-06-18 22:54:38 It's 1 cell that does the job
general 2021-06-18 22:54:43 only 1
general 2021-06-18 22:56:40 wait wait
general 2021-06-18 22:56:43 so we are AI now lol
general 2021-06-18 22:56:47 Programmed
general 2021-06-18 22:56:55 Oh yeah okay that makes sense
general 2021-06-18 22:58:15 Just
general 2021-06-18 22:58:22 eat and drink milk products
general 2021-06-18 22:58:38 I drink like a litre of milk each day
general 2021-06-18 22:59:37 Yes, we know
general 2021-06-18 22:59:47 but the thing I want to make clear
general 2021-06-18 22:59:58 If YOU get covid, it will spread like wildfire
general 2021-06-18 23:00:10 you cannot contain it by just sitting in your chair all day
general 2021-06-18 23:00:27 Personal experience
general 2021-06-18 23:01:10 It just boosts the bone cells production hence stronger bones
general 2021-06-18 23:02:12 am I going to die
general 2021-06-18 23:02:26 Because I consume way too much milk related products a day
general 2021-06-18 23:02:31 and i'm no food expert
general 2021-06-18 23:02:56 I'm as slender as one can be
general 2021-06-18 23:03:07 My wrist is literally 4cm thick
general 2021-06-18 23:03:14 Well
general 2021-06-18 23:03:16 hold on
general 2021-06-18 23:03:28 no 3.5cm
general 2021-06-18 23:03:33 from eyesight
general 2021-06-18 23:03:56 I agree with you on that
general 2021-06-18 23:04:03 someone younger might have more use out of it
general 2021-06-18 23:04:10 I got it already
general 2021-06-18 23:04:15 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-06-18 23:04:20 Still got vaccinated though
general 2021-06-18 23:04:22 yeah
general 2021-06-18 23:04:31 but the symptoms sucked ass
general 2021-06-18 23:04:40 but thats just me never being sick
general 2021-06-18 23:04:42 yes
general 2021-06-18 23:04:46 and stuffy nose
general 2021-06-18 23:04:48 and shit
general 2021-06-18 23:05:11 i've never dealt with anything more major than covid before
general 2021-06-18 23:05:16 hence I complain about it
general 2021-06-18 23:05:36 nope
general 2021-06-18 23:05:41 Very strong immune system
general 2021-06-18 23:05:55 Never dealt with that

general 2021-06-23 10:35:50 lol
general 2021-06-23 10:36:05 Might just be me not being familiar with the whole humour
general 2021-06-23 10:36:10 Well, sometimes

general 2021-06-23 10:38:36 What is your ultimate goal

general 2021-06-23 10:43:30 lol
general 2021-06-23 10:44:17 Only reason I would get instagram or any form of social media besided discord is to just use it to teach others what I can do

general 2021-06-24 05:41:58 Mods don't need to give up their real life problems or activities just so they can check general for 4 hours straight. 
Moderators are people as well and jackasses like you expect every mod to take instant action when someone pings them
general 2021-06-24 05:43:30 You just cannot expect a moderator at every time of day.
general 2021-06-24 05:47:02 Maybe leave the server instead of complaining the moderation isn't good enough. Contributing to some unde revolt won't help in the slightest
general 2021-06-24 05:47:34 Its not like you're of use anyway.
general 2021-06-24 05:50:35 Y'alls need a break as mod. Shut this server up for one week and get some rest holy shit what has this server become

A tank cannot drift
general 2021-06-30 08:43:41 It can only slide
general 2021-06-30 08:44:47 the science?
Tank treads have too much friction and the drive train has too few torque to actually make them skid. Something that is not skidding is not considdered a drift

general 2021-06-30 10:32:19 It's really fucking simple:
YOU might think it's good
but OTHERS might think it isn't
general 2021-06-30 10:32:36 And since they can express their opinion on your builds, nothing can stop them from disliking it
general 2021-06-30 10:33:29 I'd say yes
general 2021-06-30 10:34:40 If this is just some roblox plane game, why are you getting mad about your builds being disliked

general 2021-06-30 10:38:39 Your argument is literally about upvotes on people with 'i'm new' above their creations.
As far as i'm concerned I know pretty well what this is all about
general 2021-06-30 10:38:59 The community thinks otherwise
general 2021-06-30 10:39:17 It's really fucking simple

general 2021-09-20 14:01:28 I've never delved into the Skyline culture so nope

general 2021-09-21 07:47:12 Yes but unlike Germany the USA has like a '20% of all infrastructure needs to be fast food restaurants' policy

general 2021-10-04 07:34:42 F-35 is in my opinion a better looking F-22
general 2021-10-04 07:35:03 The F-22 just looks like a flying semi truck. It's just too fat
general 2021-10-04 07:41:08 Jets in general are not my favourite planes. Props is where it's at
general 2021-10-04 07:41:38 Better sound and you actually visually see the engine(s) doing something
general 2021-10-04 07:42:17 Peacemaker looks decent but it's a late bomber which practically makes it useless
general 2021-10-04 07:43:54 Yes but speed is the problem
general 2021-10-04 07:44:51 How will it bomb with jets that are 4 times faster shooting it down 30km away from the target
general 2021-10-04 07:55:29 Who unde
general 2021-10-04 07:57:13 Still bannable

general 2021-10-05 06:39:55 Agreed
general 2021-10-05 06:40:58 It handles fine in uptiers
general 2021-10-05 06:41:13 M42 is good against planes
general 2021-10-05 06:41:37 Both are good
general 2021-10-05 06:43:32 Find cover behind mountains/hills. Get to a building/high rock and circle it if a plane strafes you. If it flies past, shoot it.

general 2021-10-05 06:45:59 Is high tier so idc
general 2021-10-05 06:46:12 8.0 is high
general 2021-10-05 06:47:05 Not if you play the US and get uptiered to 9.0 every time you play
general 2021-10-05 06:47:36 Germany is basically playing on easy mode
general 2021-10-05 06:47:48 Same with the US at lower tiers
general 2021-10-05 06:50:30 Drift build?
general 2021-10-05 06:51:02 Ah I see

general 2021-10-05 07:40:13 I really gotta visit Aussieland some time
general 2021-10-05 07:41:06 I mean, i've seen a tiny bit of it's car culture and i'd visit solely for the wildlife you guys have
general 2021-10-05 07:42:21 It's American, but so American it isn't American anymore
general 2021-10-05 07:46:37 How big do you want your turbo? **Y E S**
general 2021-10-05 07:47:13 American culture, but extreme
general 2021-10-05 07:47:22 And I 100% support it
general 2021-10-05 07:47:53 Meanwhile, we have blastpipes on Celica's, Seat's etc
general 2021-10-05 07:48:08 223hp Audi TT's etc
general 2021-10-05 07:48:42 I'll be at Japfest (legal car meet) this Sunday
general 2021-10-05 07:49:15 I will not be sharing meets I go to because I do not want to risk my drivers license again
general 2021-10-05 07:49:22 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-10-05 07:51:12 Found a video of the usual meets we have
general 2021-10-05 07:51:14 https://youtu.be/92LXWq6yYBU
general 2021-10-05 07:53:41 Don't know why this culture seems so boring to me. It's exiting but boring at the same time.
general 2021-10-05 07:56:25 yep
general 2021-10-05 07:56:59 There are some jems here and there but mostly just cheap sports cars with a few mods
general 2021-10-05 07:57:32 Jup.
general 2021-10-05 07:58:09 Going to buy an MR-S soon though. Need to find one from 2003+ though lol
general 2021-10-05 07:58:59 At least that looks like somethings been done to it lol
general 2021-10-05 07:59:04 Delete that.
general 2021-10-05 07:59:05 Please.
general 2021-10-05 07:59:42 I do need to find a 2003 model though... 1ZZ engines from >2003 have tonnes of oil problems
general 2021-10-05 08:01:38 WOawI
general 2021-10-05 08:02:01 American imported
general 2021-10-05 08:02:45 I see. Thought you guys imported a tonne from the US
general 2021-10-05 08:03:00 And since pretty much no one drives stick in the US it would make sense
general 2021-10-05 08:03:31 That's a very clean bay damn
general 2021-10-05 08:04:11 What is that on the bridge?
general 2021-10-05 08:04:24 cool
general 2021-10-05 08:04:42 Very nice!
general 2021-10-05 08:05:03 Make it un-advertise ty
general 2021-10-05 08:06:09 Mechanic is a job I cannot get bored of. Don't know about you but if you aren't able to get the job you want mechanic is a solid second choice.
general 2021-10-05 08:06:35 It pays fine over here
general 2021-10-05 08:10:13 Programming pays good
general 2021-10-05 08:10:29 Side job of making websites as well.
general 2021-10-05 08:12:01 Aftermarket shops are hard to start though
general 2021-10-05 08:13:51 You need to acquire some parts first though
general 2021-10-05 08:13:59 Without stock a business cannot be started
general 2021-10-05 08:19:05 Start with some cheap shit like motor oil etc. Near a track that would be perfect. If it picks up, try bodywork parts etc
general 2021-10-05 08:20:18 Guess so
general 2021-10-05 08:21:27 pls gib mone i want cars go brum
general 2021-10-05 08:21:35 :DDD
general 2021-10-05 08:22:11 I mean if you plan on staying in Aussie land it's a start
general 2021-10-05 08:22:35 Pretty easy to do
general 2021-10-05 08:22:59 But make sure you get a good 4 banger because that thing looks like all 4 cylinders are about to pop
general 2021-10-05 08:23:32 Or it's just the tyre set they equipped it with
general 2021-10-05 08:23:49 That's sick
general 2021-10-05 08:24:25 Whole class boutta pull up in the school's lowrider
general 2021-10-05 08:24:45 Looks good!
general 2021-10-05 08:25:37 Does it have enough froom for it?
general 2021-10-05 08:25:44 The van you want to fit it in
general 2021-10-05 08:25:58 That's always step one
general 2021-10-05 08:26:07 Ah I see
general 2021-10-05 08:26:25 That should fit, but might be difficult with the turbo set
general 2021-10-05 08:26:33 Depends on how big you want to go
general 2021-10-05 08:27:03 That's tight
general 2021-10-05 08:27:13 It's a mini van so yes
general 2021-10-05 08:27:30 holy shit haha
general 2021-10-05 08:27:48 Those pipes lool

general 2021-10-05 08:29:57 Worst muscle car...
general 2021-10-05 08:30:06 I mean, I only remember the ones I like
general 2021-10-05 08:31:33 Most of them are nice
general 2021-10-05 08:32:18 Oe yes show me
general 2021-10-05 08:33:03 Mostly interested in Japanese cars because of the looks
general 2021-10-05 08:33:56 That looks sick
general 2021-10-05 08:35:36 I don't like sharing meets I go to because too much happens
general 2021-10-05 08:35:48 But I have done a really calm meet recently
general 2021-10-05 08:36:29 Also, new integra teaser

general 2021-10-05 08:45:30 TRUE
general 2021-10-05 08:47:12 That's setting financial priorities is it not?

general 2021-10-05 08:50:09 That's about 1 dollar 70
general 2021-10-05 08:50:47 Even on the Airbase I worked for about a year I had to pay for lunch etc
general 2021-10-05 08:51:33 Let me guess: the rest is all too dry?
general 2021-10-05 08:53:13 I mean, correct
general 2021-10-05 08:53:57 Ayo ayo stop flexing on me
general 2021-10-05 08:54:15 I legit had to pay 1,10 euro's for a Twix bar
general 2021-10-05 08:54:32 When winter
general 2021-10-05 08:54:48 Not a bargain to say the least... It's ripping people off so bad
general 2021-10-05 08:55:17 I mean, it'll probably be the same as last year since PC2 is being worked on
general 2021-10-05 08:55:51 Don't know how expensive Mcdonalds is for you guys
general 2021-10-05 08:56:02 I pay like what, 10 euro's for a meal?
general 2021-10-05 08:56:27 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2021-10-05 08:56:46 Understandable.
general 2021-10-05 08:57:49 If it's far i'd just stay at campus as well
general 2021-10-05 08:58:15 My previous school was located pretty shitty. Had to take a train to the nearest Mcdonalds
general 2021-10-05 08:58:35 The jealousy is starting to kick in
general 2021-10-05 08:59:21 When I lost my drivers license I had to take the train and bus to my school
general 2021-10-05 08:59:27 Which was like 2 hours away by car
general 2021-10-05 08:59:50 Apocalypse tank from RA3
general 2021-10-05 09:00:06 Depends on how big the candy is
general 2021-10-05 09:00:13 Hammer tank from RA3
general 2021-10-05 09:00:42 Mecha tengu for a challenge
general 2021-10-05 09:02:23 Wait what
general 2021-10-05 09:02:31 They tax us on everything here
general 2021-10-05 09:02:49 How does that work what
general 2021-10-05 09:03:00 Man I fucking hate this economy of ours now
general 2021-10-05 09:04:12 Making room for the F-14 probably because every is demanding for it
general 2021-10-05 09:04:47 Jumbo is the same BR as the Super Pershing
general 2021-10-05 09:04:50 Remember that
general 2021-10-05 09:04:56 Is it not?
general 2021-10-05 09:05:03 bruh
general 2021-10-05 09:06:01 It's screwing up the up/downtiers way beyond what is balanced
general 2021-10-05 09:06:30 Either remove the up/down tier matchmaking system, or make it so that it is +/- 0.3BR capped
general 2021-10-05 09:06:41 Because the dumb tiger players don't angle
general 2021-10-05 09:06:55 So all the Jumbo's have it easy and kill them all easily
general 2021-10-05 09:07:21 Ride into battle, get one kill, die and repeat
general 2021-10-05 09:07:30 Or play the KV-2 and die instantly
general 2021-10-05 09:08:09 True. But the 75 won't be as reliable on 5.3
general 2021-10-05 09:08:28 Best to have it for the T-34 1942
general 2021-10-05 09:08:39 It made my Soviet grind so much easier
general 2021-10-05 09:08:50 Boat probs lol
general 2021-10-05 09:09:19 I believe I have like 4 talismans on random boats I will never use
general 2021-10-05 09:09:57 I never had any financial issues surprisingly
general 2021-10-05 09:10:20 Mid tier realistic can be fun, but you have uptiers way too often
general 2021-10-05 09:10:37 Unless you're playing gaijins baby child AKA Germany
general 2021-10-05 09:10:50 The F2 is such a good tank indeed
general 2021-10-05 09:11:08 I do enjoy T-34's more though.
general 2021-10-05 09:11:16 Mostly the ones at 3.7
general 2021-10-05 09:11:49 It's more versatile than the F2
general 2021-10-05 09:12:03 Don't grind air lol
general 2021-10-05 09:12:28 True.
general 2021-10-05 09:12:52 The IS-1 is shit lol
general 2021-10-05 09:13:01 Better off with the KV-85
general 2021-10-05 09:13:23 Ah yes, is night for US
general 2021-10-05 09:13:31 Cya

general 2021-10-05 11:49:43 Reason being the game is aimed to be NSFW
general 2021-10-05 11:51:14 Let me state it this way: If you are able to draw without restrictions, would you still not draw NSFW?

general 2021-10-05 12:26:43 I'll note that down
general 2021-10-05 12:34:29 That's why it's such a challenge
general 2021-10-05 12:34:41 sure thing
general 2021-10-05 12:37:00 It'll be put in the filter soon. I suggest linking it in private communities :)

general 2021-10-11 09:57:28 hi
general 2021-10-11 09:58:32 That's a sound I really fear
general 2021-10-11 10:07:17 Time to put the hands in the air because you are going to probably die
general 2021-10-11 10:10:36 The angle the car is angled at does not make any sense. It should oversteer so bad your car will loose all of it's traction
general 2021-10-11 10:17:06 Braking is the only way he could've recovered
general 2021-10-11 10:17:26 Stop the back wheels from spinning and he got his traction back partly
general 2021-10-11 10:17:45 Then accelerated a bit and got out of the spin
general 2021-10-11 10:31:32 Wow! A crime!
general 2021-10-11 11:18:10 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2021-10-11 11:46:26 It's a Toyota
general 2021-10-11 11:46:49 But people saying that it's a Porsche makes the car even better
general 2021-10-11 11:48:32 What if, i'll do a pro gamer move and put some Porsche wheels and Porsche badge on my MR-S and call it a day? <@456226577798135808>

general 2021-10-11 11:49:37 Think of how many girls I would get
general 2021-10-11 11:49:49 Chadon will become a reality
general 2021-10-11 11:50:31 When the joke is being overlooked by literally everyone
general 2021-10-11 11:50:40 You know your humour is shit
general 2021-10-11 11:51:30 Porsches are ugly so I don't want to know more about them lol
general 2021-10-11 11:52:47 Unlike the designers of Porsche, I actually know that about myself
general 2021-10-11 11:52:54 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-10-11 11:53:26 I really couldn't give less of a shit about my looks tbh, I'm not aiming to be the best looking guy around
general 2021-10-11 11:54:06 You're the one that threw the female look into it bruh
general 2021-10-11 11:55:01 He just wants a femboy friend
general 2021-10-11 11:55:02 that's all
general 2021-10-11 11:55:58 I don't need to, because arguing over literally the smallest things is immature to the max
general 2021-10-11 11:56:02 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-10-11 11:56:30 Man, you type before you think lol
general 2021-10-11 11:57:39 Just trying to have a casual conversation and I can't even do that anymore lol
general 2021-10-11 11:57:52 Back to work I go
general 2021-10-11 12:01:33 And here, ladies and gentlemen, we see the reason unfolding on why literally every well-known person left this hellish place in the first place
general 2021-10-11 12:03:35 I do
general 2021-10-11 12:04:46 It's not about the game, but about the community
general 2021-10-11 12:05:06 This community just turns people into a toxic wasteland lol
general 2021-10-11 12:06:44 Not saying everyone is. There is a bunch of cool people still with us, but the majority isn't by a long shot
general 2021-10-11 12:07:09 :)
general 2021-10-11 12:09:25 ^
general 2021-10-11 12:09:52 "skill issue" "wow no motorlock noob" "shit creation wow low effort warn"
general 2021-10-11 12:12:14 Back when motorlock didn't exist in every build possible
general 2021-10-11 12:13:41 About that yes
general 2021-10-11 12:13:47 Now look where we are
general 2021-10-11 12:14:42 I acknowledge that to myself as well, but I understand that it was PCC's high expectations that made me act that way
general 2021-10-11 12:14:58 Luckily i've grown out of that because of personal reasons lol
general 2021-10-11 12:15:11 No, something else
general 2021-10-11 12:15:19 But that is not to be discussed
general 2021-10-11 12:15:22 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-10-11 12:16:55 I felt myself obligated to act more mature when I became moderator lol
general 2021-10-11 12:17:33 Well, I still don't know if i'll be promoted to mod. They might as well demote me after my trail is over
general 2021-10-11 12:18:08 I'll just be chill with most things. I just gotta deal with the few gremlings we have in here
general 2021-10-11 12:18:47 Lol true
general 2021-10-11 12:21:31 One shining moment I figured out, is that my "Plane Crazy Moderator Nature Documentary" got acknowledged by Fonkl lol
general 2021-10-11 12:22:16 It's a file
general 2021-10-11 12:23:09 Sure
general 2021-10-11 12:38:43 They only accepted me because of my active moderator hours LO
general 2021-10-11 17:10:23 How is one part time depressed
general 2021-10-11 17:10:42 I think he meant 'part time attention grabber'
general 2021-10-11 17:11:03 This man probably does so
general 2021-10-11 17:14:00 Tactical depression
general 2021-10-12 05:35:25 Fun fact: you are but your brain. Everything around it is to keep you, the brain, alive.
general 2021-10-12 05:36:00 Critical thing needed for your brain is gone
general 2021-10-12 06:51:25 <@456226577798135808> Also, change the big funny filtered word in your bio ty

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:40:40 Also, that rod on the front is something F-35's do not have
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:41:21 I have motorlocked when making tank treads but that's pretty much it
general 2021-10-12 07:44:25 Looks pretty good ngl
general 2021-10-12 07:45:03 I would see the Germans coming up with this
general 2021-10-12 07:46:43 These are scary ngl
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:47:57 You can if you leak it here

plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:50:26 It's not known to me and if RBK allows it I guess it's fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:50:33 Rules might've changed or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:51:42 I'll check with actual mods. It'll take a while before they will respond though since all Canadians are asleep
general 2021-10-12 07:54:39 I would see this happening

general 2021-10-12 07:56:25 Ignoring is not an option this time

the-dump 2021-10-12 08:27:21 No, it's some random angry little Call of Duty rager that didn't like being told he had to change his status
the-dump 2021-10-12 08:27:41 Gave him clear instructions and he was acting stupid. Nothing to worry about

general 2021-10-12 08:40:23 I've met people that act really immature and I am as well. It's really weird but real
general 2021-10-12 08:41:06 Paindelaide
general 2021-10-12 08:42:54 Keeping up to date with the Asians and Aussies is tiring at the moment lol
general 2021-10-12 08:44:31 The annoyance of 'The Netherlands' being referred to as "HoLlaNd"
general 2021-10-12 08:44:51 It's a province
general 2021-10-12 08:44:56 Not a country
general 2021-10-12 08:45:01 Yes
general 2021-10-12 08:51:14 I think asians would enjoy most Dutch meals to be honest

general 2021-10-12 08:52:29 Mashed potatoes with lettuce
general 2021-10-12 08:52:44 Mashed potatoes with onion and carrot
general 2021-10-12 08:53:08 We have potatoes added to literally everything
general 2021-10-12 08:53:44 Also this
general 2021-10-12 08:54:08 This sort of meal is tradition in most families here, A type of fish, meat or chicken with any form of potatoes and some greenery
general 2021-10-12 08:55:06 Hate me all you want, but meat is overrated
general 2021-10-12 08:56:00 Hard to chew, usually full of shit that tastes so bad and it takes up so much time
general 2021-10-12 08:56:52 I enjoy either chicken or fish, but usually fish because I cannot cook for shit and i'll probably give myself food poisoning if I even try chicken
general 2021-10-12 08:57:26 Soft and no bone
general 2021-10-12 08:58:04 Bone is just too much work for me to chew around. You want to chomp down on a juicy leg for example and your chomp is stopped by that damn bone
general 2021-10-12 08:58:33 I want my plate ready to eat
general 2021-10-12 08:58:39 Same way I do not like shrimp
general 2021-10-12 08:59:06 Who goes to a diner and decides 'Ah yes, let me choose the meal that requires effort for me to eat'
general 2021-10-12 08:59:36 It's just too much work lol
general 2021-10-12 08:59:54 Sea food is my favourite
general 2021-10-12 09:00:18 Sushi, fish, crab, octopus
general 2021-10-12 09:00:41 As long as it is solid and not combined in soup like most asian countries do, I like it
general 2021-10-12 09:01:14 Aight, Tinon cooking stream, should I do?

general 2021-10-15 05:32:43 Lo
general 2021-10-15 05:32:58 Ok bye
general 2021-10-15 07:00:00 concrete muncher
general 2021-10-15 07:00:07 hi
general 2021-10-15 07:00:17 Yes
general 2021-10-15 07:00:25 But a van almost hit me B)
general 2021-10-15 07:00:42 Is my active hours so yes
general 2021-10-15 07:10:12 I honestly think the map is finished already and it's just the game mechanics that need to be worked on as of now
general 2021-10-15 07:10:31 I could be entirely wrong though
general 2021-10-15 07:10:52 4 emotes is the cap
general 2021-10-15 07:11:11 We all want a new map, you just gotta be patient
general 2021-10-15 07:11:38 bana wo!
general 2021-10-15 07:12:06 You can get banned from this server yes
general 2021-10-15 07:12:50 Light tanks and just fucking about doing the derp
general 2021-10-15 07:13:37 Well yes, but I can't see the outline of other tanks that way
general 2021-10-15 07:14:18 I agree on the fact that the servers and mechanics are absolute poopoo
general 2021-10-15 07:14:33 Sometimes I get angry at the game as well because of some stupid shit that killed me
general 2021-10-15 07:14:52 Or just one singular guy that just decides to camp the whole game
general 2021-10-15 07:15:17 But most of the time I just toy with the enemies
general 2021-10-15 07:16:29 Yeah, the grind is the downside
general 2021-10-15 07:16:52 Low tier can be real fun if you have a heavy tank or super fast tank though
general 2021-10-15 07:17:40 Char B1
general 2021-10-15 07:18:03 Or if you want something more challenging, play the StuH 42
general 2021-10-15 07:18:51 IS-1 is a tank I have yet to really play, but from what i've heard, it barely stops anything
general 2021-10-15 07:19:11 You'll be playing against 88's which don't even care where you hit
general 2021-10-15 07:19:16 you'll die
general 2021-10-15 07:19:27 T-34's are real fun though

general 2021-10-15 07:21:16 The Jumbo is a blessing
general 2021-10-15 07:21:39 Do hide your plates behind the tracks though
general 2021-10-15 07:22:10 It's cringe
general 2021-10-15 07:22:24 The 76 is not worth it
general 2021-10-15 07:22:51 I suggest not sticking around at 5.7 for long if you enjoy chill gameplay though
general 2021-10-15 07:23:08 M18 can be fun though but that's just because I like going fast
general 2021-10-15 07:24:45 Just stay in cover from the enemy as much as possible while moving and find a position which is extremely cringe before firing
general 2021-10-15 07:24:55 And take out the last tank first
general 2021-10-15 07:24:58 always
general 2021-10-15 07:25:23 The rest won't know that someone died
general 2021-10-15 07:26:24 I don't get it either
general 2021-10-15 07:26:42 Once you get to about 7.0 it's just pain and misery
general 2021-10-15 07:27:20 ATGM bullshit and APFSDS click and kill gameplay
general 2021-10-15 07:28:24 6.7 is pretty fun for the US

general 2021-10-18 12:06:18 I don't have a grudge against the wheel size per se though
general 2021-10-18 12:06:34 The wheels are all the same size which is great
general 2021-10-18 12:07:02 Very cool body parts, but it's not my style.
general 2021-10-18 12:07:22 That must weigh about what 600kg?

general 2021-10-18 12:27:16 I can buy one for like 7k euro's but it's a track modified one
general 2021-10-18 12:27:33 I don't think it's road legal and it must have a tonne of internal problems
general 2021-10-18 12:27:50 Won't work for me
general 2021-10-18 12:27:55 But the MR-S is decent
general 2021-10-18 12:54:30 It's probably 80% done by now
general 2021-10-18 12:54:47 It'll take about 3 to 4 more months probably
general 2021-10-18 12:55:03 It's just a guess of mine
general 2021-10-18 12:55:14 Since rick announced it was 75% done by then

general 2021-10-19 07:19:04 Silent as can be (unless you give it way to much attention like me), are extremely clean, will always want your attention, will be even funnier than dogs, you can leave them at home in a cage and it costs basically nothing
general 2021-10-19 07:19:30 Only cons are the fur that is everywhere and they may nibble on furniture

general 2021-11-02 09:49:51 I like this, but the colour doesn't work
general 2021-11-02 09:51:27 Just decrease the gloss to almost matte and replace the colour to a rose/cream colour
general 2021-11-02 09:51:28 I mean true, but I have an opinion on it as well
general 2021-11-02 09:52:04 And if you have the money to buy a car like that, you have the money to make it look nicer
general 2021-11-02 09:52:30 I remember that car! Didn't he get sued or whatever

general 2021-11-02 11:37:34 Good
general 2021-11-02 11:37:58 A bit isn't really a big bummer
general 2021-11-02 11:38:45 When you get your grubby little 15 year old hands on a mature friend, you know that alcohol is what you're after

general 2021-11-03 14:58:28 Thing is, I like big vents
general 2021-11-03 14:59:05 Big, open vents makes it look like it belongs on a race track
general 2021-11-03 14:59:51 If you're called Tinon, you can reach 130
general 2021-11-03 15:00:02 in my honest opinion yes
general 2021-11-03 15:00:10 It makes it more aggressive looking
general 2021-11-03 15:00:21 I've lost my license before

general 2021-11-05 08:19:23 those are very shitty
general 2021-11-05 08:19:29 I can't swallow those as well
general 2021-11-05 08:19:32 and they hurt like hell
general 2021-11-05 08:20:11 Try asking your doctor for tablets
general 2021-11-05 08:20:52 Whenever I have trouble with medicines I always crush the tablets with 2 spoons and drink a **tonne** of water
general 2021-11-05 08:21:04 and some juice as well
general 2021-11-05 08:21:42 it burst open in your throat didn't it
general 2021-11-05 08:22:42 I think it did
general 2021-11-05 08:23:57 Honestly, i'd have no idea
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 08:49:10 <@!703448439186391091> hi, please don't post that in here
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 08:49:22 if you have trouble with it, DM a moderator about it
general 2021-11-05 08:50:05 ^
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:13:10 the entire thing should be a bit wider
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:14:07 It's too slim for an F-16
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:14:38 I doubt that, or the camera angle makes it super slim
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:16:15 The nose is not circular, the front should be flatter and the intake should be wider as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:16:39 But then again, I suck at building myself
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:17:03 
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:28:57 I'll be honest, it looks more like something out of Ace Combat
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:30:20 I'd say continue with this current plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:30:34 And make it the 'Lazer' from GTAV instead
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 10:31:51 Just an F-16 with a twin rudder setup and a different intake

general 2021-11-08 07:36:04 Maybe in PC2
general 2021-11-08 07:36:11 But I don't know
general 2021-11-08 07:38:01 Given locked motors don't compact no more as the video suggests, it wouldn't even be possible
general 2021-11-08 07:39:22 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/529858892075761694/907091263017340928
general 2021-11-08 07:40:23 I don't see it being compacted though
general 2021-11-08 07:41:10 It would be a seperate feature of motors then
general 2021-11-08 07:41:49 I don't know how locked motors work. Last time I turned a locked motor it compacted back into itself
general 2021-11-08 07:42:00 Thursdqy
general 2021-11-08 07:42:49 As in rotation?
general 2021-11-08 07:43:11 Or no clipping through the base
general 2021-11-08 07:44:36 Yes but does it turn back on its rotation axis or does it no-clip through its base
general 2021-11-08 07:45:03 Then its fixed yes
general 2021-11-08 07:45:11 No more locked motors once you turn it
general 2021-11-08 07:45:36 Ahhh alright
general 2021-11-08 07:45:57 I guess we'll see

general 2021-11-12 08:50:54 Scots and Brits have the best accent in English
general 2021-11-12 08:56:56 Fun fact: American accent was to be because it cost a tonne of money to print the entire English words
general 2021-11-12 08:57:19 So in other words, American accent is just a cheap version of the British one
general 2021-11-12 08:57:54 Another fun fact: I get mistaken for being British when I speak in VC every time I meet a new person

general 2021-11-12 13:19:35 Yes
general 2021-11-12 13:20:02 The suspension needed some stiffer coils, and the rear has barely any room now
general 2021-11-12 13:20:44 Untrue

general 2021-11-15 22:33:39 You can fit a V8 in a MX-5 but it would be a deathtrap of a vehicle

general 2021-11-15 22:38:18 Yes, but the speed
general 2021-11-15 22:39:17 Of course, but why would you want that much speed in a MX-5
general 2021-11-15 22:40:08 MX-5's are cheap cars with a very good aftermarket
general 2021-11-15 22:40:25 + BMW's are quite expensive to maintain

general 2021-11-15 22:48:17 I should buy an MR-2 soon, but there aren't any good ones on the market as of now :(
general 2021-11-15 22:51:23 At least it has a gearbox

general 2021-11-23 08:13:22 I've also found my perfect car
general 2021-11-23 08:13:39 MR-S
general 2021-11-23 08:14:00 Really affordable, 190k km with a hardtop included
general 2021-11-23 08:14:03 yep
general 2021-11-23 08:14:19 It's really stable
general 2021-11-23 08:14:26 More so than an MX-5
general 2021-11-23 08:14:30 Or Miata
general 2021-11-23 08:14:34 Whatever you prefer
general 2021-11-23 08:14:46 Same here
general 2021-11-23 08:14:56 MX-5 is just
general 2021-11-23 08:15:00 Superior in every way
general 2021-11-23 08:15:01 lol
general 2021-11-23 08:15:21 I also had an MX-3 and MX-6 that looked interesting
general 2021-11-23 08:15:28 And some Ford Probe's
general 2021-11-23 08:15:32 But they all lack power
general 2021-11-23 08:16:08 Civic's are reliable, but very prone to rust
general 2021-11-23 08:17:51 Still won't buy FH5 until someone other than microsoft handles the servers
general 2021-11-23 08:17:59 Which I know won't happen
general 2021-11-23 08:18:27 I could get in online on FH4 but one day it just decided that, no
general 2021-11-23 08:18:39 Did basically everything imaginable
general 2021-11-23 08:18:45 And I am still unable to access online
general 2021-11-23 08:18:52 Wasted like 80 euro's
general 2021-11-23 08:19:19 FH5 looks great, it's very fun
general 2021-11-23 08:19:24 But the servers are just
general 2021-11-23 08:19:31 Not worth the money man...
general 2021-11-23 08:32:30 hi
general 2021-11-23 08:48:50 You got Forza'd
general 2021-11-23 08:51:18 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2021-11-23 08:53:45 Make it gold/beige with flat racing rims
general 2021-11-23 08:53:49 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-11-23 08:58:53 I do not like
general 2021-11-23 08:59:06 But still the 70's rims which is nice
general 2021-11-23 08:59:28 I don't like the skirts and bumpers
general 2021-11-23 08:59:31 hi
general 2021-11-23 09:00:30 what
general 2021-11-23 09:00:42 Do as you like
general 2021-11-23 09:01:05 Don't take it from me, just my opinion on it.
general 2021-11-23 09:01:13 I am basically a cleanfreak when it comes to cars
general 2021-11-23 09:01:21 But there are some exceptions
general 2021-11-23 09:01:55 <@456226577798135808> Such as this
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451026663913029642/905470146204823592/20210322091731-f6a0-wm-7532.png
general 2021-11-23 09:02:21 This widebody is pretty much the only one I fell in love with
general 2021-11-23 09:02:52 Only downside to the kit is the fake vented front
general 2021-11-23 09:03:02 Engine is behind the driver, not in front so like what
general 2021-11-23 09:05:29 Ride height is perfect for me. If there is a larger ducktail for it, try adding it
general 2021-11-23 09:06:07 Don't know how well the colours are in FH5, but a little darker red would do for me
general 2021-11-23 09:06:19 Gives me that retro feel
general 2021-11-23 09:09:48 Perfect
general 2021-11-23 09:10:18 Maybe I can give you some pictures of some clean retro cars I made in GTAV

general 2021-11-23 14:09:43 I knew the Opel Speedster existed
general 2021-11-23 14:10:15 Fast, yes

general 2021-11-23 14:10:31 Very
general 2021-11-23 14:11:04 This has to be the best car Opel had produced post 2000's

general 2021-11-23 14:13:06 Better description would be a light BMW

general 2021-11-23 15:47:24 Ty
general 2021-11-23 15:50:01 Alright, let me make it clear. In this server, you can only speak English. Not because we are selfish yanks, but because the English language is international.
general 2021-11-23 15:50:37 That is what I said
general 2021-11-23 15:52:10 Then we would have to create about 500 different channels. Use English only.
general 2021-11-23 15:52:52 We are not racist by any means, but rules are rules. Start respecting them or I won't respect you.
general 2021-11-23 15:54:56 I'm going to correct you as well, the language you are speaking is Portuguese

general 2021-11-24 12:42:38 Yes, 86's were pretty much in every racing type

general 2021-11-30 08:24:06 Can't assume their gender
general 2021-11-30 08:25:37 It's what I use at the museum
general 2021-11-30 08:25:47 They have no right to get pissed at me then lol
general 2021-11-30 08:41:51 You're not calling them anything
general 2021-11-30 08:42:00 That's the big brainer
general 2021-11-30 08:42:46 You don't want to know how many times people have gone over to my superiors because I misgendered them
general 2021-11-30 08:44:39 Most of them are 50+ of age so they don't like those people complaining
general 2021-11-30 08:44:46 But for museums sake they must comply
general 2021-11-30 08:46:32 My brain is committing implosion

general 2021-11-30 08:49:39 Stop talking about self harm
general 2021-11-30 08:50:02 Because it's not pleasing the blokes in here
general 2021-11-30 08:51:05 We had a 206 before I had my license
general 2021-11-30 08:51:51 The Race cars they build are quite cool
general 2021-11-30 08:52:07 But I dislike the civilian market cars they produce(d)
general 2021-11-30 08:54:02 Ground vehicles are cheap, easy to work on and quite fast
general 2021-11-30 08:55:18 Yes, and you will never own something that goes beyond 400kmh lol
general 2021-11-30 08:56:51 You'll be in charge of maintenance, fuel, a place to store it and most importantly, a flying license
general 2021-11-30 08:57:04 All of this will easily cost you about 3 million a year
general 2021-11-30 08:59:13 I think you can legally get one, however with very much effort
general 2021-11-30 08:59:29 Can you drop the topic, that's what i'll say
general 2021-11-30 08:59:49 Quite amazing
general 2021-11-30 09:00:57 If you ever go go-karting, you'll learn how amazing cars and racing actually is
general 2021-11-30 09:01:30 Racing lines, going as fast as you can and being in full control of whatever you're in is a thrill of it's own
general 2021-11-30 09:02:19 Get Asseto Corsa then

general 2021-12-03 09:26:13 But it's in <#497142796961054721> unfortunately
general 2021-12-03 09:26:24 Le shitpost go to <#495286269459300364>
general 2021-12-03 09:26:51 hi
general 2021-12-03 09:28:15 Do you mean a kitchen workshop or woman driving event?
general 2021-12-03 09:29:07 I do not no
general 2021-12-03 11:14:53 He would be dead by now
general 2021-12-03 12:29:41 German WW2 stuff and MBT's
general 2021-12-03 12:30:16 F-22 or the F-15
general 2021-12-03 12:30:42 I've seen more F-15's than F-18's
general 2021-12-03 12:30:51 F-16 reigns supreme though
general 2021-12-03 12:32:04 That would be either the Supra Mk4 or the Skyline '34
general 2021-12-03 12:32:14 Clickbait cars
general 2021-12-03 12:32:31 Lambo isn't overrated
general 2021-12-03 12:32:46 But that's the cars that people automatically assume a super car
general 2021-12-03 12:33:14 McLarens at least look better
general 2021-12-03 12:33:19 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-03 12:33:28 hi
general 2021-12-03 12:33:59 I can confirm this isn't true
general 2021-12-03 12:34:09 The 2020 GT looks damn fine as well
general 2021-12-03 12:34:42 
general 2021-12-03 12:35:16 Both of these are amazing
general 2021-12-03 12:35:28 Compared to Ferrari or Lambo's
general 2021-12-03 12:36:00 Yes, but obviously not from this era
general 2021-12-03 12:36:07 We are talking modern cars
general 2021-12-03 12:36:35 Untrue, they are quite fast
general 2021-12-03 12:37:19 Yes but compare the prices
general 2021-12-03 12:37:20 lol
general 2021-12-03 12:37:27 Zenvo is just unreliable
general 2021-12-03 12:38:01 Peugeot makes some killer race cars
general 2021-12-03 12:38:41 Cabrio's are fun to drive though
general 2021-12-03 12:38:53 + you can get a hardtop with it
general 2021-12-03 12:39:10 Is it purely looks or driving joy?
general 2021-12-03 12:39:25 Because there is nothing better than a lowered roof in the summer
general 2021-12-03 12:40:33 Have you seen the new logo though
general 2021-12-03 12:41:04 They have a sports car logo
general 2021-12-03 12:41:35 Car itself is fun, but the colour scheme is shit I agree
general 2021-12-03 12:42:36 HOW
general 2021-12-03 12:42:41 ok the civic I can understand
general 2021-12-03 12:42:49 But the Integra looks awesome if done well
general 2021-12-03 12:42:59 Only the brick headlights though
general 2021-12-03 12:43:06 Not the 4 eyed one
general 2021-12-03 12:43:45 (He hates JDM cars because they are overrated)
general 2021-12-03 12:44:13 I disagree though. They are cheap, reliable and most underappreciated ones look good
general 2021-12-03 12:45:43 It does
general 2021-12-03 12:45:52 It's got a fat front with a overpriced engine
general 2021-12-03 12:46:30 Also, <@!389756407483990028>
general 2021-12-03 12:46:47 It's a good weird
general 2021-12-03 12:47:01 Done well they look amazing
general 2021-12-03 12:47:48 Still can't wait for the new MR-2 Toyota is developing atm
general 2021-12-03 12:48:00 600bhp hybrid
general 2021-12-03 12:49:04 Unreliable source told me
general 2021-12-03 12:49:12 But I am hoping it does
general 2021-12-03 12:49:30 Wait wait
general 2021-12-03 12:49:33 Why would you ever
general 2021-12-03 12:49:53 Put a Subaru engine, especially the impreza's, on another car
general 2021-12-03 12:50:19 It's still better than that boxer 4
general 2021-12-03 12:50:32 That stuff breaks within 30 days
general 2021-12-03 12:50:52 Are you sure it's one of the WRX cars
general 2021-12-03 12:50:58 Or just the 90bhp engines
general 2021-12-03 12:51:36 Pop the hood though

general 2021-12-04 21:28:05 The gas prices are decreasing as well
general 2021-12-04 21:28:07 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-04 21:28:13 Very cheap
general 2021-12-04 21:28:24 I don't no
general 2021-12-04 21:28:59 He does love his trains
general 2021-12-04 21:29:16 It's gaijin
general 2021-12-04 21:29:21 I already have their main game
general 2021-12-04 21:31:11 UNTRUE
general 2021-12-04 21:31:13 Very untrue
general 2021-12-04 21:31:22 I liked the new seats
general 2021-12-04 21:32:51 Just look at all the poo on it
general 2021-12-04 21:34:06 And yet still, a car is better
general 2021-12-04 21:34:58 Untrue, you aren't even sure if you get a seat
general 2021-12-04 21:35:52 Wait, you guys got dedicated student trains up there?
general 2021-12-04 21:36:29 Not big enough lol
general 2021-12-04 21:36:44 Greedy NS

general 2021-12-04 21:37:16 
general 2021-12-04 21:37:59 The average one
general 2021-12-04 21:38:30 Count the time it takes for you to get to the station as well though
general 2021-12-04 21:38:39 Not just the train ride
general 2021-12-04 21:38:55 And if it's raining/snowing you will most likely be wet and not on time
general 2021-12-04 21:39:36 I've had rainy days and the train was wheelspinning for a solid 3 minutes before it gripped and took off
general 2021-12-04 21:40:06 What is the black shit
general 2021-12-04 21:40:09 on the sides
general 2021-12-04 21:40:35 Agreed

general 2021-12-04 21:40:56 I like it
general 2021-12-04 21:41:12 MR-2 superiority
general 2021-12-04 21:41:16 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-04 21:42:46 give me the username
general 2021-12-04 21:43:27 He's not in PCC but I will forward it
general 2021-12-04 21:45:19 I like a car more for these reasons: You are in control of it, making it more fun. You are faster at your destination most of the time. You can actually do shit to your car.
general 2021-12-04 21:45:24 Quite yes
general 2021-12-04 21:45:38 Not the extreme south though
general 2021-12-04 21:45:47 Yes
general 2021-12-04 21:45:49 But not like
general 2021-12-04 21:45:52 Southern Limburg
general 2021-12-04 21:46:07 That's where all the weird ones hang out
general 2021-12-04 21:46:56 You basically
general 2021-12-04 21:46:59 put money on it
general 2021-12-04 21:47:16 Scan it at whatever thing you're using for public traffic
general 2021-12-04 21:47:53 I don't live in a city
general 2021-12-04 21:48:00 I don't do Metro's
general 2021-12-04 21:48:44 Next year I can actually fly
general 2021-12-04 21:48:54 With my dad yes
general 2021-12-04 21:49:36 I can probably start flying lessons though
general 2021-12-04 21:49:40 But it's hella expensive
general 2021-12-04 21:50:18 Still waiting for my dad to finish though
general 2021-12-04 21:50:36 A simple flight to Texel would be so good
general 2021-12-04 21:50:49 No we don't
general 2021-12-04 21:50:54 We'll probably rent one
general 2021-12-04 21:51:27 I come there annually, but not in the summer
general 2021-12-04 21:51:43 Very

general 2021-12-04 21:59:55 The coding stuff is just too hard for my idiotic brain to understand
general 2021-12-04 22:00:11 I'm sure once you get into it it'll be easy, but I just don't like it
general 2021-12-04 22:00:12 It's boring
general 2021-12-04 22:00:27 But great choice
general 2021-12-04 22:00:45 Still leaves a lack of people on the technician front
general 2021-12-04 22:01:37 I like making stuff and seeing it work

general 2021-12-06 15:07:55 <@456226577798135808> I will uh
general 2021-12-06 15:07:58 be making battlebot
general 2021-12-06 15:08:24 I made a Mcdonalds bot a few years back
general 2021-12-06 15:08:30 like a 2 minute creation
general 2021-12-06 15:08:39 yes
general 2021-12-06 15:09:53 Yes we do
general 2021-12-06 15:09:58 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-06 15:10:06 We created an entire province
general 2021-12-06 15:12:26 We did battlebot events for over what, 3 years now?
general 2021-12-06 15:13:48 You want to be heavy, fast and have a strong weapon that isn't broken easily
general 2021-12-06 15:14:11 I do as well
general 2021-12-06 17:48:05 Can we like
general 2021-12-06 17:48:12 Gang up on robo for the event
general 2021-12-06 17:48:31 He will win for the 3rd time in a row
general 2021-12-06 17:48:35 If he wins this
general 2021-12-06 17:48:47 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2021-12-06 18:27:26 lo
general 2021-12-06 18:27:26 Su/MiG's even more so
general 2021-12-06 18:28:16 Early Cold era were nice
general 2021-12-06 18:28:37 But the Flanker, MiG-21 etc are all overrated beyond belief
general 2021-12-06 18:28:49 "oeooe funny thrust steering"
general 2021-12-06 18:29:59 I like the F-series jets because:
1. I worked on one of them
2. Some have some really good design like the F-5
general 2021-12-06 18:30:12 Very true
general 2021-12-06 18:31:55 I agree
general 2021-12-06 18:32:40 I have like 6 combustion engined aircraft models next to my monitor
general 2021-12-06 18:35:35 Cringe vectoring
general 2021-12-06 18:37:49 Combustion engined aircraft are just better
general 2021-12-06 18:37:51 Cope
general 2021-12-06 18:38:14 F-16 but it looks shit
general 2021-12-06 18:38:51 It's just an F-16 but with a much shittier wing design
general 2021-12-06 18:39:39 Performance don't mean it look good
general 2021-12-06 18:39:41 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-06 18:40:09 It quite simply looks out of place
general 2021-12-06 18:40:23 The wing should be higher, the front canards should just fuck off
general 2021-12-06 18:40:40 Because it looks stupid
general 2021-12-06 18:40:41 lo
general 2021-12-06 18:41:05 I want it to be looking good in combat
general 2021-12-06 18:41:20 If I saw that ugly thing in the sky I would shoot it down without a second thought
general 2021-12-06 18:41:35 If you want to fling yourself out of the arena, sure
general 2021-12-06 18:42:43 no
general 2021-12-06 18:42:49 It just looks even more ugly now
general 2021-12-06 18:42:53 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2021-12-06 18:44:09 
general 2021-12-06 18:44:21 This is what an F-16 should look like
general 2021-12-06 18:44:38 but it looks good
general 2021-12-06 18:44:58 It looks better than any other F-series jet before it
general 2021-12-06 18:49:34 
general 2021-12-06 18:50:41 Our entire airforce was made up of F-16's for the last what 4 decades?
general 2021-12-06 18:52:58 Battlebots are about chip damage, remember that
general 2021-12-06 18:53:33 Same
general 2021-12-06 18:54:09 no
general 2021-12-06 18:54:23 But it's going to be heavily protected
general 2021-12-06 18:55:24 You can't fly on accident?
general 2021-12-06 18:55:31 You can get flung, but you can't fly
general 2021-12-06 18:56:01 You can't add wings for gliding, it is considered flying
general 2021-12-06 18:56:19 For stability purposes, you might need to ask roborail
general 2021-12-06 18:56:54 Depends, if you can't move the bot when it gets flung you're easy prey
general 2021-12-06 18:57:11 Ask robo for that kind of stuff
general 2021-12-06 18:57:14 I'm not the host
general 2021-12-06 18:57:22 Just a participant of the last few battlebot events
general 2021-12-06 19:05:55 what
general 2021-12-06 19:06:00 I never said no jumping
general 2021-12-06 19:06:08 I only said my bot doesn't jump
general 2021-12-06 19:06:13 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-12-06 19:07:00 I read it wrong then
general 2021-12-06 19:07:01 mb
general 2021-12-06 19:08:00 When will the submissions close by the way
general 2021-12-06 20:40:33 yes
general 2021-12-06 20:40:47 Actually
general 2021-12-06 20:40:49 Yeah
bot-central 2021-12-06 20:41:54 -servers
general 2021-12-06 20:42:16 Yes
general 2021-12-06 20:42:29 You can use half blocks, but no motorlock to compact them
general 2021-12-06 20:42:57 Depends, is it motorlocked?
general 2021-12-06 20:43:01 If it is, then no
general 2021-12-06 20:43:09 If it isn't, I guess? Ask robo
general 2021-12-06 20:43:33 Don't matter if they are connected or not, as long as it's motorlocked you can't use it
general 2021-12-06 20:43:58 hi
general 2021-12-06 20:44:29 RoBlox
general 2021-12-06 20:45:01 Every username I have starts with Tinon and the 2 main initials of the game/platform behind it
general 2021-12-06 20:46:23 Only 2 initials though
general 2021-12-06 20:46:28 Never 3 or more
general 2021-12-06 20:46:37 Anyway
general 2021-12-06 20:46:44 <@456226577798135808> hi what server
general 2021-12-06 20:47:24 a
general 2021-12-07 06:33:27 Event fun
general 2021-12-07 06:38:43 I don't think so
general 2021-12-07 06:38:45 Too op
general 2021-12-07 06:38:50 But ask robo
general 2021-12-07 06:39:23 Some rules can be forgotten
general 2021-12-07 06:39:37 Yes so tnt isn't allowed
general 2021-12-07 06:39:43 Because its a pvp block
general 2021-12-07 07:02:40 Yes
general 2021-12-07 07:04:43 I don't make the rules <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-12-07 07:56:24 The thing is, most people will build these big creations as their battlebot
general 2021-12-07 07:56:44 So you can easily counter them
general 2021-12-07 07:56:54 If you have speed that is
general 2021-12-07 07:57:28 You can make a battlebot alright, but if you don't plan to participate don't post it
general 2021-12-07 07:58:30 Ask robo
general 2021-12-07 07:58:59 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2021-12-07 07:59:29 Ask robo
general 2021-12-07 07:59:30 lo
general 2021-12-07 07:59:42 It's not something major
general 2021-12-07 07:59:58 Probably just a role or something
general 2021-12-07 08:00:37 <#903785921009307648>
general 2021-12-07 08:01:21 yeah no you don't
general 2021-12-07 08:02:06 I did
general 2021-12-07 08:02:09 Rightfully so
general 2021-12-07 08:02:32 No, because it's not allowed
general 2021-12-07 08:02:33 lo
general 2021-12-07 08:02:37 Yes
general 2021-12-07 08:02:42 Clash of Clans channel
general 2021-12-07 08:03:15 Again, ask Robo
general 2021-12-07 08:03:32 The event host?

general 2021-12-07 14:33:22 Grey mesh you don't see often in hoods
general 2021-12-07 14:33:42 Only seen it once or twice
general 2021-12-07 14:35:54 I am biased for bots with no motorlocks
general 2021-12-07 14:35:59 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-12-07 14:36:36 Flipping is a legitimate weapon on battlebots?
general 2021-12-07 14:36:56 Oh I see
general 2021-12-07 14:37:16 Yeah, else you can fly
general 2021-12-07 14:37:25 or instantly stand still
general 2021-12-07 14:37:37 It's basically an anchor block
general 2021-12-07 14:37:57 Everyone should have
general 2021-12-07 14:38:58 No engine blocks
general 2021-12-07 14:39:03 They can be insanely overpowered
general 2021-12-07 14:39:33 You can use it for superb downforce, wall climbing, super speeds etc
general 2021-12-07 14:39:41 It's just too overpowered
general 2021-12-07 14:39:51 It would still be overpowered?
general 2021-12-07 14:40:11 Still
general 2021-12-07 14:40:27 You can make a light bot and use engines for downforce
general 2021-12-07 14:40:36 instant acceleration and braking etc
general 2021-12-07 14:40:53 Not on the list, so you can use it
general 2021-12-07 14:41:20 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2021-12-07 14:41:32 What do you even want to use it for anyway
general 2021-12-07 14:41:45 Yeah, not happening
general 2021-12-07 14:41:57 You fight your opponent, not run away from them
general 2021-12-07 14:42:04 If you plan to run away you shouldn't participate lol
general 2021-12-07 14:43:25 Again, battlebots are meant to fight
general 2021-12-07 14:43:35 If you constantly run from your opponent, then it will be seen as a forfeit
general 2021-12-07 14:44:37 I mean, ask robo
general 2021-12-07 14:44:42 Last time it wasn't
general 2021-12-07 14:45:27 Then you should have pinged a moderator
general 2021-12-07 14:45:53 I did
general 2021-12-07 14:46:02 No no
general 2021-12-07 14:46:07 We aren't starting this again..
general 2021-12-07 14:46:16 If anyone speaks about it you'll be warned
general 2021-12-07 14:46:55 Mate, do you realise that you're the one that brought it up?
general 2021-12-07 14:47:02 And now you want me to fix your problem?
general 2021-12-07 14:47:07 Deal with it in DM's
general 2021-12-07 14:48:24 Just block him for me ty
general 2021-12-07 14:48:49 or if either of you speak about it again i'll mute you for a good hour
general 2021-12-07 14:49:10 By being uh
general 2021-12-07 14:49:12 Not good
general 2021-12-07 14:49:26 Ok good
general 2021-12-07 14:49:53 Darting? Can you elaborate for me, English isn't my first language sorry
general 2021-12-07 14:50:06 Dating oh
general 2021-12-07 14:50:21 Well, not entirely sure
general 2021-12-07 14:50:39 So basically flinging
general 2021-12-07 14:51:05 If you uh, glitch someone out of the arena then no
general 2021-12-07 14:51:16 Well, depends
general 2021-12-07 14:51:30 If you glitch them purposefully then no
general 2021-12-07 14:51:42 If your weapon is a spinning blade thing and they get flung, then yes
general 2021-12-07 14:52:14 You can push them yes, but not like, glitch them or something
general 2021-12-07 14:52:47 Pistons not allowed
general 2021-12-07 14:53:35 Pistons cause massive lag
general 2021-12-07 14:54:53 They didn't no
general 2021-12-07 14:54:58 THAT GAVE ME
general 2021-12-07 14:55:01 a brilliant idea
general 2021-12-07 14:55:03 Alright
general 2021-12-07 14:56:07 Ask robo if you can use wing panels
general 2021-12-07 14:56:17 As far as I know he forgot to add them to the list
general 2021-12-07 14:57:29 If it's heavy, maybe
general 2021-12-07 14:58:12 yep
general 2021-12-07 14:58:17 projectiles are allowed
general 2021-12-07 14:58:23 just not a pvp one
general 2021-12-07 15:01:57 Which one
general 2021-12-07 15:02:37 I read Honda for a second and I was like what
general 2021-12-07 15:02:54 Ah I see
general 2021-12-07 15:03:11 So basically a 1997 Opel Corsa
general 2021-12-07 15:05:35 That reminds me of a good time actually
general 2021-12-07 15:06:06 We used to have this project back in school where we had to make remote controlled lawn mowers
general 2021-12-07 15:06:18 We turned them into deformed battlebots
general 2021-12-07 15:07:01 I don't know, it's your life not mine lol
general 2021-12-07 15:07:36 I don't watch aussie youtubers
general 2021-12-07 15:07:49 Because I know none
general 2021-12-07 15:09:03 You do know that we can easily sweep the legs
general 2021-12-07 15:10:08 It's a pvp block so yes

general 2021-12-12 11:52:02 The shitstar
general 2021-12-12 12:11:14 Plane can't drift
general 2021-12-12 12:11:21 No wheels are powered on a plane
general 2021-12-12 12:12:06 That is just called airflow
general 2021-12-12 12:12:18 A plane cannot drift 😭
general 2021-12-12 12:12:48 It physically cannot. You need powered wheels
general 2021-12-12 12:13:10 Then it isn't drifting
general 2021-12-12 12:13:29 There is no such thing as oversteer on a plane
general 2021-12-12 12:13:33 💀
general 2021-12-12 12:14:02 It can fly sideways and crash*
general 2021-12-12 12:14:05 Cope

general 2021-12-12 12:15:35 No tyres = no drift

general 2021-12-12 12:31:27 Tbh it can sometimes be annoying
general 2021-12-12 12:31:46 But most of the time it's just minor stuff you deal with

general 2021-12-15 13:59:12 Unless its a city
general 2021-12-15 13:59:46 Yeah rent is relatively cheap
general 2021-12-15 14:00:06 Lets gooo
general 2021-12-15 14:00:11 People moving here
general 2021-12-15 14:01:02 Tech nerds of any kind will get work here
general 2021-12-15 14:01:48 If you find the right spot, its extremely cheap
general 2021-12-15 14:02:00 Alwayd
general 2021-12-15 14:02:59 My family and I live in this relatively big house and it costs us mainly a monthly pay to the bank
general 2021-12-15 14:03:09 Don't know the english word for it
general 2021-12-15 14:03:35 Tax is pretty high
general 2021-12-15 14:03:48 But the rest is relatively low
general 2021-12-15 14:04:00 Don't have any plans to move out
general 2021-12-15 14:05:08 I mean, its a giant city
general 2021-12-15 14:05:51 Yep
general 2021-12-15 14:06:08 And in Eindhoven
general 2021-12-15 14:06:17 Damn thats pretty cheap
general 2021-12-15 14:07:02 LOOO
general 2021-12-15 14:07:15 Yeah you are paying WAY less for that here
general 2021-12-15 14:14:34 A trade?
general 2021-12-15 14:15:26 Job thing?
general 2021-12-15 14:15:30 Just searched it up
general 2021-12-15 14:15:44 Yeah okay I see
general 2021-12-15 14:16:07 We call that an 'Opleiding' here and it is something you do after highschool
general 2021-12-15 14:16:21 You basically choose a route you want to be in for jobs etc
general 2021-12-15 14:16:49 Then you can choose which 'opleiding' you want to follow (such as mechanic)
general 2021-12-15 14:16:54 And it can be very expensive
general 2021-12-15 14:17:16 It's basically a universal trade
general 2021-12-15 14:17:34 There are many schools that teach you that
general 2021-12-15 14:19:48 Yeah it's basically the same here
general 2021-12-15 14:20:01 But it can get very expensive
general 2021-12-15 14:26:48 Excellent plan ngl
general 2021-12-15 14:26:51 Living it cheap
general 2021-12-15 14:27:52 Well, since electrification will be almost certain at 2035
general 2021-12-15 14:27:56 I don't think so
general 2021-12-15 14:28:20 But you can always apply for the military since they are in dire need for it
general 2021-12-15 14:28:35 All cars sold in the EU will need to be electric
general 2021-12-15 14:28:55 The combustion engine will not be admitted for sale anymore
general 2021-12-15 14:29:34 And then you got them mfs over in china where they re-open like 10 more coal powerplants
general 2021-12-15 14:29:38 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2021-12-15 14:30:20 Very true
general 2021-12-15 14:31:24 near 2035 is when most people will be immigrating to other countries outside of the EU
general 2021-12-15 14:31:48 Not only that
general 2021-12-15 14:32:07 Mechanics, people that don't believe in electrification etc
general 2021-12-15 14:32:46 I don't mind it, but for the sake of classic cars etc it's bad
general 2021-12-15 14:33:06 Ask Jeremy. I bet you he'll be fine.
general 2021-12-15 14:33:13 The UK is out of the EU remember that
general 2021-12-15 14:33:26 Yes

general 2021-12-15 14:33:43 Jep
general 2021-12-15 14:34:43 Volvo, Audi, Opel etc they are all working to get into electrification
general 2021-12-15 14:34:50 But brands from Italy are like

general 2021-12-15 22:35:58 <:empty:794431705070174238>

the-dump 2021-12-16 13:38:17 I see a GR badge
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:38:19 Is this real
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:40:38 Is it the official one
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:40:48 Why am I even asking this pls evidence :(
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:40:52 Link me to it
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:13 Not what I was expecting it to be, but it looks cool
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:22 Might be because I am biased
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:34 I like it
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:43:46 Isn't it a hybrid?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:04 AWD
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:10 god damn
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:13 Oh well
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:23 I mean, eventually every car will have an EV variant
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:44:56 It kinda rocks ngl
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:45:06 I really like this new Lexus concept render
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:45:58 Yeah I heard. They have a sedan variant as well no?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:46:18 Shows they've been working hard though
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:47:07 The SUV (and crossover?) don't work for me
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:47:16 But the sedan and coupe really do
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:49:43 Toyota will probably get a lot of hate for releasing an EV lineup but I don't care at all lol
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:49:51 If the cars look like that I want to buy one
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:50:18 Now let's see if they market it as well as their GR Supra commercial
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:52:28 Wow yes uh unfunny rating try again
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:52:43 As it should
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:52:58 It's the one thing I look forward to the most
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:53:27 Just driving about, roof down and enjoying the wind in the Dutch summer "heat"
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:55:28 I thought this was a Mazda because of the bodywork
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:55:33 CX-3 I believe?
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:58:06 I want to get that new MR-2 as fast as possible LO
the-dump 2021-12-16 13:59:41 I just got an MR-S but I want one as soon as possible
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:00:09 the AW11 and SW20 will most likely be old timers by then but eventually I want to own all 4
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:00:58 But what do you think of the new lineup though
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:01:04 Since your opinion is also welcome to me
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:01:41 nono
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:01:46 2 Mclarens at most
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:01:49 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:02:40 Probably an F1 and a 720s
the-dump 2021-12-16 14:03:11 P1 is cool, good looking

general 2022-01-07 12:54:10 Agreed
general 2022-01-07 12:55:34 This new Imp is a WRX
general 2022-01-07 12:55:44 They stuck with the name even though they ended their rally reign
general 2022-01-07 12:56:06 
general 2022-01-07 12:56:53 Say what you want, but the retro cars are not coming back anymore lol

general 2022-01-07 13:03:14 If you want to tryhard it, perish
general 2022-01-07 13:04:00 Playing Germany is already a pain in and of it self
general 2022-01-07 13:04:17 How are German planes bad bruh
general 2022-01-07 13:04:21 Ever played Italy
general 2022-01-07 13:04:24 💀
general 2022-01-07 13:04:36 What kind of planes have you been flying my guy
general 2022-01-07 13:04:57 Then you are just shit at flying them ngl
general 2022-01-07 13:05:01 They turn fantastic
general 2022-01-07 13:05:22 You should not try American planes if you already complain with German ones
general 2022-01-07 13:05:45 It can lol
general 2022-01-07 13:05:51 It turns better than a mustang
general 2022-01-07 13:06:15 Its turn radius is the average American one
general 2022-01-07 13:06:34 You are used to the spitfire aren't you
general 2022-01-07 13:06:42 hi
general 2022-01-07 13:07:05 I haven't because it's filled with dirty drivers
general 2022-01-07 13:07:45 I am not buying a racing sim for singleplayer
general 2022-01-07 13:07:52 Let alone Gran Turismo
general 2022-01-07 13:08:17 (I don't have a console)
general 2022-01-07 13:08:26 What's TC2
general 2022-01-07 13:08:55 I already have Forza 4
general 2022-01-07 13:09:02 I don't need another open world game
general 2022-01-07 13:09:39 DiRT is a rally game though
general 2022-01-07 13:10:32 I need a starting grid, no dirty racers, easy custom mod implementation and it don't need to be owned by Microsoft
general 2022-01-07 13:11:00 Racing room is a pay to play game
general 2022-01-07 13:11:39 Is it on steam
general 2022-01-07 13:11:45 hi
general 2022-01-07 13:12:06 Let's see, is it cheaper than 30 euro's
general 2022-01-07 13:15:47 Only 8 maps to play on
general 2022-01-07 13:16:08 There is no perfect race sim
general 2022-01-07 13:16:38 I haven't been to a track just yet but I might
general 2022-01-07 13:17:23 Assetto corsa is good, but you it takes like 500 hours to set up a room to play in
general 2022-01-07 13:17:56 (rally game, not a track based one)
general 2022-01-07 13:18:37 NFS is just unrealistic
general 2022-01-07 13:19:05 Forza 7 is filled with 12 year old lamborghini fan crybabies
general 2022-01-07 13:19:47 If Forza wasn't made by Microsoft, I would've been on board
general 2022-01-07 13:20:01 Because microsofts servers are downright shit
general 2022-01-07 13:21:18 The only good racing game that I play at the moment is on a server on FiveM (GTAV add-on)
general 2022-01-07 13:22:31 You can make your own tracks and cars, Dirty driving means a ban, no connection issues, superb moderation and it's very flexible
general 2022-01-07 13:22:53 Most racing sims are
general 2022-01-07 13:23:00 Because actual clowns are behind the screen
general 2022-01-07 13:24:38 This shit looks horrible
general 2022-01-07 13:25:30 It's got a NOS button
general 2022-01-07 13:25:35 How is that
general 2022-01-07 13:25:43 That isn't a racing game
general 2022-01-07 13:25:47 That's mario kart
general 2022-01-07 13:25:50 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-01-07 13:26:34 A racing sim isn't supposed to have an arcade gameplay tint to it
general 2022-01-07 13:26:52 Then I don't want it
general 2022-01-07 13:26:57 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2022-01-07 13:50:43 Find a server
general 2022-01-07 13:51:03 (If you want a racing server I do highly suggest Project Homecoming)

general 2022-01-07 14:22:49 Stage 4 is pretty decent
general 2022-01-07 14:22:53 Worth watching imo

general 2022-01-12 11:48:34 First, become level 3 for image perms in other channels
general 2022-01-12 11:48:47 If you want image perms for this channel you will need an expert rank
general 2022-01-12 11:49:42 This is <#497142796961054721>. Because blatant idiots shitpost in here all the time it is restricted to Expert ranks only
general 2022-01-12 11:50:38 No, but we did update the server rules
general 2022-01-12 11:52:09 No the average Expert rank has at least 1 more braincell than the rest of yous
general 2022-01-12 11:52:11 Thats why
general 2022-01-12 11:54:21 Image perms shouldn't be easy to get anyways
general 2022-01-12 11:54:47 Else people will still be easily able to shitpost in here and that don't solve the issue
general 2022-01-12 11:55:21 No because nothing you send is funny <:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-01-14 12:19:30 Question; how fast do ya'll ships go?
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:20:54 It will most likely be streamed on the PCC twitch account
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:09 But we do not allow spectators in the game server
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:24 Because all server spots are reserved for the participants
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:21:36 Basic knowledge though
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:03 We will pick another backup participant in that instance
events-chat 2022-01-14 12:22:18 That's up to the event host

general 2022-01-15 13:01:12 How much money did you waste on those
general 2022-01-15 13:01:41 (I can buy almost the exact same design for like 20 bucks)
general 2022-01-15 13:02:20 They do nothing more than the usual shoe lol
general 2022-01-15 13:02:34 Same with mine
general 2022-01-15 13:03:11 I don't want 0.00002% more trampoline in my shoe and pay 1 billion dollars extra for it lol
general 2022-01-15 13:03:52 It's the same with those airmax shoes or whatever
general 2022-01-15 13:04:07 One sharp rock and that is like 60 dollars gone
general 2022-01-15 13:04:09 lol
general 2022-01-15 13:04:55 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-01-15 13:05:17 Those are airmax though lol
general 2022-01-15 13:06:41 My point still stands, why would you spend so much money on just regular old shoes
general 2022-01-15 13:07:11 Jordans or whatever they're called are just plain ugly compared to most shoes lol

general 2022-01-15 13:14:10 But honestly, can anyone give me their reason they buy expensive shoes (60 euro's+)
general 2022-01-15 13:14:28 When similar designs are there for way less money
general 2022-01-15 13:14:44 Is it social status or what
general 2022-01-15 13:15:29 So if you buy those shoes, do you like automatically get 10 friends or whatever
general 2022-01-15 13:16:23 So basically what you all are saying is that you hang out with people that make the same stupid financial decisions as you
general 2022-01-15 13:16:30 <:stuff:908917207986208828>

general 2022-01-15 23:03:14 Even some Xbox support dude accessed my PC and they couldn't find the issue either
general 2022-01-15 23:03:52 At this point I have just completely given up on playing either of the games solely because microsoft can't manage shit

general 2022-01-15 23:16:32 The top of your boat needs to be thrusted into the direction you want to go
general 2022-01-15 23:18:10 
general 2022-01-15 23:18:12 Do this
general 2022-01-15 23:18:26 Add more thrust in the top part if your boat still does the flicky thing
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:20:55 This sounds so much better than my 1.8 I4 lol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:21:21 But then again it's literally like 15 years older
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:21:52 I have already showered and I am not going back outside now lo
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:21:57 Maybe some other time
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:22:27 Almost sounds like a Porsche
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:23:52 I have found a video with so much better sound quality
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:24:06 Aight you know what
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:24:09 https://youtu.be/efyDwTL26z8
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:24:09 Picture this sound
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:24:19 yes I am
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:24:20 phone
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:09 
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:12 There
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:15 I bought it like this
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:25:40 I am really not a BMW guy
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:26:01 I like the look of the newest Z4 and the Z3 but I have never actively heard one rev before
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:26:12 Since most of the people that drive them are like 60 years old
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:27:20 I rev mine at like 6k max
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:27:55 Petrol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:28:26 I have massive oil problems with the 1zz I run currently
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:28:42 It's a 2001 model and it is **very** thirsty
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:29:16 It's with every 1zz engine from 1998 to 2002
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:29:40 They fixed the problems in 2003 but the prices for those cars are like 1k extra
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:01 True, but it's still 1k
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:15 And i'd rather spend a bit more on oil than that
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:30:35 Depends on what though lol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:01 5 gears
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:07 Stick only
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:35 Lol no
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:54 Better torque distrobution I guess
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:31:59 But this car really don't need it
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:14 It only tops at about 210 km/h
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:28 And it's known for how stable it is (not counting the snap oversteer)
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:32:57 But a BMW is even thirstier and way more expensive to maintain unfortunately
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:33:47 How much did you pay for it (if you want to share that info)
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:05 Damn quite expensive
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:33 Jeebus
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:43 I run like 7.2L/100km
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:34:44 lol
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:07 If only I could afford that at the moment
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:22 On regular trips I pay like 4 euro's
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:24 I do yes
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:35:58 As for normal commuter cars i'd say Lexus is a favourite of mine
the-dump 2022-01-15 23:36:09 If you count exotic, definitely Mclaren

general 2022-01-18 08:07:28 I am terrified
general 2022-01-18 08:07:44 The wheel (I hope)
general 2022-01-18 08:07:54 Hold on let me check the wheel arcs
general 2022-01-18 08:08:36 Nothing wrong with it
general 2022-01-18 08:08:54 WHAT DID HE DO
general 2022-01-18 08:10:01 Rims are fine as well
general 2022-01-18 08:10:35 Why would I check the trunk if it's the front that hit the rock
general 2022-01-18 08:10:41 lo
general 2022-01-18 08:11:31 There is an engine in the trunk
general 2022-01-18 08:12:22 >Headlight sticks snapped when my dad drove my car
>He said he hit a rock but I can't find any damage on the car
>Very confused
general 2022-01-18 08:12:36 He didn't tell me how big
general 2022-01-18 08:12:57 It's only the sticks keeping my headlight in place that snapped
general 2022-01-18 08:13:06 Not calling insurance for that lo
general 2022-01-18 08:13:42 There is none
general 2022-01-18 08:13:57 Because it's my car

general 2022-01-18 08:25:42 And he thinks he hit one because of the loud crack he heard
general 2022-01-18 08:25:50 Probably the rod that snapped is what he heard
general 2022-01-18 08:26:42 If he hit a curb he would have felt it

general 2022-01-18 11:24:54 Okay so I used to own only one guineapig, but when we got back from vacation he mated with one of the other staying guinea pigs and we got one of the 3 back home, so a father and son
general 2022-01-18 11:25:48 The father eventually had a big growth on the back of his butt that eventually got bitten open by the son and he eventually died, and not long after, the son died because he was devastated by his father dying

general 2022-01-20 10:18:54 I think they used the RX Vision concept for the design of the MX-5 again
general 2022-01-20 10:19:12 And they used the platform for Toyota's new GT3 concept
general 2022-01-20 10:19:36 Possibly

general 2022-01-25 09:17:16 I live about a 30 minute drive away from the outskirts of a city and it is really cheap here
general 2022-01-25 09:20:02 American houses are all cheap because they are made out of cardboard
general 2022-01-25 09:20:40 Tornadoes, weather, maybe a car rams it?
general 2022-01-25 09:21:14 Probably everywhere tornadoes are frequent
general 2022-01-25 09:21:27 We don't have houses here where the entire roof flies off because a breeze hit it

general 2022-01-25 20:26:59 I'm going to hopefully fix some of the oil problems
general 2022-01-25 20:27:35 I need to replace the outdated silversprings on the pistonheads
general 2022-01-25 20:32:18 Reveal as you wish, just know that it's probably not a smart idea
general 2022-01-25 20:32:40 Because whatever happens, us mods aren't responsible for anything that happens to it
general 2022-01-25 20:33:12 Take Comedi as an example, he revealed his face, made a mess, and now his mess is here
general 2022-01-25 20:33:22 I am not going to clean up yours as well
general 2022-01-25 20:33:26 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-01-25 20:34:04 That made zero sense to me
general 2022-01-25 20:35:39 I am unsure of what to do with me car
general 2022-01-25 20:35:52 No
general 2022-01-25 20:36:16 I've got oil problems with the engine since it's burning through it like crazy
general 2022-01-25 20:37:00 I know what the problem is, but I don't know whether I should fix it myself (taking apart the whole block) or pay a mechanic to do it for 3k euro's
general 2022-01-25 20:37:31 No, the cylinder silversprings are not the correct size and oil leaks into the cylinders
general 2022-01-25 20:37:40 It burns about 1 litre per 600km
general 2022-01-25 20:37:41 lo
general 2022-01-25 20:37:59 a cloud of smoke pours out of the exhaust every time I step on it lol

general 2022-01-25 20:42:29 That's where it's leaking
general 2022-01-25 20:42:56 No, it's going up
general 2022-01-25 20:43:42 Oil heats up, expands, goes into the cylinder and gets evaporated by the heat of the ignition of the piston
general 2022-01-25 20:44:01 biggus problus
general 2022-01-25 20:44:37 Yes but that costs so damn much
general 2022-01-25 20:44:54 Taking apart an entire engine block is very expensive
general 2022-01-25 20:44:59 yes
general 2022-01-25 20:45:01 euro's
general 2022-01-25 20:46:13 You know what i'll ask if I can use my friends garage for a while

general 2022-01-25 20:48:21 WHY
general 2022-01-25 20:48:48 Why is an entire new block cheaper than the repair?!!!
general 2022-01-25 20:49:21 I can do that myself
general 2022-01-25 20:51:17 Wrong engine model man
general 2022-01-25 20:52:05 I have rebuilt engines before

general 2022-01-25 21:24:57 I just chomp those down with 2 bites each
general 2022-01-25 21:25:00 No need to cut it
general 2022-01-25 21:25:21 I just use a fork
general 2022-01-25 21:25:27 No need for a knife
general 2022-01-25 21:26:05 Just pull it apart with a fork
general 2022-01-25 21:26:10 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-01-25 21:26:45 Most days we don't use a knife here

general 2022-01-25 22:53:07 Probably
general 2022-01-25 22:53:25 It's better then sitting here, living a normal life

general 2022-01-25 23:02:24 Eurofighters, Dassaults, F-5's, F-16's and F-35's will form a front line offensive against Russian jets

plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:27:37 part I was pointing out
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:27:54 The frame already took me longer than needed
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:27:59 so not changing that
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:16 I extended it by 2 blocks because else it's too short
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:27 And 1 block is impossible
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:33 It's just the fucking rod
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:48 this
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:53 This is all I need your opinion on
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:29:57 🗿

plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:35:11 Wanted to make a simple Dutch plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:35:46 Yeah but 1 block shorter and it looks too stubby
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:36:03 2 blocks and it looks like it is missing 3 cylinders of it's engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:36:07 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:36:54 I am not motorlocking a prop lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:36:59 I refuse to do any more locking
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:37:21 No because then it looks too short lo
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:37:43 And I don't plan to do much effort for it anyway
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:37:44 lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:38:05 When I finish the rear wings sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 19:42:51 Why do people
general 2022-01-31 20:19:23 First plane in about 2 years and this took way longer than needed...
general 2022-01-31 20:20:39 Fokker D.XXIII
events-chat 2022-01-31 21:31:01 Yeah but shooting down bombers can be fun
events-chat 2022-01-31 21:31:18 Since those aren't going to be manoeuvring very quick
general 2022-01-31 22:13:48 Right
general 2022-01-31 22:13:56 Man do I hate BMW SUV's
general 2022-01-31 22:16:05 Good choice
general 2022-01-31 22:19:42 What did he replace
general 2022-01-31 22:19:55 Because the horsepower doesn't increase by shedding weight lo
general 2022-01-31 22:20:07 and 200 horsepower is a big amount
general 2022-01-31 22:20:10 Even for a BMW engine
general 2022-01-31 22:20:25 What did he do to the engine to add 200 extra horses lol
general 2022-01-31 22:20:27 Goddamn
general 2022-01-31 22:21:58 So you changed the header and the engine makes 200 extra horses?
general 2022-01-31 22:22:07 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-01-31 22:22:22 Could be my mic buffering lol
general 2022-01-31 22:22:34 I have never barked in a VC, let alone PCC lol
general 2022-01-31 22:22:48 sorry to disappoint you, but that is impossible lol
general 2022-01-31 22:23:05 Are you sure it was me?
general 2022-01-31 22:23:50 Sounds like someone is trying to make me their personal furry or some shit wtf
general 2022-01-31 22:24:15 Then they must have added at least something else
general 2022-01-31 22:24:28 Because a simple header change car add about 10 horses max lol
general 2022-01-31 22:24:59 You're the one that fucking lied lol
general 2022-01-31 22:25:33 Last time I spoke in here was in members VC lol
general 2022-01-31 22:25:59 How long ago then lo
general 2022-01-31 22:26:32 I wasn't here then
general 2022-01-31 22:26:33 lo
general 2022-01-31 22:27:07 Same tbh
general 2022-01-31 22:27:13 Not a fan of German cars in general
general 2022-01-31 22:28:01 Unless you drive a new M3, M4 or Mercedes AMG, I don't care what you drive
general 2022-01-31 22:28:13 Because everything else I see daily
general 2022-01-31 22:28:23 The Supra is Japanese mate
general 2022-01-31 22:28:24 lo
general 2022-01-31 22:28:31 And no, the new one is Japanese as well
general 2022-01-31 22:28:53 I am yes. Simple, reliable, small and most of all, cheap
general 2022-01-31 22:29:08 They only share the same platform lo
general 2022-01-31 22:29:26 Scam most likely
general 2022-01-31 22:29:57 Was it a Mk3
general 2022-01-31 22:30:06 Then I understand why
general 2022-01-31 22:30:19 Most unreliable of them all lol
general 2022-01-31 22:33:17 When speaking about a Japanese car fan, I don't mean that I am a JDM fanboy. Cars sold in Europe are what i'm after. JDM "Legends" are also on my dislike list, mainly the GT-R's (except the first 3 designs topping at the R31), Supra's, Evo's, you know the rest :/
general 2022-01-31 22:33:48 Car companies cannot sell any more gasoline powered cars in 2035 here in Europe
general 2022-01-31 22:34:09 Is this your first, second or third?
general 2022-01-31 22:34:38 You will drive one as well eventually
general 2022-01-31 22:34:50 Aight hold on
general 2022-01-31 22:34:59 Yeah embrace it
general 2022-01-31 22:35:04 Most designs look good though
general 2022-01-31 22:35:58 Gas will become incredibly expensive
general 2022-01-31 22:36:12 And to be totally honest, my first electric car will be this
general 2022-01-31 22:38:05 Teleporting is impossible to do lol
general 2022-01-31 22:38:16 The amount of energy needed to open a wormhole is like
general 2022-01-31 22:39:27 Lexus' new electric coupe
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 07:37:33 hi
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 07:38:47 Did you leave and rejoin?
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 07:39:19 Yeah with the new system in place that happens. Without a screenshot of your roles I cannot give them back unfortunately
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 07:40:21 Sorry, but else people can rig the system and get free roles

general 2022-02-01 11:39:49 Plus, you work with a team
general 2022-02-01 11:40:22 Yeah but there is no way you are going to earn 30k a month with your profession

general 2022-02-02 10:51:15 To the one who posted that script, you're lucky.
general 2022-02-02 10:51:46 No, the image of an in-game script

general 2022-02-02 10:53:04 Insta ban lo
general 2022-02-02 11:11:46 No. It's not allowed to use a script in Plane Crazy
general 2022-02-02 11:12:27 Sending scripts of private games is something you should do in DM, but scripting in Plane Crazy is a bannable offense
general 2022-02-02 12:44:55 Plot twist: Jet and tank engines are louder

general 2022-02-02 14:42:22 (drivers)
general 2022-02-02 14:42:50 Thought yous gonna say Scooter
general 2022-02-02 14:43:51 You can filter out people that don't make good financial decisions based on what they drive
general 2022-02-02 14:45:36 People that drive these are shit at making decisions with money
creations-chat 2022-02-02 14:46:50 I mean I can't ban it

general 2022-02-02 14:47:44 Unless you live in Asia, this is a big waste of money
general 2022-02-02 14:48:14 The distances you travel with those can easily be crossed using a bicycle
general 2022-02-02 14:48:28 Save up for a car to travel those distances

plane-crazy 2022-02-03 18:49:46 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 18:51:31 Is it a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 18:52:10 Strange i'll look into it
general 2022-02-04 00:58:48 Few things I noticed about the car: the radio volume button is broken, the brakes are a bit weak so they need replacement and the gearknob needs changing

events-chat 2022-02-04 11:33:43 300 is the maximum. The only way you can go over that limit is when diving
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:34:04 If you cannot evade shots because you don't have enough speed, you don't have a good aircraft
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:34:08 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:35:10 So long it doesn't contribute to the maximum level flight speed it's fine
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:35:20 (but cringe nontheless)
events-chat 2022-02-04 11:37:39 I mean, yeah but the objective of winning this event for your team is by shooting down the bombers

general 2022-02-05 11:52:15 He was eating our exotic plants
general 2022-02-05 11:52:27 So he decided to make himself comfortable
general 2022-02-05 11:54:32 
general 2022-02-05 15:49:42 "Bruh you are not allowed to say ... now?"
general 2022-02-05 15:49:49 🗿
general 2022-02-05 17:19:11 Tip: Never, and I repeat, never lend your money to anybody
general 2022-02-05 17:19:18 hi
general 2022-02-05 17:19:40 How did they even steal it
general 2022-02-05 17:20:00 Or a better question; why do you have 500 of whatever currency you use in cash
general 2022-02-05 17:22:25 Man am I happy that I don't have many extroverted friends
general 2022-02-05 17:23:45 depends, I don't see friends like others do apparently
general 2022-02-05 17:24:48 I consider like 4 of my friends as friends
general 2022-02-05 17:25:20 A small group is legit better than some giant "friendgroup"
general 2022-02-05 17:25:54 No, because at least 5 of those are going to spark some drama nobody asked for
general 2022-02-05 17:27:20 Nobody can have a 30 people friendgroup and call everyone their friends lo
general 2022-02-05 17:28:37 To me friends are people you can decide to go to a fastfood chain at like 22:45 with by just messaging them, and have so much fun afterwards
general 2022-02-05 17:29:09 Because it is
general 2022-02-05 17:31:15 What day should I make a cake
general 2022-02-05 17:31:34 No i'll be working
general 2022-02-05 17:31:42 Working like 7 days this week
general 2022-02-05 17:31:49 💀
general 2022-02-05 17:31:59 Yeah
general 2022-02-05 17:32:16 Most likely the 20th
general 2022-02-05 17:32:30 Brain power moment
general 2022-02-05 17:32:52 wow fredbear! We sure don't want to know!
general 2022-02-05 17:45:47 Look at this cool bomber
general 2022-02-05 17:47:00 Look at this cool hydroplane torpedo bomber
general 2022-02-05 17:47:13 It's Dutch, therefor it is automatically cool
general 2022-02-05 17:47:25 I am already making it
general 2022-02-05 18:08:50 Don't
general 2022-02-05 18:08:57 From my experience, it's pretty bad
general 2022-02-05 18:09:07 At 4.7 you will get uptiered so hard
general 2022-02-05 18:09:41 I suggest unlocking the Jumbo (M4A3E2) first
general 2022-02-05 18:44:44 >Can't say racial slurs
>Shits on mods because of it
general 2022-02-05 18:44:57 Average PCC behavior (beta males)
general 2022-02-05 18:45:23 Sigma male behaviour right there
general 2022-02-05 18:48:03 hi
general 2022-02-05 18:49:13 Welcome friend, to light tank gameplay
general 2022-02-05 18:49:25 My kind of playstyle revolves around moving about
general 2022-02-05 18:49:39 Heavy tanks are for front line warfare
general 2022-02-05 18:50:31 That's why I like playing light tanks
general 2022-02-05 18:51:18 You can just zip about the battlefield, going from cover from cover and killing everything in sight
general 2022-02-05 18:51:36 Only downside is when the entire team is pushing you, or you get flanked
general 2022-02-05 18:52:48 I mean, I mainly play the US because it's got a lot of diversity
general 2022-02-05 18:53:19 And I only play German tanks if I want to restrict myself from punching my screen because it takes so long to get anywhere
general 2022-02-05 18:54:14 Ok fine i'll start up wt
general 2022-02-05 18:54:51 Wait wdym?
general 2022-02-05 18:55:10 I got 2 event vehicles, and they are all from Germany
general 2022-02-05 18:55:20 20mm bullshit puma which is a tonne of fun to play
general 2022-02-05 18:55:35 Those are all light tanks in the above thing though
general 2022-02-05 18:57:57 Goddamn is there a shortcut keybind for snipping tool or no
general 2022-02-05 18:58:37 it no work
general 2022-02-05 18:58:39 :(
general 2022-02-05 18:59:23 
general 2022-02-05 18:59:46 Yeah it's pretty good
general 2022-02-05 19:00:06 My favourite thing to play is AA
general 2022-02-05 19:00:42 Oh I am always shooting down aircraft with them
general 2022-02-05 19:00:57 I am like shocked at how good i've gotten at shooting down planes
general 2022-02-05 19:01:23 And American AA is difficult to play due to bad ballistics
general 2022-02-05 19:01:38 Yeah R3's are annoying
general 2022-02-05 19:01:51 Once you get to 6.7 they are all gone
general 2022-02-05 19:02:22 Many people do
general 2022-02-05 19:02:55 Me in russia (very fun at 3.7)
general 2022-02-05 19:03:29 Russia can be fun, but it's difficult to play when uptiered
general 2022-02-05 19:04:01 I can cope with depression angles and stabilisers
general 2022-02-05 19:04:20 I can't cope with their armour configuration
general 2022-02-05 19:04:36 IS-1/2 armour
general 2022-02-05 19:04:39 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-02-05 19:04:56 Yeah I don't play heavies anyway
general 2022-02-05 19:05:34 Only exception being the Jumbo and KV-2
general 2022-02-05 19:05:42 Because they are just fun to play
general 2022-02-05 19:06:39 Always move in cover
general 2022-02-05 19:07:29 💪
general 2022-02-05 19:07:46 Light tank earnings
general 2022-02-05 19:07:53 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-02-05 19:08:07 Severely underweight gang!
general 2022-02-05 19:08:48 Play low tier as much as possible
general 2022-02-05 19:08:58 I did and I didn't get any trouble with SL ever
general 2022-02-05 19:09:42 They usually spawn after their first death, so like mid-match
general 2022-02-05 19:09:58 Yeah no planes
general 2022-02-05 19:09:59 lo
general 2022-02-05 19:10:34 Average light tank earnings
general 2022-02-05 19:10:36 Per match
general 2022-02-05 19:10:41 💪 💪
general 2022-02-05 19:20:10 I used to have a fear of those as well, until I just like
general 2022-02-05 19:20:11 didn't
general 2022-02-05 19:22:47 It's sometimes very funny to see people rage whenever you shoot them down with an AA
general 2022-02-05 19:23:48 Fun story: one time this nurse just like squeezed my arm real hard when she put the needle in
general 2022-02-05 19:24:04 I flexed my arm and that shit HURT
general 2022-02-05 19:51:30 Yeah
general 2022-02-05 20:23:21 
general 2022-02-05 21:02:42 Why are you on the bus that late
general 2022-02-05 21:02:48 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-02-05 21:04:14 I mean, if it looks like it can fly yeah
general 2022-02-05 21:20:28 Fokker T.9 bomber. Made to replace the Martin B-10 and a direct response to the Japanese threat looming in the pacific.
general 2022-02-05 21:20:42 I've probably been drunk in here as well
general 2022-02-05 21:21:00 I don't know mate, I would have been drunk
general 2022-02-05 21:21:10 Lil high my guy?
general 2022-02-05 21:21:33 Lay on your bed and think about stuff
general 2022-02-05 21:22:14 He's a bit uh
general 2022-02-05 21:22:36 He is high in a way I have never seen before
general 2022-02-05 21:23:04 ah okay that explains it
general 2022-02-05 21:23:22 Lay off the phone for a while and try to get some sleep :)
general 2022-02-05 21:23:46 You told us that about an hour ago
general 2022-02-05 21:24:13 No worries inventer, I suggest you try and take some sleep
general 2022-02-05 21:24:19 Sleep is very good for you
general 2022-02-05 21:25:17 Still, you should try to get some
general 2022-02-05 21:26:01 It is fun, but defo not healthy
general 2022-02-05 21:26:15 I have had my fair share of
general 2022-02-05 21:26:27 Aria math
general 2022-02-05 21:26:40 I become very stubborn
general 2022-02-05 21:26:57 But people always manage to make me stop doing whatever I want to do
general 2022-02-05 21:27:18 No that's not how being drunk works lo
general 2022-02-05 21:28:53 The only way to get any alcohol out of your system is by waiting
general 2022-02-05 21:29:09 If you want to prevent alcohol from entering your body, empty your stomach
general 2022-02-05 21:29:30 He's drunk fresh, that won't work lol
general 2022-02-05 21:29:55 Just so everyone knows: can we not toy around with inventer please
general 2022-02-05 21:30:31 No, we are not going to toy around with you while you are drunk
general 2022-02-05 21:30:53 Inventer is a person, Inventor is a rank
general 2022-02-05 21:31:10 Same with you mate :)
general 2022-02-05 21:31:27 I've trained myself for this
general 2022-02-05 21:32:12 The role means you have invented something new that is of use to pretty much everyone playing this game such as motorlocking, but since everything has already been discovered it has been made unobtainable
general 2022-02-05 21:33:41 Pretty much everything has been discovered
general 2022-02-05 21:33:52 
general 2022-02-05 21:33:55 WHAT
general 2022-02-05 21:35:26 No use, it won't work
general 2022-02-05 21:35:47 Hey inventer, want a cool song to listen to?
general 2022-02-05 21:36:07 https://youtu.be/SYxrsTYngRs
general 2022-02-05 21:39:52 Yeah I know

general 2022-02-05 21:54:18 apart from like Pokémon, this is the only anime series i've watched
general 2022-02-05 21:56:40 no
general 2022-02-05 21:56:42 Worst thing to do
general 2022-02-05 21:57:03 If you have never had any experience with alcohol, don't recommend him anything
general 2022-02-05 21:57:21 Best thing to do is just wait it out Inventer
general 2022-02-05 21:57:32 Sleep as soon as possible
general 2022-02-05 21:57:54 My favourite is probably like that one uh

general 2022-02-05 22:47:55 bread with apples in them
general 2022-02-05 22:48:18 
general 2022-02-05 22:48:26 This was what it was supposed to be

general 2022-02-05 22:55:05 My dad (which is 210) fits in this thing just fine
general 2022-02-05 22:55:57 so long the female doesn't have a desire to become mad at anything and doesn't want your attention 24/7, you're fine

events-chat 2022-02-07 09:29:43 People are so unhappy about an event because they can't make their own designs?
events-chat 2022-02-07 09:33:35 Is it because most of you are addicted to motorlocking or?
events-chat 2022-02-07 09:34:01 Because pretty much every design will look the same lol
general 2022-02-07 11:24:24 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2022-02-07 11:24:32 Hi

general 2022-02-07 11:59:52 Jailbreak mf's when they unlock a new car
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:24:58 How are you struggling with 100 max block count lol
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:25:27 The objective of the event is tiny plane warfare
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:26:23 Also
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:26:24 
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:26:49 Yeah
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:26:55 It specifically says
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:03 No wait, you best read it yourself
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:20 Mate, how about you read the entire thing before starting to waste time
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:29 I am busy with the tutorials
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:27:50 Tincan is already that basically
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:10 well, for the event no
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:18 But otherwise looks like a pretty good small aircraft
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:25 Well
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:34 You have to recreate one of 3 planes
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:39 No custom planes for this event
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:28:57 Bro can you all read
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:29:01 Or do you just read the title
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:29:04 <:empty:794431705070174238>
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:29:21 
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:29:30 guh
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:29:45 Yes
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:30:44 If you don't like it, don't participate. Do not go complaining about it ty
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:30:48 Nothing
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:31:09 Or in case of the DOOF, firework pods and most likely guns
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:32:12 I am not the event organiser. But to make it balanced, make the speed of the heavy bomber about 150-170 with no guns and 2 maxed out explosive blocks
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:32:23 I am working on those
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:34:13 The YM-3 is already pretty unmanoeuvrable. I suggest adding 1 control surface for each wing; wings and tails
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:34:50 Holy fuck ok
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:34:55 54mb
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:35:00 Let's hope for like
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:36:00 If you do not own firework launchers, you can add 2 unguided missiles on whatever part of the plane you want
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:36:52 Puri needs to come online first. Don't want to push excessive things in events just yet
general 2022-02-07 12:38:22 Fastest off-road vehicle
general 2022-02-07 12:41:43 it's only 400k I think
general 2022-02-07 12:42:40 200k for all the extra upgrades
general 2022-02-07 12:42:47 So about 550k
general 2022-02-07 12:42:49 Very cheap
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:43:14 You fell off + ratio
events-chat 2022-02-07 12:45:24 Crop the video

general 2022-02-07 12:55:53 wow
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 13:00:59 Good plane, but wayyyy too fast, too much explosives and use of camera's which is bruh (use text instead or something i dunno plane crazy shit)
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 13:01:53 True, but in payload like that shouldn't move that fast lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 13:02:04 2 blocks max for the bombs i'd say
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 13:02:52 Cap the speed at 160 to compensate for that enormous payload you're carrying (bombers should be slow, not the second fastest plane in the event)
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 13:02:57 🗿

events-chat 2022-02-07 13:16:22 Yeah good
events-chat 2022-02-07 13:17:17 For context: the YM-3 has a max speed of 190 (210 when diving), bascially doesn't roll and is very unmanoeuvrable
events-chat 2022-02-07 13:19:16 Depends, i'm not the organiser
events-chat 2022-02-07 13:19:28 I'll send it to puri for well

general 2022-02-09 19:46:02 Them putting out fires so bad they should have cooked the pilot
general 2022-02-09 19:46:16 While I die to some measly fire in my fuel tank

general 2022-02-09 19:50:33 
general 2022-02-09 19:50:43 That shit should cook the pilot alive
general 2022-02-09 19:51:31 It is yes, but I am comparing it to other aircraft

general 2022-02-10 09:29:53 Think about parking, fuel efficiency, the fear of literally running someone over
general 2022-02-10 09:30:32 I'd much rather have an off-road vehicle for it. It's lighter, faster and can probably go more off-road than that thing

events-chat 2022-02-10 09:57:42 You can kamikaze, but without explosives
events-chat 2022-02-10 09:58:33 It's a dogfight event, not a 1944 naval battle recreation
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:30 Yes, but you are:
- Abandoning your team and stuff
- Not playing the event properly
- Making it very unfun for others that are actively enjoying the event
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:35 So no
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:01:40 It defeats the purpose of the event
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:02:49 Your armament should be fixed and facing forward, unless specified otherwise in the announcement
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:39 No extra engines?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:45 Standard designs
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:55 As It said
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:03 It is a **dogfight** event
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:09 Not a helicopter battle
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:16:20 And a big, easy target
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:16:34 You have an aircraft base which you can modify
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:16:58 No
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:17:05 Choose one of the 4 to build
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:22:37 <#621452102618578964>. Read it all.
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:23:32 Not answering any more of yo lazy ass unless it's actually important. The answer is no on every question unless it's something actually important that isn't looking for the grey zones of this event.
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:24:03 Goes for all of you btw ^
general 2022-02-10 10:46:24 Yep
events-chat 2022-02-10 11:01:02 Have you considered turning on your eyes
events-chat 2022-02-10 11:01:03 
events-chat 2022-02-10 11:04:59 If you use that one braincell you have currently, you will be able to figure out that this event is here because we want a balanced fight
events-chat 2022-02-10 11:05:43 So naturally, any modifications to the aircraft are made for either better gun placement or detailing
events-chat 2022-02-10 11:05:55 🗿

events-chat 2022-02-14 14:14:43 Ok
events-chat 2022-02-14 15:03:17 During excessive testing, it has shown that the bombers can easily return to base. Even when they are heavily damaged.
events-chat 2022-02-14 15:05:33 As well as that, bombers are made to bomb and return to base. 1 gun can tear any defending plane to shreds if you aim well enough. We don't want to turn bombers into gunships.

events-chat 2022-02-16 09:01:18 Momen
general 2022-02-16 09:02:24 This was created because the residents were complaining about the noise lo
general 2022-02-16 09:03:03 In a war situation this is useless
general 2022-02-16 09:04:09 Not only that but it serves no purpose
general 2022-02-16 09:04:20 You can still hear it
general 2022-02-16 09:04:25 🗿
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:55:34 The bombers' speed is capped between 120 - 130 horizontal speed to **balance** it. There is no definitive speed number because we allowed people to make modifications to their aircraft (some wings added/removed, different configuration etc). The precise reason we replaced the engines on the yousuf is so that it would not be fast. If you would use that almond brain of yours for once and take the advice I have given you (twice) and just play the event how it's supposed to, you wouldn't have wasted your time.
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:56:34 If you want to make a custom plane for an event, do so; but not in this one.

general 2022-02-16 11:08:32 I can like auto's, especially the Lancer 10 (not the evo)

general 2022-02-23 12:44:18 Not a chance. They will only draft airforce employees or when war breaks out on Dutch soil
general 2022-02-23 12:45:07 Not yet
general 2022-02-23 12:45:32 Even if I want to go to the front, they won't accept that request
general 2022-02-23 12:45:47 I gotta work there full time in order to get a chance at being drafted
general 2022-02-23 12:47:40 They need mechanics for home defense as well so the most skilled mechanics will get to the front first anyway
general 2022-02-23 12:48:03 Since yes, Russian 'Bears' fly over our airspace regularly
general 2022-02-23 12:48:53 They fly to the UK via our airspace lol

general 2022-03-01 12:48:19 QOTD:
When racing, what position do you get pressured by the most? Chasing or leading?
general 2022-03-01 12:50:43 I get more pressure when chasing since I can't stick to my own pace without losing the one in front of me
general 2022-03-01 12:50:57 The fear of crashing into the leading car is just too great for me
general 2022-03-01 12:52:02 Chasing is fun with go-karting because nobody else I kart with is fast enough to be a challenge
general 2022-03-01 12:52:14 Pretty ego-ish but it's true
general 2022-03-01 12:55:01 That's part of the skill though. Put some pressure, wait for them to screw up on a corners exit, take a different line and zoom past or beside them when they open up space on the straight
general 2022-03-01 12:55:11 Always put your kart on the inside of a corner
general 2022-03-01 12:56:26 Let them pass and do a switcharoo
general 2022-03-01 12:56:30 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-03-01 12:56:43 That's what I always do
general 2022-03-01 12:56:55 They get surprised and pressured when you let them pass you
general 2022-03-01 12:57:09 Then out of the blue, go into a blind spot and pass them
general 2022-03-01 12:57:23 You'll never see them again for the rest of the race
general 2022-03-01 12:57:28 👍
general 2022-03-01 12:58:04 Or an even better tactic, screw up their rhythm
general 2022-03-01 12:58:09 Both
general 2022-03-01 12:58:16 But due to shitweather mostly indoors
general 2022-03-01 12:58:19 Gas
general 2022-03-01 12:59:40 If you go fast enough, you can't help but slide a few corners
general 2022-03-01 12:59:45 But you are in control of those
general 2022-03-01 13:00:02 Wears the tyres so I mostly stay a little slower the first few laps
general 2022-03-01 13:03:25 Not bumpy at all, but on one bit it is a bit bumpy near a high speed hairpin exit

creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:04:07 Hi simple questions you will need to answer thanks.
A. Did you ask for feedback on your builds?

B. Why are you angry

Asking for advice comes with criticism. To me it seems that you didn't take that criticism too well.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:07:37 Unless of course you can prove it to me otherwise

creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:10:48 Aight aight gentlemen let's settle this a little more maturely thanks
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:11:31 For all of you, stop with the toxicity. It isn't asked for in the slightest.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:13:33 Best advice I can give you right now is to ignore these fellas. They obviously want to cause unnecessary drama. If you ask for advice in the future, expect this response and simply ping a moderator and leave it at that. The channel description can be your reminder. Arguments like these are to be avoided even if it knocks you off of your high horse.
general 2022-03-09 00:13:52 What do you drive if I may ask?
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:12 People wait weeks for their ticket to be tended to
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:35 All I can say is to avoid a futher waiting time is to supply us with **all** the info we need
creations-chat 2022-03-09 00:14:45 Avoid a back and forth response time in tickets.

general 2022-03-09 00:26:56 hi
general 2022-03-09 00:28:16 I have done so many fucking cayo heists so I can help you out if you need another person
general 2022-03-09 00:28:27

general 2022-03-09 00:28:53 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-03-09 00:29:33 Cayo is very easy once you follow a certain path
general 2022-03-09 00:30:07 Do you use the Ethernet cable glitch thing?
general 2022-03-09 00:30:26 Yes it is but rockstar doesn't notice it lo
general 2022-03-09 00:31:26 As long as you make it easy (submarine approach) i'm down
general 2022-03-09 00:31:43 Well most of the times prepping is best done alone
general 2022-03-09 00:32:04 Drainage tunnel is the only one you should do
general 2022-03-09 00:32:39 Rather difficult, basically when the screen turns green (at the end of the heist) you pull the cable out of the PC
general 2022-03-09 00:32:54 You will still receive the money, but the heist doesn't reset
general 2022-03-09 00:33:10 Granting you the same loot, and you don't have to prep the heist
general 2022-03-09 00:33:14 You can just do it again
general 2022-03-09 00:33:28 Yeah then you need to prep again etc
general 2022-03-09 00:33:34 Different loot etc

general 2022-03-09 00:36:15 Depends on the loot, but 1m at least

general 2022-03-28 16:23:09 Little resistance in your mouth, from the fork directly into your mouth etc
general 2022-03-28 16:23:30 Soup is an exception because soup is only edible when it's Tomato soup

general 2022-03-30 09:40:28 I'm actually really considering buying this
general 2022-03-30 09:45:06 Most likely outright
general 2022-03-30 09:45:27 Depends on how cheap they become second hand
general 2022-03-30 09:45:35 24k euro's
general 2022-03-30 09:45:37 new
general 2022-03-30 09:45:45 It is a Toyota
general 2022-03-30 09:45:48 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-03-30 09:46:02 No
general 2022-03-30 09:46:10 Those are expensive
general 2022-03-30 09:46:15 Even more so than this
general 2022-03-30 09:46:34 Good luck finding one that is not a fucked up project car
general 2022-03-30 09:46:49 I don't know, depends if people like it or not
general 2022-03-30 09:47:01 My guess it's gonna become more expensive
general 2022-03-30 09:47:13 So i'll buy it directly from Toyota dealers
general 2022-03-30 09:47:38 Bud of mine got a GR Supra in silver-grey already
general 2022-03-30 09:47:57 So i'll most likely get it in white
general 2022-03-30 09:48:11 They are not in dealers yet
general 2022-03-30 09:48:23 The car is brand new
general 2022-03-30 09:48:29 Released this year
general 2022-03-30 09:48:44 Full scale production isn't a go just yet
general 2022-03-30 09:49:10 But seeing it's price and looks, i'd be happy to own one
general 2022-03-30 09:50:26 Depends on your taste in my opinion
general 2022-03-30 09:51:43 If you like this, go for a BMW
general 2022-03-30 09:52:16 If you like this, go for an S13
general 2022-03-30 09:53:34 One is stanced with shitwheels and the other looks like a good car
general 2022-03-30 09:54:51 Yes, if you like camber, stupid rear bumper lips and untasteful wheels thee are free to remove thyself from my vision

general 2022-03-30 09:58:28 Yeah I am quite the clean freak when it comes to racing and looks
general 2022-03-30 10:00:31 Street drifting without any purposeful drift mods is more fun to watch then cars that have heavy drift mods such as 60 degree turning and widebodies etc
general 2022-03-30 10:01:50 I think I just met someone with the same taste as me
general 2022-03-30 10:04:55 I look for those cars as well, yet they are stupidly unreliable and expensive now
general 2022-03-30 10:05:16 I do own a somewhat 90's car I guess
general 2022-03-30 10:05:33 Borderline since the production started in 1999
general 2022-03-30 10:05:37 And mine is from 2000

general 2022-03-30 10:06:33 Cool in and of itself
general 2022-03-30 10:07:52 FWD can be very fun
general 2022-03-30 10:07:58 Integra's for example
general 2022-03-30 10:08:05 Or Celica's
general 2022-03-30 10:08:31 Oh yeah those are city cars
general 2022-03-30 10:08:50 Not the most exiting cars
general 2022-03-30 10:09:01 But FWD sport cars are very fun too
general 2022-03-30 10:10:56 Yeah they are
general 2022-03-30 10:11:00 But some are really nice
general 2022-03-30 10:11:18 Blue with some multispoke thin tyre rims look good

general 2022-04-12 08:24:52 You can't buy a Ferrari as easy as a Lamborghini so people won't even buy it
general 2022-04-12 08:25:10 There is legit no value coming from it
general 2022-04-12 08:26:06 Even then you need to have some significant relations with Ferrari
general 2022-04-12 08:26:37 But then again, every time I see an Urus on the highway I want to slam that mf so hard he flies on the opposite lane
general 2022-04-12 08:26:48 Ferrari's reputation
general 2022-04-12 08:27:10 With every car they released they direct you to other used cars first

general 2022-04-12 18:02:32 Those are the people that force themselves to "like" music to be "cool" or i'm just an absolute idiot
general 2022-04-12 18:03:51 If I was an American citizen I would have voted for him just so he would stop making "music"
general 2022-04-12 18:05:09 I only remember Drake because he looks funny

general 2022-04-15 12:56:20 Like mf I can tune the shit out of any car and beat it as well
general 2022-04-15 12:56:47 I'm certain my MR2 can keep up with every single last one of those cars if not beat them with enough tuning

general 2022-04-15 13:03:58 Yeah but still
general 2022-04-15 13:04:14 Normal 4 cylinder engines don't produce that much power
general 2022-04-15 13:04:40 For example the Volvo XC60 has a 1.8 I4 twin turbo diesel engine
general 2022-04-15 13:04:45 Only produces 180
general 2022-04-15 13:05:16 Yes
general 2022-04-15 13:05:26 yes
general 2022-04-15 13:05:34 ask elsewhere
general 2022-04-15 13:06:29 Yeah true, but I don't think any 3 cylinder engine has produced that much power

general 2022-05-09 16:28:22 DM me what they did
general 2022-05-09 17:39:32 If you spend money on a free game there is a difference yes
general 2022-05-09 17:40:10 One is a lunatic who isn't financially wise enough to make good decisions and one is enjoying the game how it's supposed to be played
general 2022-05-09 17:41:11 Pay to win is only a valid argument for those with low patience or anger management issues
general 2022-05-09 17:41:47 Sucks to be them
general 2022-05-09 17:42:30 War Thunder is  great example
general 2022-05-09 17:42:47 Mfs be paying 60 euro's to get good tanks, yet have massive skill issue
general 2022-05-09 17:43:19 Nahnahnah
general 2022-05-09 17:43:40 There is a whole side of the tech tree dedicated to vehicles you gotta pay for
general 2022-05-09 17:43:54 At least 30 vehicles per nation
general 2022-05-09 17:44:54 It's the source of income, but game devs tend to make the game unbalanced lol
general 2022-05-09 17:45:47 People spend hundreds on a game
general 2022-05-09 17:45:52 Wasted money
general 2022-05-09 17:46:36 stop at 5.7 for every nation
general 2022-05-09 17:46:44 There is no need to grind anymore
general 2022-05-09 17:47:36 I have never ever spend money on a free game
general 2022-05-09 17:47:53 I got lucky with giveaways or gifts from others
general 2022-05-09 17:48:04 It can be fun, but you gotta know what you are doing
general 2022-05-09 17:48:15 Try playing at 3.7 and cap there
general 2022-05-09 17:48:25 Don't bother playing more since it's not worth your time
general 2022-05-09 17:48:39 3.7 is the perfectly balanced battle rating
general 2022-05-09 17:49:41 People actually like playing at the highest tiers and I don't get why
general 2022-05-09 17:50:05 How is shooting Air to Air missiles or firing literal tungsten darts at each other fun
general 2022-05-09 17:50:27 wait wait what game?
general 2022-05-09 17:51:05 Cool description, you should put that in your bio

general 2022-05-10 12:57:28 These didn't look like nice people
general 2022-05-10 12:57:57 Sells for quite a bit. Cut the roof open and you got yourself a new car
general 2022-05-10 12:58:15 Parking it behind the other cars for the week
general 2022-05-10 12:59:10 Yes but they don't know that
general 2022-05-10 13:04:05 
general 2022-05-10 14:12:57 Ok car is safe
general 2022-05-10 14:13:36 How to outsmart the dumb car burglars: Take out the battery of the car
general 2022-05-10 14:13:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-05-10 14:14:08 2 cars with 3 people in each drove by my house and took pictures of my car
general 2022-05-10 14:14:19 I tried to get their number plates but those were so dirty
general 2022-05-10 14:14:35 So I parked our family cars in front and took out the car battery
general 2022-05-10 14:14:43 those dumbasses got outsmarted
general 2022-05-10 14:15:01 Yes
general 2022-05-10 14:15:21 I can use other cars and I am working from home till the weekend
general 2022-05-10 14:15:29 No
general 2022-05-10 14:15:31 Broad daylight
general 2022-05-10 14:15:40 Just casually stopped in front of my house
general 2022-05-10 14:15:46 rolled the window down
general 2022-05-10 14:15:51 And took a few pictures
general 2022-05-10 14:15:52 then left
general 2022-05-10 14:16:06 No
general 2022-05-10 14:16:20 Yeah
general 2022-05-10 14:17:04 Yeah but who tf steals those
general 2022-05-10 14:17:31 Bro i'm a fucking genius
general 2022-05-10 14:17:56 You are lucky we don't have a basement
general 2022-05-10 14:18:24 Battery is simpler
general 2022-05-10 14:18:54 By then I will have their license plates
general 2022-05-10 14:18:56 And their faces
general 2022-05-10 14:19:01 Maybe even one of their legs
general 2022-05-10 14:19:15 Rusty bayonets leave a mark
general 2022-05-10 14:20:20 You don't take a picture of some random ass car and take off
general 2022-05-10 14:20:24 So yes
general 2022-05-10 14:20:26 Yes they will
general 2022-05-10 14:20:48 Unless they caught our camera on their photo
general 2022-05-10 14:21:23 Convertibles are easy to steal
general 2022-05-10 14:21:41 But with the handbrake on and with no battery in it, it's going nowhere
general 2022-05-10 14:24:25 It will, but that would be a short term solution
general 2022-05-10 14:24:43 <:ElonCelebrate:589671476337311755>
general 2022-05-10 14:25:00 Better size*
general 2022-05-10 14:25:45 Small cars fit anywhere, big cars only good to haul stuff
general 2022-05-10 14:26:10 Because you see hatches literally EVERYWHERE
general 2022-05-10 14:26:28 And I have an addiction with being original
general 2022-05-10 14:26:53 Shits the ultimate example
general 2022-05-10 14:27:29 Yes but you see them everywhere
general 2022-05-10 14:28:27 Unreliable
general 2022-05-10 14:29:10 expensive
general 2022-05-10 14:29:25 And not fuel efficient
general 2022-05-10 14:29:39 A better hatch for me is uh
general 2022-05-10 14:29:43 Well not a hatch per se
general 2022-05-10 14:29:59 Not cool enough
general 2022-05-10 14:30:24 
general 2022-05-10 14:30:35 It's roof hinged so it's technically a hatch
general 2022-05-10 14:31:06 It's called a glass roof
general 2022-05-10 14:31:35 It look really good
general 2022-05-10 14:33:01 Hear me out
general 2022-05-10 14:33:03

general 2022-05-20 17:04:12 hi

general 2022-05-20 17:07:36 You have just insulted the man who made drifting popular
general 2022-05-20 17:08:02 https://tenor.com/view/tsuchiya-pushing-guy-gif-4929873
general 2022-05-20 17:08:22 It is, but it's not fast
general 2022-05-20 17:08:48 Drifting is cool, but grip is fast
general 2022-05-20 17:08:53 Therefor grip is more cool
general 2022-05-20 17:08:56 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-05-20 17:09:32 
general 2022-05-20 17:10:00 Let me tell you, this mf FAST
general 2022-05-20 17:10:36 He's almost as good as me
general 2022-05-20 17:10:39 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-05-20 17:12:58 Drift is only faster on low speed and tight corners
general 2022-05-20 17:13:11 And even then if you can't recover well you still lose time
general 2022-05-20 17:13:59 that's because 4WD vehicles can recover well from a corner
general 2022-05-20 17:15:16 i.e. recovery
general 2022-05-20 17:21:37 It's almost impossible
general 2022-05-20 17:22:39 Even with 50/50 weight distribution you cannot execute a drift with no countersteer in RWD cars
general 2022-05-20 17:22:42 however
general 2022-05-20 17:22:49 Powersliding IS possible
general 2022-05-20 17:23:02 If we are talking about a powerslide you can easily do that
general 2022-05-20 17:23:24 So a powerslide
general 2022-05-20 17:24:01 Send me a video of it happening rn
general 2022-05-20 17:24:38 Because there ain't no way someone drifts with no countersteer irl
general 2022-05-20 17:25:01 Drifting is sliding through a corner sideways that you prepare BEFORE you enter the corner
general 2022-05-20 17:25:14 Powersliding is sliding through AFTER entering
general 2022-05-20 17:26:13 So they are using some kind of LSD or are actually powersliding
general 2022-05-20 17:31:20 Guh these are just 20 degree bends
general 2022-05-20 17:31:27 Of course they slide
general 2022-05-20 17:31:32 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-05-20 17:31:59 We are talking about uh
general 2022-05-20 17:32:05 Actual corners
general 2022-05-20 17:32:46 you do lol
general 2022-05-20 17:32:55 https://tenor.com/view/wrc-rally-drift-gif-7615150
general 2022-05-20 17:32:59 You do
general 2022-05-20 17:33:16 Of course
general 2022-05-20 17:33:37 Yes, that is why it's not possible my guy
general 2022-05-20 17:33:56 Actual bends in the road with no clear and straight line
general 2022-05-20 17:34:11 4WD cars can power through with little to no countersteer
general 2022-05-20 17:34:16 But RWD cars literally can't
general 2022-05-20 17:34:54 A drift means you slide through a corner and prepare for it
general 2022-05-20 17:35:07 A powerslide is sliding without preparing for it
general 2022-05-20 17:35:55 That is literally what i'm saying lol
general 2022-05-20 17:36:21 Yes, and that is only possible with 4WD cars
general 2022-05-20 17:36:45 I'd like to see mister Ken Miles drift through an actual corner without counter steering in a RWD car
general 2022-05-20 17:36:56 Those are mind bends with an almost straight racing line
general 2022-05-20 17:37:00 Of course they only slide
general 2022-05-20 17:39:03 Sliding because of G forces in a mild bend isn't drifting mate
general 2022-05-20 17:40:02 Drifting = Making a car go sideways BEFORE entering the corner
general 2022-05-20 17:40:16 The video you sent is literally a mild bend
general 2022-05-20 17:40:21 Not a corner in my terms
general 2022-05-20 17:40:43 These are just powersliding through them
general 2022-05-20 17:40:52 Wdym don't agree with
general 2022-05-20 17:40:59 I literally see no car preparing for a drift
general 2022-05-20 17:41:07 They all just slide to the side a little
general 2022-05-20 17:41:13 💀
general 2022-05-20 17:41:55 Even FWD cars do that
general 2022-05-20 17:41:59 Every car does
general 2022-05-20 17:42:11 If you barely have any downforce, you will slide
general 2022-05-20 17:44:01 It was a discussion about RWD being able to **drift** through a corner without countersteer
general 2022-05-20 17:44:41 But providing me a video of cars sliding through a mild bend because they lack downforce and grip isn't drifting
general 2022-05-21 09:27:25 Alright so this one guy that is building the world in minecraft has already built my town

general 2022-06-04 13:35:06 I haven't played with them yet but I find myself really fucking good in the AA department
general 2022-06-04 13:35:17 So for the sake of others I won't play any of them
general 2022-06-04 13:36:18 It is annoying sure but they are very easy to shoot down
general 2022-06-04 13:36:54 I mean if you are playing heavy tanks you are basically asking to be bombed lol
general 2022-06-04 13:37:30 He's a smart one
general 2022-06-04 13:38:21 Ah yes, premium vehicle spam, unbalanced vehicles (ZSU-57-2) and CheatFS. Very fun.
general 2022-06-04 13:39:05 3.7 is the most balanced BR there is and you literally cannot convince me otherwise
general 2022-06-04 13:39:19 Because it only targets tanks
general 2022-06-04 13:39:53 You get like the best gun at that BR what do you mean

general 2022-06-04 13:40:21 Anything can kill you
general 2022-06-04 13:40:47 Except everyone is too stupid to understand where to shoot
general 2022-06-04 13:42:06 People that say this charge onto any point they see and flock to the front lines of the battle
general 2022-06-04 13:42:22 Mf's are in a heavy tank with a great, long range gun and they play as they are medium tanks
general 2022-06-04 13:42:31 (I know)
general 2022-06-04 13:42:39 (It wasn't directed at you)
general 2022-06-04 13:43:18 Primary targets at 6.7*

general 2022-06-04 13:43:56 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2022-06-04 13:44:05 He's evolved
general 2022-06-04 13:44:41 Overused vehicle =  everyone knows how to kill it
general 2022-06-04 13:45:28 I know you?
general 2022-06-04 13:46:05 Nice to meet you
general 2022-06-04 13:46:59 I have had 0 problems with it before
general 2022-06-04 13:47:07 But that's because I always aim for weakspots

general 2022-06-04 17:24:55 Incoming F-35 haters
general 2022-06-04 17:26:06 One is an export multirole fighter and the other isn't an export multirole fighter
general 2022-06-04 17:26:34 They both are?
general 2022-06-04 17:26:37 💀
general 2022-06-04 17:27:15 Then tell my why it can carry highly accurate ground striking armament
general 2022-06-04 17:28:11 So because one isn't in the navy its not a multirole fighter
general 2022-06-04 17:30:59 If it has ground striking equipment, its use is for multiple purposes. Its **main** purpose is air defense
general 2022-06-04 17:31:17 Yet thats every fighters main purpose

general 2022-06-04 17:48:07 High speed is of the old days
general 2022-06-04 17:49:21 Then you can explain to me how you are going to make a radar so strong it burns through jammers more powerful than anything we have ever seen before
general 2022-06-04 17:50:23 Stealth has been used actively during the Gulf war by the F-117 and it has proven that it's the future for the coming fighter generations
general 2022-06-04 17:50:45 If your enemy can't see you, you can't avoid destruction
general 2022-06-04 17:51:55 I'm just fucking tired of 12 year old jet enthusiasts shitting on the F-35 because "it's not going to work"
general 2022-06-04 17:52:53 Give me at least one piece of information regarding your statement where it has been actively used in actual combat conditions
general 2022-06-04 17:54:48 Bro that is exactly my point
general 2022-06-04 17:55:01 Nobody knows how good it is because it has NEVER seen combat yet

general 2022-06-22 21:13:24 Just how
general 2022-06-22 21:13:32 so was I!
general 2022-06-22 21:13:39 No I won't wtf
general 2022-06-22 21:14:25 The only fucking explanation I got for that is literally being so bad yet buying and playing the most expensive vehicles you have
general 2022-06-22 21:16:58 Question: Do you also spend every penny you earn irl?
general 2022-06-22 21:17:23 not just wt
general 2022-06-22 21:22:17 It's literally a better F-5
general 2022-06-22 21:23:21 and much more successful than pretty much any domesticly maintained and operated multirole fighter that the US has currently
general 2022-06-22 21:24:13 Take one look at the fatass-22 and you'll change your opinion
general 2022-06-22 21:25:01 I don't get your statement
general 2022-06-22 21:25:07 Because the F22 is literally more fat
general 2022-06-22 21:25:44 I have seen both
general 2022-06-22 21:25:48 As in real life
general 2022-06-22 21:26:13 I am not an in-game moderator
general 2022-06-22 21:27:11 The Su-57, if used recently, has shown that it's another MiG-25 situation
general 2022-06-22 21:28:09 but legit, the F-22 is way fatter than the F-35. I've seen both irl so you ain't changing my mind with fucking google pictures
general 2022-06-22 21:28:13 💀
general 2022-06-22 21:28:51 Get me some documents on it being used in actual combat and you can make that statement make sense
general 2022-06-22 21:29:20 I'm not saying it can, i'm saying nobody actually knows
general 2022-06-22 21:29:44 but kids online be screaming at it because it's a stealth fighter/bomber that is pretty expensive and "ugly"
general 2022-06-22 21:30:12 Okay so what you're basically saying is that a stealth fighter/bomber is bad because it looks like it
general 2022-06-22 21:30:31 Bro I need to stop arguing with actual children

general 2022-06-22 21:34:02 I'm exited to work on it and i'm not going to let some dumbass minor tell me his beloved cold war era fighter is better than a modern, state of the art fighter/bomber which they will never even work on or maintain

general 2022-07-10 15:29:36 You can easily clap some german ass that way and live while getting like 3 kills
general 2022-07-10 15:29:53 Ambush if you get the chance as well
general 2022-07-10 15:30:02 Let them come to you

general 2022-07-10 21:31:53 Epic
general 2022-07-10 21:34:45 I don't grind anything since I play for fun but I mostly play US or USSR
general 2022-07-10 21:35:27 Anything under 7 because thats somewhat fun
general 2022-07-10 21:35:54 3.7 and 5.7 are the most fun imo
general 2022-07-10 21:36:12 Its eh
general 2022-07-10 21:36:42 I play light tanks though so I don't rely on armour anyway
general 2022-07-10 21:37:17 
general 2022-07-10 21:38:36 Depends on your playstyle
general 2022-07-10 21:39:25 M42 is worth it
general 2022-07-10 21:39:41 AA is the most fun I can have
general 2022-07-10 21:39:51 Yes but much better chassis
general 2022-07-10 22:22:09 It's 00:21. On a sunday. I live in a neighbourhood full of new homes.
general 2022-07-10 22:22:18 There is a fucking cow mooing outside my window..
general 2022-07-10 22:22:46 Oh wait nevermind
general 2022-07-10 22:22:52 It's some fat girl with friends
general 2022-07-10 22:30:20 Hear me out: C-One bumper and skirt kit
general 2022-07-10 22:30:37 Cheap, low effort and durable
general 2022-07-10 22:31:37 I love this bumper...

general 2022-07-10 22:37:36 Will look somewhat like this
general 2022-07-10 22:54:09 Alright, I think i'm buying a kit.
general 2022-07-10 22:55:25 If I do an engine mod it's most likely going to be an exhaust header + manifold replacement
general 2022-07-10 22:55:49 After that install either a K20 or 2ZZ engine
general 2022-07-10 22:55:55 140
general 2022-07-10 22:56:02 But she only weight 950kg
general 2022-07-10 23:02:43 Getting the colour code for the MRS, ordering the paint + kit and assembling it
general 2022-07-10 23:03:51 I think it's around 750 euro's max
general 2022-07-10 23:04:05 ikr
general 2022-07-10 23:04:13 And it will look amazing
general 2022-07-10 23:04:27 
general 2022-07-10 23:04:31 Rough look for it
general 2022-07-10 23:04:42 Same colour with the kit on it

general 2022-07-11 16:24:24 People that praise the 'JDM' legends and nothing else
general 2022-07-11 16:28:01 According to most children that are "into cars" yet don't even know what an exhaust header is, Drifting is faster than anything, 4 cars need to be praised (Skylines, Supra's, RX-7 FD's and Evo's), their icon car will always be faster than anything and they cannot learn to appreciate other cars that roam the planet
general 2022-07-11 16:29:26 The NSX is somewhat overhyped though (mostly because owners tend to make them look shit)
general 2022-07-11 16:30:33 Your average NSX owner drives these
general 2022-07-11 16:31:24 Most do
general 2022-07-11 16:32:18 A riced out beetle is what it is
general 2022-07-11 16:34:38 Imo better than the NSX
general 2022-07-11 16:35:42 Integra Type R
general 2022-07-11 16:36:17 Track tuned beetles less gooo
general 2022-07-11 16:36:38 Its true
general 2022-07-11 16:36:50 Porsche can't make good looking cars
general 2022-07-11 16:36:54 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-07-11 16:37:11 The cayman is an exception

general 2022-07-11 16:45:07 (Its not)
general 2022-07-11 16:46:02 And a much better rear
general 2022-07-11 16:46:55 Thats why its good
general 2022-07-11 16:53:23 Top 5 Japanese car list for me is still: 
1: MR2's
2: Integra (type R)
3: MX-5 (Mostly NB and ND)
4: S2K's 
5: S chassis Nissans
general 2022-07-11 16:54:36 (Only SW20's)
general 2022-07-11 16:54:54 And the NSX has it as well 💀
general 2022-07-11 16:55:25 Again an SW20 model
general 2022-07-11 16:57:25 This is what I mean with people barely knowing any Japanese sports cars except the "famous" (overrated) ones
general 2022-07-11 16:58:03 True

general 2022-07-11 16:58:47 No fuck you
general 2022-07-11 16:59:42 This beauty does NOT deserve a wing that big
general 2022-07-11 17:00:04 Get a TRD wing
general 2022-07-11 17:00:43 Partly agreed

general 2022-07-11 17:02:22 Yes
general 2022-07-11 17:04:17 If you haven't noticed yet, I like 4-cylinder cars
general 2022-07-11 17:04:36 Fuel efficient, high revving and decent power delivering cars
general 2022-07-11 17:04:56 Anything but Germany
general 2022-07-11 17:05:23 Literally whats in most volvos dumb canadian
general 2022-07-11 17:05:28 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-07-11 17:06:58 VVTi lift sounding kinda dope
general 2022-07-11 17:07:52 11K can be sustained, but not for long periods of time
general 2022-07-11 17:07:59 Initial D was wrong about it

general 2022-07-11 17:11:12 I appreciate how it sounds, but there is NO way I am ever buying something bigger than a V6
general 2022-07-11 17:11:43 I am not power hungry
general 2022-07-11 17:12:04 Max i'll tune that MR2 of mine to is 230 hp

general 2022-07-11 17:12:52 I'd rather spend my money on a supercharger kit for it's 1.6 I4
general 2022-07-11 17:14:22 Something about that high pitch gets me going
general 2022-07-11 17:14:41 And most of the time they are much easier to install than a turbo
general 2022-07-11 17:15:29 Luckily my engine is in the back so it's not that expensive for me

general 2022-07-23 18:23:48 It means I am suspecting you of having an alt account in this server

general 2022-07-23 18:33:45 Breaking rules and them being enforced has nothing to do with toxicity though
general 2022-07-23 18:33:46 lmao
general 2022-07-23 18:35:56 You can only submit creations you made AND designed yourself. A tutorial is a build that someone else made and therefor you cannot post it in <#384025409945337856>
general 2022-07-23 18:36:49 The base is still a build you can't take credit for
general 2022-07-23 18:37:27 Therefor we are obliged to remove tutorial builds from the creation channel
general 2022-07-23 18:46:57 That reminds me, yesterday a guy told me his beloved Supra MK4 can beat my MR2 in a tight, sharp 90 degree bend

general 2022-07-25 11:12:44 Too new
general 2022-07-25 11:12:58 Come back when you're building piston engined planes
general 2022-07-25 11:13:59 Mayhaps
general 2022-07-25 11:14:51 It's a weird way of how this community works
general 2022-07-25 11:15:03 It's almost like the 'JDM' community
general 2022-07-25 11:15:16 There are planes everyone dislikes because it's overrated
general 2022-07-25 11:16:09 but planes like the MiG-21, F-14, F-15, F-18 and other likewise fighters are not hated despite being as overrated as the A-10
general 2022-07-25 11:17:17 Given the reasoning people hate the A-10 they should be as hated if not more
general 2022-07-25 11:18:19 It's with every community that only appreciates very few aspects of the things they love tbh
general 2022-07-25 11:20:27 I bet, if any of the good builders in here decide to make piston engined bombers they would receive MUCH more appreciation
general 2022-07-25 11:20:39 The thing <#384025409945337856> lacks is originality imo
general 2022-07-25 11:21:23 It's just well known jet after well known jet
general 2022-07-25 11:21:32 Too overhyped
general 2022-07-25 11:21:40 build something barely anyone knows about

general 2022-10-11 15:49:55 Bruh
general 2022-10-11 15:50:29 Yousuf retired not long after me I think
general 2022-10-11 15:50:53 Still in contact with him though so 😎
general 2022-10-11 15:51:55 He's doing a lot better now
general 2022-10-11 15:52:20 Dude, honestly yes
general 2022-10-11 15:52:34 I have been working so hard and doing so many projects it's insane
general 2022-10-11 15:54:13 I work on the Nashorn in weekends now, i've started a new study that I am doing great at, decided to buy and race in go-kart circuits and build myself a hydrogen powered go-karts as a side project for the coming years
general 2022-10-11 15:54:47 Glad to say that this weekend the nashorn will be doing it's first test drive after the tree incident
general 2022-10-11 15:55:34 Let me show you what I mean.,..
general 2022-10-11 15:55:49 
general 2022-10-11 15:56:09 We installed the differential last sunday
general 2022-10-11 15:56:29 Sprocket, drivetrain and track parts were repaired and replaced
general 2022-10-11 15:56:47 New clutch has been installed because we fucking rekked the last one
general 2022-10-11 15:57:09 Only downside is that some parts are still bent so the bolts don't fit
general 2022-10-11 15:57:31 We drove sprocket first into a massive tree during Militracks last may
general 2022-10-11 15:57:40 The entire drivetrain was damaged
general 2022-10-11 15:59:14 I might have a picture or video of it being taken back into the museum
general 2022-10-11 16:01:01 I can't find a good video of it sadly
general 2022-10-11 16:01:13 nevermind

general 2022-10-11 16:06:39 Not really sure about yousuf but I think he did
general 2022-10-11 16:07:02 We were, but he didn't want to ruin my holiday + he had school
general 2022-10-11 16:07:08 I did pass by his house though

general 2022-10-11 18:24:42 I can't moderate as a full time job lol
general 2022-10-11 18:24:58 Discord servers aren't a company lol
general 2022-10-11 18:25:47 Not enough to live off of though
general 2022-10-11 18:28:08 The thing is, Plane Crazy can be a really good game
general 2022-10-11 18:28:24 But the fact that the physics are so... bad... just makes it unfun for me
general 2022-10-11 18:28:52 Like, I am getting an engineering degree and that will not help me one tiny bit to understanding this game
general 2022-10-11 18:30:59 Motorlock, torque limitations, weird weight physics, weird build angles and the most random things used for signaling lol

general 2023-01-10 13:57:55 It's not going to be as good as Initial D, but I really couldn't give less of a shit it looks awesome
general 2023-01-10 13:58:45 I think that after watching it, my car is going to get beaten badly
general 2023-01-10 14:00:03 <@720891502108344360> I also found a Unity game that you might be interested in
general 2023-01-10 14:00:18 Well shit
general 2023-01-10 14:00:20 you already know
general 2023-01-10 14:01:34 https://youtu.be/v5fRERvq5XE
general 2023-01-10 14:01:42 I got a pretty decent run in it
general 2023-01-10 14:02:49 They released a new game (up for pre-release sale on steam) called Touge Shakai
general 2023-01-10 14:03:48 Damn okay, is this multi player as well?
general 2023-01-10 14:04:12 Not yet. I think ones the full release drops it will go down
general 2023-01-10 14:05:52 Pretty cool looking as well
general 2023-01-10 14:06:06 It's pretty bad that I know the course as well
general 2023-01-10 14:08:32 <:stuff:908917207986208828>

general 2023-01-10 14:11:52 yep
general 2023-01-10 15:34:22 Does anybody here actively play airsoft? Most of you all are probably minors but Americans play it straight out of the womb almost so asking anyway
general 2023-01-10 15:36:04 Damn, I sure love playing like a call of duty lobby on a 40x40 square meter field
general 2023-01-10 15:37:26 I have a late British WW2 uniform and helmet, i'm just tryna buy a cheap ww2 firearm to complete the look
general 2023-01-10 15:38:18 Aye you know what would be cool
general 2023-01-10 15:39:13 Aye children of PCC, we can all block the guy and avoid dumbass political comments
general 2023-01-10 15:39:17 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-01-10 15:41:01 Anyway, do any of you know a site where I can order a cheap bolt-action or submachine airsoft gun from WW2 era? All the sites i've found are pretty expensive since they only offer replica's... <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-10 15:42:32 I have found a MP40 lookalike (AEG) that is decently cheap and it works well enough. Pretty sturdy mechanically and physically
general 2023-01-10 15:43:05 hello fuzzy
general 2023-01-10 15:43:41 Fuzzy, there was a guy in here just now trying to provoke people with anti-western remarks. Look into it pretty please :)

general 2023-01-13 12:29:46 Someone thought it would be funny to stab my car roof
general 2023-01-13 12:30:02 so I need to pay 1500 euro's for a new one
general 2023-01-13 12:30:14 Convertible
general 2023-01-13 12:31:12 Buildings, Lada's, heck maybe even a USSR flag
general 2023-01-13 12:31:43 I do but it's an old roof that already needed replacing since the leather is worn
general 2023-01-13 12:32:35 So I am either getting a hardtop which is cheaper but less fun or a new soft top which is quite expensive but I like it during the summer
general 2023-01-13 12:32:52 People are not needed per se

general 2023-01-31 11:56:25 It's PCC after all
general 2023-01-31 11:56:56 That once is multiplied every time it's brought up
general 2023-01-31 11:57:02 Look at whitename discrimination
general 2023-01-31 11:57:07 Literally everybody does it now
general 2023-01-31 11:58:20 I mean, if you're not on discord it won't really matter anyway
general 2023-01-31 11:58:24 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-31 11:59:45 The school system is still fucked as well though so what is your point? The bot works just fine lmao
general 2023-01-31 12:00:15 Because it's also something that isn't used 24/7
general 2023-01-31 12:01:21 Reason bringing up the school system is because it's a HECK of a tonne more important than some dumbass discord bot bruh
general 2023-01-31 12:01:58 With time everything can be fixed
general 2023-01-31 12:02:06 But have you thought about the personal lives of others
general 2023-01-31 12:02:07 prick
general 2023-01-31 12:02:43 Amazing priorities
general 2023-01-31 12:03:59 No offense, but why do you care lol
general 2023-01-31 12:04:36 Yeah well too bad
general 2023-01-31 12:04:44 I want 1 million dollars as well but hey
general 2023-01-31 12:05:46 Well damn!
general 2023-01-31 12:06:12 Let's fix it then shall we. What would you do
general 2023-01-31 12:06:41 Basic maintenance should be easy enough for you to do it no?
general 2023-01-31 12:06:53 Then why rely on it you idiot
general 2023-01-31 12:06:58 nah nah nah
general 2023-01-31 12:07:10 You want it fixed, yet don't want to put in any effort lmao
general 2023-01-31 12:07:42 Ask literally OBC or Hyper about it
general 2023-01-31 12:07:56 Explain your issue at hand and they will then decide if it's worth to fix (it's not)
general 2023-01-31 12:08:11 Man why am I arguing in here again
general 2023-01-31 12:09:09 If it doesn't work, you go to the place you bought it at no?
general 2023-01-31 12:09:17 Or am I in the wrong there as well?
general 2023-01-31 12:09:32 My car sometimes doesn't start, ah shit, let me contact toyota
general 2023-01-31 12:10:17 I wouldn't either lol
general 2023-01-31 12:10:41 Well damn! If I had a company sure
general 2023-01-31 12:10:57 Some discord bot is literally not that important
general 2023-01-31 12:12:36 I haven't had any updates about this server since like fucking august and back then it worked just fine
general 2023-01-31 12:14:05 I don't know what is wrong about it though, the main reason hyperbot exists is for mod commands, basic server management like filters etc
general 2023-01-31 12:14:34 If it's such a small problem then it wouldn't be on my list of priorities as well
general 2023-01-31 12:15:47 Has anybody told the staff team about it either
general 2023-01-31 12:16:44 I only know about some hickups the bot has
general 2023-01-31 12:17:05 When hickups happen it usually doesn't quite function properly
general 2023-01-31 12:18:39 Still though, if the problem was severe enough, it would have probably been solved already
general 2023-01-31 12:19:32 Cancel culture at it's finest
general 2023-01-31 12:21:45 Just fill in the formula no? Or what are they asking for?
general 2023-01-31 12:22:46 I mean, you have the formula for it
general 2023-01-31 20:13:00 Hi yousuf
