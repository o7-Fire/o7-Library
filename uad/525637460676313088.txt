plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:45:59 Can anyone help
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:46:18

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:47:44 Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s gotta be vertical but
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:48:53 How would that work tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:49:03 Because the 3rd fold is the rear of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:51:31 Have side mounted guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:51:58 Those helicopters were capable of having like
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:52:04 LMGâ€™s on the side
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:52:12 And probably some rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:53:18 Donâ€™t even need motor locks to make a canopy like that look good ngl

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:56:37 Though*
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 09:57:05 But the third fold is the rear fold
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:03:06 My pea brain has not come up with a solution
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:03:19 Iâ€™ve been staring at this thing for like 10 minutes

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:14:06 And Iâ€™m happy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:14:16 If this works
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:20:08 
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:20:13 Peabrain superiority
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:42:52 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:42:55 Good
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:44:16 Also if Iâ€™m not wrong they could have side mounted MG 3 machine guns
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:44:48 Not really high caliber but they were probably designed for infantry support ig
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 10:57:04 I just realised how stupid I amâ€¦â€¦.
