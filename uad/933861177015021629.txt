general 2022-12-14 15:29:48 Bro how has Rick not done the winter update tho christmas is legit in a little over a week 💀
general 2022-12-14 15:31:25 Didn’t know people would be so personally attacked by that lol but pc2 has been pushed back left and right by over 2 years now lol so I don’t know what to believe
general 2022-12-14 15:33:16 Either way this could have been finished a very long time ago if he got help earlier most definitely but don’t give a release date if your gonna push it back by a lot
general 2022-12-14 15:34:12 Probably but I don’t know what to believe
general 2022-12-14 15:42:35 Will there be any current normal updates before pc2 comes out like the winter update?

general 2023-04-25 21:01:18 There’s just waiting for consoles to get stronger
general 2023-04-25 21:01:21 To handle gta6
general 2023-04-25 21:01:29 Pc2 has no excuse
general 2023-04-25 21:01:36 It’s roblox 💀
general 2023-04-25 21:02:03 Computer nerd, you live up to your username
general 2023-07-01 20:31:03 Rick is the laziest dev bro 💀
general 2023-07-01 20:31:20 It’s been 2+ years and pc2 is still not out
general 2023-07-01 20:32:01 Then why should he even develop in the first place. Maybe he should quit and focus on his own damn personal issues
general 2023-07-01 20:32:17 Instead of stringing us along
general 2023-07-01 20:32:35 He has a job he doesn’t do pc for money
general 2023-07-01 20:32:54 Exactly
