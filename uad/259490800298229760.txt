general 2020-04-19 18:40:29 throwback to when i was on madattak twitter 3 years ago for building a quadcopter
general 2020-04-19 18:41:08 wym
general 2020-04-19 18:41:28 back then they were capped to 10 speed max each
general 2020-04-19 18:42:21 
general 2020-04-19 18:42:25 still have it
general 2020-04-19 18:42:40 then a modernized version

general 2020-04-19 18:47:13 i been playing for 3 years but i dont have any huge builds or anything giant
general 2020-04-19 18:47:31 def dont have as much experience as some of these people lol
general 2020-04-19 18:48:46 wish I knew how i found plane crazy way back then, there were like 20 people playing max, but there was always a lot of downtime with nobody else playing
general 2020-04-19 18:50:45 still riding the wave from that shoutout on madattaks twitter 3 years ago
general 2020-04-19 18:50:51 my pride and joy is that quadcopter
general 2020-04-19 18:53:39 so what altitude is considered space in this game
general 2020-04-19 18:53:45 like what altitude is there no atmosphere

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:09:59 wait ill just ask in help
help 2020-04-20 00:10:09 how do you make a conveyor engine?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:11:07 yeah its got such a strange design aerodynamically
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:11:17 probably wanna nose dive
help 2020-04-20 00:14:24 nvm. just gonna watch a tutorial i found
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:21:19 if I use more conveyor engines would it produce more thrust <@!177743269105500160>
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:21:33 not like spam them
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:21:40 but add one more at the front

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:21:56 it produces infinite thrust doesnt it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:22:08 jesus
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:22:09 ok got it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 00:22:10 thakns

help 2020-04-21 00:22:49 got a tutorial
help 2020-04-21 00:39:24 you can make a faux jet engine and then use a conveyor engine to actually power it
help 2020-04-21 00:45:41 ok the tutorial did not help at all
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:25:39 agggh not rounded enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:26:29 i will
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:26:33 making general shape first
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:31:42 ok much better
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:32:22 i dont
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:37:33 ok time to curve

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:44:51 that seems too hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:46:44 idk it just seems easier to form the shape of the hull and then form a curve around that
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:49:27 only like 1/3 done, if that
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:49:28 fuck me
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:56:20 1/3 done with the hull i mean
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:56:25 still holy shit
