plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:33:27 I mean atleast give me some things I can do to improve it
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:34:26 it is an older design 
mainly updated the arms, and recolored it
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:34:40 gonna compile the images of my newer tank
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:35:31 But it is fast and can outrun things like that
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:36:26 I do that to prevent the wheels from hitting the top of the hull making them stop, slowing it down
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:36:39 its and old design
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 16:39:26 It is a revamp of an older one
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 17:07:07 Using the tips people have given me, I am making some modifications to the tank :D
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 17:08:38 how so
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 17:12:59 I don't know how to do motor lock

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 18:51:03 plus you only saw one angle
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 20:48:28 it have turret now
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 01:35:32 After listening to people's feedback on how bad the previous version of this tank, I revamped it, making it almost unrecognizable

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 23:45:44 right now it has 32 motors
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 23:45:51 https://streamable.com/6ut0xs working

plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:36:02 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:36:10 because yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:40:29 next I'm gonna see how much weight my quadcopter can lift
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:41:29 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:41:51 do you know how ballast weights go
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:42:18 like how many blocks the weight is equal to
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:28:38 working on fleshing out this thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:28:59 making it not barebones
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:29:06 giving it some form
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:29:41 so its not a skeleton
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:30:34 gonna have to work on the propellers though so it can have more lift
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:31:42 quadcopter
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:32:48 its gonna be similar to this
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:54:32 it has enough helium
does not even need the propellers to fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:55:24 its not done yet 
so it's gonna have more weight
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 02:56:05 flight

I have literally seen nobody build a quadcopter
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 04:10:32 not nearly as many as jets, tanks, cars, etc
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 04:11:27 never have I seen one ingame
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 04:11:30 so they are rare
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 04:11:57 its gonna be painted, and decorated better
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 04:12:33 eh

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 03:15:32 yeah but trails look odd, and for some reason the cameras only wanna weld to the bottom, which is annoying when they collide

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:32:11 how to steer with conveyer tracks
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:32:49 anyone know
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:42:02 I've tried props on conveyor tracks, they suck, and custom tracks would be too big, not to mention laggy on my low end device
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:43:51 something I can't even see is keeping the turret from doing a full rotation
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:45:27 only thing I can think of is this motorlock, but the parts that are actually protruding don't even collide
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:50:21 why
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:56:49 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 14:57:18 okay it can make a full rotation now, good
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 15:09:10 I fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 15:09:15 but a hull tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 15:09:54 I really wanna use conveyor tracks, because they look the best, but I don't like steering them, and custom tracks would be too big
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 15:10:45 because of annoying boxes around parts, I couldn't really use wheels

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 05:08:13 maybe with a few machine guns, though machine guns re not too effective with air fights
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 05:27:52 maybe another flying german pill isn't such a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 05:32:41 forgot about limbs

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 06:03:14 did I mention I wanted something fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 06:27:04 I could easily tone it up
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 06:27:10 it is only on half
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 06:27:28 maybe once I get used to flying with keys instead of mouse
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 06:32:41 funny considering I do have a suicide bomb <:what:644996672048463942>

plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:10:38 yeah the nose is ugly
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:10:45 can you even call it a nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:10:46 wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:11:36 just a half ball looks bland
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:12:05 yeah, because sometimes explosives are a bit unreliable
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:12:20 so I'm making sure that it actually makes contact
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:13:41 whut

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:58:12 I have a handful of builds that use minimal motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:14 this bad boy
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:12:40 it is good because it takes up the same space as a disconnecter, but doesn't leave parts behind, though they can only be used in pvp mode or a private server, just make sure the blast pressure and blast radius are set to zero

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:08:05 sounds laggy
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:08:26 or do you mean 150 explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:08:42 makes more sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:09:05 though
would be fun to build something like that
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:09:18 but lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 20:24:08 I wanna build a steamboat

plane-crazy 2021-07-24 22:36:15 can't make it cover the whole thing because then that would block the stuff I am planning on adding

plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:23:17 no not really
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:23:46 fly by wire features would prolly allow us to do more advanced things
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:24:02 like automatically swinging the wings on an aircraft at a certain speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:24:10 deploying landing gear automatically
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:24:28 or atleast that is what I would like to do
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:25:34 I would love to figure out how to program a bot that can play plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:25:36 like
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:26:03 perhaps an automated bombardier
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:26:12 or bombsight
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 01:26:52 guns that automatically account for drop and other hings

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 00:08:54 chromebooks are best for school  because they are cheap, have long battery life, because of their heavy use of cloud services, if the chromebook gets lost or broken beyond repair, you can just buy a new one and log into it and everything is there

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:11:55 skill issue <:shrug:772787086905442305>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:23:45 I used windows 7 on my personal laptop for 6-7 years
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:23:56 you can change that
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:24:08 one of the first things I changed
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:25:50 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:26:45 my screen is smaller
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:27:04 it's 1080p, 15.6 inches
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:27:26 that's why
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:28:54 tbh the only thing I didn't like is that I couldn't open task manager by right clicking the Taskbar, but this was changed in an update
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:07 because I don't remember the keyboard shortcut
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:47 I went from an 8 year old laptop to a brand new gaming laptop soo
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:29:53 came preinstalled
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:30:37 yeah I know desktops are better
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:31:47 but since I'm a student, I need a laptop, and my old one was degrading quickly, so I looked for a new one to replace it, with the intention to use it until I could gather parts to build a pc
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:32:33 got a good deal on a gaming laptop, made a few minor upgrades to it and it's worked just fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:33:08 I haven't had to bring it to school yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:33:20 but my new one has better battery life than the old
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:33:44 partly because it has an igpu that it can use when not gaming to save power
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:40:45 i have uh
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:42:01 my laptop is a asus tuf a15, 16gb of ram (upgraded from 8) amd ryzen 5 4600h, gtx 1650 gddr6, a 500gb and secondary 1000gb ssd
