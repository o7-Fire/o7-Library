general 2021-08-20 03:58:24 ok so an infinite map would be cool and all for plane crazy 2 but wouldnt it be difficult to find other people in the map?
general 2021-08-20 03:59:01 im sure theres some ways to overcome that
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:00:43 an infinite map would be great and all but wouldnt it be easy to get lost
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:00:59 trold
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:01:55 are there gonna be an infinite amount of airports as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:02:04 just spawned randomly around the map

general 2021-11-17 10:14:49 They sound 9 years old
general 2021-11-17 10:14:58 Either that or they’re having an aneurysm
general 2021-11-17 10:15:37 <:BIG1:588443768806703124> <:BIG2:588443778554134540>

general 2021-11-17 10:17:39 Wow you have a pfp of that one German guy
general 2021-11-17 10:19:02 He still was a German guy
general 2021-11-17 14:22:29 It’s a beautiful day out :)
general 2021-11-17 14:22:38 You should come outside :)
general 2021-11-17 14:27:51 oh shit
general 2021-11-17 14:28:12 Rope them all to each other
general 2021-11-17 14:28:18 Make a single amorphous blob
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:29:29 What’s this?
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:29:44 Cringe
general 2021-11-17 14:30:00 Rope all of them together
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:30:24 It’s not bullying, it’s just fact
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:30:30 Shredders are just low effort
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:30:42 Why
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:31:01 Yeah news flash I don’t care
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:31:10 I could make that in 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:31:12 Easily
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:31:21 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:31:50 It’s still not impressive
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:32:07 Just shows that you are unable to build anything else
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:32:14 Aka lack of skill
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:32:52 You just put a bunch of cutters on a flying ball
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:32:57 Tell me how it’s skill
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:33:10 Basically yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:33:16 Probs followed a tutorial as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:33:29 
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:34:15 Man just admitted there’s others identical to his
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:34:52 Ah yes because there’s only 1 crappy shredder ball that’s red
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:35:10 Aircraft carriers and realistic planes are things that actually take effort
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:35:27 effort doesn’t mean 20 minutes of work and a tutorial or two
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:36:48 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:37:00 ‘No life’ bro you make shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:37:41 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:37:46 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:38:44 You can make a good fast fighter and just work on painting and colour later can’t you
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:39:12 Meant to reply to this
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 14:43:04 I guess that’s true
general 2021-11-18 09:30:31 Bru

general 2021-11-19 09:06:31 What’s the point of the dislike button then
general 2021-11-19 09:09:07 They probably removed it because they were tired of their rewind videos getting mass disliked lol
general 2021-12-02 14:42:31 Ye
general 2021-12-07 09:43:03 Yo
general 2021-12-10 13:55:16 Feel bad for gay people cause now they are associated with shredder bugs
