plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:21:15 its more like a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:22:18 Because every time it attacked another ship or boat it would fly out of the water
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:22:28 kinda like the ghost ships from sea of thieves

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:27:28 the reason they are different vehicles is because the plane is the reference image for the paintjob

creations-chat 2021-06-24 19:48:49 oh wait nevermind I got confused because it looked similar

I mainly thought it was the tutorial because of the edges of the wings
creations-chat 2021-06-24 19:52:45 oh cool
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:46:46 I feel like my plane is going to get a shit ton of downvotes

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 02:03:26 So i guess rickje might be working on a sequel to plane crazy. I think its a great Idea but I am also slightly worried because I have so many builds that I dont think could be Transferred into the new game.

creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:18:50 Btw why do you have so much beef with me I did nothing to you before this

creations-chat 2021-06-26 00:06:36 besides the oil rig already covers the entire plot so if I folded it, it would be longer than its width and would look silly

creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:32:45 You shouldnt be talking [Terrain specialist I Designer II]

Nothing im just saying you shouldnt
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:35:49 Is getting expert shipwright easier than expert terrain specialist plus Vtols are hard too make
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:37:51 I know Im talking about TranquilGaze

So then we both have some of the easiest ranks too get
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:42:03 Well I think thats what he said ya same with terrain
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:44:24 what would be considered the highest rank then
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:45:13 Big Boy Tank I made
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:49:20 I just used different shades of gray
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:49:50 Im not good when it comes too colouring tanks
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:50:02 Im fine with almost anything else
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:50:39 Because I like making German style tanks which are primarily grey I think
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:51:09 thats what the platform at the back was for
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:51:14 So im gonna do that now
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:51:55 So how do I make an AA turret again
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:52:03 Like a decent looking one
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:53:33 I think Ill make something like this then
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:53:43 If Im using trails as barrels
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:57:32 Oh my god you have lots of expert ranks
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:57:47 Shipwright
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:58:01 then you some special rank I think
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:58:04 ya that one
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 05:59:07 Can I see the ship?
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:00:20 Oh I saw that it looks amazing
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:02:22 Why does Hars downvote everything even if its amazing
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:02:44 if something has like 200 upvotes and 3 downvotes you know Hars downvoted it
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:06:55 why are you trying too get every blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:06:59 Ive only gotten one

plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:10:04 I dont talk too much here
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:14:23 Btw Ive been wondering this for a while, what does MaxTorque do in motors?
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:14:39 oh I thought so
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:14:49 I usually set it too max
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:14:53 is that any good?
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:15:41 Ok thankyou
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:21:58 I finished the AA turrets on my Tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:35:53 These are the Turrets
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:37:08 I was going to make them fully grey but made it navy blue
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:50:14 I think I should have posted my creation at a better time of the day
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:50:16 not Midnight
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:51:20 Why are Hars stadards so high

Thought so
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:51:49 should I just delete the post and post it tomorrow when more people are active?
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 06:52:13 ok
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:54:05 Does big = good?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:56:39 I was looking through hall of fame and I see this oil rig which is quite large but it had no detail at all but it was a few years ago so
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:59:22 looks chonky
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:03:22 Man the wheels on my railgun are huge, they are 4 blocks wide 3 blocks tall and 18 of them on each side
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:05:43 Then what would they be called AWACS
Cylinders?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:09:31 How can I improve on my Big Boy Tank
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:12:09 I did the slate because it looks better than just default and I didn't want to use metal because its too plain so what materials make sense?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:14:11 If I improve the Tank am I allowed to repost it because I edited it?
Ok good I do the paint first
creations-chat 2022-01-18 10:16:03 This helps thank you I will work on it tomorrow
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:41:52 So from yesterday I asked how too improve my tank, Bad news Im lazy and gave up on it

Good News Im Starting from scratch and making a better tank with the detail all put into it so I dont have too change everything later
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:44:09 can I? it has 47
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:51:08 Im not doing it for the ranks anymore
I just want too improve my building skills
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:02:12 so I should use a mix of materials together instead of just 1
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:07:37 The front of the tank so far I havent decided where too put the cockpit or whatever its called
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:37:59 My new tank is going too have guided missles instead of cannons
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:39:11 Work in progress vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:39:13 How too improve on it so far
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:44:32 I have no Idea
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:44:39 I just know its going too have tracks
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:44:51 I kinda based it off the sandcrawler
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:45:01 so Its going too have a big door at the back or something
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:45:40 I used a mixture of materials instead of just one so it looks better
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:53:28 Im think like some Land Carrier
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:53:59 It will have either small explosive tanks that I can deploy or Small Explosive planes
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:54:08 and some Guided Missles
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:54:46 because I have lots of vertical space too work with
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 04:54:58 so definitely the Missles
creations-chat 2022-01-20 05:34:13 Rat has 16 upvotes Including me

Ok? RBK is typing
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 06:08:52 I still dont know
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 06:09:00 Probably some kind of carrier
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 06:09:18 like a land aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 06:09:35 But better
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 06:09:57 It would be Obsolete in real life but this is roblox

creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:37:51 Now there are so many people building hallways and its so easy too get upvotes because its just a long thin room that can be  made in less than an hour

creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:43:23 I realise that but im talking about effort
Its stupid that a detailed good looking Vtol gets less upvotes than a Hallway: In my opinion
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:46:02 Well Im tired of going too creations everyday and seeing multiple hallways with dozens of upvotes and then builds that took more effort and hours too make get less than that, Especially if they look better.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:49:02 What car?
I didnt link any car
No I linked a hallway, vtol, and a dragon

creations-chat 2022-01-27 09:25:56 Pros and cons of unspeakable making that video.

Pros: It gave plane crazy more attention and players.

Cons: It gave plane crazy more attention from 4 year old kids.

Toddlers are idiots.
