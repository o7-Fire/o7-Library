help 2023-07-18 03:01:23 How to make the differential thing in the centre higher up without messing with the linkage to the wheels on the suspension
help 2023-07-18 03:58:23 Is there any way to make the universal joints smaller
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:59:01 building a working car mechanism thingy is making me insane i mean the hardest part is the rear bc of the differential and u joints to make a fully independent transmission with a differential 😭😭 (on mobile to make it less enjoyable)
help 2023-07-18 13:02:18 Wait wth is angle locking i'm just understanding motorlock after quitting for like a year
help 2023-07-18 13:10:35 (I'm a complete dumbass)
help 2023-07-18 13:11:57 seems like I don't have any use for it
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:12:57 So you know what a differential is? (sorry just rejoined on a diff account I don't have perms)
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:15:04 I made a working differential the only issue is making the universal joints for the independent rear sus not be completely massive (it's a video on <#478584971670454284> btw)
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:19:49 I'm not making it look good i just want to build it to know if it works
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:25:12 +mobile (i want to throw my phone so bad building it)(my computer is broken)
creations-chat 2023-07-18 13:27:27 Front wheel steering assembly has a single bar to prevent wobble lmao how will it go, if only cylinders could be bigger
help 2023-07-18 13:33:04 It still works
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:56:37 Outro music 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:57:09 blud does NOT know how to use caps in a sentence 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:57:58 🗣️💩💩💩
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:58:52 you know the steering right
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:59:08 i got the rack and pinion almost done, somehow made it work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 02:59:25 connection to steering rod is 🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:00:07 Really janky tho 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:00:30 Mtf making gears using stock blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:01:13 I just hate how when you spawn in you're gonna camera its annoying
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:06:07 Bro got mad💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:06:35 10yo kids get mad when someone finds out their actual age 💀

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:09:56 15 (real)
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:10:19 I seriously can't comprehend there are people born in 2010 that are old enough to use discord
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:10:46 I mean
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:11:02 You can be 8 and still use discord but its obvious
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:11:16 kids love doing things that older ppl do
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:11:42 you could probably report that kid but i wont
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:11:50 cant bother
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:12:10 There was an 8yo here a few minutes ago
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:12:31 the pfp 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:12:51 kids love to look older
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:13:18 Mtf is as old as when i signed up for roblox 💀🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:13:55 Mtf i have a nephew and their only access is cocomelon 🤯🤯💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:14:21 My cousins are 10-15 years older than me 💀

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:15:47 Rip servers
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:15:59 would literally die for 3 days over chipotle
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:16:11 Never forget
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:16:36 i mean there arent free burritos rn thankfully so it isnt 3 days
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:16:45 give it 30 mins
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:17:28 Wtf but i could join a server 2 hours ago
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:18:05 i just left because i can't finish the other side of the steering mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:18:29 rlly complex and a pain in the ass to build on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:19:09 
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:19:27 remember that one time it died over chipotle
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:21:06 running on an intel 8086 and 1mb ram 🤯🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:21:27 Bro banned as soon as i joined
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:22:51 
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:23:15 i hate public servers with a passion
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:23:55 Mtf will fly with the ugliest plane known to man while you're building an annoying ass steering mechanisn
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:24:17 o7
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:24:30 I can't even join my ps
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:24:41 o7
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:25:17 
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:32:20 Late
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:32:28 bro left by himself
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:34:09 Lmao what's in it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:39:33 show modlist 😎
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:39:58 Skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:40:14 How tf can you NOT go to the mun
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:40:30 It's literally so huge its soi is massive
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:40:46 why no waterfall 😭😭😭
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:41:38 Mtf how can slipping a finger break your game
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:42:22 Your twr is too big if 1sec of thrust gives you a solar orbit
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:42:45 how big was your orbit
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:43:45 yeah its an orbit
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:43:54 Like seriously wtf was your mun encounter
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:44:10 are you trying to slingshot or not
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:45:12 i call it an orbit even if you have an encounter bc the mun for this example is the only thing changing it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:45:47 I mean if you're going interplanetary just a tap of rcs is enough to ruin a 70km approach
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:46:25 You're actually supposed to not make a straight line
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:47:17 You're not supposed to make a straight line lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:47:41 elliptical orbit that lines up with the mun at apoapsis
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:49:31 7000 dv maneuver 🤯🤯🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:51:07 Rapier?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:51:27 k lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:51:37 2774sec scary
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:52:03 No
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:52:31 i bought ksp on steam even if it was free bc i could never stand epic games launcher
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:55:41 i used to but i bought it bc older versions with mods
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:55:57 Main reason beside i hate epic games
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:56:52 Agree
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:57:18 i uninstalled after 10 hours of screen time 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:57:29 it was actually wasting me time (real)
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:57:35 addiction (real)
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:58:05 Insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:58:18 i want to punch a child so bad its screaming so loudly
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:58:41 Mtf wants mcdonalds but ofc the mom doesnt want to
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:58:56 Raw unfiltered access to the internet is crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:59:29 
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 03:59:49 ill go take a piss
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:06:10 Text blocks don't have any collision right
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:06:25 i should be able to make a better rack and pinion design if so
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:06:48 since the connecting parts are a bit higher which twists the the rack a bit
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:07:11 Wing panels as gears since slabs are too thick
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:07:29 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:07:40 any replacement that's thin enough?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:07:54 my mind literally forgot mb
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:07:58 it should work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:08:24 granular control steering 🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:08:38 tbh i find half blocks too thick
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:08:47 it gets seized up if i try
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:09:04 half wedges (the small ones) are small enough to work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:09:33 damn there's more blocks i forgot
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:10:00 Insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:10:21 but i kinda want the motor having some feedback on a steering wheel kind of thing
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:10:47 probably not
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:34:14 Damn my efforts are useless
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:34:31 Rwd differential and dumbass front steering
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:34:59 Mtf front steering really hard 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:35:35 Wait like actual 4wd driveshaft and everything
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:35:55 So it acts like a limited slip differential
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:37:11 i think the only way i can connect my differential to something else is by using a chain or smth
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:37:42 Lmao how do i drive shaft my diff 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:38:11 I'm not doing gears again oml
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:38:27 angle locking 😭😭
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:38:39 Wait you can link them without using gears
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:38:41 Ong
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:38:53 wouldnt it slip tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:39:37 I tried it and it didnt work like a clutch
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:39:50 max force and everything
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:39:59 literally clipping in the cylinder
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:40:13 Prob doing everything wrong
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:40:31 Insane torque multiplication 🤯🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:41:18 My only issue is that my diff stops sometimes bc a bump makes the diff give all the power to the wheel in the air
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:41:47 diff lock imagine
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:41:58 I could only wish
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:42:53 tbh would i even have any use for diff lock considering how stupid this game is with physics
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:43:26 Wait that's how simple a limited slip diff is?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:43:51 No
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:44:14 Atc?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:44:27 Insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:45:04 Holy cow diff lock?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:45:26 insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:45:37 Like the two axles together?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:45:59 shouldn't have any issues then
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:46:12 a magnet on one side and an ice block so there isnt much slip
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:46:17 friction*
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:46:30 they're actually like 2 blocks wide from how i made it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:46:37 from each axle
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:47:14 my nightmare is somehow making a drive shaft on it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:47:51 angle locking to make it work crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:48:08 im not having 4 teeth gears forever 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:48:33 i mean its really light so wouldnt just a fabric cylinder work tbh
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:50:02 Insane number
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:50:36 Imagine if my proof of concept build gets downvoted because i didn't make it look cool just made sure it works 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:51:25 im doing it because im actually bored
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:51:51 my computer is broken and im only building it as a way to waste time and get mad at my phone 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:51:58 Mf no joystick glitch
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:53:26 Building on mobile making me insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:54:03 if only i could connect my mouse to my phone 😭
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:54:34 I don't have a usbc to usb female adaptor
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:55:21 That's what making me insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:58:11 how to make clutch in plane crazy (its making me insane)
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:58:23 i try with a piston and it doesnt work lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 04:58:48 if roblox comes back ill try to drive shaft my diff
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:02:11 Force is too low prob
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:02:29 More likely not reaching
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:03:09 my idea was wedges that would come in idk
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:03:15 Oh half balls
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:03:25 i thought wedges would work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:08:52 And can disengage easy?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:09:13 Because
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:09:15 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:09:25 🤷‍♂️
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:09:54 but i prefer actually being something mechanical tbh
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:10:08 yeah i meant magnets
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:10:53 im waiting for roblox to go back so i can experimenting linking my diff to a drive shaft
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:11:32 timing macro 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:11:37 i could never
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:11:53 ?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:12:19 🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:13:02 how did the cylinders fire though
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:13:20 what did you use to push them
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:13:51 Wtf
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:14:03 ofc piston moment
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:14:08 really slow
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:14:27 i never knew it was feasible
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:15:10 insanity
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:15:17 inline 8?
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:15:47 wouldn't inline 16 sag like crazy irl
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:15:55 horror
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:17:08 This game is straight up insane
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:17:35 if only we weren't limited by a tiny building area
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:19:06 If a driveshaft could work it opens the door to that possibility ong
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:19:28 Wtf
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:19:47 if they can be made huge then physics whatever
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:20:32 Waiting for roblox to work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:20:51 Ngl i could make a piston engine on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:20:57 autoclicker timing idk
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:21:29 units is tyre diameter right
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:21:57 everything is possible with enough motorlocks 🤯🤯
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:22:17 how
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:23:40 everything is actually possible ong
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:24:16 but pistons cant work opposite
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:24:28 like press to retract whatever
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:24:40 literal piston engine
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:25:52 alr
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:26:12 War thunder economy 🤑🤑🤑
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:26:27 No
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:26:39 You have been in a coma for the past 7 years
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 05:26:49 Wake up
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 07:13:48 Lmao it got stuck 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 07:14:36 Looks like sparklers arent the best gear things
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 07:24:46 Plane crazy players will literally build anything except planes
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 08:40:45 your diff lock idea didnt do shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 08:40:56 literally didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 08:42:41 it's crazy to think that 8yo kids can barely make coherent sentences and one appeared here a few hours ago 💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:01:40 On toggle
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:01:56 show in game example so i can see 🥺
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:02:15 having a block in it connects it so i ise a slab and a piston

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:26:38 Actual real
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:40:35 No
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:41:16 i wanna try making helicopters but no clue where to start
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:41:50 I don't think i can fit a diff inside it
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:42:37 either way it was just a proof of concept and not something that i'll make into anything
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:42:50 just to say "it's possible"
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:43:43 i know the community is raw unfiltered garbage but well at the end of the day my build is just a proof of concept and not something that will be made into anything else
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:44:14 next time i'll redesign the diff to be able to have a driveshaft hooked up to it so i can make a piston engine
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:44:53 i know im getting downvoted but whatever
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:45:07 don't care whatever
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:45:33 gonna try to helicopter for next time wasting whatever
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 12:21:14 i should figure out how to make a decent build ngl
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 12:21:42 500 hours of effort 3 upvotes 90 downvotes 💀
