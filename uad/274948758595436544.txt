general 2021-07-03 07:08:22 understandable
general 2021-07-03 07:10:19 both at the same time, on the same paper
general 2021-07-03 07:15:30 both too long and not long enough
general 2021-07-03 07:15:44 yes.

general 2021-07-03 07:18:59 welp don't think aninals look like red strings so

oh no.
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:49:41 so I'm making a spaceship with helium, would it be better to have the "apply at center" toggle on for the helium blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:51:00 k thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 19:05:41 boate

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:09:29 well they still exist and annoy everyone so
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:10:03 it's worse now, probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:10:44 you can report them for that right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:11:14 yeah that
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:11:27 might as well try idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:12:10 yeah that bot's the definition of useless
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:13:12 yeah that's fucked up
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:23:46 neat, more targets
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:26:26 that'd be nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:15 delayed?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:04 rewrite?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:41 I got to 8000 before <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:29:25 Idk what that means but ok then
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:30:00 ohh ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:30:19 but wasn't he making a second game tho?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:30:35 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:40 what is pcc?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:58 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:36:35 I just solve the turning speed with rocket engines lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:38:09 that'd delete ball shredders lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:39:08 I mean adding G force sounds cool but it wouldn't be as fun
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:39:32 maybe if it was optional or something like that then yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:40:43 how did he  *n o t*  die?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:57:17 3, take it or leave it
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:01:35 ok wtf
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:01:59 *crusade time*
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:02:59 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:07:10 you don't, it makes you
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:10:08 except for wiping out shredders
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:10:44 **me**
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:11:28 why not both
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:12:38 they must've been the slow ones then
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:04 fast omni bugs are a bit harder to hit
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:23 ball shredder
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:48 except they have cutters too
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:14:14 are they another kind and not the ball ones?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:14:56 well bad news if they were separate: they merged
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:16:01 gotta love watching those go kaboom
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:16:58 oof
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:18:04 I won a bunch this month
started like 2 months ago
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:18:46 with shredders, yes. without them, it can be cool at times
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:20:12 they're good against ground actually
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:20:26 for me at least
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:20:50 just aim at the ground below your target and they go kaboom
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:21:25 same
||my builds might have too many guns||
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:22:28 you haven't seen mine
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:23:44 remove the water jets, make it vtol and *very* manouverable with decent speed and you get my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:24:07 noice
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:24:29 k give me a minute
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:30:48 yeah had to turn on my pc, where do I post it btw?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:31:01 k sure

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:06:46 he does have a point
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:07:07 good idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:07:54 more than about a normal player at least
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:08:06 even if just a tiny bit
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:08:51 what does this mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:15:18 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:18:46 chat big ded
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:19:06 n o
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:19:23 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:59:32 why does it look like it used to be longer but got slapped into a third of its original size
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 03:00:25 ohno
general 2021-07-15 03:01:51 just use tanks against them
general 2021-07-15 03:02:29 if you build your tank right they're pretty good against most shredders
general 2021-07-15 03:03:00 yes
general 2021-07-15 03:03:30 yup
general 2021-07-15 03:04:22 what even are those
general 2021-07-15 03:06:36 what is AST?
general 2021-07-15 03:07:09 hold up that's a thing?
general 2021-07-15 03:07:33 is there a way to
j o i n
general 2021-07-15 03:08:25 you founded it while you were asleep and then forgot idk
general 2021-07-15 03:09:08 don't, it's  h e r e s y
general 2021-07-15 03:09:36 because
general 2021-07-15 03:10:27 so is there a way to join that? I pvp mostly to target them so
general 2021-07-15 03:10:49 o
general 2021-07-15 03:11:40 war
war never changes
general 2021-07-15 03:12:24 the shredders?
general 2021-07-15 03:14:31 I mean there's hundreds of servers so chances to find people are usually low
general 2021-07-15 03:19:41 **heresy.**
general 2021-07-15 03:20:30 a bugs a bug
general 2021-07-15 03:21:24 Anti Stonks Team
general 2021-07-15 03:23:53 oh nice
general 2021-07-15 03:24:15 it isn't
general 2021-07-15 03:26:10 glitched engines should stay as they help with shredders but shredders can't use them
general 2021-07-15 03:27:43 why not have a round two so we have more targets
general 2021-07-15 03:28:54 slow
general 2021-07-15 03:29:37 I'd say that's average tbh
general 2021-07-15 03:32:21 cruise missiles usually become useless against fast moving targets even if they actually "hit"
general 2021-07-15 03:33:48 cruise missiles just bounce off or explode early if hitting targets going at 500+ speed
general 2021-07-15 03:33:53 most at least
general 2021-07-15 03:38:12 then remove the wings
general 2021-07-15 03:39:13 w i d e
general 2021-07-15 06:06:49 it's a rat with a tesla coil
general 2021-07-15 06:09:52 could y'all just stop

general 2021-07-15 06:27:57 chaos, probably
general 2021-07-15 06:30:10 there's far more potatoes rn than there have ever been humans
general 2021-07-15 06:30:52 pretty sure it is ngl
general 2021-07-15 06:31:24 how the hell

plane-crazy 2021-07-28 09:50:10 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:36:25 shredder swarms can't do anything to most tanks
unless the tank goes at 20 sps and has 10 degree vision
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:37:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:38:30 add cutters or tnt on it
