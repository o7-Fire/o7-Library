plane-crazy 2020-05-16 08:12:37 SAAB-340 i'm working on
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 08:13:12 I doubt it will fly but it'll look cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 13:59:00 Vulture droid
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 13:59:30 very cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:01:05 I think the I-400 is an engineering masterpiece, do you guys agree?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:04:41 Answer my question
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:34 wait how is it..
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:05:52 is it in build mode or drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:07:11 i will commit terrible crimes
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:20 I am about to say a terrible letter
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:21 E
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:10:53 might build the I-400 submarine
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:11:03 Maybe the Seina planes too?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:11:22 but first i need to work on a torpedo
general 2020-05-26 07:12:36 Random question but in naval warfare the roblox game do you prefer the normal light bomber or the torpedo bomber?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:12:59 The draft
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:07 like a sketch for a painting
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:22 you build the important parts the structure
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:13:39 and if you don't like it you can use it for another thing later on
general 2020-05-26 07:14:39 I prefer torpedo since you don't have to get close to the enemy
general 2020-05-26 07:14:54 Normal bombers are better for dive bombing or attacking islands
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:15:09 wat
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:15:32 I only speak japanese plane

general 2020-05-26 07:20:25 The japanese made a supersonic version of the F4J but the F4J phantom 2 is american

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 07:28:55 nobody knows
general 2020-05-26 07:29:24 It still hit a freighter you dumb dumb
general 2020-05-26 07:29:31 and it only carried recon aircraft

general 2020-05-26 08:03:09 e
general 2020-05-26 08:29:14 Should I try make a torpedo prototype?

general 2020-05-26 10:39:36 I'm going to have to ask you to
general 2020-05-26 10:39:37 stop
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 10:55:13 e
general 2020-05-26 10:57:16 When you realise Air to air missiles are more effective against ships in plane crazy than torpedoes
general 2020-05-26 11:04:04 Imagine building a sub with a working torpedo loading system xd
the-dump 2020-05-26 12:42:57 There goes hawaii
bot-central 2020-05-26 12:53:14 !connect

bot-central 2020-05-26 12:53:43 !p There goes hawaii
general 2020-07-07 00:30:30 I made an F35 with a magnet drive inside
It didn't increase the speed much
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 17:21:50 Disconnectors refuse to works unless they are like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 17:22:08 It's making it a pain to build torpedo bombers

plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:15:53 Ok guys I made the torpedo work
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:15:58 this is good
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:16:25 It's actually prettty effective
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:39:51 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 18:39:53 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:05:20 We need wing panels with fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:05:48 In ww2 they kept fuel in the wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:07:20 I still want fuel tank wing panels
general 2020-07-21 10:20:01 E
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:32 Imma try build a DO-17
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:42 too bad i can't make a triple bladed engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:51 if you try make a triple bladed engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:20:56 the plane withh go backwards
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:21:00 will
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:24:16 I'll make a uhh four prop blade do-17
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:36:16 Guys look a flying pencil
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:41:31 there has got to be an easier way to make this
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:47:38 Madattak and Rikie I take it back half wedge 2's were a great idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:53:09 what think of my DO-17 Night fighter?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:54:20 Pretty sure it's reconniscance
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:55:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:55:37 i am not allowed to say the bad german sign?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:06 I am making that plane but without the bad german sign
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:17 That is why i post blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:56:24 Blueprints don't have signs
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:57:01 Did you know that it was the germans in WW2 that discovered the uses of swept wings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 10:58:56 so far my do-17 is 106 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:01:54 Is it me or was the maximum amount of guns reduced to ten?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:01:59 I swear it used to be twelve
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:02:17 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:03:40 Did you know that towards the end of the pacific war with japan running low on supplies they stopped using hydraulics in tank turrets and the gunners had to use their own bodies to move the turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:05:04 If japan didn't underestimate america before the battle of midway they could of won
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:06:04 Too bad a P-38 shot down the G4M1 bomber that was carrying him
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:07:10 DO-17 night fighter at high altitude vs P-51 at low altitude
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:07:26 DO-17 had radar so it would probably win
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:34 I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:49 But F6F was the first american plane to truly beat the A6M zero
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:08:59 It was also used in the korean war afterwards
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:09:44 Didn't say where it was fitted
the-dump 2020-07-21 11:10:07 Hey hans i think we went over britain
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:10:34 Instead of being called the battle of britain it should be called BOB
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:11:10 "I remember BOB like it was yesterday sunny boy"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:11:21 "I was in my spitfire chasing down some stukas"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:14:33 Pack jets anywhere you can
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:39 Custom ailerons are way better than normal control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:15:55 I'd say set you max angle for the motor 2s for like 45
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:17:31 was that a V1 missile?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:18:18 Ok back to building my do
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:32:53 pew pew
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:35:28 What
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:35:36 I'm still testing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:44:56 Do-17 almost completed in the body part
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 11:46:14 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:01:07 so far my do is 173 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:01:19 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:03:38 turn gravity slider to 300
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:04:02 did you turn it to 300?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:04:16 it's titanic all over again
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:15:56 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:16:02 Imma put the engine son
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:16:15 and hopefully some custom landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:20:45 so far my do is 199 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:20:52 yes
the-dump 2020-07-21 12:21:24 my brain go what
the-dump 2020-07-21 12:22:17 I want to see wide brickzay walk
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 12:39:11 This engine and landing gear was overly complicated
general 2020-07-21 12:52:37 North korea
general 2020-07-21 12:52:40 is the best korea
creations-chat 2020-07-21 13:00:05 Is that a mcdonnal douglas

creations-chat 2020-07-21 13:16:21 What you guys think of my DO-17?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:23:14 
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:43:56 Do you have motors in the back?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:44:04 Because if your torque is too high
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 13:44:08 it's probably that
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:26 Do fuel tanks catch fire when you shoot them or not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:31 Because if not
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:35:41 it would be a nice feature
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 16:38:05 rick? more like

plane-crazy 2020-07-21 19:28:18 e
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:39 do the planes work?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:44 because if not
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:48:51 what is the point of having them
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 21:49:23 but do they fly?
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:32:13 F7F i'm building
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:36:08 thing is
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:36:21 the custom retractable gear is kinda gonna be a pain

plane-crazy 2020-08-15 21:05:22 I hate myself
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 21:05:45 I wish for my existance to cease
general 2020-08-15 21:05:54 Hey
general 2020-08-15 21:06:06 You guys think torque roll on prop planes is annoying?
general 2020-08-15 21:06:31 Do you even know what torque roll is?
general 2020-08-15 21:08:02 Torque roll is like
general 2020-08-15 21:08:07 you know how the propellers spin?
general 2020-08-15 21:08:22 the props try to turn the plane
general 2020-08-15 21:08:40 it's pretty annoying on takeoff and during turns
general 2020-08-15 21:08:49 because you have to push against the roll
general 2020-08-15 21:11:12 well
general 2020-08-15 21:11:23 there is the counter spinning prop
general 2020-08-15 21:11:24 or
general 2020-08-15 21:11:35 you could put a prop on the back
general 2020-08-15 21:12:27 blame rick
general 2020-08-15 21:13:11 because he made the game with madattack
general 2020-08-15 21:13:21 my F7F is attracting babes

general 2020-08-15 21:15:46 no
general 2020-08-15 21:16:07 it's just that women are very rare on plane crazy because most of the player base is males
general 2020-08-15 21:18:00 i am gonna ping myself
general 2020-08-15 21:18:06 watch me do it

plane-crazy 2020-09-21 17:43:16 ME?!?!?
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 17:43:19 k
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 17:43:23 k
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 17:43:24 k
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 17:43:51 whachu mean how?
general 2020-09-21 17:46:06 > rick has planned to add a cannon
<@!265819387498332160>  Like an MG cannon or like a cannon that fires big cannons or and auto cannoN?
general 2020-09-21 17:52:20 I don't think that's how that works
general 2020-09-21 17:53:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:49:53 Give me a ww2 plane to try motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:50:57 Was tryna make a sepecat jaguar
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:51:05 might try motor locking the cockpit instead
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:51:07 because rn
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 22:51:10 it's kinda trash
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:15:14 well first try at motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:15:16 pretty trash
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:15:27 
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:36:01 I'm trash at building tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:36:06 or any type of land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:37:33 I only got the basics of motor lock down today
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:37:46 after I spent 5 hours on youtube and google
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:37:56 currently it's 00;37
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:38:05 I don't need sleep I need motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:38:24 That is probably
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:38:35 more simple than the one I used for my sepecat jaguar's cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:39:10 how come you can build that off a blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:39:21 And I can't even get a single track right?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:02 Put a gyro in
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:32 I saw you just used motors and cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:47 but how do you turn because tanks turn by putting more power into one track
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:53 so
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:53 than the other
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:40:59 how do you turn?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:41:07 The tank behind the slaughter
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:41:21 I'm seeing purple
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:41:24 Then again
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:41:34 I can't really tell dark orange apart from red
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:41:50 motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:43:36 Green
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:43:45 where you get these 3D modelski's
general 2020-10-05 23:44:05 War thunder is fun
general 2020-10-05 23:44:15 but when I get really bored I play heroes and generals WW2
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:44:31 sketch fab huh
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:44:34 never heard of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:46:10 oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:46:12 pretty easy to find
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:49:03 Put a gyro on it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:49:07 it'll help it balance
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:50:52 I could probably remember their at the front
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:51:09 
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:51:12 and one on the top
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 23:51:41 I'm debating wether I should just do the 37mm gun or do the 37mm gun and the two machine guns

plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:11:34 POV: You have come in-between me and fitting a bomb bay into my fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:12:13 I'm not doing a harrier
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:13:12 I was messing around with motorlock yesterday and managed to make a half decent looking cockpit and am now making it into a custom jet
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:13:36 And I am trying to fit a bomb bay in it
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:13:38 but
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:14:03 I made the jet 1 block with a half block on each side
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:14:21 the base is literally one block and it is hurting my brain
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:14:41 because all the motorlock bomb bay designs I have thought of were too big
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:14:52 I got close with one but on the the locks didn't work
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:15:13 well one of the locks word
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:15:15 worked
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 14:17:03 why?

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:48:27 wish me luck because my brain might genuinely catch fire
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:49:48 so do I like angle lock wing panels into the half blocks or is it just half blocks?

plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:29:47 like
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:29:49 a flying wing?
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:29:58 because i'm pretty sure
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:30:07 you need a vertical stabilizer for smooth flying
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:39:40 most planes do
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:39:45 apart from things  like
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:39:49 the spirit bomber
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:39:52 and the Horton thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:39:55 flying wing
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:40:03 and some others too
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 13:49:17 Hansa Brandenburg w.12 nearing le completion
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 14:02:42 It flies!
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 14:30:12 it works

plane-crazy 2021-12-05 15:17:06 i don't get why people go mad over exposed motorlock like 9 times out of 10 it's one motor sticking out
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 15:17:09 i don't get it
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 15:20:32 give this man inventor role x10
creations-chat 2021-12-05 15:22:48 that isn't very good feedback but from what i'm seeing there are a bit too many guns and the guns themselves aren't the best looking also the hull is all around pretty blocky but I don't build ships so y'know

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:28:22 use a normal motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:28:25 with cameras as like
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 13:28:32 a stopper for the tail
