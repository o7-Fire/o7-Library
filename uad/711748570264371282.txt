bug-reports 2020-12-01 21:44:46 Yes that happens to me all the time even if my friend leaves the game then rejons he wil sometimes still be blacklisted
general 2020-12-03 00:21:18 ok ik this is going to sound stupid, but how do you get the donator chat tag?
general 2020-12-03 00:21:43 via buying tip jar?
general 2020-12-03 00:22:17 i did that in game
general 2020-12-03 00:22:25 the tip jar
general 2020-12-03 00:22:46 ooooooooooh
general 2020-12-03 00:22:50 im dumb
general 2020-12-03 00:25:10 they should add a 80 robux donation option :/
general 2020-12-03 00:25:44 yessss
general 2020-12-03 00:26:00 but them poeple might just do 1
general 2020-12-03 00:26:21 then people who do 100 would get frustrated
general 2020-12-03 00:27:19 so I do understand the minimum amount but it should be 80 so the donation amount isn't uneven from robux purchase limit amounts
general 2020-12-04 00:31:54 Roblox: we are having some issues
general 2020-12-04 00:32:54 Roblox: we are having some issues Me after finally getting all my work done to get on: <:Bruh:589676002221883403>
