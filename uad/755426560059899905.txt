plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:00:40 ryt thank you
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:01:08 isnt he used to that
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:01:22 EVERY GAME HAS TOXICITY IN IT
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:01:27 even the league
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:01:36 no matter how small or big it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:02:29 but actually the bigger the game is the more toxic it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:03:05 one solution
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:03:08 ROCKETS
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:03:33 yea
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:04:02 then use conveyor engines and set it to low speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:06:19 i wish there was a config for disconnectors where you can set how many times you have to press the hotkey before it disconnects
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:06:29 it'll be VERY useful
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:06:40 for bombers and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:06:56 u just have to spam the hotkey and go crazy with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:06:59 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:07:06 ill suggest it after i get my rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:07:11 hopefully i get it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:07:22 i worked hard for that vtol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:09:21 for example you can set the disconnector after you have pressed the hotkey three times, the other one two times, and the other one just one time
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:09:30 three bombs dropped in one hotkey

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:40:58 what does damping do in the suspension??
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:41:44 i think we should have an inquiry channel
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:42:16 and pros will have a certain role so they will have to answer and ecplain some of the questions
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:42:33 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:44:10 i know now
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:44:45 so no need for any further roasting.....just thinking in advance because i know someone will
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:45:35 suspensions to vibrate sideways..... the higher the damping the lesser the vibration
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:45:42 i observed it
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 00:48:53 ryt srry im high

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:16:56 erm no
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:17:41 as you can see a robloxian is smol so 1 meter is 4 studs for them
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:17:51 speed of sound is 300 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:18:12 so in roblox speed of sound is 1200 sps
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:18:49 i came to nearly mach 2 here :D
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:19:09 1 meter for a robloxian is 4 studs
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:19:19 so lets measure speed of light
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:20:01 1199169832 sps
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:20:07 thats a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:21:29 46611731369 sps is warp 3
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:21:39 thats heccin fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:22:04 i wanna get to this speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:22:27 proof pls
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:23:17 but i believe it wouldnt be shown as a full number in the speed meter
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:23:27 it would be something like 123123e234
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:23:31 smthn like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:24:09 but you have already reached the end of the map before reaching that full speed

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 01:59:28 oh uhhh not really required to bully him or anything unless hes bragging about those builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:00:11 if he says its his best then respect him cuz for HIM its his best
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:00:25 we all have our own perspectives towards our own builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:01:19 oh yeah uhh i guess just roast him all you want
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:02:06 can fabric wing panels really add stability?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:02:32 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:02:52 hmm what can be done to stabilize small builds aside from a decent pc
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:03:06 ive seen someone do such thing before
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:03:45 mine doesnt really do that but yeah physics gets weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:05:43 OHHH I GET IT
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:05:53 delta wing 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:06:01 it reduces turbulence
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:06:09 makes it more streamlined
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:19 noice
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:35 more streamlined = more stable at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:09:04 never use quadrilateral shaped wings for fast planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:17:49 what.... more stable = less maneuverable? :(
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:18:42 i meade mine stable but agility is gone
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:18:48 i cant do the cobra anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:21:14 wait lemme record
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:26:40 wait... i cant find the file :)
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:29:53 but here lemme explain
 
first you got to have hover drive set to zero drag and max speed second go in a straight level flight on your max speed preferably 1200 sps next lower your throttle until it reaches somewhere between 750 to 800 but lower the better.. once you reach that speed pull your nose up to approx. 89 to 91.35 degrees.. as you reach that angle after sometime increase to max throttle to gain back energy and push down hard on the pitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:32:40 just remember that this will all happen very fast so you have to be accurate at doing each step
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:33:56 but if you want something easier just put a conveyor drive that pushes down the rear of your aircraft :D
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:34:17 nope not me

[Gameplay]
[Clouds]

nothing much to say about this also not expecting to be added in the current plane crazy game; clouds will be a cool addition to the plane crazy map and make it more interesting and a bit more realistic lets say when digfighting or just peacefully flying in some altitudes...... it can be just thin sheets of white smoke thingies... or can be clumps (poop clouds :D )... players can also toggle it of in the settings GUI

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 07:59:11 check my suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 07:59:23 nop
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 07:59:32 its cooler
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 07:59:59 [Motor 3][Configurable]

based on past suggestions, a motor three will follow a place in a terrain or a build you click on....
but there will be a few notes and limitations:
: motor threes will have a maximum angle of 180 degrees and never higher
: they will have imaginary tracking cones with the angle based on the angle set by the player (more on that later)
: they will only have a default speed of 1.5 so it won't be so overpowered
: they will also have a default hotkey for "reset target" and one hotkey must apply to all motor threes for they cannot have individual reset hotkeys
: about targeting ang the tracking cone we will have a few things to point out :D
-when targeting let's say a build a green little "x" will highlight that specific block on the build and once clicked or selected it will turn red and once inside the tracking cone the red "x" will start blinking indicating the lock
(when target is not inside the tracking cone, it will be selected as target but can't be tracked by the motor 3)
- similar to when targeting a block.. when targeting a part of the terrain it works the same way but instead of an "x" it shows a green circle, red circle and a red blinking circle
: to be able to warn the players about the locked on motor three. once a block on their build is heing locked on.. there will show a warning sing on their screen blinking and also a beeping sound that goes faster and higher in pitch as the motor threes go near
- when locked on the locked on motor threes will be highlited as green squares which can be clicked so the players can select as targets (it will work the same way "red squares and blinking red squares") but the green squares never disappear unless it lost its lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:02:38 pls support motor three

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:05:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:05:36 also my motor three idea isnt that op
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:05:44 its a bit slow
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:05:54 so you can outturn it

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:12:01 just go behind it
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:12:48 what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:13:06 players cant adjust its speed anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:13:20 it will be default 1.5
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:13:23 speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:14:17 then destroy the motor three
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:14:28 :D
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:15:36 you can put the radar on that motor

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:18:39 motor three wont be op since it cant target the lead angle
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:19:26 yes it will if you get too close.... being too close increases the chance if loosing your lock

- when locked on the locked on motor threes will be highlited as green squares which can be clicked so the players can select as targets (it will work the same way "red squares and blinking red squares") but the green squares never disappear unless it lost its lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:44:33 here
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:45:51 it will be the same since you could just put the radar onto a turret connected to the radar
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:46:38 im saying it because basically our ideas are just the same
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:47:11 same with the motor three
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:47:19 it turns slow
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:47:40 and can't do a 360
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:49:50 also
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:49:58 motor three can target terrain
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:51:53 WTF
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 08:52:24 who summoned Lucifer??

plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:02:40 just buy intel core i7 and that should work
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:02:57 i7 is good enough
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:03:14 :O
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:03:17 TELL ME
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:03:31 oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:03:32 well
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:03:50 weird aerodynamic configuration will cause wobbles and wobbles will cause fps drops
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:04:12 up
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:04:40 just fix aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:04:43 balance it
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:04:56 if it needs its CoG to be forwards do it
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:03 if it needs to be at the back
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:10 balance it to be like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:15 thats what i do to my builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:22 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:29 make it close to the middle
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:40 only use wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:46 never focus on weight because you are just working with aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:05:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:06:21 oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:06:32 screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:06:35 on build mode
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:07:41 add wing in the nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:07:53 to pull CoL in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:08:17 <@!593249332262600725>
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:08:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:08:46 place wings in the front until the CoG and CoL is balanced
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:09:12 because unbalanced CoL and CoG kinda messes up with the physics at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:09:39 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:09:51 how many blocks does ur build have??
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:09:59 <@!593249332262600725>
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:10:16 whazzat
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:10:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:10:44 you can still balance that
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:10:51 my builds go at 1200
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:10:55 and has 700 blocs
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:11:07 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:11:32 screen shot CoL and CoG??
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:11:36 so i can see
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:09 more wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:12 in front
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:26 thatll mess you up
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:47 its decent
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:55 never focus on the weight
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:12:58 focus on the lift
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:13:04 because flight has little to do with it
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 04:14:57 nouice

general 2023-01-26 13:06:04 I've been inactive for this server for SO long
general 2023-01-26 13:06:08 how do i suggest
general 2023-01-26 13:06:36 neat
bot-central 2023-01-26 13:10:15 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:33:32 wait really damn
general 2023-02-09 15:54:05 ohhh, is it because of limitations in the game engine itself?
general 2023-02-09 15:55:06 nah I'm suggesting that for a pc2 feature though
general 2023-02-09 15:56:47 when you're underwater, the game uses a shader to apply the underwater effect right?, what if when inside a submarine; yes the water column wont disappear but the "water shader thingy" won't apply, 

ahh darn it i dunno much about the technical stuff lol
general 2023-02-09 16:00:55 damnn very cool
general 2023-02-09 16:01:12 or he could also do it in a a very lazy way... just stop the water from rendering for a player when inside a submerged creation, <:trollface:775024642104229898>
