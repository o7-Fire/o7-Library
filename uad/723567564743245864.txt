The Tale of whittay (723567564743245864)
general 2021-04-26 16:12:16 you know you can get inventor rank on this discord server and yet chances are you will still not understand women
general 2021-04-26 16:12:38 exactly cuz its too high up of brain
general 2021-04-26 16:12:55 to get inventor u need to be big brain
general 2021-04-26 16:13:11 so even if ur big brain u still wouldnt understand women
general 2021-04-26 16:13:14 they confuzing
general 2021-04-26 16:13:29 yes u have to be RLLY IMPRESSIVE to get inventor
general 2021-04-26 16:13:36 so impressive that they notice YOU
general 2021-04-26 16:13:47 its possible just hard
general 2021-04-26 16:13:55 and unlikely
general 2021-04-26 16:14:26 you would have to invent something so unseen cool and out of this world so they would give it to u
general 2021-04-26 16:14:30 thats what i mean
general 2021-04-26 16:15:23 you cant just ask u need something nobody has seen something that would impress the unimpressables something so obscene that they would break the rules and give it to u
general 2021-04-26 16:15:53 unless u got that then its impossible
general 2021-04-26 16:16:03 wich im guessing we all dont
general 2021-04-26 16:17:17 i wish he added like an option to make something "glitched" and "unglitched" so like u could make a working turret with a lot of blocks and it would work easily
general 2021-04-26 16:17:41 <@!489806344388345857> i am trying to say u need something so impressive its better than anything inventors have done
general 2021-04-26 16:18:08 so like u could have glitched mode for locking and stuff and unglitched for like wheels ect
general 2021-04-26 16:18:25 thats why u need something that outweighs all of there work
general 2021-04-26 16:18:36 wich frankly is so hard its olmost impossible
general 2021-04-26 16:19:17 no but like if u want cylinder wheels and motor turning ect than usuually it glitches out so make a mode whare it dont
general 2021-04-26 16:20:04 if i was devving plane crazy i would add bosses so like starfox whare u can fight huge bosses in a tank or jet or something
general 2021-04-26 16:21:05 like basically pvp mode and a boss shooting simulator had a baby and they put that in plane crazy thats what i would do
general 2021-04-26 16:21:42 N o I c E
general 2021-04-26 16:22:34 i only build stuff that is incredibly unpopular and not many ppl will have thaught of i mean its not too impressive but my stuff is unique
general 2021-04-26 16:23:10 what did u invent to get urself invent rank?
general 2021-04-26 16:23:55 it is its just u would need something so impressive you can just say its impossible
general 2021-04-26 16:24:52 admiral it is possible u just would need something better than all the inventor ranked men combined could make
general 2021-04-26 16:25:13 so in other words its impossible
general 2021-04-26 16:25:50 admiral chill jees it is possible the reason they stopped is cuz too many ppl were applying and not enough were valid enough
general 2021-04-26 16:26:59 why are like 1/10 of all the "high ranked ppl" looking at nsfw LOL
general 2021-04-26 16:28:21 what if i made ur mom she is too large to fit inside a plot so what if i did it anyway <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2021-04-26 16:28:51 u down bad?
general 2021-04-26 16:31:18 when u see a shredder swarm coming for your oversized build "(oh for #### sake not again)"
general 2021-04-26 16:31:50 imagine amogus
general 2021-04-26 16:32:18 i skipped the rules and i know a lot of sservers that are fannies about swearing so i decided not
general 2021-04-26 16:34:17 i wonder if anyone has made a baby in plane crazy then made a machine to kick it
general 2021-04-26 16:34:40 lol
general 2021-04-26 16:35:06 lol
general 2021-04-26 16:35:11 LOL
