general 2022-03-25 06:55:24 no i'll probably just make my spitfire worse doing that
general 2022-03-25 06:56:38 cuz i suck at building planes
general 2022-03-25 07:00:28 For those who still wonder why they can't post image's

Q: How do I get a rank?
A: A list of available ranks are available in ranks. Simply build a creation that meets the requirements of at least 1 rank listed there and request for that rank using rank-request. Make sure that you prepare necessary screenshots and block counts before making a request.

Q: Why can't I post images/videos?
A: You will need to obtain a chat level of at least 3 to post media. You can check your current chat level by using the command !rank in bot-central. Note that for general, you require an Expert rank or higher for media permissions (see ranks).

general 2022-03-25 07:05:57 Q: How do I get a rank?
A: A list of available ranks are available in ranks. Simply build a creation that meets the requirements of at least 1 rank listed there and request for that rank using rank-request. Make sure that you prepare necessary screenshots and block counts before making a request.

Q: Why can't I post images/videos?
A: You will need to obtain a chat level of at least 3 to post media. You can check your current chat level by using the command !rank in bot-central. Note that for general, you require an Expert rank or higher for media permissions (see ranks).
