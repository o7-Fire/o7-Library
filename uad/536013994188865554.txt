the-dump 2020-10-14 11:08:53 > You are a repost
true
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:18:50 ranking should be good builds only
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:19:00 no low effort builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:19:40 why
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:19:59 the designer ranks and the expert ranks already are
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:21:16 in my eyes that ship is not worthy of a rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:22:27 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:24:43 most of the builds I have posted in creations are worthy of ranks
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:26:05 I would say this is good or decent (my build in creations btw)
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:27:41 what would you rate this lads?
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:28:16 > 0/10
new record
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:29:08 no it's not a build
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:30:04 yeah because they aren't really big or detailed
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:30:38 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:31:41 it really isn't the best pixel art i've done
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:31:57 it was more of a proof of concept
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:37:11 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:38:03 yeah it is your server
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:38:13 because ladders are fine in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:42:03 this is my actual best pixel art so far
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:47:53 less blocks but bigger than the mario world one
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:48:05 it got almost 50 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:51:41 from thunder force 4
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:52:27 yes

the-dump 2020-10-14 12:57:23 seems accurate

the-dump 2020-10-14 13:02:28 best part is that the plane couldn't even take off
the-dump 2020-10-14 13:02:45 which makes it even more accurate
general 2020-10-14 13:04:13 when iphone 12 looks the same as iphone 11

general 2020-10-14 13:09:57 well in my opinion
general 2020-10-14 13:10:49 the big selling point of android to me is the emulators

plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:04:05 keyboard broken?

plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:05:36 membrane or mechanical?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:13:26 fix it
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:13:32 open it up
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:13:41 is it mechanical or membrane?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:14:38 if it's a laptop use an old external keyboard if you have one
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:15:52 there
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:16:04 what is the actual problem?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:16:44 might be an issue with the laptop keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:17:02 if that's the case a pc repair shop will fix it
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:17:48 keys look fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:18:28 the issue might be with the keyboard module
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:18:46 i'm saying the actual keycaps are fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:19:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:19:13 does the screen work?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:19:26 ok, that's good
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:19:43 it might be an issue with the keyboard itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 10:20:01 let's move this to <#497142796961054721>
general 2020-10-17 10:21:34 <@456226577798135808> your local pc repair shop (if you have one) will fix it, if you don't have one near you then send the laptop to the manufacturer
general 2020-10-17 10:23:46 if you have enough money or if you are not satisfied with your current laptop's performance, then buy a new laptop
general 2020-10-17 10:23:50 or a pc
general 2020-10-17 10:24:51 are you trying to repair the laptop yourself?
general 2020-10-17 10:25:55 if the screen and crap works, then the motherboard is probably fine
general 2020-10-17 10:26:38 the motherboard?
general 2020-10-17 10:27:15 no
general 2020-10-17 10:27:50 send picture of inside

general 2020-10-17 10:34:48 look around for laptops that fit your budget
general 2020-10-17 10:35:11 compare the specs

general 2020-11-14 06:44:55 <@!720751430595772418>  told me to do it lmao
general 2020-11-14 06:46:00 yes
general 2020-11-14 07:42:35 yeah why
general 2020-11-14 07:43:16 just uninstall it if you're done with it
general 2020-11-14 09:07:38 unused sounds in virtua racing arcade
general 2020-11-14 09:08:42 lmao
general 2020-11-14 09:09:55 no wonder nobody ripped the sounds of virtua racing
general 2020-11-14 09:10:03 there's like 100 of them
general 2020-11-14 09:10:35 and many of them are just copies of the music tracks
general 2020-11-14 09:11:04 i've heard the first "time extend" theme around 5 times
general 2020-11-14 09:11:52 interesting
general 2020-11-14 09:12:09 they kept all sounds for all versions on the 1 board
general 2020-11-14 09:17:53 have to use this with command prompt
general 2020-11-14 09:18:24 took me 20 years to figure out how to switch directory again
general 2020-11-14 09:18:28 yeah
general 2020-11-14 09:18:33 and an md port
general 2020-11-14 09:18:39 and a ps2 port
general 2020-11-14 09:18:46 and a saturn port
general 2020-11-14 09:18:51 and a switch port
general 2020-11-14 09:19:31 yeah it does
general 2020-11-14 09:19:38 but this is the arcade version
general 2020-11-14 09:19:46 with the multiPCM music
general 2020-11-14 09:19:50 best music
general 2020-11-14 09:19:56 I do use mame
general 2020-11-14 09:20:26 for virtua racing, virtua formula, and hyperduel
general 2020-11-14 09:20:56 arcade or nothing for me
general 2020-11-14 09:21:15 if it has the arcade version I choose to play it over home ports
general 2020-11-14 09:21:37 I literally have not set up my mame
general 2020-11-14 09:21:45 just got the games and run them
general 2020-11-14 09:22:01 no art or anything
general 2020-11-14 09:22:21 virtua racing was a pain to get running
general 2020-11-14 09:22:36 it was missing various bin files
general 2020-11-14 09:22:49 and had to transplant some from star wars arcade
general 2020-11-14 09:23:18 need to get wingwar running someday
general 2020-11-14 09:23:28 but it's missing bin files again
general 2020-11-14 09:23:50 this only happens with model 1 stuff
general 2020-11-14 09:23:58 hyperduel works fine
general 2020-11-14 09:24:01 first try
general 2020-11-14 09:25:05 I have seperate emulators
general 2020-11-14 09:25:08 
general 2020-11-14 09:25:53 
general 2020-11-14 09:25:59 for every system
general 2020-11-14 09:28:23 I just throw them in the folder lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:29:49 why did you put this in plane crazy channel
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:30:34 that's my favourite thing about plane crazy lol
general 2020-11-14 09:36:44 but I found unused sfx in virtua racing
general 2020-11-14 09:37:34 a clip of mitsuyoshi yelling "virtua racing"
general 2020-11-14 09:52:14 for some reason I can't get m1 to log a wav file
general 2020-11-14 09:56:21 cabbage pancake
general 2020-11-14 10:12:29 lmao
general 2020-11-14 10:13:30 help lads
general 2020-11-14 10:14:03 I need to rip sfx for virtua racing arcade, but it's not in the sound test
general 2020-11-14 10:15:25 that's zoom for you
general 2020-11-14 10:15:31 ms teams is worse
general 2020-11-14 10:15:45 it uses so much ram
general 2020-11-14 10:15:51 the program is better
general 2020-11-14 10:16:08 but the amount of ram it uses is ludicrous
general 2020-11-14 10:16:15 not as much as google chrome
general 2020-11-14 10:16:22 but more than zoom
general 2020-11-14 10:16:40 I have used both
general 2020-11-14 10:16:55 yeah ms teams is secure
general 2020-11-14 10:17:18 because it's from microsoft, not an unknown company
general 2020-11-14 10:17:38 that nobody has heard of before zoom
general 2020-11-14 10:17:44 gang shit
general 2020-11-14 10:19:09 zoom vs ms teams
general 2020-11-14 10:19:25 don't ask about the autoclicker
general 2020-11-14 10:19:56 I use it for simulator games when my brother forces me to play them
general 2020-11-14 10:20:08 mark of the devil
general 2020-11-14 10:20:14 must uninstall
general 2020-11-14 10:20:34 lol
general 2020-11-14 10:20:37 imagine
general 2020-11-14 10:20:44 > i mean i have Canon Scan Utility open at all times for no reason so yes
<@!251880826386513924> why lol
general 2020-11-14 10:21:10 infact teams is using more ram than MAME
general 2020-11-14 10:21:15 an emulator
general 2020-11-14 10:21:22 for arcade games
general 2020-11-14 10:21:38 what is it
general 2020-11-14 10:22:11 what is the build supposed to be
general 2020-11-14 10:22:18 oh
general 2020-11-14 10:22:33 looks a bit square
general 2020-11-14 10:23:24 can't because they're unranked
general 2020-11-14 10:23:59 <#609442446249820211> <#705941616199991307>
general 2020-11-14 10:24:19 none of them
general 2020-11-14 10:25:01 is that supposed to be the tripod from war of the worlds?
general 2020-11-14 10:25:28 because it looks a bit square
general 2020-11-14 10:25:35 yours does
general 2020-11-14 10:27:10 same
general 2020-11-14 10:28:15 why
general 2020-11-14 10:28:54 reptile do you know anything about ripping model 1 arcade sfx?
general 2020-11-14 10:29:24 oh ok
general 2020-11-14 10:29:39 because there's an unused sound effect in virtua racing
general 2020-11-14 10:29:46 not in sound test
general 2020-11-14 10:30:49 looks crap tbh
general 2020-11-14 10:31:27 same as the tripod
general 2020-11-14 10:31:38 the tripod looks crap too
general 2020-11-14 10:31:42 it's square
general 2020-11-14 10:32:37 no this one
general 2020-11-14 10:33:25 proportions are really off
general 2020-11-14 10:35:05 I once played on a daytona usa 8-player special cabinet
general 2020-11-14 10:35:17 with moving seats
general 2020-11-14 10:36:21 I actually prefer virtua racing to daytona usa
general 2020-11-14 10:36:52 even my first proper build looks better than that tripod
general 2020-11-14 10:37:00 and it's really shitty
general 2020-11-14 10:37:15 by my standard at least
general 2020-11-14 10:38:34 I asked ssnc about ripping the sfx
general 2020-11-14 10:38:53 that ecto-1 actually looks decent
general 2020-11-14 10:39:11 I presume it's the ghostbusters 2 version
general 2020-11-14 10:40:29 I just intimidate undes with motor lock
general 2020-11-14 10:41:02 yes
general 2020-11-14 10:41:14 0g thunder force ship
general 2020-11-14 10:43:29 still can't believe rick showed my build and a couple others in order to fix motor lock
general 2020-11-14 10:43:44 yeah
general 2020-11-14 10:44:04 no in discord
general 2020-11-14 10:44:16 and my pixel art on devforum

general 2020-11-14 10:49:15 this
general 2020-11-14 10:55:22 I just realised that the accelerate sound effect might actually be a sample
general 2020-11-14 11:06:57 just you
general 2020-11-14 11:28:24 I have concluded that the acceleration sound in virtua racing arcade is a sample
general 2020-11-14 11:28:43 because it isn't in the sound test
general 2020-11-14 11:28:58 and the pitch is constantly changing
general 2020-11-14 11:38:33 honestly it's running smoothly without mods
general 2020-11-14 11:38:44 i'm suprised
general 2020-11-14 11:38:53 no
general 2020-11-14 11:38:55 please no
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:41:08 and when you can fix all that, then you can fix a bike
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:45:24 garfielf kart
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:45:38 one of my friends actually bought the game on steam for no reason
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:45:47 and it sucked lol
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:46:19 yeah it's amazing
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:46:49 very good racing game
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:48:07 you can call out the tutorial users for using tutorials and claiming them as their own build
the-dump 2020-11-14 11:48:24 that's the strat
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:48:49 and see their reactions when they get exposed
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:49:13 yeah imagine
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:49:34 I used to use them to learn about the game, but never claimed them as my own
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:50:07 already deleted them but it helped me get used to the controls and menus
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:51:03 and I once saw a blueblox x-wing painted a stock colour and he tried to say it's his own
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:51:25 he begged me to go in the x-wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:51:49 and when I called him out he just said "never heard of that guy"
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:07 I did
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:12 and they still begged
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:27 and someone begged me for money once
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:35 because I had donator tag
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:48 yeah I just left
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:53:20 but I can't believe someone would just beg me for money lol

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:59:11 lucky most of my things are pixel arts
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:59:22 or they have sealed cockpits
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:20 it's sealed by design lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:49 because there is no explanation of how the cockpit opens in thunder force lore
the-dump 2020-11-14 12:01:28 backgroud music ruins it

general 2021-01-20 05:30:35 never
general 2021-01-20 05:30:43 here's why:
general 2021-01-20 13:41:46 no it’s alive
general 2021-01-20 13:41:57 a bit
general 2021-01-20 13:42:24 the og server was made when the gaymer stuff was happening
general 2021-01-20 13:42:38 yeah
general 2021-01-20 13:44:15 it’s not pcaua
general 2021-01-20 13:46:33 seems like I have to reinstall windows on my external drive
general 2021-01-20 13:47:02 because my main windows 10 broke the external one
general 2021-01-20 13:47:33 diskcheck
general 2021-01-20 13:47:49 “fixed” stuff on my external drive
general 2021-01-20 13:48:04 which basically destroyed windows startup files
general 2021-01-20 13:50:00 so basically it gets stuck on the loading screen
general 2021-01-20 13:50:27 it attempts to boot but it’s in a loop
general 2021-01-20 13:50:33 windows 10
general 2021-01-20 13:50:40 broke my other windows 10
general 2021-01-20 13:50:46 no joke
general 2021-01-20 13:52:05 I can’t even get files off it because whenever I try to go in the drive it says “access is denied”
general 2021-01-20 13:52:56 not that big of a deal because most of the things are copied from my main
general 2021-01-20 13:53:37 except trackmania and other misc things
general 2021-01-20 13:54:01 nice
general 2021-01-20 13:54:42 I at least want to get the files off of it
general 2021-01-20 13:54:53 but it doesn’t let me
general 2021-01-20 13:56:05 because I have more mame stuff and vgm’s on there
general 2021-01-20 13:56:23 and md stuff
general 2021-01-20 14:00:57 this message is what I get when I try to get files off of it
general 2021-01-20 14:01:29 I think it has something to do with perms
general 2021-01-20 14:01:49 might edit them tomorrow
general 2021-01-20 14:01:58 because it’s very late

bot-central 2021-02-16 10:48:11 !servers
general 2021-02-16 11:23:04 the reconstruction starts
general 2021-02-16 11:43:37 i did all this work reconstructing the map just to find out i have the wrong tileset
general 2021-02-16 11:44:22 so i have to resave the .scr files with the right tileset
general 2021-02-16 11:44:27 and put them back
the-dump 2021-02-16 12:06:44 GUAYANDO 😎  👊
general 2021-02-16 13:31:24 snes flight assets
general 2021-02-16 13:31:38 before dragonfly? (pilotwings)
general 2021-02-16 13:58:02 holy shit
general 2021-02-16 13:58:16 I found something from the 1988 demo of dragonfly
general 2021-02-16 14:02:28 these arrows
general 2021-02-16 14:02:35 found in the test map
general 2021-02-16 14:02:42 ofc different gfx
general 2021-02-16 14:03:02 they are found nowhere else in the game
general 2021-02-16 14:03:11 not even on the test map
general 2021-02-16 14:03:31 it’s a development testing map
general 2021-02-16 14:03:49 
general 2021-02-16 14:04:04 don’t mind the message in the middle
general 2021-02-16 14:04:25 and the runway gfx are the same
general 2021-02-16 14:04:29 yes
general 2021-02-16 14:04:58 the side of the runway was flipped to the other side though
general 2021-02-16 14:05:49 if I flip my screenshot around the numbers on the runway are very similar
general 2021-02-16 14:06:16 this is insane
general 2021-02-16 14:06:28 because this was from the first snes demo
general 2021-02-16 14:06:45 in 1988
general 2021-02-16 14:08:03 https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html great info about the first snes demo
general 2021-02-16 14:10:42 might as well just go through other prototype pilotwings stuff
general 2021-02-16 14:11:51 this is the “dragonfly” from the 1989 demo
general 2021-02-16 14:12:34 as seen in this screenshot
general 2021-02-16 14:12:48 the hud is also in the leak
general 2021-02-16 14:13:02 but I didn’t take a screenshot of it
general 2021-02-16 14:14:28 boss.cgx, not seen in any screenshots. not even sure if it’s the right colour lol
general 2021-02-16 14:16:45 earliest found pilotwings plane
general 2021-02-16 14:18:19 a bit later than the last one
general 2021-02-16 14:18:36 no
general 2021-02-16 14:18:41 I found them
general 2021-02-16 14:18:45 in the leak
general 2021-02-16 14:19:56 you can tell this one is early because it has sprites for going up
general 2021-02-16 14:20:31 in the final the plane never has sprites for going up
general 2021-02-16 14:24:18 if you look close enough you can see the plane going down in this screenshot, just like on the spritesheet
general 2021-02-16 14:30:24 just realised that the going down sprite is really similar to the one in the screenshot
general 2021-02-16 14:30:48 might have to take a look at the palette tomorrow
general 2021-02-16 21:48:55 lol no
general 2021-02-16 22:38:13 idk
general 2021-02-16 22:38:19 he left ni as well

general 2021-02-16 22:39:39 got banned
general 2021-02-16 23:10:24 somebody made a mockup of this screenshot here using assets from the leak
general 2021-02-16 23:11:19 looks way better ofc
general 2021-02-16 23:50:36 holy shit
general 2021-02-16 23:50:43 i found more dragonfly stuff
general 2021-02-16 23:50:56 pilotwings
general 2021-02-16 23:51:06 prototype graphics
general 2021-02-17 00:19:47 probably the oldest surviving snes asset, the logo used in the rotation demo seen in the first snes demonstration
general 2021-02-17 00:30:11 i found it
general 2021-02-17 00:30:37 that title screen background
general 2021-02-17 00:30:50 because data loss
general 2021-02-17 00:30:57 and preservation
general 2021-02-17 00:32:21 hold on there was this txt file of all the stuff that couldn't be backed up
general 2021-02-17 00:44:48 this is part of a log file of all the NeWS backups, many of them failed
general 2021-02-17 00:45:29 so the stuff that survived is important
general 2021-02-17 00:49:07 out of the 41 NeWS workstations, only 7 were backed up successfully
general 2021-02-17 00:49:16 and only 5 of them have stuff
general 2021-02-17 00:52:06 vilde you made the incredible amogus shirt
general 2021-02-17 00:52:15 10/10
general 2021-02-17 01:00:18 these assets are cool, but there's no prototype build in the NeWS backups
general 2021-02-17 04:03:32 what is this slowmode

general 2021-02-21 05:02:22 there are some differences
general 2021-02-21 05:04:31 the earlier one has simplistic shading on the pilotwings logo
general 2021-02-21 05:20:32 oh

general 2021-03-26 08:50:16 there's fzero source code in the 1st gigaleak but there's no assets
general 2021-03-26 08:50:23 so basically useless
general 2021-03-26 08:50:37 nice
general 2021-03-26 08:52:29 if anyone wants to see the info from the fzero source code, here you go
general 2021-03-26 09:00:05 looks like link to the past source code, i can tell because of the mode 7 graphics (smap.CH7)
general 2021-03-26 09:17:35 ok yeah this is definitely link to the past
general 2021-03-26 09:20:32 interesting
general 2021-03-26 09:27:16 i think this is a mix of starfox and prototype stunt race fx source code
general 2021-03-26 09:28:11 well this explains it
general 2021-03-26 09:28:17 prototype star fox
general 2021-03-26 09:28:29 when it was still called starglider
general 2021-03-26 09:29:53 i have to see if this is from the starfox state
general 2021-03-26 09:30:00 or the starglider state
general 2021-03-26 09:34:12 so it's from when it was starfox
general 2021-03-26 09:34:29 couldn't find right palette lol

bot-central 2021-03-27 07:43:02 !servers
general 2021-03-27 07:43:39 i found something cursed today
general 2021-03-27 07:43:56 super metroid and a link to the past randomizer
general 2021-03-27 07:44:00 in one
general 2021-03-27 07:46:06 no joke
general 2021-03-27 07:46:27 you collect the items between games
general 2021-03-27 07:47:30 you go through special doors and the game switches
general 2021-03-27 07:47:34 it's so weird
general 2021-03-27 08:49:35 is there a way i can fix headers of xwd files?
general 2021-03-27 08:50:00 there's a bunch of them from 1995 and only 1 works
general 2021-03-27 08:53:51 i'll try transplanting the header from the working one because idk how xwd files work
general 2021-03-27 08:55:24 this is the working one btw
general 2021-03-27 09:10:19 pretty sure i found the right cgx file for map2
general 2021-03-27 09:10:35 construction starting
general 2021-03-27 09:11:54 no way
general 2021-03-27 09:11:58 no fucking way
general 2021-03-27 09:12:08 map 2 is this screenshot
general 2021-03-27 09:12:41 so i do have the wrong cgx
general 2021-03-27 09:12:47 or palette
general 2021-03-27 09:19:39 map2 live
general 2021-03-27 09:26:02 the screenshots show this map at night
general 2021-03-27 09:26:16 so i think this used to use a night palette
general 2021-03-27 09:26:24 but there's only night2
general 2021-03-27 09:30:24 night2 looks similar but some colours are definitely wrong
general 2021-03-27 09:39:40 what happened
general 2021-03-27 09:41:28 holy shit <@!403843930543882241> what have you done

general 2021-03-27 09:43:26 very nice
general 2021-03-27 11:29:21 espuma
general 2021-03-27 11:41:15 i’m honestly thinking of making a checklist to see which palette is correct
general 2021-03-27 11:41:19 for map2
general 2021-03-27 12:23:06 i'm literally making a checklist of col files
general 2021-03-27 12:23:11 it's pain
general 2021-03-27 13:15:51 map2 is getting close to reconstruction
general 2021-03-27 13:15:55 well partially
general 2021-03-27 13:16:13 i don't think the correct colour file exists
general 2021-03-27 13:16:20 or i can't find it
general 2021-03-27 13:24:41 map2? idk if this is the right palette or cgx file

general 2021-03-28 05:54:30 i wonder how the dragonfly ost sounded
general 2021-03-28 05:54:42 i wish there's a sound binary
general 2021-03-28 05:54:51 like with super mario kart
general 2021-03-28 05:54:59 the game
general 2021-03-28 06:00:00 these are actually sound binaries from pilotwings
general 2021-03-28 06:00:14 final pilotwings
general 2021-03-28 06:06:58 this is from another sound binary, which is the simcity ost played with super mario kart instruments
general 2021-03-28 06:09:11 the only thing related to super mario kart in the binary
general 2021-03-28 08:34:26 idk
general 2021-03-28 08:34:29 i think so
general 2021-03-28 08:36:26 oh gabriel is still here

general 2021-04-01 11:19:15 idk
general 2021-04-01 11:19:26 i made it using internal nintendo assets so
general 2021-04-01 11:19:41 no
general 2021-04-01 11:19:43 lol
general 2021-04-01 11:19:54 dragonfly is pilotwings
general 2021-04-01 11:20:05 a mode 7 flight simulator for the snes
general 2021-04-01 11:20:31 red
general 2021-04-01 11:21:00 and it sort of turned into an action game (dragonfly 1989)
general 2021-04-01 11:21:14 then it turned back into a flight simulator
general 2021-04-01 11:21:19 (1990)
general 2021-04-01 11:23:17 no
general 2021-04-01 11:23:36 https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/14/pilotwings-snes-proto/
general 2021-04-01 11:23:53 no
general 2021-04-01 11:24:05 it's unseen64
general 2021-04-01 11:25:00 this article is a bit wrong lol
general 2021-04-01 11:25:21 but it's still one of the only explanations of dragonfly's development on the internet
general 2021-04-01 11:28:59 it's the plane crazy quid update
general 2021-04-01 11:34:29 quality
general 2021-04-01 12:02:02 better choice
general 2021-04-01 12:05:16 you just do it
bot-central 2021-04-01 22:04:03 -pccmc
general 2021-04-01 23:36:39 you have to find it yourself
general 2021-04-01 23:38:48 oh no
general 2021-04-01 23:38:52 not the gravel
general 2021-04-01 23:43:25 i just found out how to rip spc700 samples
general 2021-04-01 23:51:05 il guitar
general 2021-04-01 23:57:36 another guitar from fx trax
general 2021-04-02 00:05:26 spc2it actually does a decent job of converting the spc700 instructions to a modern equivalent, but it isn't exactly the same
general 2021-04-02 00:05:44 original file
general 2021-04-02 00:07:49 basically extracted the samples from the spc using spc2it and openmpt
general 2021-04-02 00:13:40 snes sound files
general 2021-04-02 00:13:44 but not really
general 2021-04-02 00:14:05 yes
general 2021-04-02 00:14:44 they're called spc files because they have the spc700 instructions that modern programs can emulate
general 2021-04-02 00:15:07 yeah
general 2021-04-02 00:15:19 that sample was from the stunt race fx prototype
general 2021-04-02 00:15:29 when it was called fx trax
general 2021-04-02 00:15:45 yeah
general 2021-04-02 00:16:47 stunt race fx february 1994 proto orchestral hit
general 2021-04-02 00:30:00 this is a raw snes sound file
general 2021-04-02 00:30:20 before the rom is even built
general 2021-04-02 00:30:50 idk how to make snes music i guess they used a proprietary tool lol
general 2021-04-02 00:32:41 this is music02
general 2021-04-02 00:33:23 .bin file made into a .spc file, then converted into wav
general 2021-04-02 01:37:12 one thing i noticed about the simcity tracks used to test super mario kart's sound driver
general 2021-04-02 01:37:20 the title theme is faster
general 2021-04-02 01:37:47 and the budget theme has a different start
general 2021-04-02 01:37:56 hi
general 2021-04-02 01:41:03 the closest i could get it to sound remotely like the original
general 2021-04-02 01:52:06 this is a bit faster compared to the original

general 2021-04-02 01:55:38 quid
general 2021-04-02 01:55:46 yes
general 2021-04-02 01:56:06 because 1 quid = 1000 usd
general 2021-04-02 02:15:50 all the simcity tracks used for testing super mario kart were modified
general 2021-04-02 02:16:06 to accommodate for the new instruments
general 2021-04-02 02:16:19 i tested it
general 2021-04-02 02:16:44 luckily one of the channels weren't modified that much
general 2021-04-02 02:21:14 reupload because i accidentally left a channel unmuted
general 2021-04-02 02:26:06 all the channels in the budget theme were modified in the smk testing version
general 2021-04-02 02:26:12 
general 2021-04-02 02:26:20 which is a shame because it had a different beginning
general 2021-04-02 02:26:39 so this might be an earlier version of the simcity ost
general 2021-04-02 02:33:18 no
general 2021-04-02 02:33:58 it's this https://youtu.be/srZSShYs4ew

general 2021-04-02 11:53:53 looks like some attract mode
general 2021-04-02 11:53:58 or before a level
general 2021-04-02 11:56:13 myship.cgx

general 2021-04-02 12:22:52 yes
general 2021-04-02 12:23:04 it's the dragonfly lol
general 2021-04-02 12:23:22 no
general 2021-04-02 12:23:52 no wonder why the source code isn't there
general 2021-04-02 12:25:07 there's different revisions of the dragonfly sprite
general 2021-04-02 12:25:20 might document this on tcrf if i feel like it
general 2021-04-02 12:25:40 since the pilotwings prerelease page is a literal mess
general 2021-04-02 12:26:23 https://tcrf.net/Prerelease:Pilotwings/Internal_Material this sucks lol
general 2021-04-02 12:26:58 wrong palettes on every sprite except the logo

general 2021-04-02 23:47:54 even better
general 2021-04-03 00:46:40 i think that they put in the secret command stuff in pilotwings as an excuse to use some code made for dragonfly
general 2021-04-03 00:47:39 dragonfly controls (idk if the cgx is right)
general 2021-04-03 00:48:07 helicopter controls from pilotwings
general 2021-04-03 00:48:19 literally the same
general 2021-04-03 00:49:12 need to extract the helicopter sprites to see how it was stored in the rom
general 2021-04-03 01:03:41 ok so i got cgxviewer
general 2021-04-03 01:04:07 but there's a glaring issue
general 2021-04-03 01:04:28 colour wrong

general 2021-06-25 11:57:13 just keep ants in drawer
general 2021-06-25 12:07:42 sinnit
general 2021-06-25 12:10:05 olihere
general 2021-06-25 12:44:14 it's gonna be a sequel
general 2021-06-25 12:44:31 hopefully we can use our same saves
general 2021-06-25 12:44:55 idk if that's possible i've never developed a roblox game
general 2021-06-25 12:45:36 
general 2021-06-25 13:17:17 put graphics up
general 2021-06-25 13:25:48 did you remove them
general 2021-06-25 13:26:25 good
general 2021-06-25 13:27:20 because it's against the roblox terms of use
general 2021-06-25 13:37:31 south london
general 2021-06-25 13:37:44 sinnit
general 2021-06-25 13:38:44 holy shit the source files for fx trax in the leak are way earlier than i thought
general 2021-06-25 13:39:23 no wonder why it's so much like a test
general 2021-06-25 13:53:17 most of the stunt race fx models and basically almost all of the code is missing from the leak
general 2021-06-25 13:53:20 that sucks
general 2021-06-25 13:53:44 i can't
general 2021-06-25 13:53:51 this is from 94
general 2021-06-25 13:54:43 they probably took them
general 2021-06-25 13:54:55 because these look like leftovers from fx trax
general 2021-06-25 13:55:18 nintendo
general 2021-06-25 13:56:24 the code from stunt race fx was probably in one of the many failed news backups
general 2021-06-25 13:58:27 these are probably leftovers from various builds
general 2021-06-25 13:58:45 because there's fx trax stuff and stunt race fx stuff
general 2021-06-25 13:59:18 wouldn't make sense to keep the old assets in the build folders
general 2021-06-25 13:59:47 because it'll be building the game with the wrong assets
general 2021-06-25 14:07:45 there might be a chance that one file is named exactly the same as another one
general 2021-06-25 14:07:51 such as title.cgx
general 2021-06-26 13:24:50 moose why did you buy 100 million dollars worth of lights

the-dump 2021-07-05 07:21:39 yes
the-dump 2021-07-05 07:21:50 he even had nsfw channel in his server
the-dump 2021-07-05 07:22:03 and he had age roles
the-dump 2021-07-05 07:22:12 it was visible to every role

general 2021-07-05 08:08:12 unfinished
general 2021-07-05 08:08:13 just wasn't quite right
general 2021-07-05 08:19:13 what
general 2021-07-05 08:23:13 yeah it wasn't done that well
general 2021-07-05 08:24:12 thanks
general 2021-07-05 08:25:36 this is the best imo
general 2021-07-05 08:25:48 idk i take the original music data and make it sound better
general 2021-07-05 08:27:50 well basically it is
general 2021-07-05 08:28:00 final level from an obscure snes game
general 2021-07-05 08:28:17 not limited by snes apu
general 2021-07-05 08:30:29 i meant snes s-dsp, the sound produced from it is only 32khz
general 2021-07-05 08:32:17 https://sneslab.net/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System
general 2021-07-05 08:32:54 ok so basically the original
general 2021-07-05 08:33:29 after
general 2021-07-05 08:33:55 i basically take away the limitations of the s-dsp
general 2021-07-05 08:34:33 openmpt
general 2021-07-05 08:34:37 tracker
general 2021-07-05 08:35:16 but i basically convert the snes sound data to usable tracker data
general 2021-07-05 08:35:25 since the snes relies on samples
general 2021-07-05 08:39:47 tracker
general 2021-07-05 08:40:37 yeah but converting the music data to a tracker format is more "accurate"
general 2021-07-05 08:42:32 but removing the s-dsp removes the built in effects made by the snes
general 2021-07-05 08:44:05 there is an eq in there
general 2021-07-05 08:50:27 him

general 2021-07-16 00:48:39 there's literally 5 year olds on roblox
general 2021-07-16 00:49:43 not really, it only just censors random words
general 2021-07-16 02:21:31 nothing
general 2021-07-16 02:21:38 not worth spending
general 2021-07-16 02:21:52 unless it's for audio or some shit
general 2021-07-16 02:22:03 because they lowered audio prices

general 2021-07-16 11:45:12 no it makes me die of cringe
general 2021-07-16 11:46:55 i think the main reason why fnf is so popular is the characters
general 2021-07-16 11:48:33 most of the fanbase doesn't even know about newgrounds
general 2021-07-16 11:48:44 or only knows about newgrounds from fnf
general 2021-07-16 11:49:16 same, but i can understand that newgrounds left a legacy
general 2021-07-16 11:57:36 a big one
general 2021-07-16 11:57:51 i know
general 2021-07-16 11:57:56 it isn't
general 2021-07-16 11:58:26 it's content only made for profit
general 2021-07-17 05:02:55 maybe because of filter he had to spell it that way idk

general 2021-08-18 06:15:14 there's 7 frames of it
general 2021-08-18 06:15:28 but it's as simple as changing the last 4 points
general 2021-08-18 06:16:48 it's a conversion
general 2021-08-18 06:17:11 there is not much details because this was designed for the super fx
general 2021-08-18 06:18:44 the door opens?
general 2021-08-18 06:27:19 trying to decrypt the 3dg1 model format
general 2021-08-18 06:27:32 <:brainer:855527536757571584>
general 2021-08-18 06:27:44 it's very closely related to .obj
general 2021-08-18 06:28:43 https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2013/spring/cs493/lecture/02_07_meshes.html
general 2021-08-18 06:29:41 the top segment is the points
general 2021-08-18 06:29:47 the bottom is the faces
general 2021-08-18 06:29:59 the header defines the amount of points
general 2021-08-18 06:31:33 progress
general 2021-08-18 06:31:43 yes
general 2021-08-18 06:31:49 it's double conversion
general 2021-08-18 06:32:16 from the superfx model format to 3dg1 then to .obj
general 2021-08-18 06:35:25 it's easy to just convert 3dg1 to obj by hand
general 2021-08-18 06:35:33 but a tool is easier
general 2021-08-18 06:41:05 individual frames all done
general 2021-08-18 06:41:14 time to combine into 1 .anm file
general 2021-08-18 06:45:30 model stuff

general 2021-08-18 07:02:18 this is a group of very early super fx models
general 2021-08-18 07:02:51 1 year before the release of first super fx game, starfox
general 2021-08-18 07:04:50 that was it for now
general 2021-08-18 07:04:57 i converted almost every model

general 2021-08-19 03:39:25 there are no textures
general 2021-08-19 03:41:42 like these are just raw conversions
general 2021-08-19 03:42:39 what
general 2021-08-19 03:55:00 sorry but these are literally being converted with the purpose of inserting them into starfox, which doesn't have much textures. they are very resource intensive on the super fx chip
general 2021-08-19 03:58:36 damn same zero was shit

general 2021-08-28 13:20:03 the funny windmill or the other one?
general 2021-08-28 13:20:45 because you aren't allowed to post builds with the funny german windmill in them
general 2021-08-28 13:20:54 but the soviet flag is fine
general 2021-08-28 13:21:02 woodworking tips
general 2021-08-28 13:21:17 yeah it still applies
general 2021-08-28 13:22:23 it's getting there
general 2021-08-28 14:09:11 the afterburner booklet from the box set is cool
general 2021-08-28 14:09:23 yes this is a scan because i can't get it since it's japan only
general 2021-08-28 14:17:46 idk let me check
general 2021-08-28 14:19:12 344 dollars
general 2021-08-28 14:19:15 what the fuck
general 2021-08-28 14:22:16 it's been out of print since like 2007
general 2021-08-28 14:22:23 that's why it's expensive
general 2021-08-28 14:34:55 waiting for spar money
general 2021-08-28 14:45:59 they most likely won't add bearings
general 2021-08-28 14:46:17 because of limitations
general 2021-08-28 14:46:33 this is a roblox game
general 2021-08-28 14:46:50 the engine is limited
general 2021-08-28 14:47:35 yeah true
general 2021-08-28 14:47:45 but rick is focusing on the main game
general 2021-08-28 14:48:42 true
general 2021-08-28 14:49:01 they're just everywhere
general 2021-08-28 14:49:33 we need to actually make spar tycoon
general 2021-08-28 14:53:00 yeah
general 2021-08-28 14:53:09 yeah it was a stupid statement
general 2021-08-28 14:53:44 also not sure how the infinite map would work
general 2021-08-28 14:53:50 would it be bare
general 2021-08-28 14:54:30 
general 2021-08-28 14:55:24 i think just making a different map would've been a better idea
general 2021-08-28 14:55:36 but then there would be designing
general 2021-08-28 14:55:41 making the map
general 2021-08-28 14:55:57 there was that concept a while ago
general 2021-08-28 14:56:16 and it was partly made already
general 2021-08-28 14:57:01 how would pvp work
general 2021-08-28 14:57:39 because if it's infinite people can just move away
general 2021-08-28 14:58:50 maybe in pvp mode there would be a limit to the map
general 2021-08-28 14:59:01 so people couldn't go too far out
general 2021-08-28 14:59:13 but they can still go a reasonable distance away
general 2021-08-28 15:00:01 pc pvp is chaotic sometimes
general 2021-08-28 15:00:11 that's what makes it fun imo
general 2021-08-28 15:00:30 what stream

general 2021-09-10 12:00:47 if you want actual advice just live with it and clean the blood with a tissue
general 2021-09-10 12:04:49 imagine only being 13

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:42:46 and they have different standards of build quality
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:43:21 and then i say that nobody thinks alike
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:05 then he starts going off for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:14 i don't even think he read what i said
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:44:26 because it's explained all there

general 2021-09-24 10:43:42 what are you trying to eject

general 2021-09-24 10:44:10 you push the stop/eject button
general 2021-09-24 10:44:27 depending on the model it's a seperate button
general 2021-09-24 10:44:54 oh so it is a cd drive
general 2021-09-24 10:45:47 there's a small hole on most cd drives that can be used to manually open it
general 2021-09-24 10:46:01 you just need a paperclip
general 2021-09-24 10:46:32 wait i don't even know what laptop it is
general 2021-09-24 10:46:39 but i assume so yes
general 2021-09-24 10:48:46 if this is the worst you've seen, you've seen nothing
general 2021-09-24 10:51:26 cd drives only have 1 small hole that is used to manually open it so it's most likely the right one <@!621817208313479248>

general 2021-10-05 06:49:42 i figured it out
general 2021-10-05 06:49:58 i figured out why the palette is being such a pain in the ass
general 2021-10-05 06:50:51 the first colour in each line sort of operates on a hierarchy system
general 2021-10-05 06:52:44 so if the bg uses 2 lines, the first colour in the line above will be used, no matter which line is said to be used in a segment
general 2021-10-05 06:53:05 just like this
general 2021-10-05 06:53:38 the green is replaced with the brown because of starfox's piece of shit palette system

general 2021-10-10 22:51:48 jesus
general 2021-10-10 22:57:41 yeah the oled model is good to get if you don't have the original switch
general 2021-10-10 22:58:02 i have had it since launch
general 2021-10-10 22:58:42 yeah the drift is shit
general 2021-10-10 22:59:06 i have gone through 2 pairs of joycons
general 2021-10-10 22:59:17 but i have a fix
general 2021-10-10 22:59:30 1. buy the pro controller
general 2021-10-10 22:59:48 it's cheaper than a pair of joycons and it lasts for years
general 2021-10-10 23:00:40 step 2: cry about smash bros
general 2021-10-10 23:02:55 if people are saying that nintendo has become apple now they have missed out on a lot of shit

general 2021-10-10 23:03:26 twice
general 2021-10-10 23:05:31 well the stand is only used for playing in tabletop mode
general 2021-10-10 23:05:48 but the original stand is a piece of shit
general 2021-10-10 23:06:14 no it's just a horrible design
general 2021-10-10 23:06:22 it only supports it on 1 side
general 2021-10-10 23:06:45 yeah it works at least
general 2021-10-10 23:07:10 but it should've had the switch oled kickstand from the start
general 2021-10-10 23:08:03 if you can't handle it just get a pro controller
general 2021-10-10 23:08:11 cheaper than a pair of joycons

general 2021-10-13 08:42:22 i know nothing about coding
general 2021-10-13 08:43:34 like if it's starfox's code, i can do a simple palette change or a scroll change
general 2021-10-13 08:44:03 but starfox's code is heavily macro based
general 2021-10-13 08:44:39 so instead of a random function it's "bgXscroll"
general 2021-10-13 08:44:49 or "bgYscroll"
general 2021-10-13 08:46:30 hi

general 2021-10-13 08:55:39 you have to decode it before you assume
general 2021-10-13 09:01:46 also i just noticed this a year after the nintendo leak https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLR-NUIKjmI
general 2021-10-13 09:01:57 how did i miss this

general 2021-10-13 09:09:22 
general 2021-10-13 09:12:09 i just realised

general 2021-10-13 09:13:59 idk this is one of the only things i know how to change
general 2021-10-13 09:14:06 and it's not python
general 2021-10-13 09:14:46 it's a mix of snes asm and starfox's own language
general 2021-10-13 09:14:52 which is full of labels
general 2021-10-13 09:17:24 <@!632942443536318494> <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-10-13 09:17:48 best part
general 2021-10-13 09:17:52 i can put this in the game
general 2021-10-13 09:18:02 and the first message will be 99er somet
general 2021-10-13 09:18:12 hold on let me try
general 2021-10-13 09:51:57 time to build rom
general 2021-10-13 10:13:00 i found where the final message file is stored in the source

general 2021-10-13 10:33:40 such a great tool
general 2021-10-13 10:33:52 i'm so glad it was included in the source
general 2021-10-13 10:38:26 we need cursed star fox 2
general 2021-10-13 10:38:55 where most of the messages are just things 99er has said
general 2021-10-13 10:39:31 idk we need to figure out the sound format
general 2021-10-13 10:40:07 this would be a great message to put in
general 2021-10-13 10:41:47 such a cool message
general 2021-10-13 10:43:00 only thing is the tool doesn't support keyboard
general 2021-10-13 10:43:06 you have to click the letters
general 2021-10-13 10:43:13 1 by 1
general 2021-10-13 10:47:03 i should use a later version of the tool
general 2021-10-13 11:19:34 16clampa
general 2021-10-13 11:35:51 ocarina of time link giving game advice
general 2021-10-13 12:51:02 we're doing some fucking wizardry in star fox
general 2021-10-13 12:51:23 the titania boss room bg is sort of like a "green screen"
general 2021-10-13 12:51:43 the green is transparent which produces the road effect
general 2021-10-13 12:58:22 palette literally the fortuna one but changed
general 2021-10-13 13:25:25 i have a ps4 and i don't care

general 2021-10-13 13:25:59 well the wii u had metroid fusion
general 2021-10-13 13:26:06 that's one thing going for it
general 2021-10-13 13:27:20 gamepad was there in order to play off the tv and it couldn't last a couple steps away from the console
general 2021-10-13 13:28:53 we couldn't get the scrolling trick to work
general 2021-10-13 13:29:01 idfk how they did it at nintendo
general 2021-10-13 13:29:07 we can't replicate it
general 2021-10-13 13:29:49 let me show
general 2021-10-13 13:29:52 i stream
general 2021-10-13 13:30:42 hold on i have the final game one

general 2021-10-13 13:33:19 i don't have a savestate for it but here's a videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxsmj2V_VY&ab_channel=XyllukTheDragon

general 2021-10-13 13:40:07 simulated scrolling
general 2021-10-13 13:40:21 2 layer transparent bg
general 2021-10-13 13:41:13 it's also tied to the speed of the arwing
general 2021-10-13 13:42:31 not only did they use real 3d models, they did this shit
general 2021-10-13 13:43:48 this source code mod also removes the boundaries usually in the game
general 2021-10-13 13:46:02 argonaut knew what they were doing when developing star fox
general 2021-10-13 13:46:18 this shit doesn't even appear in star fox 2
general 2021-10-13 13:47:42 i think i fucked up the perspective
general 2021-10-13 13:49:59 yeah i am using a mod of the source code which enables semi free roaming
general 2021-10-13 13:52:10 i got mesen which allows me to view the bg layers
general 2021-10-13 13:52:52 layer 3 is the bg, 2bpp
general 2021-10-13 13:52:59 layer 2 is the overlay
general 2021-10-13 13:53:41 and layer 1 is the shape data converted to graphics

general 2021-10-19 10:30:50 just ask them a question
general 2021-10-19 10:31:07 well it's not really trust and safety i just call it that
general 2021-10-19 10:31:39 no that unde that got perm muted likes it
general 2021-10-19 10:37:34 the stunt race fx spc rips aren't great
general 2021-10-19 10:37:48 you can hear the race countdown at the start
general 2021-10-19 10:38:41 i think night owl is missing a drum at the start
general 2021-10-19 10:39:04 sunset valley is one of the only good rips
general 2021-10-19 10:39:11 what if you get stuck
general 2021-10-19 10:39:13 in the river
general 2021-10-19 10:40:23 but his truck will get stuck
general 2021-10-19 10:40:29 and he has to fix it
general 2021-10-19 10:41:18 LO
general 2021-10-19 10:41:21 you have to fix it
general 2021-10-19 10:43:13 you can literally hear part of the race countdown
general 2021-10-19 10:45:04 i predicted it
general 2021-10-19 10:46:01 6mb flac
general 2021-10-19 10:46:03 how is this possible
general 2021-10-19 10:47:17 we could've gotten good rips of the final game's ost but we don't have the source
general 2021-10-19 10:49:49 only thing left is the listing of the sound files
general 2021-10-19 10:50:10 for some reason it's a mix of .bgm files and .bin files
general 2021-10-19 10:50:37 why both filetypes?
general 2021-10-19 10:50:52 i only understand that they are the files
general 2021-10-19 10:50:56 and the checksum
general 2021-10-19 10:51:16 oh also the date and time
general 2021-10-19 10:54:36 they also ditched the crunched colour palette files (pco) and kept the crunched graphics files (pcg) as well as the crunched tilemap files (psc)
general 2021-10-19 10:55:01 idk why stunt race fx used those files
general 2021-10-19 10:55:12 they're literally ccr and pcr files
general 2021-10-19 10:55:23 but with a different extension
general 2021-10-19 10:55:53 honestly idk what the extensions stand for
general 2021-10-19 10:56:22 i think pco is packed colour?
general 2021-10-19 10:56:35 pcg is packed colour graphics i think
general 2021-10-19 10:56:57 psc is packed screen (tilemap)
general 2021-10-19 10:58:36 maybe ccr is cgx crunched?
general 2021-10-19 10:58:50 maybe pcr is tilemap crunched
general 2021-10-19 10:59:10 either way they are the same format
general 2021-10-19 11:05:18 i don't even really play roblox
general 2021-10-19 11:05:31 because there is nothing interesting on roblox
general 2021-10-19 11:26:32 https://tenor.com/view/rip-pack-bozo-dead-gif-20309754
general 2021-10-19 11:29:00 yeah that's a real lie
general 2021-10-19 11:29:11 private servers don't work like that
general 2021-10-19 11:29:19 they are not linked to discord roles
general 2021-10-19 11:29:44 you need the link to join this one
general 2021-10-19 11:29:56 rank doesn't matter
general 2021-10-19 11:30:06 if you have the link you have access

general 2021-10-19 11:36:14 if someone leaked the link on a public server there would be a lot of people

general 2021-10-29 07:01:00 nice
general 2021-10-29 07:17:51 it's going to be epic
general 2021-10-29 07:18:18 incredible
general 2021-10-29 07:19:23 why did it take me so long to try using vsnes to save a raw snes palette as pal
general 2021-10-29 07:19:31 i feel stupid now
general 2021-10-29 07:20:59 i need palette so i can make planet texture without switching between 2 screens and counting the colours
general 2021-10-29 07:23:02 just a little problem
general 2021-10-29 07:23:07 what emulator
general 2021-10-29 07:23:28 yes that is totally an emulator
general 2021-10-29 07:23:48 ok
general 2021-10-29 07:24:26 i don't really play roblox
general 2021-10-29 07:24:47 playing star fox is more fun than roblox for me
general 2021-10-29 07:27:39 bsnes is great for alternate controller keybinds
general 2021-10-29 07:27:51 snes9x has none of that
general 2021-10-29 07:28:07 you have 1 set of controller keybinds
general 2021-10-29 07:28:11 and that's it
general 2021-10-29 07:34:37 i'm streaming an early build of star fox 2
general 2021-10-29 07:34:51 i have never played it except looking at the map
general 2021-10-29 07:34:57 before yesterday
general 2021-10-29 07:44:54 softlocked
general 2021-10-29 07:44:56 great
general 2021-10-29 07:46:12 town
general 2021-10-29 07:46:36 wait which starfox games have you played?
general 2021-10-29 07:46:46 i've only played the original snes titles
general 2021-10-29 07:47:10 27 years old
general 2021-10-29 07:47:13 i think
general 2021-10-29 07:47:29 and this is a buggy early build
general 2021-10-29 07:50:54 wait what
general 2021-10-29 07:54:03 what is this screen
general 2021-10-29 07:54:43 sorry about the horrendous palette but this is the most visible i've gotten it to look
general 2021-10-29 08:14:03 oh no
general 2021-10-29 09:48:55 99er
general 2021-10-29 09:49:30 99er
general 2021-10-29 11:03:35 8
general 2021-10-29 11:08:23 i don’t really know anything about coding in general
general 2021-10-29 11:09:16 i did the bgs
general 2021-10-29 11:09:40 also i converted an early superfx model using shaped
general 2021-10-29 11:10:24 all i did was put palette definition into the shape header and added a new player ship call
general 2021-10-29 11:10:48 but this is all starfox specific
general 2021-10-29 11:10:53 99er
general 2021-10-29 11:13:12 but bgs are quite simple if you know the limits
general 2021-10-29 11:13:44 the graphics have to be able to fit into vram
general 2021-10-29 11:14:15 otherwise the tilemap will call other parts of vram
general 2021-10-29 11:14:31 hold on I’ll get a screenshot of what it looks like
general 2021-10-29 11:17:48 this is what it does when the tilemap calls graphics that are outside of the allocated bg space in vram
general 2021-10-29 11:18:11 this is from when i was putting the fortuna bg in game
general 2021-10-29 11:33:43 <@!370594904268734464> all the stuff i know is specific to starfox and have to do with bgs such as camera movement settings, level overlay effects like ground dots, changing palettes, graphics, tilemaps, and hofmodes
general 2021-10-29 11:38:55 well then again this is all specific to starfox 1 on the snes
general 2021-10-29 11:46:16 starfox bgs need a pcr file (crunched tilemap), ccr file (crunched graphics) and allcols.pac, which contains almost every game palette and is made using the argonaut palette packer
general 2021-10-29 11:46:59 the associated batch file has the palettes to be packed
general 2021-10-29 11:47:22 so all that needs to be done is adding one of them and defining it in code
general 2021-10-29 11:48:15 hi
general 2021-10-29 11:55:22 so this is the bg code for sector x
general 2021-10-29 11:55:41 the chr and scr are actually the ccr and pcr files
general 2021-10-29 11:56:00 they are called 2-2.PCR/CCR
general 2021-10-29 11:57:01 von, hon, and zon control how the camera moves
general 2021-10-29 12:00:18 i think that guy sent his own face here a bunch of times
general 2021-10-29 12:01:28 fix
general 2021-10-29 12:02:05 like the truck

general 2021-11-10 11:35:43 found the original drawing
general 2021-11-10 11:35:54 i think someone else coloured it in
general 2021-11-10 11:36:16 because there is another obc chan
general 2021-11-10 11:36:27 drawn by the same person
general 2021-11-10 11:36:54 i think i am one of the only people to see that obc chan
general 2021-11-10 11:37:18 it's not the nsfw one
general 2021-11-10 11:37:25 it's a unique one
general 2021-11-10 11:38:31 it's got a ban gun
general 2021-11-10 11:38:48 i only know of 4 people including me who has seen it
general 2021-11-10 11:39:18 wonder what happened to all those drawings
general 2021-11-10 11:39:31 specifically the coloured madattak chan
general 2021-11-10 11:40:11 i know shadowdeveloper has many variations of madattak chan

general 2021-11-14 12:55:22 need to fix
general 2021-11-14 12:55:37 it's not demo3.cgx btw
general 2021-11-14 12:55:43 i must fix the cars
general 2021-11-14 13:08:30 fix racist
general 2021-11-14 13:08:41 again it's not demo3.cgx
general 2021-11-14 13:08:49 ok
general 2021-11-14 13:08:56 no
general 2021-11-14 13:11:27 i have to go back to the fxtrax build document
general 2021-11-14 13:11:33 i might've found the missing piece
general 2021-11-14 13:12:34 sort of
general 2021-11-14 13:12:45 i got some starfox 2 models into starfox 1
general 2021-11-14 13:12:59 because the model format is basically the same
general 2021-11-14 13:13:10 only there are added variables in starfox 2
general 2021-11-14 13:13:28 such as (model)_scale
general 2021-11-14 13:13:57 in order to keep every piece of the multipart models (there are a lot in starfox 2) the same size
general 2021-11-14 13:14:42 ofc the textures some models use won't carry over into starfox 1
general 2021-11-14 13:15:38 due to how the textures are not the same between both games
general 2021-11-14 13:15:47 they do use the same palette though
general 2021-11-14 13:16:42 i've gotten starfox 2 textures into starfox 1 and they aren't any different to how they display in starfox 2
general 2021-11-14 13:21:03 here's the missing part
general 2021-11-14 13:21:39 i wonder if it's possible to reverse engineer the argonaut texture format
general 2021-11-14 13:23:14 i forgot how to use sfxpolydump
general 2021-11-14 13:24:33 time to crunch hand.cgx and add it back into the game
general 2021-11-14 13:24:46 which is as simple as uncommenting the reference
general 2021-11-14 13:38:02 so hand.pcg is unused
general 2021-11-14 13:38:08 shows this code is early
general 2021-11-14 13:38:27 since this does have some portions of sces code
general 2021-11-14 13:38:41 but the majority of it is early
general 2021-11-14 13:39:34 wait no the game is just unstable
general 2021-11-14 13:40:28 
general 2021-11-14 13:40:31 
general 2021-11-14 13:40:51 like these gems are clearly part of the hud
general 2021-11-14 13:41:04 but they're just unused in this source
general 2021-11-14 13:41:36 also hand used as race countdown
general 2021-11-14 13:49:27 i have the "complete" version of fx trax now
general 2021-11-14 13:49:58 and by complete i mean hand.pcg is back in the game
general 2021-11-14 14:16:28 going out of your way to false report someone?
general 2021-11-14 14:16:46 3rd
general 2021-11-14 14:16:48 imagine
general 2021-11-14 14:17:07 fun fact: false reporting is against the discord tos
general 2021-11-14 14:21:44 you know not everyone wants to hand their information to discord
general 2021-11-14 14:21:57 like not your id and shit
general 2021-11-14 14:22:03 and your face
general 2021-11-14 14:22:35 but you went out of your way to get him banned and not the countless other people who have made unde jokes
general 2021-11-14 14:23:14 because it's a shitty thing to do
general 2021-11-14 14:24:55 also you don't really know, it seems to be a lot since he was trying to get his account back for days

general 2021-11-27 13:52:13 for example saturn and st-v emulation is very resource intensive while model2 arcade is faster

general 2021-12-19 14:19:37 hi
general 2021-12-19 14:20:45 play sky ramp in the snes car
general 2021-12-19 14:21:05 (controls are like a real car)
general 2021-12-19 14:31:27 actually did some starfox coding
general 2021-12-19 14:31:42 pretty basic but it's something at least
general 2021-12-19 14:32:36 basically a switch for the "scramble" text at the start of corneria, if it's a german build it displays "alarm"
general 2021-12-19 14:34:30 ifeq means if the variable, in this case "GERMAN" is 0 (found in VARS.ASM)
general 2021-12-19 14:34:50 if not it displays scramble
general 2021-12-19 14:35:40 all snes asm with superfx asm as well
general 2021-12-19 14:35:54 the latter is really confusing
general 2021-12-19 14:36:03 when compared to regular snes asm
general 2021-12-19 14:36:42 nope not really
general 2021-12-19 14:37:04 the source only got leaked last year
general 2021-12-19 14:43:36 i attempted to do stuff with fx trax levels but it's a nightmare
general 2021-12-19 14:44:23 huge difference working with something that is a mess compared to a final game's source

general 2022-01-06 14:11:24 turns out it's meant to be way more interactive than how it is in game

general 2022-01-06 14:17:53 what i'm standing on is meant to be a platforming challenge

general 2022-01-06 14:18:26 the steps just don't have collision for some reason
general 2022-01-06 14:21:28 meant to be the ring course
general 2022-01-06 14:21:47 again it just doesn't work
general 2022-01-06 14:22:23 one of the rings can be seen though

general 2022-01-07 09:02:04 the only reason i know the name is because someone pointed out that a character from it appears in an early version of starfox 2 as a placeholder

general 2022-01-07 09:16:06 amazing
general 2022-01-07 09:16:13 do you even use github
general 2022-01-07 09:18:47 github is for making repos for projects
general 2022-01-07 09:18:59 easy way for others to contribute
general 2022-01-07 09:20:27 i use it but not that much since we just talk and submit files in the project discord
general 2022-01-07 09:26:08 i've only submitted pull requests
general 2022-01-07 09:26:13 for starfox textures
general 2022-01-07 09:27:23 ok
general 2022-01-07 09:30:44 ok
general 2022-01-07 09:31:02 but wasting money is very funny
general 2022-01-07 09:31:40 windows phone
general 2022-01-07 10:25:29 ok
general 2022-01-07 10:36:27 it is crea
general 2022-01-07 10:39:21 the facility
general 2022-01-07 11:09:49 not commands
general 2022-01-07 11:11:07 20fps
general 2022-01-07 11:28:32 ces planet cannon fight
general 2022-01-07 11:29:08 i have many test maps for starfox 2 but i basically have no experience with the source
general 2022-01-07 11:29:37 so i have no clue how to add them to the test menu
general 2022-01-07 11:29:57 no
general 2022-01-07 11:30:04 i dabble with the code
general 2022-01-07 11:30:25 i had to recreate the script to build the palette
general 2022-01-07 11:30:47 and i want to get the dedicated training map in
general 2022-01-07 11:31:00 there are 3 but only the first one is cool
general 2022-01-07 11:32:05 the map is from an early build of starfox 2 but it's broken in it
general 2022-01-07 11:33:11 the things to start the practice challenges just do not work
general 2022-01-07 11:35:38 snes classic
general 2022-01-07 11:35:46 or nintendo switch online
general 2022-01-07 11:35:50 or the source
general 2022-01-07 11:36:08 i have the version used for the snes classic
general 2022-01-07 11:36:17 which is the final us rom
general 2022-01-07 11:37:30 this is for the ring course but it's broken
general 2022-01-07 11:37:42 early build btw
general 2022-01-07 11:38:35 the easybuild is better though since you can build a debug enabled rom
general 2022-01-07 11:41:14 just level select and strategy debugging apparently
general 2022-01-07 11:41:28 only thing that matters is level select though
general 2022-01-07 11:42:19 it's a full menu where you can choose the map and step
general 2022-01-07 11:42:38 step determines the layout
general 2022-01-07 11:43:25

general 2022-01-10 06:54:15 literally can't decide go choose 1 set

general 2022-01-10 07:03:24 0-2 is corneria
0-3 is ground
1c is water
2 is sand

choose wisely
general 2022-01-10 07:04:47 just going to put the water bg in
general 2022-01-10 07:25:37 i was very wrong regarding more bg space in starfox 2
general 2022-01-10 07:26:22 top - starfox 1 titania
bottom - starfox 2 titania
general 2022-01-10 07:26:44 i initially said that the big font is what takes up space in vram
general 2022-01-10 07:27:09 and i said that starfox 2's hud isn't as big
general 2022-01-10 07:27:29 but the hud is actually bigger
general 2022-01-10 07:27:58 the space that the bg uses in starfox 2 is filled with garbage data in starfox 1

general 2022-01-10 13:19:42 ultimate gaming setup
general 2022-01-10 13:24:10 why do you want a skin
general 2022-01-10 13:24:35 what's wrong with just having stock back
general 2022-01-10 13:25:01 get ghostbusters one it would be very funny

general 2022-01-10 13:51:34 unrelated but if anybody here wants to get into snes emulation don't use zsnes

general 2022-01-10 13:52:52 seed
general 2022-01-10 13:53:30 yeah i forgot what seeding is in terms of torrenting

general 2022-01-10 13:58:37 the power
general 2022-01-10 14:01:10 remember when i said i was going to insert a bg into starfox 2
general 2022-01-10 14:01:18 yeah kind of forgot about that
general 2022-01-10 14:01:38 then i decided to look into vram to sort out our bg limit
general 2022-01-10 14:02:40 seed is dying
general 2022-01-10 14:02:46 cool
general 2022-01-10 14:03:11 seed what is happening

general 2022-01-10 14:04:50 real gaming
general 2022-01-10 14:07:46 saw this super metroid tas need to find it again
general 2022-01-10 14:09:58 https://youtu.be/Rn9Qufkwl0o the only part that matters is the beginning cutscene
general 2022-01-10 14:11:27 you are now system32
general 2022-01-10 14:11:43 very funny virus
general 2022-01-10 14:12:24 he lives in thailand
general 2022-01-10 14:14:28 yousuf is like the only one who cares about my starfox snes hacking here
general 2022-01-10 14:15:38 i've never been banned
general 2022-01-10 14:17:00 got sidetracked again
general 2022-01-10 14:19:18 all this starfox 2 bg stuff is new to me
general 2022-01-10 14:19:57 i have to manually define the palette parameters in pc.bat rather than just putting it there
general 2022-01-10 14:20:03 oh sick
general 2022-01-10 14:20:29 the limit is bigger than starfox 1
general 2022-01-10 14:20:48 so more choice
general 2022-01-10 14:21:20 oh
general 2022-01-10 14:21:28 someone is remaking starfox for pc
general 2022-01-10 14:22:47 remaking starfox for pc is cool but i feel like it loses its charm
general 2022-01-10 14:23:01 it's not really 3d running on a snes anymore isn't it?
general 2022-01-10 14:24:51 i use an ipad
general 2022-01-10 14:25:03 because it's portable and i like ios
general 2022-01-10 14:25:31 i've used android devices too but i just like ios more
general 2022-01-10 14:26:33 wonder if dylan will shed some light on the way vram is arranged in starfox 1
general 2022-01-10 14:28:48 he already explained how they shifted over to the snes 3d modeller "fundoshi", made in house by kawaguchi at nintendo
general 2022-01-10 14:29:03 we have the graphics for it but no source
general 2022-01-10 14:29:49 and i got sidetracked again
general 2022-01-10 14:31:47 it has begun
general 2022-01-10 14:32:28 reason why it's a separate folder is because the main folder is messy
general 2022-01-10 14:32:42 idk what i name my files honestly
general 2022-01-10 14:33:35 i would send a screenshot of the main folder but it's too messy lol
general 2022-01-10 14:35:23 here's the folder i used for reconstructing the graphics for the pal/german version of starfox
general 2022-01-10 14:35:26 it's hell
general 2022-01-10 14:36:17 time to get to doing stuff
general 2022-01-10 14:36:50 i'm adding a bg into starfox 2
general 2022-01-10 14:37:10 specifically an early fortuna background
general 2022-01-10 14:37:25 it'll look sick
general 2022-01-10 14:37:30 (if it works)
general 2022-01-10 14:47:26 hi moon
general 2022-01-10 14:50:04 seems like this will be smooth sailing
general 2022-01-10 14:50:34 fits into vram limit which is good
general 2022-01-10 14:57:38 progress
general 2022-01-10 15:08:32 it built
general 2022-01-10 15:12:01 hi
general 2022-01-10 15:18:03 oh no
general 2022-01-10 15:18:05 very bad
general 2022-01-10 15:18:24 have to remove this now source is ruined
general 2022-01-10 15:18:38 it has fr*nce in it
general 2022-01-10 15:29:22 ok the bg does require modification
general 2022-01-10 15:51:59 <@!370594904268734464> it's in
general 2022-01-10 15:52:11 early 1993 fortuna
general 2022-01-10 16:00:04 exclusive live look at early fortuna bg
general 2022-01-10 16:01:31 actually don't care not refined yet
general 2022-01-10 16:02:24 does work but the top is just blank tiles to test
general 2022-01-10 16:04:05 underwater is kind of broken due to how it is
general 2022-01-10 16:04:21 i'm using mode2h16
general 2022-01-10 16:04:39 while it's supposed to be using mode2v16
general 2022-01-11 00:20:22 seed
general 2022-01-11 00:43:06 since the first bg was kind of broken i’m doing another one
general 2022-01-11 00:43:27 either another water one (that works properly this time)
general 2022-01-11 00:43:33 or desert
general 2022-01-11 00:48:02 reminds me of aqua tunnel from stunt race fx
general 2022-01-11 00:48:19 what
general 2022-01-11 00:48:56 never played sapphire so idk
general 2022-01-11 00:49:46 going to find aqua tunnel graphics
general 2022-01-11 00:50:59 here's aqua tunnel
general 2022-01-11 00:51:21 yes that's all the bg graphics for it
general 2022-01-11 00:51:50 the reason for that is because stunt race uses hdma to display coloured strips
general 2022-01-11 00:52:17 so this is what the bg looks like after hdma
general 2022-01-11 00:52:49 the usage of hdma went as far back as the fx trax days
general 2022-01-11 00:53:35 the build we have of fx trax (early alpha) doesn't use hdma for bgs
general 2022-01-11 00:54:13 weird
general 2022-01-11 00:54:19 never happened to me before

general 2022-01-11 06:41:13 don’t unban seed
general 2022-01-11 06:41:17 make seed wait
general 2022-01-11 06:45:23 no
general 2022-01-11 07:17:51 i’ve had a great experience with the keyboard
general 2022-01-11 07:18:24 the w key literally broke off due to use
general 2022-01-11 07:18:53 like the little fragile clips in the keycap just gave up
general 2022-01-11 07:19:43 seed gets upset if people say lenovo is bad
general 2022-01-11 07:19:57 yeah it is
general 2022-01-11 07:20:15 i have experience
general 2022-01-11 07:21:03 thinkpads peaked with ibm
general 2022-01-11 07:22:04 i don’t play games on pc that much
general 2022-01-11 07:22:21 so no need for a gaming keyboard
general 2022-01-11 07:22:23 hi
general 2022-01-11 08:28:48 scam

general 2022-01-11 09:05:41 wtf
general 2022-01-11 09:05:59 get rid of it if it's like that
general 2022-01-11 09:08:00 probably salty about their builds getting downvoted
general 2022-01-11 09:18:57 idk i don't play roblox anymore
general 2022-01-11 10:05:17 yousuf i did it
general 2022-01-11 10:05:33 unseen version of early fortuna
general 2022-01-11 10:06:37 no this is just a replacement for fortuna's bg
general 2022-01-11 10:06:56 there is a better version which has more colours but it's configured wrong for some reason
general 2022-01-11 10:07:20 this is it btw
general 2022-01-11 10:07:38 supposed to be like this though
general 2022-01-11 10:07:47 so i have to flip the screens
general 2022-01-11 10:08:07 not easy when it treats it as 8x8
general 2022-01-11 10:09:25 original build with the bg
general 2022-01-11 10:09:31 well one of them at least
general 2022-01-11 10:09:38 there are 3 which have it
general 2022-01-11 10:09:59 the one i'm using is compatible with the water effect
general 2022-01-11 10:10:58 starfox 2
general 2022-01-11 10:11:21 the 1993 one was the best imo why did they change it to this foggy one
general 2022-01-11 10:12:28 time to get another one in i'll be back
general 2022-01-11 10:12:41 the one with more colours
general 2022-01-11 10:13:11 interestingly the first seen variant isn't in the files
general 2022-01-11 10:22:18 ok building rom
general 2022-01-11 10:24:34 and i've reached the limit on palettes
general 2022-01-11 10:25:02 i can only fit 3 new palettes into allcols
general 2022-01-11 10:30:47 seed
general 2022-01-11 10:35:17 more colour, another unseen variant
general 2022-01-11 10:36:12 water has more colours too
general 2022-01-11 10:36:29 idk how they did the water effect but it's sick
general 2022-01-11 10:36:38 3d running on snes hardware
general 2022-01-11 10:37:13 the original starfox is around 12fps and that uses the slower superfx speed
general 2022-01-11 10:37:59 a patch for starfox 1 was made which bumps the fps to around 20
general 2022-01-11 10:38:11 because it uses the 21mhz mode

general 2022-01-12 13:06:07 infact they're all tyres
general 2022-01-12 13:07:10 it's just calling the shape file
general 2022-01-12 13:08:07 i know nothing about asm bsp but one guy does and managed to convert some test models found in starfox to obj
general 2022-01-12 13:09:43 i have to try this with a stock build just to see if i didn't activate some secret debug feature in the source

general 2022-01-14 13:49:22 it's a rule
general 2022-01-14 13:51:05 (this is referring to messages in a row)
general 2022-01-14 13:54:25 good
general 2022-01-14 13:54:37 you might just get 20fps
general 2022-01-14 13:55:27 around 12 fps if not using the "fast" mode for the superfx
general 2022-01-14 13:56:34 also you need to use superfx for plane crazy because 3d without the superfx on snes is very slow
general 2022-01-14 13:57:21 i mean in link to the past the spinning triforce pieces weren't slow but they're just basic objects
general 2022-01-14 14:05:05 going to try to find the early stunt race textures

general 2022-01-15 13:30:54 as much as i like tilemap studio, it has no support for 16x16 bgs

general 2022-01-19 15:15:06 no more taitania
general 2022-01-19 15:15:15 now it’s proper
general 2022-01-19 15:15:34 idk i’ll see
general 2022-01-19 15:15:56 but i can only fit 3 new palettes in which is not great
general 2022-01-19 15:17:34 allcols.pac in starfox 2 is basically really close to the limit
general 2022-01-19 15:18:57 the starfox 2 palettes all use letters
general 2022-01-19 15:19:27 it's like letter, number
general 2022-01-19 15:20:53 only exceptions to this are col_1.col, col_2.col, and yaji_0.col
general 2022-01-19 15:22:56 taitania is actually the japanese name for titania
general 2022-01-19 15:23:25 so an unfinished translation was shipped with the snes classic
general 2022-01-19 15:23:29 and switch online
general 2022-01-19 15:29:22 earliest transform sounds
general 2022-01-19 15:29:42 including the lock sound

general 2022-01-20 08:35:37 all done
general 2022-01-20 08:37:49 every rip
general 2022-01-20 08:39:09 every track except the underwater theme are edits of the existing spc rips
general 2022-01-20 08:40:13 basically i changed the instrument set used by comparing the underwater rip and the regular rip

general 2022-01-20 22:39:20 wow you are back
general 2022-01-21 07:44:59 so there’s a button combination in the early starfox 2 builds that spawn the boss instantly
general 2022-01-21 07:45:22 guess all my experimentation with mission 6 was useless
general 2022-01-21 07:45:51 but at least i got to see the intended spawn
general 2022-01-21 07:45:55 haven’t tried
general 2022-01-21 07:46:22 it kills you so it’s basically capped at 1
general 2022-01-21 07:46:56 also i should make a full guide to all the starfox 2 ces planet steps
general 2022-01-21 07:47:13 steps determine the layout used
general 2022-01-21 07:48:03 i know meteor step 4 is something like atomic base from starfox 1
general 2022-01-21 07:48:43 every planet has the boss encounter in step 0C
general 2022-01-21 07:51:05 will stream the process of going through every step

general 2022-01-22 12:33:26 close to final though
general 2022-01-22 12:33:49 there are a few differences including louder title music and debug mode

general 2022-01-23 10:38:06 i just realised the closest thing we have to a starfox 2 randomiser is the wces build
general 2022-01-23 10:38:48 because it randomly chooses the step used
general 2022-01-23 10:44:48 oh that's that boss that was unused in the shape files
general 2022-01-23 10:52:37 the rescue

general 2022-01-24 05:58:33 ben shapiro buys a single piece of wood from the home depot is a better game
general 2022-01-24 06:19:17 should i include the battle music in the starfox 2 spc rip
general 2022-01-24 06:19:37 since starfox 2 restoration includes the cut battle mode
general 2022-01-24 07:30:56 i found the forbidden part of the space boss intro

general 2022-01-24 07:51:27 the 100% completion music track was in the game for a while
general 2022-01-24 07:51:31 not spoiling it here
general 2022-01-24 08:58:52 what's happening in jet stream
general 2022-01-24 08:58:58 hi
general 2022-01-24 08:59:14 wtf
general 2022-01-24 09:06:22 wait what lmao
general 2022-01-24 09:08:17 feed it paper
general 2022-01-24 09:58:32 hi
general 2022-01-24 11:02:17 hacked my way into here
general 2022-01-24 11:02:47 and found some surprises
general 2022-01-24 11:03:15 only build here with an intro to the boss intro theme
general 2022-01-24 11:05:29 seed
general 2022-01-24 11:49:01 how is it a bypass
general 2022-01-24 11:49:47 but why
general 2022-01-24 11:49:55 they mean the exact same thing
general 2022-01-24 12:14:04 dead
general 2022-01-24 12:20:11 most people will scroll right to the bottom
general 2022-01-24 12:20:18 so not very effective
general 2022-01-24 12:20:41 very funny
general 2022-01-24 12:23:52 somebody managed to restore battle mode in the starfox 2 restoration hack
general 2022-01-24 12:23:57 not perfect but it's there
general 2022-01-24 12:24:42 and somehow got the ces battle mode tracks into the starfox 2 sound binary format
general 2022-01-24 12:25:11 starfox 2 restoration is a whole hack that adds back the ufo mode, battle mode, and the ces walker spin
general 2022-01-24 12:25:32 what i've been posting is just what i've been doing in my build
general 2022-01-24 12:26:23 you need the precompiled starfox 2 rom for starfox 2 restoration
general 2022-01-24 12:27:52 specifically `SXJ03.COM` from the leak
general 2022-01-24 12:28:22 idk why it's got the dos app extension it's a snes rom
general 2022-01-24 12:28:41 there are issues with starfox 2 restoration
general 2022-01-24 12:31:25 this is what's wrong with the restoration hack, black bg is restoration and white bg is final starfox 2
general 2022-01-24 12:31:40 there's no battery listed
general 2022-01-24 12:31:44 which means no saving
general 2022-01-24 12:34:54 disorder

general 2022-02-27 11:40:30 i have a bunch of early abba cds
general 2022-02-27 11:41:02 should probably crosscheck them with the discogs database

general 2022-02-27 11:47:08 also my copy of voulez-vous by abba is from 1984 (one of the first cd releases of the album)
general 2022-02-27 11:48:48 it's even got an overview of cds in the inlay

general 2022-03-07 13:20:28 getting close
general 2022-03-07 13:34:36 should i ditch the yellow and go straight to the blue and green
general 2022-03-07 13:45:25 i'm quite happy with that
general 2022-03-07 13:45:44 no
general 2022-03-07 13:45:53 making a new palette for the andross battle
general 2022-03-07 13:46:27 i tried to do it with yellow but didn't work
general 2022-03-07 13:46:35 would've loved to have yellow and blue
general 2022-03-07 13:46:58 but sf2 andross inspired colours are alright

general 2022-03-07 14:03:55 ok well
general 2022-03-07 14:03:59 i have to do green now
general 2022-03-07 14:04:12 yellow just won't work in the 15 colour limit
general 2022-03-07 14:04:46 either the blending will look jarring or it won't "fade" into the bg colour
general 2022-03-07 14:10:33 need that chair

general 2022-03-07 14:39:01 the amount of palettes in this one file is insane
general 2022-03-07 14:39:11 all for separate bgs
general 2022-03-07 14:39:42 i can't use the bottom half of the palette btw
general 2022-03-07 14:40:18 i've got a very early starfox 2 bg in there, new andross battle, and a city bg in the one file
general 2022-03-07 14:40:45 just as great as the one i did for the vortex bgs
general 2022-03-07 14:42:13 the vortex one still has the most palettes i've crammed into 1 file
general 2022-03-07 14:42:46 i forgot i did the early titania bg

general 2022-03-15 12:05:28 it's unhealthy
general 2022-03-15 12:05:32 delete the game
general 2022-03-15 12:05:51 ^
general 2022-03-15 12:06:01 load up some emulators

general 2022-03-15 12:06:40 <@!622607246257422356> see if your new pc can handle virtua racing or starblade without any lag
general 2022-03-15 12:08:10 forgot i had these snes documents
general 2022-03-15 12:08:31 prototypes + emulator
general 2022-03-15 12:09:00 actually?
general 2022-03-15 12:09:22 also i should probably upload these docs to a more easier to get place
general 2022-03-15 12:09:40 they were posted to assemblergames but forums died
general 2022-03-15 12:10:35 there are many near final prototypes you can get at https://hiddenpalace.org/ <@!622607246257422356>

general 2022-03-15 12:18:08 the program i use to view snes graphics (h-cg-cad) was directly built off of the s-cg-cad design documents as well as the ones left with srdcad
general 2022-03-15 12:21:13 the srdcad ones are meant for the gba formats (sch, scl, sob, ssc, spl, smp), but they're all based off of the old snes formats
general 2022-03-15 12:21:29 he just wants to spend time away from the internet
general 2022-03-15 12:21:39 and i understand that

general 2022-03-26 05:56:45 whitename or not, he’s got a point
general 2022-03-26 05:58:04 but why say simp for a fictional character
general 2022-03-26 06:01:06 nothing wrong with being a weeb, but simping for a fictional character is a problem
general 2022-03-26 06:04:33 he doesn’t watch anime
general 2022-03-26 06:04:58 probably not interested in that series either
general 2022-03-26 06:07:19 springtrapkiller has a nsfw anime hoodie and refuses to get rid of it (not good)

general 2022-03-26 06:10:37 it’s more sad than anything
general 2022-03-26 06:16:58 think about it, you wasted money on a nsfw anime hoodie

general 2022-03-26 11:07:37 just like the slot machine special stage in sonic 3
general 2022-03-26 11:07:48 you never get jackpot
general 2022-03-26 11:08:24 acts of god
general 2022-03-26 11:09:36 also i have no clue what the source of this image is i just stole it from ssnc
general 2022-03-26 11:18:05 skill issue
general 2022-03-26 11:18:38 because i just got it first try
general 2022-03-26 11:20:44 oh yeah i thought that sonic slot gif came from 3d blast so i looked in the prototype section and found this really great render
general 2022-03-26 11:20:49 nothing wrong here
general 2022-03-26 11:22:59 the slot gif is based off the final 3d blast render
general 2022-03-26 11:23:48 remember 9_sf3 has 2 fridges
general 2022-03-26 11:25:39 no
general 2022-03-26 11:25:49 yes
general 2022-03-26 11:26:16 he is also the worst player
general 2022-03-26 11:26:51 i have played all 3 arcade daytona usa games on real machines
general 2022-03-26 11:27:49 if you want to play daytona usa best way to play it is on a real machine
general 2022-03-26 11:27:54 it's the full experience
general 2022-03-26 11:28:17 the special 8 player setup is even better
general 2022-03-26 11:28:20 of course
general 2022-03-26 11:28:39 since it has a moving seat

general 2022-03-26 11:32:08 (very important)
general 2022-03-26 11:32:35 that's fine
general 2022-03-26 11:32:39 no need for timeout
general 2022-03-26 11:32:51 bus driving

general 2022-03-26 11:57:36 yousuf's favourite pastime
general 2022-03-26 11:59:14 2nd favourite then
general 2022-03-26 11:59:46 yousuf is a racist and loves throwing chairs at elderly women
general 2022-03-26 12:00:24 no
general 2022-03-26 12:00:29 he's too good
general 2022-03-26 12:33:07 no way
general 2022-03-26 12:34:32 literally one of the best tracks from sonic cd but the mixed version sounds worse than the unmixed one
general 2022-03-26 12:35:18 i want the prototype one in lossless but don't know where to find it and can't be bothered to rip it
general 2022-03-26 12:55:56 and i found it
general 2022-03-26 12:58:13 i got the prototype title theme too
general 2022-03-26 13:22:24 the full palmtree panic zone present experience (you need to loop it)
general 2022-03-26 13:23:44 guy still here
general 2022-03-26 14:30:07 was going to do one more but got bored
general 2022-03-26 14:30:08 have to loop it to understand the difference
general 2022-03-26 14:30:13 should i still do it
general 2022-03-26 14:30:40 i was going to choose metallic madness present or stardust speedway present
general 2022-03-27 05:07:56 tell him to get rid of his nsfw anime hoodie
general 2022-03-27 05:08:07 it's for his own good
general 2022-03-27 05:15:29 calling it now, there will be issues with builds being lost just like the 30+ lost nintendo sony NeWS workstation backups
general 2022-03-27 05:16:15 you swear
general 2022-03-27 05:17:18 what's the point
general 2022-03-27 05:19:03 honestly forgot about splatoon 3
general 2022-03-27 05:19:26 i played splatoon 2 on launch day but stopped playing a few years ago
general 2022-03-27 05:21:37 i bring more full experiences
general 2022-03-27 05:21:41 (have to loop it to understand)
general 2022-03-27 05:23:27 rick what's the situation with speakers now? when i put the universe id in it doesn't give access to plane crazy
general 2022-03-27 05:23:54 (relates to my old suggestion about pitch modulation)
general 2022-03-27 05:24:47 2 sheets of metal and cut them to resemble some sort of blade
general 2022-03-27 05:24:51 idfk
general 2022-03-27 05:25:05 double sided knife
general 2022-03-27 05:25:26 (very smart and useful)
general 2022-03-27 05:25:34 he is not
general 2022-03-27 05:26:19 he will not add a female assistant to plane crazy for that reason
general 2022-03-27 05:26:49 i know he won't add it
general 2022-03-27 05:27:44 because he only adds useful stuff
general 2022-03-27 05:28:03 for what
general 2022-03-27 05:29:22 9_sf3 really expects rickje to add a full ai to a roblox game
general 2022-03-27 05:30:07 that's something that was made for fun
general 2022-03-27 05:30:34 no, but he won't put in a shitload of effort to make something useless
general 2022-03-27 05:31:21 the useless stuff in pc is just made for fun
general 2022-03-27 05:31:53 not meant to be some high effort feature
general 2022-03-27 05:32:56 you know he can give building tips in game without making a full assistant
general 2022-03-27 05:33:02 it's called a simple menu tab
general 2022-03-27 05:34:43 also almost every assistant in operating systems is annoying and inconvenient
general 2022-03-27 05:34:53 nobody wants to use cortana
general 2022-03-27 05:34:55 or siri
general 2022-03-27 05:35:17 yes
general 2022-03-27 05:35:38 9_sf3's idea is a menu tab with a character attached to it
general 2022-03-27 05:36:19 just quicker to read the information and get straight into it
general 2022-03-27 05:36:38 
general 2022-03-27 05:36:54 ask 9_sf3
general 2022-03-27 05:38:18 honestly sounds like something i would get in a great image
general 2022-03-27 05:39:05 but can't they just read it and look at pictures
general 2022-03-27 05:39:11 in a menu tab
general 2022-03-27 05:40:00 he's got a point
general 2022-03-27 05:40:44 not perfect but he's got the right idea
general 2022-03-27 05:40:47 holy shit
general 2022-03-27 05:40:51 hi inventer
general 2022-03-27 05:45:56 
general 2022-03-27 05:46:17 from sonic cd
general 2022-03-27 05:46:21 i fixed it
general 2022-03-27 05:46:35 (you will understand if you loop it)
general 2022-03-27 05:47:03 because in regular sonic cd there's a gap when the track finishes and reloads
general 2022-03-27 05:47:15 and there were unused loops to fill the gap
general 2022-03-27 05:47:26 here's the qqz present one
general 2022-03-27 05:47:52 stardust speedway zone present
general 2022-03-27 05:48:15 to think these are being pushed out of something like the spc700
general 2022-03-27 05:50:30 no just 3
general 2022-03-27 05:50:31 no days
general 2022-03-27 05:50:33 just 3
general 2022-03-27 05:50:52 months
general 2022-03-27 05:51:15 oh yeah just 3
general 2022-03-27 05:52:37 why the fuck did they remove these loops in the final
general 2022-03-27 05:52:38 it makes the tracks sound full
general 2022-03-27 06:16:00 all of those are shit
general 2022-03-27 06:16:06 utorrent is terrible
general 2022-03-27 06:16:28 just use youtube-dlg
general 2022-03-27 06:16:41 and pirate bay is not trustworthy at all
general 2022-03-27 06:34:35 what one
general 2022-03-27 06:34:52 sick
general 2022-03-27 06:35:09 i literally have one that's almost the same
general 2022-03-27 06:35:16 but it's a little unit
general 2022-03-27 06:35:19 toshiba one right?
general 2022-03-27 06:36:18 this is what i have (picture found online)
general 2022-03-27 06:37:02 i don't want to use it though since i feel like it'll put a lot of pressure on my records
general 2022-03-27 06:37:19 i have lots of original abba releases
general 2022-03-27 06:38:14 sadly all blank cassettes today are just the regular type 1 tape
general 2022-03-27 06:38:25 i still have a sealed pack
general 2022-03-27 06:38:28 from like the 90s
general 2022-03-27 06:39:26 3 pack of blank tdk type 1 tapes
general 2022-03-27 06:39:32 i have 2 walkmans
general 2022-03-27 06:40:16 only one works atm since the belt got really warped
general 2022-03-27 06:40:46 if you want a walkman i suggest getting belts too
general 2022-03-27 06:40:50 and a service guide
general 2022-03-27 06:41:23 i already have medium grade setup
general 2022-03-27 06:41:38 coolest thing i have is a really early cd player from the 80s
general 2022-03-27 06:42:45 idk like i always want to get the highest quality possible
general 2022-03-27 06:42:51 so sort of
general 2022-03-27 06:43:04 but then again i don't have an audiophile-grade setup
general 2022-03-27 06:43:34 alright good
general 2022-03-27 06:44:31 it's just a kenwood hifi from the early 90s
general 2022-03-27 06:44:47 used to have a teac hifi from the 80's but broke a long time ago
general 2022-03-27 06:46:23 yes
general 2022-03-27 06:46:27 it's essential
general 2022-03-27 06:47:14 i have a shitty boombox from the 80s with a broken cassette deck but i just keep it because of the look
general 2022-03-27 06:48:37 small mid 80s system
general 2022-03-27 06:52:35 the cd player <@!925391831603232800>

general 2022-03-27 06:55:00 (my rare 70s demo tape is there)

general 2022-03-29 02:05:14 there's gyro aiming
general 2022-03-29 02:05:19 as well as splatoon 2
general 2022-03-29 02:05:31 i don't use gyro aiming though lol
general 2022-03-29 02:05:36 never liked it
general 2022-03-29 02:06:38 only gyro aiming i like is the gyro in pikmin 3 deluxe
general 2022-03-29 02:06:55 since i can play the game as intended
general 2022-03-29 02:07:19 do not use stick aiming for pikmin
general 2022-03-29 02:07:33 wii remote is the best for pikmin games
general 2022-03-29 02:07:44 gyro is the 2nd best
general 2022-03-29 02:08:47 is there analog support?
general 2022-03-29 02:09:07 there should be when using a controller
general 2022-03-29 02:10:01 rick
general 2022-03-29 02:10:12 we need pitch modulation on speakers
general 2022-03-29 02:10:18 done with keybinds
general 2022-03-29 02:10:24 when build is spawned
general 2022-03-29 02:10:45 as well as volume control
general 2022-03-29 02:11:11 would be better for cars
general 2022-03-29 02:11:15 no we don't
general 2022-03-29 02:12:21 adding to this there should be a cap to it
general 2022-03-29 02:12:29 like you can set a cap
general 2022-03-29 02:13:00 and the rate should be able to be changed
general 2022-03-29 02:13:53 and the same thing could be applied to motors as well, instead of instantaneous speed there's a gradual rise
general 2022-03-29 02:14:29 no

general 2022-03-29 11:32:05 watch out
general 2022-03-29 11:32:14 no
general 2022-03-29 11:32:44 they may have barrier technology but it only restricts people getting out
general 2022-03-29 11:33:18 so that means you can nuke indonesia and it'll keep the radiation inside
general 2022-03-29 11:34:35 can't do that
general 2022-03-29 11:34:45 they're currently doing good things
general 2022-03-29 11:34:55 (hard to believe)
general 2022-03-29 11:35:02 they bombed philippines though
general 2022-03-29 11:35:05 that's a good thing
general 2022-03-29 11:35:30 and they have a list of other countries to bomb in south-east asia
general 2022-03-29 11:35:56 target 5 of the french
general 2022-03-29 11:36:03 target 2 is indonesia
general 2022-03-29 11:36:10 target 3 is thailand
general 2022-03-29 11:36:16 target 4 is malaysia

general 2022-04-11 10:09:42 if you think an ipad air is heavy then there's something very wrong
general 2022-04-11 10:11:47 since i've used an ipad 2 for 2 years and never thought it was heavy

general 2022-04-11 14:38:41 not directly though, there's a long process to get it into a usable state
general 2022-04-11 14:39:06 sorry
general 2022-04-11 14:39:26 basically custom music in starfox is real now
general 2022-04-11 14:39:52 and we have a special version of a snes music program to help make them
general 2022-04-11 14:40:55 i've never touched the editor of it but it looks similar to trackers

general 2022-04-14 00:13:57 there’s pc2 coming soon (hopefully), so there’s almost no point to build anything in the current version
general 2022-04-14 00:14:28 doubt it
general 2022-04-14 00:14:36 but it would be insane
general 2022-04-14 00:15:04 actually i think rick talked about the plot size in pc2
general 2022-04-14 00:17:57 the man himself comes here and corrects the statement

general 2022-04-14 10:22:45 how did it become the nuclear place (can’t be answered)
general 2022-04-14 10:22:55 hi gamma
general 2022-04-14 10:23:39 the consequences of damaging manchester

general 2022-04-14 13:50:55 undeniable fact
general 2022-04-14 13:51:22 megadrive had a lot of parallax and fm synth
general 2022-04-14 13:51:32 sega dreamcast i think
general 2022-04-14 13:54:31 the snes had lots of colour potential (256 colour palettes!), and a sampler
general 2022-04-14 13:55:56 quick
general 2022-04-14 13:55:59 what did he post
general 2022-04-14 13:57:05 wait is he on his 3rd?

general 2022-04-14 14:02:15 how it was rendered
general 2022-04-14 14:05:03 <@925391831603232800> rerendered this povray scene from the irtc in 4k a while ago
general 2022-04-14 14:05:27 idk what it is
general 2022-04-14 14:05:31 but it's a cool render
general 2022-04-14 14:05:57 authentic render from 1995 iirc
general 2022-04-14 14:07:31 yeah there have been ip loggers like that
general 2022-04-14 14:07:46 also really have to get started on the proper starfox 2 spc rip
general 2022-04-14 14:07:51 tagged and all
general 2022-04-14 14:08:07 no it's an ip logger and a token logger
general 2022-04-14 14:11:40 the forbidden screenshot (limited release)
general 2022-04-14 14:12:11 no more
general 2022-04-14 14:28:59 yousuf might know
general 2022-04-14 14:30:25 send them to manchester that nuclear place
general 2022-04-14 14:30:32 they will never return
general 2022-04-15 01:07:28 he's got a point
general 2022-04-15 01:08:54 seed this was 11 days ago
general 2022-04-15 06:29:59 the guy who made that video was once here and always complained about roleplay
general 2022-04-15 06:30:24 and how some people were overdramatic or some shit

general 2022-04-15 12:08:08 despite it being almost 2 years after the 99er falken incident (holy shit)
general 2022-04-15 12:08:26 that happened in 2002
general 2022-04-15 12:08:32 it's now 2004
general 2022-04-15 12:10:08 no
general 2022-04-15 12:10:11 sorry
general 2022-04-15 12:10:34 still celebrating after the death of 9_sf3
general 2022-04-15 12:10:47 yeah
general 2022-04-15 12:10:54 very cringe
general 2022-04-15 12:14:40 honestly idk
general 2022-04-15 12:32:42 yeah madattak made the initial version, then passed ownership to rickje
general 2022-04-15 12:33:11 don't know the details of it but that's what happened
general 2022-04-15 12:34:43 this is important
general 2022-04-15 12:35:15 good
general 2022-04-15 12:36:08 novas is way better
general 2022-04-15 12:36:13 it has the quality
general 2022-04-15 12:36:15 it has the tunes
general 2022-04-15 12:40:14 how do you own the executor
general 2022-04-15 12:40:55 that's what i thought
general 2022-04-15 12:41:10 i own the trade federation battleship in lego star wars
general 2022-04-15 12:58:10 that’s what we all do

general 2022-04-15 14:12:57 vlc mobile
general 2022-04-15 14:13:07 just listen to the file on vlc mobile
general 2022-04-15 14:13:13 doesn't download it iirc
general 2022-04-15 14:13:24 🧠
general 2022-04-15 14:13:49 how the fuck did you not know he was referring to the virus
general 2022-04-15 14:14:32 i just uploaded mp3s sorry (lame files according to file explorer)
general 2022-04-15 14:15:53 wav superiority
general 2022-04-15 14:17:17 wav is better because it's the default conversion format in foobar (no need to go through another menu)
general 2022-04-15 14:17:35 good
general 2022-04-15 14:20:20 ok
general 2022-04-15 14:22:22 what's yousuf doing
general 2022-04-15 14:22:34 code
general 2022-04-15 14:22:35 nice
general 2022-04-15 14:23:52 yousu
general 2022-04-15 14:25:14 love the cube
general 2022-04-15 14:25:40 he's revving as well
general 2022-04-15 14:25:43 did you hear that
general 2022-04-15 14:27:23 9f cereal
general 2022-04-15 14:28:27 yousuf actually knows something while i just change random shit in the asm or .mc files and hope it works
general 2022-04-15 14:29:02 if it's wrong i change it and rebuild it
general 2022-04-15 14:29:14 ok cool
general 2022-04-15 14:30:13 i'll try to see if i can find my really unfinished hack that attempted to bring back the alpha hud
general 2022-04-15 14:30:29 made a sick custom palette for scramble text though
general 2022-04-15 14:40:50 <@922071148739563541> said that
general 2022-04-15 14:45:42 i can't find the source of the alpha hud build
general 2022-04-15 14:46:05 this is where my terrible folder organisation affects me
general 2022-04-15 14:53:28 i have an idea on how to find it
general 2022-04-15 14:54:00 i search for obj-1.ccr and look for stuff dated early 2021 or 23/12/2022
general 2022-04-15 14:54:21 most likely 23/12/2022
general 2022-04-15 14:55:17 or a specific .mc file i forgot the name of
general 2022-04-15 15:15:32 holy shit i found it
general 2022-04-15 15:16:03 this is the one
general 2022-04-15 15:18:32 iirc i had lots of issues with the boss health bar so i scrapped it
general 2022-04-15 15:18:46 the way it renders is one problem
general 2022-04-15 15:20:41 ok so it's all there but the title is different
general 2022-04-15 15:20:45 the source is not lost
general 2022-04-15 15:20:46 good
general 2022-04-15 15:21:45 the one file
general 2022-04-15 15:22:17 polish i think
general 2022-04-15 15:24:00 here's a little piece of the title screen the build has (unrelated to alpha hud)
general 2022-04-15 15:29:56 streaming abandoned hud hack (will be broken in some stages)
general 2022-04-15 15:30:17 actually i think most stages don't have the modified palette lmao
general 2022-04-15 15:36:14 one of the broken ones
general 2022-04-15 15:36:19 that's not great
general 2022-04-15 15:37:32 hi gamma
general 2022-04-15 15:43:54 another unseen number in the alpha
general 2022-04-15 15:44:12 every stage in the alpha build has stage 2 as the text
general 2022-04-15 15:46:59 i've literally never played sf64 so idk
general 2022-04-15 15:47:19 i've only played the 2 snes games
general 2022-04-15 15:48:52 one of the best venom variants
general 2022-04-15 15:49:01 found another bug
general 2022-04-15 15:49:20 layer 3 is very jittery
general 2022-04-15 15:54:31 janky build finished
general 2022-04-15 15:55:13 it was an experience
general 2022-04-15 15:55:52 some guy

general 2022-04-16 08:01:55 it just is
general 2022-04-16 08:03:52 
general 2022-04-16 08:04:32 (need to know)
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:45:58 what
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:46:15 that's the bot
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:46:24 not dyno warns
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:46:37 dyno warns only count
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:47:06 i think if you have a certain amounts of auto warns action is taken but idk
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:47:34 oh yeah
bot-central 2022-04-16 09:48:25 now you just ghost pinged yousuf 🧠
general 2022-04-16 09:48:47 no asking
general 2022-04-16 09:48:57 see
general 2022-04-16 09:53:17 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/956568555619495948/964821013391085568/sf2_meteor_full.gif
general 2022-04-16 09:53:54 i don't know how they got the blue tinge in the meteor tunnel
general 2022-04-16 09:54:18 i looked at the palette in mesen-s and couldn't see any shifting with the model palette
general 2022-04-16 09:54:36 did find how it works though
general 2022-04-16 09:55:43 i honestly can't find how they did it
general 2022-04-16 09:55:46 is it hdma?
general 2022-04-16 09:58:53 i don't do snes stuff that often
general 2022-04-16 09:59:00 only ever so often
general 2022-04-16 09:59:36 i wish, preservation is important
general 2022-04-16 10:00:31 mate daytona is a classic
general 2022-04-16 10:00:35 can't deny it
general 2022-04-16 10:00:56 that was in the 80s
general 2022-04-16 10:01:25 a small resurgence in the 90s with virtua racing, daytona usa and many others
general 2022-04-16 10:01:59 daytona usa 2 had incredible graphics in 1998
general 2022-04-16 10:03:25 it did eventually
general 2022-04-16 10:03:50 graphics were the main pull factor
general 2022-04-16 10:03:57 and consoles caught up
general 2022-04-16 10:04:09 https://youtu.be/Gp-hMCUT9F0 released in 1998
general 2022-04-16 10:05:09 like ps1 was still in full force in 1998
general 2022-04-16 10:07:28 https://youtu.be/AEeLaDga56A this was released back in 1991, close to the start of the snes lifecycle
general 2022-04-16 10:08:11 starfox didn't come out until early 1993
general 2022-04-16 10:08:51 the earliest prototype of starfox that is available online is from 1992, no specific time but i presume mid 1992
general 2022-04-16 10:09:55 literally
general 2022-04-16 10:11:19 many people thought that starfox was fake 3d, which is honestly stupid since it would be way too much effort
general 2022-04-16 10:12:01 but the source code proved otherwise, real 3d models are used and divided between various shape files
general 2022-04-16 10:13:32 the format originally used for them was amiga videoscape, but they went through a conversion process in shaped that produced an asm bsp file (used in the game)
general 2022-04-16 10:14:01 i know way too much about starfox holy shit
general 2022-04-16 10:14:19 i only do the graphics, no modelling at all
general 2022-04-16 10:14:48 can't be bothered
general 2022-04-16 10:15:07 also no skill at video producing (i literally only make live sports)
general 2022-04-16 10:26:34 i want to say more but i don't really want to send lots of messages about starfox shit that nobody cares about
general 2022-04-16 10:27:07 yousuf cares a bit but that's all i know
general 2022-04-16 10:29:20 music binaries are still mainly a mystery and current ones being produced are very hacky, graphics are all compressed in many different files (makes it a pain to look through the prototype rom)
general 2022-04-16 10:29:25 that's about it
general 2022-04-16 10:30:17 oh and it uses a custom scripting language
general 2022-04-16 11:39:17 intended solution
general 2022-04-16 11:41:11 good point
general 2022-04-16 11:41:36 already did
general 2022-04-16 11:44:55 i only used the codes for secret characters
general 2022-04-16 11:45:00 the holiday ones
general 2022-04-16 14:49:22 it's stupid
general 2022-04-16 14:49:51 just play the game with the intended look
general 2022-04-17 03:33:44 yeah they don’t
the-dump 2022-04-17 06:00:16 what

general 2022-04-29 12:00:05 when did that happen
general 2022-04-29 12:58:15 i've played all 3 daytona usa games on real cabinets
general 2022-04-29 12:59:08 playing with the original wheel is way different and better than playing with an emulator
general 2022-04-29 12:59:35 now final step is to somehow play virtua racing on a real cab
general 2022-04-29 13:05:13 i have never gotten tiktok and i don't plan on it
general 2022-04-29 13:08:25 launch day snes models had way more chips and are apparently more prone to failure
general 2022-04-29 13:10:04 and had a dedicated module for the apu
general 2022-04-29 13:10:40 no someone sent a photo of one in the starfox server
general 2022-04-29 13:10:57 and i was interested
general 2022-04-29 13:11:58 i already know about the later 1chip models and the early models, but didn't know they had a removable apu
general 2022-04-29 13:12:13 gone
general 2022-04-29 13:14:37 i wonder how the earliest sfc prototype looked like inside, considering the famicom module was already shown off
general 2022-04-29 13:14:49 it would've had different hardware
general 2022-04-29 13:15:19 because it is
general 2022-04-29 13:15:37 yeah they planned a famicom module for the snes very early on
general 2022-04-29 13:15:48 as well as a headphone jack
general 2022-04-29 13:16:01 yeah rocket league is on switch
general 2022-04-29 13:16:11 are you using emulator
general 2022-04-29 13:16:17 steam version
general 2022-04-29 13:16:20 or mobile
general 2022-04-29 13:16:23 yeah it's free
general 2022-04-29 13:16:37 where is it crashing
general 2022-04-29 13:16:48 shit
general 2022-04-29 13:17:24 maybe search it up, i have never played the steam version
general 2022-04-29 13:17:27 only mobile
general 2022-04-29 13:17:32 rocket league
general 2022-04-29 13:17:46 i have it on ps4 but never played
general 2022-04-29 13:19:16 ok so the spc chip was at the very beginning
general 2022-04-29 13:19:18 8 channels
general 2022-04-29 13:19:19 samples
general 2022-04-29 13:19:39 well it's not just a chip, it's a series of chips
general 2022-04-29 13:20:42 how
general 2022-04-29 13:20:47 sorry wrong reply
general 2022-04-29 13:21:10 they thought mario will go to space
general 2022-04-29 13:21:17 well he did but in a different game
general 2022-04-29 13:21:31 super mario land 2
general 2022-04-29 13:21:41 he did not go to space in super mario world
general 2022-04-29 13:22:14 also this is a japanese article so they say zelda games came on disks
general 2022-04-29 13:22:32 yeah he does in those games
general 2022-04-29 13:22:40 it's all based around space and gravity
general 2022-04-29 13:22:58 but super mario land 2 was the first time mario went to space iirc
general 2022-04-29 13:23:05 he went to the moon
general 2022-04-29 13:24:19 8bpp was at the start
general 2022-04-29 13:25:39 the translation was butchered by google translate but the 8 graphics modes were there
general 2022-04-29 13:25:44 mode 0 - 7
general 2022-04-29 13:27:57 mentions of the famicom adapter
general 2022-04-29 13:29:21 the famicom adapter would've been a stripped down famicom that only has the essential components
general 2022-04-29 13:29:36 video output would be through the sfc
general 2022-04-29 13:34:57 we got this
general 2022-04-29 13:35:13 from a source
general 2022-04-29 13:35:53 this is actually a very early version of pilotwings
general 2022-04-29 13:35:59 it was way different
general 2022-04-29 13:37:05 from what graphics are left (which is basically almost everything), it used to have bosses and a wide variety of maps
general 2022-04-29 13:37:19 as well as the craft in the screenshot

general 2022-05-02 11:12:29 common sense

general 2022-05-02 11:15:10 you literally haven't read the channel thoroughly then
general 2022-05-02 11:15:19 since there is a huge list of ranks

general 2022-05-02 13:28:30 as well as the venom lightning
general 2022-05-02 14:06:20 hardcoded palettes
general 2022-05-02 14:06:25 very fun to work with

general 2022-05-11 10:17:52 from 2003
general 2022-05-11 10:17:59 (last year)
general 2022-05-11 12:30:32 i did the entire palette wrong
general 2022-05-11 12:30:41 now i have to redo the whole process
general 2022-05-11 12:31:10 starting from comparing the colours between the 2bpp version and the colours in the palette organiser
general 2022-05-11 12:31:34 all while looking at the original tilemap to see what goes where
general 2022-05-11 12:32:20 hopefully it'll go well
general 2022-05-11 12:32:26 never homebrewed anything
general 2022-05-11 12:33:14 oh shit

general 2022-05-11 12:34:29 valuable item
general 2022-05-11 12:34:41 we are cracking the code to the titania palette fade
general 2022-05-11 12:35:17 mist.col was referenced in the starfox source
general 2022-05-11 12:36:00 and so far we worked out that pallen means the amount of colours it needs to fade
general 2022-05-11 12:36:02 i think
general 2022-05-11 12:37:35 we were talking about using hardcoded palettes to save precious allcol.pac space and then it went off topic
general 2022-05-11 12:37:51 (the line limit in allcol is 255)
general 2022-05-11 12:38:06 and the entire base game has to be preserved
general 2022-05-11 12:43:40 it is all happening
general 2022-05-11 12:43:47 all of it

general 2022-05-12 12:03:02 with that time i would be 2nd on speedrun.com virtua racing
general 2022-05-12 12:03:12 really close to first
general 2022-05-12 12:39:47 i was a bit racist today
general 2022-05-12 12:39:50 <@370594904268734464> the moment of realisation
general 2022-05-12 12:39:51 just a bit
general 2022-05-12 12:40:55 totally didn’t smash my pb
general 2022-05-12 12:41:31 the lap wasn’t looking that great but the ending made up for the mistakes
general 2022-05-12 12:52:54 virtua racing
general 2022-05-12 12:53:13 not crazy taxi
general 2022-05-12 12:53:32 completely different objective
general 2022-05-12 12:53:38 and system
general 2022-05-12 12:54:05 (i've literally never played crazy taxi and kind of want to)
general 2022-05-12 12:54:18 i don't want the mobile port
general 2022-05-12 12:54:52 and the arcade board it's on is probably more resource intensive to emulate
general 2022-05-13 02:18:43 wireless earbuds
general 2022-05-13 02:18:51 i want a good pair of headphones
general 2022-05-13 02:19:07 no just apple earbuds

general 2022-05-13 02:28:12 idk my current earbuds are alright, it's just a thought
general 2022-05-13 02:30:14 no you can get really nice stuff for way less
general 2022-05-13 02:30:42 1k headphones do exist but are so not worth it
general 2022-05-13 02:34:42 the apple earbuds are actually decent
general 2022-05-13 02:35:05 most earbuds i've experienced sound shit
general 2022-05-13 02:35:19 fine for me
general 2022-05-13 02:36:58 wired superiority

general 2022-05-18 12:38:26 whatever i feel like doing i guess lol
general 2022-05-18 12:39:51 my graphics stuff used to be a pain because i used nintendo's shitty internal tool
general 2022-05-18 12:40:37 it crashes after 8 tilemaps, had to assemble a map made of 64 tilemaps

general 2022-05-18 15:07:47 wait holy shit i just realised you're back
general 2022-05-18 15:08:21 lmao
general 2022-05-18 15:08:29 how did i not notice
general 2022-05-18 15:08:54 none of us play plane crazy anymore
general 2022-05-18 15:09:07 only a few people
general 2022-05-18 15:09:12 still play
general 2022-05-18 15:09:31 but vast majority of people from 2020 don't play anymore
general 2022-05-18 15:09:45 or play very little
general 2022-05-18 15:09:52 yes it is
general 2022-05-19 00:58:58 no
general 2022-05-19 01:00:34 i don't have money on steam
general 2022-05-19 01:00:48 or use steam much at all
general 2022-05-19 08:56:06 yousuf
general 2022-05-19 08:56:14 i found the mode 7 graphics
general 2022-05-19 08:56:19 hi gamma
general 2022-05-19 08:56:41 currently winning
general 2022-05-19 08:56:51 i can now make it dragonfly
general 2022-05-19 08:57:20 sorry for the terrible palette i can't be bothered to load up a palette file
general 2022-05-19 08:57:28 sort of
general 2022-05-19 08:57:45 i try to restore unused assets
general 2022-05-19 08:58:48 ?
general 2022-05-19 08:59:32 because i have the original files
general 2022-05-19 08:59:41 basically all of them
general 2022-05-19 08:59:58 but they're not in a usable state in pilotwings
general 2022-05-19 09:00:47 because there is no source code public, and some of the sprites are still in the art stage
general 2022-05-19 09:01:33 so they often lack certain sprites or have to be modified to fit in
general 2022-05-19 09:01:36 yes
general 2022-05-19 09:02:39 well you can't really restore it, but the sprites that are there can potentially be included
general 2022-05-19 09:03:44 the early biplanes don't conform to the way pilotwings calls the sprites, the crash frames are missing or very crude
general 2022-05-19 09:06:16 for pilotwings i compare the information gathered from the files with the final game, and see if there is a counterpart (or i look at https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1989Q3.html for levels and stuff)
general 2022-05-19 09:06:23 the rest is just pure speculation
general 2022-05-19 09:07:03 but stuff like titles and menus are quite obvious
general 2022-05-19 09:08:34 yychr default
general 2022-05-19 09:08:38 it's so great
general 2022-05-19 09:09:01 but i accidentally replaced a line with something else
general 2022-05-19 09:10:05 now that's better
general 2022-05-19 09:11:56 for pilotwings expert i might replace the title screen with the dragonfly 1989 one (which is what i have as the regular title currently), and replace the regular with the later title screen
general 2022-05-19 09:19:02 demo flight with the early plane
general 2022-05-19 10:48:08 _ _
general 2022-05-19 10:48:43 idk where to start with mode 7 tilemaps
general 2022-05-19 10:49:02 but i put in part of the dragonfly logo as a test
general 2022-05-19 10:52:58 i want this in
general 2022-05-19 10:53:11 but can't atm because idk mode 7 tilemaps
general 2022-05-19 11:19:54 the helicopter stages start on a boat like dragonfly
general 2022-05-19 11:19:58 wow what a coincidence
general 2022-05-19 11:20:19 totally not just the dragonfly gameplay recycled
general 2022-05-19 14:02:35 wired superiority
general 2022-05-19 14:03:25 good

general 2022-05-20 11:36:37 fun fact about pilotwings, 3 maps are basically copied over from dragonfly
general 2022-05-20 11:36:41 with some changes
general 2022-05-20 11:37:15 the whole helicopter part was just an excuse to use the existing dragonfly gameplay

general 2022-06-03 14:53:42 the whole thing
general 2022-06-03 14:53:46 except the source code
general 2022-06-03 14:53:59 there was that huge nintendo leak in 2020
general 2022-06-03 14:54:06 this was one of the things leaked
general 2022-06-03 14:54:21 as well as the full sources for starfox 1 and 2
general 2022-06-03 14:54:39 oh god
general 2022-06-03 14:55:05 i've edited the starfox 1 and 2 sources to add different backgrounds
general 2022-06-03 14:55:35 this was one of them
general 2022-06-03 14:56:18 as well as this
general 2022-06-03 14:56:34 yes
general 2022-06-03 14:56:48 the early background was so much better than the final one
general 2022-06-03 14:57:09 but the music used for it was blown away by the final build
general 2022-06-03 14:58:20 i also fixed the translation of starfox 2
general 2022-06-03 14:58:26 the official english build
general 2022-06-03 14:58:57 finally perfect

general 2022-06-03 15:01:58 idk why one's a wav and the other is an mp3
general 2022-06-03 15:02:53 they take them down and don't bother releasing them
general 2022-06-03 15:02:54 wtf
general 2022-06-03 15:03:21 i can understand why sega did that with khinsider a while back since they were officially released albums
general 2022-06-03 15:04:10 full version of astropolis from the wces build
general 2022-06-03 15:05:58 also a track that was previously unheard in an early starfox 2 build as the game crashes whenever andross speaks on the map
general 2022-06-03 15:06:10 the full version of the space boss intro
general 2022-06-03 15:06:45 the space theme for battle mode was also in that build oddly
general 2022-06-03 15:07:12 had to do a bit of hacking in memory to get to the test menu and config
general 2022-06-03 15:07:39 literally
general 2022-06-03 15:09:00 official build date is june 8 1995
general 2022-06-03 15:10:22 also includes a very early version of the credits sequence

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 09:50:36 very smart
general 2022-06-04 10:10:51 ok
general 2022-06-04 10:11:21 very good
general 2022-06-04 10:11:30 best computer
general 2022-06-04 10:12:40 oh sick
general 2022-06-04 10:12:43 original model
general 2022-06-04 10:13:09 wait which ds models do you have?
general 2022-06-04 10:13:43 basically almost all of them iirc
general 2022-06-04 10:14:55 make a free account to change how you look
general 2022-06-04 10:14:58 i remember this
general 2022-06-04 10:15:24 cex
general 2022-06-04 10:17:04 might actually be possible
general 2022-06-04 10:18:30 i know there's starfox command on the ds
general 2022-06-04 10:19:51 it's not like a usual starfox game though, it's turn based
general 2022-06-04 10:20:02 but i think starfox 2 does this format way better
general 2022-06-04 10:21:07 flashcarts are the way to go if you don't have much space
general 2022-06-04 10:21:21 but of course there's the timebomb shit with the ds
general 2022-06-04 10:22:15 it's not like the snes where you can just get an everdrive from krikzz and have a great experience
general 2022-06-04 10:22:50 i don't own any flashcarts
general 2022-06-04 10:23:15 basically the starfox 2 source
general 2022-06-04 10:23:26 it's literally a giant starfox 1 romhack
general 2022-06-04 10:23:55 infact starfox 2 started out as a 2 player experiment for starfox 1
general 2022-06-04 10:24:11 this shit happened in 2018
general 2022-06-04 10:24:17 they had the goods for 2 years
general 2022-06-04 10:25:45 looking at all the lost contents is something
general 2022-06-04 10:26:01 these are all the individual workstation backups
general 2022-06-04 10:26:16 nice
general 2022-06-04 10:27:09 they go up to 41
general 2022-06-04 10:27:16 and this is all that got recovered
general 2022-06-04 10:27:43 yes i know
general 2022-06-04 10:27:52 very funny experience
general 2022-06-04 10:28:38 7/41 backups
general 2022-06-04 10:28:40 34 lost
general 2022-06-04 10:28:53 some are blatant errors such as "tape damage"
general 2022-06-04 10:29:15 quite obvious why it didn't get recovered
general 2022-06-04 10:29:39 i think they just didn't bother with doing the backups properly
general 2022-06-04 10:29:44 that's very good
general 2022-06-04 10:30:30 i think the only reason why they did these backups was for starfox 2
general 2022-06-04 10:31:02 these were recovered from ancient tapes from the mid 90s
general 2022-06-04 10:31:15 and were processed in 2016
general 2022-06-04 10:31:21 a year before the snes classic released
general 2022-06-04 10:32:37 this one was backed up on the 14th of june 1993
general 2022-06-04 10:34:03 they didn't even bother to keep the folder in the backup
general 2022-06-04 10:34:54 since the folder was literally taken and put into another folder
general 2022-06-04 10:35:20 mario-z is the partial source of super mario all stars
general 2022-06-04 10:36:35 original super mario bros source files were also partially preserved in this
general 2022-06-04 10:37:00 super mario advance
general 2022-06-04 10:37:30 it's one of the super mario advance games, i forgot the number

general 2022-06-04 11:40:58 can't be true

general 2022-06-05 12:58:32 useful
general 2022-06-05 12:58:46 internet archive is such a place
general 2022-06-05 12:59:11 get old mate madattak to do this
general 2022-06-05 12:59:40 you can add the thumbnail but not remove it
general 2022-06-05 12:59:44 smartest system

general 2022-06-05 13:00:21 rick is trying to remove the horrendous 200m thumbnail

general 2022-06-05 13:01:45 he literally can't do that
general 2022-06-05 13:01:53 because roblox is the best platform
general 2022-06-05 13:02:20 there must be a reason why it hasn't been done yet
general 2022-06-05 13:03:40 madattak has to do it
general 2022-06-05 13:06:33 pct you have stumbled into a disaster
general 2022-06-05 13:07:31 
general 2022-06-05 13:08:55 skill issue
general 2022-06-05 13:09:05 no
general 2022-06-05 13:09:36 pc2 should have more useful features rather than cats

general 2022-06-05 13:15:51 the collapse is happening sooner than expected
general 2022-06-05 13:17:52 madattak will fix this
general 2022-06-05 13:17:55 i hope
general 2022-06-05 13:25:09 it's terrible
general 2022-06-06 01:29:28 people acting like pupper will be gone forever even though he said he'll be back in 2 weeks
general 2022-06-06 01:29:37 we once endured months without gammarad
general 2022-06-06 01:30:03 we can do it again
general 2022-06-06 01:30:30 he's going to be back in 2 weeks

general 2022-06-06 06:37:07 
general 2022-06-06 07:57:03 didn't really care about elec's ban
general 2022-06-06 07:57:29 i think so
general 2022-06-06 07:58:45 cad is not hated
general 2022-06-06 08:10:31 he left for 2 weeks
general 2022-06-06 08:10:49 he'll be back
general 2022-06-06 08:10:55 he's done this before though
general 2022-06-06 08:11:01 that's what makes this different
general 2022-06-06 08:40:47 turning it into windows 95
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 09:19:15 reconstruction has begun
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 09:45:16 assets from an ancient build of pilotwings that is most likely lost
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 09:45:29 from around late 1988
general 2022-06-06 10:40:18 exactly
general 2022-06-06 10:41:04 no
general 2022-06-06 10:41:07 can't be true
general 2022-06-06 12:58:48 the reconstruction is going smoothly
general 2022-06-06 13:04:08 mac tonight
general 2022-06-06 13:05:49 i can say it's wildly different compared to how it was 2 years ago
general 2022-06-06 13:08:52 such nice assets made for a tech demo
general 2022-06-06 13:09:33 well a tech demo is meant to obviously show the capabilities of the system
general 2022-06-06 13:09:45 so having nice looking assets is great
general 2022-06-06 13:11:28 we even have the level graphics for this build, i would love to have this
general 2022-06-06 13:11:52 forged
general 2022-06-06 13:24:50 no mel is still here
general 2022-06-06 13:24:59 gammarad is still on his break
general 2022-06-06 13:25:06 wait what
general 2022-06-06 13:25:17 he was just here
general 2022-06-06 13:25:19 oh well
general 2022-06-06 13:27:36 i've seen this many times before
general 2022-06-06 13:27:42 they usually come back
general 2022-06-06 13:28:40 who
general 2022-06-06 13:29:01 oh i looked him up
general 2022-06-06 13:29:07 he's coming back after pride month lol
general 2022-06-06 13:30:38 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/497142796961054721/981688852769042505/nasty_rave.gif
general 2022-06-06 13:41:18 you must stay
general 2022-06-06 13:42:15 left because of pc2 being a joke at this point
general 2022-06-06 13:42:25 it will never be released
general 2022-06-06 13:42:36 we are just waiting on the pre alpha
general 2022-06-06 13:46:40 we will stay
general 2022-06-06 14:08:49 there's a very funny argument here
general 2022-06-06 14:10:13 twitter is alright if you stay in the right places
general 2022-06-06 14:14:01 as for solee, i've definitely seen him post message links to his builds in creations multiple times here with no context
general 2022-06-06 14:16:02 wtf are those plug sockets
general 2022-06-06 14:16:04 unsafe
general 2022-06-06 14:16:49 what i'm implying is that there's no ground connection
general 2022-06-06 14:16:58 which is kind of important for safety
general 2022-06-06 14:17:26 yeah it's funny isn't it
general 2022-06-06 14:17:35 it's just the same thing over and over again
general 2022-06-06 14:18:11 i can't see it lol
general 2022-06-06 14:18:17 but i assume it's there
general 2022-06-06 14:18:57 well ground connections should be there
general 2022-06-06 14:19:34 alright good
general 2022-06-06 14:21:56 you do know you can just paste it in the message box and delete it
general 2022-06-06 14:22:55 it's because people have been warned for doing that
general 2022-06-06 14:43:41 he was partially right in some ways
general 2022-06-06 14:45:01 the message link thing was one of the things he was right about, if your ctrl c and ctrl v shortcuts don’t work, you don’t have to send a link to your own build in general to test it
general 2022-06-06 14:46:50 infact going to creations to get the link is slower than just getting a link to a random message, and if you do want to test it with your build, delete the link after you see it working
general 2022-06-06 14:47:11 wait who did you say that to
general 2022-06-06 14:47:16 hars?
general 2022-06-06 14:47:28 oh
general 2022-06-06 14:51:56 dementia
general 2022-06-06 14:52:48 morbius rerelease
general 2022-06-06 14:53:28 because of a stupid argument and partially because he didn’t really like pcc
general 2022-06-06 14:54:08 (he was right in some ways in regards to the argument)
general 2022-06-06 15:06:59 i’m sure i’ve seen people warned for shit like that
general 2022-06-06 15:35:09 oh that’s that copier lmao
general 2022-06-06 15:35:26 why is this argument still going
general 2022-06-06 15:35:37 i thought it ended a while ago
general 2022-06-06 15:38:09 
general 2022-06-06 15:40:15 got the morbs
general 2022-06-06 15:41:23

general 2022-06-07 04:02:34 2 submissions
general 2022-06-07 04:02:42 just like the spaceship team contest
general 2022-06-07 04:03:09 even worse than the spaceship one then
general 2022-06-07 04:03:16 since both builds had a positive score
general 2022-06-07 04:03:26 never thought i would see something worse
general 2022-06-07 08:22:54 there's no way this can be real
general 2022-06-07 10:01:19 epic games launcher

general 2022-06-07 11:15:40 morbius is an experience
general 2022-06-07 11:18:46 no
general 2022-06-07 11:18:53 you have to search for it

general 2022-06-15 10:35:20 not good
general 2022-06-15 10:36:31 because apple makes quality products
general 2022-06-15 10:37:55 in terms of build quality
general 2022-06-15 10:38:49 it’s mostly the brand name
general 2022-06-15 10:39:09 since apple has been around since the 70s
general 2022-06-15 10:39:28 the product design is just iconic
general 2022-06-15 10:40:26 yeah they’re attempting to stop 3rd party repairs
general 2022-06-15 10:40:46 my ipad is still on ios14

general 2022-06-15 10:41:20 not just apple

general 2022-06-17 05:58:11 the wings are supposed to flip, not turn
general 2022-06-17 05:58:33 and the positioning of the wings on the hinge is off
general 2022-06-17 05:59:05 it's meant to be like this
general 2022-06-17 06:03:12 funny
general 2022-06-17 06:03:58 even all the hinge stuff is on the document
general 2022-06-17 06:04:05 but other than that it's a great render

general 2022-06-18 12:29:29 refuse to believe that
general 2022-06-18 13:52:18 very good
general 2022-06-18 13:57:35 wow hi inventer
general 2022-06-18 13:58:41 it is time
general 2022-06-18 13:59:00 smooth criminal is a masterpiece
general 2022-06-18 13:59:04 no questions
general 2022-06-18 13:59:23 my favourite mj song
general 2022-06-18 13:59:34 yeah understandable
general 2022-06-18 14:00:35 the moonwalker mix is the best version
general 2022-06-18 14:00:48 shame it's not released outside of the music video
general 2022-06-18 14:01:30 well the multitracks are around
general 2022-06-18 14:01:37 but not as good as an original mix
general 2022-06-18 14:02:56 there's a few on youtube but they're all weird chopped up versions
general 2022-06-18 14:03:17 and i noticed that some versions on youtube have some tracks missing
general 2022-06-18 14:03:46 my audacity dumpster fire still has the most amount of tracks included from the source
general 2022-06-18 14:03:51 oh no
general 2022-06-18 14:04:07 but there's like absolutely no mixing at all
general 2022-06-18 14:05:20 theoretically you can literally recreate smooth criminal from scratch now
general 2022-06-18 14:05:34 the yamaha dx7 is used for many instruments
general 2022-06-18 14:05:44 and the full vocal tracks are there
general 2022-06-18 14:06:01 disaster
general 2022-06-18 14:06:08 one still survived
general 2022-06-18 14:06:45 
general 2022-06-18 14:06:47 i have it all
general 2022-06-18 14:07:01 the audacity project is so good
general 2022-06-18 14:07:08 it crashes audacity most of the time
general 2022-06-18 14:07:58 can i get into pcc2
general 2022-06-18 14:08:08 just to see how it is
general 2022-06-18 14:08:13 no
general 2022-06-18 14:08:23 acts of god
general 2022-06-18 14:11:48 is that really good movie
general 2022-06-18 14:11:58 with the moon
general 2022-06-18 14:12:48 no
general 2022-06-18 14:12:54 it's not kong
general 2022-06-18 14:12:56 far from it
general 2022-06-18 14:13:14 no it's 2001 a space odyssey iirc
general 2022-06-18 14:13:26 yeah i think that's it
general 2022-06-18 14:13:28 kong 2
general 2022-06-18 14:15:24 too bad

general 2022-06-18 14:15:56 too powerful
general 2022-06-18 14:16:03 have to have 20 tabs open
general 2022-06-18 14:16:25 
general 2022-06-18 14:16:48 you have to find out
general 2022-06-18 14:16:51 it's a challenge
general 2022-06-18 14:17:04 because i need them
general 2022-06-18 14:17:12 like i actually do need them
general 2022-06-18 14:17:32 all my graphics/palette/tilemap editing stuff
general 2022-06-18 14:17:36 and the emulators
general 2022-06-18 14:17:50 yes
general 2022-06-18 14:18:14 audacity is for marble madness 2 samples
general 2022-06-18 14:18:30 
general 2022-06-18 14:18:49 holy shit
general 2022-06-18 14:18:53 yes
general 2022-06-18 14:19:01 i need a trackball for the original
general 2022-06-18 14:19:25 since i got to ultimate race and couldn't get up the ramp since i'm using keyboard
general 2022-06-18 14:20:07 but the version of marble madness 2 that is out is meant for joysticks
general 2022-06-18 14:20:15 so i can actually play it
general 2022-06-18 14:22:11 best part is that i can't even say the program name here
general 2022-06-18 14:22:19 even though it's a general purpose tile editor
general 2022-06-18 14:25:27 marble madness is honestly really good
general 2022-06-18 14:25:48 even though i'm in pcc2 i'll still mainly talk here
general 2022-06-18 14:26:04 yeah lean land is dead
general 2022-06-18 14:26:07 saddest moment
general 2022-06-18 14:26:45 you get the morbius channel
general 2022-06-18 14:26:53 i actually watched morbius btw
general 2022-06-18 14:27:21 yeah i don't say slurs
general 2022-06-18 14:28:09 it was amazing
general 2022-06-18 14:28:13 10/10 morbs
general 2022-06-18 14:28:38 in morbius he makes a morbing milk which morbs him into morbius
general 2022-06-18 14:28:54 and other morbius wants to morb too but he says no
general 2022-06-18 14:29:20 but he stole the morbing milk and became another morbius
general 2022-06-18 14:31:58 ok back to graphics
general 2022-06-18 14:34:59 it's not really active
general 2022-06-18 14:35:11 yeah members mean nothing
general 2022-06-18 14:35:16 chat activity matters
general 2022-06-18 14:35:29 well the member count
general 2022-06-18 14:35:41 yeah
general 2022-06-18 14:35:46 it's here for me
general 2022-06-18 14:36:11 actually i have 3
general 2022-06-18 14:36:15 not just pcc
general 2022-06-18 14:37:26 why did the bot take 20 years to do that

general 2022-06-18 15:10:37 in the archives
general 2022-06-18 15:11:12 2ypes expects me to get things with no context
general 2022-06-18 15:11:16 (bad archiving)
general 2022-06-18 15:11:22 i ensure context is there
general 2022-06-18 15:11:35 worst kind
general 2022-06-18 15:11:44 since it's not truthful most of the time
general 2022-06-18 15:11:58 i've been doing this for a while
general 2022-06-18 15:12:05 i didn't even know you were doing it
general 2022-06-18 15:14:39 that's good

general 2022-06-18 15:29:28 thanks
general 2022-06-18 15:30:05 the composer of the original starfox only worked on the original starfox
general 2022-06-18 15:30:20 because he couldn't release the music as his own
general 2022-06-18 15:30:26 it was technically nintendo's
general 2022-06-18 15:31:03 but he did it anyway
general 2022-06-18 15:31:38 idk
general 2022-06-18 15:31:38 hajime does real estate or something now
general 2022-06-18 15:31:58 that's the reason behind starfox 2's different sound
general 2022-06-18 15:32:14 but they still retained most of the hirasawa set
general 2022-06-18 15:32:35 including the lead, heavy guitar, and drums
general 2022-06-18 15:32:42 along with much more
general 2022-06-18 15:34:22 the heavy guitar was originally way different
general 2022-06-18 15:34:40 as well as the drums
general 2022-06-18 15:34:44 but the lead stayed
general 2022-06-18 16:45:11 you can't escape it
general 2022-06-19 02:02:16 war tank guy

general 2022-06-19 03:40:07 roblox made all sound effects less than 6 seconds long public
general 2022-06-19 03:40:20 but they didn't make my daytona usa hornet sound public

general 2022-06-19 03:48:05 rick astley is actually on the floating island

general 2022-06-19 09:45:27 marble madness 2 has 13 actual maps
general 2022-06-19 09:45:49 not including the practice map and the 3 bonus stages
general 2022-06-19 09:46:26 ice levels are shit though (north pole in particular)
general 2022-06-19 09:51:51 i am going to play marble madness and get to the ultimate stage
general 2022-06-19 09:52:07 and then not do anything since i don't have a trackball

general 2022-06-21 01:16:37 i might be blue, but I chose the colour in 2020 and didn’t change it
general 2022-06-21 01:18:37 jhy_pyro is an average 2021 blue name (not good)
general 2022-06-21 01:21:03 why do you want this

general 2022-06-22 10:32:43 i want to know
general 2022-06-22 10:33:07 oh yeah they fucked literally everything up with sonic origins
general 2022-06-22 10:33:20 every game is messed up in some way
general 2022-06-22 10:33:44 sonic 1 and 2 don't use the high quality remasters
general 2022-06-22 10:33:52 sonic cd's opening is sped up
general 2022-06-22 10:34:39 sonic 3&k have some minor level issues (misplaced tiles in mushroom hill for example)
general 2022-06-22 10:34:44 and the music
general 2022-06-22 10:42:04 at least send it to me since i was pinged

general 2022-06-22 10:46:52 how did they manage to find the worst version of the song
general 2022-06-22 10:47:08 even worse than the pc midi version
general 2022-06-22 10:48:26 but there is a good side to it
general 2022-06-22 10:49:02 people believe this is an earlier smps conversion that belonged to a prototype pre-1103
general 2022-06-22 10:49:23 explains why they all sound generic
general 2022-06-22 10:49:41 jun didn't do the zone tracks
general 2022-06-22 10:49:52 he did the new super theme (which is meh)
general 2022-06-22 10:57:48 you should check first
general 2022-06-22 11:07:26 https://youtu.be/eAGRVDZdB3Q megaman x is a challenging game but the ost is so good
general 2022-06-22 11:27:44 emulation part is too true
general 2022-06-22 11:29:44 hi gamma
general 2022-06-22 11:46:00 for the archives

general 2022-06-22 12:19:06 you have image perms there
general 2022-06-22 13:16:21 no more tutorials
general 2022-06-23 05:52:36 i still can't work out the starblade pcm format
general 2022-06-23 05:52:47 i got marble madness 2 2nd try
general 2022-06-23 05:53:09 but this game is very weird with the pcm samples
general 2022-06-23 05:54:21 oh shit
general 2022-06-23 05:54:25 i just worked it out
general 2022-06-23 05:54:32 it was only the speech that was fucked up
general 2022-06-23 05:56:36 sample rom 2
general 2022-06-23 05:56:51 there are loud parts since some voice clips are included
general 2022-06-23 05:58:09 oh shit sample rom 3 has the sample for octopus
general 2022-06-23 05:58:22 as well as geosword's alarm
general 2022-06-23 05:59:41 sample rom 3
general 2022-06-23 05:59:48 hi
general 2022-06-23 06:05:25 it just has voice samples
general 2022-06-23 06:05:41 so not interesting
general 2022-06-23 06:05:53 oh wait i already did starblade before lmao
general 2022-06-23 06:06:19 i uploaded the sample roms to the vgm sources server
general 2022-06-23 06:06:49 proper
general 2022-06-23 06:07:23 i did the previous rips at 8000hz
general 2022-06-23 06:07:35 these ones are at 16000hz
general 2022-06-23 06:07:48 and i removed the voice samples
general 2022-06-23 06:08:11 well at least it confirms that the voice samples are at 8000hz
general 2022-06-23 06:17:02 one interesting thing i learnt about the starblade hardware is that there's no tilemap support
general 2022-06-23 06:20:10 wtf doublewide is back
general 2022-06-23 06:20:15 since when
general 2022-06-23 06:36:56 no cd drive
bot-central 2022-06-23 08:38:10 ?whois
general 2022-06-23 11:43:57 some trolling
general 2022-06-23 11:44:16 i got like 100 jerrycans in my inventory and dropped them all at once
general 2022-06-23 11:44:20 there was a huge spire
general 2022-06-23 11:48:03 i did this earlier
general 2022-06-23 11:48:10 it just did

general 2022-06-23 12:17:29 no
general 2022-06-23 12:17:35 that is impossible
general 2022-06-23 12:18:55 collective agreement
general 2022-06-23 12:19:58 
general 2022-06-23 12:20:35 in all seriousness i don't hate the french
general 2022-06-23 12:21:16 what about nascar
general 2022-06-23 12:21:25 specifically the daytona 500
general 2022-06-23 12:21:55 they just go around in a circle
general 2022-06-23 12:22:01 rally is better
general 2022-06-23 12:23:49 the starfox fanbase is almost as divisive as the sonic fanbase
general 2022-06-23 12:24:10 good game series
general 2022-06-23 12:24:20 well only 1, 2, and 64
general 2022-06-23 12:24:27 rest are meh or bad
general 2022-06-23 12:27:16 there are groups of purists who only like the snes titles, and/or 64
general 2022-06-23 12:27:40 then the starfox adventures people
general 2022-06-23 12:33:27 the moment of realisation
general 2022-06-23 12:50:16 i've experienced this many times
general 2022-06-23 12:53:33 the server is kind of inactive

general 2022-06-26 14:46:26 snes stuff
general 2022-06-26 14:46:57 (first piece of footage from this event)
general 2022-06-26 14:47:30 over 33 years later
general 2022-06-26 14:49:02 daytona usa (arcade) is where it's at

general 2022-06-26 14:53:38 i swear i've tried to use a ps4 controller through usb before and it didn't work
general 2022-06-26 14:55:19 the switch pro controller dpad is one of the worst dpads from nintendo
general 2022-06-26 14:55:25 literally
general 2022-06-26 14:55:40 the tiny gamecube dpad is better
general 2022-06-26 14:56:52 every emulator i tried it on refused to recognise it lmao
general 2022-06-26 14:57:33 i attempted to use it on mame, snes9x, mesen, bsnes plus, and kega
general 2022-06-26 14:58:08 i always play starfox 2 on the snes classic

general 2022-06-29 13:33:41 it might be a pfp challenge, but there was a time where he unironically used these
general 2022-06-29 13:35:11 so i played megaman x2
general 2022-06-29 13:35:23 it's not as good as x1
general 2022-06-29 13:35:34 in both the music and gameplay
general 2022-06-29 13:38:28 good
general 2022-06-29 13:38:38 one of the best star wars movies
general 2022-06-29 13:39:13 disney literally ruined the series with the sequels
general 2022-06-29 13:41:04 literally every maverick stage in x1 has an incredible theme
general 2022-06-29 13:41:29 i could only find 2 great tracks in x2
general 2022-06-29 13:41:40 i will pull up an exact date

general 2022-06-29 14:05:51 here's a stage theme from megaman x2
general 2022-06-29 14:06:02 and here's one from a similar stage in megaman x1
general 2022-06-29 14:06:13 one is clearly better
general 2022-06-29 14:07:04 embed fail
general 2022-06-29 14:07:24 wow delete

general 2022-06-30 03:09:19 (the actual level is better than anything in x2)
general 2022-06-30 03:14:32 wow playing fortnite
general 2022-06-30 03:14:54 people hate on fortnite but it's actually not a bad game
general 2022-06-30 03:15:03 the community is the worst thing on the planet though
general 2022-06-30 03:15:39 chapter 2 was a mistake
general 2022-06-30 03:16:05 yeah it does get boring
general 2022-06-30 03:16:29 chapter 2 season 6 was the worst season ever
general 2022-06-30 03:16:53 there was this overcomplicated crafting shit
general 2022-06-30 03:17:22 you had to get bones or mechanical parts to make better weapons
general 2022-06-30 03:17:52 i think the crafting was executed better in chapter 2 season 8
general 2022-06-30 03:18:18 you could upgrade the sideways weapons with cube monster parts
general 2022-06-30 03:21:28 you must learn the fortnite lore
general 2022-06-30 03:22:18 now spiderman and batman is part of the lore
general 2022-06-30 03:22:24 and darth vader
general 2022-06-30 03:24:00 yeah but it's a "grey area" here
general 2022-06-30 03:25:34 i don’t really get why you would use shaders
general 2022-06-30 03:25:54 i would just play the game as intended
general 2022-06-30 03:26:36 it’s like those filters for retro games which make them look muddy and low quality
general 2022-06-30 03:26:52 and it’s supposed to be an “enhancement”
general 2022-06-30 03:44:39 yeah shaders are controversial here
general 2022-06-30 03:44:50 people have been warned for them before
general 2022-06-30 03:47:51 it's a breach of the roblox tos iirc
general 2022-06-30 08:44:36 someone said the exact same thing last time he was in vc lmao
general 2022-06-30 08:44:58 hi

general 2022-06-30 11:07:15 oh no
general 2022-06-30 11:07:34 hars left because he didn't like the server
general 2022-06-30 11:08:17 and he got into an argument with solee because he noticed that solee kept posting message links to his builds without context
general 2022-06-30 11:09:00 yeah
general 2022-06-30 11:40:48 no
general 2022-06-30 11:46:11 honestly i have no clue
general 2022-06-30 11:52:24 rise of gru

general 2022-07-01 07:27:32 yeah that's fucked up
general 2022-07-01 08:16:50 that's really disrespectful
general 2022-07-01 08:17:28 it's because he was a popular figure in the minecraft community
general 2022-07-01 08:17:32 and he died at 23
general 2022-07-01 08:17:46 that's young
general 2022-07-01 08:18:47 i'm not a fan of minecraft content in general, but i'm still respectful regarding the issue
general 2022-07-01 08:20:26 shit, hope you're alright

general 2022-07-01 09:12:19 they spell park as "parc"
general 2022-07-01 09:12:42 and forests as "forets"
general 2022-07-01 09:14:43 does boxness realise that only people who know japanese can actually read the important message in his bio
general 2022-07-01 09:14:57 or people who bother to translate it
general 2022-07-01 09:15:07 i have watched morbius
general 2022-07-01 09:16:46 "i am venom, i'm just kidding it's dr. michael morbius at your service" - morbius

(good place to start)
general 2022-07-01 09:28:15 does tiktok have classics such as metalworking tips
general 2022-07-01 09:28:17 i think not
general 2022-07-01 09:29:37 made in 2003
general 2022-07-01 09:29:46 you're not wrong

general 2022-07-01 09:31:53 what youtube video
general 2022-07-01 09:32:12 you can't just say "youtube" and pass it off as a trustworthy source
general 2022-07-01 09:32:26 i didn't say apple had more users
general 2022-07-01 09:32:40 i just said billions
general 2022-07-01 09:32:59 of people
general 2022-07-01 09:33:26 (may or may not be overexaggerated)
general 2022-07-01 09:33:52 ok
general 2022-07-01 09:34:10 the super nintendo literally uses sony chips inside
general 2022-07-01 09:34:23 it's not exactly a new concept
general 2022-07-01 09:35:05 and the atari 2600 just uses off the shelf components (except the stella chip)
general 2022-07-01 09:35:42 ruru have you gotten your source yet
general 2022-07-01 09:36:04 i'm not a fan of tiktok, but i don't just pass off any random shit as real info lmao
general 2022-07-01 09:36:22 this might start getting into politics soon
general 2022-07-01 09:40:20 apple has been shitty regarding device repairs
general 2022-07-01 09:40:50 they are deliberately making their devices harder to open and repair
general 2022-07-01 09:41:02 it really is
general 2022-07-01 09:42:05 yes exactly
general 2022-07-01 09:42:41 you have to look at things in an unbiased view
general 2022-07-01 09:43:11 mega man x
general 2022-07-01 09:43:23 or x2
general 2022-07-01 09:52:28 but why

general 2022-07-03 14:27:02 because spotify is terrible
general 2022-07-03 14:27:21 there's a reason why i've moved to my own files
general 2022-07-03 14:28:07 almost the whole game and i never realised i could play as zero
general 2022-07-03 14:30:45 it's 72 bucks for a 6 month membership here lmao
general 2022-07-03 14:31:07 no i've moved to lossless files
general 2022-07-03 14:36:24 doesn't do shit for spotify

general 2022-07-04 04:21:24 hyper duel sample searching has begun
general 2022-07-04 05:12:51 i can't wait for this to be restored
general 2022-07-04 05:13:05 we're only missing the orchestra hit samples and the tom samples
general 2022-07-04 05:13:21 i found the rest
general 2022-07-04 05:13:36 
general 2022-07-04 05:14:08 very good
general 2022-07-04 05:16:52 i'm going to piece together a small part manually
general 2022-07-04 05:18:29 sure why not
general 2022-07-04 05:21:10 no it was invalid too
general 2022-07-04 05:21:23 no clue and i don't care
general 2022-07-04 05:21:38 i don't really play roblox much
general 2022-07-04 05:39:10 literally all i've got done
general 2022-07-04 05:39:27 no it's not a fail
general 2022-07-04 05:39:31 it's a you problem
general 2022-07-04 05:39:51 thanks
general 2022-07-04 05:43:21 i put in 1 snare and i already give up
general 2022-07-04 05:43:33 this is too difficult with audacity
general 2022-07-04 05:44:11 no i have to drag the samples to the right spot
general 2022-07-04 05:44:33 i'm going to try openmpt
general 2022-07-04 06:00:01 openmpt still too difficult
general 2022-07-04 06:11:50 what i've got so far
general 2022-07-04 06:28:25 true
general 2022-07-04 06:29:35 this can almost be restored
general 2022-07-04 06:29:38 i think there's only 1 sample missing
general 2022-07-04 06:32:18 i don't think rick would release a crucial script that is currently in use to some random person
general 2022-07-04 06:32:50 or anyone that isn't a part of his team
general 2022-07-04 06:33:07 since that could leak out and shit could happen
general 2022-07-04 06:34:54 more expansive maps have been unlocked in starfox 2
general 2022-07-04 06:35:03 now there are 2 banks for map data
general 2022-07-04 06:35:26 but path files are still being pieces of shit
general 2022-07-04 06:35:48 there was experimentation with a paths3.asm file and it was slightly off
general 2022-07-04 06:39:10 it all looks fine at the start and then it just goes to this
general 2022-07-04 06:39:57 how it's supposed to look
general 2022-07-04 06:40:29 starfox 2 is literally a giant starfox 1 romhack
general 2022-07-04 06:40:38 it started off as a 2 player experiment
general 2022-07-04 08:31:26 roblox isn't great
general 2022-07-04 08:32:13 roblox can't even be bothered to make an x64 version of their client
general 2022-07-04 08:32:58 nintendo is very shitty when it comes to fangames
general 2022-07-04 08:33:41 there's an official sega endorsed sonic roblox game
general 2022-07-04 08:33:57 sonic speed simulator
general 2022-07-04 08:35:07 it was literally featured in the official sonic central presentation
general 2022-07-04 09:12:46 lol
general 2022-07-04 09:56:37 finally
general 2022-07-04 09:56:45 the special one
general 2022-07-04 09:58:22 lmao
general 2022-07-04 10:16:51 megaman X3 review
general 2022-07-04 10:16:52 good game
general 2022-07-04 10:17:04 the ice level is the worst one
general 2022-07-04 10:17:21 some enhancements are really overcomplicated
general 2022-07-04 10:18:08 (the z-saber requires you to beat a boss with a specific weapon, go to the 2nd last stage and switch to zero before a specific miniboss door)
general 2022-07-04 10:19:00 the soundtrack is overall better than megaman x2, nothing can get to the level of x1's ost
general 2022-07-04 10:19:07 zero's theme is good
general 2022-07-04 10:22:23 the secret boss stage has one of the best tracks in the whole game
general 2022-07-04 10:22:58 you literally only have 2 chances to get to this stage
general 2022-07-04 10:23:04 i was lucky
general 2022-07-04 10:24:15 the sound driver in x3 sounds different than x2
general 2022-07-04 10:24:26 it's like a blend of the x1 and x2 drivers
general 2022-07-04 10:25:41 password screen theme isn't that great, same as the upgrade capsule theme
general 2022-07-04 10:29:53 i'm having more of a listen and i actually prefer x2's now lmao
general 2022-07-04 10:30:03 just more memorable stuff in x2
general 2022-07-04 10:41:39 they went through the effort to port megaman x3 to the ps1 for some fmv's, buster effects, and fancy "ready" text
general 2022-07-04 10:41:41 lmao
general 2022-07-04 10:41:52 otherwise it looks basically the same
general 2022-07-04 12:04:32 average epic gamer win

general 2022-07-06 14:52:55 but it might actually be good
general 2022-07-06 14:57:19 he had to completely rewrite plane crazy and add new stuff on top
general 2022-07-06 14:57:39 of course it's going to take a long time
general 2022-07-06 15:00:20 iirc pc2 has been in development for around 3 years
general 2022-07-06 15:06:26 you have to understand, the initial project was just the rewrite
general 2022-07-06 15:06:37 and rick was working on his own for most of it
general 2022-07-06 15:07:03 while balancing his personal life in the process
general 2022-07-06 15:07:49 that's the real reason why it's taking so long
general 2022-07-06 15:09:16 ^
general 2022-07-06 15:09:56 he's shown some tests
general 2022-07-06 15:10:01 and part of the hud

general 2022-07-06 15:21:41 those palette cycles
general 2022-07-06 15:22:04 on lines 4, 5, 6, and 7
general 2022-07-06 15:28:22 now this is amazing, tilemap used to draw the zooming out ship, sprites for the background effects, and the entire sequence before this was done with sprites and tilemaps
general 2022-07-06 15:29:08 you don't need to ask for me to share
general 2022-07-06 15:29:13 i can share whenever i want
general 2022-07-06 15:30:40 seamless switch from tilemap to actual sprite

general 2022-07-09 14:36:38 how can you endure 3 hours of genshin
general 2022-07-09 14:36:51 you have to be insane

general 2022-07-09 14:40:25 no
general 2022-07-09 14:41:00 i don't see the point
general 2022-07-09 14:41:17 ^
general 2022-07-09 14:41:24 it's just not funny
general 2022-07-09 14:41:41 that is why we're not doing it
general 2022-07-09 14:41:47 do it yourself
general 2022-07-09 14:42:18 we're just telling you to do it yourself
general 2022-07-09 14:42:24 not really an argument
general 2022-07-09 14:44:17 just use video editor
general 2022-07-09 14:44:26 literally a 1 minute job
general 2022-07-09 14:45:12 i think that's an issue specific to you
general 2022-07-09 14:45:28 you do know there's a built in video editor in windows right?
general 2022-07-09 14:45:43 that runs well
general 2022-07-09 14:45:57 makes sense
general 2022-07-09 14:48:01 i saw what got deleted
general 2022-07-09 14:48:13 because that word is filtered
general 2022-07-09 14:48:49 we literally have 13 year olds here what do you think

general 2022-07-12 08:44:31 what the fuck
general 2022-07-12 08:44:42 that's literally a hover engine and landing gear
general 2022-07-12 08:45:44 also it's literally a 5 second build
general 2022-07-12 08:46:30 i haven't actually played pc properly since 2021
general 2022-07-12 08:46:55 like early to mid 2021

general 2022-07-12 12:17:20 no hard
general 2022-07-12 12:17:56 
general 2022-07-12 12:19:08 idk
general 2022-07-12 12:59:06 i've literally never heard of trauma team despite owning every nintendo console since the wii
general 2022-07-12 12:59:24 well up to the original switch model
general 2022-07-12 12:59:30 no point in having a gamecube
general 2022-07-12 12:59:37 the wii is a gamecube
general 2022-07-12 12:59:50 not handhelds though
general 2022-07-12 12:59:59 i am a proud wii u owner
general 2022-07-12 13:00:23 i do have the new 3ds xl
general 2022-07-12 13:00:35 no gamecube controllers
general 2022-07-12 13:00:50 ok so you pirate games
general 2022-07-12 13:00:57 with the usb loader tool
general 2022-07-12 13:01:18 i have never modded my wii, still stock firmware
general 2022-07-12 13:01:31 or any of my consoles
general 2022-07-12 13:01:49 no
general 2022-07-12 13:01:59 i have an original gameboy though
general 2022-07-12 13:02:04 the dmg model
general 2022-07-12 13:02:17 and the snes mini console
general 2022-07-12 13:02:43 hot take but the majority of the nes library aged really poorly
general 2022-07-12 13:02:49 no
general 2022-07-12 13:03:12 if you go straight to the snes you get some of the best games of all time
general 2022-07-12 13:03:26 super metroid, link to the past
general 2022-07-12 13:03:42 wild guns is a nice hidden gem
general 2022-07-12 13:03:48 yeah i have a launch day switch
general 2022-07-12 13:04:00 no oled model
general 2022-07-12 13:04:12 bit of a waste since i already have the original
general 2022-07-12 13:04:48 i never use handheld mode
general 2022-07-12 13:04:57 so it's not really a selling point for me
general 2022-07-12 13:05:30 i do have an atari 2600
general 2022-07-12 13:05:36 and a commodore 64
general 2022-07-12 13:06:52 the switch oled is 540 bucks here
general 2022-07-12 13:06:53 yeah no
general 2022-07-12 13:07:05 yep
general 2022-07-12 13:07:23 the switch had amazing games though
general 2022-07-12 13:07:35 mariokart 8 deluxe still holds up well today
general 2022-07-12 13:08:03 mario odyssey looked amazing
general 2022-07-12 13:08:26 the n64 controller
general 2022-07-12 13:09:06 the wii literally had specs that matched the gamecube
general 2022-07-12 13:09:12 it was just a little improved
general 2022-07-12 13:09:22 against what
general 2022-07-12 13:09:45 yeah fair point
general 2022-07-12 13:09:48 still good fun
general 2022-07-12 13:10:06 the snes controller
general 2022-07-12 13:10:08 by far
general 2022-07-12 13:10:20 it's just perfect
general 2022-07-12 13:12:27 they had the base design down by the first public demo, that's how you know it's good
general 2022-07-12 13:16:34 is that word filtered here
general 2022-07-12 13:16:35 idk
general 2022-07-12 13:16:48 oh
general 2022-07-12 15:02:28 it keeps order in the chat
general 2022-07-12 15:16:19 good image
general 2022-07-12 15:16:46 
general 2022-07-12 15:24:23 how the fuck
general 2022-07-12 15:24:34 i thought he didn't get expert from it
general 2022-07-12 15:25:00 it's literally a hover engine and 1x1 landing gear
general 2022-07-12 15:25:06 it's 2 blocks
general 2022-07-12 15:25:13 2 fucking blocks
general 2022-07-12 15:25:18 oh wow
general 2022-07-12 15:25:20 even better
general 2022-07-12 15:27:07 if you're making like a proper original engine, getting expert from that is fine
general 2022-07-12 15:27:19 but not 4 blocks strapped on a starter plane
general 2022-07-12 15:28:12 yeah just build 4 blocks
general 2022-07-12 15:28:19 and put it on a starter plane
general 2022-07-12 15:28:54 meme builds don't qualify for expert
general 2022-07-12 15:29:32 yeah there's the rare exception
general 2022-07-12 15:29:52 but general rule is that meme builds aren't accepted

general 2022-07-25 06:05:14 it's like starfox but not starfox
general 2022-07-25 06:05:28 runs more like a sega cg board game
general 2022-07-25 06:05:35 or a model 2 game
general 2022-07-25 06:06:22 it's got a great ost

general 2022-07-25 13:10:21 not sure about gigaleak 1 though
general 2022-07-25 13:15:10 <@619312093962829849> gigaleak 1 was directly from nintendo themselves because they had their workstation tape backups, nes lotcheck, and snes source code
general 2022-07-25 13:15:29 gigaleak 2 was from the chinese branch, ique
general 2022-07-25 13:16:08 there's many localisation builds included in gigaleak 2
general 2022-07-25 13:16:30 there's various prototypes of the starfox 64 ique release
general 2022-07-25 13:16:36 as well as the original game
general 2022-07-25 13:20:19 super mario kart source snippet
general 2022-07-25 13:20:24 this is the real deal
general 2022-07-25 13:22:22 nintendo literally only got the tape backups for the snes classic
general 2022-07-25 13:22:42 the list file was made in 2016

general 2022-07-27 11:46:29 i'll be changing it with my original sound file
general 2022-07-27 11:46:35 so not an issue
general 2022-07-27 11:47:26 sound review
general 2022-07-27 11:48:05 wtf lmao
general 2022-07-27 11:48:15 it sounds so out of place
general 2022-07-27 11:48:37 oh well
general 2022-07-27 11:49:27 i don't think i will
general 2022-07-27 11:49:30 i'll change it
general 2022-07-27 11:52:00 so there's a bit of an issue
general 2022-07-27 11:52:04 it doesn't work
general 2022-07-27 11:52:34 i wonder if it just rejects the original file
general 2022-07-27 11:52:42 let me try something
general 2022-07-27 11:53:06 audacity
general 2022-07-27 11:53:20 so i can produce a fresh file
general 2022-07-27 11:53:30 no metadata
general 2022-07-27 11:54:21 literally copy and paste in audacity
general 2022-07-27 11:55:16 and i fixed it
general 2022-07-27 11:55:31 have fun
general 2022-07-27 11:55:55 it's just a drop in replacement
general 2022-07-27 11:56:21 it must look for the original file from the metadata or something
general 2022-07-27 11:56:31 i'll experiment with this and document it
general 2022-07-27 11:58:31 keeping it the exact same
general 2022-07-27 12:00:39 i'm going next level
general 2022-07-27 12:00:41 hxd time
general 2022-07-27 12:01:18 i figured it out
general 2022-07-27 12:01:24 the original was an mp3 lmao
general 2022-07-27 12:01:35 the new file is .ogg
general 2022-07-27 12:04:06 use this
general 2022-07-27 12:04:10 i exported the original as ogg
general 2022-07-27 12:04:16 ogg not off

general 2022-07-27 13:08:21 
general 2022-07-27 13:08:56 only part missing
general 2022-07-27 13:09:13 i think it's roadworthy
general 2022-07-27 13:10:05 true
general 2022-07-27 13:10:22 it needs a gun on it
general 2022-07-27 13:11:27 tip the monitor on its side and keep hitting it
general 2022-07-27 13:11:37 will totally work
general 2022-07-27 13:12:17 in ex-zodiac there were tesco trucks in stage 6
general 2022-07-27 13:12:31 in the first build
general 2022-07-27 13:13:44 i need to get a screenshot i still have the 1st release
general 2022-07-27 13:14:18 they already do
general 2022-07-27 13:14:28 it's just like that
general 2022-07-27 13:17:00 
general 2022-07-27 13:17:26 it's like that in the stable release
general 2022-07-27 13:17:35 sadly it was changed in the beta branch
general 2022-07-27 13:18:14 the reasoning behind it is brand loyalty according to the dev
general 2022-07-27 13:18:19 fair enough

general 2022-07-27 13:41:09 it was a legendary event
general 2022-07-27 13:48:12 this is actually sick
general 2022-07-27 13:48:27 i didn't know sgi made this
general 2022-07-27 13:57:30 yeah
general 2022-07-28 07:57:07 bad sleep schedule
general 2022-07-28 08:01:31 is it worth it
general 2022-07-28 08:01:36 for a game i don't even play
general 2022-07-28 08:04:10 very smart
general 2022-07-28 08:15:36 what channels were removed
general 2022-07-28 08:15:41 i honestly can't tell
general 2022-07-28 08:24:50 because of legal issues with tommy tallarico, the composer for cool spot, earthworm jim, and messiah (the source of the sound)
general 2022-07-28 08:25:27 basically roblox has been using a stolen asset for over a decade
general 2022-07-28 08:28:05 the rest of the default roblox sounds come from sample libraries, which means they can use them
general 2022-07-28 08:28:12 all except the old death sound
general 2022-07-28 08:28:41 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1002129650400632882
general 2022-07-28 09:13:22 marble madness 2 and hyperduel use the same sound chips
general 2022-07-28 09:13:54 the games are like 2 years apart so rom size increased obviously
general 2022-07-28 09:14:03 allowing for higher quality samples
general 2022-07-28 11:04:34 <:lidl:874472875627782144>
general 2022-07-28 11:54:49 bit of a skill issue
general 2022-07-28 12:54:04 it
general 2022-07-28 12:54:10 is very easy
general 2022-07-28 12:54:13 to bring it back
general 2022-07-28 12:54:27 who the fuck is kreek
general 2022-07-28 12:54:36 are you even above the age of 13
general 2022-07-28 12:55:02 i literally made a drop in replacement and sent it here
general 2022-07-28 12:55:25 hi orion
general 2022-07-28 12:56:26 yes
general 2022-07-28 12:56:40 don't forget the psg chip from the master system
general 2022-07-28 12:56:57 but i'm really more into the snes scene now, more colours
general 2022-07-28 12:57:25 the megadrive can produce incredible tracks though
general 2022-07-28 12:57:55 better for orchestral tracks
general 2022-07-28 12:59:33 
general 2022-07-28 12:59:58 all from the same ost
general 2022-07-28 13:00:30 technosoft mastered the megadrive's sound capabilities
general 2022-07-28 13:02:02 this will not sound the same with fm
general 2022-07-28 13:02:54 what link is it
general 2022-07-28 13:04:14 wait remove the channel name part
general 2022-07-28 13:04:30 so it ends after the seconds part
general 2022-07-28 13:12:56 sega's super scaler boards all came equipped with the segapcm chip, a proprietary chip that allowed for 16 pcm audio channels

they also came equipped with the ym2151
general 2022-07-28 13:13:13 top of the range hardware at the time
general 2022-07-28 13:15:00 it was so good that the chip was put into super scaler boards from 1985 to 1991
general 2022-07-28 13:20:37 this changed with the cg board (model 1), the multipcm chip used for all cg board games had 28 pcm channels and cd quality sampling
general 2022-07-28 13:21:03 virtua racing had 2 multipcm chips on the board

general 2022-07-29 10:23:30 no sorry
general 2022-07-29 10:25:44 the marble madness 2 vgm rip is oddly low quality
general 2022-07-29 10:27:30 the pcm samples sound way more crisp in game

general 2022-07-30 05:35:24 i've experienced it first hand because i own a wii u
general 2022-07-30 05:36:21 playing off the tv was just a stupid gimmick
general 2022-07-30 05:36:48 touchscreen controller wasn't fully utilised
general 2022-07-30 05:37:51 hardware wasn't that powerful when compared with the competition
general 2022-07-30 05:38:03 not to mention the misguided promotion
general 2022-07-30 05:38:50 some people complained about the weight of the controller for some reason
general 2022-07-30 05:38:57 it wasn't heavy

general 2022-07-30 15:20:42 no more
general 2022-07-31 03:03:26 mate you're saying that but look at your own about me lmao
general 2022-07-31 03:05:29 this is the dumbest counter point i've ever seen
general 2022-07-31 03:06:30 i wouldn't say so
general 2022-07-31 03:07:16 literally
general 2022-07-31 03:07:31 old one is still archived
general 2022-07-31 03:09:21 the stupidest counter points
general 2022-07-31 04:32:52 it's like really easy
general 2022-07-31 04:33:55 this is a drop in replacement i made
general 2022-07-31 04:34:37 how the fuck are you going to get a cease and desist
general 2022-07-31 04:35:34 the new one is .ogg, the older one is .mp3
general 2022-07-31 04:35:57 i made that same mistake and thought roblox did some file detection shit
general 2022-07-31 04:36:03 i was wrong
general 2022-07-31 04:36:42 i properly exported it with the ogg vorbis codec
general 2022-07-31 04:38:10 so you go to your x86 program files because roblox can't be bothered making a 64 bit client
general 2022-07-31 04:38:50 then go to versions, latest one going by last modified date
general 2022-07-31 04:39:17 content, sounds, and then replace the audio file
general 2022-07-31 04:39:25 really simple stuff
general 2022-07-31 04:39:52 mate they are your files on your computer
general 2022-07-31 04:39:57 they can't do shit
general 2022-07-31 04:40:18 they're still technically yours to modify and do whatever with
general 2022-07-31 04:40:32 they can't fine you for that
general 2022-07-31 04:41:15 yeah they have planes
general 2022-07-31 04:44:10 tailed accept my friend request

general 2022-07-31 07:29:52 it was shit back then too
general 2022-07-31 07:31:15 it's been like that for a while
general 2022-07-31 07:31:44 i haven't properly checked creations chat in a while
general 2022-07-31 07:35:09 there is no security with having youtube as a "job"
general 2022-07-31 07:35:36 it could just collapse in a span of days
general 2022-07-31 07:36:38 because the majority of them are under 13
general 2022-07-31 07:36:44 or 13
general 2022-07-31 07:38:21 jump ship and go back to when games didn't have a million microtransactions or dlc
general 2022-07-31 07:39:16 roblox itself is a shitty platform
general 2022-07-31 07:39:30 no 64 bit launcher

general 2022-08-01 11:44:37 the full experience in video form
general 2022-08-01 11:51:57 bit of a stretch
general 2022-08-01 12:57:03 indonesia
general 2022-08-01 13:45:36 
general 2022-08-01 13:46:36 that’s alpha_player’s shredder btw
general 2022-08-01 13:49:30 shredders technically fall under low effort creations
general 2022-08-01 14:17:27 totally photoshopped

general 2022-08-02 09:12:57 and see who crashes
general 2022-08-02 09:41:06 because you laughed at a guy committing suicide
general 2022-08-02 09:41:07 wtf
general 2022-08-02 10:21:19 why lmao
general 2022-08-02 10:21:33 why did this guy get banned
general 2022-08-02 10:21:58 yeah he's doxxed himself like 3 times before
general 2022-08-02 10:22:03 not new
general 2022-08-02 10:23:21 i still have this classic
general 2022-08-02 10:24:01 yes
general 2022-08-02 10:24:16 oh nevermind he doxxed himself 4 times before
general 2022-08-02 10:24:23 not 3
general 2022-08-02 10:30:55 
general 2022-08-02 10:33:32 currently working on new tunnel
general 2022-08-02 10:34:04 i've already confirmed it works as intended in game
general 2022-08-02 10:34:49 starfox
general 2022-08-02 10:34:56 the original one on the snes
general 2022-08-02 10:37:08 the technical aspects of starfox are very interesting
general 2022-08-02 10:37:43 such as the proprietary compressed graphics format and the way scenes like venom highway and titania boss work
general 2022-08-02 10:38:31 he just got banned
general 2022-08-02 10:38:42 idk
general 2022-08-02 10:38:55 <@370594904268734464> why did that mythicalstar guy get banned
general 2022-08-02 10:40:35 obviously built off venom highway, will change palette and might do more stuff
general 2022-08-02 10:40:46 lmao
general 2022-08-02 10:40:59 he's doxxed himself 4 times before
general 2022-08-02 10:41:14 ok he's never leaked his credit card before
general 2022-08-02 10:41:17 that's new
general 2022-08-02 10:41:53 this is why you should never let children around your account
general 2022-08-02 10:41:57 thanks
general 2022-08-02 10:42:35 stock venom highway
general 2022-08-02 10:42:53 i kept the road lines since it's relevant to the intended purpose
general 2022-08-02 10:43:22 will probably add lights to the sides like the regular venom tunnel
general 2022-08-02 10:44:07 i didn't do the ui, i'm just using a starfox hack to test this stuff since it has a built in level select
general 2022-08-02 10:44:31 can't be bothered reenabling planet select in the stock source
general 2022-08-02 10:45:49 fun fact about the regular venom tunnel, there's leftover functionality in the source which makes the tunnel flash red after defeating andross
general 2022-08-02 10:48:01 this is the bg listing for it, it's all commented out
general 2022-08-02 10:49:08 in the final the ending sequence just uses the entry tunnel settings
general 2022-08-02 10:51:08 it was put into a build and i still have the stuff i screenshotted of it working
general 2022-08-02 10:51:49 this also made me realise the venom lights are just copy and paste, nice
general 2022-08-02 10:51:55 no need to redo the graphics
general 2022-08-02 11:45:39 some more stuff
general 2022-08-02 11:46:02 i had to remake the venom tunnel light order on the tilemap
general 2022-08-02 11:46:23 they're in a different spot in the graphics
general 2022-08-02 11:46:33 behind the sense
general 2022-08-02 12:36:39 couple revs
general 2022-08-02 12:59:52 wow you have linux?
general 2022-08-02 12:59:56 what distro
general 2022-08-02 13:00:12 lmao i didn't notice
general 2022-08-02 13:00:30 maybe because i wasn't watching the stream that much
general 2022-08-02 13:21:19 the new banger
general 2022-08-02 13:21:26 i was going to do the highway stage but i didn't have it converted to .it
general 2022-08-02 13:22:05 that doesn't have vibe space sub test as a sample
general 2022-08-02 13:22:16 instantly not as good
general 2022-08-02 13:22:24 well "good"
general 2022-08-02 13:25:39 no door
general 2022-08-02 13:39:54 2 sample findings
general 2022-08-02 13:39:57 winning
general 2022-08-02 23:44:14 good
general 2022-08-02 23:44:50 yes, because the oof sound was stolen from another game
general 2022-08-02 23:45:40 it was stolen from messiah
general 2022-08-03 04:57:31 accurate
general 2022-08-03 06:47:56 thanks for removing the slowmode yousuf
general 2022-08-03 06:48:27 now i can send new sample findings from some f1 arcade game
general 2022-08-03 06:51:34 it's the rules
general 2022-08-03 06:52:14 he is not underaged
general 2022-08-03 06:52:29 that screenshot from hyperbot is old
general 2022-08-03 06:53:24 the new tunnel
general 2022-08-03 06:53:45 in game
general 2022-08-03 06:54:06 thanks
general 2022-08-03 06:55:40 hardest part was the palette
general 2022-08-03 06:56:13 i went for a mix of titania boss, some alpha tunnel elements, and white stripes
general 2022-08-03 06:56:25 wow thought you were still 17
general 2022-08-03 06:59:29 i'm starting to not like the other palette, i'll just make it the other one for titania boss
general 2022-08-03 07:02:28 why
general 2022-08-03 07:02:33 i already have ex-zodiac
general 2022-08-03 07:02:39 which is an incredible game
general 2022-08-03 07:03:32 play super metroid instead
general 2022-08-03 07:04:36 there's just so much skips and techniques that you'll just sort of "get" after playing for a while
general 2022-08-03 07:04:56 i've done 2 100% runs and a randomiser run
general 2022-08-03 07:05:34 i'm only just hacking snes games
general 2022-08-03 09:44:12 is it that pfp guy you're talking about
general 2022-08-04 02:41:51 <@832352865804484628> hi
general 2022-08-04 02:42:01 i see you got your ranks back
general 2022-08-04 02:43:03 what did you have before
general 2022-08-04 02:43:36 oh
general 2022-08-04 11:37:25 what is dcs
general 2022-08-04 11:42:30 absolutely destroyed
general 2022-08-04 11:46:24 very political in chat
general 2022-08-04 11:48:17 indonesia major l
general 2022-08-04 12:54:27 your sleep schedule is absolutely fucked
general 2022-08-04 12:55:34 that's a bit better
general 2022-08-04 12:58:38 he invented the microwave
general 2022-08-04 13:00:57 why specifically september the 19th
general 2022-08-04 13:01:10 2005 is in 4 months
general 2022-08-04 13:02:22 it would be funny
general 2022-08-04 13:03:26 you have to use pov-ray
general 2022-08-04 13:03:54 extremely easy to use (totally)
general 2022-08-04 13:04:43 i was talking about pov-ray but ok
general 2022-08-04 13:05:59 i can't do anything in blender
general 2022-08-04 13:06:15 except import models and move them
general 2022-08-04 13:07:10 what modelling software do you use
general 2022-08-04 13:07:45 yeah
general 2022-08-04 13:07:50 oh ok
general 2022-08-04 13:08:41 need to use this thing
general 2022-08-04 13:08:59 only problem is that you need to figure out how to get this built
general 2022-08-04 13:09:09 and you need a sony news workstation
general 2022-08-04 13:12:35 but at least it has better z-sorting and the ability to save models as asm bsp (the superfx proprietary format), and .cad/.nca files
general 2022-08-04 13:12:49 which are proprietary formats again
general 2022-08-04 13:16:04 i don't remember if i checked all of these
general 2022-08-04 13:37:02 kersal massive
general 2022-08-04 13:48:43 hi
general 2022-08-04 15:29:12 what are you making
general 2022-08-04 15:29:37 wow
general 2022-08-04 15:29:42 what type of game
general 2022-08-04 15:38:07 tilted towers
general 2022-08-04 22:26:48 that’s something at least
general 2022-08-04 22:27:15 but idk if they’ll do anything because discord support is terrible
general 2022-08-05 00:05:45 wow you're still alive
general 2022-08-05 10:01:44 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/962762700088295444/998626630056558642/redditsave.com_6gwg6naacac91.gif
general 2022-08-05 10:14:55 why ruin the low poly
general 2022-08-05 10:15:02 5 dollar fortnite
general 2022-08-05 10:15:32 i love the low poly aesthetic of early 3d games
general 2022-08-05 10:15:56 ex-zodiac feels like a model 2 arcade game
general 2022-08-05 10:16:12 because of the use of samples from the time
general 2022-08-05 10:16:33 i know the capcom electric guitar is there, and roland r-8 drums
general 2022-08-05 10:19:15 still working on that game?
general 2022-08-05 10:20:03 ah ok
general 2022-08-05 10:21:28 i hate the new gmail
general 2022-08-05 10:22:01 french kill
general 2022-08-05 10:22:02 good
general 2022-08-05 10:26:01 15/10/1993 starfox 2 mockup
general 2022-08-05 10:26:06 from the assets
general 2022-08-05 10:26:32 very early assets from starfox 2
general 2022-08-05 10:26:39 it is not a bad game
general 2022-08-05 10:26:42 it is incredible
general 2022-08-05 10:28:43 this is the really good post-final debug build source
general 2022-08-05 10:28:54 it has many unused things
general 2022-08-05 10:30:13 i have a 9 second video that is 100mb
general 2022-08-05 10:31:29 video is potentially broken
general 2022-08-05 10:31:34 this is ancient
general 2022-08-05 10:32:51 this is the intro of all time
general 2022-08-05 10:34:15 for 1989 hardware intended for 2d graphics, it's absolutely insane for the time
general 2022-08-05 10:34:27 with a 1992 expansion chip as well
general 2022-08-05 10:34:34 the <:fx:986629563440316526>
general 2022-08-05 10:38:19 the forbidden bat4.asm and bat5.asm
general 2022-08-05 10:38:43 there is only meant to be 3 battle maps
general 2022-08-05 10:44:17 more proof of a 1993 build of starfox 2 being real
general 2022-08-05 11:18:05 are people actually going to play pc2
general 2022-08-05 11:23:19 honestly the hype has died down a lot
general 2022-08-05 11:23:41 guy's already banned
general 2022-08-05 11:23:49 for doxxing himself
general 2022-08-05 12:15:01 it kind of gets boring
general 2022-08-05 12:21:36 i’ll be surprised if pc2 comes out at all
general 2022-08-05 12:22:42 says the release window for pc2, then sends a video of lava 4 months later
general 2022-08-05 12:23:26 the rickje experience
general 2022-08-05 12:23:40 at least share some evidence
general 2022-08-05 12:24:00 we know there’s a bunch of test places for new features
general 2022-08-05 12:24:29 i have to go find them again
general 2022-08-05 12:24:37 give me a minute
general 2022-08-05 12:24:49 hi fvl
general 2022-08-05 12:26:43

general 2022-08-05 12:30:33 most of them are wiped
general 2022-08-05 12:30:52 wrong screenshot
general 2022-08-05 12:31:20 
general 2022-08-05 12:31:35 this is the right one

general 2022-08-06 12:37:08 your exploit is an ip grabber
general 2022-08-06 12:38:05 have you checked with multiple antiviruses
general 2022-08-06 12:38:21 what ones
general 2022-08-06 12:38:44 windows defender
general 2022-08-06 12:38:53 at least check with another program
general 2022-08-06 12:38:59 not just windows defender
general 2022-08-06 12:39:10 idk i use malwarebytes
general 2022-08-06 12:39:26 i personally wouldn't download any exploits

general 2022-08-06 12:43:45 mate your exploit is probably an ip grabber
general 2022-08-06 12:45:51 https://youtu.be/Q3SOYneC7mU

general 2022-08-06 12:54:16 
general 2022-08-06 12:55:45 those moving textures are going to destroy performance
general 2022-08-06 12:55:46 totally
general 2022-08-06 12:56:18 nah they won't really impact performance
general 2022-08-06 12:56:21 i was joking

general 2022-08-08 08:56:33 yousuf i can now rebuild the interleaved texture files for fx trax
general 2022-08-08 08:57:00 the problem was that the texture files were missing
general 2022-08-08 08:57:05 so i ripped them from rom
general 2022-08-08 08:57:23 yes i actually did something fx trax related again

general 2022-08-08 08:58:43 i can't do anything with blender lmao
general 2022-08-08 08:58:54 except move models

general 2022-08-08 09:27:50 they have a whole palette and texture for a 9 second screen in vortex

general 2022-08-13 08:12:07 that's why he can't answer in chat

general 2022-08-14 10:42:28 there's just so many classic titles that have made a permanent impact
general 2022-08-14 10:42:43 shut up about it
general 2022-08-14 10:43:58 dylan just casually confirming there were multiple 1993 builds of starfox 2

general 2022-08-14 10:58:39 going to look through the .bin files for the ji30-6a source
general 2022-08-14 10:58:49 i already know there's 1 texture that is different
general 2022-08-14 11:11:30 i assembled an entire file and just realised that i was doing the wrong build
general 2022-08-14 11:11:36 this one has minimal changes
general 2022-08-14 11:11:56 i thought i was doing the build which crashes when andross talks lmao
general 2022-08-14 11:13:49 here it is
general 2022-08-14 12:07:47 it's all coming together
general 2022-08-14 12:07:56

general 2022-08-15 06:00:49 literally easiest program edit
general 2022-08-15 06:01:16 i used yychr to find the location of the texture binaries in vortex
general 2022-08-15 06:02:08 since all argonaut - nintendo superfx games have the superfx textures at 0x90000
general 2022-08-15 06:02:41 vortex wasn't developed by nintendo so the original tool didn't work
general 2022-08-15 06:03:10 yeah that is worse
general 2022-08-15 06:09:26 vsnes has a superfx texture viewer but you can't save the individual files
general 2022-08-15 06:09:34 yeah i agree
general 2022-08-15 06:10:06 so smart
general 2022-08-15 06:14:59 remember when kyruz doxxed himself because someone called him british

general 2022-08-18 05:46:17 starfox 2 strategy guide?
general 2022-08-18 05:46:19 since when
general 2022-08-18 05:49:58 but nothing will beat the comprehensive maps from the released design document
general 2022-08-18 05:50:20 even has each individual step for the space encounters
general 2022-08-18 07:38:09 i just have like a basic build of starfox 2 in my ultrastarfox 2 folder for some reason
general 2022-08-18 07:38:14 idk what i used it for
general 2022-08-18 07:38:53 it has the fps counter enabled, expert mode unlocked, and homing shots enabled by default
general 2022-08-18 07:39:53 literally nothing else different i think
general 2022-08-18 07:41:11 the starfox 2 hud design is great
general 2022-08-18 08:24:59 starfox 2 started out as a 2 player test and the 2 player mode was removed after the wces build
general 2022-08-18 08:25:02 sad
general 2022-08-18 08:37:39 where the fuck is the logo palette
general 2022-08-18 08:37:54 not used to starfox 2's source (it's a disaster)
general 2022-08-18 08:38:11 i already know for sure that it's not in the crunched palettes
general 2022-08-18 09:19:41 no
general 2022-08-18 09:53:06 found the title palette
general 2022-08-18 09:53:18 matches up perfectly so far
general 2022-08-18 09:53:49 now time to recreate this
general 2022-08-18 10:14:44 and you can change it
general 2022-08-18 10:15:49 there seems to be a bug with the whole title fade
general 2022-08-18 10:16:19 the colours displayed have 1 less value in all colour channels when compared to the source
general 2022-08-18 10:16:33 i think the fade hasn't entirely finished
general 2022-08-18 10:45:07 skill issue
general 2022-08-18 10:45:24

general 2022-08-20 08:30:09 not going to spoil the game but the 2nd half is incredible
general 2022-08-20 08:30:18 soundtrack wise
general 2022-08-20 08:31:51 like the starfox 1 main theme wouldn't be the same on the megadrive's sound hardware
general 2022-08-20 08:45:57 one thing i noticed is that starfox 2 doesn't use the heavy guitar as much as the original
general 2022-08-20 08:49:18 i can name only a few tracks that use the heavy guitar in starfox 2, and those are both venom tracks, both macbeth tracks, and both eladard tracks
general 2022-08-20 08:51:02 in starfox 1 almost every track which uses the "band" instrument set has the heavy guitar sample

general 2022-08-21 13:46:08 i still wish that the early maps can be restored
general 2022-08-21 13:46:15 like the 1993 era stuff
general 2022-08-21 13:46:20 because we have those maps
general 2022-08-21 13:47:15 yes but i don't really care about the lore
general 2022-08-21 13:47:25 i just like the gameplay
general 2022-08-21 13:48:08 i've only really played the original snes titles so i haven't had much exposure to the lore
general 2022-08-21 13:48:37 both games basically go "andross is going to take over the lylat system and corneria"
general 2022-08-21 13:48:40 stop him

general 2022-08-21 13:51:23 these are all either late 1993/early 1994
general 2022-08-21 13:51:39 i think a couple of them referenced the dancing insector boss from starfox 1
general 2022-08-21 13:52:59 
general 2022-08-21 13:55:43 no
general 2022-08-21 13:59:20 oh yeah there was a mode involving 3d glasses planned in starfox 2
general 2022-08-21 13:59:29 we have the palette for it
general 2022-08-21 14:00:30 and it's in the starfox 2 early prototype restoration hack
general 2022-08-21 14:00:56 which uses real source code from 1994
general 2022-08-21 22:20:38 the inevitable

general 2022-08-25 06:16:22 i still love this transition from wces
general 2022-08-25 06:16:27 there's nothing like it in the final
general 2022-08-25 06:16:41 1995
general 2022-08-25 06:17:01 actually wait no the wces build is from december 1994
general 2022-08-25 06:17:22 which game
general 2022-08-25 06:17:53 street fighter 2 is a classic
general 2022-08-25 06:18:05 never got into fighting games though
general 2022-08-25 06:18:37 the game's ost must have the megaman x guitar
general 2022-08-25 06:19:37 i think the actual source for the mmx guitar is from l-cd1
general 2022-08-25 06:19:42 starfox 2
general 2022-08-25 06:20:06 which is a really good snes game
general 2022-08-25 06:20:28 starfox 2 uses the full clock speed of the superfx chip, which is 21.7mhz
general 2022-08-25 06:20:36 starfox 1 had the clock divider on
general 2022-08-25 06:20:50 which is why it's so much slower
general 2022-08-25 06:25:56 the main difference between the gsu-1 chip and the gsu-2 chip (superfx 1 and 2), is the compatibility for 16mbit roms
general 2022-08-25 06:27:33 there's actually a way to make starfox 1 and 2 run at 30 or 60fps
general 2022-08-25 06:27:49 you only need a cpu overclock
general 2022-08-25 06:28:50 what the fuck
general 2022-08-25 06:29:59 need to play the superfx racing game
general 2022-08-25 06:30:01 stunt race fx

general 2022-08-25 10:00:26 i went through the tutorial and that's all i could do
general 2022-08-25 10:00:44 i regret speedrunning the tutorial

general 2022-08-25 13:23:18 i can't believe i didn't go back to the kirby super star ost after playing it back in 2017
general 2022-08-25 13:23:39 the main theme for meta knight's revenge is a classic
general 2022-08-25 13:39:19 "you literal black" - 4drxw the alcoholic
general 2022-08-25 13:43:03 damaging the stylus and the record

general 2022-08-25 13:43:21 oh wait i just realised it's one of those
general 2022-08-25 13:44:48 not an actual turntable, it's fake scrubbing
general 2022-08-25 13:46:48 vgm is more respectable

general 2022-08-28 13:50:55 boss roll theme but with the original string sample
general 2022-08-28 13:52:16 0:28 is when the real part kicks in
general 2022-08-29 04:02:40 who cares about ranks
general 2022-08-29 04:03:16 that's an exception
general 2022-08-29 05:40:59 it's so clean compared to the snes version
general 2022-08-29 06:11:02 i can't be bothered to restore what i can of the main theme
general 2022-08-29 06:11:13 there's too many instruments i have to get

general 2022-08-30 13:23:00 you can’t accurately gauge how good a game is through videos
general 2022-08-30 13:23:32 you’re not playing it so you can only assume you’ll enjoy it
general 2022-08-30 13:27:07 ex-zodiac is in early access and it’s amazing already
general 2022-08-30 13:27:32 lots of polish and great gameplay
general 2022-08-30 13:48:09 maybe do something less illegal
general 2022-08-30 13:48:56 idk wouldn’t trust those sorts of places ever

general 2022-08-31 10:40:32 i actually won a round of clam blitz

general 2022-08-31 10:48:21 i’m mad that i didn’t discover the power of the literal gun rather than a stupid paint roller
general 2022-08-31 11:35:50 sad
general 2022-08-31 11:39:51 if he would release it, it would be the last day or almost the last day
general 2022-08-31 11:40:08 but i doubt it would be released yet lol

general 2022-08-31 13:04:12 i don't get the kid named finger meme
general 2022-08-31 13:04:18 it makes no sense
general 2022-08-31 13:13:24 i have to get the special image for the end of this year next month
general 2022-08-31 13:13:41 i did it last year and it was funny
general 2022-08-31 13:21:28 do not
general 2022-08-31 13:21:34 it will fall apart
general 2022-08-31 13:21:44 since all french things are made of francium
general 2022-08-31 22:28:01 but literally nothing happened
general 2022-09-01 05:54:10 piracy
general 2022-09-01 05:59:25 it’s logical
general 2022-09-01 05:59:29 it’s not stupid
general 2022-09-01 06:00:12 i would support the devs personally
general 2022-09-01 06:01:11 if the game is currently on sale, piracy isn’t good at all
general 2022-09-01 06:01:37 but if they’re not offering a way to play it, then go ahead
general 2022-09-01 06:02:08 more with old games
general 2022-09-01 06:02:47 nah
general 2022-09-01 06:07:46 if you need to save up to buy a game, then do that
general 2022-09-01 06:07:53 just support the devs
general 2022-09-01 09:54:43 what's it about?
general 2022-09-01 10:19:37 oh ok
general 2022-09-01 10:29:42 it is coming though
general 2022-09-01 10:31:23 destroyed
general 2022-09-01 10:32:20 the date of the fog
general 2022-09-01 10:32:31 it will happen
general 2022-09-01 10:33:45 yeah it was weird
general 2022-09-01 10:33:49 that would be funny
general 2022-09-01 10:36:28 https://tenor.com/view/jixaw-xd-toss-off-approach-the-bus-insurance-iamgoingtosellthisman-gif-25852348
general 2022-09-01 10:38:01 <@370594904268734464> the early training stage actually works in the demo
general 2022-09-01 10:38:06 like fully functional
general 2022-09-01 10:38:54 the dialog for sea.tscn also works in the demo as well, the dialog system worked differently in the demo
general 2022-09-01 10:46:24 there's like 2 other levels that i can't get to load at all
general 2022-09-01 10:46:43 one is an early version of stage 1
general 2022-09-01 10:47:20 and the other is a very early version of euclides belt (probably)
general 2022-09-01 10:47:34 that's not great lol
general 2022-09-01 10:53:28 these are the 2 stages i can't load at all
general 2022-09-01 10:54:12 https://youtu.be/5-wT4h4h2pM?t=21 i know for a fact that stage_debug is this, since the dialog is there in the stage file
general 2022-09-01 10:54:43 the space stage idk
general 2022-09-01 10:55:25 could be an extremely early version of euclides belt or just a test area much like sea.tscn
general 2022-09-01 11:20:12 ^
general 2022-09-01 11:20:28 it's objectively bad
general 2022-09-01 11:21:02 they can't even be bothered to make a 64 bit client
general 2022-09-01 11:21:31 the issues were always there, they're now just coming into light
general 2022-09-01 11:23:37 yeah i give up on those 2 stages for now
general 2022-09-01 11:23:55 they're obviously meant for a way earlier version of ex-zodiac
general 2022-09-01 11:24:23 duncefi i always post my shit here despite this being a roblox discord
general 2022-09-01 11:27:21 i have like 4 different versions of this one tool from 2004
general 2022-09-01 11:27:29 all for different games

general 2022-09-01 11:28:37 wait that's 3
general 2022-09-01 11:28:44 shit
general 2022-09-01 11:29:14 oh yeah there was an experiment with the lunar chase (x) tech demo
general 2022-09-01 11:29:35 which doesn't use the superfx (idk why i thought fx textures would be in it)
general 2022-09-01 11:30:56 5 second slowmode
general 2022-09-01 11:31:03 fair enough

general 2022-09-03 14:28:28 they're now just being brought to light
general 2022-09-03 14:29:10 they are
general 2022-09-03 14:29:47 i didn't play in 2018
general 2022-09-03 14:30:03 i quit in 2017 and 2018
general 2022-09-03 14:30:08 barely touched roblox
general 2022-09-03 14:30:47 in 2017 and 2018 i was playing splat2, smo, and botw
general 2022-09-03 14:31:36 because fortnite was doing it
general 2022-09-03 14:31:40 that's it
general 2022-09-03 14:32:30 most items i have were bought with tix
general 2022-09-03 14:32:40 or won in events
general 2022-09-03 14:34:16 epic games is doing a better job with fortnite
general 2022-09-03 14:34:19 literally
general 2022-09-03 14:35:04 they're actually improving the game
general 2022-09-03 14:35:17 it was funny
general 2022-09-03 14:35:31 what's that
general 2022-09-03 14:36:00 i remember the game "welcome to roblox building"
general 2022-09-03 14:36:09 an official game released by roblox
general 2022-09-03 14:36:27 wtf is that
general 2022-09-03 14:36:46 sounds shit
general 2022-09-03 14:37:39 more interested in sweeping their problems under the rug rather than dealing with them properly
general 2022-09-03 14:40:55 it is him
general 2022-09-03 14:41:25 love getting dms for the most useless shit
general 2022-09-03 14:48:23 shep this server has changed since yousuf's departure
general 2022-09-03 14:51:50 worse
general 2022-09-03 14:52:34 wow a tunnel
general 2022-09-03 14:52:42 what a valuable piece of information
general 2022-09-03 14:53:34 radio
general 2022-09-03 14:54:44 yeah seems legit
general 2022-09-03 15:00:39 we need to pull off a starfox 1 moment
general 2022-09-03 15:00:46 venom tunnel sequence
general 2022-09-03 15:01:47 hi
general 2022-09-03 15:04:01 there's only one answer to the tunnel and it's the venom highway sequence
general 2022-09-03 15:05:56 might be a good idea to not have a username that is extremely similar to yousuf's
general 2022-09-03 15:06:13 since you'll get tons of pings from people who don't know that he retired
general 2022-09-03 15:06:34 it's using the original instruments
general 2022-09-03 15:06:44 you familiar with starfox 1 or something?
general 2022-09-03 15:07:13 no need to be like that mate

general 2022-09-03 15:07:39 i can recover that picture
general 2022-09-03 15:07:50 no
general 2022-09-03 15:07:54 other methods
general 2022-09-03 15:08:09 involves going through the files
general 2022-09-03 15:10:10 i have power
general 2022-09-03 15:14:23 and space armada had that one weird ship with a tunnel
general 2022-09-03 15:16:54 so good how you just posted the windmill in chat

general 2022-09-03 15:20:42 leon you were here for a while you should know this
general 2022-09-03 15:21:00 it is a dumpster fire
general 2022-09-03 15:21:05 not as bad as boxness though
general 2022-09-03 15:21:14 yeah true
general 2022-09-03 15:21:21 alright bye
general 2022-09-03 15:22:11 it's changed a lot
general 2022-09-03 15:23:01 how embed fail
general 2022-09-03 15:23:05 you have image perms
general 2022-09-03 15:23:43 
general 2022-09-03 15:25:34 about time
general 2022-09-03 15:25:56 it'll eventually happen
general 2022-09-03 15:25:57 maybe
general 2022-09-03 15:26:16 yeah
general 2022-09-03 15:26:39 i have never changed my name colour since i got expert
general 2022-09-03 15:26:58 i selected some blue colours at first then landed on bright blue
general 2022-09-03 15:27:05 never looked back
general 2022-09-03 15:27:32 plane crazy gigaleak
general 2022-09-03 15:27:38 all source files
general 2022-09-03 15:28:09 exactly like the nintendo gigaleaks
general 2022-09-03 15:28:30 https://tenor.com/view/roblox-steam-drake-teaching-meme-gif-24494590
general 2022-09-03 15:29:05 he's got a bunch of test places for pc2
general 2022-09-03 15:29:21 most of them are locked
general 2022-09-03 15:29:36 a few of them are open but they're just the same baseplate
general 2022-09-03 15:30:58 stunt race fx restored just sounds wrong
general 2022-09-03 15:31:34 
general 2022-09-03 15:31:54 this is using the original instruments and the sequence data
general 2022-09-03 15:33:59 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/762404665408880642/1011259449010290708/the_bronze_age.gif
general 2022-09-03 15:35:46 enjoy some restored starfox 2 tracks
general 2022-09-03 15:35:59 
general 2022-09-03 15:36:57 the strings just have a different feel in the restored version of astropolis
general 2022-09-03 15:39:23 starfox 2's ost is just so different compared to hirasawa's tracks for starfox 1
general 2022-09-03 15:39:45 less reliance on the heavy guitar
general 2022-09-03 15:41:03 it's really only used in the venom tracks (which hirasawa presumably composed since it's in the starfox 1 alpha), eladard tracks, and the macbeth tracks
general 2022-09-03 15:41:31 i like to ramble on about snes related stuff
general 2022-09-03 15:43:56 forgot about the alternate pilot select theme when you get every single pepper medal, which is corneria from starfox 1
general 2022-09-03 15:45:31 
general 2022-09-03 15:45:42 i assume most people here know what regular corneria sounds like
general 2022-09-03 15:45:51 it's one of the most iconic starfox tracks
general 2022-09-03 15:46:17 the instrumentation of the starfox 2 port is slightly different
general 2022-09-03 15:47:50 yeah that's it
general 2022-09-03 15:48:36 make sure to react with radio since it's been just radio silence since july
general 2022-09-03 15:53:35 it's about time i "restored" another starfox 1 track
general 2022-09-03 15:59:16 a new full restore
general 2022-09-03 16:03:55 what
general 2022-09-03 16:03:57 the face?
general 2022-09-03 16:05:52 i've never seen faces like that on roblox
general 2022-09-03 16:06:40 i don't even know what roblox is doing with the avatar system now
general 2022-09-03 16:07:14 like i play roblox sometimes but not really
general 2022-09-03 16:08:52 the app from ms store?
general 2022-09-03 16:09:37 i thought you could only get it from ms store
general 2022-09-03 16:25:19 and another restore just right after
general 2022-09-03 16:52:12 i am going
general 2022-09-03 16:52:17 really late
general 2022-09-04 01:27:43 what happened to all your ranks
general 2022-09-04 01:28:13 oh ok
general 2022-09-04 02:05:56 hi seed
general 2022-09-04 02:06:18 i thought my switch online free trial ended but i still have some time
general 2022-09-04 02:33:18 the entire splatoon 3 story got leaked
general 2022-09-04 02:33:33 incredible
general 2022-09-04 02:40:46 no
general 2022-09-04 02:40:50 find it yourself
general 2022-09-04 02:41:09 also love how the thumbnails clearly show spoilers
general 2022-09-04 02:56:10 good
general 2022-09-04 02:56:51 last day of me playing splat2 until i have to pay 60 dollars for an online subscription
general 2022-09-04 05:28:45 another new "restore"
general 2022-09-04 05:28:50 would sound so good if properly done
general 2022-09-04 05:55:01 
general 2022-09-04 06:31:12 sound effects need to be found to fully restore the starfox ost
general 2022-09-04 06:31:46 since the briefing theme uses an explosion sample
general 2022-09-04 06:31:51 the same one that's used in game
general 2022-09-04 06:32:14 as well as the sound effects associated with many enemies
general 2022-09-04 07:36:41 hi
general 2022-09-04 07:51:53 i wish i could get the images from the narc source code to display
general 2022-09-04 07:51:58 very funny drug dealer game
general 2022-09-04 07:52:47 they're .iso files so idk
general 2022-09-04 07:53:59 well that's something
general 2022-09-04 07:54:32 seems like these iso files are a bunch of images grouped together
general 2022-09-04 08:22:14 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/762404665408880642/1011259449010290708/the_bronze_age.gif
general 2022-09-04 08:38:04 progress on getting the narc logo separated from the other images in the .bdd file
general 2022-09-04 08:38:24 it's there but the dimensions are funky with tiles
general 2022-09-04 08:41:38 there are various headers inside the files which mark the start of each digitised image
general 2022-09-04 08:41:46 don't know what they mean
general 2022-09-04 08:54:03 we have utes here
general 2022-09-04 09:19:00 wonder where the original targa digitisations are for narc
general 2022-09-04 09:19:12 they're probably lost
general 2022-09-04 09:22:48 yeah
general 2022-09-04 10:32:03 somebody made a buildable version of the narc source code
general 2022-09-04 10:32:28 doesn't work on windows
general 2022-09-04 11:07:21 have you heard of springtrapkiller's server
bot-central 2022-09-04 11:07:55 !rank
general 2022-09-04 11:08:04 i am level 62
general 2022-09-04 11:08:23 2 levels
general 2022-09-04 11:10:42 most confusing change
general 2022-09-04 13:01:41 archiving this
general 2022-09-04 13:03:08 all those people i still have added from 2015 but inactive
general 2022-09-04 13:04:37 everyone knows the main halberd theme but the other one is often overlooked
general 2022-09-04 13:04:50 not as good as the 1st one
general 2022-09-04 13:05:58 idk how to switch it on lol
general 2022-09-04 13:20:36 thanos7468's alt
general 2022-09-04 13:21:13 no i'm saying that duncefi is his alt
general 2022-09-04 13:21:23 used to be really fucking obvious lmao
general 2022-09-04 13:21:38 it's been changed now
general 2022-09-04 13:23:53 the car
general 2022-09-04 13:27:01 i still don't know the song
general 2022-09-04 23:22:37 he has an alcohol addiction
general 2022-09-04 23:54:13 reliable
general 2022-09-05 01:27:00 he is
general 2022-09-05 01:52:57 no it’s because of life
general 2022-09-05 01:53:27 yeah
general 2022-09-05 02:34:33 clipped it
general 2022-09-05 02:35:01 pug posted goku’s feet
general 2022-09-05 03:01:03 
general 2022-09-05 03:01:16 i am the master of screenshotting
general 2022-09-05 03:02:25 lazy method
general 2022-09-05 03:03:07 fail lol
general 2022-09-05 03:04:15 pcc moderation is just going to fall apart soon
general 2022-09-05 03:04:23 i can sense it
general 2022-09-05 03:10:09 i've got an arcade game that i can't stream here at all
general 2022-09-05 03:10:31 because it's all about drugs
general 2022-09-05 03:10:56 and it's violent
general 2022-09-05 03:23:25 the real goal of work at a pizza place is to blow up the kitchen by putting cans of drink in the ovens
general 2022-09-05 03:24:19 it is what it is
general 2022-09-05 03:26:50 better hardware
general 2022-09-05 03:28:48 no clue i've never played that game
general 2022-09-05 05:01:39 devs couldn't make a proper star fox game
general 2022-09-05 05:03:45 what's the point
general 2022-09-05 05:04:17 cinematics
general 2022-09-05 05:05:08 fair enough
general 2022-09-05 05:05:58 this will be in it
general 2022-09-05 05:07:14 idk ask scott
general 2022-09-05 05:32:32 idk anything about gundam
general 2022-09-05 09:22:49 good idea
general 2022-09-05 09:27:49 theotokos
general 2022-09-05 09:29:12 who cares
general 2022-09-05 09:29:21 i only use the client
general 2022-09-05 09:32:00 yeah opera gx was literally made to be the "gaming browser"
general 2022-09-05 09:33:40 well i mean you did ask "name one gamer aesthetic"
general 2022-09-05 09:36:50 i don't really have a problem with opera gx but the whole "gaming browser" thing and the various sponsorships make it look sort of like a gimmick
general 2022-09-05 09:38:43 did you know the entire tiktok source code is really vulnerable
general 2022-09-05 09:39:08 yeah someone got in lmao
general 2022-09-05 09:39:09 https://twitter.com/aggressivecurl/status/1566161198248509440
general 2022-09-05 09:39:50 twitter isn't that bad if you look in the right places
general 2022-09-05 09:40:45 it's still not that bad
general 2022-09-05 09:41:45 now that is good
general 2022-09-05 09:42:13 there's no issue it's just very gimmicky
general 2022-09-05 09:42:35 looks bad
general 2022-09-05 09:43:00 the entire identity of opera gx is the gimmicky stuff
general 2022-09-05 09:43:06 not a great public view
general 2022-09-05 09:43:24 yeah
general 2022-09-05 09:44:17 safari
general 2022-09-05 09:44:20 the mindset
general 2022-09-05 09:44:48 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1016282295545634816
general 2022-09-05 09:45:11 people only look at the gimmicky stuff since that's what's advertised
general 2022-09-05 09:45:43 take that all away and you just get regular opera
general 2022-09-05 09:47:23 yeah i know but what's the point of having gx if you take away the "gamer" stuff
general 2022-09-05 09:47:30 you're just left with regular opera
general 2022-09-05 09:48:29 the system resource management is the only useful feature
general 2022-09-05 09:48:41 i had gx but deleted it
general 2022-09-05 09:49:03 you need to use mario tennis browser
general 2022-09-05 09:49:39 
general 2022-09-05 09:50:25 yeah it doesn't have any downsides but the "gamer" branding just puts me off
general 2022-09-05 09:51:26 vibe space sub test in new enclosure 9,000watt max power
general 2022-09-05 09:52:42 why get an extension when you already have it built in
general 2022-09-05 09:53:05 it's the funniest place
general 2022-09-05 09:57:46 https://youtu.be/D7iSy0Jsi6g ok go check this out
general 2022-09-05 09:57:54 ex-zodiac has a killer ost
general 2022-09-05 09:58:52 i've got the entire ost in flac and it just sounds more full
general 2022-09-05 09:59:19 iirc the roland r-8 is heavily used throughout the ost
general 2022-09-05 09:59:27 stage 6 uses the megaman x guitar sample
general 2022-09-05 10:02:57 the roland r-8 is also used in the hyper duel arcade ost
general 2022-09-05 10:03:01 which is also really good
general 2022-09-05 10:08:05 the segapcm chip shipped with hang-on in 1985 was cutting edge for arcade boards at the time, it stayed until virtua racing on the cg board which released in 1992
general 2022-09-05 10:09:01 power drift is a much better example of this but after burner is one of the most iconic super scalers
general 2022-09-05 10:09:40 hiro actually sampled live guitars for use in after burner
general 2022-09-05 10:09:51 it was on a dat tape that's sadly lost
general 2022-09-05 10:10:53 multipcm came after, first appearing in virtua racing as a dual chip setup (the only cg board game to have a dual multipcm setup)
general 2022-09-05 10:11:08 it's basically cd quality
general 2022-09-05 10:12:02 but why
general 2022-09-05 10:14:43 hipster what server is that in your bio
general 2022-09-05 10:22:00 france bombed that place
general 2022-09-05 10:22:06 don't you remember?
general 2022-09-05 10:22:13 on international french day
general 2022-09-05 10:22:37 it is the great journey
general 2022-09-05 10:23:47 france will bomb indonesia next year
general 2022-09-05 10:24:12 they're only doing this to countries in south east asia
general 2022-09-05 10:24:21 they prepare for a year
general 2022-09-05 10:24:26 every time
general 2022-09-05 10:24:47 it's the only good thing france has done
general 2022-09-05 10:24:52 think about it
general 2022-09-05 10:25:21 https://tenor.com/view/half-life-gordon-freeman-no-way-half-life2-gordon-gif-22072856
general 2022-09-05 10:25:56 you get the full international french day event order

general 2022-09-12 12:57:19 there's a few more
general 2022-09-12 14:05:28 that’s true
general 2022-09-13 07:39:40 most definitely edited
general 2022-09-13 07:40:03 different compression artefacts on both messages
general 2022-09-13 07:40:12 different colour

general 2022-09-13 13:05:24 the goal of splatoon 3 is to get the dab emote at level 98
general 2022-09-13 13:08:52 of course not
general 2022-09-13 13:11:22 there would be people here stupid enough to believe that shit lol
general 2022-09-13 13:11:28 let him explain
general 2022-09-13 13:12:22 oh yeah why post the link lmao
general 2022-09-13 13:13:54 discord mobile users can accidentally click on that link because of how shit the app is
general 2022-09-13 13:14:22 might be a better idea to delete the entire message
general 2022-09-13 13:16:06 do it yourself
general 2022-09-13 13:16:30 action is more likely to be taken if you don't rely on a bunch of people to do the work for you
general 2022-09-13 13:16:58 the one ever
general 2022-09-13 13:20:38 the most confusing argument
general 2022-09-13 13:52:28 hi
general 2022-09-13 13:54:28 fair enough
general 2022-09-13 14:00:43 lmao they disabled chat for the nintendo direct
general 2022-09-13 14:01:27 some livestream where they show games that only 10% of people care about
general 2022-09-13 14:01:38 and they sometimes show something decent

general 2022-09-13 14:11:33 he's still racist
general 2022-09-14 11:02:38 it would be funny
general 2022-09-15 05:39:36 the waste of money
general 2022-09-15 05:51:32 wait really?
general 2022-09-15 05:51:47 i thought it was still paid
general 2022-09-15 05:52:19 i’d rather not

general 2022-09-15 13:25:22 the worst mistake you could make
general 2022-09-15 13:33:13 they're so shit
general 2022-09-15 23:51:31 we don’t care
general 2022-09-15 23:51:40 roblox is a shit platform
general 2022-09-15 23:52:33 because you’re begging i’m not going to sub
general 2022-09-15 23:52:49 hi nevada
general 2022-09-16 02:36:30 nah you were in like a femboy gc or something
general 2022-09-16 02:42:41 nah this was talked about before
general 2022-09-16 04:56:14 yeah that's comedi
general 2022-09-16 05:17:39 a lot of not good things
general 2022-09-16 05:23:45 alright good
general 2022-09-16 05:30:30 shitty roblox driving game
general 2022-09-16 06:00:33 never play league of legends
general 2022-09-16 06:38:08 you just posted this
general 2022-09-16 06:38:12 why again
general 2022-09-16 06:47:30 <@412694102006824960> i think you might like this
general 2022-09-16 06:51:25 with all the original instrument sources
general 2022-09-16 06:52:03 
general 2022-09-16 06:52:04 i've done a few more as well, none as complete as these
general 2022-09-16 06:52:56 sadly i can't do any of the tracks that use the "band" instrument set since only a handful of samples have been found from them
general 2022-09-16 06:53:50 that includes basically almost all the planet themes, boss themes, continue screen, and the stage clear/death themes for them
general 2022-09-16 06:55:12 somebody has put together a partially restored version of corneria though (i don't think some of the samples are original though)
general 2022-09-16 06:55:17 thanks
general 2022-09-16 06:56:54 the snare definitely isn't original
general 2022-09-16 06:58:01 i could've done a few starfox 2 tracks but almost every "orchestra" set track has this bass sample that isn't from starfox 1
general 2022-09-16 06:59:36 i have experimented with starfox 2 tracks but there's not enough for a full sample replacement job
general 2022-09-16 07:02:07 yeah good idea
general 2022-09-16 07:02:44 something else that's partially done
general 2022-09-17 02:32:07 that message was from 3 months ago
general 2022-09-17 13:37:25 wtf
general 2022-09-17 13:38:35 why do people put so much effort into that lol
general 2022-09-18 10:36:40 i had a feeling rick would just make another false deadline
general 2022-09-18 10:36:50 turns out i'm probably right
general 2022-09-18 10:52:08 why again <#537387160261885962>
general 2022-09-18 10:54:38 maybe say something without being an asshole
general 2022-09-18 10:56:51 actually something i can agree with
general 2022-09-18 10:57:10 you can't expect realism in a block game
general 2022-09-18 10:59:38 learn
general 2022-09-18 11:38:12 yeah that's what i was talking about
general 2022-09-18 11:38:25 although there is still a chance of it being fake
general 2022-09-18 11:38:34 a very low chance
general 2022-09-18 11:38:47 i have the entire rar folder
general 2022-09-18 11:39:07 90 videos all up
general 2022-09-18 13:13:49 actually p2w
general 2022-09-18 13:14:05 we will not
general 2022-09-18 13:14:29 at least hipster isn't wasting money on a gacha game
general 2022-09-18 13:15:12 i just want to buy the game and nothing else
general 2022-09-18 13:15:20 no microtransactions
general 2022-09-18 13:15:28 no dlc
general 2022-09-18 13:15:41 although the splatoon 2 dlc was really good
general 2022-09-18 13:17:59 well i mean the early access version of ex-zodiac is on steam but you probably won't be interested in it
general 2022-09-18 13:18:18 it's like starfox
general 2022-09-18 13:18:22 but not starfox
general 2022-09-18 13:18:36 but also starfox at the same time
general 2022-09-18 13:18:58 it's low poly
general 2022-09-18 13:19:24 sort of like a cg board game, but technically more like a model 2 game
general 2022-09-18 13:19:38 the cg board had no texture support
general 2022-09-18 13:21:39 readbeand is worse since he spent money on the game
general 2022-09-18 13:21:59 same as springtrapkiller
general 2022-09-18 13:22:14 yeah
general 2022-09-18 13:22:20 fair enough
general 2022-09-18 13:22:34 good
general 2022-09-18 13:22:52 yes
general 2022-09-18 13:23:27 that guy in pcc who spent money in azure lane
general 2022-09-18 13:23:59 true
general 2022-09-18 13:24:20 p2w isn't something i would do with my own money
general 2022-09-18 13:25:13 terrible gameplay but tons of cosmetics
general 2022-09-18 13:25:34 i saw that capcom made a megaman x gacha game
general 2022-09-18 13:25:38 absolute shame
general 2022-09-18 13:25:51 they do
general 2022-09-18 13:26:06 the x series was incredible
general 2022-09-18 13:28:03 capcom used to mean quality
general 2022-09-18 13:57:18 hipster the gta 6 thing is real
general 2022-09-18 13:57:20 confirmed
general 2022-09-18 13:57:39 rockstar are removing comments that mention the leak
general 2022-09-19 00:04:10 pcc really isn’t that bad
general 2022-09-19 00:04:26 boxness server is worse
general 2022-09-19 00:04:43 as well as many other places out there
general 2022-09-19 00:06:42 obc prepare for whatever is going to happen lol
general 2022-09-19 00:07:09 i don’t even know why they’re doing this
general 2022-09-19 00:08:55 what the fuck
general 2022-09-19 00:30:48 i go to his likes on twitter and the first image is a child
general 2022-09-19 00:31:06 i just looked through the google doc
general 2022-09-19 00:31:22 it’s very concerning
general 2022-09-19 00:31:52 i don’t want to see more info
general 2022-09-19 00:33:06 of course you would be suspended if you say that
general 2022-09-19 00:33:40 thinks it’s “natural” or some shit
general 2022-09-19 00:35:58 hipster there is a shitshow going on
general 2022-09-19 00:38:05 a lot happened before
general 2022-09-19 00:51:40 that alcoholic
general 2022-09-19 04:19:46 scripting is banned here
general 2022-09-19 12:48:16 <@412694102006824960> still doing stuff, wanted to do this one so badly since i started this but ended up being a bit disappointed
general 2022-09-19 12:57:30 spa why are you being an asshole
general 2022-09-19 13:06:10 nope lol
general 2022-09-19 13:06:31 yeah moc likes children, extremely concerning
general 2022-09-19 13:06:42 calls it "natural"
general 2022-09-19 13:25:42 wait what
general 2022-09-19 13:26:12 this isn't the moc we're talking about
general 2022-09-19 13:55:54 trollface is older than many people here
general 2022-09-19 13:56:16 imagine not being older than trollface
general 2022-09-19 13:56:34 what thing
general 2022-09-19 13:58:16 not older than trollface
general 2022-09-19 14:00:30 i'm very inexperienced with ships so idk
general 2022-09-20 03:25:47 you get it off the workshop yourself
general 2022-09-20 03:28:11 skill issue

general 2022-09-20 07:10:05 or dodgy wire
general 2022-09-20 14:03:50 yeah i lost hope a long time ago
general 2022-09-20 14:04:09 rick just gives false deadlines to get hopes up
general 2022-09-20 15:20:13 where are your roles
general 2022-09-20 15:20:48 i swear he had an expert role
general 2022-09-21 09:16:22 it is the 21st night of september
general 2022-09-21 09:26:05 real
general 2022-09-21 10:51:46 at least increase the filesize limits for non-members
general 2022-09-21 10:51:57 8mb is way too low
general 2022-09-21 10:52:31 i shouldn't have to do that
general 2022-09-21 10:52:48 the base limit should be increased
general 2022-09-21 10:53:02 we aren't in the late 90's
general 2022-09-21 10:53:28 the 500mb is a good pull
general 2022-09-21 10:53:51 yeah i know
general 2022-09-21 10:54:11 but the sticker size limit can't be excused
general 2022-09-21 10:54:18 500kb for an apng
general 2022-09-21 10:54:49 the only way i can get animated stickers to fit is to compress the hell out of them
general 2022-09-21 10:55:43 yeah don't mind my stupidity before i wasn't thinking about it lol
general 2022-09-21 11:04:41 i've never seen a vib-ribbon fan before
general 2022-09-21 11:05:36 it's a good game
general 2022-09-21 11:05:42 rhythm game for the ps1
general 2022-09-21 11:05:51 yeah it's not an issue
general 2022-09-21 11:06:16 i literally don't know what's wrong with the image
general 2022-09-21 11:06:55 i know you have to go to registry editor
general 2022-09-21 11:07:05 and change a line that references app to browser
general 2022-09-21 11:07:43 
general 2022-09-21 11:07:44 here it is
general 2022-09-21 11:08:01 you're welcome
general 2022-09-21 11:13:33 i don't even play roblox anymore lol
general 2022-09-21 11:16:01 yeah idk if it works

general 2022-09-21 11:20:53 i gave up on pc2 a while ago
general 2022-09-21 11:28:49 you forgot the like
general 2022-09-21 11:32:16 van halen
general 2022-09-21 11:34:23 yes he is from back to the future and not a real person
general 2022-09-21 11:34:34 but he was featured in there
general 2022-09-21 11:40:20 yoshi tongue sound effect
general 2022-09-21 11:40:42 fun fact, the yoshi sound in super mario world is made from brass stabs
general 2022-09-21 11:42:13 https://youtu.be/Hu5IuRgFFNI
general 2022-09-21 12:32:23 hi spell
general 2022-09-21 12:40:15 i don't even play pc anymore, moved over to random shit
general 2022-09-21 12:42:21 i would never want to be a mod for this place
general 2022-09-21 12:45:39 flat out pings and dms
general 2022-09-21 12:46:28 lmao
general 2022-09-21 12:46:35 at least they're not 32x32
general 2022-09-21 15:00:27 there’s a hd screenshot as well
general 2022-09-21 15:08:52 hi darkz
general 2022-09-21 15:10:28 oh yeah it’s like 1am
general 2022-09-21 15:10:31 shit
general 2022-09-21 15:10:50 too hyped about the starfox orchestra hit being found
general 2022-09-21 15:11:36 yeah idk anything about omori except that it’s a game
general 2022-09-21 15:12:35 which song
general 2022-09-21 15:13:47 
general 2022-09-21 15:14:26 i can't believe i find this fucking thing before a full on guitar sample
general 2022-09-21 15:14:35 i am still searching for the alpha guitar
general 2022-09-21 15:15:41 need that sample for this
general 2022-09-21 15:15:46 as well as the other band samples
general 2022-09-21 15:15:57 since the alpha didn't have 2 instrument sets
general 2022-09-21 15:19:46 it's a shame that not every sample is currently found, i can only do some orchestra tracks with the only exception being the title theme
general 2022-09-21 15:19:56 the tension theme didn't work out too well
general 2022-09-21 15:20:05 as well as the sector z boss theme
general 2022-09-21 15:22:02 oh yeah i haven't sent that one before
general 2022-09-21 15:22:29 hi
general 2022-09-21 15:23:22 i really want to do the continue theme but the crystal sample is still unknown
general 2022-09-21 15:23:58 
general 2022-09-21 15:24:32 there's nothing like this theme in any other starfox game
general 2022-09-21 15:25:02 hajime's ost is really unique
general 2022-09-21 15:27:50 i honestly forgot i did this one lol
general 2022-09-21 15:28:03 i'm keeping track of these through my foobar playlist
general 2022-09-21 15:28:31 naming conventions are all over the place because i can't be bothered
general 2022-09-21 15:29:10 nah
general 2022-09-21 15:29:27 i don't take these "restores" seriously
general 2022-09-21 15:29:34 they're more like a proof of concept
general 2022-09-21 15:30:11 the people over at church of kondo do a proper job, i'm just sick of waiting over a year for 1 new starfox restore
general 2022-09-21 15:30:20 nice
general 2022-09-21 15:31:28 not glass but you get the idea
general 2022-09-21 15:31:37 flacs yeah?
general 2022-09-21 15:31:58 so they're in flac
general 2022-09-21 15:31:59 good
general 2022-09-21 15:32:46 i've been putting off the starfox 2 final spc rip for a long time
general 2022-09-21 15:32:54 it's just so repetitive
general 2022-09-21 15:34:01 i only get flacs if i can
general 2022-09-21 15:34:10 and export finished stuff in flac
general 2022-09-21 15:34:32 i just post demos and incomplete shit as mp3 to save space
general 2022-09-21 15:34:58 like the latest one i did was the space boss theme
general 2022-09-21 15:35:05 this is the starfox 2 final spc rip
general 2022-09-21 15:35:38 the build i am using is a hacked version of the post-final debug build of starfox 2
general 2022-09-21 15:35:54 reenables the sound test
general 2022-09-21 15:37:02 i have a demonstration tape that hasn't been preserved yet
general 2022-09-21 15:37:36 i really want to rip it but the tape deck i have isn't the best of the best
general 2022-09-21 15:38:12 damn
general 2022-09-21 15:39:38 alright bye
general 2022-09-21 15:39:44 might give the track a go
general 2022-09-22 12:08:18 idk but shaders are banned here
general 2022-09-22 12:24:05 it’s because yousuf is gone
general 2022-09-22 12:24:13 he warned people for shaders
general 2022-09-22 12:29:12 another false deadline from rick
general 2022-09-22 12:29:35 i want everything in lowercase but ipad says no
general 2022-09-22 12:36:13 him
general 2022-09-23 01:26:20 i hopped on splat3 because i thought splatfest started today

general 2022-09-23 10:15:55 like how i found the starfox orchestral hit
general 2022-09-23 10:17:14 i've got so much random shit in my romhacking folder
general 2022-09-23 10:17:40 blender 2.40 was for the 3dg1 imports
general 2022-09-23 10:17:57 then there's just a rom patcher tool
general 2022-09-23 10:22:32 alterna themes are completely different
general 2022-09-23 10:25:00 i didn't like that they decreased the tempo of this track in the final game so i bumped it up to be more like the trailer version
general 2022-09-23 10:25:41 they also reduced the amen break usage for some reason
general 2022-09-23 11:25:48 
general 2022-09-23 11:28:29 yep totally banned
general 2022-09-23 11:28:34 not just a name change

general 2022-09-24 14:02:59 https://tenor.com/view/cool-bad-to-the-bone-gif-20296695
general 2022-09-24 14:03:26 nothing will beat "my movie"
general 2022-09-24 14:03:31 best video
general 2022-09-24 14:03:36 ^
general 2022-09-24 14:06:22 i only took part in these splatfests
general 2022-09-24 14:06:46 as well as the christmas themed one
general 2022-09-24 14:07:06 nintendo online app is vertical only i can't change it
general 2022-09-24 14:07:09 yes it was
general 2022-09-24 14:07:18 get good
general 2022-09-24 14:07:22 quite literally
general 2022-09-24 14:08:55 shifty stations were the best part since they were different each splatfest
general 2022-09-24 14:09:11 there's nothing like that in splat3, they should bring them back
general 2022-09-24 14:10:26 oh yeah and i played in the world premiere, the ice cream one or something
general 2022-09-24 14:10:58 i don't really play roblox anymore so idk
general 2022-09-24 14:11:31 what
bot-central 2022-09-24 14:11:49 !rank

general 2022-09-24 14:21:17 actually?
general 2022-09-24 14:21:27 damn lol
general 2022-09-24 15:14:23 now that's a good bitrate
general 2022-09-24 15:16:05 the first band track "restored"
general 2022-09-24 15:16:37 it's just not the same without the crystal sample
general 2022-09-24 15:18:00 the orchestral tracks are done better but of course not proper
general 2022-09-24 15:18:07 church of kondo does the real shit
general 2022-09-24 15:18:11 nah i'm good
general 2022-09-24 15:18:20 this is more of a proof of concept
general 2022-09-24 15:19:03 yeah it's gone
general 2022-09-24 15:20:23 sector x was the best one by far
general 2022-09-24 15:20:25 or space armada
general 2022-09-24 15:21:35 it would be so good to fully "restore" the venom highway theme but i don't have all the samples
general 2022-09-24 15:23:26 yeah i've been away from spotify for like 2 years now
general 2022-09-24 15:26:28 i would never be a mod here
general 2022-09-24 15:26:38 i would get tons of dms and pings
general 2022-09-24 15:26:45 hate that shit
general 2022-09-24 16:17:56 hi koy
general 2022-09-25 01:57:43 ok
general 2022-09-25 01:57:59 hi
general 2022-09-25 02:06:16 no
general 2022-09-25 02:10:37 i’ve been queuing up for tricolour and haven’t got it not once
general 2022-09-25 03:22:10 the pug copy
general 2022-09-25 03:23:13 no and don’t bother
general 2022-09-25 03:23:19 they’re banned here
general 2022-09-25 07:33:59 of course
general 2022-09-25 07:58:14 no
general 2022-09-25 07:58:17 it's a shit game
general 2022-09-25 08:08:20 this one didn't turn out that bad
general 2022-09-25 08:08:38 the starfox tom sample is just something else
general 2022-09-25 08:08:50 and the orchestral hit in game is compressed to hell
general 2022-09-25 08:09:12 (this is the secret boss in out of this dimension)
general 2022-09-25 09:01:28 good idea to not use any of them
general 2022-09-25 09:08:39 do not say that morbius
general 2022-09-25 09:08:56 you will get cancelled and the sequel will never be made
general 2022-09-25 09:09:37 no he will get cancelled
general 2022-09-25 09:09:41 on twitter
general 2022-09-25 09:09:54 because that place is known for that
general 2022-09-25 09:10:03 good
general 2022-09-25 09:10:49 dr michael morbius
general 2022-09-25 09:12:34 it was the movie ever
general 2022-09-25 09:21:36 https://youtu.be/kMZesdJwLiM
general 2022-09-25 09:21:40 recap
general 2022-09-25 09:21:53 you don't need to ask for someone to share
general 2022-09-25 09:21:57 common sense
general 2022-09-25 09:30:02 i don't give a shit about pc2 anymore
general 2022-09-25 09:30:16 if it comes out then it's out
general 2022-09-25 09:30:17 no
general 2022-09-25 09:30:24 i would never be a mod here
general 2022-09-25 09:30:40 i would get tons of dms and pings
general 2022-09-25 09:30:42 hate that shit
general 2022-09-25 09:31:25 i'm focusing on my starfox stuff still
general 2022-09-25 09:32:02 the track is so empty without the rest of the samples
general 2022-09-25 09:32:28 the crystal sample and the various sy77 waveforms really make the track
general 2022-09-25 09:32:56 the bass and flute is shared with the tg55 so that's how i got them
general 2022-09-25 09:33:12 yeah
general 2022-09-25 09:33:14 forums
general 2022-09-25 09:40:02 this technically counts as an official remix of an original starfox song
general 2022-09-25 09:40:45 it's just that the original version wasn't heard for 28 years
general 2022-09-25 10:12:21 i only got a single tricolour battle lmao
general 2022-09-26 01:46:04 it’s possible
general 2022-09-26 01:47:13 i think most people here agree that you can make good looking builds that also function well
the-dump 2022-09-26 01:51:12 it is
general 2022-09-26 03:19:27 no
general 2022-09-26 03:24:49 what is this guy on about
general 2022-09-26 06:30:39 same
general 2022-09-26 06:33:54 he want mic up
general 2022-09-26 06:43:15 who would've thought that one of the samples here was a voice sample
general 2022-09-26 06:43:36 no
general 2022-09-26 06:44:19 no there's only 1 hof
general 2022-09-26 06:57:40 funny
general 2022-09-26 06:58:44 the fall
general 2022-09-26 07:00:17 anyway here's the updated version of the carrier interior restoration since we've had the voice sample for years and i never knew
general 2022-09-26 07:00:18 hi
general 2022-09-26 07:00:45 not sure
general 2022-09-26 07:00:52 when's the assignment due
general 2022-09-26 07:01:03 starfox 2 is where it's at
general 2022-09-26 07:01:14 shit lol
general 2022-09-26 07:01:28 maybe get sleep then do it tomorrow
general 2022-09-26 07:02:06 it's got 2 offical remixes of original starfox tracks
general 2022-09-26 07:02:09 used to have 3
general 2022-09-26 07:03:01 disaster
general 2022-09-26 07:03:38 stop spreading misinformation
general 2022-09-26 07:03:39 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/746750370264645632
general 2022-09-26 07:04:05 or are you saying the original creator deleted the build in his saves?
general 2022-09-26 07:04:18 ah
general 2022-09-26 07:05:26 we didn't hear the original for like 28 years but it still sort of counts
general 2022-09-26 07:06:51 oh hi seyo
general 2022-09-26 07:06:56 what happened to your ranks
general 2022-09-26 07:07:20 had to convert it
general 2022-09-26 07:10:32 this was the forbidden 3rd remix
general 2022-09-26 07:10:42 it kinda sucks so i see why they removed it
general 2022-09-26 07:11:05 the venom theme is a banger though can't deny it
general 2022-09-26 07:11:33 alright
general 2022-09-26 07:16:30 i hate spc2it
general 2022-09-26 07:16:46 always missing the first note of each channel
general 2022-09-26 07:16:57 have to manually repair it most of the time
general 2022-09-26 07:58:34 the opening drums are way better when not compressed
general 2022-09-26 07:59:55 there's just no drive without the hi hat though
general 2022-09-26 08:00:04 it really makes the track
general 2022-09-26 08:00:57 hipster said i would be a good mod but i would never want to be a mod here
general 2022-09-26 08:01:06 too many pings and dms for me
general 2022-09-26 08:01:58 there's a reason why i did this lol
general 2022-09-26 08:02:31 wow lol
general 2022-09-26 08:03:10 none but i've gotten a few dms from here before
general 2022-09-26 08:03:57 i mostly did it just in case
general 2022-09-26 08:08:11 i just realised i could do some stuff with eladard
general 2022-09-26 08:17:42 the bass is just something else
general 2022-09-26 08:18:48 
general 2022-09-26 08:19:10 it's how they got that sound
general 2022-09-26 08:20:41 deserved
general 2022-09-26 10:39:56 hi seed
general 2022-09-26 11:06:59 how the hell do i get rid of the roblox beta app
general 2022-09-26 11:08:53 i've tried
general 2022-09-26 11:08:58 it literally doesn't work
general 2022-09-26 11:16:54 yeah it's entirely forced for me
general 2022-09-26 11:17:47 roblox is getting even worse, forcing users to use their beta software
general 2022-09-26 11:18:35 yep
general 2022-09-26 11:18:43 can't get out of it
general 2022-09-26 11:18:54 it's a laggy piece of shit too
general 2022-09-26 11:19:09 it's the desktop beta one
general 2022-09-26 11:19:36 idk any other apps for roblox
general 2022-09-26 11:19:48 it's not the microsoft store one
general 2022-09-26 11:19:52 new launcher
general 2022-09-26 11:20:40 it doesn't really help when i always have a bunch of apps open so i can do other things
general 2022-09-26 11:20:54 it just makes the experience worse
general 2022-09-26 11:32:18 i had to go download a custom launcher
general 2022-09-26 11:32:24 this is how bad this is
general 2022-09-26 11:32:35 hipster what happened to your pfp
general 2022-09-26 11:32:55 and it works
general 2022-09-26 11:33:07 fair enough lol
general 2022-09-26 11:33:53 but the fact that i have to use custom software to get out of roblox's "beta" app is terrible
general 2022-09-26 13:00:29 ^
general 2022-09-26 13:00:34 not a fan
general 2022-09-26 13:01:02 hi olin
general 2022-09-26 13:51:20 good

general 2022-09-26 21:53:10 10th
general 2022-09-26 22:01:24 seyo was expert
general 2022-09-26 22:01:34 robo left the mod team
general 2022-09-27 08:41:04 hi
general 2022-09-27 12:11:37 hi rage
general 2022-09-27 12:12:07 i’m a bit hyped since the starfox crystal sample was found
general 2022-09-27 12:12:17 which means i can do even more
general 2022-09-27 12:12:44 hi
general 2022-09-27 12:14:51 it will all make sense
general 2022-09-27 12:15:00 the beginning sequence
general 2022-09-27 12:15:32 i've done a bit of the meteor theme but the crystal sample is important
general 2022-09-27 12:16:22 and it also means the stuff to find list is like this now
general 2022-09-27 12:16:31 idk why the guitar is still there
general 2022-09-27 12:16:41 it's confirmed to be d70
general 2022-09-27 14:03:22 lol
general 2022-09-27 14:03:44 i haven’t properly used spotify for months
general 2022-09-27 14:03:49 i think a year now
general 2022-09-27 20:45:22 lies and deception
general 2022-09-27 20:48:52 no
general 2022-09-28 00:20:04 true
general 2022-09-28 01:14:53 lmao
general 2022-09-28 01:16:56 it looks like a mini vehicle lol
general 2022-09-28 01:28:59 no
general 2022-09-28 01:29:51 i’m from 2020
general 2022-09-28 01:35:34 i need to get the crystal sample in
general 2022-09-28 01:37:03 like it's there in a way higher quality
general 2022-09-28 01:37:24 but the lack of dsp effects doesn't make it sound right
general 2022-09-28 01:48:04 i just realised i can do the out of this dimension theme
general 2022-09-28 01:48:16 an interesting track
general 2022-09-28 01:55:22 
general 2022-09-28 01:55:33 it's basically almost done
general 2022-09-28 01:56:57 all that needs to be found is the proper source of the snare and the scratch noise at the start
general 2022-09-28 01:57:26 no you need the original source
general 2022-09-28 01:57:32 that's the whole point
general 2022-09-28 01:57:44 like the original sample source
general 2022-09-28 01:57:57 from whatever library or piece of hardware it used
general 2022-09-28 01:58:23 you just said find a snare lol
general 2022-09-28 01:58:29 can't use any snare
general 2022-09-28 01:58:57 won't sound right if i use the hyperduel snare or the power drift snare
general 2022-09-28 02:08:58 guitar and crystal is from the roland d70, kick is from uos2, bass and toms are from the tg77, snare was ripped from a ds game, rest is from lcd1
general 2022-09-28 11:00:18 never thought i'd hear this
general 2022-09-28 11:52:22 well it's a release window
general 2022-09-28 11:52:43 a date is a specific day
general 2022-09-28 11:52:53 this is the release window
general 2022-09-28 11:53:01 he still missed the release window
general 2022-09-28 11:55:04 also planned isn't confirmed
general 2022-09-28 11:55:13 that's just what he was aiming for
general 2022-09-28 11:55:26 but obviously didn't go ahead
general 2022-09-28 11:55:31 lmao
general 2022-09-28 11:58:09 fuck there was a tuning issue with everything i did with the "band" instrument set
general 2022-09-28 11:58:21 guess i have to edit all of them
general 2022-09-28 12:27:18 seed
general 2022-09-28 12:33:09 aquatic ambience
general 2022-09-28 13:32:37 that one bowser theme park world in super mario 3d world
general 2022-09-28 13:33:58 it's the world bowser theme
general 2022-09-28 13:56:31 fair
general 2022-09-29 05:51:03 which part
general 2022-09-29 05:51:12 battles in general or the story mode
general 2022-09-29 05:51:20 or salmon run
general 2022-09-29 05:51:26 fair enough
general 2022-09-29 05:51:40 because yeah
general 2022-09-29 05:51:46 also don't spoil it for others
general 2022-09-29 05:51:56 hasn't even been a month since the game came out
general 2022-09-29 05:52:36 i do have to say the entire final sequence is insane
general 2022-09-29 05:52:43 not saying much more
general 2022-09-29 05:53:51 you start in the crater and go to alterna
general 2022-09-29 05:54:06 not really spoiling anything since you can see it in official footage
general 2022-09-29 05:54:40 i do miss the turquoise october tracks
general 2022-09-29 05:55:02 but not as difficult
general 2022-09-29 05:55:30 tentacular and girl from inkopolis were great
general 2022-09-29 05:55:54 dedf1sh's tracks from octo were good as well
general 2022-09-29 05:57:10 have you completed the secret stage
general 2022-09-29 05:57:41 splat3
general 2022-09-29 05:58:34 unrelated but i don't remember if screenshots were blocked for the splatoon 2 testfire
general 2022-09-29 05:58:41 not the splatfest world premiere
general 2022-09-29 05:58:59 i would've had a couple but i have none
general 2022-09-29 06:05:44 it's not hard to fully complete the hero mode in splatoon 3
general 2022-09-29 06:06:00 whereas you had to beat every stage with every weapon in splatoon 2
general 2022-09-29 06:06:15 too bad
general 2022-09-29 06:07:47 i’m only at 577%
general 2022-09-29 06:07:53 max is 1000%
general 2022-09-29 06:59:33 pug i scanned in my splatoon 2 squid amiibo in splatoon 3 and instantly got the power armour set day 1 lol
general 2022-09-29 07:00:15 really funny slight advantage
general 2022-09-29 07:01:57 i just enjoy the game for what it is
general 2022-09-29 07:02:15 it’s different
general 2022-09-29 07:02:25 never
general 2022-09-29 07:02:36 i hate their decisions lmao
general 2022-09-29 07:02:43 can’t even make decent online
general 2022-09-29 07:02:47 hi
general 2022-09-29 08:21:57 wow you’re alive
general 2022-09-29 13:35:49 no clue what that is
general 2022-09-29 13:36:28 i think it has something to do with octopus
general 2022-09-29 13:37:39 ok
general 2022-09-29 13:41:37 fun fact: the only instrument in the briefing jingle from starfox 1 is the low string sample
general 2022-09-29 13:41:48 the rest of the jingle is comprised of sound effects
general 2022-09-29 13:42:23 
general 2022-09-29 13:44:39 no
general 2022-09-29 13:44:46 boxness server is shit
general 2022-09-29 13:44:56 i was there before
general 2022-09-29 13:44:59 didn't really like it
general 2022-09-29 13:45:09 i refuse to believe that
general 2022-09-29 13:45:18 it wasn't good before the raid either
general 2022-09-29 13:45:41 hard to explain
general 2022-09-29 13:46:02 just a bad atmosphere in general, worse than here
general 2022-09-29 13:46:33 i didn't get screenshots from boxness server
general 2022-09-29 13:46:41 i mean if you have a few then go ahead
general 2022-09-29 13:47:12 like i genuinely find that boxness server is worse than here
general 2022-09-29 13:47:39 the game of all time
general 2022-09-29 13:48:25 i honestly didn't realise i was affected in the raid until someone sent a video of the ban log lmao
general 2022-09-29 13:49:12 i don't plan on joining boxness server again
general 2022-09-29 13:51:07 i mean nev and nexity were there and we talked sometimes but that's the only good part
general 2022-09-29 13:51:33 fix your server
general 2022-09-29 13:51:42 apparently it hasn't gotten any better
general 2022-09-29 13:51:45 since the raid
general 2022-09-29 13:53:06 hipster
general 2022-09-29 13:53:22 you can scroll up and read
general 2022-09-29 13:53:36 like it's the exact same issues
general 2022-09-29 13:53:57 no i'm talking to boxness
general 2022-09-29 13:54:14 because he can't see issues with his server
general 2022-09-29 13:58:36 he's just like that
general 2022-09-29 14:14:57 i'm seeing this shit lol
general 2022-09-29 14:16:29 
general 2022-09-29 14:16:39 still can't believe the crystal sample was found
general 2022-09-29 14:25:19 there's only 1 sample left in the ending theme and it's the one i don't have access to
general 2022-09-29 14:40:58 it's the place ever
general 2022-09-29 14:41:12 there's a reason why i don't really talk there
general 2022-09-29 14:41:17 or look at that place often
general 2022-09-29 14:47:07 there's a new one?
general 2022-09-29 14:47:13 didn't know
general 2022-09-29 14:48:16 very good integration
general 2022-09-29 14:57:18 same server
general 2022-09-29 14:57:35 but everyone that got affected by the raid got unbanned
general 2022-09-29 14:58:29 cooking the build
general 2022-09-29 15:03:31 why
general 2022-09-29 15:03:37 what's bad about it
general 2022-09-29 15:03:52 no i've seen it but idk what's bad about it
general 2022-09-29 15:04:11 i know it's a furry
general 2022-09-30 01:52:37 boxness server isn’t the best
general 2022-09-30 02:07:56 2005 is next year
general 2022-09-30 02:08:03 what are you on about
general 2022-09-30 06:47:08 tank
general 2022-09-30 06:53:41 that explains it
general 2022-09-30 07:17:57 salmon run teammates playing like low ranks despite being in eggsecutive rank
general 2022-09-30 07:18:54 we can’t read that
general 2022-09-30 07:19:11 not everybody here is indonesian
general 2022-09-30 14:10:39 actually is
general 2022-09-30 14:11:42 no?
general 2022-09-30 14:14:32 high stakes
general 2022-09-30 14:27:25 he's actually not wrong though
general 2022-09-30 14:28:00 it probably will get delayed
general 2022-09-30 14:28:10 where's the source of that info btw
general 2022-09-30 14:28:27 don't trust him
general 2022-09-30 14:31:20 it's because youtubers build up hype
general 2022-09-30 14:31:29 and increase awareness
general 2022-09-30 14:32:36 wait people actually have that mindset?
general 2022-09-30 14:32:38 lmao
general 2022-09-30 14:36:26 that's called the rank request process
general 2022-09-30 14:54:03 what daw do you use
general 2022-09-30 14:55:05 ah fl
general 2022-09-30 14:56:14 trackers such as openmpt are really different to daws
general 2022-09-30 14:56:21 like almost entirely different
general 2022-09-30 14:57:33 there’s a protracker clone for windows and it’s surprisingly accurate to the real deal
general 2022-09-30 15:06:36 what
general 2022-10-01 05:00:23 can't believe this
general 2022-10-01 05:01:35 no clue
general 2022-10-01 05:01:41 i've never heard of it
general 2022-10-01 05:08:43 hi hipster
general 2022-10-01 05:10:44 pc2 leak lmao
general 2022-10-01 05:10:55 honestly wouldn't mind a leak
general 2022-10-01 05:11:10 would be a good indication of progress
general 2022-10-01 06:06:25 wrong order so it's not that flag
general 2022-10-01 06:06:55 fair enough
general 2022-10-01 06:08:58 you roll them if you're an eshay
general 2022-10-01 06:14:48 yeah that's actually the wrong spelling lol
general 2022-10-01 06:15:17 nah it's colour
general 2022-10-01 06:15:48 fair enough
general 2022-10-01 06:18:49 can't believe it
general 2022-10-01 12:54:15 hi battleship
general 2022-10-01 13:14:45 damn, what happened?
general 2022-10-01 13:16:42 oh
general 2022-10-01 15:22:08 oh no
general 2022-10-01 15:22:15 not pay to win simulator
general 2022-10-01 15:22:28 get the cure
general 2022-10-01 15:22:49 that's why i said to get it
general 2022-10-02 00:49:22 that stupid beta app is even worse than the logo
general 2022-10-02 00:50:26 i had to use a tool to get rid of it
general 2022-10-02 00:51:01 idk if i can post the git link to it but it also lets you add back the old death sound
general 2022-10-02 00:51:19 yeah i know it’s easy
general 2022-10-02 00:51:32 but this program does it automatically
general 2022-10-02 00:51:55 to get rid of the shitty desktop app
general 2022-10-02 00:52:06 the death sound is just an extra
general 2022-10-02 00:53:55 damn
general 2022-10-02 00:54:56 welcome to roblox building
general 2022-10-02 00:55:02 official roblox game
general 2022-10-02 00:55:33 it’s the game ever
general 2022-10-02 00:55:43 every server had a couple exploiters
general 2022-10-02 00:55:56 with custom audio and decals
general 2022-10-02 01:00:32 base wars was fun
general 2022-10-02 01:00:42 even though i wasn’t good at it
general 2022-10-02 05:07:16 it's forced
general 2022-10-02 05:07:40 no it actually is
general 2022-10-02 05:07:49 i couldn't opt out of it
general 2022-10-02 05:08:57 they took the option out of the menu
general 2022-10-02 05:09:19 settings
general 2022-10-02 05:09:31 in the app there used to be a button to opt out
general 2022-10-02 05:10:31 and now they made it so it changes "inbrowser" to "inapp" in their registry
general 2022-10-02 05:10:51 even if you change it back to inbrowser it goes back to inapp
general 2022-10-02 05:10:57 https://github.com/lolmanurfunny/Roblox-Launcher-minus-the-app
general 2022-10-02 05:11:08 just use this if you want to escape the desktop app
general 2022-10-02 05:11:50 duke nukem
general 2022-10-02 05:13:27 koy use that launcher on github
general 2022-10-02 05:13:41 it just bypasses the desktop app
general 2022-10-02 05:13:54 the roblox website?
general 2022-10-02 05:14:14 damn
general 2022-10-02 05:14:38 it's terrible for my performance
general 2022-10-02 05:14:43 the app is bloated
general 2022-10-02 05:15:46 it was a single incident
general 2022-10-02 05:16:23 what happened
general 2022-10-02 05:16:41 
general 2022-10-02 05:21:58 i really want to get that starfox 2 orchestra set bass
general 2022-10-02 05:22:30 starfox 2 retains most of hajime's set but had a few differences in the early builds
general 2022-10-02 05:22:36 i would never apply
general 2022-10-02 05:24:01 there was a different snare for orchestra levels, a different string sample, different trumpet, voice sample (from the korg m1), and the bass sample
general 2022-10-02 05:24:17 only 2 of those samples stayed in the final game
general 2022-10-02 12:19:22 time traveller
general 2022-10-02 12:23:36 #1 blade runner 2049 supporter
general 2022-10-02 12:23:50 tbh i heard that the movie was actually decent
general 2022-10-02 12:26:03 love and thunder was a disaster
general 2022-10-02 12:26:08 it's so shit
general 2022-10-02 12:26:13 i watched it
general 2022-10-02 12:26:37 most of the jokes don't land as well
general 2022-10-02 12:27:41 need those dole branded bananas from super monkey ball
general 2022-10-02 13:13:37 dunce can you be serious for once
general 2022-10-02 13:13:40 please
general 2022-10-02 13:14:05 hi
general 2022-10-02 13:14:09 not feeling good atm
general 2022-10-02 13:14:24 because we care about hipster
general 2022-10-02 13:14:43 no read above
general 2022-10-02 13:15:46 yeah i can't do shit
general 2022-10-02 13:17:30 he is
general 2022-10-04 05:33:39 it didn't happen recently
general 2022-10-04 05:34:02 it was something to experience
general 2022-10-04 05:34:11 russia
general 2022-10-04 08:01:12 what audio is it
general 2022-10-04 08:01:37 never heard of it
general 2022-10-04 08:02:35 yeah roblox is shit
general 2022-10-04 08:04:31 they really need to step up when it comes to issues like that
general 2022-10-04 08:04:47 like badly
general 2022-10-04 08:08:41 unrelated but i really hope gep on foobar gets an update to properly support dual multipcm setups in the control window
general 2022-10-04 08:08:55 i want to properly isolate channels in the virtua racing ost
general 2022-10-04 08:09:32 the 2nd chip doesn't fully fit in the window
general 2022-10-04 08:09:44 only channels 0 and 1 of mpcm2 are visible
general 2022-10-04 08:10:08 really want to do a proper job of getting the unheard parts audible
general 2022-10-04 08:11:07 like getting every channel isolated, export to wav, get it all "mixed" and shit
general 2022-10-04 08:18:03 if i could do it with the raw sequence data i really would
general 2022-10-04 08:20:49 1 thing i really want to do with raw data is replace samples in arcade games
general 2022-10-04 08:21:24 only problem is idk how audacity can export raw data
general 2022-10-04 08:21:31 might need something else
general 2022-10-04 08:22:24 hi koy
general 2022-10-04 08:25:26 having them at a higher quality would be even better but there's nothing like msu1 for the segapcm or whatever other sound chips used for super scaler boards
general 2022-10-04 08:25:59 there's just so much going on in the pcm channels and i love it
general 2022-10-04 08:26:18 i'm alright
general 2022-10-04 08:26:28 starting to get back
general 2022-10-04 08:26:55 already coming up with dumbass ideas lmao
general 2022-10-04 08:28:10 another problem has to do with the guitar samples, hiro sampled live guitars for use in many super scaler games including after burner 2 and power drift, he's lost the original recordings though
general 2022-10-04 08:28:37 i already found a few of the other samples and they mostly came from roland stuff
general 2022-10-04 08:35:13 hi hipster
general 2022-10-04 08:37:39 people still play overwatch?
general 2022-10-04 08:38:15 i've never touched overwatch
general 2022-10-04 08:41:50 i really like vgm since i have so much freedom on what i want to hear but multipcm games are a way different story
general 2022-10-04 08:41:57 there's a bunch of channel swapping
general 2022-10-04 08:42:29 except for virtua racing, that has the cleanest channel layout out of every game that uses the multipcm chip
general 2022-10-04 08:43:37 it's the first sound chip channel from the main theme of wingwar
general 2022-10-04 08:44:15 virtua racing was the first game developed with the multipcm chip so it makes sense why it has such a clean channel layout
general 2022-10-04 08:45:04 outrunners and other multipcm games that came after were just a mess with the channel layout
general 2022-10-04 08:45:20 there's probably one before outrunners but i forgot it
general 2022-10-04 08:46:22 yeah wingwar's ost is good depite not being handled by hiro or mitsuyoshi
general 2022-10-04 08:46:42 they're legendary sega composers
general 2022-10-04 08:47:12 like hiro's been around since the development of hang-on in 1985
general 2022-10-04 08:48:13 mitsuyoshi is more known for this
general 2022-10-04 08:48:56 he composed many games before such as gp rider, g-loc, and strike fighter
general 2022-10-04 08:49:01 can't think of any more atm
general 2022-10-04 08:49:59 yeah definitely better
general 2022-10-04 08:51:07 how the fuck did i forget virtua racing
general 2022-10-04 08:51:19 i just mentioned it before
general 2022-10-04 08:52:10 i don't get it i know basically next to nothing about planes lol
general 2022-10-04 08:52:54 oh
general 2022-10-04 08:53:39 no i really didn't notice lol
general 2022-10-04 08:54:56 ok i definitely see it now
general 2022-10-04 08:57:02 how
general 2022-10-04 08:59:13 one time my entire taskbar didn't load properly at all
general 2022-10-04 08:59:42 pupper's in hipster's server
general 2022-10-04 08:59:50 yeah
general 2022-10-04 09:00:28 nobody will know what's wrong except me and someone else here
general 2022-10-04 09:00:48 you have to know the game pilotwings to see it
general 2022-10-04 09:01:39 can't believe it
general 2022-10-04 09:02:24 2
general 2022-10-04 09:02:31 what's it for
general 2022-10-04 09:02:50 fair enough
general 2022-10-04 09:03:37 the biggest mystery
general 2022-10-04 09:04:16 absolute disaster
general 2022-10-04 09:04:40 now i talk about random bs nobody cares about
general 2022-10-04 09:04:53 like how turbo outrun has impressive segapcm usage for an early super scaler
general 2022-10-04 09:06:48 it's similar to the megadrive's sound capabilities but way more impressive
general 2022-10-04 09:06:56 best of fm and samples
general 2022-10-04 09:07:27 instead of a single pcm channel you have 16
general 2022-10-04 09:08:15 i don't understand japanese so i have no clue
general 2022-10-04 09:10:17 the fm chip is usually reserved for the lead, chords, bass, and anything else other than drums
general 2022-10-04 09:11:21 the pcm however does all this, this is really impressive for 1988
general 2022-10-04 09:13:37 well i know i'm definitely not going to be mod since i didn't apply
general 2022-10-04 09:15:11 i once stayed up until 4am dealing with 16x16 backgrounds for starfox
general 2022-10-04 09:15:20 i still hate the 4bpp graphics limit
general 2022-10-04 09:15:41 bits per pixel
general 2022-10-04 09:15:47 16 colours basically
general 2022-10-04 09:16:11 well you can choose from a maximum of 8 lines
general 2022-10-04 09:16:27 in starfox 1 you only get like 6 though
general 2022-10-04 09:16:46 starfox 2 is even worse when it comes to this, maximum of 3 per level palette
general 2022-10-04 09:18:26 this was the one i was trying to port btw
general 2022-10-04 09:18:55 stunt race fx is even worse with level palettes btw
general 2022-10-04 09:19:01 there's only 2 lines
general 2022-10-04 09:19:34 but they got around this with directly putting coloured strips on the screen
general 2022-10-04 09:23:39 i definitely got better at working with the limit though
general 2022-10-04 09:23:55 sf2 fortuna had a lot of useless graphics in it
general 2022-10-04 09:27:55 hi rage
general 2022-10-04 09:29:14 2004 is now
general 2022-10-04 10:39:21 fuck
general 2022-10-04 10:39:46 i accidentally bought 2 useless skateboard decorations in splat 3
general 2022-10-04 10:40:02 they were like 19,000 each lmao
general 2022-10-04 10:44:19 good idea
general 2022-10-04 10:55:45 shit
general 2022-10-04 10:55:49 that's terrible
general 2022-10-04 11:14:43 discord glitch
general 2022-10-04 11:14:46 appears fine for us
general 2022-10-04 11:15:01 you like highlight it
general 2022-10-04 11:15:11 yeah it's happened before
general 2022-10-04 11:15:24 you're welcome
general 2022-10-04 11:17:19 idk it just sometimes happens
general 2022-10-04 11:17:24 maybe restart discord
general 2022-10-04 11:17:49 oh lol
general 2022-10-04 11:25:36 yeah really is
general 2022-10-04 11:27:48 yeah not a great idea
general 2022-10-04 11:34:30 to be honest i am terrible at responding to stuff like this but i hope you'll get better
general 2022-10-04 11:35:59 it's been a sad couple of days for me but i won't talk about it
general 2022-10-04 11:38:01 i've already vented about it in dms and i'm getting better at least
general 2022-10-04 11:38:42 maybe don't vent to me since i'm really not good at responding
general 2022-10-04 11:39:38 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1026819973907238994
general 2022-10-04 11:39:52 i said i wouldn't talk about it
general 2022-10-04 11:40:09 exactly
general 2022-10-04 11:57:25 yeah maybe i should go too
general 2022-10-04 11:58:07 yeah
general 2022-10-04 11:59:31 aquatic ambience is good but nothing can beat corneria
general 2022-10-04 12:00:15 starfox honestly has a way better instrument set than super mario kart
general 2022-10-04 12:00:19 i love it
general 2022-10-04 12:00:45 it's so good that they used the same instrument set in the next game
general 2022-10-04 12:01:40 i'm actually listening to the "restored" version i did but only with the drums and the bass
general 2022-10-04 12:01:49 i could send it here if you want
general 2022-10-04 12:02:28 it's for a good reason
general 2022-10-04 12:02:41 
general 2022-10-04 12:03:15 that yamaha bass
general 2022-10-04 12:03:17 tg77
general 2022-10-04 12:03:39 the tom is also from the tg77
general 2022-10-04 12:03:58 kick is from uos volume 2
general 2022-10-04 12:04:16 snare was ripped from a ds game since the current source still isn't known
general 2022-10-04 12:05:51 gn hipster
general 2022-10-04 12:07:06 i'm still probably going to talk about random bs
general 2022-10-04 12:08:04 like how the boss roll theme from starfox 1 is just so good
general 2022-10-04 12:08:35 the original starfox just has such a unique feel to it
general 2022-10-04 12:08:50 overall aesthetic and music
general 2022-10-04 12:09:23 starfox 2 is really good but it feels more like 64
general 2022-10-04 12:10:22 more of that orchestral type stuff
general 2022-10-05 00:18:57 the plane ever
general 2022-10-05 00:19:49 morfix don't ask about the numbers
general 2022-10-05 00:19:52 they're a mystery
general 2022-10-05 00:21:03 shame
general 2022-10-05 00:21:08 oh yeah hi koy
general 2022-10-05 00:21:36 i'm getting better
general 2022-10-05 00:21:55 how about you
general 2022-10-05 00:24:43 tree
general 2022-10-05 00:28:42 wait actually
general 2022-10-05 04:28:00 light box
general 2022-10-05 04:30:42 i instantly saved like 40gb by deleting zip files
general 2022-10-05 04:31:04 yamaha samples took up like 6gb lol
general 2022-10-05 08:12:57 high tech
general 2022-10-05 08:31:53 trying out vgmtrans again
general 2022-10-05 08:32:11 file output needs a lot of work to get it sounding decent
general 2022-10-05 08:44:41 actually nvm it's really bad lmao
general 2022-10-05 08:44:58 the opening part of the starfox 2 demo theme runs way too fast
general 2022-10-05 08:45:20 there's a bunch of tuning issues as well
general 2022-10-05 08:58:01 there was a literal race war in splatoon 2
general 2022-10-05 11:00:56 hi hipster
general 2022-10-05 11:09:33 how are you
general 2022-10-05 11:10:18 i'm better than how i was this morning
general 2022-10-05 11:12:22 apparently i didn't save the stuff i did with the meteor theme
general 2022-10-05 11:17:15 i found a backup and just went from there
general 2022-10-05 11:17:30 had to fix the tuning of the tom and the crystal
general 2022-10-05 11:18:53 i wish i had those
general 2022-10-05 11:19:21 as long as they're wired then they're good for me
general 2022-10-05 11:19:38 i've got a bunch of older gear
general 2022-10-05 11:19:54 3.5mm jack yeah?
general 2022-10-05 11:20:01 alright sick
general 2022-10-05 11:20:08 i'll look into it then
general 2022-10-05 11:28:09 waiting for the tcrf page for ex-zodiac
general 2022-10-05 11:28:17 there's a lot of unused stuff
general 2022-10-05 11:28:36 i would make it myself but i hate writing on tcrf so i won't
general 2022-10-05 11:30:00 it's just a game
general 2022-10-05 11:30:15 think of the original starfox but like running on way better hardware
general 2022-10-05 11:44:56 (it has an incredible soundtrack and i just love the game in general)
general 2022-10-05 11:46:22 the euclides belt theme is just something else
general 2022-10-05 11:49:50 https://youtu.be/D7iSy0Jsi6g <@740790456182636595> idk if you'll like it but i love it
general 2022-10-05 11:50:14 i got the entire soundtrack in flac
general 2022-10-05 11:58:22 stage 6's theme is also really good
general 2022-10-05 12:01:46 https://youtu.be/2wNNP3UZjjs
general 2022-10-05 12:07:54 i'm surprised you like them since they're just so different
general 2022-10-05 12:09:19 yeah i'm a bit more picky
general 2022-10-05 12:11:41 it's got that really nice fm bass
general 2022-10-05 12:25:12 hi 99er
general 2022-10-05 12:26:34 roblox vc was a mistake
general 2022-10-05 12:32:03 not necessarily a mistake, the original vision was just twisted into what we have today
general 2022-10-05 12:32:21 which isn't great
general 2022-10-05 12:34:57 they put their resources into a big bloated menu which is slower than using the website but still can't make a 64bit version of the base launcher
general 2022-10-05 12:43:10 i fall into the trap of documenting information on discord rather than tcrf
general 2022-10-05 12:43:36 it's only because i don't like writing on tcrf
general 2022-10-05 12:45:09 like it's a great site for this stuff but there's just too much pressure for me to write something good
general 2022-10-05 12:45:19 instead of just causally explaining it on here
general 2022-10-05 12:50:26 like round andross isn't on tcrf
general 2022-10-05 13:10:17 i'm probably going to go too
general 2022-10-05 13:10:46 i do not know why they did this to the spreadsheet
general 2022-10-05 13:11:07 yeah it sort of matches the japanese logo colour scheme
general 2022-10-05 13:11:17 but it just looks wrong
general 2022-10-05 13:12:24 it might be because i'm used to the revision 1 title
general 2022-10-05 13:13:47 now i really don't get why these colours were chosen for pilotwings
general 2022-10-05 13:14:10 nothing on the title screen has these colours
general 2022-10-05 20:45:19 it’s true
general 2022-10-06 01:15:52 hi koy
general 2022-10-06 01:16:26 i'm fine
general 2022-10-06 01:16:36 not the best but still alright
general 2022-10-06 01:23:27 i didn't bother with apps
general 2022-10-06 01:24:22 i just don't want to be one
general 2022-10-06 01:36:46 this server has gotten terrible
general 2022-10-06 01:36:53 never used to be like this
general 2022-10-06 01:37:47 wait when did bog join back
general 2022-10-06 01:41:21 hi
general 2022-10-06 02:00:12 just push the big red button
general 2022-10-06 02:00:15 it's the go button
general 2022-10-06 02:13:53 the food ever
general 2022-10-06 03:46:28 looking forward to it
general 2022-10-06 07:28:43 hi hipster
general 2022-10-06 07:29:31 hate audacity errors
general 2022-10-06 07:29:48 i just want to look at every channel
general 2022-10-06 07:30:16 windows experience
general 2022-10-06 07:31:18 i have 40 gigs of storage on the external drive
general 2022-10-06 07:31:19 how
general 2022-10-06 07:32:08 it switched back to the c drive
general 2022-10-06 07:32:11 wtf
general 2022-10-06 07:32:48 i did
general 2022-10-06 07:32:53 but it switched back
general 2022-10-06 07:32:57 for some reason
general 2022-10-06 07:37:15 i hate obs but i have to use it to record good looking stuff
general 2022-10-06 07:37:53 because snes9x recorder produces this mess
general 2022-10-06 07:38:33 it is what it is
general 2022-10-06 07:39:03 i think this is like the first time i sent this
general 2022-10-06 07:39:48 no idea
general 2022-10-06 07:40:10 i don't know japanese
general 2022-10-06 07:40:23 yeah
general 2022-10-06 07:40:46 i tried to use the snes9x recorder to show a palette cycle but you can't even see it
general 2022-10-06 07:40:51 it was so useful
general 2022-10-06 07:41:28 it depends on the area
general 2022-10-06 07:42:11 i ended up just using a screenshot of the palette and it was way more useful
general 2022-10-06 07:52:10 bad area
general 2022-10-06 07:52:54 good
general 2022-10-06 08:02:26 wow new pfp
general 2022-10-06 08:02:40 it's that really important information
general 2022-10-06 08:03:47 but why
general 2022-10-06 08:03:59 what's the point of taking the wheels off
general 2022-10-06 08:12:41 very funny
general 2022-10-06 08:12:54 people dump stuff
general 2022-10-06 08:14:55 super mario kart has a beta section but not starfox
general 2022-10-06 08:14:56 why
general 2022-10-06 08:15:11 i mean there's only 2 samples but it's something
general 2022-10-06 08:15:31 i would get the spreadsheet editor role but i'm too scared that i'll fuck the spreadsheet up
general 2022-10-06 08:17:04 they're only the drums so they're not that interesting
general 2022-10-06 08:17:41 like the first thing i found
general 2022-10-06 08:17:52 didn't do a great job tuning them
general 2022-10-06 08:24:05 decided to go fix this up a bit
general 2022-10-06 08:24:20 didn't realise the flute instrument from the slot machine theme was here
general 2022-10-06 08:24:27 nah
general 2022-10-06 08:24:31 i can't
general 2022-10-06 08:24:40 terrible at it
general 2022-10-06 08:24:59 no this is literally an spc2it job
general 2022-10-06 08:25:11 just the original sequence data converted to .it
general 2022-10-06 08:25:18 no
general 2022-10-06 08:25:24 i can't make any music
general 2022-10-06 08:25:37 i have tried
general 2022-10-06 08:26:45 i'm only alright at finding stuff
general 2022-10-06 08:34:09 i'm terrible at making original stuff, just not really for me
general 2022-10-06 08:34:34 i have the same amount lol
general 2022-10-06 08:35:13 like if i really wanted to do it i would go with a tracker but there's a steep learning curve with using them
general 2022-10-06 08:36:29 i've never been into anime
general 2022-10-06 08:39:54 wow
general 2022-10-06 08:51:05 what's that?
general 2022-10-06 08:52:46 i don't really branch out that much
general 2022-10-06 08:53:34 like i just listen to certain stuff and don't touch other stuff
general 2022-10-06 08:55:50 i didn't really play it lol
general 2022-10-06 08:56:02 yeah
general 2022-10-06 08:58:54 i've had it a few times before
general 2022-10-06 09:00:53 i'm so picky when it comes to music
general 2022-10-06 09:00:58 i don't like most stuff
general 2022-10-06 09:03:15 i just remembered i became broke in splatoon 3 from buying 2 skateboards and a sticker
general 2022-10-06 09:03:24 the sticker was 100,000
general 2022-10-06 09:09:56 there comes a point in salmon run where you have to say more than “this way” and “booyah”
general 2022-10-06 09:10:11 the glowflies event is so shit
general 2022-10-06 09:26:50 nah some are good
general 2022-10-06 09:38:37 i get so stressed when playing splatoon i just can’t
general 2022-10-06 09:38:58 yes
general 2022-10-06 09:39:03 this is the causal mode too
general 2022-10-06 09:39:06 not ranked
general 2022-10-06 09:42:58 it actually is
general 2022-10-06 09:43:10 there’s no aim assist
general 2022-10-06 09:43:33 so you have to learn motion controls to hit precision shots
general 2022-10-06 09:43:59 what
general 2022-10-06 09:45:32 idk i’m boring i can’t give you anything

general 2022-10-07 06:10:00 called exploits
general 2022-10-07 10:39:02 racial slur

general 2022-10-08 00:54:25 i need something like the spc700 window in foobar but it's for multipcm and segapcm
general 2022-10-08 00:54:42 just 24 channels displayed all at once
general 2022-10-08 02:03:27 jet
general 2022-10-08 03:10:53 smartest jet design
general 2022-10-08 03:18:27 what happened
general 2022-10-08 03:19:03 i go to another server and i come back and there's something happening
general 2022-10-08 03:21:07 that's the downside
general 2022-10-08 03:23:19 vip1 is the place ever
general 2022-10-08 03:24:33 i've been doing that for ages
general 2022-10-08 04:00:39 the fucking lag
general 2022-10-08 04:01:39 it really doesn't help that i have like tons of tabs open
general 2022-10-08 04:03:20 i've got like 500 ping lol
general 2022-10-08 04:32:58 it was an experience
general 2022-10-08 04:33:16 i was just flying around the map the entire time
general 2022-10-08 04:36:59 fonkl and hyper already chose but they're waiting for obc
general 2022-10-08 04:57:59 no
general 2022-10-08 05:37:58 so glad i was able to get rid of the roblox app
general 2022-10-08 07:03:52 i had no idea deflemask had segapcm support
general 2022-10-08 07:03:59 this changes everything
general 2022-10-08 07:06:35 fuck yeah
general 2022-10-08 07:06:52 i can basically import anything under 64kb
general 2022-10-08 07:10:40 shit there's only 5 pcm channels
general 2022-10-08 07:10:41 scam
general 2022-10-08 07:10:50 i wanted 16
general 2022-10-08 07:14:44 all 5 segapcm channels available
general 2022-10-08 07:15:13 it's so weird hearing starfox samples with this quality
general 2022-10-08 07:21:40 it just looks off with the shaders
general 2022-10-08 07:21:50 not right
general 2022-10-08 07:30:32 hi rage
general 2022-10-08 07:31:21 not a fan of shaders personally
general 2022-10-08 07:31:38 yousuf used to enforce that
general 2022-10-08 07:33:44 midway just produced an entire board for a single game
general 2022-10-08 07:33:51 nothing like that will happen again
general 2022-10-08 07:34:24 it was to support the targa graphics stuff
general 2022-10-08 07:35:19 they're not in the targa format but it's theoretically possible to rebuild graphics binaries if you get the necessary stuff
general 2022-10-08 07:36:19 become terrible
general 2022-10-08 07:36:23 over time
general 2022-10-08 07:37:03 i barely play roblox anymore
general 2022-10-08 07:38:00 same
general 2022-10-08 07:38:16 there's a fork of the narc source code on github which can be built from source
general 2022-10-08 07:38:49 honestly i don't know
general 2022-10-08 07:38:53 i just know it does the thing
general 2022-10-08 07:39:03 no
general 2022-10-08 07:39:10 it's a very funny drug dealer game
general 2022-10-08 07:39:47 where it was considered to be extremely violent when it came out
general 2022-10-08 07:40:08 uses the same digitisation techniques as the original mortal kombat
general 2022-10-08 07:41:58 it builds the program roms for the game narc and fixes them up so they can be launched from mame
general 2022-10-08 07:42:25 since mame checks for checksums (which can be very annoying but necessary)
general 2022-10-08 07:42:33 good
general 2022-10-08 07:46:23 ^
general 2022-10-08 07:46:43 shaders just look wrong imo
general 2022-10-08 07:56:53 hi hipster
general 2022-10-08 07:57:46 how are you
general 2022-10-08 07:58:08 damn
general 2022-10-08 07:58:40 yeah the stairs really aren't safe lmao
general 2022-10-08 07:58:51 they are glass
general 2022-10-08 07:59:36 it will fail every safety check
general 2022-10-08 08:00:19 it actually would be stronger
general 2022-10-08 08:00:38 are they even legal?
general 2022-10-08 08:00:49 there's no guardrail
general 2022-10-08 08:00:55 it's literally held in by the wall
general 2022-10-08 08:01:05 made of fucking glass
general 2022-10-08 08:01:10 (terrible idea)
general 2022-10-08 08:01:31 hi koy
general 2022-10-08 08:01:37 isn't it like really late for you?
general 2022-10-08 08:01:47 fair
general 2022-10-08 08:02:09 trying to look at narc graphics again
general 2022-10-08 08:02:18 like they're there but i can't load the palette in
general 2022-10-08 08:02:44 these are background tiles btw
general 2022-10-08 08:03:14 ^
general 2022-10-08 08:03:24 and make sure to get more rest today
general 2022-10-08 08:03:41 holy shit that's even worse
general 2022-10-08 08:04:26 glass staircases
general 2022-10-08 08:04:32 pinnacle of safety
general 2022-10-08 08:05:28 <@740790456182636595> i tested the segapcm stuff in deflemask by putting starfox samples in lol
general 2022-10-08 08:05:49 sorry
general 2022-10-08 08:06:09 good idea
general 2022-10-08 08:06:29 it's so weird hearing the heavy guitar as a segapcm sample
general 2022-10-08 08:06:43 i got scammed with this because i can only use 5 pcm channels
general 2022-10-08 08:07:01 there are supposed to be 16 channels
general 2022-10-08 08:07:09 5 isn't even half
general 2022-10-08 08:09:03 it's so funny that i can't stream narc
general 2022-10-08 08:09:13 it's a game from like 1988
general 2022-10-08 08:09:28 but it has many filtered words here
general 2022-10-08 08:12:33 they're there for a reason
general 2022-10-08 08:13:48 they are real
general 2022-10-08 08:13:58 well i know scout's one is real
general 2022-10-08 08:14:37 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1028218686378627122
general 2022-10-08 08:15:05 some of them are concepts yes but the fact that they are being produced and installed isn't great
general 2022-10-08 08:15:16 how
general 2022-10-08 08:16:03 it's held in by the wall, no guard rails, the actual brackets to hold the glass look thin
general 2022-10-08 08:16:53 i didn't think about that holy shit
general 2022-10-08 08:17:00 stairs would be ruined
general 2022-10-08 08:19:08 so?
general 2022-10-08 08:19:12 it's still unsafe
general 2022-10-08 08:21:47 smartest pcc member
general 2022-10-08 08:22:23 someone is trying to say it's safe lmao
general 2022-10-08 08:24:06 scout what is that picture from
general 2022-10-08 08:27:16 that's good
general 2022-10-08 08:27:22 sucks that you still have a headache
general 2022-10-08 08:28:28 hipster typic is trying to say that a glass staircase without guardrails is safe
general 2022-10-08 08:28:34 it's so smart
general 2022-10-08 08:29:23 yes
general 2022-10-08 08:29:27 we are in the future
general 2022-10-08 08:31:34 i hate coding despite working with starfox source code

general 2022-10-08 09:06:52 yeah the videos that were leaked look very early on in development
general 2022-10-08 09:07:13 they wouldn’t give a release date to a game that is still in that state

general 2022-10-09 00:01:30 hyperduel samples but segapcm instead of whatever the original game used
general 2022-10-09 00:01:34 so fucking weird

general 2022-10-09 00:11:15 koy even i wouldn't be able to find this shit
general 2022-10-09 00:13:44 steam deck is meant for better games
general 2022-10-09 00:15:55 owner likes children don't play it
general 2022-10-09 00:16:41 typical that's kind of fucked up since they were asking actual people for pics
general 2022-10-09 00:16:56 i thought this was common knowledge by now
general 2022-10-09 00:17:49 i'll just leave it at that and not mention it again
general 2022-10-09 00:19:20 someone found a starfox 2 sample ages ago but idk if they'll add it to the spreadsheet
general 2022-10-09 00:19:24 idk what to do
general 2022-10-09 00:19:43 even made a graph to prove it's the right sample
general 2022-10-09 00:20:10 also one of the composers of starfox 2 worked on f-zero and that has tons of korg m1 usage
general 2022-10-09 00:20:33 i really want this on the sheet but when i asked the guy about it he just said he'll consider it
general 2022-10-09 00:20:38 it's been like a month
general 2022-10-09 00:28:11 azzy was cool
general 2022-10-09 00:28:17 idk why he left

general 2022-10-09 00:32:46 stable game
general 2022-10-09 00:33:09 wait i just realised where the hell would they place starfox 2 on the spreadsheet
general 2022-10-09 00:33:19 it was meant for a 1996 release but came out in 2017
general 2022-10-09 00:33:28 so what date would they use
general 2022-10-09 00:37:42 i assume they'll go by the intended release date and place it before sf64
general 2022-10-09 00:39:11 i don't feel like playing roblox so i probably won't join again
general 2022-10-09 01:07:36 welcome back smiley

general 2022-10-09 22:45:53 oh no
general 2022-10-09 22:46:34 yeah he isn't
general 2022-10-09 22:50:35 would be funny

general 2022-10-09 22:53:41 he thinks that comedi had some not great dms with you

general 2022-10-09 23:07:39 entire top end is gone and it ends sooner than the source sample
general 2022-10-09 23:09:09 you can sort of hear the resemblance in corneria's theme
general 2022-10-09 23:09:13 the pitch might be off still
general 2022-10-09 23:11:10 band clear turned out sort of alright i still don't have all the yamaha samples
general 2022-10-09 23:14:10 the 1st one is so broken that he's basically forced to make another

general 2022-10-12 03:30:01 but more of the superfx/cg board type stuff
general 2022-10-12 03:30:13 flat shaded
general 2022-10-12 03:30:16 minimal textures
general 2022-10-12 03:33:35 skoove are you aussie
general 2022-10-12 03:34:16 no not everyone in australia is like that
general 2022-10-12 03:34:24 stop believing misinformation
general 2022-10-12 03:35:26 i really need to try ultrakill
general 2022-10-12 03:36:04 i don't think it'll be good for me though
general 2022-10-12 03:36:44 nope
general 2022-10-12 03:57:23 no
general 2022-10-12 03:57:32 i don't get it as well
general 2022-10-12 05:15:15 the game’s a grindfest though
general 2022-10-12 05:16:25 it’s the worst of the modern game industry
general 2022-10-12 05:16:46 decent ideas built on a p2w format
general 2022-10-12 05:17:29 yeah it’s a much better game though
general 2022-10-12 05:17:53 i’m saying botw is a much better game
general 2022-10-12 05:17:59 i worded it wrong lmao
general 2022-10-12 05:18:18 botw is amazing
general 2022-10-12 05:18:37 really reminds me of how super metroid does things
general 2022-10-12 05:19:08 vastly different genre but operates sort of similarly
general 2022-10-12 05:19:37 if you’re good, you can just speed through it and get to the end quickly
general 2022-10-12 05:20:02 yeah
general 2022-10-12 05:20:09 go straight to ganon
general 2022-10-12 05:20:15 sequel isn’t out yet
general 2022-10-12 05:20:35 are you talking about that spinoff?
general 2022-10-12 05:20:44 it was like age of calamity or something
general 2022-10-12 05:21:28 age of calamity is a dynasty warriors game in my eyes, far from a zelda game
general 2022-10-12 05:21:35 honestly didn’t like it
general 2022-10-12 05:21:55 the original botw is amazing though
general 2022-10-12 05:22:11 champion’s ballad
general 2022-10-12 05:22:44 on my master mode save i went straight to hyrule castle after plateau
general 2022-10-12 05:23:06 skill

general 2022-10-12 05:23:56 how
general 2022-10-12 05:24:25 tears of the kingdom will be worth the wait
general 2022-10-12 05:26:07 they’re building off the original which means stuff from botw will be refined
general 2022-10-12 05:26:29 i’ve got like max level ancient gear
general 2022-10-12 05:27:26 oh my god lmao
general 2022-10-12 05:28:07 now when’s the next starfox game coming out
general 2022-10-12 05:28:21 zero doesn’t count since it’s literally starfox 64
general 2022-10-12 05:28:30 yeah
general 2022-10-12 05:29:09 the latest game was starfox 2
general 2022-10-12 05:29:24 technically at least
general 2022-10-12 05:29:55 the last mention of starfox was a tweet about playing starfox 2 on nso
general 2022-10-12 05:30:53 there is way worse

general 2022-10-12 06:27:49 well this is readable code not like asm
general 2022-10-12 06:28:07 asm is sort of readable if you know all the stuff

general 2022-10-12 06:28:34 lol
general 2022-10-12 06:29:22 means you can sort of read snes and nes source code
general 2022-10-12 06:29:24 i hope
general 2022-10-12 06:29:30 except starfox 1 and 2
general 2022-10-12 06:29:39 that's all custom

general 2022-10-12 06:32:10 koy you tell me to sleep more but you sleep at like 5am smh
general 2022-10-12 06:36:30 level setup code for starfox 1 is easy as
general 2022-10-12 06:36:57 like it literally says what's being used and enabled
general 2022-10-12 06:37:16 gamepal is the 16 colour palette for the models and shit
general 2022-10-12 06:37:28 palette is the actual main palette being used
general 2022-10-12 06:37:58 stp is corneria's graphics and tilemap (since that's the name of it in the data folder)
general 2022-10-12 06:38:43 and then all the axes of camera rotation and the superfx effect
general 2022-10-12 06:39:12 i'm alright
general 2022-10-12 06:39:17 hbu
general 2022-10-12 06:49:01 oh so the original name for out of this dimension was nebula

general 2022-10-12 06:49:40 this chat is so cursed holy shit lmao
general 2022-10-12 06:50:39 fuck i have to find the map graphics
general 2022-10-12 06:50:51 i don't know what every graphics file is
general 2022-10-12 06:51:03 they have the most basic names
general 2022-10-12 06:51:16 how was i supposed to guess that stp is corneria
general 2022-10-12 06:52:20 well that was easy
general 2022-10-12 06:52:31 i thought it had a weird name
general 2022-10-12 06:53:04 can't actually send it here since it's part of the leaked source code
general 2022-10-12 06:55:47 infected
general 2022-10-12 06:56:08 don't ask
general 2022-10-12 06:56:14 just don't

general 2022-10-12 06:58:08 true
general 2022-10-12 06:58:42 good idea
general 2022-10-12 06:58:54 water supremacy
general 2022-10-12 07:01:27 so you just don't buy enough soda for everyone
general 2022-10-12 07:01:32 good mindset
general 2022-10-12 07:01:46 stockpile
general 2022-10-12 07:02:22 koy is an expert at staying up at ungodly hours

general 2022-10-12 07:05:07 hi hipster
general 2022-10-12 07:05:17 remember you can talk about this stuff if you need to
general 2022-10-12 07:05:46 do they really care though?
general 2022-10-12 07:05:50 think about it
general 2022-10-12 07:06:14 i've got email records about the bathroom incident at nintendo
general 2022-10-12 07:06:19 i forgot what it was about
general 2022-10-12 07:06:29 but it wasn't good
general 2022-10-12 07:07:35 or i'm probably misremembering with the argonaut email archives
general 2022-10-12 07:07:53 where they got caught spreading some not great content around
general 2022-10-12 07:10:30 the starfox 2 meteor theme is just so different compared to the entire ost
general 2022-10-12 07:10:46 the final one not the other one from the ces build
general 2022-10-12 07:11:04 although that one's still pretty good
general 2022-10-12 07:12:41 mellony
general 2022-10-12 07:13:16 eladard theme was bad in wces glad they changed it
general 2022-10-12 07:13:43 final one is leagues ahead

general 2022-10-12 07:14:03 lmao
general 2022-10-12 07:15:43 wces one is a 13 second loop

general 2022-10-12 07:19:29 literally
general 2022-10-12 07:19:55 tells me to sleep but she only goes to bed for like 2 hours lmao
general 2022-10-12 07:22:32 starfox 1 already had the faster superfx speed programmed into the strats but they had to use half of the clock speed because they started development with the slower speed
general 2022-10-12 07:22:47 yeah but you should sleep too smh
general 2022-10-12 07:23:00 for more than 2 hours
general 2022-10-12 07:23:44 
general 2022-10-12 07:24:05 starfox 2 had like an entirely different team apart from a few people
general 2022-10-12 07:24:23 dylan cuthbert was still there but giles went to stunt race fx
general 2022-10-12 07:24:36 hi akimov

general 2022-10-12 07:28:33 open all the ports to fix online
general 2022-10-12 07:28:40 the best fix
general 2022-10-12 07:29:57 no seyo

general 2022-10-12 07:48:01 i forgot i added the old euclides boss trigger to the control test map
general 2022-10-12 07:49:13 forgot i built these all of of this initial attempt lol
general 2022-10-12 07:49:23 it's the corneria texture from starfox 1
general 2022-10-12 07:50:17 now time to wait for a while until i get to the boss trigger
general 2022-10-12 07:50:26 i guess i'll play a bit
general 2022-10-12 07:51:36 i got invincibility turned on so i can get to the boss trigger
general 2022-10-12 07:52:28 had to kill that thing but failed with bomb twice
general 2022-10-12 07:53:40 finally got to the trigger
general 2022-10-12 07:54:04 i can't kill it because can't figure out how to return player control
general 2022-10-12 07:54:18 so just stuck here until i go back to title
general 2022-10-12 07:55:10 wow another screenshot of the early euclides boss
general 2022-10-12 07:56:41 oh yeah i put the trigger here too
general 2022-10-12 07:56:48 it's meant to have the xenon boss
general 2022-10-12 07:57:01 bunch of testing builds i made
general 2022-10-12 07:57:15 i should get the other pack to get the proper boss in here

general 2022-10-12 09:35:56 i like it
general 2022-10-12 09:37:40 there's just something about it that makes it really open
general 2022-10-12 09:41:28 i mean i only say i listen to vgm but rarely talk about the other stuff i listen to
general 2022-10-12 09:41:41 i think i've only really talked to inventor about it

general 2022-10-16 00:46:16 <@513966516958658561> here's your answer
general 2022-10-16 00:46:47 you said i sounded 17 lmao
general 2022-10-16 00:47:47 the arcade option in deflemask is so bad
general 2022-10-16 00:47:54 you can't pitch samples
general 2022-10-16 00:48:22 even though like almost every game which used the segapcm changes the pitch of samples in the note data
general 2022-10-16 00:48:53 i know since i got samples out of multiple sample roms
general 2022-10-16 00:50:20 galaxy force 2, turbo outrun, g-loc, gp rider, and many other games use a pcm channel as the bass
general 2022-10-16 00:50:27 how can deflemask not do this properly
general 2022-10-16 00:52:12 like i can't do this shit in deflemask
general 2022-10-16 00:52:22 or use the full 16 channels of the chip
general 2022-10-16 00:52:31 only 5
general 2022-10-16 00:54:49 yeah
general 2022-10-16 00:54:54 it's what i do
general 2022-10-16 00:59:17 i just looked into the sample rom for galaxy force 2
general 2022-10-16 00:59:26 turns out there's a bunch of bass notes
general 2022-10-16 01:00:14 hipster did you think i was the same age as you
general 2022-10-16 01:00:26 wow
general 2022-10-16 01:00:42 15
general 2022-10-16 01:03:01 
general 2022-10-16 01:04:05 if this is all there is for galaxy force 2 then there should be a ton for gp rider
general 2022-10-16 01:09:31 gp rider only has one
general 2022-10-16 01:09:46 there must be something in the code to control pitch
general 2022-10-16 02:12:41 hi ferox

general 2022-10-17 11:43:43 i forgot if gp rider's guitar is the same as turbo outrun
general 2022-10-17 11:44:05 i'm thinking about doing something with the guitar sample and gp rider
general 2022-10-17 11:44:28 an arcade game
general 2022-10-17 11:44:34 it's not very good
general 2022-10-17 11:44:38 or i'm just terrible at it
general 2022-10-17 11:44:58 if you want to play a super scaler just go for outrun or power drift
general 2022-10-17 11:55:44 i still don't know why deflemask only lets you use 5 segapcm channels
general 2022-10-17 11:56:21 at that point you'd be better off using adpcm
general 2022-10-17 12:19:42 big gun
general 2022-10-17 12:19:48 that's all i know it as
general 2022-10-17 12:30:26 do you have to model some of this stuff or does navalart give you a bunch of parts for everything
general 2022-10-17 12:31:06 oh ok
general 2022-10-17 12:32:56 that's a lot
general 2022-10-17 12:33:18 wait what does the game mean by parts
general 2022-10-17 12:33:33 it's probably a stupid question but idk
general 2022-10-17 12:35:49 what the fuck
general 2022-10-17 12:35:51 since when
general 2022-10-17 12:35:59 i don't want to get a new romset
general 2022-10-17 12:36:14 i'm too lazy to get the new files
general 2022-10-17 12:44:14 i fixed it
general 2022-10-17 12:44:16 with minimal effort
general 2022-10-17 13:05:20 finger
general 2022-10-17 13:38:37 when are you going to go sleep
general 2022-10-17 13:39:06 not good to stay up too late
general 2022-10-17 13:39:16 even though i do it most of the time
general 2022-10-17 13:39:55 if you don't want to yet then just don't
general 2022-10-17 13:52:04 same

general 2022-10-18 00:56:37 like i kind of want to know now
general 2022-10-18 00:56:56 even though it's probably terrible
general 2022-10-18 04:38:17 <@740790456182636595> decided i don’t want to know about the thing
general 2022-10-18 04:39:45 hi rage

general 2022-10-18 06:54:26 hi
general 2022-10-18 07:00:53 went back to the starfox main theme and put some more original samples back in
general 2022-10-18 07:00:59 i can't wait for the official one
general 2022-10-18 07:09:41 hi
general 2022-10-18 07:09:47 gn
general 2022-10-18 07:09:56 even though it's not night lmao
general 2022-10-18 07:10:23 he is in the same timezone as me
general 2022-10-18 09:16:20 wow you're up
general 2022-10-18 09:51:02 the thing i remember the most about him is how he doxxed himself multiple times because he was called british
general 2022-10-18 09:53:58 it was a while ago
general 2022-10-18 09:54:05 i know he sent his address
general 2022-10-18 09:55:23 yeah
general 2022-10-18 09:55:53 i could tell because of the flags that were in his discord name
general 2022-10-18 09:56:06 and he said it in his about me iirc
general 2022-10-18 10:14:57 hi rage
general 2022-10-18 11:20:11 what does the pvp update involve
general 2022-10-18 12:08:39 hi hipster
general 2022-10-18 12:11:46 might go since i’m tired
general 2022-10-18 12:11:54 idk though
general 2022-10-18 12:19:52 wait what
general 2022-10-18 12:20:34 i kind of want to know more but don’t want to at the same time
general 2022-10-18 12:49:51 i've kept my profile the same for 3 years lmao
general 2022-10-18 12:50:02 except for the about me since that's new
general 2022-10-18 12:50:35 looks nice
general 2022-10-18 12:51:22 i just did another track that i didn't need to do since official restores are coming
general 2022-10-18 12:52:22 but i'm scared that each track will be released in order, so everything else is being held up by corneria (the original snare sample still isn't known yet)
general 2022-10-18 13:22:17 actually going to sleep now
general 2022-10-18 13:22:27 did the last thing i wanted to do with the spc2it stuff
general 2022-10-18 13:22:28 gn
general 2022-10-18 13:26:12 actually nvm i'm not going yet
general 2022-10-18 13:26:21 i got more ideas for stuff to do
general 2022-10-18 13:27:22 i'm sorry i just think of random sort of cool shit to do
general 2022-10-18 13:29:28 so there's a restored version of corneria being worked on
general 2022-10-18 13:30:19 it would be sick to hear a restored version of the track that inspired corneria, the main theme of afterburner
general 2022-10-18 13:30:54 the entire point of a segapcm track is to show off as many pcm channels as possible so it'd sound great
general 2022-10-18 13:31:22 i already know afterburner uses some roland gear and the korg ddd1
general 2022-10-18 13:32:06 (the main guitar is a lost in house recording though so it'll never happen)
general 2022-10-18 13:34:13 i don't even listen to frank sinatra yet i know who he is
general 2022-10-18 13:36:11 well at least most of hiro's tracks follow this idea
general 2022-10-18 13:39:35 so basically someone said you put way too much effort compiling your playlist
general 2022-10-18 13:39:46 what
general 2022-10-18 13:39:50 then what is it
general 2022-10-18 13:40:02 that's the only thing i can think of that sort of makes sense
general 2022-10-18 13:40:36 or the soundtrack is really high quality
general 2022-10-18 13:41:30 i listened to an album mel sent and i thought it was good
general 2022-10-18 13:41:56 it's almost 1am
general 2022-10-18 13:42:22 do it
general 2022-10-18 13:42:24 quick
general 2022-10-18 13:42:25 speedrun
general 2022-10-18 13:42:46 check out megaman x's ost
general 2022-10-18 13:43:18 not x2 or x3, the original x
general 2022-10-18 13:43:26 the snes version
general 2022-10-18 13:43:47 you have the wrong one
general 2022-10-18 13:44:00 the original megaman x game
general 2022-10-18 13:44:04 on the super nintendo
general 2022-10-18 13:45:09 https://youtu.be/tBWl9p0fH28

general 2022-10-18 13:46:00 love the game and the soundtrack is great
general 2022-10-18 13:46:38 yeah it's the original super nintendo one
general 2022-10-18 13:48:40 super metroid has some great atmospheric tracks
general 2022-10-18 13:51:00 <@740790456182636595> actually going for real this time
general 2022-10-18 21:06:00 hi

general 2022-10-19 09:32:53 i can finally run it really well
general 2022-10-19 09:33:25 most games are a bit buggy but pilotwings and f-zero work decently
general 2022-10-19 09:40:12 i might join and stream
general 2022-10-19 09:40:23 pilotwings or maybe something else
general 2022-10-19 09:40:24 idk

general 2022-10-19 10:09:20 i got new stuff on my other one but don't have it on this one
general 2022-10-19 10:09:35 can't be bothered with transferring stuff
general 2022-10-19 10:21:51 i wish i could disable bg1 to get rid of the black bars
general 2022-10-19 10:22:07 honestly wouldn't mind playing the original starfox like this
general 2022-10-19 11:01:27 just now
general 2022-10-19 11:31:06 <@874912257128136734> when did you leave vc

general 2022-10-19 11:44:11 file explorer freezes sometimes for me
general 2022-10-19 11:44:24 when dragging files from it into another program
general 2022-10-19 11:44:38 mostly with openmpt though
general 2022-10-19 11:51:51 fuck i really need those tg77 samples
general 2022-10-19 11:51:59 i don't want to wait for a single snare sample
general 2022-10-19 11:55:08 how did i not see it
general 2022-10-19 11:56:02 fair enough
general 2022-10-19 12:04:10 yeah idk how to feel about that

general 2022-10-19 12:05:30 leaving it at that

general 2022-10-21 11:15:05 do you see how this isn't right
general 2022-10-21 11:15:35 ok last track of the set

general 2022-10-21 11:16:53 that track is coming up in the next set
general 2022-10-21 11:17:33 it's "only you" by intense
general 2022-10-21 11:19:45 close enough
general 2022-10-21 11:21:46 playing a different set
general 2022-10-21 11:23:56 if you hate windows 10 do not use windows 11
general 2022-10-21 11:24:12 windows 5
general 2022-10-21 11:24:14 wtf
general 2022-10-21 11:24:18 there's no windows 5
general 2022-10-21 11:24:33 well technically windows 5 is 98
general 2022-10-21 11:28:23 who's this random
general 2022-10-21 11:28:50 he just joined vc
general 2022-10-21 11:29:11 who the fuck touched the youtube
general 2022-10-21 11:29:30 absolutely ruined the flow
general 2022-10-21 11:29:43 no it jumped around a bit
general 2022-10-21 11:31:14 only you can
general 2022-10-21 11:31:28 almost forgot that the peshay set had the track hypersleep
general 2022-10-21 11:31:30 love that one
general 2022-10-21 11:33:13 literally was all going well, some random joined and the youtube thing jumped forward magically
general 2022-10-21 11:33:19 absolutely love it
general 2022-10-21 11:33:54 yeah
general 2022-10-21 11:33:58 i just added something
general 2022-10-21 11:40:44 <@740790456182636595> you up
general 2022-10-21 11:41:23 i honestly love these sets
general 2022-10-21 11:41:26 wrf
general 2022-10-21 11:41:28 wtf
general 2022-10-21 11:42:47 i love this track
general 2022-10-21 11:46:03 he should come back here
general 2022-10-21 11:46:29 if you're wondering why the quality of these tracks aren't the best it's because it's a cassette transfer
general 2022-10-21 11:46:58 there's a hd version but i couldn't be bothered getting it
general 2022-10-21 11:48:48 gent if you touch the watch together
general 2022-10-21 11:48:50 i will
general 2022-10-21 11:48:58 complain
general 2022-10-21 11:50:08 it's worth it
general 2022-10-21 11:51:25 ok so the next track after hypersleep was the sax lick
general 2022-10-21 11:51:39 i thought it was going to be something else
general 2022-10-21 11:51:52 since my version has a few extra tracks
general 2022-10-21 11:59:05 side 2 is just too good
general 2022-10-21 11:59:17 it's got the breakdancing cat track
general 2022-10-21 12:01:44 that is in 2 months
general 2022-10-21 12:02:20 just a week away
general 2022-10-21 12:02:28 i am so happy about this information
general 2022-10-21 12:03:25 
general 2022-10-21 12:04:02 i spent like 2 hours doing this
general 2022-10-21 12:04:14 no gent
general 2022-10-21 12:04:35 lmao
general 2022-10-21 12:05:08 i think this is a photek track
general 2022-10-21 12:05:13 yeah it is
general 2022-10-21 12:06:06 we're like a bit more than halfway through the peshay set
general 2022-10-21 12:06:53 idk
general 2022-10-21 12:07:28 the unreleased pfm and peshay remix of an also unreleased track by ltj bukem is straight after
general 2022-10-21 12:07:45 alright gn
general 2022-10-21 12:08:31 i think there's like an option to give the remote to someone
general 2022-10-21 12:09:30 yes
general 2022-10-21 12:09:32 sorry
general 2022-10-21 12:11:56 i kind of want to skip this track but it'll ruin the flow
general 2022-10-21 12:12:06 i think it's ending soon though
general 2022-10-21 12:13:36 ok yeah the track motions has started
general 2022-10-21 12:18:32 he's not all there
general 2022-10-21 12:18:55 i think next track coming up
general 2022-10-21 12:19:37 yeah seyo's sleeping
general 2022-10-21 12:19:40 bye
general 2022-10-21 12:20:12 he's just staying in there
general 2022-10-21 12:20:18 idk if he's actually sleeping
general 2022-10-21 12:20:24 i love this track too
general 2022-10-21 12:21:31 i had no idea about these until like last year
general 2022-10-21 12:25:11 this is that song
general 2022-10-21 12:25:19 from the breakdancing cat meme
general 2022-10-21 12:26:27 real title is "only you" by intense
general 2022-10-21 12:38:42 oh shit we're already at the track links
general 2022-10-21 12:41:46 already did
general 2022-10-21 12:41:56 we got the unreleased remix of an unreleased track
general 2022-10-21 12:42:05 looking for others
general 2022-10-21 12:43:15 i kind of don't want to put another hour long set up
general 2022-10-21 12:43:30 if i do it's probably going to be trans central connection
general 2022-10-21 12:46:30 i thought about adding one of the atmosphere chapters to the list but it wouldn't really fit
general 2022-10-21 12:46:35 it's more modern
general 2022-10-21 12:47:31 i thought there was one more track in the peshay set wtf
general 2022-10-21 12:47:53 again getting misguided by my inaccurate version
general 2022-10-21 12:57:15 hi
general 2022-10-21 12:57:32 me seyo and razz were chilling in vc and listening to dnb
general 2022-10-21 12:58:20 for all of us is a great track
general 2022-10-21 12:58:43 haven't properly listened to the bailey set but i'll give it a shot

general 2022-10-21 13:38:54 lmao
general 2022-10-21 13:39:49 hell no
general 2022-10-21 13:39:59 i'm not gay
general 2022-10-21 13:42:48 there's like 5 hours of dnb content up on watch together
general 2022-10-21 13:42:59 hi
general 2022-10-21 13:43:08 a few sets, a few individual tracks
general 2022-10-21 13:43:43 almost there
general 2022-10-21 13:43:52 this is bound to happen again as well
general 2022-10-21 14:07:39 what’s he doing
general 2022-10-21 14:07:51 i swear if he’s touching
general 2022-10-21 14:07:54 the thing
general 2022-10-21 14:07:59 fuck you honestly
general 2022-10-21 14:08:11 i compiled this list
general 2022-10-21 14:08:23 read you can remove stuff and shit
general 2022-10-21 14:08:50 wait what
general 2022-10-21 14:09:04 just skip hermit craft
general 2022-10-21 14:09:18 i think it’s still set so seyo has perms
general 2022-10-21 14:10:09 he obviously didn’t read this
general 2022-10-21 14:10:38 i want this playlist to stay for a while
general 2022-10-21 14:12:43 what did they do
general 2022-10-21 14:12:48 send a ss
general 2022-10-21 14:12:57 i can’t
general 2022-10-21 14:13:03 i’m on iPad
general 2022-10-21 14:13:08 autocorrect
general 2022-10-21 14:15:03 hey <@744591826891046943> remove all that bullshit in watch together please

general 2022-10-21 14:17:39 <@456226577798135808> can you get up really quick and reassign me as host
general 2022-10-21 14:18:58 i also don't think you want to watch a really loud version of never gonna give you up so you're just trolling
general 2022-10-21 14:19:31 would've been fine if discord didn't fuck up the perms
general 2022-10-21 14:19:54 it was set so only the host could manage tracks
general 2022-10-21 14:20:08 but that 10 minute shit changed it
general 2022-10-21 14:20:39 lets do that
general 2022-10-21 14:20:46 i'll transfer the playlist
general 2022-10-21 14:20:58 fair
general 2022-10-21 14:24:08 trying to take screenshots so i can recreate this tomorrow
general 2022-10-21 14:24:28 sorry <@740790456182636595> someone decided to come in and ruin things
general 2022-10-21 15:22:50 no clue but we were listening to dnb

general 2022-10-21 15:40:42 i’ve never started or managed an event so idk how it works
general 2022-10-21 15:41:50 there’s like all the dnb stuff from me and then mortified and some random started adding random shit

general 2022-10-23 09:27:08 what do you do in stormworks
general 2022-10-23 09:27:41 is that it
general 2022-10-23 09:27:43 oh ok
general 2022-10-23 09:35:08 expecting an error to show up since this tool is extremely unstable
general 2022-10-23 09:35:18 holy shit no errors
general 2022-10-23 09:35:23 unheard of
general 2022-10-23 09:36:04 hi koy
general 2022-10-23 09:36:39 now where can i get yamaha rx15 samples
general 2022-10-23 09:36:52 aside from a real machine
general 2022-10-23 09:37:17 i wish
general 2022-10-23 09:37:38 one of those moving seat power drift cabs
general 2022-10-23 09:37:42 they're so rare
general 2022-10-23 09:40:49 i mean a virtua racing or daytona deluxe cab would be good too
general 2022-10-23 09:46:07 and so it begins
general 2022-10-23 10:11:32 what happened lol
general 2022-10-23 10:46:46 the one part i'm stuck on
general 2022-10-23 10:46:48 is the snare
general 2022-10-23 10:46:56 the thing i thought would be the easiest
general 2022-10-23 11:39:48 it's sort of done now
general 2022-10-23 11:40:24 i think it's alright
general 2022-10-23 11:40:27 just alright
general 2022-10-23 11:40:32 not terrible but not good
general 2022-10-23 11:44:48 
general 2022-10-23 11:45:11 the original outrun didn't really utilise the segapcm chip all too well so there's not much of an improvement
general 2022-10-23 11:45:46 also i think there's a couple things wrong with it so there's that
general 2022-10-23 12:22:42 it is what it is
general 2022-10-23 12:33:01 literally want to destroy this progam
general 2022-10-23 12:33:31 i want to spend hours dealing with all 16 channels but it doesn't let me
general 2022-10-23 12:34:18 i'll try the name entry theme and see if it works
general 2022-10-23 12:35:16 what the fuck
general 2022-10-23 12:35:19 it's 40 seconds long
general 2022-10-23 12:35:50 so true
general 2022-10-23 12:36:13 somehow a 7 minute track gets converted but not a 40 second one
general 2022-10-23 12:36:14 love it
general 2022-10-23 12:36:50 like if it's specifically for the outrun hardware at least say it's for the outrun hardware
general 2022-10-23 12:37:05 this might have to do with sound rom switching
general 2022-10-23 12:42:52 nvm i just didn't read properly, pcm support goes up to 11 channels for some reason
general 2022-10-23 12:49:44 have you looked
general 2022-10-23 12:50:07 the channel list
general 2022-10-23 12:50:15 there is one that clearly says colours

general 2022-10-27 09:49:23 and the australian version
general 2022-10-27 09:50:11 for some reason the option to change to mitsuyoshi’s vocals is just removed with the australian region setting

general 2022-10-27 09:53:37 i will not do a run of the city course

general 2022-10-27 23:48:19 afterburner 2 sound test is terrible
general 2022-10-27 23:48:25 each track stops after a few seconds
general 2022-10-27 23:48:35 what's the point of having a sound test then
general 2022-10-27 23:48:50 kind of need to test the sequence data too
general 2022-10-28 00:03:55 i just realised i'm basically taking away what makes afterburner 2's ost special

general 2022-10-30 04:57:14 i do every sample individually and then there's just a huge mess of volume mixing as soon as i unmute all
general 2022-10-30 04:57:18 it is what it is
general 2022-10-30 04:58:41 and then the orchestral hit sounds bad because the one in game is really compressed

general 2022-10-31 11:33:58 at least it's been archived
general 2022-10-31 11:35:44 i'm listening to atmosphere chapter 1 and the mc won't shut up about how it's chapter 1 and that it's mixed by nookie
general 2022-10-31 11:35:56 i can read i don't need this said to me
general 2022-10-31 11:36:52 that is in 2 months
general 2022-10-31 11:36:53 exactly
general 2022-10-31 11:37:55 
general 2022-10-31 11:41:02 almost died
general 2022-10-31 11:52:25 i totally don't have every bored ape nft in 1 folder
general 2022-10-31 11:52:37 the source files
general 2022-10-31 11:53:09 
general 2022-10-31 11:53:29 i am so good at using space
general 2022-10-31 12:04:12 trip to jaycar
general 2022-10-31 12:04:16 is it worth it
general 2022-10-31 12:06:05 it's like 5am for seyo he won't respond
general 2022-10-31 12:07:19 he just wanted to stay there
general 2022-10-31 12:07:36 i don't even know who that is
general 2022-10-31 12:08:13 what did they even do
general 2022-10-31 12:09:35 forbidden file
general 2022-10-31 12:09:58 to the max
general 2022-10-31 12:14:00 i think that's better
general 2022-10-31 12:14:16 he got unbanned
general 2022-10-31 12:14:28 i think
general 2022-10-31 13:13:50 is chips even up
general 2022-10-31 13:14:58 the game just isn't for me
general 2022-10-31 13:15:19 rather not sorry
general 2022-10-31 13:15:27 can't make me do stuff
general 2022-11-01 00:22:04 absolutely hate this
general 2022-11-01 00:22:28 i get the same track cut down to the exact length of the original
general 2022-11-01 00:22:39 put it in the import folder with the headers and shit
general 2022-11-01 00:22:41 doesn't work
general 2022-11-01 00:22:55 crashes the game instantly
general 2022-11-01 00:25:14 apparently the game just hates my fabricated .oggstr files
general 2022-11-01 00:25:32 i change the names of stage 1 and 2's tracks and they work fine
general 2022-11-01 00:28:57 one last try with this bullshit
general 2022-11-01 00:30:14 ok it literally just doesn't work wow
general 2022-11-01 00:31:13 literally using the same encoder as the original files, same track length, same header
general 2022-11-01 00:31:26 same tags as well
general 2022-11-01 01:28:24 it actually works now holy shit
general 2022-11-01 01:28:45 i didn't know there was an ending header in each .oggstr file
general 2022-11-01 01:31:12 next step is to get corneria into the game
general 2022-11-01 01:31:18 background and music track
general 2022-11-01 02:08:14 yes
general 2022-11-01 02:08:22 because he got too many pings
general 2022-11-01 02:10:10 well now i can make my own .oggstr and .stex files without using a hex editor
general 2022-11-01 02:11:01 i can't break shit now
general 2022-11-01 02:11:04 most of the time
general 2022-11-01 02:41:53 this happened 1 year ago
general 2022-11-01 02:41:58 wild year of 2003
general 2022-11-01 02:46:37 good news the new year 2004 site is back up

general 2022-11-01 05:58:09 oh ok

general 2022-11-01 08:40:37 a bit
general 2022-11-01 08:42:34 virtua cop is literally just all akai cd roms lmao
general 2022-11-01 08:42:45 there might be something from zero-g in there but idk
general 2022-11-01 09:01:54 i don't play stormworks but i can already tell that the person who did this made an absolute mess
general 2022-11-01 09:02:25 like barely any organisation (not that i'm any better with my own files)
general 2022-11-01 09:04:24 what are the basics of logic in stormworks
general 2022-11-01 09:04:49 oh no
general 2022-11-01 09:04:50 lua
general 2022-11-01 09:05:06 i do not do coding of any sort
general 2022-11-01 09:06:46 damn
general 2022-11-01 09:09:33 the closest i get is the proprietary argonaut scripting stuff for starfox 1 and 2
general 2022-11-01 09:09:53 only because it's easy to understand
general 2022-11-01 09:11:01 how the fuck
general 2022-11-01 09:17:35 yeah true
general 2022-11-01 09:25:59 original design had 4kb of rom
general 2022-11-01 09:26:17 that's as much as most atari 2600 cartridges
general 2022-11-01 09:28:46 actually i think the specs of that design is basically an atari 2600
general 2022-11-01 09:29:00 like the most barebones form, no bank switching
general 2022-11-01 09:33:39 hi cheese

general 2022-11-01 10:37:03 no he seriously is
general 2022-11-01 10:37:10 gammarad is racist
general 2022-11-01 10:37:33 because he made a not very good plane
general 2022-11-01 10:37:43 with a few racial slurs on it
general 2022-11-01 10:37:45 only a few
general 2022-11-01 10:38:39 wasn't cheese in birb gang or no
general 2022-11-01 10:41:17 gamma was cool but not a fan of racist stuff
general 2022-11-01 10:41:31 exactly
general 2022-11-01 10:42:33 so are you gammarad or nah
general 2022-11-01 10:42:40 genuinely confused lol
general 2022-11-01 10:42:55 true

general 2022-11-01 11:02:53 i regret getting it
general 2022-11-01 11:03:52 the song will actually be 30 years old in 2 years
general 2022-11-01 11:03:58 i can't believe it

general 2022-11-01 11:26:28 i can't accept that it's going to be 30 years old
general 2022-11-01 11:27:12 yeah at one point it was raining hard here
general 2022-11-01 11:27:18 went away quickly though
general 2022-11-01 11:28:01 get rest
general 2022-11-01 11:28:59 yeah i feel like that sometimes
general 2022-11-01 11:29:37 yesterday i went at like 11:30
general 2022-11-01 11:29:41 (unheard of for me)
general 2022-11-01 11:30:04 i usually go at around 1 or 2
general 2022-11-01 11:30:14 not healthy at all but it's just how i do things
general 2022-11-01 11:31:58 i never get it that bad
general 2022-11-01 11:32:04 hope it gets better
general 2022-11-01 11:32:36 average regular discussion in pcc
general 2022-11-01 11:34:05 i think you're thinking about the wrong thing
general 2022-11-01 11:34:22 true
general 2022-11-01 11:34:59 i hate the orchestra hit in virtua cop
general 2022-11-01 11:35:05 sounds bad
general 2022-11-01 11:35:25 i do like the usage of guitar loops though
general 2022-11-01 11:36:02 yeah the arcade ost
general 2022-11-01 11:36:15 i think there's only like a couple tracks which use guitar loops
general 2022-11-01 11:36:40 i know for a fact that stage 1's track uses a guitar loop
general 2022-11-01 11:37:12 i tried to look for it in the zero-g datafiles but no luck
general 2022-11-01 11:37:35 not sure if it's a live recording like what hiro did with afterburner or from a sample library
general 2022-11-01 11:37:40 good to hear
general 2022-11-01 11:38:09 i'm leaning more towards it being from a sample library
general 2022-11-01 11:40:55 like yeah it fits but i just don't like it
general 2022-11-01 11:44:39 he is the entirety of school
general 2022-11-01 12:14:36 might just randomly not respond because tired

general 2022-11-02 11:43:47 pcc hunger games

general 2022-11-03 07:24:30 hi cheese
general 2022-11-03 07:24:40 hru
general 2022-11-03 07:24:55 hi perion
general 2022-11-03 07:25:18 yes
general 2022-11-03 07:25:35 i'm trying to get outrun 2 working properly again
general 2022-11-03 07:26:03 currently only things that work is the sound and graphics
general 2022-11-03 07:33:36 i fucking set it to run at 60fps but it goes at 80 instead
general 2022-11-03 07:33:40 love it
general 2022-11-03 07:33:47 no
general 2022-11-03 07:33:58 i'm trying to get outrun 2 working
general 2022-11-03 07:34:10 it would be funny if i got it though
general 2022-11-03 07:34:35 because that's what i got a gaming pc for
general 2022-11-03 07:34:36 totally
general 2022-11-03 07:36:36 it's actually outrun 2 sp sdx but i don't want to type it everytime
general 2022-11-03 07:43:35 holy shit
general 2022-11-03 07:43:41 i fixed the speed somehow
general 2022-11-03 07:43:59 i just did an entire run with normal speed
general 2022-11-03 07:45:32 teknoparrot is still a piece of shit though
general 2022-11-03 07:45:55 choice between fullscreen or window mode where you can't see the bottom of the screen
general 2022-11-03 07:46:29 still works at least
general 2022-11-03 07:53:10 ok there's a bit of a sound issue at some points
general 2022-11-03 08:03:49 alright i think outrun 2 is the only arcade racer i feel comfortable streaming because it looks like i sort of have an idea on what i'm doing
general 2022-11-03 08:04:19 can't play daytona 1 or 2 properly at all lol
general 2022-11-03 08:25:24 literally worst run i've done so far but still won
general 2022-11-03 08:26:25 i doubt the internet ranking works
general 2022-11-03 08:27:20 outrun 2
general 2022-11-03 08:27:25 but this is sp sdx
general 2022-11-03 08:27:46 you need teknoparrot to run this game on modern pcs
general 2022-11-03 08:29:04 yeah
general 2022-11-03 08:30:00 this version of outrun 2 ran on the lindbergh hardware not the chihiro
general 2022-11-03 08:33:30 wish i could play this game on actual hardware though
general 2022-11-03 08:33:50 there's a few graphical errors with using teknoparrot
general 2022-11-03 08:34:06 all good
general 2022-11-03 08:34:51 surprisingly no
general 2022-11-03 08:48:09 want to join vc or nah?
general 2022-11-03 08:49:43 alright cool
general 2022-11-03 08:49:50 honestly outrun 2 too easy
general 2022-11-03 09:01:13 nice
general 2022-11-03 09:17:31 no more outrun 2
general 2022-11-03 09:21:20 cheese should i stay here or move to cheese kingdom
general 2022-11-03 09:22:29 eh i'll stay here then
general 2022-11-03 09:22:32 that's fine
general 2022-11-03 09:23:34 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/497142796961054721/1017043663244775454/kersal_massive.gif
general 2022-11-03 09:23:44 it happens
general 2022-11-03 09:24:41 where did i put all my segapcm conversions
general 2022-11-03 09:24:44 i am going insane
general 2022-11-03 09:27:35 2104
general 2022-11-03 09:27:38 it will be gone
general 2022-11-03 09:38:57 holy shit i just realised super hang on uses the rx15 as well
general 2022-11-03 09:39:29 i really don't want to fuck around with instruments anymore after doing magical sound shower though lmao
general 2022-11-03 09:39:43 maybe just sprinter though
general 2022-11-03 09:40:58 if the conversion even decides to work that is
general 2022-11-03 09:49:04 something is definitely wrong with the conversion
general 2022-11-03 09:49:09 terribly wrong
general 2022-11-03 09:50:13 no point streaming it anymore since the sequence is fucked
general 2022-11-03 09:50:36 notes are repeated even though they aren't in the original sequence data
general 2022-11-03 09:52:08 i could do the original hang on
general 2022-11-03 09:52:36 idk if it's the same driver as outrun though
general 2022-11-03 09:53:53 is that like the stormworks server
general 2022-11-03 09:55:59 hi rage
general 2022-11-03 09:56:15 holy shit the sequence isn't messed up for the original hang on
general 2022-11-03 10:10:46 i can't find this one sample
general 2022-11-03 10:10:52 this was meant to be easy
general 2022-11-03 10:11:09 fuck this
general 2022-11-03 10:20:54 on steam it's overall very positive
general 2022-11-03 10:22:51 idk
general 2022-11-03 10:24:18 bored
general 2022-11-03 10:24:54 oh wait i just realised i can update some of the starfox alpha "restores"
general 2022-11-03 10:25:01 since more shit got found
general 2022-11-03 10:25:11 sadly no guitar still
general 2022-11-03 10:42:23 i think i actually did something alright with spc2it
general 2022-11-03 10:42:50 i am impatient and it's been 2 weeks
general 2022-11-03 11:06:49 i've just got some stuff running cause i'm bored as

general 2022-11-04 07:18:44 how do you sleep at those hours and manage to get up like 2 hours later
general 2022-11-04 07:18:49 absolutely insane

general 2022-11-04 07:48:59 pcc really has been on a downwards spiral though
general 2022-11-04 07:49:04 undeniable

general 2022-11-04 23:29:01 i'm convinced it's in development hell

general 2022-11-04 23:29:31 yeah i kind of don't care about pc2 anymore
general 2022-11-04 23:29:47 like if it comes out then it's out

general 2022-11-04 23:35:22 the other server i'm active in has no set in stone rules but still manages to be chill
general 2022-11-04 23:36:02 it's a starfox hacking server
general 2022-11-04 23:36:37 also very hyped cause it's basically ready to go
general 2022-11-04 23:37:35 the final track just got finished so the rest of it can finally be tweaked
general 2022-11-04 23:38:44 don't ask
general 2022-11-04 23:39:35 a few years ago i bought pokemon sun (worst decision)
general 2022-11-04 23:39:54 pokemon games are boring as shit to me, just can't get into them
general 2022-11-04 23:41:31 yeah he's said it a lot
general 2022-11-04 23:41:47 i think you even joined when he was in vc so
general 2022-11-04 23:42:06 wait you're learning guitar?
general 2022-11-04 23:42:19 oh sick
general 2022-11-04 23:42:35 i wish i could play something but i've got no talent
general 2022-11-04 23:45:04 are there any eshays
general 2022-11-04 23:46:05 he lives in australia
general 2022-11-04 23:47:03 wait actually
general 2022-11-04 23:47:08 i didn't know that
general 2022-11-04 23:47:18 i've just always been in australia
general 2022-11-04 23:49:31 if it was real i wouldn't be surprised lol
general 2022-11-04 23:51:02 i absolutely love outrun 2 but most of the original music tracks suck
general 2022-11-04 23:51:20 the best tracks are still the original 3 from outrun
general 2022-11-04 23:51:43 the arranged versions included by default in outrun 2 sound good
general 2022-11-04 23:55:00 
general 2022-11-04 23:55:06 i'm allowed to do this since sega can't even release outrun 2 anymore without heavily modifying it
general 2022-11-04 23:55:38 they lost the ferrari license so every single playable car has to be changed for it to be released again
general 2022-11-04 23:56:19 kobe bryant yeah
general 2022-11-04 23:57:41 i swear someone is going to resurrect the internet ranking for the arcade version of outrun 2 using sorcery
general 2022-11-04 23:57:55 hi rage
general 2022-11-04 23:58:25 i might actually work on splash wave
general 2022-11-04 23:58:36 it's torture but i want to hear hd pcm
general 2022-11-04 23:58:47 the song from the original outrun
general 2022-11-04 23:58:52 (i don't even have the right snare)
general 2022-11-05 00:00:03 i already did magical sound shower as a test but i want more
general 2022-11-05 00:00:29 no it sounds bad
general 2022-11-05 00:00:36 well i think it does
general 2022-11-05 00:00:46 i had a version with the bass but idk where that one is
general 2022-11-05 00:01:14 original outrun and super hang on use the yamaha rx15
general 2022-11-05 00:12:32 this is how i get the sequences after converting them
general 2022-11-05 00:12:42 i have to reconstruct it from this
general 2022-11-05 00:13:06 outrun doesn't even use most of the pcm channels so it's actually one of the easier ones
general 2022-11-05 00:14:17 ok
general 2022-11-05 00:26:57 oh shit i forgot i had outrunners midis
general 2022-11-05 00:27:04 from that tool i compiled
general 2022-11-05 03:09:55 i completely forgot about that guy
general 2022-11-05 05:48:51 laptop mouse being terrible again
general 2022-11-05 05:48:56 hate the scroll wheel
general 2022-11-05 05:53:25 this shows we are truly living in modern 2004 society
general 2022-11-05 05:54:10 hi perion
general 2022-11-05 05:54:31 i just tried to fix the scroll wheel with a screwdriver
general 2022-11-05 05:54:53 i would open it up and give it a proper look over but i don't have the right size torx bit
general 2022-11-05 05:55:19 one of those microsoft bluetooth mice
general 2022-11-05 05:55:26 mobile mouse or some shit
general 2022-11-05 08:31:08 hi cheese

general 2022-11-05 08:34:28 i was smart and didn't organise stuff
general 2022-11-05 08:37:56 ^
general 2022-11-05 08:38:45 i know basically nothing about planes despite being here lol
general 2022-11-05 08:40:47 anyway i got some midis from some model 2 arcade games because i finally figured out how to build the tool
general 2022-11-05 08:41:15 i've only done manx tt superbike so far but working on virtua cop 2
general 2022-11-05 08:41:34 (sadly no daytona usa or original virtua cop)
general 2022-11-05 08:42:10 oh i forgot i didn't have the virtua cop ost on here
general 2022-11-05 08:45:29 cyberpunk man
general 2022-11-05 08:47:06 i'll see if this one works
general 2022-11-05 08:50:08 wtf was that argument
general 2022-11-05 08:50:14 dumbest shit happens here
general 2022-11-05 08:52:51 honestly the new tracks in outrun 2 are kind of not as good as the original 3
general 2022-11-05 08:53:13 in literally every outrun game which includes the original tracks
general 2022-11-05 08:53:15 they are the best
general 2022-11-05 08:53:21 every single time
general 2022-11-05 08:58:26 i'm bored as shit cause i said i would do something today but gave up as soon as i started
general 2022-11-05 08:59:08 i wanted to hear it
general 2022-11-05 08:59:25 but too much to do with it
general 2022-11-05 08:59:36 the raw sequence is a mess
general 2022-11-05 08:59:52 yeah i don't ever want to drink
general 2022-11-05 09:00:35 i think the thing even has a few issues
general 2022-11-05 09:02:05 do you think i'd like stormworks or no
general 2022-11-05 09:02:25 i am bad at deciding
general 2022-11-05 09:03:13 no i hate
general 2022-11-05 09:03:14 coding
general 2022-11-05 09:03:53 i just can't be bothered learning to understand it
general 2022-11-05 09:04:20 i know lua is an easy language
general 2022-11-05 09:05:07 i'll probably be alright with logic but i just hate coding
general 2022-11-05 09:06:06 hate coding but have to edit source code to test things
general 2022-11-05 09:06:09 insane
general 2022-11-05 09:07:03 i have this one guy added on switch who has like 1000 hours on splatoon 2 so you're fine

general 2022-11-05 13:52:54 time passes too quickly
general 2022-11-05 13:53:46 i’m on that 1am mindset
general 2022-11-05 13:55:44 headphones have been existing for like a century deal with it
general 2022-11-05 13:56:02 i need a proper pair
general 2022-11-05 13:56:35 battleship was one of the movies of all time
general 2022-11-05 13:56:47 i watched it a few times

general 2022-11-14 09:18:26 i think i just figured out looping
general 2022-11-14 09:18:32 it's because i was stupid
general 2022-11-14 09:18:37 and didn't set loop point
general 2022-11-14 09:18:56 in my godot asset generator project

general 2022-11-14 09:35:18 i hate the quality though
general 2022-11-14 09:35:36 instead of importing ogg files i should import flac files instead
general 2022-11-14 09:35:49 and change all the shit in game to flac
general 2022-11-14 09:47:26 i just realised how much i have to do to make it look like corneria
general 2022-11-14 10:20:06 i think the loop actually works
general 2022-11-14 10:20:10 holy shit
general 2022-11-14 10:26:23 that’s good

general 2022-11-16 12:05:29 but i think power edition has the slight edge over battle on the edge
general 2022-11-16 12:06:06 like yeah bote has the customisable hornet classic but you have to put in a stupid ass code to use it
general 2022-11-16 12:07:10 forest dome is undeniably a better looking stage than the beginner stage from power edition though

general 2022-11-20 12:21:15 i have the stupid dolby audio app on my laptop because it came preinstalled
general 2022-11-20 12:26:02 the track mixing for the saturn version of hyper duel is really something
general 2022-11-20 12:26:41 stage 2's theme imported into audacity

general 2022-11-20 13:54:09 1am
general 2022-11-20 14:17:06 <@740790456182636595> i sleep
general 2022-11-20 14:17:50 gn cheese
general 2022-11-20 21:11:54 that’s really not good
general 2022-11-20 21:12:50 remember you always have dms if you want to
general 2022-11-20 21:12:55 you know
general 2022-11-20 21:13:35 alright

general 2022-11-20 22:01:01 hi koy
general 2022-11-20 22:01:04 hru
general 2022-11-20 22:01:35 well that's good
general 2022-11-20 22:03:24 still worried about stuff
general 2022-11-20 22:10:56 like they just slapped an iso onto a mobile emulator and called it a port?
general 2022-11-20 22:11:19 well that's kind of low effort
general 2022-11-20 22:12:39 i mean after burner climax was fully ported to mobile and that's a 2006 lindbergh hardware arcade game
general 2022-11-20 22:13:25 real shame scud race and daytona 2 will never be ported
general 2022-11-20 22:13:35 due to licensing issues
general 2022-11-20 22:14:22 aka sega super gt if you are in other regions
general 2022-11-20 22:14:41 climax was even ported to ps3
general 2022-11-20 22:15:28 i played the original sega rally championship on the model 2 emulator
general 2022-11-20 22:16:27 i know sega rally championship had a sega saturn release
general 2022-11-20 22:16:44 along with 2 ports of the original daytona usa
general 2022-11-20 22:17:01 (they both sucked)
general 2022-11-20 22:19:56 best port of the original daytona usa is the xbox 360/ps3 version
general 2022-11-20 22:20:12 best port of virtua racing is the switch version
general 2022-11-20 22:20:56 i think that version was directly based off of sega racing classic
general 2022-11-20 22:21:11 virtua racing switch is eshop only
general 2022-11-20 22:21:46 there's also a great release of outrun and g-loc on the switch
general 2022-11-20 22:22:50 i still have to try to get after burner climax working on teknoparrot
general 2022-11-20 22:23:23 don't bother with daytona championship usa it's worse than the originals
general 2022-11-21 00:19:51 like discord user?

general 2022-11-23 09:31:49 i probably have a better sound system than a real scud race arcade cabinet
general 2022-11-23 09:32:16 literally a sub right next to me
general 2022-11-23 09:52:27 wait i didn't even know you were out lol
general 2022-11-23 09:55:28 what sound will it make when we throw it up at the roof
general 2022-11-23 10:00:34 wish i could see it
general 2022-11-23 10:03:37 no way
general 2022-11-23 10:03:43 i won the scud race (singular)
general 2022-11-23 10:06:48 that does look really nice
general 2022-11-23 10:13:00 throw it up at a metal roof to see what sound it makes
general 2022-11-23 10:21:19 scud race
general 2022-11-23 10:21:36 1996/1997 model 3 arcade game
general 2022-11-23 10:21:47 first one for the hardware
general 2022-11-23 10:28:35 you might know of daytona usa 2 (any version)
general 2022-11-23 10:28:45 was built on the scud race engine

general 2022-11-23 13:20:36 incredible
general 2022-11-23 13:34:23 they should probably go and fix it because it might be a crucial part of the game lol
general 2022-11-23 13:34:36 it just might be crucial
general 2022-11-23 14:17:45 you should snoozer maybe
general 2022-11-23 14:17:50 1:17
general 2022-11-23 14:30:43 one of the moments ever

general 2022-11-24 05:40:16 have you read <#925522972586967092>
general 2022-11-24 05:41:54 nobody reads readme files or any of that shit
general 2022-11-24 05:42:22 this is why we need that dyno thing
general 2022-11-24 05:43:52 i have first hand experience with people not reading shit and then reporting on stuff that's in the readme
general 2022-11-24 05:44:12 it's so frustrating since the stuff is all there but they just don't bother
general 2022-11-24 06:16:04 bypass
general 2022-11-24 11:07:40 hi kiiro
general 2022-11-24 11:07:45 did zero really join back

general 2022-11-24 11:09:16 cheese how was your 4am sleep lmao
general 2022-11-24 11:10:07 i ended up going at like 3:40
general 2022-11-24 11:10:18 and i felt not great
general 2022-11-24 11:10:29 (expected)
general 2022-11-24 11:12:48 when will he stop
general 2022-11-24 11:14:33 i love the clear bias here
general 2022-11-24 11:14:37 makes it funny
general 2022-11-24 11:15:35 this will severely affect fishing season
general 2022-11-24 11:23:28 last surviving video from 1998 (6 years ago)
general 2022-11-24 11:23:57 we don't know what happened before 2000
general 2022-11-24 11:28:06 10 volume
general 2022-11-24 11:28:08 how
general 2022-11-24 11:28:08 what
general 2022-11-24 11:28:19 i always have my earbuds at 42 volume
general 2022-11-24 11:29:01 i would never use 100 volume
general 2022-11-24 11:30:25 i honestly need to get a phone soon cause it's actually useful
general 2022-11-24 11:30:42 yeah i told you lma
general 2022-11-24 11:30:46 like a while ago
general 2022-11-24 11:30:57 2 ipads but no phone
general 2022-11-24 11:30:59 wild
general 2022-11-24 11:31:09 i don't even know when i last charged my ipad pro
general 2022-11-24 11:31:57 how
general 2022-11-24 11:32:07 you got it like a month or 2 ago
general 2022-11-24 11:33:25 this is my total playtime with my music player since like mid 2020
general 2022-11-24 11:34:47 i only use my local files now
general 2022-11-24 11:38:13 ideas for stormworks?
general 2022-11-24 11:38:56 yeah i've been there before
general 2022-11-24 11:39:32 i've literally only listened to true
general 2022-11-24 11:39:37 that's it
general 2022-11-24 11:39:55 not familiar with any of their other music
general 2022-11-24 11:40:45 better than military marches
general 2022-11-24 11:41:56 demon face
general 2022-11-24 11:43:16 there was just a time when i was doing my useless garbage where i had to do stuff with backgrounds but just couldn't
general 2022-11-24 11:43:55 i eventually got it all done but had to take a break for a while
general 2022-11-24 11:44:11 kratos messi
general 2022-11-24 11:45:05 btw hru perion
general 2022-11-24 11:45:52 that's good to hear
general 2022-11-24 11:46:08 
general 2022-11-24 11:46:32 in 7 years this will be real
general 2022-11-24 11:49:09 last year (2003) an engine was developed that could go up to 8
general 2022-11-24 11:49:16 just 8
general 2022-11-24 11:50:09 yeah i'd push the button cause i can break it easy
general 2022-11-24 11:50:49 kiiro who is the character in your pfp
general 2022-11-24 11:51:35 i know basically nothing about anime
general 2022-11-24 11:53:47 this is what it's really about
general 2022-11-24 11:59:13 no lol
general 2022-11-24 11:59:48 it's alright though
general 2022-11-24 12:01:01 yeah that's better
general 2022-11-24 12:04:23 there was a time when i alternated between speaking with grammar and all lowercase like now, i don't want to go back to that time lmao
general 2022-11-24 12:05:50 i looked like an idiot alternating between the 2 so i just stuck with all lowercase
general 2022-11-24 12:06:44 i think you are
general 2022-11-24 12:10:12 asda living
general 2022-11-24 12:10:51 peak design
general 2022-11-24 12:10:57 you can't get any better
general 2022-11-24 12:31:42 very funny
general 2022-11-24 12:32:50 fuck yeah
general 2022-11-24 12:38:21 i don't even know who that is
general 2022-11-24 12:39:19 oh that guy
general 2022-11-24 12:39:34 i'm almost there
general 2022-11-24 12:45:43 2 minutes left
general 2022-11-24 13:17:48 wow good
general 2022-11-25 00:31:49 the forbidden screenshot
general 2022-11-25 00:31:52 also hi koy
general 2022-11-25 05:24:26 lmao he's gone
general 2022-11-25 05:29:27 don't go chips
general 2022-11-25 05:40:29 aren't you weepinhijay
general 2022-11-25 05:41:40 i've seen people say this stuff for a long time
general 2022-11-25 06:00:55 i don't really like boxness server
general 2022-11-25 06:01:31 it's not for me
general 2022-11-25 06:02:25 it's just not a great server to me
general 2022-11-25 06:02:32 that's why i never talk there
general 2022-11-25 06:03:25 boxness server is worse than here imo
general 2022-11-25 06:03:33 pcc isn't even that bad
general 2022-11-25 06:11:37 there's a lot worse than here
general 2022-11-25 06:11:41 like a lot
general 2022-11-25 06:44:28 hell yeah super castlevania 4
general 2022-11-25 06:44:43 i like the lower quality original sample more though
general 2022-11-25 07:03:12 hi perion
general 2022-11-25 07:03:19 hru
general 2022-11-25 07:09:47 that's good
general 2022-11-25 07:13:00 why is there an apple vs android discussion
general 2022-11-25 07:13:08 let people use what they want holy shit
general 2022-11-25 07:16:29 ^
general 2022-11-25 07:16:59 i don't care whether you use an android or an iphone, if you're happy with it then that's fine
general 2022-11-25 07:20:56 somebody decided to force it
general 2022-11-25 07:21:23 perion did absolutely nothing
general 2022-11-25 07:22:03 i mean a gameboy survived a bomb
general 2022-11-25 07:23:40 people can like what they want but folding phones are honestly stupid when you think about it
general 2022-11-25 07:24:38 the screen is literally bending in half constantly
general 2022-11-25 07:24:45 major failure point
general 2022-11-25 07:25:06 and you're paying more for inferior hardware
general 2022-11-25 07:25:59 objectively bad
general 2022-11-25 07:28:43 i'm big into audio so a headphone jack is important for me
general 2022-11-25 07:43:49 well this is something i didn't expect to see
general 2022-11-25 07:44:24 this has been undumped for ages
general 2022-11-25 07:51:39 i don't feel like digging through the rom myself but i wouldn't be surprised to see a page on tcrf tomorrow
general 2022-11-25 07:51:46 bound to be some stuff
general 2022-11-25 07:53:00 well if it's prototype roms then definitely preservation
general 2022-11-25 07:53:17 retail roms and iso files are a bit mixed
general 2022-11-25 07:54:12 if it's not currently being officially sold in any way then download it
general 2022-11-25 07:54:59 typical is not an old member
general 2022-11-25 07:55:01 far from it
general 2022-11-25 08:05:30 for some games you basically need to download them since there's no way they're ever being rereleased
general 2022-11-25 08:06:08 for instance outrun 2 because sega doesn't have the ferrari license anymore
general 2022-11-25 08:06:41 and that means the voice lines, models, attract sequence, and more need to be changed
general 2022-11-25 08:07:13 yeah exactly
general 2022-11-25 08:07:15 too much effort
general 2022-11-25 08:07:23 and are you really getting the same game anymore?
general 2022-11-25 08:08:09 teknoparrot is great for late 2000s arcade game emulation but there are clear issues
general 2022-11-25 08:08:41 yeah they are
general 2022-11-25 08:09:15 tried to get after burner climax running on rpcs3 and it would hang at the save screen
general 2022-11-25 08:09:52 i would've used the original lindbergh version on teknoparrot but it just outright refused to work
general 2022-11-25 08:10:39 supermodel is also crucial for playing model 3 games that will never be rereleased, which are the 2 most popular model 3 games
general 2022-11-25 08:10:48 scud race and both versions of daytona usa 2
general 2022-11-25 08:11:02 both have to do with licensing issues
general 2022-11-25 08:12:43 there's also the discussion to be made regarding ports and original releases
general 2022-11-25 08:13:03 you can technically still buy them but they aren't original
general 2022-11-25 08:15:19 after the nintendo leaks back in 2020 it's been debated whether original development assets should be released
general 2022-11-25 08:16:08 stuff like the sonic 2 art disks have been released before but nintendo had full workstation backups
general 2022-11-25 08:16:34 well "full" as in only 7/41 were read properly
general 2022-11-25 08:18:37 if they were done earlier then more could've been saved
general 2022-11-25 08:18:55 i'm convinced that they only did this for starfox 2's release on the snes classic
general 2022-11-25 08:20:29 speaking of which nintendo did something new for the release of starfox 2, they actually scanned design documents for the game
general 2022-11-25 10:21:54 i don’t even know what he’s done
general 2022-11-25 13:15:37 i said i wouldn't do anything with segapede and now i'm ripping tilemaps and looking at them
general 2022-11-25 13:15:57 tilemap studio doesn't exactly work well with megadrive tilemaps though
general 2022-11-25 13:16:30 no
general 2022-11-25 13:16:49 i'm just bored
general 2022-11-25 14:24:41 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUQOrsp7N7E
general 2022-11-25 14:24:45 ok wtf
general 2022-11-25 14:24:50 why does it just not embed
general 2022-11-25 14:25:22 that's weird
general 2022-11-26 09:00:53 i still have inventer added
general 2022-11-26 09:01:04 i should talk to him sometime
general 2022-11-26 09:04:46 glad to hear that
general 2022-11-28 11:30:37 honestly just let them do their thing
general 2022-11-28 11:30:52 doesn't bother anyone
bot-central 2022-11-28 11:31:16 !rank
general 2022-11-29 03:26:18 when did you come back
general 2022-11-29 03:27:34 fair enough
general 2022-11-29 09:24:32 yeah it's shit

general 2022-11-29 12:01:41 it's something
general 2022-12-01 04:34:14 hi chips
general 2022-12-01 05:18:12 lmao
general 2022-12-01 05:43:48 i didn’t get a spotify wrapped because i didn’t use spotify this year
general 2022-12-01 05:51:25 nothing wrong with ipad but this is just plain unhealthy
general 2022-12-01 05:51:33 seriously
general 2022-12-01 05:52:32 15 hours is more than half a day
general 2022-12-01 05:52:37 how
general 2022-12-01 05:52:54 that’s on average
general 2022-12-01 05:52:58 per day
general 2022-12-01 05:53:11 no
general 2022-12-01 05:53:15 he has 15
general 2022-12-01 07:23:09 shit, hope it’s not too bad
general 2022-12-01 07:24:32 yeah you can replace it yourself, but the problem is that you could break something
general 2022-12-01 07:26:34 hate apple all you want but samsung folding phones are stupid
general 2022-12-01 07:26:51 you’re paying for a gimmick
general 2022-12-01 07:27:00 and underpowered hardware for the price
general 2022-12-01 07:28:26 problem is you can’t really transfer data from an iphone to an android
general 2022-12-01 07:29:50 they don’t take your current situation into account
general 2022-12-01 07:30:06 obviously you just want to set it up quickly
general 2022-12-01 07:30:45 you don’t want to spend a lot of time finding alternatives to some apps and figuring out a new os
general 2022-12-01 07:32:10 i mean they do speed it up for planned obsolescence but it does happen still
general 2022-12-01 07:33:54 <@874912257128136734> when i was setting up my ipad pro i was just able to transfer everything as it was in like 10 minutes
general 2022-12-01 07:35:16 it’s why it’s good to stick with apple for your situation
general 2022-12-01 07:36:16 can you set up an android phone with everything that you had? sort of, but it takes time
general 2022-12-01 07:36:44 and you have to learn how to use android, which i’m not really a fan of
general 2022-12-01 07:37:15 i do have multiple android devices and couldn’t really get into using it
general 2022-12-01 07:38:33 and yes you can get apps on the play store which wouldn’t be allowed on the app store, but most of them aren’t really that useful to the average user
general 2022-12-01 07:39:17 emulation was a pull for me but i found it to be clunky and unintuitive on my android devices
general 2022-12-01 08:35:10 hi darkz
general 2022-12-01 08:35:18 hru
general 2022-12-01 08:35:35 well that’s alright
general 2022-12-01 08:41:16 what do you have against darkz

general 2022-12-01 22:28:33 perion is right in this case
general 2022-12-01 22:29:18 this is definitely getting too stupid
general 2022-12-01 22:32:49 but most servers aren't made up entirely of people from your own country
general 2022-12-01 22:32:53 that's the thing
general 2022-12-01 22:33:30 anyway this has gotten too stupid so i'll be off doing something else
general 2022-12-01 22:35:33 pcc hunger games has been overused

general 2022-12-02 00:28:11 i'm just absolutely sick of pcc subservers because they always end up similar
general 2022-12-02 00:28:26 i've seen a lot
general 2022-12-02 00:29:01 it'll eventually happen
general 2022-12-02 00:29:14 also just don't like the atmosphere of those servers
general 2022-12-02 00:29:23 it's why i left
general 2022-12-02 00:29:34 and don't plan on rejoining
general 2022-12-02 00:38:00 yeah he does have a team

general 2022-12-03 04:42:24 you should've known smh
general 2022-12-03 04:50:05 i wonder if it's possible to do something like msu1 with arcade games
general 2022-12-03 04:50:26 but instead of replacing the sequences outright it just replaces the pcm sample data
general 2022-12-03 04:51:04 i would absolutely love to hear power drift with the original pcm samples
general 2022-12-03 05:20:48 i see all

general 2022-12-04 07:27:52 super castlevania 4's ost sounds better with the original low quality samples
general 2022-12-04 07:28:02 it doesn't feel the same with the source samples
general 2022-12-04 07:30:34 i think i might've gotten the wrong sample
general 2022-12-04 07:30:52 either that or the sc55 has some u220 samples
general 2022-12-04 07:35:24 ok yeah definitely the same sample
general 2022-12-04 07:38:14 if i post any audio it's almost always using an spc2it conversion of the track
general 2022-12-04 07:38:42 which has some inaccuracies compared to the original spc data but it's the closest i'll get
general 2022-12-04 07:43:56 hi spell

general 2022-12-05 02:26:04 hi darkz
general 2022-12-05 02:32:07 such as it being a gacha game and it having all the mobile game bullshit

general 2022-12-08 06:19:36 the summer timeframe is for the full game
general 2022-12-08 06:24:04 hi darkz
general 2022-12-08 06:25:09 he makes the game have bugs on purpose
general 2022-12-08 06:25:35 scheme to get people to donate to improve development
general 2022-12-08 06:25:54 by faking bugs
general 2022-12-08 06:58:36 google translate

general 2022-12-08 12:00:19 i wasn't involved with any of this but how can you possibly prove your statement without evidence
general 2022-12-08 12:00:32 it's just an empty threat
general 2022-12-08 12:01:27 see how could we know if you're lying or not
general 2022-12-08 12:01:40 there's no proof
general 2022-12-08 12:01:57 well send it over then

general 2022-12-09 11:22:41 
general 2022-12-09 11:35:16 hi darkz
general 2022-12-09 11:35:27 no it is 2004 you should know this
general 2022-12-09 11:37:21 it is a bit sad but society needs to become modern by 2005 standards so this is the only way forward
general 2022-12-09 11:56:06 
general 2022-12-09 12:54:20 you have the wrong tech
general 2022-12-09 12:54:26 it's not techmaster

general 2022-12-12 02:12:58 i mean i wouldn't be surprised since rick hasn't shared anything for 2 months
general 2022-12-12 02:14:51 there will be more info shared about metroid prime 4 before pc2 releases
general 2022-12-12 02:17:46 you have to watch the other one
general 2022-12-12 02:18:55 turning a sphere outside in
general 2022-12-12 02:31:59 imo i don't like plane crazy builds looking too realistic, like yeah they look really impressive but i can't put it into words
general 2022-12-12 02:32:16 it's like how i don't want a hd remake of the original starfox games
general 2022-12-12 02:33:08 they look better at the original resolution
general 2022-12-12 02:36:24 someone's working on a hd remake of the original starfox and it just doesn't feel the same
general 2022-12-12 02:36:43 it's starfox but also not starfox at the same time
general 2022-12-12 02:40:12 the grind in babft is absurd
general 2022-12-12 02:40:38 it really represents what's wrong with gaming in recent times
general 2022-12-12 02:41:23 it's either force yourself to play to get the full experience, or pay money to get it quicker
general 2022-12-12 13:54:09 he can't click the book

general 2022-12-15 23:14:09 those don't exist
general 2022-12-15 23:14:48 i mean the sonic 1, 2, and cd remakes are on there but they're already existing games so it doesn't count
general 2022-12-15 23:20:03 nah the classic sonic games are good
general 2022-12-15 23:20:52 momentum-based platformer
general 2022-12-16 00:36:45 yeah it's literally just rgb
general 2022-12-16 00:39:57 snes asm supremacy
general 2022-12-16 06:56:55 i remember when pug was trying to get one of his roscale builds into hof
general 2022-12-16 07:05:31 i'm not really a fan of shaders because i like to keep games as stock as possible
general 2022-12-16 07:06:57 like i don't use those stupid pixel filters on emulators that make it look "smooth" because it looks like shit
general 2022-12-16 07:10:53 i mean it better be good if it's been in development for this long
general 2022-12-16 07:11:30 i have hope that it'll be good
general 2022-12-18 14:09:59 vip1 used to be
general 2022-12-18 14:10:04 a great place

general 2022-12-19 08:12:34 oh no
general 2022-12-19 08:16:33 but why
general 2022-12-19 08:30:55 yeah from pug
general 2022-12-19 08:31:34 honestly
general 2022-12-19 08:48:31 pretty sure they're normal picture files, but they still shouldn't make it sound dangerous
general 2022-12-19 14:16:30 a rare kind of person
general 2022-12-19 14:17:16 saul badman is pug
general 2022-12-19 14:17:17 i know that
general 2022-12-19 14:17:50 yeah he joined back for a bit and left
general 2022-12-19 14:19:53 yeah and i think he pinged you
general 2022-12-19 14:20:55 i asked him why and i didn't get an answer lmao
general 2022-12-19 14:21:09 i think he's still upset over battlebots
general 2022-12-19 14:22:22 superfx texture challenge
general 2022-12-19 14:22:28 15 colours, 32x32
general 2022-12-19 14:31:20 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1002355565881725108/1050686060641910834/starfox_ksp.gif
general 2022-12-19 15:00:36 just you
general 2022-12-20 07:53:14 when you say galaga is it that galaga
general 2022-12-20 07:53:25 the arcade game
general 2022-12-20 07:54:00 how is it a part of ace combat
general 2022-12-20 07:54:53 i assume starblade is also a part of it then
general 2022-12-20 07:55:01 developed by namco so
general 2022-12-20 07:55:43 even the unreleased sequel blue planet
general 2022-12-20 07:56:31 the fuck is this timeline lmao
general 2022-12-20 07:56:46 i would never imagine dig dug being linked to starblade and yet here it is
general 2022-12-20 07:58:41 the only starfox games i look at is the first 3
general 2022-12-20 07:58:46 anything else and i don't care
general 2022-12-20 08:04:30 i don't really care as much about sf64 but i group it together because it was the actual 2nd game to release
general 2022-12-20 08:04:47 starfox 2 was meant to come out in 1996 but got cancelled at the last second
general 2022-12-20 09:35:06 <@513966516958658561> why you red name
general 2022-12-20 10:06:12 orange
general 2022-12-20 10:06:17 like how it used to be
general 2022-12-20 10:06:26 but i don't really care you can do what you want
general 2022-12-20 10:06:38 yeah i know
general 2022-12-20 10:07:05 you can still be red i was just asking
general 2022-12-20 10:07:20 fair enough
general 2022-12-20 11:05:30 name 10 books
general 2022-12-20 11:56:29 hi fvl
general 2022-12-20 12:30:16 where are you getting this from
general 2022-12-20 12:30:29 bubbington isn't bad
general 2022-12-20 12:37:15 still don't know why symion hates bubbington
general 2022-12-22 02:45:34 the game
general 2022-12-22 04:13:39 isn't sr
general 2022-12-22 04:13:41 underage
general 2022-12-22 04:13:57 it's a bit
general 2022-12-22 04:14:01 not great
general 2022-12-22 04:15:49 still kind of a representation of an underage person
general 2022-12-22 04:16:03 i mean it's based on you
general 2022-12-22 04:16:40 weird as shit though
general 2022-12-22 04:22:55 unrelated but someone found a video with super mario world prototype footage but i immediately took interest in the pilotwings footage because it was different
general 2022-12-22 04:23:13 ended up loosely assigning a time frame to the build
general 2022-12-22 04:54:28 i don’t know what any of those mean
general 2022-12-22 22:21:07 
general 2022-12-22 22:24:56 don't get addicted
general 2022-12-22 22:25:08 alright good
general 2022-12-22 22:25:15 just make sure to watch yourself
general 2022-12-22 22:38:45 hate this program
general 2022-12-22 22:47:58 what's left of the pyramid of power
general 2022-12-22 22:48:16 there's some leftover tile data so i'll try to piece together something
general 2022-12-22 22:48:32 no guarantee it'll be accurate
general 2022-12-23 00:15:32 i've known someone like that, he wasn't really a great person
general 2022-12-23 00:32:49 if you look at starfox on wikipedia it says that starfox 2 is the latest game to release
general 2022-12-23 00:32:50 took them a while
general 2022-12-23 00:48:52 i think he's asking what that is in kg
general 2022-12-23 06:27:19 well that's pretty stupid
general 2022-12-23 06:28:03 complaining for no reason
general 2022-12-23 06:29:24 the starfox 2 engine
general 2022-12-23 06:30:21 literally a hacked together version of the starfox 1 engine
general 2022-12-23 06:30:34 the sf1 engine is quite robust
general 2022-12-23 06:30:54 starfox 2 throws a fit whenever you try to add more path commands
general 2022-12-23 06:31:16 what one are you thinking of?
general 2022-12-23 06:32:06 sounds great
general 2022-12-23 06:32:10 i think you should go for it
general 2022-12-23 06:33:51 2 player support was a huge part of it but it got scrapped towards the end
general 2022-12-23 06:34:11 infact it started out as a 2 player mod of the original starfox
general 2022-12-23 06:41:27 no clue
general 2022-12-23 06:46:41 that sc55 instrument set
general 2022-12-23 06:46:49 is it even sc55
general 2022-12-23 06:46:51 i think it is
general 2022-12-23 06:47:18 yeah the roland soundcanvas sc55
general 2022-12-23 06:48:51 stunt race fx has a lot of sc55 usage
general 2022-12-23 06:49:16 no clue
general 2022-12-23 06:55:48 2 months has passed
general 2022-12-23 06:56:04 idk why the training theme hasn't been done yet
general 2022-12-23 06:56:13 there's no issue with missing samples or anything
general 2022-12-23 06:56:52 i know that one is going to come next because i've been told that, not meteor
general 2022-12-23 06:57:30 or just send it to another server and copy video link
general 2022-12-23 07:01:54 not ending the sample sooner like the one in game
general 2022-12-23 22:38:44 pcc times is kind of dumb
general 2022-12-23 22:39:32 stupid newspaper thing for stuff that happens in the server
general 2022-12-23 22:39:37 i don't get it
general 2022-12-23 22:42:42 it really is pointless
general 2022-12-23 22:44:24 https://tcrf.net/images/7/7f/DSSonicSlots.gif
general 2022-12-23 22:44:34 hidden in the tcrf archives
general 2022-12-24 01:51:45 there's probably something to do that
general 2022-12-24 02:22:25 exactly
general 2022-12-24 03:44:55 gets mad at mig for something mire did
general 2022-12-24 03:44:58 smart
general 2022-12-24 03:46:21 yeah it’s a bit
general 2022-12-24 03:47:04 yeah i think so
general 2022-12-24 03:47:33 how you doing
general 2022-12-24 03:47:52 sucks
general 2022-12-24 04:00:53 honestly i don’t even bother with roblox anymore
general 2022-12-24 04:11:41 i remember that lmao
general 2022-12-24 04:29:48 who is this man
general 2022-12-24 04:33:26 what
general 2022-12-24 04:42:48 can i add fake places to it
general 2022-12-24 04:42:52 like the real google maps
general 2022-12-24 04:47:32 but it's to preserve it
general 2022-12-24 04:47:48 you're missing the entire point
general 2022-12-24 04:47:58 it's a snapshot of the current plane crazy map
general 2022-12-24 04:48:30 yes
general 2022-12-24 04:48:39 for preservation
general 2022-12-24 04:49:19 set up a whole github page for it and everything
general 2022-12-24 04:50:27 ^
general 2022-12-24 04:50:40 now i need to get a move on and move most of my gigaleak findings from the ssnc discord to tcrf
general 2022-12-24 04:50:52 but i don’t really like tcrf
general 2022-12-24 04:51:05 so it’ll take me a while
general 2022-12-24 13:37:22 people never read the readme
general 2022-12-24 13:37:33 i've seen it happen so many times
general 2022-12-24 13:41:11 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/849460872677687308/922697338751959120/christmas_1.mp4
general 2022-12-24 13:41:40 i should've made a remake of this but in hd
general 2022-12-24 13:41:46 missed opportunity
general 2022-12-24 13:42:01 i did it with the other version
general 2022-12-24 23:00:29 i recovered something
general 2022-12-24 23:00:33 that was deleted here
general 2022-12-24 23:00:48 yeah that image
general 2022-12-24 23:11:50 yeah it's all just weird shit
general 2022-12-24 23:16:20 genshin has talented people working on the game but it has shitty mobile game mechanics
general 2022-12-24 23:19:11 i mean gamedev isn't easy
general 2022-12-24 23:19:12 at all
general 2022-12-24 23:25:13 my collection grows
general 2022-12-24 23:25:20 i've also got the korg m1
general 2022-12-25 01:38:02 somehow worse than comedi
general 2022-12-25 02:01:53 already lost
general 2022-12-25 02:01:56 it's different
general 2022-12-25 02:02:01 idk where to go
general 2022-12-25 02:02:49 link to the past hack
general 2022-12-25 02:02:58 adds some prototype stuff
general 2022-12-25 02:03:52 kakariko village is just 4 houses
general 2022-12-25 02:05:27 like this is the final one
general 2022-12-25 06:14:50 hi rage
general 2022-12-25 08:03:27 yeah don't speak about it
general 2022-12-26 00:25:23 can't
general 2022-12-26 01:08:58 pcc times is kind of useless
general 2022-12-26 01:09:02 and dumb
general 2022-12-26 01:13:58 who would go read this when you can just ask someone about what happened
general 2022-12-26 02:14:17 alpha is like really early
general 2022-12-26 02:14:26 beta is early but not like alpha
general 2022-12-26 02:14:28 easy
general 2022-12-26 02:14:56 and then you just use "prototype" when you don't know
general 2022-12-26 05:44:46 last week of 2004
general 2022-12-26 05:44:50 sad
general 2022-12-26 05:45:09 society will never be the same

general 2022-12-27 04:18:04 i love how my mouse just randomly does middle click when scrolling now
general 2022-12-27 11:40:48 isn't that a silicon graphics system
general 2022-12-27 11:41:08 they made cutting edge workstations back in the 90s
general 2022-12-27 12:12:15 true
general 2022-12-28 01:09:40 what’s the source
general 2022-12-28 01:10:17 haven’t heard about it
general 2022-12-28 01:10:52 oh shit i just saw it
general 2022-12-28 01:10:56 that’s crazy
general 2022-12-28 01:12:16 i’ve never even played bloxburg
general 2022-12-28 05:51:55 found a tool that lets me view the mortal kombat 2 source graphics, doesn't work on narc because it uses an earlier version of the format
general 2022-12-28 05:53:49 oh shit i can export it as a targa image
general 2022-12-28 05:53:56 not the .vda files though
general 2022-12-28 05:59:50 real targa file
general 2022-12-28 06:00:25 i don't work with 3d
general 2022-12-28 06:00:33 well not too much
general 2022-12-28 06:00:46 i have converted models from link to the past though
general 2022-12-28 12:02:49 here's a question
general 2022-12-28 12:03:04 would you listen to a remastered version of a song or the original release
general 2022-12-28 12:03:18 hell yeah
general 2022-12-28 12:05:23 or if the band rereleases the track (from the original master recordings), would you listen to that instead of the original pressing
general 2022-12-28 12:08:12 bit mixed for me, i really like getting the most out of the original tracks though
general 2022-12-28 12:10:58 i kind of want official moving shadow merch but the best one is sold out
general 2022-12-31 05:34:38 there is way worse out there
general 2022-12-31 14:57:01 
general 2022-12-31 15:04:36 the inevitable
general 2023-01-01 13:45:44 you were here like ages ago
general 2023-01-02 05:49:42 exactly
general 2023-01-02 05:51:15 i've interacted with a community that has a lot of furries and i have to say they're mostly all fine
general 2023-01-02 05:52:14 yeah i've mostly seen chill furries
general 2023-01-02 05:52:23 what's the issue
general 2023-01-02 05:52:33 can't like a game series?
general 2023-01-02 05:52:36 alright then
general 2023-01-02 10:45:47 the goods
general 2023-01-02 10:46:14 yeah they're the goods
general 2023-01-02 11:07:44 maybe in late 2005 but not now
general 2023-01-03 00:25:48 getting mad about someone doing something that he did before
general 2023-01-03 10:11:37 absolutely disgusting
general 2023-01-03 10:12:05 nah i’m fine
general 2023-01-03 10:12:29 i don’t watch him or anything but have heard of him
general 2023-01-03 10:13:53 good idea to not bypass
general 2023-01-03 10:14:00 but yeah
general 2023-01-04 08:13:24 oh seyo you're back here
general 2023-01-04 08:13:28 just realised

general 2023-01-04 08:14:16 well
general 2023-01-04 08:14:21 all over the place
general 2023-01-04 09:13:22 far from french
general 2023-01-04 09:13:42 true
general 2023-01-04 09:14:46 of course sr has a better one he grinds the game all the time
general 2023-01-04 09:15:20 most of us here have quit pc anyway
general 2023-01-04 09:17:31 this server is nothing
general 2023-01-04 09:17:38 there is way worse
general 2023-01-04 09:17:43 oh yeah i remember that lol
general 2023-01-04 09:17:48 over a java program
general 2023-01-04 09:18:37 i forgot who ritualfishy was
general 2023-01-04 09:22:51 that timeline feels so wrong lmao
general 2023-01-04 09:23:14 dig dug and starblade somehow linked
general 2023-01-04 09:24:45 open original image
general 2023-01-04 09:52:34 it's you
general 2023-01-04 12:43:11 hi spell
general 2023-01-04 12:43:35 how've you been
general 2023-01-05 03:03:39 was it really
general 2023-01-06 00:57:30 not really
general 2023-01-06 00:57:48 we talked about dev stuff occasionally
general 2023-01-06 01:32:45 super mario world isn't that great
general 2023-01-06 01:32:59 it's just alright
general 2023-01-06 01:33:36 i mean on yoshi's sign yeah
general 2023-01-06 01:34:13 smw doesn't really utilise the potential of the snes
general 2023-01-06 01:34:37 only the select few mode 7 parts pop into my head but that's about it
general 2023-01-06 01:34:52 oh wow lol
general 2023-01-06 01:35:33 but smw doesn't really look as good as sonic 1, and the snes has better colour potential
general 2023-01-06 12:30:50 the car in narc is literally just an edited version of a picture of a toy car
general 2023-01-06 12:31:35 the image of the car on the attract screen is heavily edited to add guns and the license plate
general 2023-01-06 12:32:25 alright not sharing stuff here
general 2023-01-07 08:15:42 the francium has collapsed

general 2023-01-07 10:09:03 already a warn lmao
general 2023-01-07 10:09:25 you can’t say our word here sadly
general 2023-01-07 10:09:42 i never use it anyway so doesn’t affect me
general 2023-01-07 12:11:15 that is literally the same spot
general 2023-01-07 12:11:36 you can see the same background elements
general 2023-01-08 04:20:58 he just have to leave
general 2023-01-08 08:07:57 so true
general 2023-01-08 11:58:29 takin over
general 2023-01-08 12:27:34 yeah i don't really see the point of such a specific rank
general 2023-01-08 12:28:05 it's like making a rank for vehicles which have 3 wheels
general 2023-01-08 12:28:09 there's no point
general 2023-01-08 12:29:04 but the issue is that it's so specific
general 2023-01-08 12:29:25 aero engineer is very broad
general 2023-01-08 12:30:19 same as terrain, robotics, etc.
the-dump 2023-01-08 12:33:24 i need a place to upload this shit sorry
the-dump 2023-01-08 12:33:55 and it doesn't work
the-dump 2023-01-08 12:33:56 oh well
general 2023-01-08 12:47:04 that's not as bad as pug
general 2023-01-08 12:47:19 offered quaileer like 1000 robux for his tank turret
general 2023-01-08 12:47:30 (true story)
general 2023-01-08 12:48:04 that's what he should've done
general 2023-01-08 12:51:42 could've made easy 1000 robux
general 2023-01-08 12:52:20 then again it's also a pretty shitty thing to do
general 2023-01-08 14:44:40 rare roborail1 sighting
general 2023-01-08 14:45:49 you don't understand
general 2023-01-08 14:46:31 i don't know
general 2023-01-08 14:46:42 i should add corneria to google maps
general 2023-01-08 14:48:13 i was going to say can't wait for the rare n0tnevada sighting then i realised
general 2023-01-08 14:57:22 <@720891502108344360> it's something at least

general 2023-01-08 15:15:50 ok works
general 2023-01-08 15:17:32 <@832352865804484628> if you were wondering where i've been i've just been posting random stuff in cheese kingdom
general 2023-01-08 15:17:55 shit
general 2023-01-08 15:17:59 i thought nobody looked
general 2023-01-08 15:21:45 i just sort of want to get stuff out there
general 2023-01-08 15:22:00 sending it is good enough for me
general 2023-01-08 15:29:12 like i could properly document stuff but i'm too worried about making it sound proper rather than the content
general 2023-01-08 15:29:25 so i just chuck things out there
general 2023-01-08 15:29:46 i did try a year ago but got frustrated so i gave up
general 2023-01-08 15:30:22 you don't know the jaycar lore
general 2023-01-09 11:35:24 too early
general 2023-01-09 11:42:36 i think it depends on the gpu
general 2023-01-09 11:42:44 what was yours again i forgot
general 2023-01-09 12:15:35 there's a point in pc where things look really out of place due to the accuracy
general 2023-01-09 12:23:00 yeah it just sort of looks
general 2023-01-09 12:23:01 wrong
general 2023-01-09 12:26:09 when did that happen
general 2023-01-09 12:39:51 hi tinon
general 2023-01-09 12:40:35 don't think so no
general 2023-01-09 12:41:05 was going to say yousuf retired but realised you probably already knew
general 2023-01-09 12:42:20 haven't really caught up with him after he left pcc
general 2023-01-09 12:42:32 so that's great to know
general 2023-01-09 12:44:22 nice
general 2023-01-09 12:44:31 yeah it's actually worse
general 2023-01-09 12:45:05 like every 3rd conversation is either about furries or femboys
general 2023-01-09 12:45:45 surprisingly they haven't given up yet
general 2023-01-09 12:45:55 well only like 2 of them do anything
general 2023-01-09 12:46:18 i don't even know what fuzzy's done
general 2023-01-09 12:47:10 be patient
general 2023-01-09 12:47:36 really is the cycle
general 2023-01-09 12:48:33 yeah
general 2023-01-09 12:49:52 roblox dev
general 2023-01-09 12:49:57 the horror
general 2023-01-09 12:51:22 truly is a wild place
general 2023-01-09 12:51:48 the stupid midway dcs sound system is such bullshit once you realise it's just regular pcm
general 2023-01-09 12:51:51 but just compressed
general 2023-01-09 12:53:17 just happens here
general 2023-01-09 12:53:53 no that's just queensland
general 2023-01-09 12:55:40 oh yeah forgot you work at the museum
general 2023-01-09 12:56:13 this is really what dcs is
general 2023-01-09 12:56:57 really great sample rate of 31250hz
general 2023-01-09 12:57:13 i mean better than what you hear from the sound board
general 2023-01-09 13:21:56 <@573970670854340628> didn't mire also send you questionable stuff
general 2023-01-09 13:22:13 oh god
general 2023-01-09 13:25:19 narc was such a controversial game that i would be warned if i sent many things featured in it
general 2023-01-09 13:25:59 mortal kombat 2 maybe
general 2023-01-09 13:26:52 depends on the tolerance of digitised graphics violence here
general 2023-01-09 13:26:59 but narc definitely yes
general 2023-01-09 13:29:39 i assume it was what tech received too
general 2023-01-09 13:29:53 yeah it's been like that for ages
general 2023-01-09 13:30:38 he resigned
general 2023-01-09 13:31:17 no he's still here
general 2023-01-09 13:31:46 see i am right
general 2023-01-09 13:31:59 every 3rd conversation is either about furries or femboys
general 2023-01-09 13:33:25 fucking hell
general 2023-01-09 13:33:29 this is still going on
general 2023-01-09 13:34:08 nightmare it's her thigh pics isn't it
general 2023-01-09 13:34:24 because that's what tech got sent
general 2023-01-09 13:34:53 if it was warnable lmao
general 2023-01-09 13:35:27 well yeah mire is trans
general 2023-01-09 13:41:34 i mean i had to give the answer straight up or else the begging would still continue
general 2023-01-09 13:42:20 it's not about me
general 2023-01-09 13:42:37 it's so the conversation isn't just about femboy pics
general 2023-01-09 13:42:46 and begging to know about them
general 2023-01-09 13:44:28 mortal kombat 2 when bypassing the dcs compression from the henry dos tool
general 2023-01-09 13:44:32 it's not the same
general 2023-01-09 13:47:41 never been banned here
general 2023-01-09 13:47:48 you honestly have to try
general 2023-01-09 13:51:03 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/967631500805816330/1059011811329970186/jaycargif.gif
general 2023-01-09 13:51:27 only real ones know of jaycar
general 2023-01-09 13:51:59 it is the place of all time
general 2023-01-09 14:01:20 mobile gaming
general 2023-01-09 14:01:25 peak of garbage
general 2023-01-09 14:01:41 that's rare

general 2023-01-09 14:05:08 sort of been like that for a while but worse now
general 2023-01-09 14:07:40 at least it's better for you now
general 2023-01-09 14:11:34 no this is like
general 2023-01-09 14:11:36 bad

general 2023-01-09 14:40:08 i thought we were in the same timezone
general 2023-01-09 14:40:21 what time is it rn for you
general 2023-01-09 14:40:48 it’s like 1:40 for me
general 2023-01-09 15:29:00 why do people just
general 2023-01-09 15:29:09 become obsessed with this
general 2023-01-09 15:29:28 it really doesn't matter
general 2023-01-09 15:29:34 just a person
general 2023-01-10 02:14:12 finally did it legit
general 2023-01-10 02:14:30 it's a really difficult button code which you have to do really quickly
general 2023-01-10 06:03:42 do it for the vine
general 2023-01-10 08:49:47 you need to buy the expansion for more numbers
general 2023-01-10 09:20:04 fuck yeah
general 2023-01-10 09:20:15 but for me i always go for flac
general 2023-01-11 10:23:45 how do you know
general 2023-01-11 10:33:45 honestly yeah
general 2023-01-11 11:58:14 glaggleland
general 2023-01-11 12:03:36 ladiesman217
general 2023-01-11 12:04:20 yeah mostly, you can buy new stuff on ebay as well
general 2023-01-11 14:20:36 sillybean
general 2023-01-11 14:21:25 vira how've you been, haven't seen you in a while
general 2023-01-11 14:28:43 well that's alright
general 2023-01-12 02:59:06 revx could work as a super scaler game but only issues would be the colours (4096 for most things post z unit) and you would have to redo every track for spcm
general 2023-01-12 02:59:22 hi koy
general 2023-01-12 02:59:24 hru?
general 2023-01-12 03:00:10 that's great, shame you're still sick though
general 2023-01-12 03:00:16 i've been improving
general 2023-01-12 03:00:57 like still not how i used to be but better at least
general 2023-01-12 03:12:58 hi seyo
general 2023-01-12 03:18:23 i'm getting better
general 2023-01-12 03:18:26 wbu
general 2023-01-12 03:32:01 what a story
general 2023-01-12 12:51:03 roblox is just like that, for sky on fire it's an intentional choice
general 2023-01-12 12:51:48 a visual style, it's the reason why there's so many games which use sprites despite all the technology we have now
general 2023-01-12 12:54:05 the choice doesn't always have to do with hardware
general 2023-01-12 12:54:17 it could just fit the game better
general 2023-01-12 12:55:26 well sort of, it's more complex but it still has that style
general 2023-01-12 12:56:01 ex-zodiac has the low poly look of the original starfox but it's more like a model 2 game with the mapped textures
general 2023-01-12 14:22:22 ^
general 2023-01-13 00:49:37 very funny
general 2023-01-13 02:34:41 stay on windows 10 don't go to 11
general 2023-01-13 02:34:44 it's not worth it
general 2023-01-13 02:34:52 piece of shit os
general 2023-01-13 02:35:10 there's more to it
general 2023-01-13 02:35:29 you can't use 7zip without going into another right click menu
general 2023-01-13 02:35:46 you can't rename files without going into that menu too
general 2023-01-13 02:35:49 or cut
general 2023-01-13 02:35:52 or copy
general 2023-01-13 02:36:20 of course key commands work but you can't do it with right click without it being needlessly annoying
general 2023-01-13 02:48:41 windows 10 is alright, it's 11 that's the issue
general 2023-01-13 02:54:21 so true
general 2023-01-13 02:56:35 they make no sense
general 2023-01-13 02:56:38 i don't get it
general 2023-01-13 02:57:08 nobody knows what goes on there
general 2023-01-13 02:58:16 https://tenor.com/view/jixaw-xd-toss-off-approach-the-bus-insurance-iamgoingtosellthisman-gif-25852348

general 2023-01-13 03:14:01 no it literally is a pool
general 2023-01-13 03:14:16 only sometimes the water goes down
general 2023-01-13 03:14:24 <@322970944303923200> can you confirm
general 2023-01-13 03:16:04 shame

general 2023-01-15 12:05:39 to put that into perspective the nes was 20 years old when the wii was released
general 2023-01-15 12:05:45 what model
general 2023-01-15 12:06:01 original one with gamecube backwards compatibility or the later model
general 2023-01-15 12:06:49 aka the regular white one from release or the later one which came in multiple colours
general 2023-01-15 12:07:59 i've never sold any of my hardware or games

general 2023-01-16 05:15:48 hi
general 2023-01-16 05:16:36 idk
general 2023-01-16 05:17:02 i need to find one of those guitar presets instead of the stupid midi chords
general 2023-01-16 06:39:06 wtf is this internal argonaut tool shit
general 2023-01-16 06:39:35 sitting here confused because i've seen that adding 1 to numchrs adds 20 bytes
general 2023-01-16 06:40:00 but if i count each row of 20 bytes the numbers don't match
general 2023-01-16 06:43:01 nvm i'm just a dumbass i forgot i was working with hex
general 2023-01-16 06:43:18 it all makes sense

general 2023-01-16 11:26:55 yeah there's a low chance this isn't nox
general 2023-01-16 11:27:04 same behaviour
general 2023-01-16 11:31:35 so is layton rodusk or
general 2023-01-16 11:31:45 ah okay

the-dump 2023-01-16 11:44:22 i mean

the-dump 2023-01-16 11:44:47 so i don't bother
the-dump 2023-01-16 11:45:15 with changing anything

general 2023-01-16 12:29:51 including revx
general 2023-01-16 12:30:17 hi tinon
general 2023-01-16 12:30:44 i don't even know what that is
general 2023-01-16 12:40:21 smoking game
general 2023-01-16 12:40:46 true
general 2023-01-16 12:57:24 i just tried to search narc to get into gimp wtf lmao
general 2023-01-16 12:57:25 tired
general 2023-01-16 13:30:42 <@370594904268734464> you heard about the mortal kombat 2 source code yeah
general 2023-01-16 13:45:21 minster beach
general 2023-01-16 13:46:13 tons of unused powerups for revolution x
general 2023-01-16 13:46:16 shame
general 2023-01-16 13:46:24 would've been more interesting with them
general 2023-01-17 00:36:56 i mean genshin has some talent behind it but it's trapped behind shitty mobile game mechanics
general 2023-01-17 00:38:30 yeah true, but the work put into other parts of the game could've been used elsewhere
general 2023-01-17 00:39:27 this is what i hate about gaming now, it's all just lootboxes, gacha, and whatever else is similar
general 2023-01-17 00:40:13 yeah you get some good ones but that stuff is becoming more and more apparent
general 2023-01-17 00:41:33 yeah that was a bit much i agree, but it's undeniable that all that stuff is more prominent than how things were just a decade ago
general 2023-01-17 01:21:58 i don't get it
general 2023-01-17 01:28:02 don't question him he always does that
general 2023-01-17 01:45:06 that was last year
general 2023-01-17 02:12:25 something doesn't look right here
general 2023-01-17 02:33:51 mk2 too violent for here
general 2023-01-17 02:34:03 still going after almost 30 years
general 2023-01-17 02:40:07 the resolution of all time
general 2023-01-17 02:43:32 holy shit i can actually see higher quality pics of dragonfly this was needed ages ago
general 2023-01-17 02:45:40 picture we've had for years vs the new scan
general 2023-01-17 02:45:45 we can actually see shit now
general 2023-01-17 02:46:14 prototype of pilotwings
general 2023-01-17 02:46:16 the snes game
general 2023-01-17 03:18:17 i've got it
general 2023-01-17 04:38:17 natsume surprisingly uses tons of samples between games so just by looking at the spreadsheet it wasn't that hard to get the guitar
general 2023-01-17 04:38:56 also i think the spreadsheet has a mistake cause the bass is clearly the sdk one, not the u220 one
general 2023-01-17 05:24:27 we know you're nox already
general 2023-01-17 05:24:35 you don't need to say it every time
general 2023-01-17 05:24:46 yeah tech it really is interesting
general 2023-01-17 05:25:00 did you know that account being used right now is a throwaway

general 2023-01-17 10:29:45 hi
general 2023-01-17 12:05:40 having the issue where the electric tom is overpowering every other sample in wild guns
general 2023-01-17 12:09:28 overdrive guitar definitely is the sc55 one but looks to have effects applied to it
general 2023-01-17 12:13:48 his average video
general 2023-01-17 12:19:05 the stuff
general 2023-01-17 12:21:08 ohio memes are literally the least funny thing i've seen in a while
general 2023-01-17 12:21:18 i don't get it
general 2023-01-17 12:21:47 it's just random shit
general 2023-01-17 12:22:55 yeah true
general 2023-01-17 12:23:57 there's still so much shit that hasn't been found for wild guns
general 2023-01-17 12:24:29 the only instrument sample outside of some drum samples and the sdk bass which has been found is the guitar
general 2023-01-17 12:25:33 no brass, no orch stab (is that what you even call it?), no acoustic guitar samples, no whistle, and none of the things exclusive to the credits theme
general 2023-01-17 12:26:08 it's quite limiting outside of the tracks which mainly use the overdrive guitar
general 2023-01-17 12:59:33 doing the job

general 2023-01-18 03:52:01 i've never built any furniture from ikea specifically so i have no idea
general 2023-01-18 05:05:23 we all know the mechanism is the best ride there
general 2023-01-18 05:22:51 is it the jungle i'm thinking of
general 2023-01-18 05:35:02 related to breakbeat yeah

general 2023-01-18 05:36:28 man you get a lot of good shit outside of what's on spotify
general 2023-01-18 05:37:28 breakcore is different
general 2023-01-18 05:37:48 i'm into the atmospheric stuff from that time period
general 2023-01-18 05:37:55 like the releases on creative source
general 2023-01-18 05:38:22 (no i did not discover this stuff from intense - only you)
general 2023-01-18 05:38:43 friend showed me this stuff back in 2021
general 2023-01-18 05:39:40 recently i've been getting into the stuff released under moving shadow
general 2023-01-18 05:41:39 the first thing i listened to was mouly's studio set
general 2023-01-18 05:42:27 aka cast adrift 1995
general 2023-01-18 05:43:32 <@761354294859005962> you should check out herbalarchive on yt
general 2023-01-18 05:46:18 yeah just a bunch of great tracks
general 2023-01-18 05:46:41 i think most people into this stuff know about the channel ambiance
general 2023-01-18 05:47:59 it's not even morning for him
general 2023-01-18 05:51:14 only you is a really good track but then intense also released the sax lick
general 2023-01-18 09:44:33 best part is that tech saw him say it once and didn’t do shit lmao
general 2023-01-18 09:45:01 true
general 2023-01-18 09:45:04 good idea
general 2023-01-18 12:08:37 17th release of the same game
general 2023-01-18 12:08:48 totally
general 2023-01-18 12:09:25 i don't even know the point where fifa just became the same game over and over again - in terms of code that is
general 2023-01-18 12:09:45 of course there's some differences but the same core game is the same
general 2023-01-18 12:09:54 i don't play cod so idk
general 2023-01-18 12:29:29 wait when was that?

general 2023-01-18 13:25:06 do you remember the stuff with the nsfw server there
general 2023-01-18 13:25:38 about how gamer thailand's server had age roles and they were letting 12 year olds into the nsfw channel
general 2023-01-18 13:25:55 yeah that's what i was talking about
general 2023-01-18 13:26:00 yeah i spoke with him
general 2023-01-18 13:27:10 lean land was an experience

general 2023-01-18 13:34:58 whole game got ruined by a freemodel of a turntable
general 2023-01-18 13:35:16 holy shit
general 2023-01-18 13:35:34 what happened to your laptop back then
general 2023-01-18 13:36:37 idk i heard it was because of the usage of lean
general 2023-01-18 13:36:53 i have no clue

general 2023-01-18 13:38:04 ah ok
general 2023-01-18 13:38:25 my hinge is literally falling apart one day the glass screen is going to shatter
general 2023-01-18 13:38:40 will be a funny day
general 2023-01-18 13:39:20 fuck i know i posted some here before when the game was active i might go find them
general 2023-01-18 13:39:29 what's the date on those screenshots?

general 2023-01-18 13:47:11 i can't find any lean land screenshots sadly
general 2023-01-18 13:47:20 or maybe i'm not looking late enough
general 2023-01-18 13:47:45 i have videos of
general 2023-01-18 13:47:49 work in pizza place
general 2023-01-18 13:48:00 kitchen bombing
general 2023-01-18 13:48:56 2003
general 2023-01-18 13:48:59 real footage
general 2023-01-18 13:54:19 the quid update <@720891502108344360>
general 2023-01-18 13:54:24 comedi before he uh
general 2023-01-18 13:54:28 did
general 2023-01-18 13:54:31 stuff
general 2023-01-18 13:54:55 imagine
general 2023-01-18 13:55:03 terrible
general 2023-01-18 13:55:14 quid update will never happen again
general 2023-01-18 13:55:22 once in a lifetime
general 2023-01-18 13:55:43 
general 2023-01-18 13:56:54 
general 2023-01-18 13:57:17 the time ever
general 2023-01-18 13:57:32 no
general 2023-01-18 13:58:20 yeah tech knows brendon is nox but did nothing
general 2023-01-18 13:58:26 like saw him say it and all
general 2023-01-18 13:59:00 he's just
general 2023-01-18 13:59:02 a guy
general 2023-01-18 14:00:05 i still have no idea what happened with jackie
general 2023-01-18 14:00:29 he asked me for the airwolf arcade game ages ago and i gave it
general 2023-01-18 14:00:36 wtf
general 2023-01-18 14:00:46 <@451025784228806656> you know about this or?
general 2023-01-18 14:00:54 oh i assume he knows then
general 2023-01-18 14:01:00 sorry
general 2023-01-18 14:01:27 so funny that it's in comedi's server
general 2023-01-18 14:03:17 the weird period when creations chat was creations feedback
general 2023-01-18 14:04:04 what's 2021 i only know 2003
general 2023-01-18 14:04:31 impossible
general 2023-01-18 14:04:43 2005 became real just 19 days ago
general 2023-01-18 14:04:59 we are still transitioning into the new 2005 society
general 2023-01-18 14:06:07 the fine china
general 2023-01-18 14:07:40 is it one stored on your computer or a link
general 2023-01-18 14:07:55 wtf
general 2023-01-18 14:08:01 never heard of that happening
general 2023-01-18 14:08:43 alr cya
general 2023-01-18 14:13:49 where will your location be on google maps you can't use the one i added before
general 2023-01-18 14:16:12 thanks i will add it
general 2023-01-18 14:16:34 wait fuck i can't add places in ukraine
general 2023-01-18 14:17:26 yeah i know but i can't suggest edits or anything
general 2023-01-18 14:19:34 no i literally can't add stuff in ukraine at all
general 2023-01-18 14:23:18 alright it's pending
general 2023-01-18 14:40:50 bad experience
general 2023-01-18 14:41:04 most furries i've interacted with are chill
general 2023-01-18 14:41:41 i'm talking about my experiences
general 2023-01-18 14:42:04 i'm literally in a starfox server
general 2023-01-18 14:43:01 but not a usual starfox server - one dedicated to the original 3 games
general 2023-01-18 14:43:39 so we don't have the people who simp on krystal
general 2023-01-18 14:55:39 what
general 2023-01-18 14:55:53 no not the car
general 2023-01-18 15:31:45 https://youtu.be/Ynv58lvsnRI <@761354294859005962>
general 2023-01-19 02:10:50 not sure, hope they get better though, it’s rough
general 2023-01-19 02:14:52 i thought everyone knew that
general 2023-01-19 02:19:54 most of these complaints are just the sign of a game early in development
general 2023-01-19 02:20:51 yeah maybe it should've been released later on so these features could be added
general 2023-01-19 02:22:19 i mean you kind of have to ask yourself "is this polished enough" when putting something out there, even for a rev1 release
general 2023-01-19 02:23:06 tech when are you going to ban nox's alt
general 2023-01-19 02:23:20 wait really
general 2023-01-19 02:23:36 oh yeah he is lmao
general 2023-01-19 02:31:52 honestly getting a gaming pc for roblox is kind of a waste
general 2023-01-19 02:31:59 (ragetheking)
general 2023-01-19 02:33:57 yeah that's what i was saying
general 2023-01-19 02:34:33 some emulators can be resource intensive too
general 2023-01-19 02:37:38 so true
general 2023-01-19 02:37:53 i kind of lost interest in new releases
general 2023-01-19 02:38:35 unless it's something that looks appealing to me like ex-zodiac
general 2023-01-19 02:39:01 beat all current 6 stages ages ago and i still occasionally hop on to play
general 2023-01-19 02:40:44 i barely use steam in general
general 2023-01-19 02:48:56 that's a bit weird
general 2023-01-19 02:49:09 thought that would be grouped with other socials
general 2023-01-19 02:49:44 if twitter's blocked then tiktok and snapchat being unblocked is utter bullshit
general 2023-01-19 02:51:07 yeah but they're grouped with other social apps, well not tiktok really since that's just a video sharing site, but snapchat yes
general 2023-01-19 02:51:47 i mean it does reduce attention span so yeah
general 2023-01-19 02:52:29 it's a game do they really think they will let you
general 2023-01-19 02:53:06 yeah that actually is a bit weird now thinking about it
general 2023-01-19 02:53:50 damn can't wait for it to be finished in like 2 hours
general 2023-01-19 02:54:22 (this is for high quality scans of 1 magazine issue)
general 2023-01-19 02:54:42 that's... really inconsistent
general 2023-01-19 07:08:52 so today i learnt that the artists for many midway arcade games don’t have their art
general 2023-01-19 07:09:02 fun
general 2023-01-19 07:09:33 some of it is preserved with the source code but there’s bound to be some lost stuff
general 2023-01-19 11:05:03 wait what
general 2023-01-19 11:05:13 how are you in the gamer thailand server
general 2023-01-19 11:13:18 sillybean
general 2023-01-19 11:14:13 no
general 2023-01-19 11:19:00 ok sorry
general 2023-01-19 11:42:28 impossible we are in 2005
general 2023-01-19 11:45:30 what
general 2023-01-19 11:45:32 how
general 2023-01-19 11:45:55 i have been keeping track since 2003
general 2023-01-19 13:37:48 cad's cool though
general 2023-01-19 14:29:43 contact a mod
general 2023-01-19 14:38:40 inventor has appealed pass the message along to them
general 2023-01-19 14:39:00 inventerlender
general 2023-01-19 14:39:15 yeah
general 2023-01-19 14:39:35 like the tag or discord id
general 2023-01-19 14:39:43 925391831603232800
general 2023-01-19 14:40:31 falded's appeal got accepted you never know
general 2023-01-19 14:41:34 it really is
general 2023-01-19 15:00:33 this is the good one
general 2023-01-19 15:01:43 the best challenges
general 2023-01-19 15:01:49 high stakes
general 2023-01-20 03:25:00 good idea
general 2023-01-20 09:04:01 this is truly a moment
general 2023-01-20 16:00:03 back to wawa cat
general 2023-01-20 16:00:04 wow
general 2023-01-20 16:09:15 revX source code is actually a lost rev 2 build lol
general 2023-01-20 16:09:24 would be worth it to get it built
general 2023-01-20 16:09:54 i think someone already tried in the midway source server but some of the gfx were fucked up
general 2023-01-20 16:11:53 also kind of need to get it to build to look at the earlier bus segment cause there's no gsp board connectivity on dosbox
general 2023-01-20 16:15:12 nice
general 2023-01-20 16:15:41 it’s like 3am i should probably sleep
general 2023-01-20 16:17:08 wdym sus
general 2023-01-20 16:17:15 it’s a flac
general 2023-01-20 16:17:22 yeah
general 2023-01-20 16:18:21 the one cd i want is the revolution x promo soundtrack since there’s no rips of it online
general 2023-01-20 16:18:26 or decent scans
general 2023-01-20 16:19:45 i’m willing to even go and try to figure out how to decompress the dcs audio from the sound roms just so we don’t have to rely on that one rip of it posted to youtube
general 2023-01-20 16:20:33 the uncompressed dcs audio is 16bit mono pcm at 31250hz
general 2023-01-20 16:21:14 in mortal kombat 2’s case, it was recorded on a dat tape and that tape was backed up
general 2023-01-20 16:23:13 dcs literally just stands for digital compression system
general 2023-01-20 16:23:18 that’s it
general 2023-01-20 16:24:58 i mean at least it's higher quality than what the cabinet puts out
general 2023-01-20 16:26:01 yeah for mk2 all the raw sound files were left there
general 2023-01-20 16:26:06 that's how i have these
general 2023-01-20 16:29:20 rare tsunami sighting
general 2023-01-20 16:31:17 no i don't think so
general 2023-01-20 16:31:34 that includes the music too
general 2023-01-20 16:31:55 which were all segmented and had to be manually arranged
general 2023-01-20 16:34:31 bitrate for mk2 pcm is 500kbps
general 2023-01-20 16:36:12 
general 2023-01-20 16:37:55 
general 2023-01-20 16:39:08 this is the most we've ever gotten relating to sound compared to the other midway games with source preserved
general 2023-01-20 16:39:25 shame the mk2 source got dmca'd though
general 2023-01-20 16:42:09 revX just had the final sound roms and a sound call table
general 2023-01-21 02:38:16 hi evo
general 2023-01-21 03:08:05 so true
general 2023-01-21 03:08:33 i was told i need a midway gsp dev board?
general 2023-01-21 03:08:54 don't even know what that is
general 2023-01-21 05:41:27 live toasty sighting
general 2023-01-21 05:41:49 i've got infinite time and energy and just grinding to see it
general 2023-01-21 05:43:32 screen or gpu
general 2023-01-21 05:43:49 not good
bot-central 2023-01-21 07:39:20 !rank
general 2023-01-21 08:48:29 hi ember
general 2023-01-21 09:03:41 yeah cause they can’t just ask someone else
general 2023-01-21 09:03:50 or look into it
general 2023-01-21 09:22:21 refuse to believe this
general 2023-01-21 09:25:10 one time i got a discount for a pixel phone for adding bullshit to google maps
general 2023-01-21 09:27:09 are you at least sleeping more than before
general 2023-01-21 09:27:23 ok good
general 2023-01-21 09:29:13 he retired
general 2023-01-21 09:32:08 somebody in the starfox server is experimenting with all range mode in the 1st game
general 2023-01-21 09:32:42 not as polished as what it would end up being in starfox 2 but it's a good start
general 2023-01-21 10:34:46 who
general 2023-01-21 14:15:25 that’s rodusk
general 2023-01-21 14:15:47 he called me out for not being banned and that’s how i know he’s legit
general 2023-01-21 14:16:43 this is amorie esther
general 2023-01-21 14:17:10 amorie was rodusk
general 2023-01-21 14:17:15 iirc
general 2023-01-21 14:17:17 yeah
general 2023-01-21 14:17:36 cad how do you not know this
general 2023-01-21 14:17:55 yeah you must’ve
general 2023-01-21 14:42:45 apparently revX is buildable from source?
general 2023-01-21 14:43:03 thought there were tools missing for that
general 2023-01-21 14:43:28 but apparently the output has a few errors
general 2023-01-22 03:45:08 praise
general 2023-01-22 03:45:14 should go on the mechanism
general 2023-01-22 08:41:25 what
general 2023-01-22 08:41:50 unfunny
general 2023-01-22 10:19:37 it is what it is
general 2023-01-22 10:26:50 we’re used to it no need
general 2023-01-22 12:14:53 wtf pfp and colour change
general 2023-01-22 12:14:55 unheard of
general 2023-01-22 12:17:01 yeah but it's been so long since you've done it
general 2023-01-22 12:48:27 wtf
general 2023-01-22 12:58:18 of course
general 2023-01-22 13:16:07 https://youtu.be/DDrb_Rw6kCM <@761354294859005962>
general 2023-01-22 13:56:35 cad has experience
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:08:32 whole point is to improve
general 2023-01-23 00:12:16 average nbn installation <@513966516958658561>
general 2023-01-23 00:12:52 the grind
general 2023-01-23 00:13:14 mine was actually alright surprisingly
general 2023-01-23 00:50:59 yeah exactly
general 2023-01-23 01:08:32 ^
general 2023-01-23 04:49:05 he just knows
general 2023-01-23 05:31:49 cool
general 2023-01-23 08:58:20 never forgive konami for taking out kool 1 in the snes version of turtles in time
general 2023-01-23 09:00:10 snes version is trying to sort of recreate the fm in the original but it honestly just fails and sounds kind of bad compared to the original arcade version
general 2023-01-23 09:00:14 only the hottest takes
general 2023-01-23 09:02:56 tbh it would've sounded better on the megadrive
general 2023-01-23 09:21:01 i don't know anything about what's going on so it's not a "whitename moment"
general 2023-01-23 09:21:25 he was here before
general 2023-01-23 13:05:06 messi is in mortal kombat
general 2023-01-23 13:05:08 watch out
general 2023-01-23 13:39:34 i try to replace a voice sample in mortal kombat and somehow the other samples get messed up
general 2023-01-23 13:39:45 file isn't bigger or anything
general 2023-01-23 13:39:57 it just sort of stopped working
general 2023-01-23 14:21:39 <@370594904268734464> i made a custom sound rom for the original mortal kombat (arcade version)
general 2023-01-23 15:08:36 yeah
general 2023-01-23 15:17:40 you have it?
general 2023-01-23 15:17:49 damn
general 2023-01-23 15:18:24 sorry sometimes i'm a bit stupid
general 2023-01-24 07:09:06 kind of don't believe it
general 2023-01-24 11:01:01 the addiction
general 2023-01-24 11:16:25 now time to figure out how the fuck this should be set up
general 2023-01-24 11:16:37 oh and i also need to see the prebuilt rev2 rom
general 2023-01-24 11:18:11 no that person was never here
general 2023-01-24 11:18:18 this is in another server
general 2023-01-24 12:00:14 the w
general 2023-01-24 12:11:47 it happens
general 2023-01-24 13:04:27 smonk3
general 2023-01-24 13:39:43 they fucking banned me from google maps
general 2023-01-24 13:39:53 i mean the local guides shit
general 2023-01-24 13:40:01 because i broke 7 of their rules
general 2023-01-24 13:40:29 out of 10
general 2023-01-24 13:40:38 for being too funny
general 2023-01-24 13:40:54 google maps
general 2023-01-24 13:40:56 the whole thing
general 2023-01-24 13:41:03 it was a good run
general 2023-01-24 13:41:40 <@200793484053970944> if you just check spotswood on google maps you can get a general idea of something i've done
general 2023-01-24 13:41:52 and yes that road is fake
general 2023-01-24 13:41:57 of course it is
general 2023-01-24 13:42:24 those 157 added places are all bullshit
general 2023-01-24 13:43:31 i did something similar for chernobyl
general 2023-01-24 13:43:37 but long review
general 2023-01-24 13:43:49 and talked about how you can get power from the water
general 2023-01-24 13:43:55 and that it's run by tourists
general 2023-01-24 13:44:43 the most views i got on something on google maps was almost 70k
general 2023-01-24 13:44:53 and that was a park in france
general 2023-01-24 13:45:03 that i edited to be called "park division"
general 2023-01-24 13:45:06 i think it's still up

general 2023-01-24 13:47:09 i fixed the french spelling
general 2023-01-24 13:47:42 if you scroll around that general area you can find other gems
general 2023-01-24 13:48:04 including the fake road i added
general 2023-01-24 14:06:25 yeah i fixed the spelling
general 2023-01-24 14:07:12 <@200793484053970944> you have to check out spotswood since there’s a line of houses that are just names “building (number)”
general 2023-01-24 14:07:18 among other things
general 2023-01-24 14:07:28 what
general 2023-01-24 14:07:37 there’s building 1 through 21

general 2023-01-24 14:10:42 i only violated 7 of the 10 rules come on google
general 2023-01-24 14:11:29 so good
general 2023-01-24 14:11:33 
general 2023-01-24 14:11:47 it's separate territory
general 2023-01-24 14:12:05 i wonder if the finest hotel is now visible on the map

general 2023-01-24 14:16:03 nope
general 2023-01-24 14:19:07 
general 2023-01-24 14:19:15 i wonder if google will still send me emails about this place
general 2023-01-24 14:19:28 there was another one too but it got deleted by google
general 2023-01-24 14:19:34 just called "park"
general 2023-01-24 14:19:40 i'm not in france so no

general 2023-01-24 14:55:56 
general 2023-01-24 14:56:28 who would buy
general 2023-01-24 14:57:32 the question is why did you sit through it and watch it
general 2023-01-24 14:58:06 honestly yeah it’s looking more like that
general 2023-01-24 15:37:07 doesn’t know but still says he probably invented it lmao
general 2023-01-24 15:37:51 yeah he did everything first
general 2023-01-24 15:37:56 nobody else
general 2023-01-24 15:39:11 if you invented all those things where’s your inventor role
general 2023-01-25 01:24:44 but it’s not funny
general 2023-01-25 01:24:58 idk just kind of stupid
general 2023-01-25 01:26:19 now chiseled - your server can literally get deleted by discord because of the <13 problem
general 2023-01-25 01:26:25 fix it up
general 2023-01-25 01:27:15 well that's good to hear
general 2023-01-25 01:27:27 true
general 2023-01-25 01:28:26 now here's an issue, it doesn't say you have to be 13 or older to join the server
general 2023-01-25 01:28:59 yeah but no 12 year olds read the tos don't they
general 2023-01-25 01:30:43 <@900865317373374555> maybe moderator age requirement should be raised just like how it is here
general 2023-01-25 01:31:08 better decision making (hopefully)
general 2023-01-25 01:36:12 fair
general 2023-01-25 01:51:10 well that's not really constructive isn't it
general 2023-01-25 01:51:16 i think he should stay banned
general 2023-01-25 04:41:17 probably not
general 2023-01-25 04:41:38 the stupid promo cds for the midway arcade games are rare as shit
general 2023-01-25 04:42:04 the ones i know of are mortal kombat 2 and revolution x
general 2023-01-25 04:45:01 the mk2 one is on discogs, revx isn't
general 2023-01-25 04:45:14 infact there's a copy of the mk2 one being sold for 400 dollars on ebay
general 2023-01-25 04:47:16 i mean yeah it's rare but that's overpriced as shit

general 2023-01-25 23:48:58 oh no
general 2023-01-25 23:56:48 what he's implying is that you didn't deserve the rank
general 2023-01-25 23:57:00 idk i haven't seen what got you the rank in the first place
general 2023-01-25 23:57:26 talking about the quality of the build
general 2023-01-25 23:57:35 holy shit
general 2023-01-25 23:57:39 oh well

general 2023-01-25 23:59:58 3 separate times
general 2023-01-26 00:00:31 explain it cause i'm completely lost with this
general 2023-01-26 00:01:08 if you need to verify can't you just make another roblox account and not bother with a separate discord
general 2023-01-26 00:01:41 idk i don't have experience with this it's confusing
general 2023-01-26 00:02:34 just talk here since nobody else is talking
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:03:10 what does this have to do with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:03:15 this is about discord accounts
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:03:19 go back to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:04:09 honestly yeah i can understand that, it happens
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:04:15 but why couldn't you verify
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 00:04:30 the only way that can happen is if the account isn't over 13
general 2023-01-26 00:05:14 just say undes
general 2023-01-26 00:05:46 because he was letting them in even though someone said, and i quote "most of us are 12"
general 2023-01-26 00:14:54 well that's stupid
general 2023-01-26 00:14:58 you had the rank
general 2023-01-26 00:15:21 if you were still here and didn't get banned they wouldn't take the rank away so why should they not give you it back
general 2023-01-26 00:21:23 of course goldeneye on nso is butchered in some way
general 2023-01-26 00:21:29 i'm not surprised

general 2023-01-26 02:35:52 everyone's source is just one post from a random guy on reddit and everyone's accepting it as fact
general 2023-01-26 04:30:42 if only yousuf was still mod
general 2023-01-26 04:31:42 would be funny
general 2023-01-26 04:31:54 it’s been going since the 24th
general 2023-01-26 04:40:46 oh well
general 2023-01-26 04:40:59 enlist the help of other mods
general 2023-01-26 04:41:43 no this is warnable
general 2023-01-26 04:41:57 because people have been warned for this
general 2023-01-26 04:42:02 in bug reports
general 2023-01-26 04:43:25 so you’re comparing discord warns to that??
general 2023-01-26 04:43:31 that’s a bit extreme

general 2023-01-28 03:25:23 oh yeah why does hyperbot not accept mov files here?
general 2023-01-28 03:25:41 iirc there was like a bug or something but that was years ago
general 2023-01-28 03:25:57 yeah so why are they still blocked
general 2023-01-28 03:26:11 i don't think tsunami has perms to do that
general 2023-01-28 03:26:23 honestly fair
general 2023-01-28 03:30:10 ragetheking sighting
general 2023-01-28 03:30:37 contrary to popular belief our military doesn't use spiders
general 2023-01-28 03:31:14 i got some stupid looking thing earlier and didn't bother sending the screenshot
general 2023-01-28 03:31:21 idk anything about tanks
general 2023-01-28 03:31:40 fight desired
general 2023-01-28 03:31:43 think about it
general 2023-01-28 03:36:13 facebook marketplace special
general 2023-01-28 09:58:11 this guy
general 2023-01-28 10:08:44 can't believe this
general 2023-01-28 10:14:40 fake
general 2023-01-28 10:16:49 there's no gif of the goofy kintaro walk
general 2023-01-28 10:18:20 if i make the stupid kintaro walk gif either the background will be green or i'll make it black
general 2023-01-28 11:13:21 this place is a shithole
general 2023-01-28 11:14:28 idk
general 2023-01-28 11:14:31 we all are
general 2023-01-28 11:15:39 jomankujo happened

general 2023-01-28 11:20:00 yeah he's gone
general 2023-01-28 11:20:07 idk what happened to him exactly
general 2023-01-28 11:31:57 he knows something we don't
general 2023-01-28 11:34:27 i've gotten good at doing the ejb code in mortal kombat 2
general 2023-01-28 15:50:24 what channel?
general 2023-01-28 15:50:35 yes i'm up at 3am again
general 2023-01-28 15:50:37 the grind
general 2023-01-28 16:08:20 you can't
general 2023-01-28 16:08:22 sorry
general 2023-01-29 10:05:08 no
general 2023-01-29 10:08:57 did they really
general 2023-01-29 10:10:08 i wouldn't use it anyway
general 2023-01-29 10:10:42 i listen to stuff on my own so it's a bit weird for me to have it like that
general 2023-01-29 14:12:45 getting given access to demo recordings for a game ost that only 3 people care about lol
general 2023-01-29 14:12:54 going to try to preserve it somehow
general 2023-01-29 14:43:15 ?
general 2023-01-29 17:12:40 was going to say “who did that” but then obc talked here
general 2023-01-30 04:38:54 i put mine on nothing
general 2023-01-30 07:18:11 it’s so real
general 2023-01-30 12:56:00 kiuzeo why are you yellow now
general 2023-01-30 12:56:42 i don't know
general 2023-01-30 12:56:44 sorry
general 2023-01-31 00:54:00 it's so slow that there is nothing polished to show
general 2023-01-31 08:56:13 you're still here somehow
general 2023-01-31 08:56:39 thought you went ages ago
general 2023-01-31 09:12:47 yeah makes sense
general 2023-01-31 09:13:18 the fight
general 2023-01-31 09:53:02 nah that's tasmania
general 2023-01-31 09:53:06 <@200793484053970944> confirm
general 2023-01-31 11:40:16 there already was a really partial face reveal in the cooking stream
general 2023-01-31 11:40:24 like extremely small
general 2023-01-31 11:40:30 but it happened
general 2023-01-31 11:42:15 yeah that was basically the full extent of it lol
general 2023-01-31 11:44:54 lmao
general 2023-01-31 11:45:12 no - just really really slow progress
general 2023-01-31 11:46:03 monitor burn in?
general 2023-01-31 11:46:04 what type
general 2023-01-31 11:46:11 well the type of monitor
general 2023-01-31 11:46:15 shit
general 2023-01-31 11:46:21 what type of screen is in it
general 2023-01-31 11:47:12 if you search up phone model it'll probably come up with the type of screen
general 2023-01-31 11:47:31 old arcade crt monitors are terrible for burn in
general 2023-01-31 11:54:27 there was some vulnerability years ago and they never bothered removing the filter for it
general 2023-01-31 11:55:09 honestly i don't know if it's obc or hyperbit
general 2023-01-31 11:55:13 i forgot
general 2023-01-31 11:55:25 <@451025784228806656> you know who maintains hyper?
general 2023-01-31 11:55:37 who?
general 2023-01-31 11:55:48 i forgot if it was obc or hyperbit
general 2023-01-31 11:56:23 doesn't want a shitshow involving the mov filter
general 2023-01-31 12:00:19 falded hiking stream
general 2023-01-31 12:04:43 i mean if you want to send a video on mobile it's annoying but you can send it in another server and copy the media link
general 2023-01-31 12:05:39 knew that name looked familiar
general 2023-01-31 12:06:57 all depends on how the bot was made
general 2023-01-31 12:07:42 like if it's sort of toggleable in a way then it can just be disabled
general 2023-01-31 12:07:51 but the thing is nobody knows
general 2023-01-31 12:07:55 and will never know
general 2023-01-31 12:08:05 and there's most likely more to it
general 2023-01-31 12:08:38 if it was that easy then it probably would've been disabled
general 2023-01-31 12:08:48 a while ago
general 2023-01-31 12:09:58 so i think that there might be a bit of a process with disabling filters, plus obc is busy with uni so
general 2023-01-31 12:09:59 yeah
general 2023-01-31 12:10:54 matt rose launched stupid marketplace ads into the mainstream
general 2023-01-31 12:11:52 this is such a deal
general 2023-01-31 12:12:18 no this is electric milk
general 2023-01-31 12:13:05 and this is really worth it
general 2023-01-31 12:15:56 i think people have
general 2023-01-31 12:16:00 but idk
general 2023-01-31 12:22:16 xbox rerelease of n64 goldeneye has worse audio than the original
general 2023-01-31 12:22:58 over 25 years since initial release yet it manages to sound worse on a modern system what a mess
general 2023-01-31 12:23:36 like noticeably worse at that
general 2023-01-31 12:23:57 there's like some distortion on some samples?
general 2023-01-31 13:13:01 i have literally been here longer and i still have half the amount you have
general 2023-01-31 13:13:25 no i actually do stuff other than talk here
general 2023-01-31 13:14:20 not fake but just moving really really slowly
general 2023-01-31 13:16:49 yeah it actually is moving along but he never shows anything since there is nothing polished to show
general 2023-01-31 13:24:07 hate group
general 2023-01-31 13:24:16 easy warn
general 2023-01-31 13:24:31 i think fuzzy would care
general 2023-02-01 05:18:07 and that's a perm for his main too iirc
general 2023-02-01 05:18:59 i remember something like that going on but idk
general 2023-02-01 05:21:53 over 3 days
general 2023-02-01 05:22:09 can't believe this lmao
general 2023-02-01 05:41:52 here we go
general 2023-02-01 05:42:31 not that
general 2023-02-01 07:10:31 he’s planning
general 2023-02-01 07:12:45 i used wii shop channel in 2023
general 2023-02-01 07:14:03 also i should somehow back up the wii channels i have
general 2023-02-01 07:14:26 i still have the installer channels for multiple ones
general 2023-02-01 07:15:35 like it would just show a bunch of info and crap and have a button to go to the shop channel to get it
general 2023-02-01 07:16:06 can get to hidden pages of the wii shop channel using those
general 2023-02-02 12:44:13 smink
general 2023-02-02 13:01:01 ?
general 2023-02-03 01:48:49 jonas
general 2023-02-03 01:50:46 he's on that grind
general 2023-02-03 02:16:43 shader not good
general 2023-02-03 02:17:41 hi koy
general 2023-02-03 02:17:56 sorry have to go i'll talk later
general 2023-02-03 02:18:10 probably like around 2 hours
general 2023-02-03 02:18:14 alr bye
general 2023-02-03 04:41:26 <@832352865804484628> back for a bit
general 2023-02-03 04:42:39 uhh
general 2023-02-03 04:42:43 not the best tbh
general 2023-02-03 05:59:47 the funny
general 2023-02-03 06:50:16 do not speak of them
general 2023-02-03 06:51:03 yeah honestly i sort of feel bad for them
general 2023-02-03 06:51:19 but they themselves haven't really done great things
general 2023-02-03 07:50:50 everyone knows them for beach walk and nothing else
general 2023-02-03 07:50:53 shame
general 2023-02-03 07:52:45 i'm convinced moving shadow actually still has audio masters cause one of their uploads has the cleanest version of the "feel better" remix i've ever heard
general 2023-02-03 07:56:38 not to mention all the uploads of their cd mixes going from 98.1 to 05.2
general 2023-02-03 08:06:46 fun fact 01.1 was the one used for msx fm in gta3
general 2023-02-03 08:07:24 msx is literally the moving shadow station
general 2023-02-03 08:43:23 "fixed" twitter
general 2023-02-04 02:42:03 what are your thoughts on every target location in wa being converted to shooting ranges
general 2023-02-04 09:20:44 1am is the time ever
general 2023-02-04 09:33:35 lmao
general 2023-02-04 09:58:20 why did you get unbanned
general 2023-02-04 09:59:18 didn't you go on an alt after your ban
general 2023-02-04 10:01:04 yeah if you read rules you would know alts aren't allowed lol
general 2023-02-04 10:02:39 can't you look at dyno dms and just work out if you're getting banned or not
general 2023-02-04 10:03:20 that's strange
general 2023-02-04 10:03:25 usually it comes instantly
general 2023-02-04 12:40:08 i just walked into this
general 2023-02-05 04:59:37 hi darkz
general 2023-02-05 06:44:02 true

general 2023-02-05 06:45:20 he's the best
general 2023-02-05 06:46:01 why did you want to know btw?
general 2023-02-05 06:48:06 oh nice
general 2023-02-05 06:50:17 if you wanted to know the exact date when i last talked to him it was the 30th of january
general 2023-02-05 06:50:46 nah 2005
general 2023-02-05 06:51:03 (current year)
general 2023-02-05 06:51:20 no it is 2005 now wdym
general 2023-02-05 07:07:01 he got modlogs in 2 days
general 2023-02-05 08:24:19 no context
general 2023-02-05 08:25:09 i got this from a
general 2023-02-05 08:25:10 source
general 2023-02-05 08:27:34 kind of want an analogue mixer console
general 2023-02-05 08:27:37 would be cool
general 2023-02-06 05:36:01 capture it
general 2023-02-06 05:36:05 could be useful
general 2023-02-06 05:36:27 give the parts to me
general 2023-02-06 10:24:38 that was the time ever
general 2023-02-06 11:23:45 never watched that video
general 2023-02-06 12:24:44 that's not a bypass lol
general 2023-02-07 11:36:31 hi koy
general 2023-02-07 11:37:35 you doing alright?
general 2023-02-10 12:44:58 the stupid town with no name game literally uses the same bass as the original pilotwings game i'm done
general 2023-02-11 09:11:32 you should go search up “24/7 natural pool” in the google maps search bar
general 2023-02-11 09:12:25 have you gotten all the blue coins at yellowstone
general 2023-02-11 09:12:47 sad
general 2023-02-11 09:13:01 there’s a guide for all the blue coins at yellowstone
general 2023-02-11 09:16:35 is that the uhh
general 2023-02-11 09:16:40 all stars version
general 2023-02-11 09:16:53 idk i never really got into mario games
general 2023-02-11 09:18:27 one of the most controversial opinions i have is that super mario world is just “okay”
general 2023-02-11 09:19:17 i mean i beat smw twice, one of them was a 100% run
general 2023-02-11 09:21:08 and the other is that sm64 is overhyped
general 2023-02-11 09:21:59 a lot of the early textured 3d games don’t look that great
general 2023-02-11 09:22:47 i mean obviously yeah they don’t look that great by today’s standards but flat shaded polygons look more appealing to me
general 2023-02-11 09:23:12 original virtua racing arcade game is a great example
general 2023-02-11 09:23:35 actually put out more polys than the original daytona
general 2023-02-12 07:20:22 <@456226577798135808> they added cars to zelda watch out
general 2023-02-12 07:54:00 yeah have you seen the new totk trailer
general 2023-02-12 08:09:43 that was such a moment
general 2023-02-12 08:09:47 the math argument
general 2023-02-12 08:59:45 wdym 2021 was 2 years ago it's 2005
general 2023-02-12 08:59:47 way off
general 2023-02-12 09:00:01 it is 2005 now
general 2023-02-12 09:00:09 not great
general 2023-02-12 09:00:14 that was last year
general 2023-02-12 09:00:15 keep up
general 2023-02-12 09:02:19 impossible
general 2023-02-12 09:02:22 years must be off
general 2023-02-12 09:02:27 only explanation
general 2023-02-12 09:02:49 who are you
general 2023-02-12 09:10:33 that isn't good
general 2023-02-12 09:10:37 something is wrong
general 2023-02-12 09:11:01 true
general 2023-02-12 09:11:22 oh it's a laptop
general 2023-02-12 09:11:25 all makes sense now
general 2023-02-12 09:12:09 (bomb)
general 2023-02-12 09:13:07 from the future
general 2023-02-12 09:14:27 this is the best mk game

general 2023-02-12 09:14:39 this is peak
general 2023-02-12 09:18:01 wdym opened the grill
general 2023-02-12 09:18:39 yeah
general 2023-02-12 10:15:28 wow hi skoove
general 2023-02-12 10:16:03 i only send a few messages here sometimes
general 2023-02-12 10:18:50 yeah it has
general 2023-02-12 10:18:58 haven't properly played the game in
general 2023-02-12 10:19:00 ages
general 2023-02-12 10:19:24 bye skoove
general 2023-02-12 10:21:01 splatoon had a literal race war in game once
general 2023-02-12 10:21:10 i'm not even joking too
general 2023-02-12 10:21:28 whole event that was celebrated
general 2023-02-12 10:23:04 oh yeah hi koy
general 2023-02-12 10:23:44 wow it's john
general 2023-02-12 10:24:41 good to hear
general 2023-02-12 10:25:32 gonna be honest not great
general 2023-02-12 10:26:28 don't want to talk here so i'll just go to dms
general 2023-02-13 07:13:01 benox has been a furry for ages
general 2023-02-13 07:13:11 surprised people are just realising now
general 2023-02-13 09:02:59 lol
general 2023-02-13 09:04:05 the goal
general 2023-02-13 09:27:37 top
general 2023-02-13 09:28:50 literal british icon
general 2023-02-15 03:39:06 why was there a gimp file
general 2023-02-15 03:39:14 project file
general 2023-02-15 03:41:00 from my manjaro experience, linux isn't as complicated as what people make it out to be
general 2023-02-15 03:41:38 the windows 11 "show more options" menu infuriates me
general 2023-02-15 03:41:59 makes things slower for me to do
general 2023-02-15 03:42:27 instead of just selecting 7z from the regular right click menu i have to go to another menu
general 2023-02-15 03:42:35 adds up over time
general 2023-02-15 03:43:38 mig using stereotypes against people who like stuff he hates yet again
general 2023-02-15 03:43:55 well not really hates, more like dislikes
general 2023-02-15 03:44:58 oh ok
general 2023-02-15 03:45:05 well more like predators
general 2023-02-15 03:55:33 there's a reason why warnings exists on certain things
general 2023-02-15 03:56:05 also should point out i haven't used linux in over 2 years so yeah
general 2023-02-15 03:56:08 there's that
general 2023-02-15 03:56:48 windows user and always will be, already established on there
general 2023-02-15 03:57:08 it's just that linux isn't what everyone makes it out to be
general 2023-02-15 04:00:32 don't know where the linux and programming link came from, i know basically nothing about coding
general 2023-02-15 04:02:09 it comes down to what you use it for
general 2023-02-15 04:02:34 if you do please don't include me in anything, kind of serious about it
general 2023-02-15 04:02:54 no like actually
general 2023-02-15 04:03:12 i don't want a presence here
general 2023-02-15 04:04:01 i think teknoparrot is limited to windows
general 2023-02-15 04:04:07 can probably use wine for that though
general 2023-02-15 08:22:03 that speechbubble
general 2023-02-15 08:22:42 very smart
general 2023-02-15 10:23:03 how dare you call it burger king
general 2023-02-15 10:23:09 hungry jack's all the way
general 2023-02-15 12:49:17 pcc moment
general 2023-02-15 12:59:48 surprisingly no
general 2023-02-15 13:00:51 this is my doing
general 2023-02-15 13:01:08 it's on this random temple where i also added every mk2 stage
general 2023-02-15 13:02:14 already tried
general 2023-02-15 13:02:19 failed

general 2023-02-15 13:14:38 the amount of torture i put spotswood though
general 2023-02-15 13:14:42 deserved
general 2023-02-15 13:15:35 just keep adding stuff around the mystery flesh pit
general 2023-02-15 13:15:38 would be funny
general 2023-02-15 13:17:23 slowly spread throughout cranbourne
general 2023-02-15 13:18:59 wtf is chadstone tower 1
general 2023-02-15 13:19:06 looks like something i would add
general 2023-02-15 13:19:37 true
general 2023-02-15 13:22:31 thought i submitted the request for chadstone tower 2 but it was on the similar place screen
general 2023-02-15 13:22:57 
general 2023-02-15 13:23:16 middle of the parking lot
general 2023-02-15 13:25:20 spotswood wasn't prepared for the hate group or the bi shop
general 2023-02-15 13:26:09

general 2023-02-15 13:36:03 since they changed the name of it to sea life or some shit
general 2023-02-15 13:36:26 really good waste of money
general 2023-02-15 13:36:46 it's shit now

general 2023-02-15 13:43:04 still gaining levels despite being banned from local guides
general 2023-02-15 13:44:33 just submitted "waste of space"

general 2023-02-15 13:44:56 aw it got denied for some reason
general 2023-02-15 13:48:02

general 2023-02-15 13:51:13 before just sending it
general 2023-02-15 13:51:22 what in like plane crazy?
general 2023-02-15 13:51:34 i don't play roblox anymore

general 2023-02-15 14:35:13 fastest racist
general 2023-02-16 08:09:31 hi seyo
general 2023-02-16 08:17:05 was pinged??
general 2023-02-16 08:31:06 not great
general 2023-02-16 08:31:14 wbu
general 2023-02-16 09:25:55 another great edit in cranbourne
general 2023-02-16 09:26:24 honestly have to start grinding on my account which actually is in local guides
general 2023-02-16 09:54:32 exact target audience
general 2023-02-16 09:54:40 they knew what they were doing
general 2023-02-16 11:07:21 wow very late
general 2023-02-16 11:07:23 maybe sleep
general 2023-02-16 11:07:36 fair enough
general 2023-02-16 11:07:43 i get like that sometimes
general 2023-02-16 11:08:30 gun
general 2023-02-16 11:09:10 i think playing that stupid messi mortal kombat game is slightly improving my skills at regular classic mk
general 2023-02-16 11:09:13 for some reason
general 2023-02-16 11:09:58 classic mk in my eyes includes mk1, mk2, and mk3/umk3
general 2023-02-16 11:19:25 when did your school year start?
general 2023-02-16 11:20:00 holy shit lmao
general 2023-02-16 11:20:22 3 days out of over a month
general 2023-02-16 11:21:33 fully just given up
general 2023-02-16 11:21:37 that's bad
general 2023-02-16 11:21:59 he should make an attempt to come back at least
general 2023-02-16 11:22:17 like start small and eventually work up if his stress is that bad
general 2023-02-16 11:22:28 ^
general 2023-02-16 11:22:45 hm
general 2023-02-16 11:23:06 yeah you need school
general 2023-02-16 11:23:11 it's crucial
general 2023-02-16 11:24:28 pay is so high
general 2023-02-16 11:24:46 probably going to be overworked too
general 2023-02-16 11:24:52 like most of the time
general 2023-02-16 11:27:19 some of the people ever
general 2023-02-16 11:27:20 tradies
general 2023-02-16 11:27:42 it's like vm now or something
general 2023-02-16 11:27:46 idk i don't do it
general 2023-02-16 11:28:07 nah i'm in vce
general 2023-02-16 11:29:02 no i'm year 11
general 2023-02-16 11:29:50 don't really want to talk about this stuff though since i come here to document cool shit (well to me at least)
general 2023-02-16 11:30:14 don't want to be in any screenshots or anything anymore so please delete
general 2023-02-16 11:31:46 basically i just don't want to appear in any pcc things anymore, don't like exposure
general 2023-02-16 11:34:15 mk1's "remastered" ost is terribly mixed
general 2023-02-16 11:34:37 like holy shit even i can probably do better and i don't even bother with mixing
general 2023-02-16 11:37:40 there are some gems but you have to know where to look
general 2023-02-16 11:38:23 subnautica had an ost?
general 2023-02-16 11:38:34 i beat the entire game and didn't notice
general 2023-02-16 11:38:40 oh no it's this crowd
general 2023-02-16 11:39:02 i've found more satisfaction with 90s drum and bass compared to game osts
general 2023-02-16 11:39:46 there is some overlap, specifically with moving shadow releases (they licensed songs out)
general 2023-02-16 11:39:54 for instance msx fm in gta 3
general 2023-02-16 11:40:10 literally moving shadow mix fm
general 2023-02-16 11:40:45 (it's their 01.1 cd sampler but in game)
general 2023-02-16 11:41:13 why
general 2023-02-16 11:46:39 most people who have any idea of this area probably know of the track "circles", "only you" by intense, or the peshay studio set as a whole
general 2023-02-16 11:46:58 oh and goldie's "timeless" as well
general 2023-02-16 11:47:12 21 minute experience
general 2023-02-16 11:48:05 there's the album "timeless" but also the track (which is what i'm talking about)
general 2023-02-16 11:49:06 goldie also worked on "the shadow" with moving shadow founder rob playford (timecode)
general 2023-02-16 11:57:37 hi yousuf
general 2023-02-16 12:00:10 need the original wimp tool cause might be actually useful
general 2023-02-16 12:02:34 (proprietary midway graphics tool)
general 2023-02-17 00:39:26 or do you not want to be called that again
general 2023-02-17 00:39:47 oh sorry
general 2023-02-17 00:40:03 you doing alright?
general 2023-02-17 01:28:50 there actually is but he's not sharing anything cause there's nothing to share
general 2023-02-17 01:28:55 going at a snail's pace
general 2023-02-17 01:29:22 if he would share something it would be very basic and not polished at all
general 2023-02-17 02:13:17 i've somehow kept an original ipad 2 (2011 one) more cleaner than that
general 2023-02-17 02:13:25 fucking hell
general 2023-02-17 05:06:46 what’s the obsession with asking kiuzeo for feet pics
general 2023-02-17 05:06:51 i don’t get it
general 2023-02-17 05:13:45 pcc moment
general 2023-02-17 07:55:19 damn you're still here?
general 2023-02-17 08:30:30 i think everyone does
general 2023-02-17 08:30:34 well most people
general 2023-02-17 11:29:46 yeah cause pinging the dev twice will solve the problem
general 2023-02-17 11:29:51 so smart
general 2023-02-17 11:30:19 i am adding mortal kombat 3 to cranbourne and nobody will stop me
general 2023-02-17 11:30:35 every location
general 2023-02-17 11:52:26 where's this at
general 2023-02-17 11:52:31 i'll add a place on it
general 2023-02-17 11:53:12 oh wow <@448505589983739914> you're still here?
general 2023-02-17 11:53:41 thought he was gone a while ago
general 2023-02-17 11:54:59 fair enough
general 2023-02-17 11:55:10 alright place should be there relatively soon
general 2023-02-17 11:59:07 actually i need a specific location
general 2023-02-17 11:59:15 not the coordinates
general 2023-02-17 12:04:38 alright submitted the request
general 2023-02-17 12:05:34 
general 2023-02-17 12:07:04 nah it's the exact location of this
general 2023-02-17 12:07:14 like exact
general 2023-02-17 12:08:12 
general 2023-02-17 12:08:16 coordinates match too
general 2023-02-17 12:08:26 well close enough
general 2023-02-17 12:08:51 nah
general 2023-02-17 12:08:53 that random plane
general 2023-02-17 12:09:05 i don't live at jfk airport
general 2023-02-17 12:09:29 i really don't care
general 2023-02-17 12:22:23 peak edits
general 2023-02-17 12:22:48 obviously means that they get to play mk3 irl
general 2023-02-17 12:25:03 every stage will be added
general 2023-02-17 12:37:02 
general 2023-02-17 12:37:07 only waiting on the rooftop
general 2023-02-17 12:43:01 it is done
general 2023-02-18 08:20:47 not going to comment on that
general 2023-02-18 16:02:15 \
general 2023-02-18 23:16:49 yeah everyone knows about those kinds of people here
general 2023-02-18 23:16:58 tech can you save my roles just in case
general 2023-02-18 23:17:21 ok
general 2023-02-18 23:17:22 thanks
general 2023-02-18 23:17:43 doesn't mean i'm leaving, just making sure they're saved
general 2023-02-19 08:05:08 the zuggyj riots
general 2023-02-19 08:05:26 and then he complained on youtube
general 2023-02-19 08:05:31 really great
general 2023-02-19 08:12:19 wait is hofung's account deleted?
general 2023-02-19 08:12:40 that's the actual hofung
general 2023-02-19 08:12:54 no it is
general 2023-02-19 08:13:05 there's no "maybe" here
general 2023-02-19 08:13:44 it's literally hofung

general 2023-02-19 08:16:07 i was literally there
general 2023-02-19 08:16:15 i saw it happen
general 2023-02-19 12:05:27 damn hi spell
general 2023-02-19 12:06:45 yeah how you doing?
general 2023-02-19 13:13:31 wtf is a meme leader
general 2023-02-19 13:13:40 have we really gotten to this point
general 2023-02-20 08:59:44 hi yousuf, how's life now
general 2023-02-20 08:59:55 i should've asked earlier
general 2023-02-20 09:00:31 that's good
general 2023-02-20 10:44:15 actual terrible idea
general 2023-02-21 21:22:45 yeah
general 2023-02-21 21:22:52 no banned
general 2023-02-21 21:24:59 3 warns
general 2023-02-21 21:25:16 yeah same
general 2023-02-22 00:48:36 has been like that for a while lol
general 2023-02-22 08:21:43 you aren't "we", people might find it interesting
general 2023-02-22 08:21:47 i did
general 2023-02-22 08:29:41 no clue
general 2023-02-23 04:44:01 the tank ever created
general 2023-02-23 04:51:13 mk3 is the only classic mk game we have the original midi sequences for
general 2023-02-23 04:51:34 i'm kind of glad because mk3 has the best ost out of all 3 classic games
general 2023-02-23 04:52:06 kind of unusable without the kurzweil k2000 + other gear though
general 2023-02-23 04:52:39 i think that also includes the roland jv1080 and an ensoniq unit, idk which one though
general 2023-02-23 04:53:55 i know about the ensoniq cause of this
general 2023-02-23 04:54:22 if you listen to "the subway" from mk3 that is the exact sequence with the rack bell
general 2023-02-23 04:56:07 the doc included with the sequences also says that there's a proteus/1 preset used to back the guitar melody
general 2023-02-23 04:56:16 i think it might be custom
general 2023-02-23 04:58:07 everything except the rack bell sequence is gm because i don't have a k2000 or the proteus preset
general 2023-02-23 04:58:12 but it's there
general 2023-02-23 04:59:00 this is dan forden's original midi file, i think the street has an unused track?
general 2023-02-23 05:02:47 
general 2023-02-23 05:11:54 i like sharing stuff, if you don't like it you can simply just ignore
general 2023-02-23 05:22:35 wtf happened lol
general 2023-02-23 05:25:19 another person destroyed by shitty discord moderation lol
general 2023-02-23 05:25:54 at least not as bad as koy's ban
general 2023-02-23 05:26:01 like really not as bad
general 2023-02-23 05:26:59 holy shit when did you get back
general 2023-02-23 05:27:09 wtf
general 2023-02-23 05:28:06 hipster i thought you were done with pcc
general 2023-02-23 05:28:27 true
general 2023-02-23 05:29:32 it literally happened
general 2023-02-23 05:30:19 if they don't accept it you'll be banned for 4 years lmao
general 2023-02-23 05:30:25 just like what happened with koy
general 2023-02-23 05:30:45 iirc she appealed and it got denied
general 2023-02-23 05:30:58 or idk
general 2023-02-23 05:31:08 it's been a while so don't remember most things
general 2023-02-23 05:31:23 false discord ban
general 2023-02-23 05:32:12 how was your day
general 2023-02-23 05:32:43 true
general 2023-02-23 05:32:55 mk3's pit fatality is literally a grinder machine
general 2023-02-23 05:33:03 i rarely get the stage so i didn't know
general 2023-02-23 05:33:10 and idk how to do stage fatalities
general 2023-02-23 05:33:33 in mk1 it's just an uppercut but they locked it behind a code in mk2 and beyond
general 2023-02-23 05:33:45 alr cya later
general 2023-02-23 05:34:33 only fatality i know is messi
general 2023-02-23 05:34:38 always on that messi grind

general 2023-02-23 12:37:26 i'd call it an atmospheric dnb track
general 2023-02-23 12:37:46 or "intelligent dnb" if you want to use that term
general 2023-02-23 12:37:51 nah e-z rollers
general 2023-02-23 12:37:57 real classic stuff
general 2023-02-23 12:38:23 the track i sent came out in 97
general 2023-02-23 12:38:58 was licensed out by moving shadow for toca 2 but i discovered it on blueprint
general 2023-02-23 12:39:18 and the full version at that, not this version found on weekend world
general 2023-02-23 12:39:57 try now
general 2023-02-23 12:42:03 what was that for again
general 2023-02-23 12:42:06 i forgor
general 2023-02-23 12:42:17 oh yeah
general 2023-02-23 12:43:42 everyone here knows this track

general 2023-02-23 12:45:01 better than what i would do lol
general 2023-02-23 12:47:39 man i'm still waiting for that ex-zodiac update which was promised "just after christmas"
general 2023-02-23 12:48:17 i understand why though
general 2023-02-23 12:48:25 it's literally the one guy working on the game
general 2023-02-23 12:49:07 and this isn't like rickje with his team or anything, if you check the credits it's just the one guy for basically everything
general 2023-02-23 12:49:10 except music
general 2023-02-23 12:49:15 since +tek did it
general 2023-02-23 12:49:23 passion project
general 2023-02-23 12:49:26 love ex-zodiac
general 2023-02-23 12:49:42 amazing game so far
general 2023-02-23 12:50:05 level 7 does exist since the backer build has a version of it
general 2023-02-23 12:50:37 i still come back to it just to see if i can score higher on any level
general 2023-02-23 12:52:24 https://youtu.be/s62T2A2fLiY
general 2023-02-23 12:52:56 it's starfox on steroids
general 2023-02-23 12:53:34 basically "what if starfox was faster gameplay-wise and we put it on arcade hardware"
general 2023-02-23 12:54:53 why can't i just play my offline game without steam updating
general 2023-02-23 12:55:56 too much effort
general 2023-02-23 12:58:34 the grind
general 2023-02-23 12:58:36 like actually

general 2023-02-25 00:45:53 the fact that it's from a private server is something else
general 2023-02-25 00:46:20 why would you add that
general 2023-02-25 00:57:14 somewhere out there exists 3d models of mk3 background assets

general 2023-02-25 13:03:49 entire jv setup lagged when i watched the video
general 2023-02-25 13:04:03 i still need to open like 2 more
general 2023-02-25 13:12:54 fear
general 2023-02-26 00:17:49 yeah basically
general 2023-02-26 00:17:54 i've never played it
general 2023-02-26 00:23:04 what
general 2023-02-26 01:45:23 less than a day ago a video about some guy’s first experience with the first mortal kombat back in 1992 got taken down
general 2023-02-26 01:45:42 before you say “it’s violent”, i watched the video and there was barely any
general 2023-02-26 01:45:54 there are undeniable issues with youtube
general 2023-02-26 01:46:23 violence even though there was barely any shown
general 2023-02-26 01:50:53 you gotta remember the original mortal kombat really isn’t violent, it’s old arcade hardware
general 2023-02-26 01:51:00 more over the top than realistic
general 2023-02-26 02:39:46 damn nice name
general 2023-02-26 03:00:50 in the lava pit
general 2023-02-26 03:03:20 i just bombed someone but it might be too violent for pcc lol
general 2023-02-26 07:11:06 holy shit how do you spend that much time playing ddlc
general 2023-02-26 07:11:54 tf happened
general 2023-02-26 07:12:13 lmao
general 2023-02-26 07:13:45 no like seriously isn’t there only like 3 endings
general 2023-02-26 07:14:08 did you spend all that time on the last screen with monika or something
general 2023-02-26 07:14:27 oh ok
general 2023-02-26 07:14:33 that explains it
general 2023-02-26 07:16:25 understandable
general 2023-02-26 07:17:20 so true
general 2023-02-26 07:18:32 wait what
general 2023-02-26 07:19:17 hi hipster

general 2023-02-26 07:22:01 
general 2023-02-26 07:22:25 i though that was the other version
general 2023-02-26 07:22:28 whoops
general 2023-02-26 07:24:18 what are the red and green dots for
general 2023-02-26 07:25:00 ah okay
general 2023-02-26 10:25:13 only a little bit extreme
general 2023-02-26 10:29:25 jesus
general 2023-02-26 10:29:52 and to think a server admin in another server is saying this lmao
general 2023-02-26 10:30:11 
general 2023-02-26 10:30:22 this isn't a great look btw
general 2023-02-26 10:31:49 so you just assume stuff, cool
general 2023-02-26 10:37:27 this random whitename that used the wrong channel, got called out for it, and now this
general 2023-02-26 10:37:31 the funny events
general 2023-02-26 10:37:52 oh yeah he's also a server admin at that
general 2023-02-26 10:38:14 parc national de france
general 2023-02-26 10:41:03 views on classic dnb:
general 2023-02-26 10:41:44 i can see how it's repetitive but i still somehow enjoy sitting through an hour long set
general 2023-02-26 10:49:59 virtua cop one of the games ever made
general 2023-02-26 10:50:30 wouldn't be surprised if this came from one of the zero g datafiles
general 2023-02-26 10:50:43 i can't be bothered to look
general 2023-02-26 10:58:44 what was that server again
general 2023-02-26 10:58:54 i think you talked about it somewhere
general 2023-02-26 10:58:55 idk
general 2023-02-26 10:59:13 the one the screenshot came from
general 2023-02-26 10:59:27 yeah that's what it was
general 2023-02-26 10:59:45 which song?
general 2023-02-26 11:04:12 <@740790456182636595> ok yeah you're right lol
general 2023-02-26 11:05:26 i actually thought it was good
general 2023-02-26 11:06:14 yeah it's completely different than what i usually listen to but honestly if it sounds good to me i like it
general 2023-02-26 11:08:29 really unfamiliar with jazz cause i've stuck to classic dnb and stuff
general 2023-02-26 11:25:50 might've been funny the first 2 times but now it's just not
general 2023-02-26 11:26:40 doesn't affect me but it's just forced now
general 2023-02-26 11:28:00 he's no tech master
general 2023-02-26 11:28:05 he's a fraud
general 2023-02-26 11:30:24 saw some people praising this one dnb album so i might have to go download it and check it out sometime
general 2023-02-26 11:30:29 forgot what it was called
general 2023-02-26 11:43:46 it's a bit "out there" for me but good so far
general 2023-02-26 11:44:30 i prefer tracks that are more grounded in reality
general 2023-02-26 11:46:18 top revs
general 2023-02-26 11:47:10 alright new record for single longest track in my playlist
general 2023-02-26 11:47:47 before it was timeless clocking in at around 21 minutes
general 2023-02-26 11:50:22 too hard
general 2023-02-26 11:51:10 people on their way to compare 2 albums that sound really different:
general 2023-02-26 11:52:14 nah
general 2023-02-26 11:52:21 wtf
general 2023-02-26 11:52:40 hi yousuf
general 2023-02-26 11:53:13 if he says help i instantly assume the worst
general 2023-02-26 11:53:44 falded you can't do this
general 2023-02-26 11:54:43 yeah timeless might be overrated (only like 3 songs worth listening to), but i wouldn't compare timeless with this other album
general 2023-02-26 11:54:48 they're too different
general 2023-02-26 11:55:16 have to say inner city life is one of the best classic dnb tracks i've listened to though
general 2023-02-26 12:00:07 nvm my rip was terrible
general 2023-02-26 12:24:32 listened to the entire base album, was actually good
general 2023-02-27 01:30:12 back to blurple wow
general 2023-02-27 01:32:33 so true
general 2023-02-27 01:34:32 when will creditory come back
general 2023-02-27 05:05:52 effects of prolonged discord exposure
general 2023-02-27 05:06:16 more specifically being in the wrong places
general 2023-02-27 06:26:20 nothing like the real deal
general 2023-02-27 06:27:55 what one you planning on getting
general 2023-02-27 06:29:09 looks good
general 2023-02-27 06:29:19 sorry i don’t know much about cameras
general 2023-02-27 07:40:08 the main part of twitter is really something
general 2023-02-27 07:40:48 yeah i don’t go to those parts lol
general 2023-02-27 07:54:12 best use of mod apps
general 2023-02-27 07:56:14 he’s got the right idea
general 2023-02-27 08:53:57 did computer get false banned or something
general 2023-02-27 08:59:37 the obs recording window
general 2023-02-27 08:59:53 wait what
general 2023-02-27 08:59:59 how does it look like that
general 2023-02-27 09:00:00 wtf
general 2023-02-27 09:00:06 is it 60fps
general 2023-02-27 09:00:27 just wondering cause i recorded something with the xbox thing and it was 30fps
general 2023-02-27 09:00:36 even though game was running at clear 60
general 2023-02-27 09:00:56 even have fps counter enabled in the clip
general 2023-02-27 09:01:18 the grind
general 2023-02-27 09:08:19 is it fine if i watch
general 2023-02-27 11:06:08 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/983921280162099260/1074531099826454538/kill-1.gif
general 2023-02-27 11:06:46 no way
general 2023-02-27 11:30:47 hipster i actually did something alright for once
general 2023-02-27 11:30:51 wow!
general 2023-02-27 11:31:44 went through the effort to get the bass sample from a yt video and got the bass channel sort of there
general 2023-02-27 11:31:51 yeah sorry it's about my usual bs
general 2023-02-27 11:32:23 starfox pick bass way better tbh
general 2023-02-27 11:33:11 also might work better on a real kurzweil k2000 but i don't have one
general 2023-02-27 11:33:58 why did i say for a yt video i got it from a yt video
general 2023-02-27 11:34:53 ?
general 2023-02-27 11:36:05 read <#925522972586967092>
general 2023-02-27 11:37:47 literally almost the entirety of the mk3 ost is k2000
general 2023-02-27 11:38:08 idfk what to do since i would get a vst if there was one
general 2023-02-27 11:38:31 but there's none

general 2023-02-27 12:29:03 a small mistake
general 2023-02-27 14:13:39 gn
general 2023-02-28 02:54:44 got the bass up
general 2023-02-28 03:16:53 how you gonna get there it's in cranbourne
general 2023-02-28 03:18:38 
general 2023-02-28 03:18:42 are there multiple locations lmao
general 2023-02-28 03:18:59 this is the one that falded showed me
general 2023-02-28 03:19:21 yeah nah they made it a real thing
general 2023-02-28 03:19:48 can't believe there's more than 1
general 2023-02-28 03:20:20 i don't live in cranbourne so good luck
general 2023-02-28 03:21:06 visiting mystery flesh pit national park irl challenge
general 2023-02-28 10:10:55 he knows all strategies
general 2023-02-28 10:13:09 what
general 2023-02-28 10:57:52 the truth
general 2023-03-01 03:37:58 hi koy
general 2023-03-01 10:09:12 honestly i sort of agree with him, there comes a point where things look out of place in the game
general 2023-03-01 10:10:04 idk it's just my opinion
general 2023-03-01 10:10:36 keep in mind i also don't want a hd remaster of the original starfox so yeah
general 2023-03-01 10:11:24 the look is crucial to the feel of the game, would the original starfox have the same feel with arcade hardware? hell no
general 2023-03-01 10:11:57 it would be a pretty unimpressive game if limitations were removed
general 2023-03-01 10:12:17 i think he's talking about the level of detail
general 2023-03-01 10:12:28 yes detail is good
general 2023-03-01 10:13:07 but there's a line between "out of place" and "really good"
general 2023-03-01 10:13:31 i can't really explain it but it's just my view on things
general 2023-03-01 10:13:50 but that build doesn't come close to that line

general 2023-03-02 08:26:56 when will the mk3 graphics leak
general 2023-03-02 08:27:08 last part of the source that is needed
general 2023-03-03 07:56:09 the fuck
general 2023-03-03 07:56:38 yeah nah i'll just stay away from here
general 2023-03-03 08:05:24 literally the discord mod
general 2023-03-03 08:05:26 the first one ever
general 2023-03-03 10:26:37 one of the hacks ever made
general 2023-03-03 10:27:05 i don't watch simpleflips or anything i just know of the guy
general 2023-03-03 11:54:31 too much smink
general 2023-03-16 16:17:42 so true
general 2023-03-16 16:18:06 oh yeah i'm temporarily out of hibernation
general 2023-03-16 16:19:17 i'm collecting archives
general 2023-03-16 16:19:30 kinda forgot about the new embed system
general 2023-03-16 16:21:03 thriller demo tracks almost done, still got a few more to get
general 2023-03-16 16:23:06 what i've had to work with on 2 occasions
general 2023-03-16 16:23:25 is there really 97 tracks? fucking hell
general 2023-03-17 11:15:39 lmao
general 2023-03-18 02:17:16 whoops
general 2023-03-18 02:17:30 love my laptop touchscreen
general 2023-03-18 09:52:46 i should actually take a proper look at the "scream" stems
general 2023-03-18 09:53:16 it's 5 minutes long while the album version is 4:38
general 2023-03-18 10:29:41 extremely rough, not done well at all but at least it's here and semi listenable
general 2023-03-18 12:30:36 how does that work?
general 2023-03-18 12:31:06 never had anything like that happen with google
general 2023-03-18 12:51:20 pretty sure hyper does block mov files, not dyno
general 2023-03-18 12:51:49 been questioning that for a long time
general 2023-03-18 12:52:35 only in detroit
general 2023-03-18 12:59:31 hi
general 2023-03-18 13:00:36 how you doin
general 2023-03-18 13:04:17 feeling ok rn
general 2023-03-18 13:10:04 slowly getting back to speed, mostly audio related stuff now
general 2023-03-18 13:13:55 oh god
general 2023-03-18 13:34:02 i do not want to remember pug
general 2023-03-18 13:34:40 "i'm going to leave the server!", proceeds to come back straight after
general 2023-03-18 13:34:48 couldn't go a day without pcc
general 2023-03-18 13:34:58 inventer is good friend
general 2023-03-18 13:35:19 he literally got me into drum and bass
general 2023-03-18 13:36:01 has he actually
general 2023-03-18 13:36:06 i'm not surprised
general 2023-03-18 13:37:47 did you see that screenshot of the starfox subreddit that i sent
general 2023-03-18 13:37:52 fuckin hell
general 2023-03-18 13:38:06 ok i recommend you don't read it
general 2023-03-18 13:39:11 still into it right now
general 2023-03-18 13:39:16 always on the grind
general 2023-03-18 13:41:22 there are way worse servers than pcc
general 2023-03-18 13:42:01 first of all this leak server i'm in (bunch of 4channers in there so you can guess how that goes)
general 2023-03-18 13:42:19 boxness server is a shithole
general 2023-03-18 13:42:23 many pcc subservers
general 2023-03-18 13:42:32 yep
general 2023-03-18 13:42:48 that's what i'm referring to with "many pcc subservers"
general 2023-03-18 13:43:25 yeah i kind of don't know sorry
general 2023-03-18 13:43:52 he had a server?
general 2023-03-18 13:43:55 never knew
general 2023-03-18 13:44:47 oh god
general 2023-03-18 13:45:52 yeah
general 2023-03-18 13:45:58 hate most subservers
general 2023-03-18 13:46:13 was gonna say birb gang
general 2023-03-18 13:46:28 fat cave was genuinely one of the worst places i've been in
general 2023-03-18 13:47:29 very confusing situation
general 2023-03-18 13:48:30 hoping to archive some more rare dnb uploads on slsk today
general 2023-03-18 13:49:52 i've completely lost interest in plane crazy for a long time
general 2023-03-18 13:52:16 melvomel
general 2023-03-18 13:52:21 kind of miss that username
general 2023-03-18 13:52:49 that's koyshee btw
general 2023-03-18 13:53:32 i miss how things were back then
general 2023-03-18 13:53:41 although
general 2023-03-18 13:54:00 you eventually need to move on
general 2023-03-18 13:54:13 way better
general 2023-03-18 13:54:15 i'll say that
general 2023-03-18 13:54:25 since when did he go?
general 2023-03-18 13:54:27 fuck man
general 2023-03-18 13:54:33 i miss pct
general 2023-03-18 13:54:52 what the fuck
general 2023-03-18 13:55:37 imo really detailed builds now look almost too detailed if you sort of know what i'm saying
general 2023-03-18 13:55:50 like they don't even belong in the game
general 2023-03-18 13:56:12 gammarad was a racist
general 2023-03-18 13:56:57 aesthetic is important to me, hate it when assets look out of place or heavily modified
general 2023-03-18 13:57:15 it's why i'm not a fan of shaders
general 2023-03-18 13:57:35 or the idea of a hd remaster of the original starfox
general 2023-03-18 13:57:45 it sort of looks wrong to me
general 2023-03-18 13:58:35 similar to the horrible "pixel shader" things in emulators which smooth the sprites and shit
general 2023-03-18 13:58:44 it looks wrong
general 2023-03-18 13:59:46 it doesn't fit
general 2023-03-18 13:59:48 at all
general 2023-03-18 14:00:36 seats
general 2023-03-18 14:00:51 looks plain without seats
general 2023-03-18 14:01:23 makes it look more interesting with seats
general 2023-03-18 14:02:28 one of the only emulator enhancements i really like is hd mode 7 and widescreen for snes
general 2023-03-18 14:02:52 because hd mode 7 just makes it so the full res tilemap is used
general 2023-03-18 14:03:13 looks really good with pilotwings and f-zero
general 2023-03-18 14:04:18 kind of missing that feeling of height in pilotwings though
general 2023-03-18 14:05:21 https://youtu.be/6VrzJ6Y1kjQ
general 2023-03-18 14:07:20 wtf lmao
general 2023-03-18 14:08:05 https://youtu.be/AlloemRUYrU video is literally like this
general 2023-03-18 14:08:53 and i thought 16:9 stretching was bad
general 2023-03-18 14:11:57 no with emulators
general 2023-03-18 14:12:19 when they were intended to use 4:3
general 2023-03-18 14:13:54 what the fuck i showed someone that pilotwings video and they recreated the setup with mega man x2
general 2023-03-18 14:20:09 <#925522972586967092>
general 2023-03-18 14:20:31 you're welcome
general 2023-03-18 14:25:03 another moving shadow single added to the list of things to get
general 2023-03-18 14:25:11 and rip in lossless
general 2023-03-18 14:40:48 one thing i've noticed with all the dnb stuff i collect and listen to is that i usually prefer mixes, sets, or compilations rather than full blown albums from an artist
general 2023-03-18 14:42:26 only really good classic dnb album i've come across which is solid throughout is self evident truth of an intuitive mind
general 2023-03-18 14:53:26 drum and bass
general 2023-03-19 01:28:32 no multitracks for history in my mj multitrack archive :shambles:
general 2023-03-19 01:29:24 i can sort of assemble black or white using the surviving studio multitracks and stems from the laptop leak
general 2023-03-19 03:29:03 hi koy
general 2023-03-19 03:34:36 how you doin?
general 2023-03-19 03:37:01 that's good
general 2023-03-19 03:37:35 slowly getting back to speed
general 2023-03-19 03:37:56 just ok rn
general 2023-03-19 04:09:12 human nature demo version
general 2023-03-19 04:09:14 soon
general 2023-03-19 04:12:51 top vocal track is more rough, but both are for this demo version
general 2023-03-19 07:13:13 was pretty funny
general 2023-03-19 12:29:23 only a little bit late
general 2023-03-19 12:29:41 yeah i'll get your ip with an mp3
general 2023-03-19 12:31:27 i need better stuff than audacity
general 2023-03-19 12:31:53 something that can handle 97 wav files at once preferably
general 2023-03-19 12:36:23 i did manage to pull off a total redo of the smooth criminal project files for audacity 3 (way better than 2) but i had to do it through my desktop
general 2023-03-19 12:36:37 had to split it across 2 project files
general 2023-03-19 12:37:02 around 2gb per project file
general 2023-03-19 12:38:36 i left notes on the source tracks in a private server, there are 2 bass instruments
general 2023-03-19 12:39:15 album version has rimshots and clicks while the original moonwalker mix here doesn't
general 2023-03-19 12:39:33 only in the inbetween section or whatever it is
general 2023-03-19 12:48:08 ^
general 2023-03-19 14:37:55 wouldn’t be surprised if there are people actually like this on here
general 2023-03-21 12:01:01 why do you have the worst element as your status
general 2023-03-21 12:01:05 very not good
general 2023-03-21 12:01:23 francium
general 2023-03-21 12:01:52 everything in france is made with francium after what happened with the statue of liberty
general 2023-03-21 12:02:10 they used all their good stuff on the statue so they only have francium now
general 2023-03-22 11:34:49 been casually missing a whole demo track and multitrack archive from the mj laptop leak because it wasn't in the original gdrive
general 2023-03-22 11:35:04 glad i have other sources to complete the collection
general 2023-03-22 11:35:50 i need to upload everything somewhere but not sure where
general 2023-03-22 11:36:46 so true
general 2023-03-22 11:37:17 but i can't upload the archive to archive.org, it'll be taken down instantly
general 2023-03-22 11:37:32 also it's over 140gb so i'll be sitting there for a while
general 2023-03-22 12:20:35 hi yousuf
general 2023-03-22 12:25:19 doing ok
general 2023-03-22 12:25:22 wbu
general 2023-03-22 12:26:05 that's good to hear
general 2023-03-22 12:37:30 you just delete
general 2023-03-22 12:42:30 i have been missing this for over a month
general 2023-03-22 12:43:08 idk where to start with archival
general 2023-03-22 12:45:30 future records cds for dangerous also desperately need to be archived but that's not happening anytime soon
general 2023-03-22 14:47:41 wtf
general 2023-03-24 07:21:40 both horizon games were really good, enjoyed both of them
general 2023-03-24 07:22:07 not counting that as a main game
general 2023-03-24 07:22:33 got plat in both of them, real shame i can’t play the dlc for fw
general 2023-03-24 07:25:27 taking the whole “gacha games are gambling” thing to the next level
general 2023-03-24 07:25:53 literally a fucking slot machine
general 2023-03-24 07:26:31 and this is why i’ve lost interest in gaming nowadays
general 2023-03-24 07:26:54 everything is evolving yet also getting worse at the same time
general 2023-03-24 07:27:26 like in terms of tech and scope, yes it’s evolving
general 2023-03-24 07:27:44 but the actual gameplay part is going backwards
general 2023-03-24 07:29:40 despite the ai being absolute bullshit in classic mk games, i've had the most fun playing mk1, 2, and umk3 recently
general 2023-03-24 07:39:40 dead
general 2023-03-24 08:12:37 what is this and why do i keep seeing it
general 2023-03-24 08:17:39 was gonna do the bomb fatality but didn't do it in time
general 2023-03-24 08:18:11 if you want to get started with classic mk mk1 or umk3 are your best choices
general 2023-03-24 08:18:19 mk2 has the most bs ai
general 2023-03-24 08:18:49 no microtransactions, no gacha shit, no p2w, just get straight into it
general 2023-03-24 08:19:41 one of the worst parts of modern gaming
general 2023-03-24 08:22:29 did the fatality
general 2023-03-24 08:24:05 gotta do the ejb code
general 2023-03-24 08:25:36 and done
general 2023-03-24 08:25:55 timing just a little bit tight
general 2023-03-24 08:28:38 i still have to learn how to do animalities
general 2023-03-24 08:29:08 scorpion's penguin one is the best
general 2023-03-24 08:32:05 egg is a bomb
general 2023-03-24 08:32:47 umk3
general 2023-03-24 08:33:01 the final classic mk arcade game before they became 3d
general 2023-03-24 08:33:29 yeah
general 2023-03-24 08:33:40 they all used to be digitised graphics
general 2023-03-24 08:34:09 backgrounds use parallax scrolling
general 2023-03-24 08:34:58 even mk1 uses parallax but the board umk3 runs on is more advanced
general 2023-03-24 08:35:16 midway wolf unit iirc
general 2023-03-24 08:36:29 mk4 has a sick goro's lair remix though
general 2023-03-24 08:36:58 don't know anything about the gameplay except it has a funny man on the side of the arcade cabinet
general 2023-03-24 08:37:10 (quan chi)
general 2023-03-24 08:37:48 mk4 still uses the same audio technology from mk2 but slightly better
general 2023-03-24 08:40:40 mk3's ost was so good that it got released on vinyl
general 2023-03-24 09:00:04 the toasty
general 2023-03-24 09:00:24 
general 2023-03-24 09:02:21 yeah
general 2023-03-24 09:02:26 this is from the source code
general 2023-03-24 09:02:53 just the little voice clip when dan forden pops on screen
general 2023-03-24 09:03:42 all of the sound is also compressed to be put on the roms using magic
general 2023-03-24 09:06:19 43kb to 2kb after compression
general 2023-03-24 09:09:20 
general 2023-03-24 09:24:16 
general 2023-03-24 09:27:10 need to do the babality next
general 2023-03-24 09:29:04 oh wait can't do the babality on kintaro
general 2023-03-24 09:35:38 
general 2023-03-24 09:35:53 now time for the most bullshit boss
general 2023-03-24 09:35:55 shao kahn
general 2023-03-24 09:38:49 and there we go
general 2023-03-24 09:39:19 2nd time beating the game
general 2023-03-24 09:39:29 i beat mk1 once, mk2 twice, and umk3 3 times
general 2023-03-24 09:40:16 yeah fuzzy does fuck all
general 2023-03-24 09:40:19 honestly
general 2023-03-24 09:40:33 you
general 2023-03-24 09:40:35 talk
general 2023-03-24 09:41:51 what's the thing even meant to be about
general 2023-03-24 09:42:09 oh my god
general 2023-03-24 09:42:24 on one hand i want to say yes but i also want to say no
general 2023-03-24 09:42:49 i hate presenting
general 2023-03-24 09:43:19 don't like people looking at me
general 2023-03-24 09:43:49 it's true though
general 2023-03-24 09:44:48 good to know
general 2023-03-24 09:45:22 idk i'm just always worried about that shit anywhere i go
general 2023-03-24 09:45:26 not only presenting
general 2023-03-24 09:46:41 (almost) dcs ready version of the subway!
general 2023-03-24 09:46:50 mono 31250hz
general 2023-03-24 09:47:04 theoretically this can be ported back to mk2
general 2023-03-24 09:47:33 true i need cd quality
general 2023-03-24 09:47:36 44100hz
general 2023-03-24 09:48:03 but the original dat tapes used for the sounds and music were recorded at 31250hz
general 2023-03-24 09:48:44 
general 2023-03-24 09:48:54 the mk2 source got dmca'd months ago
general 2023-03-24 09:49:43 i'm surprised the partial mk3 source wasn't dmca'd after years
general 2023-03-24 09:49:52 or any of the other midway source code archives
general 2023-03-24 09:52:01 hi koy
general 2023-03-24 09:52:19 moonwalker (completely unrelated to the megadrive version)
general 2023-03-24 09:53:59 hru
general 2023-03-24 09:56:56 that's really nice
general 2023-03-24 09:57:48 doing better
general 2023-03-24 09:58:06 oh yeah kind of forgot you were in a different timezone
general 2023-03-24 09:58:35 why does the music in arcade moonwalker sound worse than the megadrive version
general 2023-03-24 09:59:59 i don't think international french day was a success for them
general 2023-03-24 10:01:22 worst element
general 2023-03-24 10:01:38 france has to use it because they used up everything else on the statue of liberty
general 2023-03-24 10:05:24 idk it just happens lmao
general 2023-03-24 10:06:11 https://youtu.be/ALyDjinV-eU best dnb album
general 2023-03-24 10:06:25 i have not listened to something that has this much consistency
general 2023-03-24 10:07:44 i don't even know what that is, i only really listen to stuff released from the 90s up to the 2000s
general 2023-03-24 10:07:49 very casual listener
general 2023-03-24 10:08:57 only tracks i really like on goldie's timeless are timeless and sea of tears
general 2023-03-24 10:11:33 inner city life is a good single
general 2023-03-24 10:27:05 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/830156606641012737/1081899212532355092/timefloor.gif
general 2023-03-24 10:27:12 mk2 timefloor parallax
general 2023-03-24 10:27:20 idk why this wasn't in the final game
general 2023-03-24 10:47:38 good
general 2023-03-24 10:51:54 to learn
general 2023-03-24 10:52:28 i should buy a copy of HIStory sometime
general 2023-03-24 10:52:38 i've already got an original copy of dangerous
general 2023-03-24 10:53:34 no
general 2023-03-24 10:54:05 i don't know why i only have dangerous and none of the other albums though
general 2023-03-24 10:54:07 weird
general 2023-03-24 10:54:41 i've got rhythm nation but that's janet so it doesn't count
general 2023-03-24 10:57:35 isn't there supposed to be a synth part before janet first sings in scream
general 2023-03-24 10:57:40 am i going crazy
general 2023-03-24 11:01:07 so it's in the original mix but not the album version?
general 2023-03-24 11:01:22 it's in here
general 2023-03-24 11:03:03 https://tenor.com/view/dance-mortal-kombat-dancing-disco-gif-10980654
general 2023-03-24 11:05:26 fun fact - scream uses 2 samples from in the closet throughout the track
general 2023-03-24 11:05:49 and i think in the original mix there's a bit of rhythm nation there
general 2023-03-24 11:08:07 i don't even care about the game anymore
general 2023-03-24 11:09:07 and mj swears in scream (insane)
general 2023-03-24 11:10:12 falded is literally straight
general 2023-03-24 11:12:13 best mj outfit is the smooth criminal one
general 2023-03-24 11:12:16 undeniable fact
general 2023-03-24 11:13:07 and then you got the dangerous outfit which is the smooth criminal outfit but a different colour
general 2023-03-24 11:13:49 6
general 2023-03-24 11:13:58 (next year)
general 2023-03-24 11:15:33 really hard to choose between the 2 but smooth criminal on top
general 2023-03-24 11:22:38 no hard
general 2023-03-24 11:23:07 what game are you even playing
general 2023-03-24 11:23:19 never heard of it
general 2023-03-24 11:23:41 yeah makes sense now
general 2023-03-24 11:24:21 oh and it's mobile too
general 2023-03-24 11:24:37 yeah there was no way i'd know about it
general 2023-03-24 11:27:52 i've got thriller but not really thriller
general 2023-03-24 11:28:13 will throw anyone off if they listen to it
general 2023-03-24 11:28:59 hot take thriller is overrated
general 2023-03-24 11:29:54 i mean the vocal layering is really something but the song is kind of
general 2023-03-24 11:29:55 idk
general 2023-03-24 11:30:37 i've only seen that level of layering with off the wall
general 2023-03-24 11:32:06 https://youtu.be/cJnRMdLpX80
general 2023-03-24 11:36:16 not worth it
general 2023-03-24 11:37:42 actually yeah you've invested so much time into the game already
general 2023-03-24 11:38:28 how do you rack up so much time in games holy shit
general 2023-03-24 11:38:40 true
general 2023-03-24 11:38:51 gotta break out audacity again (it might crash)
general 2023-03-24 11:39:13 yeah idk what else i can use
general 2023-03-24 11:39:32 i've just always had audacity on my laptop
general 2023-03-24 11:40:12 running a little bit low on space
general 2023-03-24 11:40:15 only a little
general 2023-03-24 11:41:11 woo it's crashing again
general 2023-03-24 11:41:19 fuck yeah audacity
general 2023-03-24 11:41:49 (it's only opening like 9 tracks at once)
general 2023-03-24 11:42:16 shouldn't be throwing a fit i've opened over 50 tracks at once before
general 2023-03-24 11:43:24 holy shit it actually opened
general 2023-03-24 11:46:25 anyone want jam without that stupid voice in the background (stem is called talk)
general 2023-03-24 11:47:10 i've assembled the full version of smooth criminal twice
general 2023-03-24 11:47:16 i'd do it again if i have to
general 2023-03-24 11:51:33 my 1tb external drive:
general 2023-03-24 11:52:05 150gb of it is dedicated to leaked michael jackson files
general 2023-03-24 11:53:19 technically i didn't choose to use audacity with the jam stems, brad sundberg did
general 2023-03-24 11:53:30 because there was an aup left in the files
general 2023-03-24 11:56:06 yeah audacity just has to
general 2023-03-24 11:56:09 import
general 2023-03-24 12:00:24 i can probably sample the overdrive guitar from 2bad
general 2023-03-24 12:01:42 76 tracks condensed into 10 stems
general 2023-03-24 12:01:45 wow
general 2023-03-24 12:07:48 i just realised i'm posting mj without mj
general 2023-03-24 12:07:52 well mostly
general 2023-03-24 12:08:52 i'm not going to open 76 tracks and try to mix them because audacity will hate it
general 2023-03-24 12:15:19 the goods
general 2023-03-24 12:17:42 i can't listen to that one song on the bad album without hearing "brad what are ya gonna do? what are you gonna do?"
general 2023-03-24 12:18:02 yeah lol
general 2023-03-24 12:18:37 and "job's gone, breakdown"
general 2023-03-24 12:32:54 i have never heard a dnb track with trumpets and a timpani other than cops don't like us by e-z rollers
general 2023-03-24 12:33:04 only the rollers can do stuff like that
general 2023-03-24 12:34:38 yeah was gonna say
general 2023-03-24 12:36:27 moving shadow website has all of their album cover art at 1600x1600, some are svg files like msxep002 (the one cops don't like us is on)

general 2023-03-24 12:38:19 the rough criminal

general 2023-03-24 12:40:51 doesn't realise the portal to that appears in the sky
general 2023-03-24 15:13:55 
general 2023-03-24 15:23:08 i want the why you wanna trip on me multitracks to get that guitar slide thing idk the proper name
general 2023-03-24 15:23:39 hi bean

general 2023-03-25 14:27:51 question - what should i name my great edit of rhythm nation i'm going to make
general 2023-03-25 14:28:14 making it sound shit
general 2023-03-25 14:28:21 has to be the opposite
general 2023-03-25 14:28:32 i already did rough criminal for smooth criminal
general 2023-03-25 14:28:47 definitely going to do unrhythm something
general 2023-03-25 14:29:49 true
general 2023-03-25 15:27:37 removing the word rhythm from rhythm nation and calling it unrhythm village
general 2023-03-25 15:45:19 i spent way too long removing "rhythm" from the backing
general 2023-03-25 15:45:36 it's so good now
general 2023-03-25 15:45:46 just says "we are a part of the nation"
general 2023-03-25 15:45:48 every time
general 2023-03-25 15:45:53 not the rhythm nation
general 2023-03-25 15:46:35 kind of have to actually look at these multis properly after i do this though it's really good
general 2023-03-25 15:47:07 fucking hell i need to change more shit to just nation
general 2023-03-25 15:53:29 took too much effort in audacity
general 2023-03-25 15:53:41 i had to do it manually every time
general 2023-03-25 15:54:01 select rhythm, copy, delete, paste in the blank space, then delete
general 2023-03-25 15:54:39 only a little bit of doing that
general 2023-03-25 15:54:58 these multitracks were really hard to get
general 2023-03-25 15:56:44 fuckin hell found the synth bass track
general 2023-03-25 15:56:57 gonna have to crank that up in a few ways
general 2023-03-25 15:58:09 best settings
general 2023-03-25 15:58:32 this is just for the bass track
general 2023-03-25 15:58:41 janet will definitely be audible
general 2023-03-25 15:58:47 a bit different though
general 2023-03-25 15:59:47 oh fuck
general 2023-03-25 16:00:04 is there an acoustic bass in rhythm nation?
general 2023-03-25 16:05:16 i haven't played properly since 2020
general 2023-03-25 16:05:48 i'm convinced that some shit here doesn't even belong to rhythm nation
general 2023-03-25 16:08:02 janet pitched down doesn't sound as bad as i thought
general 2023-03-25 16:08:05 wow
general 2023-03-25 16:10:31 wow there's a cue mix of the video version of rhythm nation
general 2023-03-25 16:10:55 
general 2023-03-25 16:11:18 it has the cueing thing for videos
general 2023-03-25 16:11:23 sort of like time locked
general 2023-03-25 16:11:36 (it's mono)
general 2023-03-25 16:12:10 oh wait shit there's no lyrics
general 2023-03-25 16:12:12 wtf

general 2023-03-26 08:14:22 virtua racing grind:
general 2023-03-26 08:15:05 except in virtua racing you go at top speed and manipulate the game in order to take tight corners
general 2023-03-26 10:55:26 only mirrors i know of are a couple magnet links
general 2023-03-26 10:55:37 dedicated 150gb of drive space to this
general 2023-03-26 11:34:33 woah e-z rollers is on twitch wtf
general 2023-03-26 11:47:06 listen to some mj or something idk
general 2023-03-26 11:57:37 the studio quality version of chicago 1945 (not the song chicago on xscape)
general 2023-03-26 11:58:02 i don't really like it but it's finally archived
general 2023-03-26 12:00:11 i saw can't help it and i thought the original track was just included with the other stuff
general 2023-03-26 12:00:30 but then i actually listened to the original track on off the wall
general 2023-03-26 12:00:35 it's actually a demo
general 2023-03-26 12:01:58 i also don't know if this one black and white version is actually a demo or a edited new mix
general 2023-03-26 12:03:55 lore does not mean plot
general 2023-03-26 12:24:25 international french day was not a success
general 2023-03-26 12:24:51 they didn't bomb the entirety of indonesia
general 2023-03-26 12:25:00 this is why france is in anarchy
general 2023-03-26 12:25:39 last year they bombed the philippines
general 2023-03-26 12:25:44 wild success
general 2023-03-26 12:26:22 they only do this on international french day because it takes them a year to get the plane ready
general 2023-03-26 12:26:34 made of francium
general 2023-03-26 15:55:14 this must be the rough criminal

general 2023-03-27 10:25:16 https://tenor.com/view/scorpion-mortal-kombat-washing-hands-gif-10502758
general 2023-03-27 10:25:43 true
general 2023-03-27 10:27:08 i could remake enjoy yourself by sampling off the wall
general 2023-03-27 10:27:12 but everyone's already done it
general 2023-03-27 10:41:59 if you have some sort of knowledge about vaporwave this might sound familiar
general 2023-03-27 10:45:28 rod temperton wrote thriller and off the wall
general 2023-03-27 10:45:29 wow
general 2023-03-27 10:46:16 (technically wrote thriller twice but yeah)
general 2023-03-27 10:57:22 wow hi parrot
general 2023-03-27 10:57:31 haven't seen you in a while
general 2023-03-27 10:58:42 i mean i've been here for almost 3 years at this point so you've probably seen me
general 2023-03-27 10:58:48 holy shit
general 2023-03-27 10:58:49 3 years
general 2023-03-27 10:58:51 wtf
general 2023-03-27 10:59:11 where did it all go
general 2023-03-27 10:59:40 nah i've been doing other stuff too
general 2023-03-27 10:59:56 also you can't say shit cause you've been here for a long time too lmao

general 2023-03-27 11:04:07 no
general 2023-03-27 11:08:20 and then janet sung:
general 2023-03-27 11:08:25 truly a musical masterpiece
general 2023-03-27 11:08:44 i can't compose shit
general 2023-03-27 11:08:57 i only edit stuff
general 2023-03-27 11:09:06 to make them objectively worse
general 2023-03-27 11:09:35 oh and maybe something actually proper but that's rare
general 2023-03-27 11:11:24 speaking of janet, mj's song "scream" originally had a sample taken from her song "the knowledge"
general 2023-03-27 11:11:47 the album release of scream doesn't have it though
general 2023-03-27 11:12:12 luckily i've got the original mix assembled
general 2023-03-27 11:13:35 it's really hard to hear but it should be at 0:14
general 2023-03-27 11:15:49 it's at 2:48 here
general 2023-03-27 11:15:50 this is from the multitracks
general 2023-03-27 11:16:58 there are also 2 confirmed samples from "in the closet" present in the song, which is a track on dangerous
general 2023-03-27 11:25:04 https://youtu.be/okpNFceZidY?t=17 from this part of the original song
general 2023-03-27 11:25:33 i only like rhythm nation i can go without the rest of the album
general 2023-03-28 12:50:09 his arm colour
general 2023-03-28 12:50:45 that's the whole reason
general 2023-03-28 22:51:37 what happened to loop
general 2023-03-29 08:53:11 can confirm this is a real twitter moment
general 2023-03-29 08:53:28 terrible place apart from this one account
general 2023-03-29 09:42:16 why
general 2023-03-29 09:43:47 idk it just looked annoying to me
general 2023-03-29 09:52:56 oh yeah what's happened with pcc times btw? is it gone?
general 2023-03-29 09:53:35 well it's all up to you
general 2023-03-29 09:53:55 maybe
general 2023-03-29 10:01:16 it's been a thing for months
general 2023-03-29 11:42:48 of course
general 2023-03-29 11:42:55 it's pcc after all
general 2023-03-29 12:31:17 gacha game discussions
general 2023-03-29 12:32:50 obviously
general 2023-03-29 12:33:14 2bad samples wow
general 2023-03-29 12:33:31 i can't find the main drum loop
general 2023-03-29 12:33:56 nvm here it is
general 2023-03-29 12:34:17 
general 2023-03-29 12:35:34 
general 2023-03-29 12:35:46 can literally recreate 2bad with all of these
general 2023-03-29 12:36:15 most of 2bad's tracks are just percussion
general 2023-03-29 12:36:29 kind of makes sense with the story behind it
general 2023-03-29 12:37:32 look up the song "2 bad" by michael jackson
general 2023-03-29 12:37:37 there's your answer, this loop is there throughout some of the song
general 2023-03-29 12:38:22 and no, this isn't that "bad" everyone knows about, this one is on the HIStory album
general 2023-03-29 12:44:29 was just the base drum loop throughout the song in the initial phase, then more stuff kept getting added progressively cause everyone who worked on it would just listen whenever they added something new lol
general 2023-03-30 05:13:48 why
general 2023-03-30 11:57:21 should sequence 2bad sometime because why not
general 2023-03-30 11:57:26 i've got most samples
general 2023-03-30 11:57:39 
general 2023-03-30 12:06:20 z ant is so stupid honestly
general 2023-03-30 12:06:45 idk it makes no sense
general 2023-03-30 12:08:19 there's already all the multitracks and assembled stems but it'll be a great challenge to sequence it from scratch
general 2023-03-30 12:15:20 that dangerous sound, nothing like it beyond that album
general 2023-03-30 12:15:33 
general 2023-03-30 12:54:53 metallica is still making music? i'm so out of it honestly
general 2023-03-30 12:55:52 wow
general 2023-03-30 12:57:20 got a few funny files that may have come from a laptop incident
general 2023-03-30 12:57:51 an early version of "i can't help it" and the studio quality demo of "dangerous"
general 2023-03-30 12:58:24 the version before teddy riley stepped in and completely redid it
general 2023-03-30 12:59:29 more dna with streetwalker
general 2023-03-30 13:00:14 i know an emulator 3 was in the studio at the time of dangerous
general 2023-03-30 13:08:58 mhm
general 2023-03-30 13:09:02 changed user
general 2023-03-30 13:09:13 back to desired
general 2023-03-30 13:09:18 yeah
general 2023-03-30 13:09:31 lmao
general 2023-03-30 13:10:23 (i've literally never listened to a single song by metallica before)
general 2023-03-30 13:10:35 really hard to believe but it's true
general 2023-03-30 13:11:10 some element category idk
general 2023-03-30 13:14:07 currently listening to it rn

general 2023-03-30 13:16:42 oh wait that's the one game which actually fills out a real document lmao
general 2023-03-30 13:19:58 song was actually good
general 2023-03-30 13:22:12 i've got both the original and later censored version of HIStory in my files
general 2023-03-30 13:22:27 scream and they don't care about us were both censored
general 2023-03-30 13:23:08 title track used a clip from another song but was swapped out
general 2023-03-30 13:39:39 https://youtu.be/ALyDjinV-eU check this out
general 2023-03-30 13:40:41 sorry about it being so abrupt but it's the best dnb album i've listened to to date
general 2023-03-31 11:32:39 dumbest shit
general 2023-03-31 11:32:57 makes no sense

general 2023-03-31 12:15:36 me on my way to put gatekeeped files on slsk
general 2023-03-31 12:16:34 (may or may not be putting "the knowledge" multitracks on there)
general 2023-03-31 12:18:12 but seriously all the janet stuff is really hard to come by without doing extra stuff for the files (paying money)
general 2023-03-31 12:25:31 fuck clubremixer
general 2023-03-31 12:25:45 just bypass all their links with this admittedly slow service
general 2023-03-31 12:26:42 but it's working
general 2023-03-31 12:29:35 oh shit i should probably clone that 40gb mega archive i have of those
general 2023-04-01 07:53:12 early tracks from the "invincible" album got dropped 17 hours ago
general 2023-04-01 07:53:22 this isn't april fools, it's the real deal
general 2023-04-01 12:24:24 apparently all the early material from the "invincible" album that just got released today came from dat tapes
general 2023-04-01 12:26:39 there's also a cd out there that contains the track "get your weight off of me" so i'm hoping that gets leaked
general 2023-04-01 13:47:19 never visit mint's server
general 2023-04-01 13:47:23 terrible place
general 2023-04-01 13:47:41 fuck
general 2023-04-01 13:48:59 i'm in there but i never speak
general 2023-04-01 13:49:05 or really look at the server at all
general 2023-04-01 13:50:58 anyone can make invites for uh thing
general 2023-04-01 13:54:50 https://youtu.be/tXrreES0xLI
general 2023-04-01 13:55:11 mk2 and mk3 has the best shao kahn voice
general 2023-04-01 14:04:36 
general 2023-04-01 14:04:51 i can't find the toasty one
general 2023-04-01 14:18:55 it took me too long to find that reverse cymbal
general 2023-04-01 14:20:41 all i need is the midway presents sound and that's it
general 2023-04-01 14:22:58 
general 2023-04-01 14:23:06 i've done the raiden friendship in mk2 once
general 2023-04-01 14:33:42 a bit of mk2
general 2023-04-01 14:53:21 alright apparently i have mastered mk2
general 2023-04-02 03:09:25 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-04-02 03:09:36 no more quan chi
general 2023-04-02 03:12:52 someone should mod the graphics of mk2 so raiden has the supreme drip
general 2023-04-02 04:34:24 i mean it's good to keep an open mind and try new stuff out
general 2023-04-02 04:37:36 your tastes, not fact
general 2023-04-02 04:38:45 yeah i was just saying that as a general statement
general 2023-04-02 12:06:45 status so good
general 2023-04-02 14:41:56 hi yousuf
general 2023-04-02 14:44:23 how's everything going?
general 2023-04-02 14:54:48 this section of 2bad is just
general 2023-04-02 14:55:20 all the small additions to the loop just in one spot
general 2023-04-02 14:55:36 since that's the story about how it was composed
general 2023-04-02 14:56:05 that's good
general 2023-04-02 14:57:37 brian vibberts and the others who worked on 2bad would just crank up the loop in the studio and slowly add more parts to it after listening to it
general 2023-04-02 14:57:51 originally was just 9 minutes of just the drum loop
general 2023-04-02 14:58:29 (there are 76 separate tracks)
general 2023-04-02 15:01:55 kind of tempted to spread around the flac of the 2000 watts uncut session
general 2023-04-02 15:02:12 i've already put it up on slsk
general 2023-04-02 15:07:00 fuck it
general 2023-04-02 15:07:19 around 25 seconds longer than the original
general 2023-04-02 15:07:24 really rare to come across
general 2023-04-02 15:08:17 stuff from invincible isn't really talked about, not even the new demos
general 2023-04-02 15:09:44 the actual high quality demo of jungle city (direct recording) only has 700 views
general 2023-04-02 15:15:10 were you in there?
general 2023-04-02 15:15:23 what was your name before
general 2023-04-02 15:15:31 did you change your user?
general 2023-04-02 15:15:42 2020
general 2023-04-02 15:15:52 mid-late 2020
general 2023-04-02 15:16:04 does pcaua ring a bell
general 2023-04-02 15:16:39 i forgot the name of the initial one
general 2023-04-02 15:16:48 but there was plane crazy anti unde association
general 2023-04-02 15:16:51 it was so dumb
general 2023-04-02 15:17:03 was the first one called new inquisition?
general 2023-04-02 15:17:23 i'm probably getting it confused with vungi's other servers
general 2023-04-02 15:17:39 ok yeah i think it's that one then
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:18:03 oh shit
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:18:05 i've seen this
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:18:33 nothing that concerns you
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:18:40 all old stuff
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:18:48 yeah it's plane crazy anti unde association
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:19:11 this was made with info from the server
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:19:44 pretty sure yes
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:20:05 no
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:20:07 long gone
the-dump 2023-04-02 15:20:24 honestly yeah lmao
general 2023-04-02 15:21:02 falded were you in there?
general 2023-04-02 15:21:10 i don't remember
general 2023-04-02 15:21:12 ah ok
general 2023-04-02 15:21:19 for some reason i thought you were
general 2023-04-02 15:21:28 no
general 2023-04-02 15:21:40 pcaua was already so stupid
general 2023-04-02 15:21:46 we don't want another one
general 2023-04-02 15:23:39 https://youtu.be/TvOyAFNroD4 i don't like it but at least we have more of it in higher quality
general 2023-04-02 15:23:56 also this is the writer's demo - no mj vocals on it
general 2023-04-03 02:51:44 turned into c-mac
general 2023-04-03 02:52:01 from the kersal massive
general 2023-04-03 03:10:22 peace at last
general 2023-04-03 03:10:24 no more supreme drip raiden
general 2023-04-03 10:59:07 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/675609335371530247/1092402789130457178/-9l29GCpE81SNQwh.mp4
general 2023-04-03 10:59:38 i don’t know why i have this
general 2023-04-03 11:00:32 true
general 2023-04-03 11:00:36 only a year away
general 2023-04-03 12:20:38 i'm still on my journey for more janet multitracks other than rhythm nation
general 2023-04-03 12:22:48 
general 2023-04-03 12:22:50 the real deal
general 2023-04-03 12:24:00 100% sure the entire rhythm nation album used emu emax drums in some way
general 2023-04-03 13:00:22 fuckin hell it's so hard to get janet multis
general 2023-04-03 13:00:34 i'll just put my rhythm nation set on slsk
general 2023-04-03 13:00:49 lucky enough just to have that
general 2023-04-03 13:43:43 and smooth criminal's bass sound is actually triple layered
general 2023-04-03 13:52:47 more "invincible" album demo leaks later this week hopefully
general 2023-04-03 13:52:53 i want gywoom
general 2023-04-03 13:53:36 there are recreations but nothing like the real deal
general 2023-04-03 13:54:20 oh hi hyper
general 2023-04-03 13:54:27 haven't seen you around in a while
general 2023-04-04 05:53:46 got those clips of the walmart streams
general 2023-04-04 05:53:50 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092597374607695912/1092680547630846074/FORKLIFT_769751730.mp4
general 2023-04-04 05:56:57 best part of twitter is daily pictures of quan chi from the mk4 arcade cabinet
general 2023-04-04 05:57:08 honestly best account on the platform
general 2023-04-04 05:57:19 including that guy who always comments woolay on each image
general 2023-04-04 06:07:58 hold on i have ideas
general 2023-04-04 06:14:18 new categories
general 2023-04-04 06:15:19 yeah
general 2023-04-04 06:15:29 nah it's the hierarchy
general 2023-04-04 10:19:52 i really want to get the pop up special edition of the dangerous album
general 2023-04-04 10:20:15 i already own an original copy of dangerous but i want that pop up version cause there's nothing else like it
general 2023-04-04 10:34:21 like holy shit it even comes with a large version of the album art underneath the cd tray
general 2023-04-04 10:34:46 gold cd instead of the regular black one
general 2023-04-04 10:36:16 if anything like this was ever done with HIStory it probably would've been great
general 2023-04-04 10:59:06 oh yeah what's going on? i'm so out of the loop
general 2023-04-04 11:08:56 how much longer until you can change back
general 2023-04-04 11:18:11 mhm
general 2023-04-04 11:18:27 this is why i'm in better servers now
general 2023-04-05 09:36:50 blood on the dance floor's backing track
general 2023-04-05 09:36:58 it literally came like this with the multitracks
general 2023-04-05 09:37:39 real shame it isn't in separate tracks
general 2023-04-05 09:50:30 finally
general 2023-04-05 09:53:05 i'm kind of thinking this might be lifted from the original 1991 version of botdf
general 2023-04-05 09:53:23 heard somewhere that they weren't given multitracks so they just edited what they had
general 2023-04-05 09:53:43 i think it was in one of the official in the studio with mj interviews
general 2023-04-05 09:54:42 also it literally screams "dangerous era"
general 2023-04-05 10:22:21 things can change
general 2023-04-05 10:22:25 it was better than this before
general 2023-04-05 10:27:30 could say they aren't allowed to disclose anything, but there's obviously bound to be at least 1 person that says something about it
general 2023-04-05 10:27:55 yeah i'm convinced that nothing happened of it
general 2023-04-05 10:32:03 https://www.youtube.com/live/EMz8I9YvEuw?feature=share full stream vod of the 3rd walmart stream
general 2023-04-05 10:32:22 it's 12 hours long btw
general 2023-04-06 10:49:52 ordered my copy of HIStory
general 2023-04-06 10:51:46 it's the original silver discs version that was initially released over here
general 2023-04-06 10:55:00 botdf or the pop up dangerous album is next on my list
general 2023-04-06 10:55:49 and maybe thriller 40
general 2023-04-06 11:01:13 fuck the remixes on botdf except the scream one
general 2023-04-06 11:01:20 that one is actually alright
general 2023-04-06 11:01:54 plus it uses the sample from janet jackson's "the knowledge", which was cut out from the regular version
general 2023-04-07 01:31:20 4 years of development hell
general 2023-04-07 01:31:27 holy shit
general 2023-04-07 09:57:25 the unrhythm cover art (official)
general 2023-04-07 09:57:33 reflects the song perfectly
general 2023-04-07 11:11:12 regular plane crazy was also developed by a single dev before rickje took over
general 2023-04-07 11:11:57 not really
general 2023-04-07 11:12:26 fair
general 2023-04-07 11:16:42 hfw is a triple a game
general 2023-04-07 11:16:46 pc2 is roblox
general 2023-04-07 11:17:39 plus being built on the hzd engine, which gave it a head start
general 2023-04-07 11:18:15 hzd took 6 years to develop
general 2023-04-07 11:22:22 lmao true
general 2023-04-07 11:22:34 4 years for a roblox game is beyond absurd
general 2023-04-07 11:22:49 and he supposedly has a team
general 2023-04-07 11:23:13 exactly
general 2023-04-07 11:23:35 we don't even know if he actually has one or is providing a false sense of hope
general 2023-04-07 11:43:24 3 british guys made the starfox 3d engine in the span of a bit more than a year
general 2023-04-07 11:43:35 with superfx code and assembly
general 2023-04-07 11:48:04 i don't know shit about programming but i can gather that hard coded means that certain aspects of the game are not flexible at all
general 2023-04-07 11:48:49 i've made something hard coded by setting a program to extract at 2 certain offsets with options for choosing one or the other
general 2023-04-07 11:49:35 basically, hard coded = bad for game longevity
general 2023-04-07 11:50:26 mild coded lmao
general 2023-04-07 11:59:27 i've almost gone a full day without sleeping once
general 2023-04-07 11:59:30 for some reason
general 2023-04-07 12:03:49 like a day
general 2023-04-07 12:04:07 idk why i said a full day that was pretty stupid
general 2023-04-07 12:04:09 but yeah
general 2023-04-07 12:04:45 i don't know
general 2023-04-07 12:04:52 i just couldn't sleep
general 2023-04-07 12:05:37 i don't even remember what i was doing
general 2023-04-07 12:06:31 wdym
general 2023-04-07 12:12:41 i don't know
general 2023-04-07 12:12:44 sorry
general 2023-04-07 13:31:13 there is a 3rd raiden
general 2023-04-07 13:32:39 https://tenor.com/view/mortal-kombat-electricity-gif-9746802
general 2023-04-07 13:32:44 this is the 3rd raiden
general 2023-04-08 08:43:18 getting closer to the proper version on the album
general 2023-04-08 09:53:50 the mj server has image perms at level 5 and it really isn't bad at all
general 2023-04-08 09:54:05 plus levels take longer to earn there
general 2023-04-08 09:55:22 i prefer games that aren't about constant grinding
general 2023-04-08 09:56:23 yeah it's a real shame
general 2023-04-08 09:56:43 not even that long ago things were better
general 2023-04-08 10:00:49 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1002355565881725108/1081130986407997460/Dolphin_2023-03-03_19-25-17.mp4 this is a wii game from 2009 running in dolphin, it wasn't even a good game when it released yet i still had fun with it
general 2023-04-08 10:01:50 xbox game bar made it look choppy it's actually full 60fps on real hardware and on emulator
general 2023-04-08 10:02:05 2009 isn't that old
general 2023-04-08 10:04:26 i've never liked fps games
general 2023-04-08 10:06:13 i mean i don't really find stuff being released now all that appealing
general 2023-04-08 10:06:36 i really enjoyed horizon forbidden west though and that was about it
general 2023-04-08 10:08:16 this is where emulation comes in
general 2023-04-08 10:08:34 but it's a mac so there isn't really many options lol
general 2023-04-08 10:10:07 i've never played a halo game
general 2023-04-08 10:12:26 i've seen the metroid prime remaster
general 2023-04-08 10:12:32 looks really good
general 2023-04-08 10:13:12 early ipads are tanks tbh
general 2023-04-08 10:13:57 my ipad air 2 has never gotten a cracked screen
general 2023-04-08 10:14:22 after like 6 years of consistent usage
general 2023-04-08 10:15:22 and it's still using the original battery
general 2023-04-08 10:23:14 i've got one of the ipad pros but i never use it
general 2023-04-08 10:23:23 my air 2 has been through a lot
general 2023-04-08 10:23:44 wtf it's up to 5?
general 2023-04-08 10:24:34 oh yeah standard discord filesize limit has been raised to 25mb
general 2023-04-08 10:24:44 about time
general 2023-04-08 10:25:09 i think yesterday or today lol
general 2023-04-08 10:25:21 probably yesterday
general 2023-04-08 10:28:37 nope lol
general 2023-04-08 10:29:32 yeah
general 2023-04-08 10:29:52 original half life never looked appealing to me
general 2023-04-08 10:30:19 yeah ik but idk
general 2023-04-08 10:30:57 doesn't look like something i'd enjoy
general 2023-04-08 10:32:34 i just look at stuff on my own
general 2023-04-08 10:32:44 if it looks appealing then i'll try it out
general 2023-04-08 10:35:00 one thing i'm sure of is that i don't like fps games
general 2023-04-08 10:46:21 can't wait to get my copy of HIStory
general 2023-04-08 13:28:13 original mix of history, kind of rare to come across since it was on the first few versions of the album
general 2023-04-08 13:28:52 4 seconds shorter than the version in the later pressings
general 2023-04-08 13:29:56 there's no changes with stranger in moscow i just like the song
general 2023-04-08 13:44:51 you upload your own
general 2023-04-08 13:46:01 oh yeah fuck i forgot
general 2023-04-08 13:46:15 actually wait
general 2023-04-08 13:46:26 no your own audio works
general 2023-04-08 13:46:36 even if it's more than 6 seconds
general 2023-04-08 13:46:58 i remember i uploaded the hornet's engine from daytona usa (over 6 seconds) and it played fine
general 2023-04-08 13:47:10 even after the purge
general 2023-04-08 13:47:36 yeah i think
general 2023-04-08 13:47:46 it's been a long time so idk if i'm actually right
general 2023-04-08 15:07:58 tbh it's fucked that there's game name censorship
general 2023-04-08 15:08:17 yeah probably
general 2023-04-08 15:22:21 i don't play plane crazy anymore sorry
general 2023-04-08 15:22:45 i haven't played properly since 2020 or 2021, and i was shit at the game back then so
general 2023-04-08 15:23:53 thank you for asking though
general 2023-04-09 05:40:42 fuck it, entire early mix of jam
general 2023-04-09 05:40:43 with the alternate rap segment
general 2023-04-09 05:43:41 bubbington is cool though so it can be excused
general 2023-04-09 06:45:42 hi septagin
general 2023-04-09 11:03:47 the highest quality jamiroquai rips
general 2023-04-09 11:03:59 i have never heard of jamiroquai before
general 2023-04-09 11:04:22 no this is furniture insanity
general 2023-04-09 11:04:24 different song
general 2023-04-09 11:04:43 some guy
general 2023-04-09 11:04:48 he rearranges furniture
general 2023-04-09 11:05:28 damn that's nice
general 2023-04-09 11:06:25 you can buy the heavier from marketplace
general 2023-04-09 11:07:02 
general 2023-04-09 11:07:41 wtf
general 2023-04-09 11:08:59 that's really good
general 2023-04-09 11:11:12 top is in great shape
general 2023-04-09 11:11:19 as well as the screens
general 2023-04-09 11:12:07 yeah it should clean up
general 2023-04-09 11:12:23 bottom is in worse shape but that's expected
general 2023-04-09 11:19:20 <@370594904268734464> i bought a sealed copy of michael jackson's history album
general 2023-04-09 11:19:43 original 1995 release but the silver disc release
general 2023-04-09 11:20:25 might get the gold cd one later cause it has the uncensored version of they don't care about us and the original mix of history
general 2023-04-09 11:27:53 idk but i can't find any other sealed copies of the fatbox silver discs version
general 2023-04-09 11:30:39 oh <@370594904268734464> there's a copy of the silver discs version on discogs that's like new but not sealed going for $52.75 aud
general 2023-04-09 11:36:24 what i'm really looking at atm is the collector's edition pop up dangerous album
general 2023-04-09 11:44:28 idc about the value though i'm just gonna open it and use it lmao
general 2023-04-09 11:45:48 yeah i'm not like that
general 2023-04-09 11:45:58 i just like having things in good condition
general 2023-04-09 11:46:46 not heavily scratched jewel case or anything, i'm fine with a few scratches
general 2023-04-09 12:18:49 <@370594904268734464> i'm buying a sealed uncensored copy of history
general 2023-04-09 12:20:25 turns out all the australian releases are the censored version but this one is the canadian release
general 2023-04-09 12:20:47 it's in australia though, most likely an import copy
general 2023-04-09 12:33:53 cheap as well, only 17 bucks
general 2023-04-09 12:36:08 so now i've got 2 copies of history on the way lmao
general 2023-04-09 12:37:04 i know what i'm getting since i've crosschecked with discogs, extremely good site when it comes to variants
general 2023-04-09 13:14:31 
general 2023-04-09 13:14:43 michelangelo johannesburg on top
general 2023-04-09 23:26:41 this is false
general 2023-04-09 23:26:57 to talk with people
general 2023-04-09 23:27:14 also i'm not even active here anymore, moved to other servers
general 2023-04-09 23:28:47 there's no denying wt is a shitty grindfest
general 2023-04-09 23:29:06 but people can enjoy stuff nonetheless
general 2023-04-09 23:30:07 it's just that i'm really opposed to grinding in games and p2w stuff
general 2023-04-09 23:34:16 sonic 1, 2 and cd are also free on mobile
general 2023-04-09 23:34:41 with widescreen
general 2023-04-09 23:35:03 i don't touch those
general 2023-04-09 23:35:06 those are shit
general 2023-04-09 23:35:27 if you know where to look mortal kombat 2 is also free
general 2023-04-09 23:40:31 i once got to 8 wins in a row
general 2023-04-09 23:46:04 banger
general 2023-04-10 00:24:01 textures:
general 2023-04-10 00:24:29 just the image part, like how the old games did it
general 2023-04-10 00:24:52 this is about games
general 2023-04-10 00:25:04 the actual texture part is separate from the image
general 2023-04-10 06:28:55 picked up some stuff
general 2023-04-10 06:29:11 don’t mind dangerous i already had it before
general 2023-04-10 06:29:34 nice
general 2023-04-10 06:30:14 bad is obv a repress
general 2023-04-10 06:30:34 cds from that era looked more like my copy of dangerous
general 2023-04-10 06:30:36 yeah
general 2023-04-10 06:30:40 i bought them new
general 2023-04-10 06:31:00 thriller 40 and bad
general 2023-04-10 06:31:12 true but i’m listening to them now
general 2023-04-10 06:31:57 yeah my dangerous is an original 1991 pressing
general 2023-04-10 06:32:16 this is true
general 2023-04-10 06:32:54 ofc i’m waiting for my copies of HIStory
general 2023-04-10 06:37:18 <@370594904268734464> the copy of HIStory i ordered has the hype sticker on the front, none of the represses have them
general 2023-04-10 06:37:44 next on my list on stuff to get is HIStory in the mix
general 2023-04-10 06:37:58 the botdf album
general 2023-04-10 06:38:30 i look for that because those copies have the uncensored original mixes
general 2023-04-10 06:39:05 was controversy surrounding the lyrics in they don’t care about us
general 2023-04-10 06:39:16 but what i really want is the pop up dangerous album
general 2023-04-10 06:39:26 they aren’t cheap
general 2023-04-10 06:40:51 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855612183110221826/1092764360851587152/NS00OTQ3LmpwZWc.png like this looks so good
general 2023-04-10 06:41:01 gold cd instead of the regular black one
general 2023-04-10 06:41:30 yeah that’s actually the inspiration behind the cover art
general 2023-04-10 06:41:52 macaulay culkin is in one of the rides
general 2023-04-10 06:43:09 dangerous is the best mj cover art tbh
general 2023-04-10 06:43:57 HIStory’s cover art actually uses a real prop made specifically for the cover
general 2023-04-10 06:44:43 that statue was actually made and it’s lifesize iirc
general 2023-04-10 06:45:26 well not as big as a statue but it was modelled to be similar to mj’s height
general 2023-04-10 07:37:14 <@370594904268734464> ordered blood on the dance floor, original 97 release but opened
general 2023-04-10 09:13:41 bluestacks adware
general 2023-04-10 09:13:55 yes i do love my emulators to be like utorrent
general 2023-04-10 09:14:10 fuck bluestacks
general 2023-04-10 09:16:36 i don't use it anymore because first of all it uses a lot of storage and is bloated, secondly i don't want to see a huge ad everytime i open it
general 2023-04-10 09:18:32 good
general 2023-04-10 09:19:07 yes there are people who actually read stuff before they jump right into it
general 2023-04-10 09:20:52 those people are the ones that actually read the readme files
general 2023-04-10 09:28:38 
general 2023-04-10 09:29:03 actually really good game
general 2023-04-10 09:29:15 mk2 is the peak of the classic mk games
general 2023-04-10 09:29:34 night don't
general 2023-04-10 09:30:00 how about no mobile anime girls
general 2023-04-10 09:31:26 i know all of scorpion's moveset
general 2023-04-10 09:33:35 i wonder if they made an actual plush based off the mk2 scorpion design
general 2023-04-10 09:33:40 that'd be cool
general 2023-04-10 09:37:38 up to 8 wins
general 2023-04-10 09:38:57 the snes version?
general 2023-04-10 09:39:06 one of the worst ways to play mk2
general 2023-04-10 09:39:13 arcade all the way
general 2023-04-10 09:39:28 still a good port for the time though
general 2023-04-10 09:41:01 the source code leak that happened last year is what got me into playing classic mk games
general 2023-04-10 09:56:51 that double mk2 logo
general 2023-04-10 09:56:54 i'm almost there
general 2023-04-10 09:57:07 the 1 credit run
general 2023-04-10 10:01:41 the final fight
general 2023-04-10 10:10:56 and i'm finished
general 2023-04-10 10:28:10 roblox is such a shitty platform
general 2023-04-10 10:29:08 i find i have more fun doing audio stuff
general 2023-04-10 10:30:52 i've got a whole list of mj multitracks i want
general 2023-04-10 10:31:35 why you wanna trip on me and tabloid junkie are included on that list
general 2023-04-10 10:32:39 i usually just call it trip though since that's what the people who worked on dangerous called it
general 2023-04-10 10:51:04 you rock my world is one of the actual good songs on invincible
general 2023-04-10 10:51:30 can't believe i overlooked it
general 2023-04-10 10:52:42 the rare uncut session of 2000 watts
general 2023-04-10 10:52:50 increased wattage
general 2023-04-10 10:53:17 such a stupid song
general 2023-04-10 10:53:18 i mean good
general 2023-04-10 10:53:24 not even scientifically accurate
general 2023-04-10 10:54:46 200 volts and 8 ohms equal to 25 amps
general 2023-04-10 10:54:59 25 amps x 200 volts is 5000 watts
general 2023-04-10 10:55:04 not 2000 watts
general 2023-04-10 10:56:24 idk blame some random guy on a forum which made a long post about this
general 2023-04-10 10:57:43 and mr jaycar man for going really in depth
general 2023-04-10 10:58:53 spreading around the increased wattage again
general 2023-04-10 12:35:30 
general 2023-04-10 12:35:31 the jamiroquai rip
general 2023-04-10 12:35:43 gets interesting at 1:07
general 2023-04-10 12:36:03 wtf
general 2023-04-10 12:36:08 you're dirty minded
general 2023-04-10 12:36:14 no the chorus is different
general 2023-04-10 14:29:08 nice
general 2023-04-10 14:29:14 what was the issue?
general 2023-04-10 14:33:45 i just realised the music video version of blood on the dance floor hasn't been officially released
general 2023-04-10 14:34:55 lmao
general 2023-04-10 14:35:00 at least you got it done
general 2023-04-10 14:35:35 for some reason the backing track is panned left??
general 2023-04-10 14:38:02 also there's a pause after the chorus the first time
general 2023-04-10 14:38:38 it's not like moonwalker smooth criminal which is 7 minutes long
general 2023-04-10 14:42:57 i did try to get all the volume levels sort of similar with the multitracks
general 2023-04-10 14:43:26 i think the backing track was lifted straight from the original demo for the dangerous album
general 2023-04-10 14:53:35 wait i can probably recreate it
general 2023-04-10 15:03:46 and so it starts
general 2023-04-10 15:04:13 fuck yeah
general 2023-04-10 15:04:28 settings
general 2023-04-10 15:05:18 edit -> preferences -> interface
general 2023-04-10 15:05:33 
general 2023-04-10 16:10:31 
general 2023-04-10 16:11:26 music video exclusive pause is at 1:52
general 2023-04-10 16:11:37 and i fixed the panning on that too
general 2023-04-10 16:25:35 botdf is fuckin great
general 2023-04-10 16:26:13 i can't mix for the life of me so the best version of the song is the one on the album
general 2023-04-10 16:28:41 was originally for dangerous but got released 6 years later
general 2023-04-11 01:14:18 fixed track timings
general 2023-04-11 01:14:38 somehow i messed up spacing the tracks last time
general 2023-04-11 01:17:29 the multitracks
general 2023-04-11 01:17:37 original studio recordings
general 2023-04-11 01:17:46 i don't know how these get out
general 2023-04-11 01:18:43 but botdf's multis are for the album version so i added back the pause from the music video
general 2023-04-11 01:22:47 i could've did it with the final mixed version but that's no fun
general 2023-04-11 01:23:09 also it's in multitrack format so i can remove channels and stuff
general 2023-04-11 01:23:35 so there's now an instrumental of the music video version
general 2023-04-11 02:01:41 no
general 2023-04-11 05:27:55 we don't want gammarad back
general 2023-04-11 05:28:03 he's actually racist
general 2023-04-11 05:28:34 because he is
general 2023-04-11 05:28:43 why else has he not been unbanned yet
general 2023-04-11 05:28:49 oh no there's more than the plane
general 2023-04-11 05:31:44 nsfw infractions
general 2023-04-11 05:32:10 at least that's what i remember
general 2023-04-11 05:32:16 i might be wrong idk
general 2023-04-11 05:32:45 no he's still here
general 2023-04-11 05:33:18 night just changed his name
general 2023-04-11 05:36:13 woo my copy of blood on the dance floor got sent out
general 2023-04-11 09:12:22 never touch bad 25
general 2023-04-11 09:12:28 they ruined the mixes
general 2023-04-11 10:23:35 damn the actual cd release sounds better than the flac files somehow
general 2023-04-11 10:50:40 hi yousuf
general 2023-04-11 11:11:36 so true
general 2023-04-11 11:22:53 vungi don’t worry that ship is made of francium
general 2023-04-11 11:23:05 it will never work
general 2023-04-11 11:32:24 didn't expect to see you here
general 2023-04-11 11:38:59 trying to get panning correct
general 2023-04-11 11:39:10 music video is panned to the left for some reason
general 2023-04-11 11:50:42 45% right panning is good enough i guess
general 2023-04-11 11:53:17 another update
general 2023-04-11 11:54:47 botdf really does have a lot in common with the stuff on dangerous since it was an unreleased track on dangerous
general 2023-04-11 11:55:05 even after the slight rework
general 2023-04-11 12:48:01 the whole point of pc2 is to actually make it easier for future updates
general 2023-04-11 12:49:38 yeah falded it's not worth it
general 2023-04-11 12:58:44 i saw that clip
general 2023-04-11 12:59:37 and then when mj allegedly does stuff he's flamed to this very day
general 2023-04-11 12:59:48 mj is innocent
general 2023-04-11 13:40:34 send this to rick
general 2023-04-12 10:33:04 oh yeah, i remember this song from the fight at las vegas
general 2023-04-12 10:33:12 but why does the audio quality sound shit
general 2023-04-12 10:37:27 kind of forgot there was a tideripper fight in that one cauldron
general 2023-04-12 13:08:52 no way it's olihere
general 2023-04-12 13:09:25 nice
general 2023-04-12 13:38:55 how dare they
general 2023-04-12 13:44:47 what
general 2023-04-12 13:44:52 that's the character though
general 2023-04-12 13:45:01 the violet haired one
general 2023-04-12 13:45:46 so anyway where is the other girl (can't say her name)
general 2023-04-12 13:48:09 she needs it
general 2023-04-12 13:49:15 true
general 2023-04-12 13:51:41 nah actually nvm it's more fitting for monika
general 2023-04-12 13:52:10 nah
general 2023-04-12 13:52:25 the girl i can't say the name of did
general 2023-04-12 13:52:36 the one at the mental health institute
general 2023-04-12 13:53:05 cutting problem + obsessive nature
general 2023-04-12 13:53:40 only got worse when the tampering started
general 2023-04-12 13:54:27 natsuki is abused at home
general 2023-04-12 13:54:48 first thing i did tbh lmao
general 2023-04-12 13:55:00 got monika's chr file and opened it in a hex editor
general 2023-04-12 13:55:07 saw it had the png header
general 2023-04-12 13:57:23 there's no game like ddlc, the way it messes with the game files and makes files of its own really caught me off guard when i played it
general 2023-04-12 13:57:44 i knew about the psychological horror stuff which is why i went to check it out but not about that
general 2023-04-12 13:59:03 i agree
general 2023-04-12 14:02:00 mfs in 2001 when 2000 watts dropped
general 2023-04-12 14:13:45 https://tenor.com/view/michael-jackson-jam-basketball-gif-26497003
general 2023-04-12 14:18:48 was one of the .chr files just encoded text
general 2023-04-12 14:18:50 i forgot
general 2023-04-12 16:23:34 https://tenor.com/view/games-videogames-mortal-kombat-dance-party-dancing-gif-4753620
general 2023-04-13 03:12:21 the pack for the leave me alone multis were apparently streamed through instagram
general 2023-04-13 03:12:28 quality so high
general 2023-04-13 03:12:50 idk what that thing at the start is about
general 2023-04-13 03:12:52 it came like this
general 2023-04-13 03:13:20 made no changes to the arrangement, just imported the tracks into audacity
general 2023-04-13 03:13:49 i think the vocals are the most intact here
general 2023-04-13 03:13:53 bass got mangled
general 2023-04-13 03:14:32 as well as the drums
general 2023-04-13 03:15:05 yesterday
general 2023-04-13 03:16:55 stream packs
general 2023-04-13 03:17:00 absolute peak quality
general 2023-04-13 03:17:09 speed demon one is actually not that bad
general 2023-04-13 03:21:27 no
general 2023-04-13 03:21:37 i like looking at how these were made
general 2023-04-13 03:24:46 apom is sped up for some reason
general 2023-04-13 03:30:35 these stream packs aren't great quality at all, the original studio multitracks for the original mix of smooth criminal have been out there for a while and it actually sounds alright even though it isn't mixed at all
general 2023-04-13 03:30:50 actually starts at 0:18
general 2023-04-13 03:39:27 the quality of the intro got murdered
general 2023-04-13 03:42:01 i don't know if this is better or worse than the leave me alone pack
general 2023-04-13 03:43:23 i'm leaning towards better
general 2023-04-13 04:01:48 https://youtu.be/S0LWySA7W_0 someone has actually made usable stuff with the pack so that's how you know
general 2023-04-13 04:01:58 and it actually sounds good
general 2023-04-13 04:20:14 scream has a lot of sampled shit
general 2023-04-13 04:20:48 also these are leaked files lmao
general 2023-04-13 04:20:52 combine these 2 and you get the full percussion track
general 2023-04-13 04:21:20 not the flyte tyme remix, the full original mix
general 2023-04-13 05:24:41 another part of me bass
general 2023-04-13 05:24:45 from the dx7
general 2023-04-13 05:38:54 i should buy the invincible album
general 2023-04-13 05:43:50 woah wtf there's different colours?
general 2023-04-13 05:44:04 didn't know about that
general 2023-04-13 05:45:27 omw to get all the colour variants of invincible
general 2023-04-13 05:45:58 not a fan of phonk at all
general 2023-04-13 05:46:45 we don't care sorry
general 2023-04-13 06:16:56 i don't remember how i got this
general 2023-04-13 06:17:43 it might be a future records cd leak but idk
general 2023-04-13 06:17:53 i don't do that stuff
general 2023-04-13 06:18:46 got the final mix here
general 2023-04-13 06:19:18 dangerous has a bunch of underrated songs tbh
general 2023-04-13 06:24:08 entire high quality early dangerous demo
general 2023-04-13 06:24:23 before teddy riley went and redid the entire song
general 2023-04-13 12:26:14 because he wanted to
general 2023-04-13 13:50:20 lmao

general 2023-04-14 01:51:58 i should recreate the early dangerous tracklist
general 2023-04-14 01:52:01 i did
general 2023-04-14 01:52:36 the one with botdf
general 2023-04-14 03:09:55 laptop leak was wild
general 2023-04-14 03:10:07 this is a writer's demo, no actual mj vocals
general 2023-04-14 03:10:52 fuck it full lossless
general 2023-04-14 03:13:38 sadly chicago 1945 is too big for discord
general 2023-04-14 03:14:26 actually yeah idk about that song
general 2023-04-14 03:14:31 it's ok i guess
general 2023-04-14 05:59:28 wow hi darkz
general 2023-04-14 06:00:24 darkz is cool
general 2023-04-14 06:06:16 <@370594904268734464> got it
general 2023-04-14 06:06:20 somehow before history
general 2023-04-14 06:06:35 mhm
general 2023-04-14 06:07:03 only first 5 songs are worth listening to (his original intention)
general 2023-04-14 06:07:12 oh and the scream remix is good
general 2023-04-14 06:07:19 blood on the dance floor
general 2023-04-14 06:07:20 morphine
general 2023-04-14 06:07:25 superfly sister
general 2023-04-14 06:07:28 ghosts
general 2023-04-14 06:07:33 is it scary
general 2023-04-14 06:07:56 this was sony's idea (michael didn't want any remixes)
general 2023-04-14 06:08:10 originally just wanted to release an ep with just those 5 songs
general 2023-04-14 06:08:47 blood on the dance floor is really good
general 2023-04-14 06:08:51 unreleased on dangerous
general 2023-04-14 06:09:12 
general 2023-04-14 06:10:13 listening to bad rn
general 2023-04-14 06:10:22 leave me alone is one of the best songs on there ngl
general 2023-04-14 06:11:22 yes
general 2023-04-14 06:11:25 thriller 40
general 2023-04-14 06:11:49 old since i’ve got botdf now
general 2023-04-14 06:12:20 dangerous is his best album imo
general 2023-04-14 06:12:46 i’m waiting on 2 copies of history
general 2023-04-14 06:13:22 human nature is my favourite from thriller ngl
general 2023-04-14 06:13:58 on bad i would say smooth criminal but the album version isn't as good as the original
general 2023-04-14 06:14:24 so then probably speed demon or leave me alone
general 2023-04-14 06:15:02 https://youtu.be/zmQdzF-6zVw best mix of the original around
general 2023-04-14 06:15:17 there has been no official release apart from the music video
general 2023-04-14 06:15:24 but the multitracks leaked
general 2023-04-14 06:15:52 this was the intended version of smooth criminal
general 2023-04-14 06:16:02 it was always meant to be like this
general 2023-04-14 06:17:03 this is using the leaked multitracks
general 2023-04-14 06:17:10 and original recording speed
general 2023-04-14 06:17:22 was sped up for the music video and album
general 2023-04-14 06:17:39 also this exists
general 2023-04-14 06:18:08 got leaked early this year
general 2023-04-14 06:18:18 with a bunch of other stuff too
general 2023-04-14 06:19:08 it is
general 2023-04-14 06:19:25 idk from when but it's from the in the studio with mj seminars
general 2023-04-14 06:19:32 and it's not the full thing
general 2023-04-14 06:19:49 another thing from bad that got leaked
general 2023-04-14 06:20:08 it's a miracle this thing even survived
general 2023-04-14 06:20:17 most of the stuff from the bad sessions are lost
general 2023-04-14 06:20:34 the story behind how this stuff leaked is wild
general 2023-04-14 06:21:12 took brad sundberg's laptop and an ssd, jumped out of a window and ran across a roof
general 2023-04-14 06:21:31 it's really hard to believe
general 2023-04-14 06:21:39 but the man himself broke the news
general 2023-04-14 06:22:29 some of this stuff is degrading so we're lucky we even have this
general 2023-04-14 06:22:41 the full grammy mix of twymmf
general 2023-04-14 06:24:09 bunch of videos leaked too
general 2023-04-14 06:24:10 https://youtu.be/Mu5pPVWqWXE
general 2023-04-14 06:24:49 there's a couple for tracks on the dangerous album
general 2023-04-14 06:25:11 jam, she drives me wild, and will you be there
general 2023-04-14 06:25:51 and a video of deciding the dangerous tracklist
general 2023-04-14 06:25:55 has an earlier draft of it
general 2023-04-14 06:26:20 (blood on the dance floor and someone put your hand out were meant to be on it)
general 2023-04-14 06:26:59 https://youtu.be/ncknokgmP5c?t=54
general 2023-04-14 06:27:19 i can recreate this draft version
general 2023-04-14 06:27:37 but botdf would be the revised version
general 2023-04-14 06:28:25 this has been really great for me since i get to see how some of these songs were made
general 2023-04-14 06:28:36 there's a mega folder with a bunch of multitrack packs
general 2023-04-14 06:29:30 little bit of the folder
general 2023-04-14 06:30:03 how people have gotten multitrack sessions for demos goes beyond me
general 2023-04-14 06:31:21 there's basically nothing from the invincible album made public
general 2023-04-14 06:31:29 except the vocal tracks from privacy
general 2023-04-14 06:31:48 yeah there aren't any multitracks for any song on invincible
general 2023-04-14 06:32:50 
general 2023-04-14 06:33:08 moonwalker version is divided into 3 parts
general 2023-04-14 06:34:53 my aup3s for the moonwalker version are just a bit big
general 2023-04-14 06:35:43 if you ever wanted the 2nd half of the moonwalker version with only the percussion and the bass
general 2023-04-14 06:35:58 starts at 0:18
general 2023-04-14 06:36:15 yeah
general 2023-04-14 06:36:48 also got the regular ones but they aren't any good because i just look at these for fun
general 2023-04-14 06:36:56 i can't mix for the life of me
general 2023-04-14 06:38:16 this was already premixed in the leak but it's the full 7 minute version of 2 bad
general 2023-04-14 06:39:00 there's a lot in this
general 2023-04-14 06:40:50 i think the most invincible stuff that has leaked is actually the snippets of get your weight off of me
general 2023-04-14 06:41:47 and the jungle city writer's demo, which only got shown not long ago
general 2023-04-14 06:48:18 https://youtu.be/AwT2Zcb4ulg
general 2023-04-14 06:48:49 there is a gold cd out there with the 2004 remaster of it
general 2023-04-14 06:49:52 apparently some of these are recreations but i can't find the actual full legit video anymore
general 2023-04-14 06:49:58 think it got taken down
general 2023-04-14 11:10:35 i am done with the original track order of dangerous
general 2023-04-14 11:10:43 really only 2 things different
general 2023-04-14 11:32:24 idk why it took me so long to finally download this
general 2023-04-14 11:32:47 sadly no flac of it
general 2023-04-14 11:33:17 oh hi koy
general 2023-04-14 11:36:11 i've actually been good
general 2023-04-14 11:36:38 wbu
general 2023-04-14 11:38:39 damn
general 2023-04-14 11:38:43 really good sign
general 2023-04-14 11:42:18 it's wild to think that slave to the rhythm was a dangerous era track
general 2023-04-14 11:42:24 sounds more like invincible to me
general 2023-04-14 11:54:48 mr 4chan himself
general 2023-04-14 13:00:36 still can't believe slave to the rhythm was from the dangerous sessions holy shit
general 2023-04-14 13:01:14 sounds like nothing on dangerous except maybe a little bit of botdf but that was 97
general 2023-04-14 13:01:28 it's more of an invincible styled song imo
general 2023-04-14 13:01:29 hi
general 2023-04-14 13:10:05 the easy warns
general 2023-04-14 13:45:20 i think fuzzy forgot a few things
general 2023-04-14 13:47:16 i don't even know what's going on
general 2023-04-14 13:48:10 why would that be allowed
general 2023-04-14 13:48:54 it's effectively just bypassing
general 2023-04-14 13:58:26 obviously it means you're gonna release an album called that
general 2023-04-14 14:47:18 moved on
general 2023-04-15 02:30:03 about time
general 2023-04-15 03:05:35 overreliance on caffiene
general 2023-04-15 03:06:42 i don't drink coffee
general 2023-04-15 03:06:54 nice
general 2023-04-15 03:08:30 no
general 2023-04-15 03:10:48 
general 2023-04-15 03:11:06 i'm still surprised this leaked out
general 2023-04-15 03:11:27 waiting on those 20 mixes of jam that are known to exist
general 2023-04-15 03:15:46 i don't know the source of this
general 2023-04-15 03:15:58 could be another one from the future records cds
general 2023-04-15 03:16:43 best album mj has ever done is dangerous ngl
general 2023-04-15 03:16:45 or bad
general 2023-04-15 03:16:49 one of those 2
general 2023-04-15 03:18:58 still waiting on my 2 copies of history
general 2023-04-15 03:19:09 i hope one of them is the uncensored version
general 2023-04-15 03:36:30 felt like sampling
general 2023-04-15 03:37:15 hell yeah
general 2023-04-15 03:37:18 lossless all the way
general 2023-04-15 03:40:44 when i tried to open all 76 multitracks of 2bad and the lag was so bad that i couldn't even arrange it properly so i just exported it like this
general 2023-04-15 03:44:03 kind of want to remake the version of 2bad in the ghosts short film
general 2023-04-15 03:46:37 instrumental version is good at least
general 2023-04-15 03:46:49 so glad there were already premixed stems

general 2023-04-15 04:16:43 which sminker is this
general 2023-04-15 04:17:13 idk i don't get these
general 2023-04-15 04:42:24 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1096649913938493490/dangerous.gif

general 2023-04-15 05:19:29 one winged angel iirc
general 2023-04-15 05:19:47 
general 2023-04-15 05:19:53 i am not touching the ghosts multitracks
general 2023-04-15 05:20:07 76 stereo tracks and it's 8gb
general 2023-04-15 05:20:23 pyt only had 40 mono tracks
general 2023-04-15 05:22:24 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18i6jFOKv_I&pp=ygULNyBkaWdpdHMgbWo%3D
general 2023-04-15 05:22:51 another step closer to having the full dangerous sessions
general 2023-04-15 05:29:20 woo you have expert now
general 2023-04-15 05:52:00 
general 2023-04-15 05:52:10 the metallica logo generator was a mistake
general 2023-04-15 06:22:10 i'm so used to the purple name
general 2023-04-15 10:07:07 the unreleased song serious effect from the dangerous sessions
general 2023-04-15 10:07:09 there's a lot left from the dangerous sessions
general 2023-04-15 10:07:39 not much from history or bad
general 2023-04-15 10:09:35 
general 2023-04-15 10:30:21 i'd rather not talk about it
general 2023-04-15 10:30:50 yeah i don't understand flaunting it around
general 2023-04-15 10:30:58 no
general 2023-04-15 10:31:43 at that point it might just appear to be an attempt to stand out
general 2023-04-15 10:40:06 those i don't support
general 2023-04-15 10:40:31 you shouldn't be pushing someone to discover themselves
general 2023-04-15 10:44:25 i didn't even know this existed
general 2023-04-15 11:14:53 pyt is such an underrated song on thriller imo
general 2023-04-15 11:15:34 of course it's not actually underrated, but it deserves more attention
general 2023-04-15 11:15:46 easily beats billie jean
general 2023-04-15 11:17:13 this is far from a proper mix, but the multitracks exist
general 2023-04-15 11:17:53 i like that most of the thriller multis have some extra stuff before the actual song starts
general 2023-04-15 11:18:08 pyt and human nature are the best songs on thriller
general 2023-04-15 11:18:59 quincy trilogy isn't really my thing though, i like dangerous and beyond more
general 2023-04-15 11:19:08 bad is an exception
general 2023-04-15 11:19:43 teddy riley did a phenomenal job on dangerous
general 2023-04-15 11:20:12 final mix of blood on the dance floor is literally using the demo version as a base (botdf came out in 97)
general 2023-04-15 11:20:21 that's how good it was
general 2023-04-15 11:22:33 
general 2023-04-15 11:22:40 even the rough vocals are used in the final mix
general 2023-04-15 11:27:33 
general 2023-04-15 11:30:31 getting a mod to unde check because you get mildly annoyed at someone
general 2023-04-15 11:30:34 the grind
general 2023-04-15 11:30:57 what is this
general 2023-04-15 11:31:26 oh no
general 2023-04-15 11:32:06 i think this is the best thing i've done with original multitracks
general 2023-04-15 11:32:13 it isn't even good
general 2023-04-15 11:32:41 i think the beatboxing track went unused in the final mix
general 2023-04-15 11:32:53 a mod checking if you're under 13
general 2023-04-15 11:33:10 idk
general 2023-04-15 11:40:48 expert roles
general 2023-04-15 11:41:00 read

general 2023-04-15 13:08:19 everyone sleeping on the history album and invincible
general 2023-04-15 13:08:26 especially invincible
general 2023-04-15 13:08:30 there are some bangers on there
general 2023-04-15 13:23:29 you don't say

general 2023-04-16 01:32:24 i'm gonna give leave me alone another shot
general 2023-04-16 01:33:01 gonna keep saying this, pyt is underrated on thriller
general 2023-04-16 01:54:45 it's a little better
general 2023-04-16 01:55:08 quality is still murdered compared to the original studio tracks
general 2023-04-16 01:55:52 lot of distortion
general 2023-04-16 01:56:23 since these were grabbed from an instagram stream of all things
general 2023-04-16 01:57:07 trying to see if i can get these stream packs in a usable form
general 2023-04-16 03:15:27 he didn't leave
general 2023-04-16 03:15:28 got banned
general 2023-04-16 03:15:54 i think it was nsfw infractions
general 2023-04-16 03:16:51 actually more likely 3 warns
general 2023-04-16 03:17:14 ok yeah it's 3 warns
general 2023-04-16 03:18:51 so you decided to come back

general 2023-04-16 04:20:11 but i can at least upload my one to the mega folder

general 2023-04-16 11:04:54 not in flac though
general 2023-04-16 11:07:24 
general 2023-04-16 11:07:31 print screen or snipping tool
general 2023-04-16 11:07:37 or snip and sketch
general 2023-04-16 11:07:44 or win + shift + s
general 2023-04-16 11:08:04 honestly you're not wrong
general 2023-04-16 11:08:07 i don't like it
general 2023-04-16 11:08:49 ah i didn't know
general 2023-04-16 11:08:57 there should be a screenshot function on mac
general 2023-04-16 11:09:22 
general 2023-04-16 11:09:38 it's really misleading to label this as multitracks but this is better than multitracks
general 2023-04-16 11:10:13 99er
general 2023-04-16 11:19:26 go wild
general 2023-04-16 11:19:31 <@370594904268734464> aquired something rare
general 2023-04-16 11:20:46 the rtt archive and this is all i own from the future records cds
general 2023-04-16 11:21:57 and there's like 30 guitar samples for the intro to trip
general 2023-04-16 11:22:03 i don't have them though
general 2023-04-16 11:22:52 this isn't even all of them
general 2023-04-16 11:23:45 now this is interesting
general 2023-04-16 11:24:07 i didn't even know there's early stuff out there for botdf
general 2023-04-16 11:24:40 7 minutes is long, final album mix is only around 4 minutes
general 2023-04-16 12:04:28 0:20 is what i was looking for
general 2023-04-16 14:36:55 olihere is good
general 2023-04-16 15:27:43 another future records mix
general 2023-04-16 15:30:57 
general 2023-04-16 15:31:28 i mean these are pretty rare to come across
general 2023-04-16 15:31:39 being gatekeeped by collectors and all that
general 2023-04-16 15:54:05 yeah olihere is here
general 2023-04-16 15:54:29 haven't seen you in here for a while
general 2023-04-16 15:55:25 best thing to do honestly
general 2023-04-16 15:58:59 wtf the server isn't level 3 anymore
general 2023-04-16 15:59:01 was gonna post the keep the faith demo
general 2023-04-16 16:00:43 that's better
general 2023-04-16 16:00:45 little bit of some leaked files
general 2023-04-16 16:01:38 idk i'm out of the loop
general 2023-04-16 16:03:15 i have to put more effort in and convert them to flac
general 2023-04-16 16:03:17 too much work
general 2023-04-16 16:04:30 no this is leaked mj files
general 2023-04-16 16:04:36 bunch of early demos and multitracks
general 2023-04-16 16:05:41 i want those known demos of blood on the dance floor
general 2023-04-16 16:06:15 worked on for dangerous, got really far but was shelved, was reworked in 1997
general 2023-04-16 16:06:43 the final mix actually uses the demo as a base
general 2023-04-16 16:08:22 victim of gatekeeping
general 2023-04-16 16:08:47 along with a bunch of other early dangerous material on those cds
general 2023-04-16 16:10:51 there's this but i'm pretty sure this is just the rough vocals and the backing track from the multitracks
general 2023-04-17 05:48:40 it's wild that the teaser for the history album is so good
general 2023-04-17 05:48:57 someone scanned a film reel of it but it hasn't been fully released
general 2023-04-17 05:48:59 full 4k
general 2023-04-17 05:50:34 do have to say it needs a lot of work
general 2023-04-17 05:50:43 colour balancing is off
general 2023-04-17 06:18:38 the curse of many f2p games
general 2023-04-17 06:19:38 this is why i don't touch any of those, much rather have the full thing and a good game at that
general 2023-04-17 08:59:22 why did you think you could say it
general 2023-04-17 09:29:14 wtf is this
general 2023-04-17 09:31:28 this is such a banger story
general 2023-04-17 09:31:32 i mean real history
general 2023-04-17 10:30:44 the scrapped 2nd disc of the special edition release of dangerous
general 2023-04-17 10:33:14 rare stuff
general 2023-04-17 10:37:25 tbh i see why none of the bryan loren stuff was included on dangerous
general 2023-04-17 10:37:38 it's so different from the teddy riley stuff
general 2023-04-17 10:50:43 he has not been mod for a while
general 2023-04-17 10:51:20 proof
general 2023-04-17 10:51:42 i'm mirroring all of this stuff
general 2023-04-17 10:56:50 have to witness the downfall
general 2023-04-17 11:00:45 the early dangerous stuff sounds more like an alternate reality where the bad album never happened and dangerous was made instead of it
general 2023-04-17 11:30:21 things are happening
general 2023-04-17 11:37:00 
general 2023-04-17 15:03:32 because helltaker fandom
general 2023-04-17 15:04:37 ex-zodiac x smooth criminal
general 2023-04-17 15:04:40 damn
general 2023-04-17 15:04:56 how would that shit work
general 2023-04-17 15:05:17 no
general 2023-04-17 15:06:17 it would've been ex-zodiac x bad if it was the 2nd last roblox game played
general 2023-04-17 15:12:01 what
general 2023-04-17 15:46:43 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1096658834187100160/bad.gif
general 2023-04-17 16:52:27 nice

general 2023-04-18 09:45:37 uncensored instrumental of scream with bg vocals
general 2023-04-18 09:45:54 the full uncensored one
general 2023-04-18 09:46:22 no more "stop pressuring me", just "stop fuckin with me"
general 2023-04-18 09:46:26 from the original multitracks
general 2023-04-18 09:49:04 i think so
general 2023-04-18 09:51:45 2nd time the chorus rolls around both janet and mj aren't even bothered to censor it
general 2023-04-18 09:53:49 
general 2023-04-18 09:53:53 i only have legit stuff
general 2023-04-18 10:01:04 an inability to move on
general 2023-04-18 10:03:02 he's gone from here and moved on
general 2023-04-18 10:03:06 let it go
general 2023-04-18 10:03:46 i seriously can't remember anything about him other than him having extremely high standards
general 2023-04-18 10:03:56 and being very vocal about it
general 2023-04-18 10:04:12 not really much different from other people
general 2023-04-18 10:04:34 i've gone blank
general 2023-04-18 10:16:12 
general 2023-04-18 10:20:48 about unfriending everyone from pcc
general 2023-04-18 10:21:21 yeah idk why he kept me added
general 2023-04-18 10:21:24 must've forgot
general 2023-04-18 10:21:33 or was just lazy

general 2023-04-18 10:22:50 the spiritual successor to abc
general 2023-04-18 10:23:22 from an acetate version of the 2nd scrapped cd of the 2001 special edition of dangerous
general 2023-04-18 10:23:44 the legitimacy
general 2023-04-18 10:23:55 inventor is good friend
general 2023-04-18 10:25:54 fuck clubremixer!
general 2023-04-18 10:25:59 hate gatekeeping
general 2023-04-18 10:26:38 stranger in moscow is currently still being guarded by them
general 2023-04-18 10:29:53 (i'm not a korg nex)
general 2023-04-18 10:30:44 korg nex did pay thousands of dollars for his collection though
general 2023-04-18 11:00:04 supplying rare stuff again
general 2023-04-18 11:01:08 going with teddy riley and all that was the right decision for dangerous tbh
general 2023-04-18 11:01:25 yeah of course
general 2023-04-18 11:01:52 it'll look suspicious if i just send a mega folder here lmao
general 2023-04-18 11:04:33 mega and slsk are the 2 places i use all the time
general 2023-04-18 11:05:18 1st one is the scrapped 2nd cd for the 2001 special edition release of dangerous
general 2023-04-18 11:05:27 was found as an acetate
general 2023-04-18 11:06:20 scream stems are literally just the stems for the song scream
general 2023-04-18 11:06:33 i don't even know what it really means
general 2023-04-18 11:06:58 oh it's basically a test pressing
general 2023-04-18 11:07:33 just a cdr
general 2023-04-18 11:08:03 recordable cd
general 2023-04-18 11:08:44 this copy is literally the final mastered cd
general 2023-04-18 11:08:58 idk how it got out from epic records but it did
general 2023-04-18 11:10:32 there is still a lot missing from the dangerous sessions, including 7 digits and don't believe it
general 2023-04-18 11:11:01 basically the rest of the stuff done by bryan loren
general 2023-04-18 11:11:30 nah it's fine, i just like putting stuff out there
general 2023-04-18 11:11:59 yeah they're all the unreleased songs from dangerous
general 2023-04-18 11:12:31 true
general 2023-04-18 11:13:21 but i'm just so used to referring to them as the dangerous sessions like all the others in the mj community
general 2023-04-18 11:13:30 my mistake
general 2023-04-18 11:17:41 yeah kinda got thrown off since i thought i was in the mj server lmao
general 2023-04-18 11:18:24 michael jackson
the-dump 2023-04-18 11:23:29 cute cat
the-dump 2023-04-18 11:24:17 yeah it's really good
general 2023-04-18 13:22:29 the heal the world stems are in the leak and i've never noticed
general 2023-04-18 13:25:11 the song mj was the most proud of
general 2023-04-18 13:25:20 not smooth criminal or any of the others
general 2023-04-18 13:25:23 heal the world
general 2023-04-18 13:27:14 all of it is here
general 2023-04-18 13:28:09 wtf the full mix of bad is here too
general 2023-04-18 14:05:18 people in the mj server don't really like heal the world or earth song
general 2023-04-18 14:05:25 hi septagin
general 2023-04-18 14:06:36 i like both of them though, they're nice
general 2023-04-18 14:06:48 even will you be there
general 2023-04-18 14:20:34 no it wasn't, 2002 was 3 years ago
general 2023-04-18 14:21:10 in the 2005 continuity
general 2023-04-18 14:21:18 ah fair
general 2023-04-18 14:28:30 i might be getting both of my copies of history tomorrow
general 2023-04-18 14:50:43 he's gone rogue
general 2023-04-18 14:51:44 i just noticed that
general 2023-04-18 15:02:26 why
general 2023-04-18 15:03:45 but why nsfw
general 2023-04-18 15:03:49 what's the point
general 2023-04-18 15:05:16 mj server goes crazy
general 2023-04-18 15:05:55 every single and album cover is a sticker there
general 2023-04-18 15:12:27 electrician union
general 2023-04-18 15:13:21 smooth criminal all the way
general 2023-04-18 15:13:52 stranger in moscow is one of his best songs imo
general 2023-04-18 15:14:25 even better if it's the original moonwalker version, bit iffy on the album version
general 2023-04-18 15:14:43 fuck yeah it does
general 2023-04-18 15:15:05 it's how it's meant to be listened to
general 2023-04-18 15:15:11 how it was composed originally
general 2023-04-18 15:15:51 original speed too, since the song was sped up for both the music video and album
general 2023-04-18 15:18:12 i feel like leave me alone is one of the most underrated songs on bad
general 2023-04-18 15:18:15 it's so good
general 2023-04-18 15:19:12 also it's when he started directly addressing the media with his music
general 2023-04-18 15:20:35 the clear version of jam
general 2023-04-18 15:20:44 no voice sample in the background
general 2023-04-18 15:28:05 i come back to the mj server and scroll up to see if i missed anything and i just see this
general 2023-04-18 15:28:12 what is even going on
general 2023-04-18 16:33:35 the grind
general 2023-04-19 03:40:24 there is a 6 minute version of you are not alone in stems
general 2023-04-19 07:58:10 you literally just sent this
general 2023-04-19 08:06:29 he isn't wrong
general 2023-04-19 08:07:52 for you and for me, and the entire human race
general 2023-04-19 08:08:29 nope lol
general 2023-04-19 08:08:33 it's always been this
general 2023-04-19 08:08:37 never reverified
general 2023-04-19 08:15:28 mind blank
general 2023-04-19 08:15:30 i should know this
general 2023-04-19 08:22:11 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/675609335371530247/1095742980222095490/botdf.gif
general 2023-04-19 08:25:34 it's just assumed
general 2023-04-19 11:47:10 
general 2023-04-19 11:49:09 got the track from the leaked multis
general 2023-04-19 11:51:04 oh and some stuff from the laptop leak that i somehow overlooked
general 2023-04-19 11:51:15 stems for heal the world are there but no difference
general 2023-04-19 11:52:37 i'm so glad i don't have to listen to 6 minutes of this on the album
general 2023-04-19 13:02:39 babs is
general 2023-04-19 13:02:41 shopping
general 2023-04-19 13:03:11 
general 2023-04-19 13:04:07 at least a couple years
general 2023-04-19 13:05:45 the khopesh
general 2023-04-19 13:06:24 i forgot the name for the corruptors
general 2023-04-19 13:40:20 bad's hits at the start are actually like this
general 2023-04-19 13:40:37 the horns make all the difference
general 2023-04-19 13:42:25 you're literally just doing it wrong
general 2023-04-19 14:05:03 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/675609335371530247/1095742980222095490/botdf.gif
general 2023-04-19 14:05:31 botdf is such a banger
general 2023-04-19 14:17:11 i think it's partly an aesthetic choice and also less taxing on hardware
general 2023-04-19 14:18:22 ex-zodiac is the best looking recent low poly game
general 2023-04-19 14:20:46 the grind
general 2023-04-19 14:29:18 i'm surprised you're still here
general 2023-04-20 05:54:33 can't believe there's no dangerous 30 or history 25
general 2023-04-20 05:54:39 and yet they do thriller 40
general 2023-04-20 08:13:16 is it possible to bypass copyrighted music in roblox by uploading original stems and playing them all at once
general 2023-04-20 08:14:38 hi
general 2023-04-20 08:15:04 no i remember i could play my own audio in plane crazy after the audio change
general 2023-04-20 08:15:43 that’s shit
general 2023-04-20 08:16:04 why does the speaker gamepass still exist then
general 2023-04-20 08:16:21 oh kinda forgot sfx exist
general 2023-04-20 08:16:34 but then it should be free
general 2023-04-20 08:17:06 since functionality has been really hindered
general 2023-04-20 08:22:25 gonna have to experiment with this sometime
general 2023-04-20 10:07:04 i don't think it would've been a good idea to escalate it
general 2023-04-20 10:08:19 good
general 2023-04-20 10:16:38 iirc he posted an update somewhere not long ago
general 2023-04-20 10:17:15 because someone sent the exact same thing a while ago and replied with it lmao
general 2023-04-20 10:17:33 i forgot if it was on here or twitter
general 2023-04-20 10:23:11 recreating the blood on the dance floor bassline with the sample
general 2023-04-20 10:29:18 it's looped as well
general 2023-04-20 10:40:30 that teddy riley synth bass
general 2023-04-20 10:40:54 botdf screams "dangerous" because it was made for dangerous
general 2023-04-20 10:44:17 not again
general 2023-04-20 10:55:49 classic
general 2023-04-20 10:56:40 the heal the world pop lock goes so hard
general 2023-04-20 10:57:20 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/675609335371530247/1098562430247915530/204c8c365ec8bff93c9e38473ad567322.mov
general 2023-04-20 10:57:42 the fact that this really happened is what gets me
general 2023-04-20 10:57:49 on heal the world of all things
general 2023-04-20 11:33:08 the facts
general 2023-04-20 11:33:16 undeniable
general 2023-04-20 11:33:38 haven't even played ultrakill but it looks really good
general 2023-04-20 12:30:28 they build stuff out of francium
general 2023-04-20 12:30:53 they used all their good materials on the statue of liberty
general 2023-04-20 12:31:02 so they have to use francium now
general 2023-04-20 12:53:25 """switzerland"""
general 2023-04-20 13:10:35 almost over
general 2023-04-20 13:10:47 don't mind the 2023 my date is fucked up
general 2023-04-20 13:10:51 should be 2005
general 2023-04-20 13:38:37 thriller album is overrated
general 2023-04-20 13:39:13 the flow isn't really great
general 2023-04-20 13:39:24 also i find myself skipping songs on thriller
general 2023-04-21 02:27:12 the ultimate wasting money
general 2023-04-21 05:58:11 <@370594904268734464> it arrived
general 2023-04-21 05:58:41 original 1995 release
general 2023-04-21 06:02:47 holy shit
general 2023-04-21 06:02:49 holy fucking shit
general 2023-04-21 06:03:00 original uncensored release
general 2023-04-21 06:09:18 this could’ve easily been sold for like 100 bucks
general 2023-04-21 06:43:36 yeah the song “they don’t care about us” was censored in later releases
general 2023-04-21 06:44:09 and the actual song “HIStory” had a clip from another song as the intro, and had to be changed in later releases
general 2023-04-21 06:44:49 the actual rigidity of the case between this original one and the repress is night and day
general 2023-04-21 06:50:52 hi yousuf
general 2023-04-21 06:51:39 i bought thriller 25 today as well
general 2023-04-21 06:51:53 ngl better presentation than thriller 40
general 2023-04-21 06:52:53 yeah i’m just getting the main albums
general 2023-04-21 06:53:41 still can’t believe that i managed to get the uncensored release of history
general 2023-04-21 06:56:15 getting invincible is going to be so great
general 2023-04-21 06:56:22 4 alternate covers
general 2023-04-21 13:19:10 
general 2023-04-21 13:39:57 that makes no sense
general 2023-04-21 13:40:05 
general 2023-04-21 15:45:02 wikipedia moderation is very strict
general 2023-04-21 15:45:29 how can you even get racist out of that
general 2023-04-21 15:46:03 true
general 2023-04-22 02:05:24 you don’t need to ask someone to share something
general 2023-04-22 09:11:15 still needs a bit of work to get it all there with no talk over it
general 2023-04-22 10:54:03 can't be bothered removing the voiceover from brad
general 2023-04-22 10:54:05 too hard
general 2023-04-22 13:38:22 """like new"""
general 2023-04-22 13:38:43 i don't think there was a big crack in the jewel case when it was new
general 2023-04-22 13:39:24 also amazing picture quality
general 2023-04-22 13:44:23 debating whether i get an original 2001 pressing of invincible or a repress
general 2023-04-22 13:45:49 nah
general 2023-04-22 13:46:38 fuckin hell
general 2023-04-22 13:47:23 can make bank if i get all the covers and sell them
general 2023-04-22 13:47:32 but i won't
general 2023-04-22 13:54:21 no way the invincible album promo photoshoot
general 2023-04-22 13:54:46 some of those promo photos make a lot of sense
general 2023-04-22 13:55:07 tf is this
the-dump 2023-04-22 13:55:31 good idea
general 2023-04-22 14:04:09 nah this is some other guy
general 2023-04-22 14:04:16 pretending to be yousuf
general 2023-04-22 14:13:42 how many revs
general 2023-04-22 14:13:53 damn
general 2023-04-22 14:14:07 should be at least 3
general 2023-04-22 14:26:43 gotta figure out the best volume levels for the black or white stems
general 2023-04-22 14:26:49 things are going on
general 2023-04-22 14:43:15 laptop will do the job
general 2023-04-22 14:44:26 extreme performance 💪

general 2023-04-22 14:47:16 not gonna touch this anymore
general 2023-04-22 14:48:35 best part of the song
general 2023-04-22 14:48:49 who is it is way better than black or white
general 2023-04-22 14:51:14 fuckin hell i muted the vocals
general 2023-04-22 14:51:22 this is what i get for doing stuff at 1am
general 2023-04-22 14:51:37 
general 2023-04-22 14:55:08 gonna try a little experiment with demucs
general 2023-04-22 14:57:20 try to separate the bass track from the final mix of botdf and compare that one with the original studio multitracks
general 2023-04-22 16:08:29 👀
general 2023-04-22 16:08:33 gonna reach 1b
general 2023-04-22 16:10:38 all i wanna say is that they don't really care about us
general 2023-04-23 11:36:08 it's done
general 2023-04-23 12:47:23 something i dug up from my capture folder
general 2023-04-24 03:02:18 nah this is really safe
general 2023-04-24 03:05:41 the propane tanks make it very good
general 2023-04-24 03:05:45 high stakes
general 2023-04-24 03:10:23 evil
general 2023-04-24 03:10:27 anything but french
general 2023-04-24 03:18:15 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1079566549951709364/1095873750207057920/AutoMemes.gif
general 2023-04-24 03:29:12 it's fake btw
general 2023-04-24 03:29:21 this image has been around for a while now
general 2023-04-24 08:12:05 i might try to reassemble the album version of you rock my world from the remix stems
general 2023-04-24 10:06:57 twitter verification:
general 2023-04-24 10:07:27 lmao
general 2023-04-24 15:19:18 roblox is a shitty platform too
general 2023-04-24 15:19:54 funny
general 2023-04-25 09:44:57 that probably is the reason lmao
general 2023-04-25 11:02:25 this shit better go faster
general 2023-04-25 11:02:58 it's going in my archives
general 2023-04-25 11:03:36 no it's the service
general 2023-04-25 11:03:45 slow as shit
general 2023-04-25 11:04:19 i downloaded a whole gb on mega and it only took like a couple minutes
general 2023-04-25 11:05:21 what a transfer speed
general 2023-04-25 11:05:33 love this service
general 2023-04-25 11:05:42 at least stuff doesn't really get taken down
general 2023-04-25 11:05:47 and there's no gb limit
general 2023-04-25 11:06:50 i would use mega but only the mp3 multitracks are in my usual source
general 2023-04-25 11:07:16 yeah there's this huge archive on there
general 2023-04-25 11:07:38 mega sucks, gdrive is better
general 2023-04-25 11:09:51 my small archive on my external drive
general 2023-04-25 11:10:32 privacy vocals?
general 2023-04-25 11:10:40 the vocals from the song privacy
general 2023-04-25 11:10:53 because for some reason those leaked and not the rest of the song
general 2023-04-25 11:11:06 (only material from the invincible album that has been leaked)
general 2023-04-25 11:11:38 idk about the you rock my world one i think it's a recreation
general 2023-04-25 11:12:07 what
general 2023-04-25 11:12:25 nah
general 2023-04-25 11:24:48 reached new lows
general 2023-04-25 11:24:59 i don't know if this is worse than anonfiles
general 2023-04-25 11:29:22 the vocals for privacy
general 2023-04-25 11:29:27 it's the full original version
general 2023-04-25 11:29:31 was cut down for the album
general 2023-04-25 11:30:05 idk
general 2023-04-25 11:30:25 no
general 2023-04-25 11:32:59 idk there's a bit of layers
general 2023-04-25 11:37:00 impossible
general 2023-04-25 11:37:18 we in the 3 digit speeds now
general 2023-04-25 11:39:35 have you got burning shores
general 2023-04-25 11:39:45 i can't get it cause ps4
general 2023-04-25 11:39:57 don't spoil pls
general 2023-04-25 11:40:25 ngl i'm actually more hyped for tears of the kingdom
general 2023-04-25 11:42:03 that looks sick as
general 2023-04-25 11:42:22 how is aloy using zenith tech
general 2023-04-25 11:43:31 same size as the deactivated ones yeah?
general 2023-04-25 11:43:39 i mean idk why it wouldn't be smaller
general 2023-04-25 11:43:55 oh yeah i've seen that
general 2023-04-25 11:44:00 it's bigger
general 2023-04-25 11:44:01 oh shit
general 2023-04-25 11:44:23 i see why the dlc is ps5 exclusive
general 2023-04-25 11:44:53 i'm not gonna pay a lot of money just to play the dlc
general 2023-04-25 11:45:18 the ps5 is expensive as shit
general 2023-04-25 11:46:03 do you know if my ps4 copy will work with the dlc on the ps5
general 2023-04-25 11:47:01 like i know you can play with the ps4 copy on there
general 2023-04-25 11:47:10 but idk if the dlc will be compatible
general 2023-04-25 11:47:12 it should be
general 2023-04-25 11:48:46 turns out it's incompatible
general 2023-04-25 11:55:19 almost like $800 aud just so i can play the dlc
general 2023-04-25 11:55:21 yeah no
general 2023-04-25 12:03:30 i want a portable cd player with a big window on the top
general 2023-04-25 12:03:59 so many cool cd designs and yet you can't see them while it's playing
general 2023-04-25 13:06:57 i played fw on my ps4 and i felt that it actually ran good
general 2023-04-25 13:07:12 it was developed for ps4 after all
general 2023-04-25 13:07:58 ok so only like around $700 aud for me to play the dlc
general 2023-04-25 13:08:23 real life
general 2023-04-25 13:09:05 but in all seriousness stormworks is probably your best bet
general 2023-04-25 13:15:46 the peshay studio set isn't exactly chill but i find it improves concentration for me
general 2023-04-25 13:16:00 basically atmospheric dnb in general
general 2023-04-25 13:17:28 the weekend world album from the e-z rollers, the mix on the moving shadow compilation album "blueprint", self evident truth of an intuitive mind, etc.
general 2023-04-25 13:18:27 the atmosphere chapters (mixes)
general 2023-04-25 13:19:24 trans-central connection (moving shadow album), goldie's "timeless"
general 2023-04-25 13:43:48 wow
general 2023-04-25 13:44:34 with the multitracks i just look at them and sometimes do stuff with them
general 2023-04-25 13:44:50 fun to see how they were made
general 2023-04-25 13:46:16 rare shit
general 2023-04-25 13:47:07 only the contents of a handful of these studio cds are known to be backed up
general 2023-04-25 13:47:28 i'm really interested in what would be on the blood on the dance floor cd
general 2023-04-25 13:50:14 i do not know why there's 2 tracks there that aren't the same or similar length to the final mix
general 2023-04-25 13:50:25 oh and someone put your hand out apparently has a cd too
general 2023-04-25 13:51:09 real shame both of these never made it to dangerous
general 2023-04-25 13:51:46 botdf did get released in 97 but it's not the original dangerous version
general 2023-04-25 13:51:53 had some additions and tweaks
general 2023-04-25 13:52:17 someone put your hand out did get released in its original form
general 2023-04-25 14:01:11 i've ordered the pop up dangerous album with the gold cd
general 2023-04-26 11:37:15 the gold history cds are so class
general 2023-04-26 11:37:22 silver ones look bad compared to them
general 2023-04-26 11:37:43 it really is
general 2023-04-26 11:38:22 all of his albums on epic are amazing
general 2023-04-26 11:38:32 except maybe invincible
general 2023-04-26 11:39:40 invincible still has good shit though
general 2023-04-26 11:41:30 
general 2023-04-26 11:42:13 i don’t play this copy i’ve got a silver discs one that i play
general 2023-04-26 11:42:45 disc 2 has been played once to verify that it’s an uncensored copy
general 2023-04-26 11:42:53 never played disc 1
general 2023-04-26 11:59:56 lmao
general 2023-04-26 14:09:24 is anyone from the original team17 still at the company?
general 2023-04-26 14:09:39 i doubt it
general 2023-04-26 14:12:54 what do you think?
general 2023-04-26 14:15:41 why would a plane crazy server allow fp builds
general 2023-04-26 14:16:04 not meant to be there
general 2023-04-26 14:16:10 idk roblox is shit
general 2023-04-26 14:20:30 the namco timeline shit is even more confusing
general 2023-04-26 14:21:02 ace combat 3 is related to galaxian and dig dug
general 2023-04-26 14:21:05 it's legit
general 2023-04-26 14:56:59 ai filtering really has improved
general 2023-04-26 14:57:53 i think the bass might be acoustic
general 2023-04-26 14:58:08 i always thought it was sampled
general 2023-04-26 15:01:19 i've got all the original samples used in the song, meant to be used with an akai s3200 sampler
general 2023-04-26 15:14:35 oli is cool french
general 2023-04-26 15:14:59 the only one
general 2023-04-26 15:15:26 i do
general 2023-04-26 15:15:41 the french are not good
general 2023-04-26 15:15:52 wasted all their good materials on the statue of liberty
general 2023-04-26 15:16:00 so now they only use francium
general 2023-04-26 15:16:29 oli isn't full on french so it's an exception
general 2023-04-26 15:16:54 yes i think
general 2023-04-26 15:17:08 i don't know
general 2023-04-26 15:17:41 gotta keep spreading this around since nobody is downloading it from soulseek
general 2023-04-26 15:18:59 a full version of privacy might exist someday, the vocals go on longer than the actual released song
general 2023-04-26 15:19:25 
general 2023-04-26 15:19:57 i have to say i wish the clean bg vocals for 2000 watts get leaked someday
general 2023-04-26 15:21:33 i can just upload the entire dangerous album in flac and nobody will question it
general 2023-04-26 15:22:17 infact i'll start
general 2023-04-26 15:22:33 i think bruce swedien (rip) had some involvement in jam's production
general 2023-04-26 15:23:15 best french statistics
general 2023-04-26 15:23:48 trip is very overlooked for some reason
general 2023-04-26 15:24:11 i don't think i can send track 3 because it might violate the rules lmao
general 2023-04-26 15:24:45 i'm all about this
general 2023-04-26 15:24:58 i don't like to keep things bottled up
general 2023-04-26 15:25:11 i prefer to just put it out there or try it
general 2023-04-26 15:25:52 whoops there goes like half the album
general 2023-04-26 15:28:02 what song is this from
general 2023-04-26 15:29:18 ah okay
general 2023-04-26 15:32:02 we know our next target
general 2023-04-26 15:32:28 just to see the cool explosion
general 2023-04-26 15:32:30 nothing more
general 2023-04-26 15:35:16 don't visit manchester
general 2023-04-26 15:35:23 it's fully irradiated
general 2023-04-26 15:35:35 you will not come out alive
general 2023-04-26 15:38:31 the last thing i'd do is play a gacha game
general 2023-04-26 15:38:32 fuck those
general 2023-04-26 15:39:38 it's a real shame that the last mega man x game is a gacha game
general 2023-04-26 15:39:55 the first 3 mmx games easily beat classic mega man
general 2023-04-26 15:43:10 it's better to get local files
general 2023-04-26 15:43:29 although it does take up a lot of storage, it's really worth it
general 2023-04-26 15:43:32 no ads ever
general 2023-04-26 15:43:38 no internet needed
general 2023-04-26 15:45:19 virtual insanity is good but i assume you probably know about it or the music video, popular after all
general 2023-04-26 16:07:19 you're still here?
general 2023-04-26 16:11:06 i would send someone put your hand out or mj's duet with one of the bee gees but yeah
general 2023-04-27 11:30:15 since when wtf
general 2023-04-27 11:51:59 not a her
general 2023-04-27 11:52:12 i didn't mind witw
general 2023-04-27 11:52:26 nah a guy
general 2023-04-27 11:52:48 of course
general 2023-04-27 12:01:36 damn i wish the original multis for speed demon got leaked
general 2023-04-27 12:01:41 instead of this stream pack
general 2023-04-27 12:01:53 this would've been all separated
general 2023-04-27 12:02:25 i don't
general 2023-04-27 12:02:41 because i wouldn't have all of them still there
general 2023-04-27 12:03:26 stuff
general 2023-04-27 12:03:31 don't worry about it
general 2023-04-27 12:13:40 witw is literally just some random guy who was here once
general 2023-04-27 12:13:44 that is it
general 2023-04-27 12:16:11 casual misinfo
general 2023-04-27 12:16:22 that's just some random picture lmao
general 2023-04-27 12:16:53 no i mean that's real witw
general 2023-04-27 12:19:01 "her"
general 2023-04-27 12:21:37 speed demon without the car sounds
general 2023-04-27 12:21:45 it sounds so wrong holy shit
general 2023-04-27 12:23:02 i didn't hear about the dms part
general 2023-04-27 12:23:18 apart from them sending thigh pics to some people or some shit
general 2023-04-27 12:23:42 i don't even know everything
general 2023-04-27 12:24:41 i didn't really mind chips
general 2023-04-29 04:34:58 exzodiac update out, new bangers
general 2023-04-30 08:42:40 so that new exzodiac update just came out and i've already got s ranks on the new stages
general 2023-04-30 08:43:21 stage 8 is a banger
general 2023-04-30 12:32:24 super mario odyssey song stems leaked somehow
general 2023-04-30 12:47:36 the hottest of hot takes
general 2023-04-30 14:46:36 wow ssen i didn't know you were back
general 2023-04-30 14:47:35 tbh happy
general 2023-04-30 14:47:53 maybe
general 2023-04-30 17:10:04 john weezer himself
general 2023-05-01 16:00:57 new zelda actually leaked somehow lmao
general 2023-05-01 16:01:10 first the artbook now the actual game
general 2023-05-02 12:54:33 i have played the first 5 or so minutes of totk before deciding it's not worth it and i should wait for the game to actually come out
general 2023-05-02 12:54:47 (emulation is very rough)
general 2023-05-02 13:18:36 another stream pack (actually decent though)
general 2023-05-02 13:30:48 
general 2023-05-02 23:53:53 got beef with google maps
general 2023-05-02 23:54:01 they won't accept my actual places
general 2023-05-03 09:29:29 he's got the vip blacklist role lmao
general 2023-05-04 10:54:22 i should've done this earlier smh
general 2023-05-04 11:14:31 history definitive going crazy
general 2023-05-04 11:14:58 i only know of the original mix of scream
general 2023-05-04 11:15:01 and i think that's it
general 2023-05-04 11:15:17 sources
general 2023-05-04 11:15:30 (these versions come from a leak that happened early this year)
general 2023-05-04 11:15:59 i've got the original mix in mp3 but not good enough
general 2023-05-04 11:16:47 the one on the album is edited
general 2023-05-04 11:21:39 i regret not saving my audacity projects
general 2023-05-04 11:23:03 i had scream but with the original uncensored bgv all lined up but i've only got an mp3 copy saved lol
general 2023-05-04 11:23:14 
general 2023-05-04 11:23:20 not even with vocals because smart
general 2023-05-04 11:30:45 can't believe there's no dangerous 30 or history 25
general 2023-05-04 11:31:10 dangerous 30 would've been easy as since there's literally a disc 2 just sitting there in the archives
general 2023-05-04 11:31:32 from the 2001 release
general 2023-05-04 12:10:06 does roblox have a 64bit version now
general 2023-05-04 12:10:09 impossible
general 2023-05-04 12:10:40 i thought it was always 32 bit
general 2023-05-04 12:10:55 no way
general 2023-05-04 12:11:16 never thought i'd see the day
general 2023-05-04 12:11:25 but of course they fuck it up lmao
general 2023-05-04 13:44:26 scream is finally sort of done (took way too long)
general 2023-05-04 14:06:29 at least 30
general 2023-05-05 09:49:28 no sorry
general 2023-05-05 12:51:17 base wars was the shit back in 2014 and 2015
general 2023-05-05 12:51:42 was never good at it but i enjoyed it
general 2023-05-05 14:38:16 spreading this around cause i think this might be rare in flac
general 2023-05-05 14:38:33 i don't know anything about it but i downloaded it
general 2023-05-05 14:38:51 other than the fact it's a demo for apom
general 2023-05-06 04:49:15 fuck
general 2023-05-06 04:49:21 the entire multitrack archive is down
general 2023-05-06 04:49:29 all gone
general 2023-05-06 04:50:30 there was this mega folder up with a bunch of leaked stems for mj songs but it's been taken down
general 2023-05-06 05:16:22 i might be able to save a lot of them
general 2023-05-06 05:16:32 over 100 known to be in circulation
general 2023-05-06 08:01:52 no way dangerous multitracks exist
general 2023-05-06 08:28:16 i've got everything
general 2023-05-06 08:28:26 now i need to put it all back up
general 2023-05-06 08:31:51 somehow
general 2023-05-06 08:48:29 what have you tried with the boomboxes
general 2023-05-06 08:48:53 iirc the only audio still up are the official roblox tracks and raining tacos
general 2023-05-06 08:49:26 yeah nobody can hear it
general 2023-05-06 08:49:39 client sided
general 2023-05-06 09:08:06 https://tenor.com/view/michael-jackson-michael-jackson-smirk-gif-21914264
general 2023-05-06 09:08:13 such a good gif
general 2023-05-06 09:08:28 everyone in the mj server loves it lmao
general 2023-05-06 11:20:16 he's got that mj glove
general 2023-05-06 11:29:26 they put the crown on
general 2023-05-06 11:29:28 good enough for me
general 2023-05-06 11:32:32 how much misinfo are you reading each day
general 2023-05-06 13:50:18 he's just like that
general 2023-05-06 13:54:42 "escape the matrix" lmao
general 2023-05-06 14:06:27 best part about war thunder is the stuff that gets leaked because of it
general 2023-05-06 14:09:28 i need to download everything i've been given tomorrow
general 2023-05-06 14:09:37 can't afford to lose anything
general 2023-05-06 14:09:49 next step would be mirroring
general 2023-05-06 14:10:24 they took down the multitrack archive but i ended up getting more than what the archive had
general 2023-05-07 08:54:15 he's the guy
general 2023-05-07 08:54:51 glad i don't know anything about this
general 2023-05-07 08:56:15 yeah i don't think i'll be looking at his video about it
general 2023-05-07 08:58:17 i don't even remember the last mutahar video i watched
general 2023-05-07 09:01:17 kinda hard to find the original version of images in high quality
general 2023-05-07 09:01:36 also has official cover art scan from the moving shadow website
general 2023-05-07 11:48:34 it's time
general 2023-05-07 11:48:46 mirroring all of this
general 2023-05-07 12:54:44 i am not looking forward to downloading 3 versions of thriller's multitracks at all
general 2023-05-07 12:55:11 so fun
general 2023-05-07 12:55:11 and the 20 million track ones from off the wall
general 2023-05-07 13:24:27 a little bit of the archives
general 2023-05-07 13:24:31 (munich 1997 live)
general 2023-05-07 13:25:19 i'm listening to the botdf performance tracks and the keyboard patch for the organ is surprisingly close to the real thing
general 2023-05-07 13:44:09 i'm surprised this shit even exists
general 2023-05-07 13:44:18 song starts at 2:27
general 2023-05-07 13:44:37 entire live performance
general 2023-05-07 13:45:12 it's so good
general 2023-05-07 13:47:47 need to reopen the live mic feed from the botdf performance
general 2023-05-07 13:47:49 was so good
general 2023-05-07 13:53:35 
general 2023-05-07 13:54:09 makes sense why it's like this knowing that he was dancing as well
general 2023-05-07 13:54:35 around 45 minutes into the halfshow
general 2023-05-07 13:55:15 the dangerous live mic is actually really good
general 2023-05-07 13:59:58 graphics don't really matter all too much
general 2023-05-07 15:37:40 to me the mario movie looks to be a nightmare in terms of pacing
general 2023-05-08 01:59:29 that literally makes no sense
general 2023-05-08 06:48:15 wtf there are 2 official mixes of scream in the laptop leak labelled as heal the world
general 2023-05-08 06:48:29 (it wasn't even done right)
general 2023-05-08 06:53:53 the official stems combine the "stop pressuring me" and "stop fucking with me" tracks into 1?? shows how much effort was put into it
general 2023-05-08 07:07:45 like this is better than anything i can put out but that one issue makes it shit
general 2023-05-08 07:36:27 not touching this for a long time
general 2023-05-08 07:36:43 hate the scream stems
general 2023-05-08 07:36:44 i give up
general 2023-05-08 07:37:06 mhm
general 2023-05-08 07:37:41 is it because of the uh
general 2023-05-08 07:37:54 stuff associated with him
general 2023-05-08 07:38:13 i see
general 2023-05-08 07:38:28 i used to believe them but not anymore
general 2023-05-08 07:39:03 1993 and 2005 allegations
general 2023-05-08 07:39:13 yeah
general 2023-05-08 07:39:28 i highly doubt them though
general 2023-05-08 07:39:46 there's been multiple documentaries that show both sides of the story
general 2023-05-08 07:40:56 one of the accusers tried to apply for a job at the michael jackson estate before he went through with it
general 2023-05-08 07:41:54 he got denied though
general 2023-05-08 07:44:55 whatever the truth is you can't deny he made good music
general 2023-05-08 07:51:28 we can never know if he's guilty or not, it's all up to how you interpret the factual information out there
general 2023-05-08 07:51:54 however i can say the baby dangling incident is inexcusable, that was fucked
general 2023-05-08 07:55:55 was at a hotel and fans were outside waiting for him to show blanket and he accidentally held him over the balcony for a couple seconds
general 2023-05-08 07:56:02 nah
general 2023-05-08 07:56:13 well not in this context
general 2023-05-08 07:56:23 we don't know and will never know
general 2023-05-08 07:58:29 can only form an opinion after looking at the facts
general 2023-05-08 07:59:25 what
general 2023-05-08 07:59:30 fuck no
general 2023-05-08 08:00:10 made good shit
general 2023-05-08 08:00:25 yeah
general 2023-05-08 08:00:43 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1084966026871058473/1096611338626797588/SPINFAST.gif
general 2023-05-08 08:01:06 had vitiligo
general 2023-05-08 08:01:30 needed to bleach his skin after "bad" era otherwise it would look really bad
general 2023-05-08 08:01:52 really blotchy
general 2023-05-08 08:02:42 vitiligo and lupus
general 2023-05-08 08:03:10 can't believe some people still think it's fake even though it's clearly stated in the autopsy
general 2023-05-08 08:04:02 yeah the pepsi one
general 2023-05-08 08:04:13 that really affected him
general 2023-05-08 08:04:23 started his painkiller addiction
general 2023-05-08 08:05:49 didn't heal properly too because of his skin conditions
general 2023-05-08 08:06:14 mhm
general 2023-05-08 08:06:50 even made a song about morphine
general 2023-05-08 08:07:39 all the medication was the death of him
general 2023-05-08 08:08:11 but they shouldn't have started on the this is it tour
general 2023-05-08 08:08:30 was meant to be 10 shows, bumped up to 50
general 2023-05-08 08:08:54 people during rehearsals said he wasn't acting right
general 2023-05-08 08:09:20 if this is it never happened he'd probably be alive today

general 2023-05-08 10:59:43 pc2 delay announcement confirmed
general 2023-05-08 11:00:16 celebration of waiting all these years for 1 roblox game
general 2023-05-08 11:00:27 only to wait more
general 2023-05-08 11:01:12 we all do
general 2023-05-09 14:27:10 weren't you banned here last
general 2023-05-09 14:27:20 on your main
general 2023-05-09 14:28:07 how long was the ban
general 2023-05-09 14:34:33 what the hell is that
general 2023-05-09 14:36:50 at this point there is absolutely no way pc2 will be worth the wait
general 2023-05-09 14:37:09 better off just thinking that it's a joke
general 2023-05-09 14:39:58 from what i've heard, flightpoint isn't great
general 2023-05-09 15:04:57 is there a problem
general 2023-05-09 15:10:25 this is a terrible change, if this goes through random people can just search up your regular handle on other platforms and send you friend requests and shit
general 2023-05-09 15:10:42 if you decide to use the same one that is
general 2023-05-09 15:45:59 yeah that's shit
general 2023-05-10 01:20:36 this is restoration
general 2023-05-10 11:28:45 that is true
general 2023-05-10 14:00:36 french revolution
general 2023-05-10 14:01:01 obviously
general 2023-05-10 14:01:57 the tph multis are such a confusing mess
general 2023-05-10 14:02:03 worst ones i've ever worked with
general 2023-05-10 14:04:54 please
general 2023-05-11 06:43:04 more rare shit
general 2023-05-11 06:43:17 last mj song produced by teddy riley
general 2023-05-11 06:43:32 was replaced by another song on invincible
general 2023-05-11 06:44:06 ended up getting released on the single release of "cry"
general 2023-05-11 06:44:15 only on specific copies
general 2023-05-11 06:44:52 i don't really like it but it's rare
general 2023-05-11 06:45:53 can tell it's very different from the darkchild stuff on invincible
general 2023-05-11 06:48:35 invincible is his worst album imo
general 2023-05-11 06:49:06 it's not a bad album but there's just stuff there i don't even want to hear
general 2023-05-11 06:49:18 there are real bangers on invincible
general 2023-05-11 09:49:51 audacity filter curve goes crazy
general 2023-05-11 12:44:58 a lot of r&d to achieve this quality
general 2023-05-11 12:45:37 the specs:
general 2023-05-11 12:54:39 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1106202126675353601/6vKn.gif
general 2023-05-11 12:56:15 that episode was hilarious lmao
general 2023-05-11 12:57:11 the way he turned into the thriller music video look
general 2023-05-11 12:57:37 jacket and all
general 2023-05-11 13:02:43 anyway more rarities
general 2023-05-11 13:03:35 i have a demo of in the closet but the song is a bit much for the server
general 2023-05-11 13:08:13 yeah i'm really glad it was changed
general 2023-05-11 13:08:37 also the quality is shit and idk what the source was
general 2023-05-11 13:09:25 some composer's demo that i didn't know about
general 2023-05-11 13:09:32 shit quality
general 2023-05-11 13:09:54 i don't even know about half of these things i have i just downloaded them from the archive
general 2023-05-11 13:10:13 mhm
general 2023-05-11 13:10:23 i think some of these are recordings from seminars
general 2023-05-11 13:10:30 or old worn out tape or some shit
general 2023-05-11 13:11:11 the composer's demo for break of dawn has really bad sound quality
general 2023-05-11 13:12:09 only decent quality one there is the butterflies composer's demo since that was actually officially released
general 2023-05-11 13:12:43 
general 2023-05-11 13:13:46 yeah that's how it is
general 2023-05-11 13:14:15 the snippets for this one unreleased song from invincible are really shitty
general 2023-05-11 13:15:08 the joys of seminar recordings
general 2023-05-11 13:15:33 not as bad as this one thing i listened to
general 2023-05-11 13:15:41 i think it was a version of streetwalker
general 2023-05-11 13:17:20 https://youtu.be/yML64T9BWDE fuck this is worse than i remember lmao
general 2023-05-11 13:17:34 this is the "higher quality" version
general 2023-05-11 13:17:41 i'd hate to hear the lower quality one
general 2023-05-11 13:18:03 this must've been recorded from the brad seminar
general 2023-05-11 13:18:58 someone uploaded all the snippets from gywoom so i downloaded them all
general 2023-05-11 13:19:06 nothing is consistent here
general 2023-05-11 13:20:27 this is the quality range we have
general 2023-05-11 13:23:27 last one i actually care about
general 2023-05-11 13:25:31 shit i lied cause dangerous always on top
general 2023-05-11 13:25:44 earth song goes all the way back to 1988
general 2023-05-11 13:26:58 fuck there was this document in the nintendo leaks which outlined nintendo's plan to stalk this one hacker
general 2023-05-11 13:27:01 creepy shit
general 2023-05-11 13:27:15 they knew tons of info
general 2023-05-11 13:37:49 audacity will hate me
general 2023-05-11 13:37:53 74 tracks
general 2023-05-11 13:45:14 this is what happens when you try to import 74 tracks into audacity but it's too laggy to do anything
general 2023-05-11 13:45:40 all the tracks were lined up already so idk
general 2023-05-11 13:45:47 some parts of it go kinda hard
general 2023-05-11 14:10:11 i'd have to actually look at what morfix said to properly form an opinion
general 2023-05-11 14:46:01 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1096649913938493490/dangerous.gif
general 2023-05-11 14:46:37 the stupid new mobile layout is so shit
general 2023-05-11 14:46:49 they did?
general 2023-05-11 14:47:04 i haven't properly checked spotify in a long while
general 2023-05-11 14:47:13 since i don't really use it anymore
general 2023-05-11 14:48:28 yeah i don't really see any change
general 2023-05-11 14:56:09 i didn't know spotify actually had the cry cover art
general 2023-05-11 14:56:17 no cd scans
general 2023-05-12 00:05:04 dangerous is literally based on streetwalker
general 2023-05-12 00:05:31 this is the demo with the streetwalker bass though, the final teddy riley one is different
general 2023-05-12 00:05:59 both the demo and streetwalker were produced by bill bottrell
general 2023-05-12 03:13:40 <@370594904268734464> it arrived holy shit
general 2023-05-12 03:14:04 not opening it yet

general 2023-05-13 15:12:27 some tabloid junkie version i've never heard before idk
general 2023-05-13 15:12:29 might be rare
general 2023-05-13 15:13:08 i can even hear the smpte tone in the beginning
general 2023-05-13 15:13:15 also it's the original speed

general 2023-05-13 15:47:49 pug was meant to be banned before he left
general 2023-05-13 15:47:53 but mods never checked
general 2023-05-14 02:39:50 devolved further beyond how it was before

general 2023-05-14 03:31:40 also i keep everything in album order
general 2023-05-14 03:33:31 the leaked newly done instrumental mix is shit
general 2023-05-14 03:33:35 the snare has no punch
general 2023-05-14 03:34:40 
general 2023-05-14 03:35:43 i can't be bothered converting to mp3
general 2023-05-14 03:35:47 too much effort
general 2023-05-14 04:09:21 yeah i’m not into any of this at all
general 2023-05-14 13:21:25 not a fan tbh
general 2023-05-14 13:39:58 high quality snippet of the v1 mix of superfly
general 2023-05-14 13:40:19 this implies the existence of an official instrumental and the full v1 mix
general 2023-05-14 13:41:38 night you were literally just being weird
general 2023-05-14 13:42:19 there's a line between a little joke and just being plain annoying or weird
general 2023-05-14 13:42:52 if i was ssen i would've blocked ngl
general 2023-05-14 13:43:21 i would not want to deal with that
general 2023-05-14 13:43:49 nah all good
general 2023-05-14 14:23:28 a dumpster fire
general 2023-05-14 14:23:59 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/841439608373379082/1105173762195865680/hood_mj.mp4
general 2023-05-16 14:56:16 great pin
general 2023-05-18 13:39:55 when the leaked version of the song sounds better than the officially released version on thriller 40
general 2023-05-18 13:40:08 that's how you know the estate fucked up the release
general 2023-05-18 13:41:55 you can't make this shit up the full song leaked in a better state than the released version (not even the full thing)
general 2023-05-18 13:42:51 it's john branca estate stuff i don't really care (they already got leaked and i bought the album already)
general 2023-05-18 13:43:20 
general 2023-05-18 13:46:28 oh yeah i managed to get the other rough mix for jam in high quality
general 2023-05-18 13:46:36 only had number 3 before
general 2023-05-19 12:10:52 the sound ever
general 2023-05-19 12:11:13 the smpte tones are included in the instrument pack idk why
general 2023-05-19 12:13:33 even though it says rtt it's not even included in the remember the time instruments folder
general 2023-05-19 12:13:39 this was from the ghosts folder
general 2023-05-19 12:13:46 
general 2023-05-19 12:43:53 alright time to put all the steps back
general 2023-05-19 14:26:16 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1108293160360222770/botdf.gif
general 2023-05-19 15:57:45 rod temperature
general 2023-05-19 15:58:03 i have it
general 2023-05-19 15:59:44 it's 2am and i was just dying at this and the earth day post
general 2023-05-19 16:00:22 the guy
general 2023-05-19 16:00:31 did like nothing
general 2023-05-19 16:00:41 
general 2023-05-20 14:51:56 michael jackson estate just casually spreading misinfo on their website
general 2023-05-20 14:52:02 average estate activities
general 2023-05-20 14:52:25 yeah number 15 didn't even exist lmao
general 2023-05-20 14:52:29 it was a poem
general 2023-05-20 14:52:42 it was never on the album
general 2023-05-20 14:53:44 correction - it was in the booklet
general 2023-05-20 14:54:13 but on the website it's being treated as an actual song
general 2023-05-20 14:54:59 i don't even know how they managed to get supafly sister instead of superfly sister
general 2023-05-20 14:55:35 superfly sister
general 2023-05-20 14:56:49 best part is that they're literally selling the album on the store and it's spelt right there
general 2023-05-20 14:58:09 oh i didn't realise i could actually get xscape deluxe and invincible on the official store
general 2023-05-21 15:34:30 now that was a time
general 2023-05-22 12:15:40 the
general 2023-05-22 12:15:43 invincibible
general 2023-05-22 12:15:56 buy now
general 2023-05-22 15:25:56 just don't play war thunder at all
general 2023-05-22 15:26:00 easy solution
general 2023-05-22 15:58:00 that reminds me
general 2023-05-22 15:58:07 i should finish my multitrack archive
general 2023-05-22 16:03:46 how are you extracting models from plane crazy?
general 2023-05-22 16:04:18 are you just sort of running a program in the background to do this
general 2023-05-22 16:06:50 oh
general 2023-05-22 16:06:55 that's not extraction then
general 2023-05-22 16:09:22 i don't even know how studio works
general 2023-05-22 16:09:36 does it have an option to export to obj or the sort
general 2023-05-22 16:09:54 ah
general 2023-05-22 16:11:18 nah
general 2023-05-22 16:12:16 i know that some guy was making paper models from extracted original starfox models
general 2023-05-22 16:12:37 actual extractions from the game rom
general 2023-05-22 16:13:34 a custom tool had to be made for the original starfox games - they were on the snes so it was all custom
general 2023-05-22 16:15:10 the only sort of standard thing going on with those games were how the models were in videoscape format before being exported into a usable state with a proprietary tool
general 2023-05-22 16:16:10 argonaut's "shaped" tool
general 2023-05-22 16:16:28 specifically made for starfox 1
general 2023-05-22 16:16:58 that itself was a prototype for something that ran on the hardware itself, and that evolved into a big workstation program
general 2023-05-22 16:17:45 only visual evidence of the workstation tool from back then
general 2023-05-22 16:19:52 yeah?
general 2023-05-22 16:20:41 i would work on the multitrack archive now but it's on my pc
general 2023-05-22 16:21:16 i'm on my laptop and running low on storage, i don't want to dedicate 80gb on my laptop to the multis
general 2023-05-22 16:22:11 i've only got a few on here but they're the ones that are actually worth it
general 2023-05-22 16:22:32 scream is actually the flyte tyme remix so it's misleading
general 2023-05-23 01:03:35 better uses of time than war thunder
general 2023-05-23 01:03:49 still shit
general 2023-05-23 04:42:52 it's better to not have any hope for pc2
general 2023-05-23 04:43:14 stop spreading misinfo, it's never been officially stated that it's been cancelled
general 2023-05-23 04:43:28 but i wouldn't be surprised if an announcement comes
general 2023-05-23 04:43:47 short answer is that we don't know
general 2023-05-23 04:43:53 we're left in the dark
general 2023-05-23 04:44:02 but i doubt it'll come out
general 2023-05-23 04:44:15 fuck no
general 2023-05-23 04:44:33 that's weird as shit
general 2023-05-23 04:47:35 managed to acquire the multitracks for the knowledge
general 2023-05-23 04:47:43 probably the rarest ones i own
general 2023-05-23 04:49:13 i'm not a big fan of the rhythm nation album cause it's not really my style
general 2023-05-23 04:49:53 but i love the usage of the emax 2 sampler
general 2023-05-23 04:50:24 and just all the old samplers present in the album
general 2023-05-23 06:34:38 mk1 💪
general 2023-05-23 06:35:15 idk why they had to go for a full on reboot of mk
general 2023-05-23 06:35:25 or why it's over 100gb
general 2023-05-23 06:36:09 no more big limitations so they aren't heavily optimising stuff anymore
general 2023-05-23 06:36:54 game will still probably be good
general 2023-05-23 06:37:08 ed boon has been working on mk games since the 1st one
general 2023-05-23 06:38:08 what the fuck
general 2023-05-23 06:38:54 at this point you can only afford to have a few games on your pc max
general 2023-05-23 06:39:45 sad to see netherrealm go down this route
general 2023-05-23 06:42:26 everyone was complaining about the increased price tag on totk but meanwhile in australia it's cheaper than botw
general 2023-05-23 06:45:10 zelda twilight princess aged poorly in terms of graphics
general 2023-05-23 06:45:23 windwaker came out with the gamecube and it looks timeless
general 2023-05-23 06:46:43 yeah it still does
general 2023-05-23 06:49:57 oh my god i'm finally done
general 2023-05-23 06:52:08 tears of the kingdom is only 16gb
general 2023-05-23 06:53:02 it's baffling how they managed that
general 2023-05-23 06:53:13 considering it's way bigger than breath of the wild
general 2023-05-23 06:53:49 then again the graphics in both games are aiming for the switch in terms of performance
general 2023-05-24 13:22:56 caught in 216x28
general 2023-05-25 04:55:55 i love the 2bad instrument set
general 2023-05-25 05:01:23 here's the actual instrumental
general 2023-05-25 05:01:31 i used ripped samples for that before
general 2023-05-25 11:21:04 pre order invincibowl
general 2023-05-25 11:49:31 so expensive
general 2023-05-25 11:49:53 real products
general 2023-05-25 11:53:12 gaslighting people into thinking this is a real product
general 2023-05-25 11:54:33 
general 2023-05-25 11:58:07 pre order invincibowl

general 2023-05-26 03:22:54 joining this hellhole when you're under 13 is one of the worst decisions
general 2023-05-26 04:19:41 morfix you're literally the only one here rn trying to start shit
general 2023-05-26 04:20:22 mhm
general 2023-05-26 05:12:54 i don't think he's annoying
general 2023-05-26 08:51:31 i’m opening this cause i think the glue has probably dried out from being sealed for over 30 years
general 2023-05-26 11:03:04 need digital files
general 2023-05-26 11:03:10 better quality and more stuff
general 2023-05-26 11:03:38 only recently has the entire moving shadow back catalogue been put up on spotify
general 2023-05-26 13:05:24 ai stem separation is getting really good
general 2023-05-26 13:05:35 hi
general 2023-05-26 13:11:26 i tested out demucs4 with the original la reid demo of slave to the rhythm and the vocal track is so clean
general 2023-05-26 13:24:31 
general 2023-05-26 13:29:56 
general 2023-05-26 13:34:31 who decided to include the song shout on the cry single of all things
general 2023-05-26 13:34:48 it gets weirder too since streetwalker was on some copies
general 2023-05-26 13:35:16 it's a good song, but why on cry of all things?
general 2023-05-26 13:36:22 
general 2023-05-26 13:36:24 (i don't really like cry)
general 2023-05-26 13:36:42 2 polar opposite songs
general 2023-05-26 13:56:19 the acquisition <@370594904268734464>
general 2023-05-26 13:57:18 glue did end up drying out on 3 of them so i had to reapply
general 2023-05-27 02:38:33 why are you one of the only people who ping the mods when something extremely minor happens
general 2023-05-27 02:39:06 ^
general 2023-05-27 13:06:27 only acceptable fedora is the smooth criminal one
general 2023-05-27 13:06:32 or the dangerous one
general 2023-05-27 13:06:37 or the you rock my world one
general 2023-05-27 13:30:18 should i buy the invincible album (and 2 other things)
general 2023-05-27 13:30:54 those 2 other things are the cry cd single and xscape deluxe
general 2023-05-27 13:31:32 i don't want to buy bad 25 cause the mixing is horrible on it
general 2023-05-27 13:32:03 cry single has streetwalker which is the only song i'm interested in on bad25
general 2023-05-27 13:32:30 as well as a crusty version of the cry music video (cd rom)
general 2023-05-27 13:45:22 how do people have this shit
general 2023-05-27 13:45:26 how the fuck
general 2023-05-27 13:46:19 no this is an internal epic records thing
general 2023-05-27 13:47:51 oh wait the guy who originally sold it worked at epic records and was in charge of the marketing for thriller, bad, and dangerous
general 2023-05-27 13:47:53 makes sense now
general 2023-05-27 13:49:10 making a real invincibowl is more worth it
general 2023-05-28 04:00:33 vinyl for what
general 2023-05-28 04:00:44 like for a specific album?
general 2023-05-28 04:01:01 well yeah i got a bunch but no real turntable
general 2023-05-28 04:02:21 sorry if i came off as a little rude
general 2023-05-28 04:04:16 only got one that was part of an 80s hifi stack and an early 70s all in one unit

general 2023-05-29 12:53:47 hardest videos
general 2023-05-29 12:55:05 the other one being this 4 minute weird mj fanmade music video shit with the song butterflies
general 2023-05-29 12:55:11 it's laughably bad
general 2023-05-30 03:02:53 i wouldn't say so
general 2023-05-30 10:53:38 it shouldn't have to be like that
general 2023-05-30 10:56:06 new shit
general 2023-05-30 10:58:06 not even on the tracker spreadsheet so you know it's good
general 2023-05-30 11:02:36 more
general 2023-05-30 11:02:53 also acquired 2 more things for rtt
general 2023-05-30 11:07:24 ex zodiac:
general 2023-05-30 11:07:39 genuinely one of the best games i've played in a while
general 2023-05-30 11:11:36 funny how this all started over an actual complaint about pc
general 2023-05-30 11:12:30 in all seriousness rick really needs to get everything together
general 2023-05-30 11:13:33 no updates for pc1, barely any info about pc2
general 2023-05-30 11:13:43 essentially just leaving everyone in the dark again
general 2023-05-30 11:14:19 i don't care about pc but change needs to happen, and fast
general 2023-05-30 11:15:11 yeah i've had enough of it
general 2023-05-30 11:16:54 too many excuses and delays, credibility is really being brought into question
general 2023-05-30 11:18:04 and pc2 has supposedly been in development for years? yeah i'm not buying it
general 2023-05-30 11:19:53 the lava video from *last year* looks very barebones, but that could just be how that location is
general 2023-05-30 11:20:04 there has been nothing new shared for 8 months
general 2023-05-30 11:24:01 https://tenor.com/view/michael-branca-album-branca-gif-27133823
general 2023-05-30 11:24:07 branca 🙏
general 2023-05-30 11:34:25 that's for the mods
general 2023-05-30 11:34:50 if a mod pulls him up that's what he has to do
general 2023-05-30 11:44:53 yes because of course he has time to go look through pings and give people image perms
general 2023-05-30 11:45:03 we do not have a bot which gives image perms
general 2023-05-30 11:45:27 (image perms are given at level 3)
general 2023-05-30 11:45:58 yeah for general you need an expert rank
general 2023-05-30 11:51:12 tasmania isn't real
general 2023-05-30 11:52:55 visual representation of the mythology surrounding tasmania
general 2023-05-30 11:53:10 was made before it was proven to not exist
general 2023-05-30 11:53:52 tasmania as a whole is fake
general 2023-05-30 11:54:10 just a huge wall surrounding some water
general 2023-05-30 11:54:19 that's all it is
general 2023-05-30 11:54:47 must be
general 2023-05-30 12:14:38 there's no way tailed would be on that fake place cause he would operate in the same timezone as me
general 2023-05-30 12:14:57 also hipster isn't in tas iirc
general 2023-05-30 14:12:51 aren't you like
general 2023-05-30 14:12:54 not meant to do that
general 2023-05-30 14:13:22 ah okay
general 2023-05-30 14:13:45 i didn't know that mods could allow random people to unde check
general 2023-05-30 14:14:07 that was always strictly for the mods for privacy reasons
general 2023-05-30 14:14:15 which was just proven now
general 2023-05-31 00:36:43 this right here
general 2023-05-31 00:42:51 
general 2023-05-31 00:42:59 better product than what the estate can make
general 2023-05-31 13:02:23 for good reason
general 2023-05-31 13:03:39 furries i have no problem with
general 2023-05-31 13:03:44 oders though
general 2023-05-31 13:03:46 why
general 2023-05-31 13:03:54 it's unbelieveable
general 2023-05-31 13:04:01 it's even in the mod manual
general 2023-05-31 13:04:20 source - i have the mod manual
general 2023-05-31 13:04:41 i've got no clue
general 2023-05-31 13:04:53 it was part of a leak
general 2023-05-31 13:06:39 right in the category list
general 2023-05-31 13:22:36 facebook marketplace is so good
general 2023-05-31 13:23:16 not in that way
general 2023-05-31 13:23:27 why did i still have that copied
general 2023-05-31 13:23:43 
general 2023-05-31 13:23:56 most useful products

general 2023-05-31 13:26:50 actual deal
general 2023-05-31 13:28:36 set you free cd single is taking so long to download
general 2023-05-31 13:28:52 well the original single release
general 2023-05-31 13:53:09 invincible has been charting for 7 days holy shit
general 2023-05-31 13:53:49 wonder what darkchild or the estate thinks of that
general 2023-05-31 13:58:20 should be left to the mods
general 2023-05-31 13:58:35 infact it always was left to the mods
general 2023-05-31 13:58:54 what did he do
general 2023-05-31 13:59:24 <@866848584888877077> this true?
general 2023-05-31 13:59:47 i really doubt a mod would just let someone do this
general 2023-05-31 13:59:50 ah well
general 2023-05-31 14:00:19 it was never like that
general 2023-05-31 14:00:21 ever
general 2023-05-31 14:00:35 i don't see why that would change
general 2023-05-31 14:02:40 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1108293160360222770/botdf.gif
general 2023-05-31 14:02:59 almost sent the entire botdf music video as a gif
general 2023-05-31 14:03:14 server will throw a fit about it much like in the closet
general 2023-05-31 14:03:37 in the closet is definitely worse by a lot
general 2023-05-31 14:03:49 https://tenor.com/view/get-groovd-michael-jackson-mjinnocent-mj-i-love-mj-gif-20012898
general 2023-05-31 14:04:59 fair enough
general 2023-05-31 14:07:13 yes because you're totally in charge of it
general 2023-05-31 14:07:20 and not the moderation team
general 2023-05-31 14:07:59 "apparently"
general 2023-05-31 14:08:04 where the hell is the proof
general 2023-05-31 14:08:16 there's fuck all to show for it
general 2023-05-31 14:09:59 that's a one off thing
general 2023-05-31 14:10:04 also fuzzy should not be doing that
general 2023-05-31 14:10:30 that process should be restricted to mods, as it always was
general 2023-05-31 14:10:54 because they know how to handle the responsibility better
general 2023-05-31 14:11:37 plus for privacy reasons (sooty totally didn't send a screenshot of him checking someone here)
general 2023-05-31 14:11:59 i for one would not trust someone who did that
general 2023-05-31 14:12:10 too risky
general 2023-05-31 14:12:52 no you don't
general 2023-05-31 14:13:02 ^
general 2023-05-31 14:13:05 this happened
general 2023-05-31 14:14:57 seyo shit has gone off the rails
general 2023-05-31 14:16:02 does he know
general 2023-05-31 14:16:39 more shit
general 2023-05-31 14:17:15 i'd kill for the full version of can't let her get away
general 2023-05-31 14:17:28 the song
general 2023-05-31 14:17:31 the fucking song
general 2023-05-31 14:17:42 it's right here
general 2023-05-31 14:18:03 you don't have to care about whatever i have to say
general 2023-05-31 14:18:32 also that message was meant to go after the audio but it got delayed
general 2023-05-31 14:19:00 no that's not seyo
general 2023-05-31 14:19:08 different user
general 2023-05-31 14:19:16 uh
general 2023-05-31 14:19:17 not real
general 2023-05-31 14:21:18 this is not seyo
general 2023-05-31 14:21:28 i had seyo added
general 2023-05-31 14:23:14 a bit of preproduction from the ghosts short film
general 2023-05-31 14:23:41 glorious .mpg format
general 2023-06-01 01:24:43 no way lmao
general 2023-06-01 09:40:11 it is what it is
general 2023-06-01 09:41:40 nice
general 2023-06-01 09:41:57 my laptop has 12gb of ram lmao
general 2023-06-01 09:42:29 has the original 8gb stick and a 4gb that i salvaged from another laptop
general 2023-06-01 09:42:40 same laptop but it was for parts
general 2023-06-01 09:42:47 it’s so funny
general 2023-06-01 09:43:05 but more ram so i can’t complain
general 2023-06-01 09:43:20 was only running on a single 8gb stick before
general 2023-06-01 09:48:35 debating on whether i open the invincible cd i bought
general 2023-06-01 09:48:54 it's an original pressing and i got it for like 16 bucks lol
general 2023-06-01 09:57:51 i hate megasync and its terrible implementation of a file browser
general 2023-06-01 10:00:17 finally
general 2023-06-01 10:00:23 it's actually starting
general 2023-06-01 10:08:07 this came from one of the future records studio discs but idk what track it is so i haven't properly named it
general 2023-06-01 10:09:26 have to group all of these cause it's spread between 3 folders on 2 drives atm
general 2023-06-01 10:09:39 this is weirdly low quality too
general 2023-06-01 10:10:23 i know basically nothing about the source except that it was a studio cd
general 2023-06-01 10:10:25 or tape idk
general 2023-06-01 10:11:29 a lot of them were sold by teddy riley in 2008 and stuff has been slowly getting out
general 2023-06-01 10:12:59 like very slowly
general 2023-06-01 10:14:59 this is everything just for jam
general 2023-06-01 10:18:13 only the tracks produced post teddy riley's inclusion on the team so none of the bryan loren tracks are in this form
general 2023-06-01 10:27:20 i got all the remember the time studio cd things in wav with the jam stuff as well
general 2023-06-01 11:44:00 should i open my invincible cd
general 2023-06-01 11:44:16 turns out it’s a sealed original pressing
general 2023-06-01 15:01:03 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1063530717142859847/1112899646499606588/bandicam_2023-05-27_19-03-20-194.mp4
general 2023-06-01 15:01:32 earth song but epic
general 2023-06-02 03:44:02 most music ever created
general 2023-06-02 03:44:07 2000 watts 💪
general 2023-06-02 04:04:11 another classic listing

general 2023-06-02 04:06:31 this is the most device ever
general 2023-06-02 13:59:42 well that just happened
general 2023-06-02 13:59:52 personally i have no issues with ssen
general 2023-06-02 14:02:59 this literally happening over this shit?
general 2023-06-02 14:03:11 wow
general 2023-06-02 14:04:38 i think my earbuds are getting worn out
general 2023-06-02 14:04:39 sad
general 2023-06-02 14:05:03 doesn't have the same punch as it used to have
general 2023-06-02 14:54:48 no
general 2023-06-02 15:12:29 
general 2023-06-02 15:13:32 effects of sminking
general 2023-06-02 16:10:17 fix it
general 2023-06-03 07:08:15 reposting the same screenshot over and over again is not useful
general 2023-06-03 07:18:20 none of you are any good at this
general 2023-06-03 07:19:04 i don’t even know how it started
general 2023-06-03 07:19:41 is that really it
general 2023-06-03 07:19:45 oh my god
general 2023-06-03 07:23:25 this will literally get you warned btw
general 2023-06-03 07:24:17 yep
general 2023-06-03 07:24:29 mostly moved to another server though
general 2023-06-03 07:25:01 mj server
general 2023-06-03 07:28:48 what
general 2023-06-03 07:35:42 
general 2023-06-03 07:36:14 the history sessions version of ghosts
general 2023-06-03 07:40:43 no disinfo
general 2023-06-03 07:41:23 yeah i wouldn't be surprised at all if it turns out that pc2 is cancelled
general 2023-06-03 07:52:27 i mean you (sooty) were literally telling him suicide methods
general 2023-06-03 07:52:43 and saying that he should do them
general 2023-06-03 07:57:18 to think this all started over a pfp of all things
general 2023-06-03 07:57:34 the most minor shit
general 2023-06-03 08:00:07 got a really high quality version of this place hotel
general 2023-06-04 03:49:02 the truth
general 2023-06-04 04:18:09 you aren't even in there
general 2023-06-04 04:34:43 highly doubt that
general 2023-06-04 04:38:22 shitty instrumental of privacy
general 2023-06-04 04:42:40 that gets annoying and i'm not even affected by it
general 2023-06-04 04:43:15 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1110822495113711636/invinciblecube.gif

general 2023-06-04 05:01:48 just leave it
general 2023-06-04 05:07:37 why are you posting old shit
general 2023-06-04 05:12:05 i'm shocked at how good this ai separated instrumental is
general 2023-06-04 05:12:12 there's no point
general 2023-06-04 05:12:33 you're just bringing up old screenshots
general 2023-06-04 05:13:23 things have really come a long way, demucs4 is definitelly better than 3
general 2023-06-04 05:13:33 what is it
general 2023-06-04 05:14:31 old outdated screenshots just to make fun of some guy who probably isn't here anymore
general 2023-06-04 05:14:32 why
general 2023-06-04 05:14:49 just starting shit for the sake of it
general 2023-06-04 05:15:25 died a long time ago
general 2023-06-04 05:16:32 not even going to bother responding to this since you're pretty much just starting shit for the sake of it
general 2023-06-04 05:17:48 this is not about him, you just sent outdated screenshots while he wasn't even arguing
general 2023-06-04 05:17:51 holy shit
general 2023-06-04 05:18:19 i don't even know
general 2023-06-04 05:19:10 there was no need
general 2023-06-04 05:19:29 i'm sure everybody here is familiar
general 2023-06-04 05:21:26 anyway full blue gangsta
general 2023-06-04 05:21:48 we don't say that here
general 2023-06-04 05:22:06 now what does autism have to do with all of this
general 2023-06-04 05:22:34 dumpster fire
general 2023-06-04 05:22:58 so glad i'm being less active here
general 2023-06-04 05:24:19 don't have to be autistic to be like that
general 2023-06-04 06:09:51 it's finished
general 2023-06-04 06:10:09 so true
general 2023-06-04 06:20:35 are you trying to get him banned or something
general 2023-06-04 06:35:53 i think i just accidentally made a successful recreation of the full version of privacy
general 2023-06-04 06:36:20 pirate irony
general 2023-06-04 06:39:27 
general 2023-06-04 06:39:49 that doesn't work here so you're lucky
general 2023-06-04 06:41:03 the timing between different releases of this song is weird
general 2023-06-04 06:41:20 i've seen 3 different slightly different speeds
general 2023-06-04 06:41:30 why
general 2023-06-04 06:42:03 it's like the smallest difference but it made this such a pain the first time i tried
general 2023-06-04 06:42:42 leaked vocal multitracks run at a different speed compared to the album version, different pressings of the album have a small time difference
general 2023-06-04 06:42:50 no
general 2023-06-04 06:43:03 this is a michael jackson song from invincible
general 2023-06-04 06:43:16 but none of it is mixed properly so it sounds shit
general 2023-06-04 06:44:43 actual decent example of something i've done with multitracks
general 2023-06-04 06:44:51 original mix of scream before it was edited down for the album
general 2023-06-04 06:45:29 couple things had to be fixed cause i used leaked stems and multitracks from the flyte tyme remix
general 2023-06-04 06:46:29 michael jackson of course
general 2023-06-04 06:46:48 but the stems were fundamentally flawed and therefore the official mixes had issues
general 2023-06-04 06:47:09 so i had to edit them down and redo
general 2023-06-04 06:47:59 have to say that this sounds like shit cause i was experimenting
general 2023-06-04 06:48:23 i have the leaked 7 vocal tracks but i used an exported version of them with no tweaks
general 2023-06-04 06:49:14 
general 2023-06-04 06:49:53 also the instrumental i used was ai separated so it sounds off
general 2023-06-04 06:50:51 best attempt i've done though
general 2023-06-04 06:51:33 aside from just using this track for all the vocals
general 2023-06-04 06:52:56 actually haven't done that
general 2023-06-04 06:53:26 i know there's an official mashup of botdf and dangerous
general 2023-06-04 06:56:28 there's also the full 6 minute version of you are not alone but that's not interesting
general 2023-06-04 06:57:21 
general 2023-06-04 06:57:46 every song from the history album with leaked stems or multitracks always ends up being edited down for the album
general 2023-06-04 06:58:28 full version of 2 bad is the best
general 2023-06-04 07:26:29 in the process of altering the leaked vocal tracks to fit with the final vocals
general 2023-06-04 07:27:57 nope
general 2023-06-04 07:35:03 i do not want to lose all my progress
general 2023-06-04 08:08:53 wip (again)
general 2023-06-04 08:09:04 this time with the individual vocal tracks
general 2023-06-04 08:09:22 still sounds bad but oh well
general 2023-06-04 08:30:47 
general 2023-06-04 08:35:06 this is it for now
general 2023-06-04 09:53:44 peak products from the mj estate
general 2023-06-04 09:54:08 read the description
general 2023-06-04 09:57:24 yeah the estate makes the best products
general 2023-06-04 09:57:26 they are all real
general 2023-06-04 12:52:02 damn invincible is still charting
general 2023-06-04 12:58:33 it's gmt+10 now
general 2023-06-04 13:10:14 discord is running slow
general 2023-06-04 13:11:12 i'm still surprised at how well the recreation of the full version of privacy turned out
general 2023-06-04 13:11:42 was actually better than i thought
general 2023-06-04 13:11:58 assumed i would run into a lot of timing issues
general 2023-06-04 13:13:59 discord is running slow
general 2023-06-04 13:19:13 i'm not going out at 11pm
general 2023-06-04 13:25:19 predictable
general 2023-06-04 13:36:03 
general 2023-06-04 13:36:46 get your weight off of me (most overrated unleaked track)
general 2023-06-04 13:39:13 (i need 7 digits)
general 2023-06-04 13:42:09 shitty bryan loren dangerous track
general 2023-06-04 13:43:23 couldn't care less about don't believe it
general 2023-06-04 13:43:50 i do not want this at all (stop repeating messages discord)
general 2023-06-04 13:44:34 shitty bryan loren dangerous track
general 2023-06-04 13:46:06 trying to sing 2000 watts
general 2023-06-04 13:50:29 ended so well, someone started singing shout
general 2023-06-04 14:20:34 surprised to see you here
general 2023-06-04 14:21:45 so true
general 2023-06-04 14:24:25 truly the event ever
general 2023-06-04 15:15:29 from my experience it's extremely important to not just be free to do whatever
general 2023-06-04 15:15:39 you need direction
general 2023-06-04 15:16:02 otherwise ideas would get muddled up and the scope might get too big
general 2023-06-04 15:16:41 this is the whole point of pc2
general 2023-06-04 15:16:49 pc2 is starting from scratch
general 2023-06-04 15:16:58 complete rewrite of the game
general 2023-06-04 15:18:22 yandere simulator was affected by misguided priorities and quite frankly bad coding
general 2023-06-04 15:18:26 this is different
general 2023-06-04 15:19:25 yanderedev focused on adding stupid easter eggs instead of actually working on the main part of the game
general 2023-06-04 15:20:02 i think so
general 2023-06-04 15:21:15 and the quality of the bulk of the code was questionable at best
general 2023-06-04 15:21:22 incredible performance
general 2023-06-04 15:27:10 you saying that to me or
general 2023-06-04 15:29:36 he would get absolutely swamped by everyone here
general 2023-06-04 15:29:50 that's why he can't talk
general 2023-06-04 15:30:53 people will ping him here and try to ask questions
general 2023-06-04 15:33:27 
general 2023-06-04 15:33:53 post invincible work
general 2023-06-04 15:33:55 rare
general 2023-06-04 15:37:29 there is just development
general 2023-06-04 15:37:46 it varies depending on a lot of factors
general 2023-06-04 15:38:29 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1110822495113711636/invinciblecube.gif
general 2023-06-04 15:39:39 from my experience it just continues until it feels "right"
general 2023-06-04 15:40:22 stop trying to get recognised as an officially sanctioned minimod
general 2023-06-04 15:40:45 we've already got enough minimods as is, in my opinion at least
general 2023-06-05 01:12:16 ^
general 2023-06-05 01:13:19 some people don’t know when to just drop things
general 2023-06-05 01:15:35 even if he gets banned he’ll just come back 3 days later
general 2023-06-05 01:15:41 there’s no point
general 2023-06-05 01:17:31 the difference is that he dropped it, and is not going on about it now
general 2023-06-05 01:19:11 when did this even happen
general 2023-06-05 01:19:47 the image lol
general 2023-06-05 01:20:06 wait i forgot the search function exists
general 2023-06-05 01:20:59 oh that was over a month ago lol
general 2023-06-05 01:49:11 the block button:
general 2023-06-05 01:49:55 you’re going out of your way to see what he’s saying
general 2023-06-05 01:50:02 lol
general 2023-06-05 01:50:38 no i’m talking about sooty
general 2023-06-05 01:50:56 he has you blocked but he’s still going lol
general 2023-06-05 01:51:18 it literally has
general 2023-06-05 01:52:18 yeah i’ve had enough
general 2023-06-05 02:01:25 wtf lmao
general 2023-06-05 04:03:05 gonna have to redo the instrumental for the full version of privacy
general 2023-06-05 04:03:11 really not liking my current one
general 2023-06-05 04:03:41 it just is
general 2023-06-05 04:23:37 i think the instrumental looppoint i have atm is perfect
general 2023-06-05 04:23:50 just need a higher quality one and that means better tools
general 2023-06-05 04:55:35 why would you bring him into this
general 2023-06-05 04:55:37 it's over
general 2023-06-05 06:47:42 so glad
general 2023-06-05 07:29:34 i've heavily improved the full version of privacy
general 2023-06-05 07:29:39 instrumental is way better
general 2023-06-05 09:37:39 instrumental completely redone and a couple tweaks
general 2023-06-05 12:37:39 no
general 2023-06-05 12:38:41 had to do this new version on my desktop so there's no post processing
general 2023-06-05 12:45:58 got the instrumental of this new version though so i can keep working on it
general 2023-06-05 13:38:31 no more
general 2023-06-05 13:38:34 i'm done unless i get really bothered about something here and go to change it
general 2023-06-05 13:39:01 managed to switch all post processing off on my laptop
general 2023-06-05 14:37:43 going back again to redo the mix 💪
general 2023-06-05 14:37:44 again
general 2023-06-05 14:38:22 i've done this 3 times already
general 2023-06-05 14:39:48 i think i'm actually ok with it now
general 2023-06-05 14:39:50 impossible
general 2023-06-05 14:40:12 sounds really similar to v3 so not bothering with sending it
general 2023-06-05 14:47:45 ghetto smosh is dead
general 2023-06-05 14:48:09 actual cease and desist lmao
general 2023-06-05 15:10:45 can't wait to put out the mix yet again and then redo it again

general 2023-06-05 15:29:10 the difference is that i hate branca
general 2023-06-05 15:29:14 don't tell the estate
general 2023-06-05 15:32:21 i mean branca best lawyer can't wait for branca 40
general 2023-06-06 03:34:06 come to western australia you can get a lot of things for free
general 2023-06-06 03:34:12 some of it might be fixable idk
general 2023-06-06 03:34:27 (i don't live in wa)
general 2023-06-06 03:34:57 i'm so unfamiliar with car culture here tbh
general 2023-06-06 04:08:24 can vouch for layton
general 2023-06-06 04:08:52 aka polarranak, amoryesther, rodusk, etc.
general 2023-06-06 09:52:25 no vlc
general 2023-06-06 11:34:57 dr han
general 2023-06-06 11:35:58 he's true
general 2023-06-06 13:28:39 stop spreading disinformation
general 2023-06-06 13:28:50 it hasn't been cancelled
general 2023-06-06 13:29:16 work is still continuing - hyperbit came in chat yesterday and cleared up some stuff
general 2023-06-06 13:29:23 why should i
general 2023-06-06 13:29:49 but i won't be surprised if it actually ends up getting cancelled lmao i've got no hope
general 2023-06-06 13:30:52 mhm
general 2023-06-06 13:31:20 no, that "summer" announcement was ages ago
general 2023-06-06 13:31:25 it came and went with nothing
general 2023-06-06 13:33:38 i think i still have the gta 6 leaks saved
general 2023-06-06 13:34:45 1. i don't have a mirror up
2. rockstar will destroy my mega account if i do put it up
general 2023-06-06 13:35:02 but they're here
general 2023-06-06 13:35:20 task_commands is actually part of the gta 5 source iirc
general 2023-06-06 13:35:55 gta 6 debug footage
general 2023-06-06 13:36:47 i don't even care that much about gta i just wanted to archive it
general 2023-06-06 13:38:49 the michael jackson laptop leak was one of the only things that i really cared about
general 2023-06-06 13:38:55 backstory was wild
general 2023-06-06 13:45:26 basically someone who worked with mj, brad sundberg, was hosting a seminar in brussels

someone put up a fundraiser to buy tickets for the seminar with the goal of stealing unreleased songs and he succeeded
general 2023-06-06 13:46:18 took 1 of 2 laptops and an ssd but gave it all back after mirroring it
general 2023-06-06 13:46:48 literally just walked right in, took the stuff, jumped out of the window and ran across a roof
general 2023-06-06 13:48:37 and so this stuff leaked out
general 2023-06-06 13:49:01 
general 2023-06-06 13:52:14 there's another song from the HIStory sessions called the verdict in the leak but it's really barebones, 2 versions of it are in there infact. bryan loren track
general 2023-06-06 13:58:32 still waiting for ask rene 3 to leak
general 2023-06-07 09:38:58 kind of don't want to see someone's head being stomped on
general 2023-06-07 09:45:48 i don't fuck with that kind of logic
general 2023-06-07 09:45:51 still a person
general 2023-06-07 09:47:59 can't deny it
general 2023-06-07 09:50:05 no thanks
general 2023-06-07 09:50:08 i'll pass

general 2023-06-07 10:41:20 new
general 2023-06-07 10:41:42 the heat death of the universe
general 2023-06-07 10:50:00 fun fact - history is the only mj album to feature a racial slur (it's not said by michael don't worry)
general 2023-06-07 14:22:09 the unreleased mj song "faces" was made by hitting sticks together as well as bins and glass bottles
general 2023-06-07 14:22:25 i'm not even joking that's literally how parts of it were made
general 2023-06-07 14:23:05 
general 2023-06-07 14:23:10 there's studio footage of it
creations-chat 2023-06-07 15:40:09 no!! i only do stuff with audacity and mostly just play around with multitracks as opposed to remixing (also i suck at it)

also that reminds me, i should look at the stems for get on the floor cause that leaked (nvm it's incomplete)

i'm just a guy experimenting with leaked multitracks and audio and that's pretty much it lol
general 2023-06-07 15:52:24 no
general 2023-06-07 15:52:38 well not really
general 2023-06-07 15:52:53 idk
general 2023-06-07 15:52:57 i just experiment
general 2023-06-07 15:53:36 
general 2023-06-07 15:54:40 2 bad is honestly one of the best songs on the history album
general 2023-06-07 15:56:03 the history team (dallas austin, jimmy jam + terry lewis, rene moore) knocked it out of the park
general 2023-06-07 15:56:14 76 individual tracks
general 2023-06-07 16:02:07 there really are 76 tracks but the laptop leak is missing 2 kick drum tracks
general 2023-06-07 16:02:19 not a loss since 2 bad's multis have been leaked before
general 2023-06-08 04:11:27 not a bad game
general 2023-06-08 04:11:50 it’s actually pretty fun but gets boring quick when only going solo
general 2023-06-08 05:39:53 this is a song from the final fantasy series
general 2023-06-08 05:39:56 one winged angel
general 2023-06-08 05:40:32 yeah idk the exact version but it's that song
general 2023-06-08 05:48:14 damn the full stranger in moscow multitracks exist but only the radio edit has leaked
general 2023-06-08 05:48:25 i could probably just remake it
general 2023-06-08 06:01:48 nvm too hard
general 2023-06-08 06:04:57

general 2023-06-08 16:02:55 isn't that literally a raptv edit
general 2023-06-08 16:03:02 fucking hell lmao you fell for it
general 2023-06-08 16:04:02 wait is it?
general 2023-06-08 16:04:03 idk
general 2023-06-08 16:04:56 literally none of these websites are actually reliable
general 2023-06-08 16:05:55 the man himself made a video on it lmao
general 2023-06-08 16:06:17 it's all fake
general 2023-06-08 16:07:47 clip from demucs4 instrumental of the dangerous demo
general 2023-06-08 16:08:31 wasn't he spreading nsfw to his audience
general 2023-06-08 16:09:32 and the full thing (it's not perfect at all or even great)
general 2023-06-08 16:10:40 oh no
general 2023-06-08 16:10:46 that's not great
general 2023-06-08 16:12:36 dangerous demo with just the bass and drums is weird
general 2023-06-08 16:25:41 august 12 2036
general 2023-06-08 16:25:46 the heat death of the universe
general 2023-06-08 16:30:48 whiplash was a great movie
general 2023-06-08 16:31:21 i've watched it a few times
general 2023-06-08 16:32:24 tf
general 2023-06-08 16:32:32 that can't be right
general 2023-06-08 16:33:17 i thought this was the parody account but nope lmao
general 2023-06-08 16:33:33 best parody account
general 2023-06-08 16:33:37 i mean real account
general 2023-06-08 16:34:29 ssen that isn't about you lol
general 2023-06-08 16:35:06 idk if i should change status
general 2023-06-08 16:35:12 invincibowl is too good
general 2023-06-08 16:35:57 another rare piece
general 2023-06-08 16:36:34 carlos santana and mj really brought the potential of this out ngl
general 2023-06-08 16:38:37 2006 honda civic
general 2023-06-08 16:38:46 ai sponge gets wild
general 2023-06-08 16:46:01 so the pronouns being nitro only screenshot was real lmao
general 2023-06-08 16:48:55 not showing for me
general 2023-06-08 16:49:19 even though the option to add them is there for me
general 2023-06-08 16:50:42 i'm afraid you won't find anything better here
general 2023-06-08 16:51:26 there are only 2 songs on off the wall that i actually really like lmao
general 2023-06-08 16:51:51 rock with you and the title track
general 2023-06-08 16:51:53 that's it
general 2023-06-08 16:53:53 what did fonnex do
general 2023-06-08 16:54:18 when
general 2023-06-08 16:55:29 when this place hotel is better than most of the album
general 2023-06-08 17:33:39 really good ltj bukem tune
general 2023-06-08 18:02:47 it’s still being worked on
general 2023-06-09 02:34:39 he's definitely working on it
general 2023-06-09 02:34:45 that's real evidence
general 2023-06-09 02:35:21 i kind of understand why he doesn't want to talk with the community
general 2023-06-09 02:44:05 yeah he should definitely be talking more but the community isn't exactly the best place
general 2023-06-09 03:34:27 tf?
general 2023-06-09 14:08:47 gets called snowflake = instant block
general 2023-06-09 14:10:19 
general 2023-06-09 14:10:21 because apparently he decides whether people here get rights
general 2023-06-09 14:10:41 idfk it's really stupid
general 2023-06-09 14:11:29 best part of in the closet is the dance
general 2023-06-09 14:16:20 you do know he's just trying to get a reaction out of you
general 2023-06-09 14:16:39 was really obvious too idk how you couldn't see it
general 2023-06-09 14:17:07 no i don't think so
general 2023-06-09 14:17:18 sooty literally believed the denisdaily arrest
general 2023-06-09 14:17:48 denis himself made a video on it
general 2023-06-09 14:17:57 but that's true
general 2023-06-09 14:59:20 this shit still going i just want to listen to the original 2 bad intro
general 2023-06-09 15:04:44 original 2 bad intro is really weird
general 2023-06-09 15:04:58 makes me wonder if this was for the ghosts mix
general 2023-06-09 15:17:53 i love how everyone is taking it at face value and not reverse image searching
general 2023-06-09 15:18:59 i'm tired as shit i slept at 4am yesterday
general 2023-06-09 15:20:15 reading that whole thing was an experience lmao
general 2023-06-09 15:41:38 (impossible)
general 2023-06-10 01:18:48 greatest interaction
general 2023-06-10 01:20:03 lmao which one
general 2023-06-10 01:20:14 why did you download them
general 2023-06-10 01:20:20 lol
general 2023-06-10 01:20:24 just the vocals
general 2023-06-10 01:20:50 privacy isn’t even that good whatever happens is a way better song on invincible
general 2023-06-10 01:21:27 carlos santana and mj 💪
general 2023-06-10 01:22:23 that mix is super outdated too i had to change it 4 times
general 2023-06-10 01:24:35 at least it's not the early stuff for dangerous
general 2023-06-10 01:24:45 those songs are shit
general 2023-06-10 01:25:41 good
general 2023-06-10 01:27:30 only good thing from that period was the demo for dangerous
general 2023-06-10 01:28:38 
general 2023-06-10 01:29:13 i should've just sent a youtube link lol
general 2023-06-10 01:29:45 full thing too
general 2023-06-10 01:29:54 not the cut down version on ultimate collection
general 2023-06-10 01:31:55 what's with the arms lmao
general 2023-06-10 01:32:11 makes sense
general 2023-06-10 11:49:38 ember you're still here?
general 2023-06-10 11:49:39 damn
general 2023-06-10 11:51:29 also known as a game not running on a codebase that dates back to 2014
general 2023-06-10 15:36:04 
general 2023-06-10 16:09:51 it's the official earth song remix on the blood on the dance floor album lmao
general 2023-06-10 16:10:26 mhm
general 2023-06-11 07:27:15 ebay has to chill with suggestions
general 2023-06-11 07:27:30 i do not want to spend 80 bucks on a cd single
general 2023-06-11 07:31:41 it isn't even that good as well, it's just rare
general 2023-06-11 07:32:08 picture disc but it doesn't utilise the disc that well (transparent)
general 2023-06-11 07:32:41 the blood on the dance floor single looks way better tbh
general 2023-06-11 11:50:13 only look at the costs and nothing else
general 2023-06-11 11:50:18 we want profits
general 2023-06-12 15:51:10 https://youtu.be/Q4pq_6Mxew0
general 2023-06-12 15:51:29 4k estate upscale
general 2023-06-12 15:53:21 https://youtu.be/qC_YfrtOXfY (no this is not the timbaland remix on xscape it's the original)
general 2023-06-12 15:53:29 real la reid dangerous era demo
general 2023-06-12 15:54:35 thought it was invincible era when i first heard it ngl since xscape is mostly made up of invincible era stuff
general 2023-06-12 15:55:50 original xscape demo is the real invincible era sound
general 2023-06-12 15:56:00 darkchild produced
general 2023-06-13 12:20:32 i accidentally made an instrumental of an unreleased song snippet when trying to remove a voiceover
general 2023-06-13 12:23:59 
general 2023-06-13 12:24:25 one of the earliest demos for invincible, evolved into another song from a different artist
general 2023-06-13 12:30:26 this shit in mono wtf is up with my export settings
general 2023-06-13 12:30:35 fix
general 2023-06-13 12:31:17 and one that keeps the actual vocals and the intro (not the best part)
general 2023-06-13 12:39:38 every snippet with no voiceover
general 2023-06-13 12:55:07 there's a writer's demo snippet of you rock my world as well
general 2023-06-13 12:55:51 low quality cause i think most of these came from instagram streams
general 2023-06-13 15:06:00 someone's trying to sell a work in progress tape of the invincible album for $200,000 lmao
general 2023-06-13 15:06:27 
general 2023-06-13 15:07:06 there's been a single rip from the tape and it does have some differences with 2000 watts at least
general 2023-06-13 15:07:28 this is definitely not worth that much though lol
general 2023-06-13 15:08:18 that would be terrible
general 2023-06-13 15:08:27 there's an earlier mix of heaven can wait on it
general 2023-06-13 15:09:09 other songs are pretty much the same
general 2023-06-13 15:10:18 and now i'll devalue the tape slightly
general 2023-06-13 15:10:58 too hard
general 2023-06-13 15:11:04 everything is the same
general 2023-06-13 15:12:01 except that there's no mastering
general 2023-06-13 15:12:58 that 2000 watts tape rip sounds a bit different to the released version
general 2023-06-13 15:20:26 this is how a dat tape shouldn't be archived
general 2023-06-13 15:20:47 mp3 only, lots of noise, speed is a bit off
general 2023-06-13 15:21:31 if they're asking $200,000 for that invincible tape this dangerous tape would be worth a lot more
general 2023-06-15 01:18:35 exactly
general 2023-06-15 04:33:15 revolutionary at the time
general 2023-06-15 11:57:36 he wouldn't get it
general 2023-06-15 14:46:37 someone in the mj server made this extended version of the xscape cover with that photoshop ai thing
general 2023-06-15 14:46:40 love it
general 2023-06-15 14:48:19 there's a history one as well
general 2023-06-15 15:20:30 haven't seen you here in a while
general 2023-06-16 05:42:34 need to try to remake the leave me alone bass track
general 2023-06-16 05:42:58 the stream pack groups the drums and bass together
general 2023-06-16 06:33:44 i was lucky to get mine
general 2023-06-16 06:41:57 no way there's higher quality vocals for leave me alone (stream pack ones are shit)
general 2023-06-16 06:42:07 
general 2023-06-16 06:43:07 leave me alone is one of the best songs on bad and i will stand by that
general 2023-06-16 06:43:44 lmao
general 2023-06-16 15:23:26 it happens
general 2023-06-16 15:24:33 ?
general 2023-06-16 15:26:19 it's not a big deal tbh
general 2023-06-16 15:27:09 yeah it's annoying that discord is changing how it works but it's not a big problem for me
general 2023-06-16 15:29:24 how discord is handling the change is probably the worst part
general 2023-06-16 15:30:07 nitro users get priority and are stealing usernames from people like youtubers
general 2023-06-16 15:30:52 fucked up the rollout big time
general 2023-06-16 15:32:15 nitro users didn't even need priority
general 2023-06-16 15:32:23 it's pointless
general 2023-06-16 15:33:23 hi
general 2023-06-16 15:33:29 fair
general 2023-06-16 15:36:26 biggest fumble
general 2023-06-16 15:48:12 writer's demo for privacy sounds weird
general 2023-06-16 15:48:52 (going by 2 snippets)
general 2023-06-16 15:52:49 
general 2023-06-16 16:15:23 seems like it's in a different key as well or i might just be too tired
general 2023-06-17 13:56:06 no
general 2023-06-17 13:56:18 yeah exactly
general 2023-06-18 14:53:49 uh oh
general 2023-06-18 16:09:43 took me long enough to do this
general 2023-06-18 16:09:46 only like 10 months
general 2023-06-18 16:24:01 felt empty without the saw wave bass
general 2023-06-18 16:32:52 literally just some random guy
general 2023-06-18 16:32:58 idk why it's being brought up
general 2023-06-18 16:33:20 and the base theme
general 2023-06-18 16:35:15 i don't even know what's going on
general 2023-06-18 16:35:32 true
general 2023-06-18 16:38:41 i don't see anyone else telling ssen to shut up
general 2023-06-18 16:38:51 or maybe i'm not seeing things
general 2023-06-18 16:39:00 because i'm not here that much
general 2023-06-18 16:41:14 i think it'll be more practical to just not say anything
general 2023-06-18 16:42:01 mhm
general 2023-06-18 16:42:40 needless beef between ssen and hipster for whatever the fuck
general 2023-06-18 16:42:48 i've got no clue on what's going on
general 2023-06-18 16:42:59 i'm tired i said the wrong thing
general 2023-06-18 16:43:04 fixed though
general 2023-06-18 16:47:29 waste of time complaining here
general 2023-06-18 16:47:43 nobody would change no matter what you say
general 2023-06-18 16:48:39 i mean i don’t like this place but i don’t go around shouting about it
general 2023-06-18 16:48:47 it’s pointless
general 2023-06-18 16:49:08 not sayori
general 2023-06-18 16:50:40 sayori only had depression and that’s about it
general 2023-06-18 16:51:33 
general 2023-06-18 16:52:07 aiming high
general 2023-06-18 16:52:39 
general 2023-06-18 16:52:46 i love the invincibowl
general 2023-06-18 16:53:13 
general 2023-06-18 16:53:19 pre order now

general 2023-06-18 16:53:26 johnbranca.net
general 2023-06-18 16:53:56 real product
general 2023-06-18 16:54:18 i bought one
general 2023-06-18 16:54:23 a while back
general 2023-06-18 16:54:37 it’s so real
general 2023-06-18 16:54:48 australia
general 2023-06-18 16:54:58 
general 2023-06-18 16:55:27 (the invincibowl is sadly fake)
general 2023-06-18 16:57:32 smink now (i didn’t make this someone else did)
general 2023-06-18 16:59:11 calculated attack
general 2023-06-18 16:59:58 bad
general 2023-06-18 17:00:32 i forgot that hyperbot is stuck in 2020

general 2023-06-18 17:02:19 i hate the botdf album remixes
general 2023-06-18 17:02:42 except for the scream one and the history one those are good
general 2023-06-18 17:03:16 this is the real meaning
general 2023-06-18 17:07:38 i’d end world hunger because you can easily just leave here
general 2023-06-19 15:34:02 yeah the fun of getting someone's ip
general 2023-06-20 12:52:13 https://tenor.com/view/michael-jackson-inthecloset-music-dance-gif-4685881
general 2023-06-20 12:52:43 love the itc dance
general 2023-06-20 12:53:03 i like the botdf dance break more though
general 2023-06-20 13:06:48 hi hyper
general 2023-06-20 13:20:33 i think there's a balance that has to be achieved to maintain hype and still keep it relatively "mysterious" or whatever you call it
general 2023-06-20 13:22:52 currently this isn't happening since the community has practically given up hope on the game
general 2023-06-20 13:26:32 don't say things like that lol, i don't think i am
general 2023-06-20 13:30:30 definitely understand why rick doesn't want to interact with anyone here though
general 2023-06-20 13:31:15 even if he does dm someone, they'll probably screenshot and post it here
general 2023-06-20 13:31:27 and then a bunch of pings
general 2023-06-20 13:32:26 https://tenor.com/view/michael-branca-album-branca-gif-27133823
general 2023-06-20 13:32:39 oh wait it's the 28th anniversary of history
general 2023-06-20 13:32:50 i just realised
general 2023-06-20 13:33:29 why give gammarad immunity?
general 2023-06-20 13:33:35 don't see a point really
general 2023-06-20 13:34:39 probably one of mj's most inconsistent albums, a bad era track is part of the new material for whatever reason, but there are great songs on there
general 2023-06-20 13:36:55 also because of the 28th anniversary
general 2023-06-20 13:37:22 r. kelly's demo for you are not alone (i do not support him at all)
general 2023-06-20 22:30:06 hi koy
general 2023-06-20 22:30:50 have to go
general 2023-06-21 08:41:56 hi darkz
general 2023-06-21 08:42:41 fair enough
general 2023-06-21 09:24:12 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/696453338555875419/1070644563301117952/IMG_0146.gif
general 2023-06-21 09:27:41 i'm still getting emails from ebay about the stupid on the line cd single
general 2023-06-22 07:39:52 surprised it’s not a first party controller
general 2023-06-22 13:14:04 
general 2023-06-22 15:09:00 he joins back
general 2023-06-22 15:09:23 after he leaves
general 2023-06-22 15:09:27 most of the time at least
general 2023-06-22 15:11:19 also what happened to your pfp?
general 2023-06-23 02:54:43 holy shit real remember the time multitracks exist but there's just this snippet
general 2023-06-23 02:57:49 surprised since the only teddy riley tracks that had multis leaked are jam and ghosts (partial)
general 2023-06-23 02:58:09 botdf doesn't count since that was reworked
general 2023-06-23 06:55:48 still working on pilotwings stuff
general 2023-06-23 06:57:09 the font in that screenshot is old, here's how it usually is
general 2023-06-23 13:25:20 about time i did more than just the chants
general 2023-06-24 08:17:27 yeah tbh that sentence is a bit eh
general 2023-06-24 08:30:21 yeah it’s not exactly a surprise that you got banned from that
general 2023-06-24 10:01:05 
general 2023-06-24 10:01:29 a bit of trolling on google maps
general 2023-06-24 10:01:35 if 4 businesses count as a bit
general 2023-06-24 10:07:19 these are peak
general 2023-06-24 16:58:34 
general 2023-06-25 07:48:18 
general 2023-06-25 07:48:51 this stuff needs to be spread around
general 2023-06-25 07:49:07 don't want any more lost media (a leaked snippet has already been lost)
general 2023-06-25 08:09:44 there's like a soulseek archive with a bunch of stuff but it's incomplete
general 2023-06-25 08:10:13 not even gdrive and all that is safe since the main archive got nuked by someone from the mj online team
general 2023-06-25 08:11:08 3 separate archives all got taken down at once
general 2023-06-25 08:27:33 so funny
general 2023-06-25 08:53:40 https://media.giphy.com/media/kvoeK3sffJ0G0iDsem/giphy.gif
general 2023-06-25 13:56:40 i think he's saying private server
general 2023-06-25 15:29:19 
general 2023-06-25 15:29:23 too much effort on this
general 2023-06-25 15:29:56 you are not alone
general 2023-06-25 15:29:59 michael jackson
general 2023-06-25 15:30:26 love the history album 💪
general 2023-06-25 15:30:48 
general 2023-06-25 15:30:50 incase you wanted it with vocals
general 2023-06-25 15:31:13 there's like 3 bg vocal stems
general 2023-06-25 15:32:47 r. kelly on his way to make 3 similar sounding songs for mj over the span of 8 years:
general 2023-06-25 15:33:02 (i do not support r. kelly)
general 2023-06-25 15:35:45 wait fuck you gotta redownload the instrumental because there was static from the main stems
general 2023-06-25 15:35:50 sending new one
general 2023-06-25 15:36:33 
general 2023-06-25 15:36:35 no static now

general 2023-06-25 15:41:50 lossless hot street
general 2023-06-25 15:41:51 (unreleased)
general 2023-06-25 15:42:41 also a bit of higher quality slapstick
general 2023-06-25 15:55:00 i did not expect that lol
general 2023-06-25 16:03:19 right now it's severely underhyped
general 2023-06-25 16:03:41 there's fuck all being shared
general 2023-06-25 16:08:25 i'd expect that from something that has just entered development, because there's not much to show, but pc2 has been in development (as the rewrite) for 3 fucking years https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/733019549154410506
general 2023-06-25 16:09:23 that link i shared is the first mention of work being done on the full game rewrite
general 2023-06-25 16:13:55 free horrich he was speaking facts
general 2023-06-25 17:26:15 i’ve seen it before lol
general 2023-06-25 17:26:21 it’s so good
general 2023-06-26 02:49:24 racism
general 2023-06-26 02:49:29 idk if there was more to it
general 2023-06-26 02:50:16 kind of had hate messages on his plane and those symbols
general 2023-06-26 03:30:33 
general 2023-06-26 03:30:54 saddest moment
general 2023-06-28 01:59:33 no they don't
general 2023-06-28 02:05:10 they don't exist
general 2023-06-28 02:05:22 mee6 is a server bot as well
general 2023-06-28 02:05:27 (no dm access)
general 2023-06-28 02:05:42 fabricated bullshit lmao
general 2023-06-28 02:07:05 discord usernames are like that now
general 2023-06-28 02:07:20 it doesn't have your tag still sorry
general 2023-06-28 02:08:50 also why is the date crossed out
general 2023-06-28 02:09:01 instant discredit
general 2023-06-28 02:15:53 i love how the story changes
general 2023-06-28 02:16:04 first it's dm logs and now it's something else
general 2023-06-28 02:18:17 it does too
general 2023-06-28 02:18:31 literally only closes for the person who closed it
general 2023-06-28 02:18:35 other person can still see dms
general 2023-06-28 02:19:11 i don't even see a point
general 2023-06-28 02:21:24 yeah maybe it'll be more believable if the date is unblurred
general 2023-06-29 05:18:34 alright
general 2023-06-29 05:18:43 never seen an arcade with that
general 2023-06-29 05:19:40 i like the actual games at arcades
general 2023-06-29 05:19:46 not that ticket bullshit
general 2023-06-29 05:19:56 ?
general 2023-06-29 05:20:14 stuff like daytona and afterburner
general 2023-06-29 05:21:13 when 3d games were powered by adapted military technology
general 2023-06-29 05:25:34 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/497142796961054721/886271837816901642/image0.gif
general 2023-06-29 05:25:36 r360 is the real shit
general 2023-06-29 05:27:57 after burner climax in an r360 unit would be mad
general 2023-06-29 05:28:21 sadly only released with g-loc or wingwar
general 2023-06-29 05:29:31 special restricted versions too
general 2023-06-29 11:35:09 the fastest transfer speed
general 2023-06-29 12:32:47 i've got a bunch of rare official leave me alone remixes
general 2023-06-29 14:33:19 finally bothered to update some outdated plugins
general 2023-06-29 14:33:50 got a new rich presence plugin for foobar with album art support
general 2023-06-29 14:34:52 pain in the ass to set it up
general 2023-06-29 14:36:04 amazing idea
general 2023-06-29 14:39:28 (can't update some of them so i had to download the 32bit version of the new foobar update)
general 2023-06-29 15:27:01 the best official version
general 2023-06-29 15:27:31 shame it went unreleased
general 2023-06-30 02:31:46 it's going to flop
general 2023-06-30 03:06:31 we have actual footage of gta6 in development
general 2023-06-30 03:06:40 more than what we have with pc2 lmao
general 2023-06-30 03:07:03 it's actually a decent game
general 2023-06-30 03:07:14 but it looks wild now
general 2023-06-30 03:07:23 i haven't played in a long while
general 2023-06-30 03:07:33 what console?
general 2023-06-30 03:07:57 understandable
general 2023-06-30 03:08:26 i mean the game was like this back then too, but less complicated
general 2023-06-30 03:08:39 if anything it's gotten easier
general 2023-06-30 03:09:54 totk is amazing
general 2023-06-30 03:10:07 yeah
general 2023-06-30 03:10:13 but i also bought it
general 2023-06-30 03:10:23 yeah
general 2023-06-30 03:10:27 1st gen
general 2023-06-30 03:11:27 i pirated it when it leaked and tried to play the opening sequence but the performance was terrible
general 2023-06-30 03:11:50 not my computer because i've got ps3 games emulated and another switch title
general 2023-06-30 03:11:56 just a totk thing
general 2023-06-30 03:15:47 because they made the game with anti piracy measures
general 2023-06-30 03:18:00 finally got one
general 2023-06-30 03:18:06 only jacksons song i like
general 2023-06-30 10:24:20 the remake
general 2023-07-01 03:21:36 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1124539721608085594/comparison.gif
general 2023-07-01 03:21:39 successful remake
general 2023-07-01 03:21:55 making a replica of this
general 2023-07-01 05:37:08 good enough
general 2023-07-01 11:09:12 "how to fix keyboard" in tabs
general 2023-07-01 11:09:15 peak google skills
general 2023-07-01 12:26:10 it really is
general 2023-07-01 16:21:22 
general 2023-07-01 16:24:26 such a real ip grabber
general 2023-07-01 16:24:37 of course audacity makes ip grabbers
general 2023-07-01 16:27:10 10 months since last piece of concrete evidence
general 2023-07-01 17:01:31 the video
general 2023-07-02 01:05:18 audacity with the WASAPI option:
general 2023-07-02 01:07:41 this is what you need
general 2023-07-02 01:08:39 gamebar method is too complicated and time comsuming (aac audio only btw)
general 2023-07-02 01:09:43 like this isn't great
general 2023-07-02 01:10:27 already a lossy source, then converting to another lossy source from it
general 2023-07-02 01:51:55 leaked fanmade mix of blood on the dance floor from the history world tour lol
general 2023-07-02 02:57:36 maybe there should be more visual evidence shared, because some people still think it's cancelled from disinfo despite your attempts to say that you're still working on it
general 2023-07-02 02:58:06 yes i know, but that took 10 months
general 2023-07-02 02:58:18 this right here
general 2023-07-02 02:58:55 there is clearly not enough being put out at the moment to sustain hype
general 2023-07-02 03:00:06 i don't think a screenshot of a new part is worth 10 months of nothing but "i'm working on it"
general 2023-07-02 03:00:26 it's severely underhyped atm
general 2023-07-02 03:01:01 people think it's cancelled or just a plain lie
general 2023-07-02 03:01:58 also when the driller 40 boxset is going to come out
general 2023-07-02 03:02:06 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1122185674670493696/cooltext438222595094973.gif
general 2023-07-02 03:02:24 driller/griller/thriller
general 2023-07-02 03:02:26 same thing
general 2023-07-02 03:07:16 there's only a couple songs from the police that i actually like
general 2023-07-02 04:13:34 facts
general 2023-07-02 04:16:19 i love soulseek
general 2023-07-02 04:16:42 have to wait for 6102 downloads to finish
general 2023-07-02 04:16:43 so good
general 2023-07-02 04:25:48 best result so far
general 2023-07-02 04:25:58 still not great
general 2023-07-02 09:56:17 no he left
general 2023-07-02 09:56:35 nah
general 2023-07-02 11:26:21 you can't even buy it lmao
general 2023-07-02 11:26:27 limited for whatever reason
general 2023-07-02 11:31:37 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/841439608373379082/1125025576705609738/hood_mj.gif
general 2023-07-03 10:03:19 do you sit there and do nothing except eat food
general 2023-07-03 10:03:25 like the actual show
general 2023-07-03 11:41:48 not sure if this is fake or not since the weirdest shit leaks sometimes
general 2023-07-03 11:43:28 have you seen the roblox leaks lmao
general 2023-07-03 11:43:47 the mod manual is one of the documents ever
general 2023-07-03 11:45:20 from the officially released stems
general 2023-07-03 11:45:28 not the album mix
general 2023-07-03 11:46:35 i love how personal information is also included
general 2023-07-03 11:46:52 for whatever reason
general 2023-07-03 11:48:43 the person who stole brad sundberg's laptop from his michael jackson seminar is planning a round 2
general 2023-07-03 14:35:52 
general 2023-07-03 14:36:11 need more invincible demos

general 2023-07-04 03:38:59 more rarities
general 2023-07-04 03:39:22 i'm missing the last 2 unreleased remixes in good quality
general 2023-07-04 03:40:14 still looking for those
general 2023-07-04 03:40:20 as well as all the this time around remixes
general 2023-07-04 03:40:28 from the promo releases
general 2023-07-04 16:50:12 i remember synth

general 2023-07-05 13:58:01 hi jusuj
general 2023-07-05 14:16:54 there are servers that are much worse than this place, but there are also a lot of servers that are way better
general 2023-07-05 14:17:37 literally the worst it's been in here
general 2023-07-05 14:21:28 so true
general 2023-07-05 16:20:11 it's actually worse here now, and even though i don't break rules i find minimods just straight up annoying
general 2023-07-05 16:26:03 the stuff about people with no ranks being attacked for no reason is also true, most of that is pointless and unwarranted
general 2023-07-05 16:30:17 he's talking about the 1,143 other pings listed there

general 2023-07-05 16:50:06 the ai song guys already got a friendly notice from sony music
general 2023-07-05 16:50:23 matches perfectly with what he does
general 2023-07-05 16:51:12 and this is why you carefully consider every decision you make
general 2023-07-05 16:51:30 otherwise something like this will go down lmao

general 2023-07-07 11:34:48 alright here's a suggestion
general 2023-07-07 11:34:52 maybe don't break the rules
general 2023-07-07 11:34:59 then you won't get banned
general 2023-07-07 11:35:40 and this too
general 2023-07-07 11:36:03 no wonder
general 2023-07-07 11:36:52 would not warrant a perma in my books
general 2023-07-07 11:37:03 i'd ban for a week
general 2023-07-07 11:37:16 do it again and it'll be perma
general 2023-07-07 11:37:33 this is my opinion
general 2023-07-07 11:37:34 not fact
general 2023-07-07 11:37:47 i am not a server mod so idk
general 2023-07-07 11:38:10 wouldn't unban if this is the attitude i get lmao

general 2023-07-07 11:39:18 want to hear from the source

general 2023-07-15 13:12:06 
general 2023-07-15 13:27:32 i need to somehow acquire the breaking news instrumental in high quality
general 2023-07-15 13:28:25 to filter out the vocals and then split bgv from lead
general 2023-07-15 15:08:24 2004 was last year
general 2023-07-15 15:11:46 current year is 2005
general 2023-07-15 15:11:54 so 2004 was last year
general 2023-07-15 15:15:07 managed to get the raw lead vocals for breaking news
general 2023-07-15 15:15:14 sounds nothing like mj lmao
general 2023-07-15 15:31:45 like this is far from mj
general 2023-07-15 15:31:53 this is the real deal, not filtered out
general 2023-07-16 02:30:23 also known as pi
general 2023-07-16 08:05:06 no more tsunami
general 2023-07-16 08:08:07 no he’s literally gone
general 2023-07-16 08:08:52 assume this was planned out
general 2023-07-16 13:04:43 fair enough
general 2023-07-16 13:05:30 2020 iirc
general 2023-07-16 13:05:55 he did do stuff initially
general 2023-07-16 16:17:49 he's so great

general 2023-07-16 16:28:29 nick eh 30 truly is a character
general 2023-07-18 09:51:40 this is what you get on marketplace
general 2023-07-19 04:09:48 have you heard of the scroll wheel
general 2023-07-19 04:10:50 what's this thing on the side that you can drag
general 2023-07-19 04:12:56 we said the scroll bar exists
general 2023-07-19 04:15:44 how do you zoom out in roblox if your scroll wheel is broken
general 2023-07-19 04:16:17 oh yeah i forgot you can manually zoom with 2 buttons but i forgot what they are
general 2023-07-19 04:18:04 if it's too hard to find the scroll bar page up and page down exists
general 2023-07-19 05:24:55 it is what it is
general 2023-07-19 05:26:09 so true
general 2023-07-19 05:30:06 the chips game
general 2023-07-19 05:30:30 this was mildly funny ages ago
general 2023-07-19 05:30:34 just mildly
general 2023-07-19 08:40:02 hi septagin
general 2023-07-19 08:42:18 yeah just don't do shit
general 2023-07-19 08:43:47 thought you left ages ago
general 2023-07-19 08:44:16 yeah fair enough this place is shit
general 2023-07-19 10:13:35 this is another issue that can be solved by reading
general 2023-07-19 10:39:01 rickje definitely announced pc2 way too early
general 2023-07-19 10:40:49 i believe he probably had to restart along the way
general 2023-07-19 10:40:59 and the overall scope got larger
general 2023-07-19 10:41:09 (was meant to be a rewrite of pc1)
general 2023-07-19 10:42:00 i'm only saying that because he was having talks about the rewrite all the way back in 2020
general 2023-07-19 10:43:10 not like restart the whole project, but certain aspects of it
general 2023-07-19 10:43:55 pc2 is the rewrite
general 2023-07-19 10:43:59 but with more stuff
general 2023-07-19 10:48:47 idk much about this stuff but i think hardcoded sort of relates to how stuff is "set in stone" in the code
general 2023-07-19 10:49:27 only example that comes to mind for me rn is with the original starfox titles
general 2023-07-19 10:50:09 had to do palette cycling for the original starfox so we used a really hacky solution to directly write the snes colour values in the code
general 2023-07-19 10:50:27 no it's all good
general 2023-07-19 10:50:36 don't need to play them for this
general 2023-07-19 10:51:54 starfox 2 grabs the colour values from the palette files, only the colour file used and the hi/lo flag has to be specified in the level setup
general 2023-07-19 10:53:15 yeah exactly
general 2023-07-19 10:53:36 bunch of lines that needed to be changed manually in code if there was any change to the colours
general 2023-07-19 10:54:02 level backgrounds
general 2023-07-19 10:55:16 also just added more time to the whole process because i needed to paste each line in the dev channel for it to be put in game
general 2023-07-19 10:56:29 some ported from starfox 2, some that were from the nintendo leak, and some from the starfox alpha
general 2023-07-19 10:56:38 with alterations when needed
general 2023-07-19 11:01:37 pasting lines of hex in the dev channel
general 2023-07-19 11:01:50 such an enjoyable experience
general 2023-07-19 12:36:09 maybe in <#498473314445033472>
