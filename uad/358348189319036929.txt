plane-crazy 2022-10-23 20:55:58 i haven't been here in a long time, do we know when pc2 is planned to release yet?
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 20:56:23 ok, i was wondering since last i heard it was supposed to be summer 2022
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:00 how do i paint the top of a conveyor belt without using the paint all thing?
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:17:22 ive done it before just idk how
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 05:18:08 wait if i clip my camera into the front part i can paint it
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 17:02:11 anybody else not able to enter pvp mode?
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 17:02:29 keeps saying "Attempted to teleport to a place that is restricted"
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 17:03:07 nvm after a couple more tries it worked
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 08:58:38 anyone got a list of the "heavy" blocks? iirc correctly making them ice material actually makes them heavier instead of lighter
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 23:06:35 what's the best counter agaisnt a swarm of shredders?
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 23:07:13 i mean to kill them, i can easily avoid them
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 23:07:24 im not going to stoop down to their level
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 23:07:50 ight
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 05:22:43 does anyone have the direct link to the plane crazy arena place?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 05:31:20 can i has?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 05:48:46 you're*
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 23:13:15 how many roblox studs wide is one block?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 05:20:00 how would I stabilize a large build mid air? i tried helium but it wobbles back and forth slowly instead of staying upright
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 05:23:24 nvm figured it out (wing panels)
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 21:22:14 is the ability to scale blocks going to be in pc2?
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 21:22:46 wdym? they literally said they are working on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 21:23:32 has it been cancelled?
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:27:12 bro why do cutters work in private servers with pvp off?
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:54:13 how would i make a stabilizer that makes a build stay upright?
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:54:49 ive seen it done
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 02:55:09 i think it needs either hover engines or conveyers but idk how to make it
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:31:21 anyone know how?
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:32:11 upwards relative to the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:33:08 it would be useful
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:33:25 ballast at the bottom of a build and helium at the top kinda works but is unstable and wobbly
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:34:09 a big heli-carrier type thing, might also use it for other things
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 03:35:38 that wouldn't do anything other than make it upside down
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:15:43 so apparently the speed (assuming it does mean studs per second) is almost the exact same as kilometers per hour since 100 studs per second is 100.8 kilometers per hour
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:28 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:37 according to official roblox conversion
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:28:54 which sides of a trapdoor weld?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:29:21 ah the sides do, thanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:35:49 my plane has started just going up and down randomly, it wasn't doing this before today and reloading it doesn't fix it
edit: nvm i just scrolled up
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 01:41:01 bold of you to assume the devs care about the game anymore <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 01:45:40 has the motor2 wing bug been fixed yet?
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:17:06 when i use motor2s set to servo for wheel turning they wobble like crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 02:20:43 any way to fix it?
