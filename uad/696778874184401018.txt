help 2022-09-16 22:31:55 how would i make a ship fold horizontal and have a seamless fit? the only way ive done this ends up leaving a small gap where the folding bar travels. i want it to try and be a pvp ship which would mean that gap needs to go.
help 2022-09-17 20:22:27 does water jets destroy launched rockets? and can i use them as anti missle for ships?
help 2022-09-17 20:24:16 i sadly dont got anyone to test with then... ill just try another way maybe
help 2022-09-17 20:26:59 also does motor locking a bunch of blocks together ( like a ship deck ) make it more bullet/rocket proof?
help 2022-09-19 20:25:00 how would i do a seamless fold where the two pieces shown here connect at the red pieces?
help 2022-09-19 20:25:31 i cant seem to find a way that doesnt make a hole on the side where the fold arm has to travel through

help 2022-09-21 22:03:18 Is there a way to make semi accurate air to air missiles because the normal rockets barely work at high speeds
help 2022-09-21 22:04:14 As long as it‚Äôs semi accurate I can figure out how to fit it on a plane

help 2022-09-21 22:09:38 K Thanks, I‚Äôll be able to use it as a reference point to see if I can make one that fits what I want to do
help 2022-09-21 22:11:13 Is there such thing as wings breaking if you go to fast in this game or is it just not a mechanic
help 2022-09-21 22:12:37 Also can you break a plane by just a high velocity projectile ( not explosive ) just hitting the plane or will it just bounce off?
help 2022-09-25 19:40:30 does text blocks mess with rocket locking?
