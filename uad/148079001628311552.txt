plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:03:23 i use camera forcefield
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:04:17 in a sphere around your craft connected to the build to create an invisible forcefield
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:04:27 really confuses people
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:04:51 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:06:21 ByPassing is bad

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:06:41 they be dumb
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:06 counter rotation
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:09 i think
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:15 oh motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:18 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:30 nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:37 i could spend that time refining
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:44 and make an entire floating city
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:08:11 why is motors in every game always broken
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:08:35 plane crazy space engineers and i can keep on listing more
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:08:43 all the motors are broekn
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:09:15 i need to make MEGA see saw
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:09:32 ehh
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:09:44 i have had worse experiences with motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:10:02 ehh
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:10:41 thanks for remind me of my thing im working on
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:10:59 redstone engineers are cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:11:22 my iq is below applesauce
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:49:29 im going to make a cannon with a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:49:49 not a plane with a cannon
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 17:49:59 but a cannon with a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:59:52 creating a heli that is stable with a functioning swish plate is pain
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:50:39 how do people make combat planes i can only make 4000 block behemoths
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:18:13 i build only fictional things cause when i try to recreate somthing it looks trash
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:18:46 symmetry is cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:19:56 i like building things that fly but that are not really planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:20:21 upboops
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:21:10 when are detached from motor 2s they break and decid moving is bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:21:21 use motor 1s
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:21:44 i found a by pass
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:21:54 attach a motor to a motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:22:02 then it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:23:48 i finally made a working swish plates with just pistons and unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:24:19 good plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:24:24 its pretty awesoem
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:24:39 cantent
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:25:17 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:27:01 wow thats plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 22:11:51 w
creations-chat 2020-07-29 00:48:15 cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:01:50 wait somone scamming poor kiddos on plane crazy howth dare they
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:02:03 a bot
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:02:06 does that
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:02:29 thats the classic bot you cant ban them
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:02:35 they will just come back
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:02:44 its actually pain
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:03:33 the issue with roblox being f2p is the endless bots
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 17:03:51 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 18:33:10 Probably a ship that has not been invented yet
general 2020-10-20 18:02:17 the roblox data stores have been disconnected
general 2020-10-20 18:02:28 legit seperated its not adopt me
general 2020-10-20 18:02:56 like dissconected completely the data stores have had their plug pulled for some reason
general 2020-10-20 18:03:18 its not that your data is wiped its that it is not connected to the game
general 2020-10-20 18:03:52 YOUR DATA IS NOT WIPED IT IS NOT WIPED It IS JUST DISSCONECTED THIS IS AFFECTING ALL GAMES
creations-chat 2020-11-26 17:38:48 what have i created
creations-chat 2020-11-26 17:40:42 keep in mind that mechanism is made completely of motors no hover engine stuff here
bot-central 2020-12-20 05:01:21 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 05:07:03 make that a hover engine so it actually produces power
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 05:07:16 instead of just using suspention
creations-chat 2020-12-27 01:16:05 yeah lol
creations-chat 2020-12-27 01:18:06 it was just a concept to tryout the extendable thrust bays
creations-chat 2021-03-03 06:49:05 imagine using motor lock
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:18:40 looks nice although i wish we had better tools to use in this game for more fine details and making this easier to build
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:20:41 a scale and rotation tool would be amazing
i have seen some of the insane builds from build a boat for treasure and if we could get that level of scale and detail in this game it would be a life changer
creations-chat 2021-03-07 07:30:33 dont hate on asymmetrical builds
general 2021-03-08 19:02:46 thats one small cage
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:30:52 omg did he say cuss word
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:31:44 oh no you cussed again your going to jail to eat brocli
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:32:20 damn my 5 year old kid logic failed me
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:32:46 amogus

the-dump 2021-03-09 15:35:49 the imposter is sus
the-dump 2021-03-09 15:36:16 amogus
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:41:54 why do people use control surfaces when you can use gyroscopes
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:43:56 you can create gyroscopes by rotating weight at high speeds i use it for my bigger builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:45:48 like the heli carriers camo in avengers
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:48:21 I dont know much about fighter jets in planecrazy as im a mega builder but I think there are easier methods to get good maneuverability when flying than just spamming control surfaces because having too many control surfaces would actually cause a lot of drag
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:49:42 uhh i think you can rotate the motor 2 with another motor and get the desired effect
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:53:37 what about using gimble thrusters
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:56:21 you can cram a gimble system with motor lock
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:58:35 Laughs in a literal mobile oil rig with full AA
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:07:06 try hitting a moving target
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:14:53 that would be too close as a single flak would detonate those bombs before they even got close
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:37:42 i think most people have an irrational fear of WIP builds
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:40:06 i could post my 90% completed megabuild and people would still downvote it but in reality you should not care about what others think
general 2021-04-22 14:44:11 random access memory
general 2021-04-22 14:45:03 its like a very fast SSD that is used to keep data on active applications using an HDD would make things painfully slow
creations-chat 2021-06-06 19:08:41 this was just a concept to figure out if i could make a build that only uses hover thrust and it works should i do anything else with it?
creations-chat 2021-07-09 02:58:11 ok im building a chess bot anyone have any good idea for chess pieces
creations-chat 2021-07-09 03:18:00 I wonder what this gear could be used for it meshes pretty well
creations-chat 2021-07-09 03:20:02 yeah that could work differing gear ratios could be used interestingly although the roblox engine does not always agree with stuff like that
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:15:07 i dont use motor lock loal
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:17:51 oh that boat is dog crap (mine)
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:20:34 loal yeah it was awful i only made that boat to test out a certain feature and the funny thing is it does actually have some motor lock in it
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:22:39 i also made whatever the hell this is
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:27:04 i noticed that as well
the thing is if i want to make something that looks good ill just build it in build a boat for treasure i just like this game for more things you can do mechanics wise
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:36:13 you dont run it off of motor power you basically unpower the motor and use thrusters instead
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:36:43 yeah i tried doing real props and its hell
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 04:37:11 it took me a day to get something that could kinda hover
creations-chat 2021-07-09 04:43:45 D1? oh yeah i guess it does
creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:13:34 ok so i am building a gear based artillery thing but the motor keeps slipping not the gears but the motor even with max torque any ideas on how to stop that. current idea is a suspension arm limiter but im worried that would limit the pitch range of the gun.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 03:25:26 aeiou still no ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:13:43 probably not the rickroll
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:13:50 🙂
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:14:39 is the new update pretty *fly*

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:31:23 bro are you filming your screen with another camera
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:31:52 just use OBS or even the roblox recorder
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:32:17 well the roblox recorder then
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:32:21 it should be fine
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:52:29 will we get bigger buildspace
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:53:08 imagine if i could build mega projects without needing to fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:54:44 deese nuts
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:55:10 PC2 looks pretty fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:55:29 and yes i am winging it with these puns
general 2021-08-20 03:17:44 i just saw the new development picture i dont think that quality will cut it though
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:22:19 hot take: motor lock is over rated
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:24:22 time to join the military so i can use military time
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:26:24 the motorlock being overrated was a joke designed to anger the people in this chat and yes i do know how to use mortarlak but i primarily make megabuilds so its not used as much in my creations
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:28:52 sounds crazy but im going to go finish my hover traiin
