bug-reports 2021-06-25 14:47:52 You should try to fix the glitch in pvp where , for example, you destroy someone (a bit of them) , then a piece of the creation or the entire thing freezes somewhere where it was before , and you cant see the person
bug-reports 2021-06-25 14:48:13 Its quite annoying to deal with
