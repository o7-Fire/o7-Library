general 2023-05-06 01:14:40 +10 years in prison
general 2023-05-06 01:16:01 So....do I use the victim as a deterrent?
general 2023-05-06 01:17:04 You have to put it together, so that it gives its testimony
general 2023-05-06 01:18:03 XD
general 2023-05-06 01:18:34 I see that it rises

general 2023-05-06 01:23:58 The family of the victim will make a counterclaim
general 2023-05-06 01:25:08 A family, ask no more
general 2023-05-06 01:25:35 For now, I'm having a cup of coffee
general 2023-05-06 01:27:53 nothing bad happened

creations-chat 2023-05-11 18:18:39 I accidentally sent it to Ukraine :c
creations-chat 2023-05-11 21:22:41 use combination of super rocket motors and hover, stability is 8/10, can't make sharp turns
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:07:52 <@702907851001167882>   they are not always painted
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:10:12 ok I understand, if the T-80 needs a few tweaks, I have planned to put a camouflage on it<:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:12:13 Thank you very much, I will take it into account!
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:55:23 que intentas hacer?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:58:11 what are you trying to do?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:03:33 ok then nothing right? It's not like someone arrives and specifically pinches me, puts big-mouthed faces and for a change, be your Claudio.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:05:40 by the way, your vote is insignificant before the up
creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:27:10 yo no empeze <@767266500997283851>

creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:39:23 tÃ­pico de cobardes <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2023-05-24 08:22:38 I graduated as a Soviet designer, well, nice and cheap xd
creations-chat 2023-05-24 08:25:43 nothing to do xd, it's difficult to do a caterpillar type, I opted for the classic ones, since they are easy to do and the truth is that they don't look so bad.
creations-chat 2023-05-24 17:53:19 That B3 model has not implemented the torque detail, although I have another model that is the T-80, this one does have torque, and everything that has to do with the suspension is a headache, believe me I almost gave up doing the suspension of the T-62, and because of the type of scale, it is very, very difficult to track it
creations-chat 2023-05-24 17:55:24 If the piece that you tell me about here is called a torque roller, which is the one that is connected to the gearbox
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:00:06 No, did the smoke grenade launchers face forward?
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:04:50 (T-90) The smoke grenades face the front, and you could even angle them to make them more noticeable
creations-chat 2023-05-24 18:06:54 The T-80 launches the same Smoke grenades and the same angle  y en todos los modelos rusos el lanza granadas miran al frente<:thoink:657279634563399720>
