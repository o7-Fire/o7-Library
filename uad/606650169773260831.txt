creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:25:30 By motor-locking the gears and the cockpit makes it easy, also bush plane's gears are very easy because they aren't retractable, the only thing you have to do is motor-locking
creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:27:37 Obv. depends on what type of bush plane you wanna make
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 16:32:41 Or by building something big as the Empire state building that moves
creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:35:18 Idk, try to make them somehow, I can't really tell you how to make those gears
creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:37:20 Make the main body first then motor-lock gears and the cockpit to the main body (don't forget about wings) also did you mean how to make the tires? or the whole gear landing?
creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:40:18 Ok so I suggest you to use trails/half wedge in the Half blocks section (Depends on how big you are gonna make it) Then rotate them with a motor to make it attach to the tire, obv the motorlock complex should have TNT blocks/disc. to give you space to rotate the Trail as I said earlier
creations-chat 2021-04-02 16:43:05 Same thing apply on the wings
help 2021-04-02 16:44:45 You need to be rank 3+

creations-chat 2021-04-02 17:13:55 Can't really do that much with the turret
help 2021-04-03 18:10:27 Instead of using TNT, you use springs
