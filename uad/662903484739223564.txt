plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:15:36 Do any of you guys know how to build a swash plate?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:16:41 bruh Ive been tryna build a swash plate for like 4 weeks and I have to biggest headache right now from tryna build one
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:16:49 I hate life sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:17:18 already have
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:18:13 A swash plate is a Helicopter rotor system which allows the blades to flex and turn in any direction to allow for the movement of the helicopter, such as moving forward, strafing left and right, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:19:13 Yeah,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:19:42 I mean normal heli blades are easy, servo motor 2 with wing panels and super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:20:00 but then making one go in any direction,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:20:07 hard as hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:21:10 Since if I put a motor there to make it go up and make it be able to turn, when I start the rotor up, the blades start wobbling and become unstable cause there aint enough strenght there from the motor to keep it from flipping out
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:22:19 all the working swash plates on yt are the size of those Giant german tanks thet people build
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:22:38 Ive seen some people be able to build compact and small ones though,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:22:57 which im tryna do
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:23:38 bruh go on yt and search "plane crazy swash plate tutorial" and you will see what I mean

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:25:47 The dude litterally built the whole heli outta 0.15 ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:25:56 its light as hell,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:26:08 only the weight of like 10 real blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:26:35 if you put that on anything above 25 blocks, the thing starts to have a siezure and die
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:27:18 bruh sometimes I hate life
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:27:56 I spent the whole day, 9am to 10pm building a commercial jet and found out It dont fly

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:07 they try to build a monster of a plane,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:10 just spammed blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:18 and when it dont fly they rage quit
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:31 only teens are smart enough to build something that works
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:47 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:57:09 what should I build
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:57:12 im outta ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:57:58 I like these types of build your own stuff games
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:04 but plane crazy is my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:11 cause its the most realistic and advanced
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:47 Im a smart dude, I make random stuff in real life like cardboard shields and scrap metal helmets
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:54 thats why I like games like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:14 I know but,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:22 Im the typa kid
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:26 who just makes random stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:37 like the most random stuff outta the most random materials
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:51 Bro,
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:00:32 if they add premade models that noobs can get for free, the pcc community would be full of kids again
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:00:58 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:01:07 last year they did that for like a few days
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:01:11 and changed it back
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:01:16 I got the gold
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:01:25 And that vault dosent bug me anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:01:29 cause I know whats inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:02:47 bruh this dude in my server is spamming his "builds" which is litterally spammed ball blocks with engines randomly placed everywhere and when I said stop making a lag machine he just said "its for effect"
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:03:15 I cant
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:03:20 it lags the game like hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:03:46 the dude must have one of those Super duper op computers like the Alien software company ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:03:57 cause the dudes just spam launching his build
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:04 Like he aint lagging 1 bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:34 do any of you guys know how to build a swash plate?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:11 Ive been doing that for 4 weeks 5 days a week
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:25 Ive done that to every single one of those tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:47 Well I spent my entire day today, 9am to 10pm building a air bus and It dont fly

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 00:45:01 Im proud of myself
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 00:48:16 my head ache from tryna build a swash plate for 4 weeks is gone
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 00:49:12 bruh yesterday I spent my whole day building a airbus a-319 and It dosent even fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 00:49:58 das really sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 01:04:19 ultra light air craft
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 01:13:26 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 01:13:40 make a cessna
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 01:30:39 yeah this server is toxic as hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:09:57 nose looks a bit wonky...
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 23:42:35 I just realized how interesting building subs and boats are
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:12:53 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:00:17 I bet it handles like crap
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:00:52 you cant have a plane that flies well when it goes 600sps and has short wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:01:13 I know
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:02:31 it will just wobble like hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:03:04 It aint even flying at that point, your just launching a bunch of blocks into the sky
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:03:47 mans got 4 of em
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:04:36 I hate the noobs that just take the starter plane, paint it all blue and put a rocket on the back, and they call it better than a jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:05:01 in that pic, i dont see any wings bruh
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:05:35 of course that flies well, its a good jet, made for menuverability
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:05:52 but that dude, he just put a bunch of rockets on the starter plane and called it good
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:22 yes,
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:06:39 its a game where aerodynamics are the main subject
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:07:06 Thats real in the game,
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:07:21 Everything that happens in real life, happens in pc
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:08:01 Like, its so scripted that a heli with no rear rotor will turn slighty in a direction oposite of the main rotor,
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:08:14 so if it does that, you can tell its realistic as hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:43:12 are you sure bout that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 05:45:00 amorgus

help 2021-08-29 08:11:39 Add helium blocks then set it to "Apply to Center".
help 2021-08-29 08:12:24 You can edit the helium blocks and theres a option that applies it to the center
help 2021-08-29 08:12:46 I see a white block on the right top
help 2021-08-29 08:13:03 Put it anywre you want,
help 2021-08-29 08:13:43 That "apply to center" Option will make it so that the helium block is affecting the whole plane and not just 1 spot
help 2021-08-29 08:14:14 The nose goes down?
help 2021-08-29 08:21:47 Either,
help 2021-08-29 08:22:08 You add helium blocks in the front,

creations-chat 2021-11-03 05:12:17 <@!325884967986921472>, The nose and the tail are really wonky looking, try adding some stabilizers and, maybe, get a more advanced rotor system on it for better performance.

creations-chat 2021-11-03 06:27:58 nah nah nah, the windscreen needs no work, its just the nose
creations-chat 2021-11-03 06:30:45 <@!325884967986921472> basically, you needa do it like on a normal heli, make a adjustable rotor system on the rear rotor and the main rotor, and do some maths to see what the rear rotor needs to be adjusted to in order for it to overpower the main rotor force, like in a normal heli does.
creations-chat 2021-11-03 06:32:52 make 2 pictures with each wing but on both sides.
help 2021-11-03 06:52:25 use something else for the rotor power

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 03:31:57 if like I take off it will just make the wings have a siezur

help 2022-04-21 15:57:08 I need a way for the wings to be strong enough to not just collapse on the weight of the plane but also to tilt to say like 15 degrees or 10 degrees.
help 2022-04-21 15:58:16 How do I lock folded wings...
help 2022-04-21 15:58:45 Wait, lemme do a sample real quick.

help 2022-04-23 15:45:04 Appreciate it.
help 2022-04-23 15:46:18 I'm a actual dumbass for relying on images not blueprints, they're so much more accurate and clear...
help 2022-04-23 15:46:34 Thanks man, It helps alot.
help 2022-04-23 15:48:50 To be honest, I have no goddamn idea how to make noses, so I usually take em from a tutorial, then I make the body all by myself, and thats where I screw it up so I gotta find alotta time fixing it up but at the end It usually turns out good.
help 2022-04-23 15:52:08 My weakness is the shape of most noses and how they're shaped, they're all curved in wierd ways with them being either wider on the side or wider on the top, and The only nose I know how to make is the noobiest one where its just the triangle wedges stacked onto eachother, Anyways, thanks buddy, appreciate the help, we should stop talking here.
help 2022-04-23 15:54:32 Pretty sure he's talking about me...
help 2022-04-23 15:59:23 All I could find were like angles at the side, I was dumb enough to not find any blueprints, I could've get a clear shot from the top.
help 2022-04-23 15:59:33 Thats probably why it looked like crap.
help 2022-09-23 08:54:32 Lock the Motor, Locking the Motor means the motor will stay in that position and its welded still, The reason why your wings are wobbling is because the Motors on the wings are struggling to keep up with the weight of the plane fuselage.
