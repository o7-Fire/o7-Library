help 2023-02-10 00:42:10 explode on impact is not accurate! if a explosive tnt hits something, the explosion lags back, instead of it exploding near where it is on my screen. Is there any way to fix this other than pressing a key to make it explode?

plane-crazy 2023-04-01 03:25:13 plane crazy gonna add radar?
plane-crazy 2023-04-01 03:25:22 motor2s can track with radar would be insane
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 01:07:25 Radar gonna be added to plane crazy????
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 01:07:49 Like kerbal space program
general 2023-04-02 01:09:47 Radar should be added to plane crazy 2!
general 2023-04-02 01:13:46 Why
general 2023-04-02 01:14:03 ?
general 2023-04-02 01:14:26 For like missiles and stuff
general 2023-04-02 01:14:50 Like if you lock on someone, motor2s will follow them
general 2023-04-02 01:15:05 rockets will go behind the plane tho
general 2023-04-02 01:15:48 It would be a fun game edition
general 2023-04-02 01:16:00 PvP now is boring
general 2023-04-02 01:16:17 How so?
general 2023-04-02 01:16:53 It adds a new feature that is unique and cool to mess around with
general 2023-04-02 01:17:03 It adds more creativity
general 2023-04-02 01:17:32 Gold bars have nothing to do with pvp
general 2023-04-02 01:18:15 Why is radar bad then?
general 2023-04-02 01:18:31 It would be fun to mess around with and it would add more players
general 2023-04-02 01:18:59 Buddy have you seen other games updating
general 2023-04-02 01:19:19 Radar could track others with missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:19:50 Human missiles are not efficient
general 2023-04-02 01:20:02 Like controlling them
general 2023-04-02 01:20:39 There could be flares and burn time
general 2023-04-02 01:21:01 Sorry for having an opinion
general 2023-04-02 01:21:08 It‚Äôs a good idea
general 2023-04-02 01:21:31 You mean 5 people?
general 2023-04-02 01:21:36 Look at suggestions
general 2023-04-02 01:22:06 An infered missile suggestion has 50 upvotes
general 2023-04-02 01:22:14 Imagine radar missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:22:23 That would be even cooler
general 2023-04-02 01:22:34 I‚Äôm comparing it to radar
general 2023-04-02 01:22:56 And 50 people like that so why wouldn‚Äôt people like radar missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:23:16 Dude you are resulting to insults when you are mad chill
general 2023-04-02 01:23:33 How so?
general 2023-04-02 01:23:54 They are both missiles that work lol?
general 2023-04-02 01:24:07 I don‚Äôt get ur point
general 2023-04-02 01:24:25 People like guided missiles?
general 2023-04-02 01:24:39 Whether radar or not
general 2023-04-02 01:24:56 Dude they are the same thing
general 2023-04-02 01:25:08 Infered missiles are the same thing????
general 2023-04-02 01:25:43 Infered tracking missiles. Radar tracking missiles, same thing?
general 2023-04-02 01:26:10 Something called locking‚Ä¶
general 2023-04-02 01:26:42 Yes
general 2023-04-02 01:27:02 They are both missiles so idk what I‚Äôm getting wrong here
general 2023-04-02 01:27:14 Sorry Lot of people and I‚Äôm. On mobile
general 2023-04-02 01:27:31 Resulting to insults now? Lol
general 2023-04-02 01:28:11 Chill bus
general 2023-04-02 01:28:14 Bus
general 2023-04-02 01:28:30 Buddy you lock on people with. Both
general 2023-04-02 01:28:50 They. Both have same tracking in Roblox buddy
general 2023-04-02 01:29:33 Bro.. this is coming from a coder???
general 2023-04-02 01:29:56 They both have same tracking system
general 2023-04-02 01:30:27 Missiles being coding, both types of missiles track the same
general 2023-04-02 01:30:37 There is no difference
general 2023-04-02 01:31:02 In my opinion, radar is just a cooler alternative
general 2023-04-02 01:31:16 Yea
general 2023-04-02 01:31:27 I think it would. Be cool üòé
general 2023-04-02 01:31:37 Missiles and stuff
general 2023-04-02 01:31:59 An addition though
general 2023-04-02 01:32:23 There is really not a lot wrong with radar lol
general 2023-04-02 01:32:40 How so?
general 2023-04-02 01:33:25 Bro I don‚Äôt mean to use radar for aware Ed‚Äôs
general 2023-04-02 01:33:30 Was
general 2023-04-02 01:33:51 Bro locking on people with radar would be cool
general 2023-04-02 01:34:05 Not for awareness in a small map
general 2023-04-02 01:34:41 Using radar for sams and stuff would be sick
general 2023-04-02 01:35:02 How is it useless?
general 2023-04-02 01:35:24 People on mobile can‚Äôt use guided missiles now that we‚Äôll anyway
general 2023-04-02 01:35:45 Plus you get warning notifications
general 2023-04-02 01:36:12 That has nothing to do what with im saying
general 2023-04-02 01:36:54 We could use radar as a missiles guidance system
general 2023-04-02 01:37:28 Bro all you people said was insults and that you can see all directions
general 2023-04-02 01:37:39 No real reasons
general 2023-04-02 01:38:07 Radar comes with radar notifications and missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:38:11 Better than inf
general 2023-04-02 01:38:33 Screen guis
general 2023-04-02 01:38:47 Bro is balding
general 2023-04-02 01:39:01 Malding
general 2023-04-02 01:39:52 Buddy this is because of altitude???
general 2023-04-02 01:40:27 How is controlling a missile yourself better than automatic missiles?
general 2023-04-02 01:41:05 Yknow how motor2s track mouse? Instead of tracking mouse they track people
general 2023-04-02 01:41:14 Big brain
general 2023-04-02 01:41:34 Only good for close range
general 2023-04-02 01:42:04 Radar missiles good for sams and stuff
general 2023-04-02 01:42:31 Radar missiles are cooler
general 2023-04-02 01:42:46 Better alternative for infered missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:43:18 50 people wanted infered missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:43:47 Radar missiles are just a cooler alternative and they add more content
general 2023-04-02 01:45:01 Look at war thunder, literally a great example of this
general 2023-04-02 01:45:07 Radar missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:45:38 Kerbal space program also has radar,
general 2023-04-02 01:45:47 Good reason to add r radar?
general 2023-04-02 01:45:57 I‚Äôll take that bet
general 2023-04-02 01:46:33 I said radar missile was a good idea, and they are now raging
general 2023-04-02 01:47:36 Anyways radar missile helps awareness, better alternative to infered, warning notifications are sick, plus If people don‚Äôt like it you can just add a no radar game mode
general 2023-04-02 01:48:35 True, but it could be better than infered missiles because it has warnings
general 2023-04-02 01:48:49 No radar mode?
general 2023-04-02 01:49:00 Flares?
general 2023-04-02 01:49:23 Limited flares and missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:50:02 Both
general 2023-04-02 01:51:00 Bro just imagine, radar missiles are same as infered missiles
general 2023-04-02 01:51:27 Well I think games like war thunder do a good job
general 2023-04-02 01:52:26 Ask me this, what other weapons can be added to plane crazy?
general 2023-04-02 01:52:56 Game will get boring with no updates to combat and shi
general 2023-04-02 01:53:24 Pc2, what other weapons will be added?
general 2023-04-02 01:53:45 It‚Äôs gonna be a bigger map, so what about radar missiles then?
general 2023-04-02 01:54:16 Time limit for an opinion??!??
general 2023-04-02 01:54:21 Crazy people

general 2023-04-02 02:17:28 Ok dummy
general 2023-04-02 02:34:41 Radar is a good edition to plane crazy, because of its warnings and missile capabilities. Radar missiles can be a better alternative to inferred  Motor2s would be able to track people when locked, and tnt would be able to explode when close enough to the target. To avoid missiles chaff would be a new block that had a certain of it amount in it. To avoid spamming of missiles you could use a cd on radar. Radar would be a step in the right direction for more realistic combat in plane crazy. To increase creativity, there could be different game modes for pvp with and without radar. Radar missiles would be able to lock onto people and then fire, and depending if the person uses flares, the missile will hit or not. Missiles would be a fun and interesting addition for veterans to experiment with. Radar missiles would be help balance against shredders, and it would help improve the game altogether. Although missiles can be easily deflected with chaff, where it will blow up on impact with that chaff, missiles help the game be reborn with a huge increase of players. Radars can use screengui and ratcast scripts to work. Thanks for reading
