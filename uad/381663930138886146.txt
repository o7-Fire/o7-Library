general 2022-08-11 04:46:59 is there any block that can be used as a counter weight?
general 2022-08-11 04:47:07 like the opposite of the helium block
general 2022-08-11 04:47:14 alright
general 2022-08-11 04:47:46 would I have stabilization issues if the ballast is in the center and not on the sides?
general 2022-08-11 04:52:04 is there any way you can turn off collision or something so that blocks can go through each other
general 2022-08-11 04:53:18 huh
general 2022-08-11 04:53:29 my own build
