general 2022-12-02 01:12:37 Its hard to implement that

general 2022-12-02 01:17:58 Chiseled, the image just doesnt sum it up enough. I have a carrier, with much more curves and superstructure than your ship, so it is hard to implement that

general 2022-12-02 01:28:04 <@527653676022628353> Teach me how to vertical fold in plane crazy.
general 2022-12-02 01:28:42 Trust me I know
general 2022-12-02 01:29:26 ngl thats funny
general 2022-12-02 01:30:58 Hey teach me how to vertical fold.
general 2022-12-02 01:32:01 yeah, but although they use like 7x7 for an example, I'm not sure on how to implement that to a 45x25x25 carrier...
general 2022-12-02 01:32:45 Yes, but I wanna make it a 3 fold, hence the reason why im trying to do vertical
general 2022-12-02 01:32:55 I dont wanna do a 10 block wide carrier
general 2022-12-02 01:33:38 Sick
general 2022-12-02 01:33:41 then teach me how to do it.
general 2022-12-02 01:34:19 Idea, how about you join me in game and show me
general 2022-12-02 01:34:28 I got off a plane legit 45 mins ago and the lag is still here
general 2022-12-02 01:34:35 hence the reason why i cannot leave sped mode
general 2022-12-02 01:34:38 alr
general 2022-12-02 01:37:26 Its funny, I have like 356 hours on the game and still dont know how to vertical fold üíÄ
general 2022-12-02 01:37:53 You say make it horizontal but flip it, and I dont know how that would look like
general 2022-12-02 01:38:11 I have literally tried 14 times, I have been counting
general 2022-12-02 01:38:37 Maybe instead of flexing, when someone ask a genuine questions and can't figure smth out, if you think its so easy just show them? like fr.
general 2022-12-02 01:39:08 "Make it horizontal but flip it" not very informal on a 45x25x25 carrier
general 2022-12-02 01:39:29 Well if you wanna help you could let me know of some more useful info
general 2022-12-02 01:39:35 instead of telling me to flip it -_-
general 2022-12-02 01:39:55 not to mention i fold differently
general 2022-12-02 01:40:12 I have jet lag, and took a 4 month break from plane crazy my guy
general 2022-12-02 01:41:06 The plan was to get it done today, but if I am this incapable of doing something so simple prob not a bad idea
general 2022-12-02 01:41:25 Please do
