plane-crazy 2021-06-08 12:49:21 that's weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 12:49:28 can understand
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:05:06 the hardest part of a rocket is not the rocket but how to even fit a capsule
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:11:22 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:11:38 You can't motor lock a capsule
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:11:48 and the fairing at once
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:12:27 For a mid size rocket, you only have 3 by 3 space with fairings

for a large size, you get 5 by 5 with fairings
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:17:45 attach a 5 stage rocket ammunition
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:17:58 or using exisiting ICBM as ammunition

creations-chat 2021-06-09 07:46:46 hey guys, motorlock my plane to 99% to add every detail including the petruding plastic in the seat which poke my rear and the paint job made in the engines saying bob the mechanic sucks as a gift when he opens the engine.

plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:53:15 they are strong
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:54:58 see what it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:55:04 if is a slow moving target
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:55:06 use it
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:55:17 if is a fast moving target, use **fireworks**
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:55:30 fire works are like auto cannons but with poor ammo
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:55:57 eh, both are poor
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:56:03 but the damage is good
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:56:31 I destroy shredders by attaching the back of my aircraft with them, they chase me, i shoot
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:57:24 Back facing is the best against shredders
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:57:48 shredders are more manuverable than your aircraft, thus attaching weapons behind while they case is an op thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:58:03 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:58:07 they are fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:58:25 to me, 200 is normal speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:58:36 because i work with propeller
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:58:50 These are what I work with
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:59:02 super rocket spam
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:59:19 I use propeller, and I use limited fuel
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:08 defeats the purpose of pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:27 like, if I fielded a idk, Curtiss Recon 1911 model
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:33 how are you gonna shoot me down
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:42 One goes 70 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:48 other goes 4000 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:00:58 you wont even pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:11 900 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:16 is still unable to shoow down
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:18 a curtiss
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:32 I've seen swarms of jets trying to attack my reconaisance plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:40 only to shoot their rockets a mile away
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:01:50 why?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:08:35 I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:08:58 The only thing remotely close i have is a Naval Bomber that can do that
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:14:29 this is my naval bomber

plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:22:00 the plane isn't meant to be nice tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:23:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:24:04 nah, to me these planes are fun to make
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:24:08 wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:24:11 imma show you
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:25:40 
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:25:49 These are stop gap fighters
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:25:57 is meant to be as wild as possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:26:29 here is a nicer looking one
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:27:38 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:27:42 resources are low
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:27:51 but you desperately need a fighter
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:28:01 thus these montrocities are made
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:28:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:29:06 making it look ugly
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:29:10 gives the feel
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:29:13 of protoype
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:29:15 and yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:29:30 Hetzer
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:31:21 T35
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:31:24 isn't stop gap
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:31:39 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-35
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:31:52 Because every nation
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:31:58 wants a multi turret tank
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:32:03 because trench warfare
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:32:21 The French, British, Germans, Soviet has them
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:32:30 Italians did not because they focus on mobile warfare
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:32:43 Thus, Italians use tankettes
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:32:57 is a joke
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:33:10 the engine noises some time makes it
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:33:26 if youplay plane crazy alot
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:33:28 not rare
the-dump 2021-06-11 03:34:13 
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:34:27 how did you get all those achievements
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:34:31 and not hear the noise
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:36:02 Test rocket?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:36:19 ew
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:36:33 External gives you the actual rocket challenge
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:36:42 Is call Capsule
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:37:21 my capsule is smaller
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:37:38 
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:25:43 the carrier royale
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:26:20 holy shoot, steam engin
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:28:39 What the hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:28:51 my carrier just went 8e 676767506306205920592059
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:32:45 is it good?
I'm not a professional shipwright
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:33:24 other build
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:33:27 ruin my confidence
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:33:41 like jeez, they got railings etc
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:19 what's consider normal to you
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:23 my normal speed is 200
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:28 for an aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:58 how much
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:01 engines do you put
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:03 I put 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:45 Mine is just a giant propeller
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:52 sometimes 2 or 3
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:37:45 Low speed is gigachad
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:37:54 yeah you got to 10 thousand speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:38:10 but what can you do
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:39:18 slow speed can dodge every attack from fast speed, save fuel, less glitchy and most of all, it's cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:39:31 slow speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:39:36 can also manuevre
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:39:38 way better
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:40:25 what do they use
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:40:33 seperate engines?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:40:51 those are for virgins. chads use  external engines for everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:41:43 You don't see plane install rocket boosters at the side of their aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:43:05 Propellers save so much fuel
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:43:23 500 fuel can fly youfor 10-15 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:43:33 in propeller
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:47:24 This is a symbol of chadness

> No Motorlock

> Propeller engine

> Limited Fuel

> Speed is 300 >

> Uncoloured Main Pilot Seat
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:50:22 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:52:07 reject motorlock, return block placing
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:52:55 I can you you use motorlock on your family's marriage
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:54:48 Virgin Motorlock: NOOOO HOW CAN I MAKE A CONE WITHOUT IT, I HATE ROBLOX

Chad Casual Player: Hmm, Pyramid Wedge.

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:25:12 Jets are too under powered
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:31:16 fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:41:00 This amount of jet engines cant even lift a main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:41:16 meanwhile, small propeller go brrr
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:41:48 that means the weight to trust ratio of jet engines are horrible
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:46:28 doesnt even lift
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:47:09 propeller
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:47:10 don't
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:47:45 Eh, to me, jet engines are still weak
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:48:11 Is a test of jet engine's strength
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:48:30 not rlly
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:48:33 just jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:48:41 propeller engines are good
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:48:52 a giant propeller can take an aircraft to 220+ speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:49:09 Jet Engines can only take it to 150+ speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:50:38 Turbo Prop is my best choice
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:50:48 Maybe a gradual lost of gravity
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:50:58 if exceeds 25 000+
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:52:40 Unless you want it to be 80 000 +
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:52:57 Turboprop test
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:53:51 Rockets that don't use limited fuel 🤮
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:54:21 real chads use 80% of their rocket on fuel blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:55:52 duh
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:56:06 there are gas station in the railway, port, airport
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:56:15 there is a reason why limited fuel exist
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 12:56:23 is for chads who dont spam super rockets

plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:11:12 someone else
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:11:17 i use it as a refernece to quality
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:11:30 his quality is what i deem good
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:11:40 mine is trying to compare
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:11:43 to see the flaws

plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:15:09 so no one gets confuse
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:15:18 but anyway the lusitania is a nightmare for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:15:22 especially the windows
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:15:33 is like putting a fucking model together
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 16:15:42 micro windows in a very small space

creations-chat 2021-10-06 16:37:11 eh, I'll try once I fix inaccuracies and angle the funnels
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:54:27 More accurate lusitania
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:54:38 the only problem is that it keep tilting
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:54:56 despite platoons, helium, ballast
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:55:41 do anyone here
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:55:45 have some miracle solution
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:55:47 to tilting
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:56:05 This is a huge build little space
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:56:27 
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:00 helium top
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:03 ballast bottom
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:43 is a 11 block wide build
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:50 nope
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:54 nearly symetrical
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:57:59 it tilts in either direction
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:58:07 meaning the build is balancing on a rock
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:58:42 
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:58:46 Yeah the hull is deep
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:59:17 alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 06:59:26 a 3 wide ballast structure
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:03:40 Nope still tilts
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:03:43 I'll increase weight
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:05:42 increase the weight works but
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:06:02 it makes it too low
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:28:23 I did try
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:28:27 I'll just
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:28:30 place them everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-07 07:30:46 ok

plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:48:14 It's a simple aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:48:19 thats why i was confuse
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:48:43 
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:48:50 massively underpowered
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:48:55 like it should be
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:03 10 graphic
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:07 cause i forgor to change it down
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:13 yeah i change to 6
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:25 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:32 is meant to be long range
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:49:54 half of the aircraft is fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:50:17 90% of my aircraft use limited fuel, and unlimited fuel is heavy
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:50:50 im surprise this one giant propeller manage to pull the thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:51:04 some of my builds when transition to unlimited fuel just kaputnik
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:51:24 oh well
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:51:27 i think is the opposite
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:52:00 eh i'll stick with limtied fuel
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:52:08 is like an extra challenge
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:52:34 the only time i use unlimited fuel is for welp, super rocket crafts
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:52:56 I know
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:53:19 i just engross
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:53:21 into it
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:53:54 limited fuel is okay
unless ur talking about rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:54:13 the aircraft uses a giant propeller
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:54:17 so it wont eat a dent
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:54:51 welp it is kinda my signature
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:55:21 so you get something to worry about
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:55:54 i use it for propellers
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:10:25 Simple CAS done
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:12:32 I posted this overlay before
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:12:42 and i got no complains
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:13:55 i think you can
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:13:59 i did mine
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 17:12:04 is this ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 03:56:11 found a way to make a fighter with only a giant propeller
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 03:56:34 and it can hold 1100 fuel
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:35:33 is this abstractly ok?
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:37:05 idk man i think he says ur a big dic?
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:37:12 or idk

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:06:09 It's the fuhrer bunker tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:06:47 i can imagine a soviet vs german soldier csgo style game can take place in it
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:07:17 soviets get the vohr section germans get the fuhrer
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:13:15 time to paint
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:21:27 kinda fat
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 15:21:56 eh if i was him i prob wouldn't try to fix it

creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:42:05 Yeah, i intended it to, inter war designs meant to look as crazy as hell
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:45:11 I just think early/inter war aircrafts look cool, cause it gives the experimental vibes, a vacation from all those jets and fighters you see in creation
Not in for the votes
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:46:57 just want to occasionally share some of my designs jeez chill
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 16:48:47 ngl i kinda want to experiment with a turbo prop aircraft
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:55:30 smh do i need to write a disclaimer of every design choice i made for the plane
basically, it's inspired by the Stipa-Caproni mixed with Grumman's series of aircraft.
I want to create a barrel shaped aircraft with space for people. Eventually i added a turret at the rear.
Just like most 1920 aircraft designs, the cockpit is opened and position at the very top for better visibility.
After that, I sorted out the engine by creating a concave shield and fitting a small giant propeller.
I intended not to use a synthetic propeller because I want the overal design to reflect an underpowered feel.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 16:57:44 I've been here for a year, I know how toxic it is, but yeah just tryna explain the design thinking of what I built
creations-chat 2022-04-23 17:06:20 smh don't start a creation war out of me explaining design choices

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:35:41 + weight from the fuck tonnes of motor lock would just drag my aircraft down

plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:36:54 infinite fuel is heavy
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:37:06 it sets a dead weight
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:37:37 finite fuel gives you the ability to reduce the dead weight
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:37:59 I worked with finite fuel alot
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:38:11 actually all my builds are finite fuel
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:38:16 including jet fighters
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:38:26 when i switch to infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:38:30 a dead weight is given
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:38:37 nope
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:39:01 no lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 02:39:05 as well

creations-chat 2022-04-24 17:57:04 They build upon request, tips and suggestions. So the fuselage looks the same but everything like engine, wingspan etc is different.

Anyway I probably would stop the design chain to here
creations-chat 2022-04-24 18:02:19 ngl, you should try these things yourself, the community may give some horrendous suggestion, but if you pick the good ones, you can slowly develop.
Just look through the previous designs and see how far it came.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 07:33:37 Nah, I sometimes deny some feedback is because it doesn't fit with the general theme.

I think the problem is people just got too satisfied with the Liquid Cooled Planes while I was going for Radial. Ofc, I made statements to try to swing the topic from lc engines to r engines that sounds like I'm angry

creations-chat 2022-04-25 11:36:21 Uncommendable. Colour is the result of imagination. White can represent anything, in this case, he is merely showing off the mechanics, not to dazzle as some cossier or some dessault. Your mere lack of understanding of the simplicity of colour would see your great temptation to downvote. He is not representing any form of vehicle, and thus do not need to paint in it in humorous colours.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:26:16 See my example, I'm creating a neutral tone, learn to use it. When you grow up and get a job, speech is appreciative to be for mutual bodies.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:41:54 john, is never an insult, his language is in a neutral tone, never inserting into an argument like sarcasm, or never aggressively painting as a negative.
I understand your anger, but is not an insult.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:48:55 I understand
I was trashed at for building a barrel plane and a radial engine plane simply because it did not suit the conventional thinking of a fighter.
But you do not need to be so aggressive in your words, instead try to exclaim your reasoning by telling them of the design choices of the era in specifical areas.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:53:13 Is simply how I give reason, I know it may sound uncanny, but I prefer to impact the audience with a more monotone speech so they can understand the details without having to be enticed by my expression.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:39:31 <@732299200624197712> Awesome use of scale, though mind showing the face. Would like to see the full concept of the build. I think people are dissatisfied with you showing the back, but I have to give you massive grants for that Pelvis and Shoulder bone detail! Don't let PCC votes discouraged you, is an excellent build that people just want to see it more materialized!
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:41:47 <@844852940291702814> Colour scheme, it is essential, I suggest you take a darker tone and more serious wooden texture on the ship. Harness the power of colour, it can make your build look professional. Remember, the votes are not to discourage you, people just think the pattern isn't suited, same for myself
I use a more darker brown for the decks and a more steel blue for the hull, should try it out.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:43:34 Try setting all the rest to like 50 based value
Then slightly increase the blue contrast by like 10-20.
Gives a metallic feel!
Plus glass should get a serious tone, like try getting it 60,60,60
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:45:41 I think the contrasting camo is the one effecting the overall patterns, you should try minimizing the contrast by making both camo patterns closer in values. Make it seem not out of place and more home groom
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:47:29 Hmm, try adding your specific green you love.
Then try to select a nice variation of it, by setting the values 10 lower (as example). Try and mix until you feel satisfied with the results
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:49:11 Try adding a slightly lighter/darker shade of green in the mix, it should work.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:58:17 <@839451762205392897> Let me help <@393527373729103888> orate his point.

From what he seems, he talks about how your flaps covers your entire wing, try to minimize it with the centre cutting through and making it look like there is variation, viable to your aircraft's ability to fly.
He also talk how the colour looks a bit plain, needs more serious tones like a darker shade to reflect the worn ability of the MiG.
Lastly he talks how the afterburner looks a bit chunky and can add more detail to make it look more streamlined. (Ask him how)
creations-chat 2022-04-25 18:00:05 Buoyancy!!!
Try adding ballast block to stabilize the ship and weighing it down, or if you're daring, enlarge the hull.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 18:01:54 Simply put, he wants your flaps to have variation and not encompass the entire wing.
Add a more serious colour scheme
Make the afterburner less chunky

Sure it doesn't look the best, but you made effort in allowing it to work, eventually you can get into further more beautiful detail!
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:30:12 <@611882188430114826> Nice submarine! though I think what steals the kilt is the colour, making it more serious tone of blue can get you somewhere further! Remember colour is essential in providing a vibrant build. Hope you improve in controlling your tempo for colours. The overall build look nice
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:31:54 <@800407883283431444> Looks awesome! I guess people got over saturated with jets and thus they compared your build to a much high standard. Don't let it down, I like your design and build, gives so many teasers.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:33:51 <@410585010295275520> I like your overall design except for the cockpit part, it feels let down for the amount of geometry you try to insert for the other parts, maybe have a darker tone for the windows as well as lifting your seat up. Looks a bit clunky, overall it has quite a good potential!
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:35:44 <@700761272282775593> Awesome!!! Just like retro's jet, felt that the community just got a bit tired of jets thus they compared it to different standard. Don't let it down, I'm a fan of that build!

plane-crazy 2022-05-03 08:42:53 ok last picture
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:13:58 I gave him a sliver of hope by talking about his creativity and his adventurism.
I think he was heavily unexpected of how PCC expect builds to be on a high level. 
He is inexperience like me in high-level motorlocking, thus he would be absolutely blown out of the water in creations. Seeing his build, despite heavy and dedicated improvements (yes he upgraded it multiple times) and still flopping was his last straw.

Man dedicated alot of time to improve his build, but PCC ignores and treats it as a triple A contest.
this is what saddens me
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:16:43 Other things are those self entitled and glorified "critics" which basically gives you no advice but shitting on you. They are a thorn to PCC seriously.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:18:50 From what I can infer, is too late to change, PCC's attitude has already bloated up to no return. New players will have to deal with the toxic atmosphere PCC now host.
You can't change the minds of thousand, is irreversible.
Guess PCC is a tale on how a building game community can become super toxic and egotistic.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:22:57 There is a fine line between judging. Like I said before, PCC is filled with self entitled critics, who will spit, shit on your builds and expect you to learn from insults.
What I prefer is actual helping.

creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:25:34 True true, just think downvoting should be followed by reasoning.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:27:17 He did not beg, he just says is his first vtol, then after many suggestions and tips, he upgraded his build to the current one you see. He just wants to achieve what the community wants, but the community always set the goal post higher

so he just gave up.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:28:59 It's a human emotional reaction. If you see your build get disliked, you would want to get it liked. That's his mentality.

Ah I see, alright
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:31:01 Because it's the actual paint job given
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:34:43 When you post a creation, you want it to show to the community what you build. Right?
His mentality is just like yours, however he is new. Unlike you, who is an expert, he can only go so far. 
He wants his build to succeed, but it did not.
Sure, there is people like me who shrug off the dislikes, but there is some who feel a more personal attachment, and therefore couldn't cope.

You should learn/ ponder a bit of phycology, it can help shift your view
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:39:07 I have no interest in roles, I play this game to build, I post in creation to share, and sometimes I give advice I can think of.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 10:39:26 Agreed.
A simple wedge is the same as a complicated motorlock fiasco
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 09:15:57 what do u think

creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:33:35 looks nice, what's the issue with it?
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:37:13 Looks good, i would have upvoted it
Yeah sure, there might be mistakes, but is due to the limitation of the techniques he use, so i'm giving him a thumbsup.
Sure you might say the front looks bland, but I say it fits well, it's a unique and fun design, so yeah i like it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:40:04 It looks appealing, practical and does a overall job in making it seem smooth, so yeah i like it

dunno, might be me having  poor man eyes unlike your experienced one, but for an average joe, i just think is nice and should be appreciated
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:41:45 <@793132196810588200> got some mistakes, suggest fixing it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:45:40 <@938196250791141386> welp, if you dont want to add detail but make it nicer, suggest colour swapping, make it a serious tone, too much brighties, make them darker, and smoother transition of camo
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:49:15 lol, for me i just sketch out my designs, and try to build and change of of the designs to make it work, maybe like build a design criteria then build the thing
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:51:01 A fantastic aircraft, using innovative 4 propeller design, and expertly fitting them by moving a block behind, it graciously and perfectly created what seems to be a practical deadly pvp aircraft. The engines are attach on a bar, ingenius as it can fit those bombs. Great amount of flaps to improve it's flexibility
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:52:45 hope you find it, i often bury drawings under piles of trash if is 4 years of age

the-dump 2022-05-14 01:06:52 uh oh
the-dump 2022-05-14 11:35:01 wait what how is it inappropriate
the-dump 2022-05-14 11:35:09 wtf
the-dump 2022-05-14 11:36:26 bruh doesnt even violate any rules
the-dump 2022-05-14 11:37:40 <@370594904268734464> what was i warned for???
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:06:08 politics?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:06:13 Religion?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:06:23 is just a blood and iron character
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:08:45 the other meme is a fucking car
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:08:55 and the other one is trench warfare characters
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:10:09 If you proclaim is at what is call, 18+, then do remind yourself of the situation and evaluate what have been removed and the language of the apparent images.
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:10:37 Did you evaluate every still frame? Did you comprehend every form of language presented in the video?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:11:07 In what you deem as breaking rule 2, I ponder your judgement
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:13:21 Apparently, he just warned me because someone else pinged him with the reply after i posted the host.
If he did pay attention, then I'm surprise of the great takes he took to evaluate the information
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:13:56 Even so, the context has been removed, and should be judge with new inherit situation
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:16:50 I'm questioning the judgement of what seems to be an innocent take of a meme
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:17:17 ok, i still want reason
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:17:28 vaguely
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:17:41 he never designate the apparent reason
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:03 he needs to be clearer
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:14 he needs
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:34 I can proclaim you to break rule 9, from the entirety of the history of your messages
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:18:50 That's why I ask
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:05 Yes
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:08 I want to know why?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:18 vaguely
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:22 not clear
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:38 I want to see the justification
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:48 there is 3-4 different designation
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:19:51 How.
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:20:08 This is the paradox you're creating
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:20:19 Tell me, not vaguely, clearly
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:20:37 This
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:20:52 how the hell is it breaking politics, religion and 18+
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:02 the desired context has been removed
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:12 it's now merely suggestive
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:21 a warn without possible justification
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:35 and given with a vague reason
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:42 thus one must inquire why?
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:21:44 so I asked
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:20 I'm trying to justify
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:27 or if some call it lashing out
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:22:47 because of the unfound justification of the warn
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:23:07 thus I laid my questioning, objections and defense
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:23:11 which spiralled into this
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:24:31 alright
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:25:30 is plane crazy
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:25:34 what do you expect
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:59:50 yes
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:59:52 I read
the-dump 2022-05-14 14:59:56 what?

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 13:46:11 i dont get why people wants to copy my bi plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:00:59 yeah, it's only complicated part is the bomb bay, pistoned up chair and a turnable turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 07:11:01 so
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 07:11:27 
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:54:53 so
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:05:47 welp
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:12:24 oh yeah, why do i keep seeing thi
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:12:57 heavy fighter thing, used a smaller engine for less fuel intensive plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:16:29 im amatuer at motorlock, so some parts are detailed, some aren't
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:16:48 12 giant propeller vs my fuel
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:17:04 
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:19:20 i put limited fuel because i like the challenge
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:19:28 hell even fighter jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:19:33 have fuel
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:20:30 (30 thousand to fuel like 12 super rockets, will equate to roughly 5 minutes of flight)
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:21:40 plus limited fuel actually decrease weight
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:22:44 block is like 1 weight
fuel block decrease once is used up
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:23:07 some of my jet fighters, who has 30 thousand fuel basically
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:23:12 become way lighter
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:23:19 after like a long flight
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:24:12 nah it's fun to have a mechanic where you have a time out on how long you can fly
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:24:21 sometimes i had to refill mid pvp battle
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:25:12 normally, a single giant engine just need ~500 fuel
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:25:16 for me
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:25:50 i don't like hovers
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:25:55 if i wan't to make something faster

plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:26:05 Slap a larger engine
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:26:22 220 speed can be pushed
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:26:43 normally is 180-200, i can push to 220-230 with a turboprop
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:27:06 what's worth with the extra speed?
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:27:44 For me, i prefer jets going to 300-600
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:28:15 for me is fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:28:49 not really practical
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:29:14 I just like slapping underpowered engines or overpowered engines

plane-crazy 2022-06-26 07:10:25 yes pp shooter
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:06:26 I tried making a pvp aircraft with only 1 huge jet engine
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:07:00 not the nicest, i guess
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:09:33 tried my best, the weird look is to manage the engine
jet engines stall fast and need to take time to increase speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:10:06 so I place the tail wing super high like a stol-ish design
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:10:56 is so I can see clearer
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:10:58 because the plane is heavy rear
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:13:05 
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:15:06 it's gonna fracture the wing balance i believe
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:15:35 literately looks like this lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 10:17:19 nice, you improved it

plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:23:36 throwing a powerful engine erm
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:47:18 Well, my idea was a 1920 niche bomber design so is kinda boxy
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:49:22 ngl i like that aesthetic, it really gives off the interwar feel, thats why i kept it, is more for practical design than looks, since i challenged myself with harsh limitations
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:50:43 sure
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:57:38 
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:58:01 very simple
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:58:04 ^^
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 13:59:58 i prefer giant propellers anyway, is basically my way of adding extra power to one unit
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:05:54 i've used them before
if you don't know why im using them, is because i force myself with heavy limitations as a way to challenge and see what the fuck i made
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:06:36 for me, is easier to use 2 giant propeller than having a massive weight of an actual contra rotating custom propeller
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:06:53 the plane is already heavy from the 30 bombs it carried
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:08:37 ?
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:09:32 ngl i still dont really get pcc's stuff
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:09:55 why is the entire server so depress
creations-chat 2022-11-09 14:12:35 seems like someone is coping hard fr
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 14:12:48 oh

plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:28:54 limited fuel 💪
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:35:44 it flies 160 speed, with propeller no helium
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:35:58 rockets basically is cheating
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:36:48 wait till you see all my builds
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:39:23 limited fuel propeller bomber can last like 30-40 minutes non stop flying
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:39:43 unlimited is heavier tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:40:18 if you use limited, you realize after flying long flights, fuel blocks become light
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:40:44 source: i played this have for 4 goddam years with limited fuel
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:17 fr fr, i can show you
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:19 i got 1 plane
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:28 that has a very significant fuel problem
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:35 no, is the most prominant tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:39 nah
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:42 i have other planes
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:45 that fly faster
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:41:48 after longer flights
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:42:17 no
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:42:20 all my jets
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:42:23 use
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:42:26 limited fuel

plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:43:01 i slap tons of fuel blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-16 05:43:45 theres 1 fighter that become so light that it's front nose fucking lifts from the ground

plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:38:30 good already
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:39:16 unless you can somehow motorlock a 4 by 1 wedge by 5 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:39:35 (additional 102 blocks added)
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:39:45 don't lol

plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:43:19 is good enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:43:39 there is no time crying over every detail, you just build it up and fly that shit
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:44:37 my expertise is not as big
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:44:44 i just know basic
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:44:46 motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:18 erm
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:25 acceptance
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:28 could be key
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:52 some path equations
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:54 math
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:45:57 has 1 answer
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:46:07 i might try actually
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:46:44 erm why don't you solve it
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:47:08 then i think what you made is good enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:47:41 like this
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:47:44 is already
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:47:48 having is shape
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:47:54 just that the b is a bit italic
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:48:07 if you want a flatter surface
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:48:08 seems good
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:48:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:49:25 if you aren't catching on what im saying

basically, sometimes nomatter how much you try, there is only a limited amount of answer that doesn't fit in, like a curve
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:49:49 
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:49:56 B's spine
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:49:58 has a thick
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:49:59 shame
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:01 so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:03 is good enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:06 top one fits
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:15 is good
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:20 ye
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:26 it's spine is fat like the font
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:50:47 yeah, maybe the simpliest is the best solution yet
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:51:00 the font looks good tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:51:22 the font u made looks perfect
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:51:23 alr
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:51:30 just try to fit it in
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:52:06 what does it spell
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:52:07 lol
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:52:31 oh
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:52:44 limitations from the blocks tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:53:46 flying boat that can carry a decent amount of payload
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:53:53 torpedoes or bombs
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:04 move the slids
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:06 forward
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:07 idk
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:19 idk
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:22 maybe try
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:25 something like
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:27 practical
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:37 practicality and trying it to fly is kinda satisfying
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:44 fuck it
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:54:48 use the previous one
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:00 font matching
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:08 the one where you say "good"
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:18 he doesnt want to use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:24 works
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:30 his space
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:55:31 is limited
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:28 erm
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:31 hes gonna make
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:34 the 2nd half
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:38 on the other plot
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:55 you dont see people fly a sawed off blimp
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:56:59 the empty half
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:57:21 erm
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:57:23 he needs to fit
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:57:26 the other half
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:57:58 average pcc
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:58:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:58:06 but what space
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:59:18 the 3 block squeeze
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 11:59:22 between the lettering
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:00:38 pcc is like the worse area to get help
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:01:01 <@678279674782285824> i think what kim is trying to say is put the sign in the zep
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:01:55 everything for a font
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:01 mr uea
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:04 says theres no space
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:05 to fit
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:08 so he use generic shape
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:14 and then the pcc experts
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:16 says
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:19 he cause use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:27 if he saw his zep in half
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:46 hes using it to make a sign
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:02:56 yeah

plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:28:13 14k
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:28:41 the jet uses the fuel up
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:28:44 that after 5 mins
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:28:48 is lighter
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:29:02 than it is, if is an average block
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:29:21 im actually surprise people don't know fuel blocks loses weight after being used
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:29:46 yeah

plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:30:04 airport
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:30:45 if they push a fuel block on a refueling area
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:30:51 u can also
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:30:53 refuel mid air
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:30:59 if you fly close enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:31:05 to the refueling area
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:31:37 i use fuel blocks because erm, i feel cool knowing that my plane will cease to fly after a limited time
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 12:34:10 average jetfighter with a decent speed (~550+) uses like 8-12 engines

if you have 15k fuel, it rounds out at around 7-10 minutes if i remember
