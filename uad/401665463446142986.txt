plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:58:16 better engine exhaust would be nice ngl
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:01:46 Engine exhaust like a raptor engine, or an f1 engine would be pretty great, with an option to turn off the exhaust
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:02:11 The normal engine exhausts aren't the worst but they dont seem like an engine, the exhaust doesnt really reach far
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:21:52 working on a starship SN15
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:21:55 Oh nvm no image persm
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:46:45 Isn't helium a form of stabilizing rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:47:11 I always use wings layed out in a pattern
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:47:25 - - - - -
| | | | | |
- - - - -
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:47:30 This type of pattern
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:47:57 Then i use a few super engines for yaw and pitch
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:48:28 But sometimes I do add a roll thrust
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:08:48 nah their vertical
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:08:55 They are vertical but still follow that pattern
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:09:26 and now im using pistons for starship landing legs
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:09:44 its not the BFR its just the SN15 prototype
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:09:52 I have no clue how to do the BFR legs lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:18:02 yeah the booster
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:18:07 im talking about the actual ITS legs
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:18:16 They come out of an aerodynamic shell i think
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:18:24 and I have no clue how to do that
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:18:51 gotta finish the nose cone for SN15 tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:19:59 Im using lock for pistons.
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:20:02 And toggle
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:20:15 Press G for the struts to come out and because they are locked they dont move
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:20:54 However im using normal 1x1 blocks for the fins
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:21:03 I could change them to wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:22:15 I already have aerodynamics worked out with a bunch of wings inside the rocket hull
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:22:34 The fins on the side that pivot are only for decoration and realism pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 16:57:57 my starship can do a belly flop. but its pretty tedious because I used wings as stabilization
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:27:30 Finished the starship
creations-chat 2021-05-08 18:01:02 yeah the whole machine would be nice
general 2021-05-08 18:09:19 Has anyone here heard of or played Alien isolation?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:14:04 You can also store some timy things in a soda can
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:14:06 keys ect

general 2021-05-08 18:35:50 But you better hide your wife because i've got a knife
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:37:21 I flew Sn15 to mars.... oh wait were not on the topic of dimwits flying ships to canyons.
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:28:50 I have no clue about motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:29:03 I spend my time making rockets and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:29:15 Gonna go finish the SN15 I started before

bot-central 2021-05-08 19:50:09 How does that
bot-central 2021-05-08 19:50:10 Oh wait
creations-chat 2021-05-08 22:42:52 I put 2 because i had one version with the launch pad and one without and i didnt want to put the same name twice

And I built the one with the launchpad first so the second was one without pretty much
general 2021-05-08 23:30:46 Im not blunt and arrogant so I think its really amazing
general 2021-05-08 23:30:52 Good job
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:32:31 Dunno
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:32:43 I donated money but never got it
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:32:56 I think it is just like a flex
general 2021-05-09 10:20:02 lol
general 2021-05-09 10:20:24 Relatable
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 21:05:24 Imagine different planets in plane crazy like another map a few thousand meters from the earth map
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 21:05:59 That would be laggy and odd but it could be cool making rockets to fly to these other maps or something
general 2021-05-28 16:39:50 Falcon heavy creation on roblox studio Each part is seperate so you can pose it easily
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:25:33 Gonna make a functional sea dragon
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:26:10 Im gonna need a lot of ballast tanks to completely pivot it upright
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:26:16 Or one
