creations-chat 2020-06-03 20:39:05 What would be a good thing to use for rails (like fences) for a ship?
creations-chat 2020-06-03 20:39:44 Thanks!
creations-chat 2020-06-03 21:43:28 honestly sounds tempting
help 2020-06-03 21:50:04 Is it better to make an elevator using friction blocks (idk how they work) or just use 1x0.9 blocks?
creations-chat 2020-06-03 22:11:39 Does the panoramic view room look ok? Or do you think it should be a seating area that has bars etc so it looks like a normal one?
creations-chat 2020-06-04 16:46:37 the shape looks good but the camo could be better üëç
creations-chat 2020-06-04 20:54:28 I need some ideas of what to build in my entertainment area on my cruise. Anyone got any?
creations-chat 2020-06-04 21:01:48 ?
creations-chat 2020-06-04 21:02:33 i prefer the other way round
creations-chat 2020-06-04 21:07:12 This is it so far, there will be another deck with the bridge on it, a full sinking mechanism, full ship lighting, working elevators and lifeboats. Also that big glass room on B Deck is a Panoramic Viewing Room, should I keep it or change it to a normal seating area?
bug-reports 2020-06-04 21:26:02 When I change my time from night to day, the lighting kinda screws up and makes the game look quite dim even though it is meant to be day. It can fix when you quickly change your time from day-night again but it is very annoying when I'm doing something with lighting then start building and the game is really dim.
creations-chat 2020-06-04 22:01:03 Awesome man!
creations-chat 2020-06-04 22:01:31 I never plan anything in advance, I just start building and kinda... go with it.
creations-chat 2020-06-06 23:17:49 Has anyone got a modern lifeboat they don't mind sharing for me to use on my cruise? I'm struggling to build a good one lol
creations-chat 2020-06-06 23:37:19 <@!480746414293647360> thanks will try now üëç

bug-reports 2020-06-07 21:07:00 > After despawning my creation my gui freezes for around 30 seconds
<@!551806781609869313> happens to me aswell
creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:53:21 is it just me or has the motor 2 just broke recently
creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:54:05 like im trying to build a folding door for my plane and when i use it sometimes it goes 1 way sometimes it goes the other (pressing the same key and no configurements)
help 2020-06-12 16:30:16 Ok so for some reason whenever my friend spawns his plane a block appears under his front landing gear out of nowhere and we can‚Äôt find where it‚Äôs coming from. Is this just a glitch that spawns a block because it seems to go through the landing gear aswell?
help 2020-06-12 16:32:35 Ok update it only does it at normal base, it doesn‚Äôt spawn when he is at the airport
help 2020-06-12 16:39:40 Hi thanks for the suggestion, it‚Äôs too high to raise but for some reason he can‚Äôt lower it even through there is 4-5 blocks under it
help 2020-06-12 16:41:23 
help 2020-06-12 16:42:38 Wait
help 2020-06-12 16:42:42 We think we have found it

creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:24:54 ok so im currently building a plane, it has two fuselage folds and fsr it shakes like CRAZY whenever I unfold it and i cant get it to stay normal. anybody have the same problem or is it just me?
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:25:31 ^ it just does that idk how to fix it
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:27:04 i used the normal motor that didnt work, i just set both motor 2s to 89.99 and it still does the same thing
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:29:58 yeah cause they need to unfold
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:32:41 <@!387195148741771275> you can't lock motor 2-
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:33:12 no bcos its angled at 85 degrees to look more realistic
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:34:19 see the ends look  lot more realistic with the slight bend
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:34:43 this is my first plane ive built lol dont judge
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:35:27 no second i built my sr-71 a while ago but meh
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:36:02 my sr-71 is terrible
creations-chat 2020-10-03 15:41:20 upvoting your own build is like buying laced shoes but not knowing how to tie them.
there's no point.
