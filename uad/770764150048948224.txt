creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:14:10 <@!346438146549874688> Where is the back of the seat...

--No it is usually much taller
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:18:00 Alright how did you 2 fools get the sit down pose with no actual chair
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:21:22 Hm never heard of that
help 2021-10-10 06:23:56 Stfu i figured it out now
help 2021-10-10 06:24:29 Always going to be one like you though
help 2021-10-10 06:27:37 wait wait hold on the help request was actually half justified
help 2021-10-10 06:28:21 i didn't ask why i could not post an image, i asked why my creation post was being rejected
help 2021-10-10 06:29:37 Yes
help 2021-10-10 06:29:49 i had a link for image
help 2021-10-10 06:29:53 yes
help 2021-10-10 06:30:20 the whole messgae was alt space C'd by a message
help 2021-10-10 06:30:23 bot
help 2021-10-10 06:34:34 Understand from this perspective, there is no file button in that channel. Naturally you go and get an embed link for the picture and video. you type your description. You add the links. You hit post, only to have the messgae deleted by a bot instantly. You get a DM saying the channel is for images only. Confused, you go to help right away after not seeing anything about this ever. You then go to the rule and info channels and find out why. You try to rank up. way later. a pretentious bird with a redditor name pings you with a "subtle" "you stupid" message
help 2021-10-10 06:34:49 i know all the rules and stuff, just forget about it.
help 2021-10-10 06:36:19 Bro i know all of this where have you been
help 2021-10-10 06:36:22 you are late
help 2021-10-10 06:36:32 It has been figured out
help 2021-10-10 06:36:47 Sorry but this other dude
help 2021-10-10 06:36:50 my bad
help 2021-10-10 06:36:51 damn

help 2021-10-10 06:37:40 Don't  have time for this right now
help 2021-10-10 06:37:58 haha trust me i am
help 2021-10-10 06:38:13 some of you just need to learn when not to speak
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:47:22 A-12- I do realize it could be better in some areas. What are your first impressions on seeing this?

other than the cockpits being not fully closed and the glitchy motor 2 slots on bottom and the atrocious spikes*
Also how the engines are not angled/bent and are too straight like expo markers
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:49:24 Yes the paint could be lighter. But what does 'pencil' mean?
creations-chat 2021-10-10 06:51:28 Explain <@!489806344388345857>  <@!715148402022678608>
creations-chat 2021-10-10 14:34:56 a little bit messy, the colors are confusing at first. takes a minute of inspecting to see what it is
help 2021-10-10 14:41:13 Dude shut up. i get that i was "unrespectable," but your bird cult needs to cut this high and mighty correcting shit. Yes, i was wrong. Not going to make excuses for being unreasonably irritable but stfu though
help 2021-10-10 14:46:23 Any advice for filling this block?
help 2021-10-10 15:03:52 Did you even read the whole conversation.....
1- The root problem was not being able to post in creations. The cause was no image perms, but that was not fully clear at the time. After all, the message bot would instantly remove my message with no explanation other than "this is image only channel"
2-This has been figured out. What are you doing using present tense...
3- Ego? Funny thing, that word is the first thing  any  self claiming 'intellectual' would cling to. Besides, ego means self image pretty much. Tell me if you used the right context üôÑ
help 2021-10-10 15:04:52 So that being said, this whole argument is a "just stop..." moment. So this is it. Quit pinging me about it, and forget it. Sorry about this, now shut up.
help 2021-10-11 05:40:32 Has anyone figured out how to round square cockpit windows yet? (Couldn't get wing panels to work without exposed motor)
help 2021-10-11 05:40:33 
help 2021-10-11 05:44:03 hm just realised that the underside of the nose is concave but should be convex : l
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:04:43 Which *looks better* concave or convex hold on slowdown

Convex:https://streamable.com/h11zkf
help 2021-10-11 06:08:19 Yes exactly like this. I have been pulling hair over this, because the panel clips into the window or is too far out
help 2021-10-11 06:09:05 let me guess: round wedge in/out tilted
help 2021-10-11 06:09:12 with motorlock
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:11:17 Look at the bottom of nose.

<@!401530469952389130>  what are you talking about? wide? the streamable picture is not folded
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:13:36 Now look at the bottom of nose
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:15:37 i ahev since fixed them to be the maximum size i could reasonably and proportionally have
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:19:54 Ok have to unfold rq ; still probably going to reduce "width" but not rn because all the work
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:29:45 <@!401530469952389130>  The red arrow is about where it ended until I started redoing the wings yesterday
creations-chat 2021-10-11 06:33:51 I think what you are seeing is the difference in sweep angle. Notice how much more vicious the sweep is as seen here.  The wingtips "end" closer to the tail.
help 2021-10-11 06:59:04 Where does the problem even start....  (There are no controls or moving parts other than the rotor. The Helicopter is however a NOTAR class) https://streamable.com/s658ft
help 2021-10-11 07:01:08 It is NOTAR. can't do that.
help 2021-10-11 07:01:43 Which literally means "no tail rotor"
creations-chat 2021-10-11 07:22:24 Yeah that's all in the works... But it will take quite some work to get it
help 2021-10-11 07:23:08 Yes but prop engines...
help 2021-10-11 07:23:25 ü§Æ
help 2021-10-11 07:23:59 Ok
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:48:52 Surface air missile? Why is it so blocky....
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:50:54 The missile is blocky
use like a 2x2 cylinder and center it... it doesn't have to be in sclae you know
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:52:56 look the entire thing is a block and yeah exposed lock
creations-chat 2021-10-11 17:55:06 Yes that, it would be possible with some centered 2x cylinders easily
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:15:56 üòï
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:16:46 Cool idea though
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 18:17:39 dude next to me is something else
creations-chat 2021-10-11 18:24:14 Blue/white camo to blend with sky maybe or something like this

creations-chat 2021-10-11 18:55:03 <@!714878625484243101>  99% of camos are blocky, unless you motorlock some wedges for smooth edges. Don't worry about it though, most people don't notice

creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:38:35 ok yeah... i see now
creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:42:07 Well it is british  you could probably never make anything good out of it

creations-chat 2021-10-14 00:17:31 I was implying it is a terrible idea
creations-chat 2021-10-14 00:44:47 Why is your screenshot so bleached out
creations-chat 2021-10-14 00:48:46 hm
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:07:37 The frame is nice, however, the weapons are dramatically under detailed and ruin the entire look. The ship looks like it is having an argument with itself. Try removing some of the cluttered weapons
also the color isn't right
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:10:49 This car is under detailed too and is lacking smoothness from what i see. Can you give 1 or 2 more angles? can't really tell much.
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:12:56 More photographic angles
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:17:17 This is like the space boat. The color and overall design is overall bland. However, this build also has a nice base. Add to it! Consider a darker color and more texture to it.
creations-chat 2021-10-14 02:22:20 what are your current codes?

bug-reports 2021-11-06 05:15:35 Roblox crashes when my avatar is shot while seated in fly mode. It has nothing to do with performance and is an instant freeze.

creations-chat 2021-11-11 20:44:07 ^something like this if you do not know what i mean
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:19:40 Whats wrong with that
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:19:48 Looks sick
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:20:46 Aside from the obvious things like youtubers and fans there is nothing wrong with either fortnite or naruto
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:20:50 Well actually Naruto is a little bit childish
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:23:36 Well because most of the people in PCC are 11-16 which is a crowd known to to be divided into "likes something" and "hates it because everyone else does"
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:23:41 also fuck PCC
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:24:30 because it is fun to come here now and then
the-dump 2021-11-18 02:24:42 But for the most part this place sucks

creations-chat 2021-11-28 02:07:57 Hey can someone give me some honest thoughts on the Bavarium helicopter in creations... Radio silence so far and i know it is not perfect
creations-chat 2021-11-28 15:11:44 yeah it's just really hard to get gold in plane crazy, it pretty much unconditionally turns out cheese
help 2021-11-29 01:09:41 anyone got a compact 6 six blade rotor? is it even possible
help 2021-11-29 01:10:01 You don't have to tell me how either just give some hope
help 2021-11-29 01:15:00 that is definitely not compact, almost identical to my design actually
help 2021-11-29 01:15:40 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/913939591042588753 see how ridiculously oversized the swashplate part is? thats th problem
help 2021-11-29 01:27:01 ok might be on to something here
help 2021-11-29 01:28:13 well yeah it compresses, but at least it will be an improvement over the weird cylinder of last design glued to the top of the helicopter
help 2021-11-29 01:54:20 oh yeah i made a mistake in my help request
help 2021-11-29 01:54:32 I am actually needing a compact 8 blade design
help 2021-11-29 02:18:36 see the only problem is that it is still not small enough
help 2021-11-29 02:18:55 : (
help 2021-11-29 02:22:04 because look at this older design, new is better but not very much. Also nobody seems to have any better solutions so it's either new or 4 blades
help 2021-11-29 02:22:25 look at how fucking ugly the rotor used to be
help 2021-11-29 02:22:37 unsatisfactory
help 2021-11-29 02:23:41 does *anybody* have a compact 8 blade
help 2021-11-29 02:30:53 yeah that's  what i have been doing the whole time
help 2021-11-29 03:29:55 Hey also thanks to those that helped, appreciate it
creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:34:37 Ayo if you downvote that's fine, but it would reaaallly help if one were to give a reason so it could be fixed later
creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:38:46 DOn't remember any Mirage IV s of note

Hm guess i'm wrong... Are there any actual good ones though
creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:41:14 Yeah and they aren't exactly good either, so there you go kiernen. Make a *good* mirage

creations-chat 2021-11-29 03:45:33 Yeah peaceful-ish industrial shit in general is a lot less abundant
creations-chat 2021-11-30 02:27:28 No this is Medici (JC3) flag you just cannot see the three golden stars in the picture
creations-chat 2021-12-09 03:27:05 Cool
creations-chat 2021-12-09 03:52:01 Hey anyone know how to prevent motor 2 control surfaces from losing their mind while using camera fold but at the same time not altering their looks

vague problem but since camera folds are instant they need to be still the first 1 second
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:00:30 Let me show instead on this build i am making. Half of the time thery will glitch into neighboring parts and get stuck a good chunk of time

In this clip it gets very close, enough to show the problem. Notice the wing on the right side does yet another motor glitch
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:03:27 Unfortunately, this is not a bug report. This is a request to solve a daily glitch involving servos and how to seamlessly fix it

And please, take it easy.

You are partially correct, but the right channel is <#478584971670454284>  for this. üôÑ
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:06:17 Because even though i personally hate the intonation of those words it is the highest chance of comprehension and clarity
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:12:25 Calm down.

You understand exactly what I say, which is the entire point of talking. There is no reason to be angry or throw around insults. 

I am just asking if anyone know how to fix the problem with delayed motor parts. If you ever tried to yourself, you would know that few combinations of signs and disconnectors are plausible and aesthetically pleasing at the same time. I have not found this combo.

On top of that, why are some of you saying "shakespeare" and "talk like that?" this is a fairly common vocab level and it is not like i am one of the assholes who abandons short words to be pretentious
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:17:41 What essay.... dude if you think what i am saying is complicated that is a sign you should have fucking listened in 5th grade. 
Don't play dumb guys, you almost certainly understand me clearly. There is seemingly an attitude of intentionally dumbing things down just to be more sociable or something. Explain the irrational hostility though
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:20:09 Bro use your listening ears
i am not talking about the build, i am talking about a problem i am having while making the thing. there is a pretty clear difference there. Yes, the build is not good. However, that is not what the discussion is about
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:41:07 Why are you mad bro?  You probably have a background hate and anger towards this personality because you may have acted the same way a while ago,  and the personality frustrates you. I am aware that the best course of action is to just take the high road and stop perpetuating this disaster.  However, i did not provoke any of you for the first handful of messages. Who is in the wrong?

 You are really angry at me for being annoying! As an unknown source said, "Just fucking close your eyes lol, walk away from the screen." What ails you?

<@!471802613168603173> It is a camera fold, so the fold is instant. Normally, a regular motor would be ideal but because i plan to use this frame as a pvp bombing machine, time is money. It would work in non pvp, but that would leave a floating motor which is unacceptable.  

as for the rest of you, again, all of this is in search of a way to bind the control surfaces for a very short time so that they will not get stuck all the time. That is it. The PCC above have distorted it to be a bug report or about my build somehow lol. This is not a complaint about a bug. i am asking how to get around this common bug (possible) in an efficient way to get the fastest start possible and not ruin the looks of the build for when i start working on aesthetic of it. Before any smartasses respond with  some irrelevant whiny jab, consider that there is no reason to be mad.
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:43:49 No, keep replying. This is good pre-sleep stimulation as well as written proof of PCC's fucking ailment
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:47:55 yes that's what the plan is

<@!347918144062488586> Clearly you didn't understand the context. I was not writing the messages of what you call hate about the problem i was mainly talking about the other problem, nobody pays attention before replying. You are a great example of this
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:51:52 woah woah i am not raged, just a little irritated. The goal isn't to be smart or have perfect grammar, just to get my point to all of you in clear and concise words. Again x2 i never provoked any of this falsely returned rage that you have been throwing at me.
You know it says something about social reading when you can't understand white and black intentions behind  my messages and connect the dots üòî 
so many conclusions jumped to
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:54:36 Damn, a reused joke. Sucks for you man. And point me to the mf who doesn't understand the common, basic ELA
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:57:08 Do  none of you think, read, comprehend before typing? remember what your mother told you, wait 20 seconds before replying  and think it through

There is no need for this anger
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:59:19 Finally, can rest with the last word later lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 18:45:36 Why you should switch to Build n Destroy
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 03:42:29 Someone make an actual quality architecture build of a base or something
creations-chat 2022-01-19 20:27:00 U-41 Ptakojester, about 85% done what you guys think

creations-chat 2022-01-19 21:20:46 Haven't finished yet
creations-chat 2022-01-19 21:24:37 Wings, Nose and front body need some major smoothing too and there are some stray disconnectors as well as needs a bit more DRM signs
But nobody else has pointed anything else out
creations-chat 2022-01-19 21:39:04 Yep
creations-chat 2022-01-19 21:41:05 Yeah the front is pretty rough
creations-chat 2022-01-19 22:00:12 mentally fold it then
creations-chat 2022-01-19 22:29:20 Bro that is a garbage heap of misplaced wedges
creations-chat 2022-01-19 22:55:34 Yeah it looks like an actual clown face
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:02:35 yeah been working on it

Wym from the front, close up?

injured did not mean to reply to you
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:08:09 Yeah nothing special yet
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:12:07 you could send a google drive folder
doubt anyone would bother with it

Or Streamable.com
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:14:17 How many pictures are we talking here
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:16:35 Hm might as well make a video then

And it is a slideshow of the pics
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:19:37 up to you what you decide to do again you can use streamable send a .zip  or make an mp4 slideshow
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:22:54 What are you tryingto do
what type of file
creations-chat 2022-01-19 23:26:01 Dude either remove some picture or something or make a slidwshow then or use streamable

As in looks clumsy sort of
creations-chat 2022-01-20 07:24:52 Is this the new home of the dump
creations-chat 2022-01-23 17:00:46 Made some improvements especially to nose smoothing

creations-chat 2022-01-23 17:16:41 The motors?

They don't actually do anything but make control surfaces that i do not use
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:18:21 Because i did not feel like making it blocky 

1 block= too thick
half block= no right wedges
creations-chat 2022-01-23 17:19:45 Very little i can or want to do about that

making it  half block looked messy and clumsy
One block was farrr to thick
Making a custom slope had exposed motors and didnt look right
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:24:56 It is what it is 
Actually do not know what to do about it
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:26:31 How do the elevators and rudders look now that they are not paper thin either
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:30:27 And does this engine exhaust part look good
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:33:29 Probably will never finish the damn build
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:35:53 
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:52:48 The canopy would probably be a little better shiny and the nose looks like it is flat for a half block near the end
creations-chat 2022-01-29 22:54:57 Maybe make the pyramid block go back one half blck until it meets the half wedge, or make a longer half wedge with some angle locking
creations-chat 2022-01-29 23:11:06 No i can make it brighter
creations-chat 2022-01-29 23:14:35 Why did you say regular material though
creations-chat 2022-01-30 21:16:36 Rebel paint version
creations-chat 2022-01-30 21:18:49 
creations-chat 2022-02-03 00:49:33 How is this been doing more work on the second paint style
creations-chat 2022-02-03 00:55:26 Thank you bro
creations-chat 2022-02-03 01:03:32 Probably a paradox where the glass trend came from that post but that post was a time travel glass trend
creations-chat 2022-02-03 01:36:23 What type of algorithm does plane crazy use for drag on wings
creations-chat 2022-02-03 02:36:36 why the disconnector guns
creations-chat 2022-02-03 02:46:32 Zoom out some
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:02:05 Has that hars dude ever upvoted something

No relevance or anything
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:17:22 Theawesomegamer now would be a perfect time to shut up because you are making an ass of yourself
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:19:57 You are being very thin skinned about this and also creations feedback as i learned is where you do not argue 
And yeah they are right your builds are not the best, like the way you act here

Just shut up...
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:28:27 Get a life? Real funny you need to get originality  
No, I do not have to show you any builds because this is not about me

Again just quit talking already making a big problem out of it
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:33:17 No that is behind me now i am on the other end of the barrel
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:35:49 What
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:39:27 If you did not want to have anyone else join in then you should have done what the rules say and went somewhere else with your whining
And yes my builds are not good either but that does not matter

Then go damn
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:44:04 "Literally nobody cares about your opinion"
Please, practice what you preach. Yes, you finally see the light now go play beamng.drive
creations-chat 2022-02-03 03:46:06 2 reasons gotta have the last word and i enjoy jumping into arguments now go enjoy your game
creations-chat 2022-02-03 04:14:06 <@!717225155029631057> the gill-like wedges on the bottom of hull at front kind of look bad because it is a sign of sloppy building and not smooth

Maybe angle lock some paneling to cover it but you know that is only my view of it
creations-chat 2022-02-03 04:16:13 Ok that is good then
creations-chat 2022-02-03 04:25:26 You know next time one says they never asked inform them that they still got the answer  and to live with it anyways
creations-chat 2022-02-03 22:37:12 More than kinda probably based off of it
creations-chat 2022-02-04 02:55:56 
creations-chat 2022-02-04 02:59:46 Added doors and more detail also made the wings have angle lock 

<@!723940197456281640> U-41 ptakojester that nobody ever gives actual thoughts on
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:01:59 Not yet also yeah engines are fat it is what it is though

look closer it has them on the glass
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:04:35 last pic the cargo bay now please tell me some thoughts for the first time
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:06:51 Ok thank you
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:14:36 No because while it is not exactly the same this is the canon interior

<@!551806781609869313>
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:17:38 well the line of white is too high and the colors looked washed out

3 and 4 yes
creations-chat 2022-02-04 03:20:15 yes so 3 and 4
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:41:27 Wow, not 100% perfect but that is a given. I am jealous of that build  

So pretty much the trail thing on the window is not fully connected, the nose tip has those little gaps where a 4x triangle wedge *might* be motorlocked to and there are some strips of lighter color that don't look intentional because they are blocks.
Which is very minor stuff thatis a HOF build when done probably
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:50:25 How the engine now
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:52:28 well the wing is 2 blocks thick and the plane is 1.5 plots it is the only option

How does it look though
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:54:44 Yeah ofc
creations-chat 2022-02-05 15:58:05 half block as long as it can be centered and smooth, like you know angle locking the leading edge with half wedge down and stuff
creations-chat 2022-02-05 16:55:28 You can't upvote it either though...
creations-chat 2022-02-05 16:58:00 Surely at least once before
creations-chat 2022-02-05 17:02:53 look in hall of fame
creations-chat 2022-02-05 17:06:11 he does not upvote unless perfect but if you look at his creations channel it looks like the stuff he would typically downvote
creations-chat 2022-02-05 17:19:19 No no i meant his plan backfired not to upvote that
creations-chat 2022-02-05 17:23:19 
creations-chat 2022-02-05 22:49:53 Are those ribs because ribs are convex not like that
Pretty sure
creations-chat 2022-02-05 22:51:58 just make it pop out more
creations-chat 2022-02-05 22:55:10 At least it is great for demolition, pictoblox
creations-chat 2022-02-05 22:57:30 Now someone make a 767-200 for his wtc
creations-chat 2022-02-05 23:03:37 The camera lock one
creations-chat 2022-02-06 15:26:35 Dude that is great but maybe make the pitot thing trails, or smaller just looks out of place
creations-chat 2022-02-06 15:28:50 See how it looks like a frame for a balloon
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:20:20 Yeah except that one wedge on nose... Thanks though
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:23:33 Other people had them

And it is just  an ssr, the effect is very minimal and the reflections are from metal texture
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:27:07 Bro what, The shader is only doing very small things with the color and a tiny bit of ssr on the ground
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:32:11 Well see the rules say no external scripts to exploit, but shaders are not exploiting and 100k+ people use them 
maybe the screenshot is a mistake of rule interpretation by that moderator
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:34:50 "no external scripts *TO EXPLOIT*"      You are taking context away

Well if it does get banned that would be pretty unfair considering the use of them in the past
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:36:52 One guy has a heavily shaded build up since 7:00 am yesterday, pretty sure it is allowed
creations-chat 2022-02-06 18:57:26 Can i join a server you are in it would be faster than saying, bc i know exactly what it needs
creations-chat 2022-02-07 01:17:54 Basically she is the creator of some sort too
creations-chat 2022-02-07 01:21:11 Updated the exhaust part for the engines on this plane, how does it look https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/939948087424729130
creations-chat 2022-02-07 01:24:30 Whole thing

Its a super simple engine for large planes, only 246 blocks 5x5
creations-chat 2022-02-07 01:27:27 Yeah, by a half block so just used half wedges like intake things on some turbofans
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 03:01:32 Maybe tomorrow it is pretty bland rn and also i am going to sleep
creations-chat 2022-02-08 21:53:45 Are those smoke stacks supposed to be flat looking
creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:50:28 What is it
creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:53:45 looks like b-29 with a b24 glued on top and the color is not ideal

<@!393527373729103888> make the texture metal makes it darker and gives cool reflection
creations-chat 2022-02-09 01:55:49 Either a haze gray like most military, or a forest green. You can also stick with that tan because realism but make it darker and more distinct
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:01:41 And: Redo the entire prop, looks very blocky, motorlock some panels and wedges to make a smooth  flight deck, fix the glass ball on the very tip of nose, fix random black block on nose, Make all wings thicker and angle lock them from top and front view,  use better colors and better glass colors (darker),  hide exposed motor uinder wing, fix the sharp edges with motorlocked wedges there, The entire thing is out of scale (yes i know custom but still needs rescale), make bigger,  add the decals and junk, fix the general shape of the *everything to be more streamlined and curved, and smooth everything on top of that. That should be all

You do got potential though keep it up
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:07:57 no still kind of light actually
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:20:00 Hey guys this is a completely diff game but please use your plane crazy standards to judge this tank so far
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:24:36 It is build n destroy zero motorlock or need for it
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:27:05 It is what it is. I suspected he was joking, but I was also trying to recruit Build n Destroy players. It is a seriously underrated game with too small a player base.
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:31:38 75 slots, down to 0.0001 something stud resize, any degree of rotation, worse but tolerable pvp mechanics, potential for huge amount of detail, bigger plots, and a more dedicated group of players.
The only thing it lacks is plane crazy's simplicity and cleaner GUIs
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:34:00 Also take it easy though

All of you got a little hostile, it's not a big deal
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:39:45 Last pitch here is how to mainly build for anyone that may try it

<@!393527373729103888> The canopy looks a little odd, like oversized and doesn't sit well with the plane. Same for nose but less so
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:41:59 Yes but way more robust and precise minus the mesh tool, each main tool has a few sub-tools as well
Ok enough off channel messages now

It is better i promise it only takes  getting past that initial frustration
builds you though were simply too curved or complex are easy in the other game
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:49:57 Not my design avalanche studios design
creations-chat 2022-02-09 02:52:00 Yes, actually good job
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:40:02 See you are the type great at small detail and that does look good but you overlook medium level framework. For example the one block tail looks super bad imo. Also the whole thing looks out of proportion, especially from a side angle. 
Maybe angle lock the tail a tiny bit it just kind of sticks out
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:42:15 Don't build landing gear lol not worth it also you can always use your belly as a landing system- no moving parts
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:45:09 well looks over function here, if it looks good then function is not needed
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:26:37 Damn why do you need to be miserable to everyone instead of fixing the sails so they are good

Take it easy
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:29:24 Yeah the ship is decent but like you said the sails are wrong. they just don't look like sails they look like blocks
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:32:25 That is what we call "polishing shit." The sails do not look good, regardless of how they fold. Quit making excuses of why they suck and just fix them. They look far too bulky for one. The ship is pretty good though
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:35:34 It's only the sails bruh they suck, not the rest. Don't be all defensive just fix them
Yeah time and effort is not what we care about, it is the final product. for example an expert rank could build a great build in an hour that would take a newer player a week
creations-chat 2022-02-11 00:38:27 Side note nobody enjoys the company of one like you who appears to be angry about everything slinging around swears and whining about things that can be fixed
creations-chat 2022-02-11 02:48:20 Yes

Front or top view? make sure not to overlook that
creations-chat 2022-02-12 00:30:31 Maybe make the side nose windows  less square
creations-chat 2022-02-12 00:32:41 Well using some  locked pistons at very low settings, you can place tiny rounded corners on the glass blocks (with pretty much any opaque sloped block attached to the piston)
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:41:54 Someone has to do the manual vote reactions again
Some builds are in need of downvoting
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:44:08 It is though

Your job as a legal voter
help 2022-02-12 23:44:46 What is roscale
help 2022-02-12 23:47:42 Bro thought everyone already did that by default
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:50:40 Well despite effort we do not give out participation pity. Forget the personal side of this look at the build for what it is, good or bad and vote accordingly.
Getting downvoted as i can personally say is a great incentive to work harder and be perfect as possible.
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:56:08 No, this is a voting system on the quality of a fucking build. If their build is bad, downvote it
bot-central 2022-02-13 02:02:58 ?shelp
bot-central 2022-02-13 02:03:45 Damn
help 2022-02-13 02:11:55 Would a ballistic missile that is manned count as a rocket (It is propelled by one)
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:31:07 <@!551695227359068163> The wings have massive holes in them, landing gear is almost unrecognizable, whole build has a default color and lack of detail, the explosive blocks chilling under the wings, canopy looks like a playdough sculpture and the tail is far from 1:1

As in it looks like two sticks with paper wings
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:33:11 Yeah low standards and your "they had fun making it" attitude is not an excuse for lazy building
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:36:12 That does not make the build good. Take this as a chance to get better at the game and listen to feedback, not stamp your feet and whine about how much effort there was
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:39:46 Okay great, but you need to make your build fixed. it has a good starting point but plenty of problems. Feel free to take apart my builds especially the helicopter which sucks in hindsight

Can we see a side profile of this build
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:42:42 Well why does he not use his superior real aviation knowledge to build better
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:48:03 Perfect, the touch grass type line..

Well everyone here has a life too. Hardly any of us here play more than 4 hours per day and most of us are still in school. You can still make passable builds not playing all day. The bottom line here is that your build needs serious fixing and a repost
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:50:20 Ok it is in creations from a few days ago, probably the only decent build I have made so far

Dude suck it up though damn just fix your build/
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:53:07 Now he is checking our creations to see if we are qualified to give him votes probably
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:00:21 Bet he will metion the tail section of my plane, engine nacelle and the cargo bay if that is the subject of his criticism

Bruv i fixed the nose where you have WTF? marked
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:03:58 I fixed the wedge on front a few days ago lol https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/940435170069200976

also i used default engine because for one they move and two, because i did not have the room for 4 rotation locks on each engine with the shell already being locked for those intake parts
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:06:03 Bruv only fan of the engine  is default
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:08:07 Most of you wrote though could be said about your build but 10x more so
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:10:40 This dude has a real pretentious attitude about aeronautical engineering and shows knowledge that most players in pcc would know

Also that is not an excuse for a disgusting build. If you thought it was bad why post it

creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:28:42 <@!551695227359068163> At least your build competes with the texas highway a-10...
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:31:57 You whined when told it was bad though...
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:35:14 Your score is negative, double or triple the upvotes now probably
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:37:16 There you go, back into the shell of delusions ("There was effort"  "the build was fun to make" "at least someone liked it")
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:39:23 Okay yes now fix the build we have given plenty of feedback
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:42:05 Dont forget the massive gaping lines in the wings
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:44:08 No, it takes TWO motors to fix that even with custom surfaces. Super easy and common solution
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:46:56 that is all it takes

Great, no more excuses of why you cant make common level builds, right?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:52:18 Well almost the same thing instead you cover the gaps on top with some disconnecters  or wing panel
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:41:53 That m1a2 sure has a small body

<@!698587744842022983>  just looks a little plain because all white, and the front wings merging with elevators doesn't make much sense
creations-chat 2022-02-13 23:46:58 Yeah but the ones on that jet just look like spikes or hills  more than wings
creations-chat 2022-02-13 23:49:00 But not that bad it's probably just the paint. at least having a distinct leading edge would make it way better

Yeah would look really cool with good texturing

Can we see standard lighting bruv
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:18:59 I can read, he will be back eventually dumbass
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:21:01 So he will see it when he returns, what is going through your minds? Nobody demanded or expected an instant reply

Do you have zero foresight
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:27:04 That makes zero sense from a hardware perspective you can always turn them off
Why are there blocky trapdoors on your elevators and what is that perfect tiny cylinder on the nose and rudder
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:43:05 How does that show stupidity? He returned and sort of evaded the request, but still replied.
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:48:04 How and when, elaborate.  You are def correct if you mean the arguments shortly after joining


So what if he is on vacation? I pinged, he replied. What part of that do you not goddamn understand? I was not expecting a response soon, just one *eventually.* You are the one showing incompetent messaging. Just stfu already and quit clinging to the vacation line it is completely inert here
creations-chat 2022-02-19 18:54:21 Pinging does not mean looking for an instant response. it means requesting the user's attention, whenever they decide to read it or reply. As for the vacation, for the 3rd time i was asking for him to possibly provide a non-rtx type image whenever he feels like it, not instantly.  This conversation is over, shut your non-bitch having ass up you get no replies anymore

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:58:49 pvp or no
general 2022-03-06 20:30:09 Build n destroy better now go play it instead
general 2022-03-06 20:30:35 Chill out
general 2022-03-06 20:36:49 Good for you, hwoever that doesn't change that plane crazy is far more limiting and infested
general 2022-03-06 20:37:31 That's pretty much all it has going along with more players and easier pvp
general 2022-03-06 20:38:35 Great excuse for bad builds though
general 2022-03-06 20:38:49 That is wrong
general 2022-03-06 20:39:06 you can make great exceptional builds if you actually put effort in
general 2022-03-06 20:39:15 and you know better than studio if you can't code
general 2022-03-06 20:39:26 Bro what
general 2022-03-06 20:39:30 that is far too common
general 2022-03-06 20:39:33 more than mechs
general 2022-03-06 20:39:36 too
general 2022-03-06 20:39:42 WAY more than mechs bro

general 2022-03-06 20:40:09 fine rotation
general 2022-03-06 20:40:31 You must have played way back a few years ago
general 2022-03-06 20:40:55 it's actually hard to find low effort build there now because everyone is super dedicated that i have met
general 2022-03-06 20:41:19 It's practically the same thing, stop nostalgia bias
general 2022-03-06 20:42:04 How much have you actually played lol
general 2022-03-06 20:42:17 How much
general 2022-03-06 20:42:55 The things you have said are mostly wrong and... irrational hatred of shoulder joints too
general 2022-03-06 20:43:07 ok, it is 2022 now

general 2022-03-06 20:44:22 same can be said about PC
general 2022-03-06 20:44:33 all it takes is knowledge of common skills
general 2022-03-06 20:44:40 in PC
general 2022-03-06 20:44:51 Well again sounds like just a skill issue on your part
general 2022-03-06 20:45:19 You don't HAVE to do that
general 2022-03-06 20:45:32 ok yeah that does suck
general 2022-03-06 20:46:09 but the mechanics are still better, just not for wing parts and lift
general 2022-03-06 20:46:54 because with tanks in bnd you don't need 3 block wide barrels to have actual projectiles and weapons
general 2022-03-06 20:48:52 In the end they do the same thing: kill and destroy. BnD does it better because plane crazy premade wepaons are mostly innate and as for spikes build armor bruv and use plating
general 2022-03-06 20:49:05 you are looking at bnd in a far simpler light than what is possible
general 2022-03-22 23:14:11 Watch the birds fly
creations-chat 2022-04-03 17:26:47 Yeah but there are 6 seats so not all of them reliably eject all the time which takes away from it
creations-chat 2022-04-03 17:37:54 Is there a problem with having an ejection seat even if it very common
creations-chat 2022-04-03 17:39:56 Ok we will die with the aircraft
Very patriotic

Also sorry for jumping to a conclusion then
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:08:33 Yes but I'm not going to fool with the build anymore
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:54:04 the canopy looks super strange maybe pull the 2x wing panels down a half block
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:58:08 piston count ?
general 2022-04-03 19:11:59 Check this comparison website out 
https://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/compare-aircraft.php
creations-chat 2022-04-03 19:16:54 Yeah because the other canopy looked more like a slightly swept line
creations-chat 2022-04-03 19:21:53 Looks pretty fast
general 2022-04-03 19:48:40 It's actually pretty cool
creations-chat 2022-04-05 22:55:21 add more curves and make sure to look at it from top, front, sides diagonal and closely compare
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:24:22 Why is the canopy this small, the angles look pretty cool but it's too narrow
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:26:35 Messing up motorlock does not give this design flaw. You didn't state obviously that the motor lock mistake made the canopy too narrow. Also why would you post it if you screwed up? what are you trying to get out of the pcc? don't post something can be fixed easily just fix it
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:28:55 The wording and picture looks very serious like you need feedback or help aka it's not funny if you have to explain that is a joke
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:31:14 Nobody is mad
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:33:57 You have to be honest and forward with posters in such a large server so they will learn from their mistakes and make better things
Ok though who saw the post and realized it was a joke before being told so
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:36:09 Then fix it, nothing is funny about messing a build up. That kind of mistake is daily here
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:38:28 I'm not mad, I am just telling you that 
A. Your joke does not look like a joke 
B. Fix the build instead of making excuses
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:40:38 You have said that. But it isn't funny to anyone here so far  
just take it easy
Ok this has gone on for enough time in circles
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:47:06 All i really said was how the canopy didn't look right and that their joke was not worded as a joke
<#504436696021204992>  stop getting so upset about meaningless conversations
You are right they tend to insult the creator over skill issues
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:55:21 As a general thing for the server, maybe we would all be happier if we

Didn't take insults and honest feedback as hits to the very soul 

Didn't get fucked up over opinions about your *plane crazy build*

Realized we are all in the same server and didn't stand off to each other daily

Did not make excuses and instead work on the problem 

Took it easy 

Maybe go outside a few hours a day or at least played a different game for once

Take this game for what it is, a game and not your career
creations-chat 2022-04-06 22:58:37 Yes
I couldnt have said it better
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:01:49 How is it a ratio you posted back in january didnt reply to his and have about the same score?
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:04:22 Ratio is when you post something as a reply and it gets more popular
And does it really matter they're about the same level
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:08:54 Dude it's all good builds can be fixed remember just post the newer one
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:11:53 You can go to blender and use the voxel or decimate  modifier,
 you can look at  decent simpleplanes versions, 
you can compare your progress with the actual thing from every angle,
 you can import it into roblox studio and scale it then build from that 
there are many ways but probably tedious
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:14:14 Wait i think it's called the voxel remesh modifier actually
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:22:53 Yeah it was made for a good amount of time ago in a smaller server
Pretty low score
creations-chat 2022-04-08 23:42:09 Could one claim an airship as a vtol for the rank

creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:11:22 Yeah it's not too bad though
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:25:44 How does it look so far
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:27:32 Supposed to be
But i haven't added the huge circle things on the bottom so it is pretty top heavy right now
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:29:16 I'm not trying to have a diamond shaped airship
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:33:39 it would still be diamond shaped doing this is the only way to get a smooth and correctly shaped envelope
creations-chat 2022-04-09 16:35:51 That's why you post in this channel

Fix the wings to a constant angle and fix the sweep to be one smooth triangle.
add curves pretty much everywhere, especially the back of the body and the side.
Motorlock wing panels to cover your control surfaces or make custom 'hidden' control surfaces so that the wings are seamless.
choose a less disgusting color
add detail with some references and motorlock
use camera lock to fix the angle that runs from the canopy to the rudder
Make your own gear
make the canopy longer and add more depth around that area
Make some intakes to cover the rockets there
and fix the nose
creations-chat 2022-04-10 21:16:24 Not trying to be hostile, but it would be best for you to remake it more proportionally and more closely reference so yeah probably just delete and remake
And if you're stuck or confused someone will def help so dont give up on it
help 2022-04-10 21:25:27 Its just now getting to production and clearmotion has bought the idea

creations-chat 2022-04-10 21:30:35 Here is the basic idea of a swept wing <@845396941373833226>
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:17:15 Motorlock the guns to be hidden (and rockets) and set the glass to regular. Then use 2 blue trails and angle lock them so that you have your quill
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:19:41 Then learn
If you saw that a door of making greater builds was open, why not walk through it
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:22:57 Tell the incompatibility to fuck itself then learn
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:26:41 Pay for a laggy remote desktop in your browser then download roblox and camera lock in  831 ping
Breach roblox's data storage, steal plane crazy, then fix 
use a motor far away from a camera and pretend camera lock works
possible but no fun
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:28:52 Why is the command part stacked in layers

creations-chat 2022-04-11 22:38:30 Too specific of a thing anyways with the gun. It's like those obscure rejected guinness applications
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:48:37 "This build is old"  "unfinished" or a full on status intel report on everything the build can do
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:50:24 Damn he leaves

help 2022-04-19 04:15:19 Why are players placing trap doors on top of wings?
help 2022-04-19 04:15:33 what the hell is the point it looks terrible
help 2022-04-19 04:18:25 Why do they not bother to angle lock the leading edge to not be blocky if they do decide to add those
help 2022-04-19 04:18:34 there is literally a compormise for pvp and looks
help 2022-04-19 04:18:44 but nobody has bothered looks like
help 2022-04-19 04:19:45 Well see they have the leading edge of the wing blocky and don't angle lock the trapdoors to be a s,ooth wing
bot-central 2022-04-19 15:40:45 Damn bot

creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:21:32 the joints and color is <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
But still better than average biological build
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:23:15 at least they have a few things right if you can look past the holes in the joints
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:25:00 but you have things like the prop engine on the outside of the tail which really takes away

Like dude put htem inside of the tail i t is def fat enough
creations-chat 2022-04-19 16:26:49 actually with those holes and this is not a joke you could make a really sick skeleton type build from it

creations-chat 2022-04-20 14:42:52 Does nobody use snip and sketch for screenshots

creations-chat 2022-04-20 14:44:34 üëå  wonder if its the  same guy who made that one A10...
general 2022-04-20 15:05:30 add some more detail and shit... Looks sick already

help 2022-04-20 16:23:54 Wonder what the devs were going for with this one
help 2022-04-20 16:32:01 It looks like a mark 77 and a fuel tank mixed together
creations-chat 2022-04-20 19:01:36 Why are there rocket engines on the top of wings and why are the wings thin
And what is the wing thing on top of hte body
creations-chat 2022-04-20 19:03:19 but keep it up bc would be decent if you would fix all the problems that specifically all the wings have
creations-chat 2022-04-20 19:07:04 yeah just fix the wings elevators and stuff mainly
creations-chat 2022-04-20 19:27:41 Bro take it easy

creations-chat 2022-04-21 02:54:51 Not done but how does it look so far
Also plan on making one with the rebel sky camo paint
creations-chat 2022-04-21 02:56:32 Its worth it having two motors stick out than having blocky camo on the ailerons and a big hole in the wings
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:03:23 make the camo smooth
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:06:05 Seriously though other than a couple exposed motors is there anything in need of attention here
creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:08:54 well actually its a fairly smooth bubble

creations-chat 2022-04-21 03:45:18 It is what it is i was just looking at the creations and noticed they had them missing
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:32:54 
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:34:48 Also changed a few tiny things, what you guys think so far

And yeah thanks <@568688233760686081>  should have seen that
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:37:53 i am planning on making a rebel blue version as it is a wip rn
when i finish the base model
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:49:40 Ok one last question do you guys think it would be better to have working ailerons and keep the 2 exposed motors or just make it wing surface and have no exposed lock
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:51:52 Ah but what would be cooler
creations-chat 2022-04-21 04:57:08 No the exposed lock that is farther outwards can not be moved because it would stop the ailerons from pivoting 
the more inwards pair cant be moved either because the wings are camera locked and it would make a big welded mess
so its jsut one or the other
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:00:54 All in a days shit build spree
Only a handful of interesting builds since november
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:02:50 And it looks and functions better lmao
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:04:59 Just take it easy man and use this thoughts to make a better build
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:06:41 RBK and purifiedwater still havent added reactions to the bad builds so we can downvote
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:08:22 Damn thats pretty nice
creations-chat 2022-04-21 06:10:20 Anyone got some good sky camo rgb codes that look good in plane crazy

creations-chat 2022-04-23 19:11:54 Hey fleetofretribution give some feedback
creations-chat 2022-04-23 19:14:53 Well alright gonna add some details to the brown one then
creations-chat 2022-04-23 19:16:49 Bruh ill try but this is the in game colors
creations-chat 2022-04-23 19:20:37 Ok thanks for feedback though

And ok magnetic this is the concept also on sloped/non wing blocks you just motorlock a wedge or wing panel to the correct angle
general 2022-04-23 19:33:30 Ok
general 2022-04-23 19:37:10 https://streamable.com/k3bugc Epic view today at least 30 planes have come in and out
creations-chat 2022-04-23 23:25:55 what else would it be
creations-chat 2022-04-24 13:46:30 It‚Äôs a light there‚Äôs a red one too and another pair on the intakes
creations-chat 2022-04-24 15:21:06 Never use default colors ü§¢
creations-chat 2022-04-24 21:52:28 Has anyone ever done the motorlock with no tower or cameras thing
creations-chat 2022-04-24 21:54:35 No, i didnt see anything about this before. Someone has probably done this before anyways but here is a method to motorlock/angle lock/piston lock etc. any amount of blocks and then remove the motors (it's not camera or piston lock.) This is obviously useful for so much more than used in these videos. the only downside is that it is difficult to do correctly and you have to have at least 2 blocks in the independent part. Here is some videos of the method being used on a simple bomb and simple landing gear as well as a bomb with angle lock. If by small chance i was the only one to discover this, tell me and i'll make a tutorial on how to do this.

https://streamable.com/8fjrja
creations-chat 2022-04-24 21:56:36 Ok basically motorlock with no brim (not cameras or pistons or any glitches) with fully intended features
creations-chat 2022-04-24 21:58:24 I used a more advanced version to make some impossibly smooth curved parts on some of my builds
creations-chat 2022-04-24 22:01:35 soooo has anyone done that before
creations-chat 2022-04-24 22:03:26 Bruh anyone yes or no has this been discovered yet
creations-chat 2022-04-24 22:05:36 Be specific here, has the method to completely remove the motor/camera lock from parts yet keep them locked together independent of the build been found
creations-chat 2022-04-24 22:07:37 If so why is it not used every time someone motorlocks to get rid of exposed lock
creations-chat 2022-04-25 22:19:21 Anyone made a good icbm 
Seems like it would be nice
creations-chat 2022-04-25 22:31:27 I personally would spin lock a bunch of trapdoors (keeping the motor free of the hatch‚Äôs opening) or possibly just piston lock a few cylinders
creations-chat 2022-04-25 22:33:13 Alright you can make a single trapdoor and spin lock a hollow cylinder shape on top
creations-chat 2022-05-01 20:58:43 Thoughts so far on this base model b-17 
I will fix the exposed lock soon
creations-chat 2022-05-01 21:00:44 diff angle
creations-chat 2022-05-01 21:02:29 Yeah i just made the wings and engine
creations-chat 2022-05-01 21:25:29 So its just the wings that are really bad?
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:39:05 Made some of the changes suggested how is it now
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:40:51 other than that have not finished yet that will be taken care of
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:42:44 What
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:51:06 Ok like i said i know about the exposed lock and unpainted parts
creations-chat 2022-05-01 22:56:29 Yes
creations-chat 2022-05-02 01:25:40 Still not through but how does it look now
And yes i know about the exposed lock on the wings and will fix that eventually somehow
creations-chat 2022-05-02 01:28:23 Can i ever get feedback about anything other than the wings. Yes they suck but how is the rest
creations-chat 2022-05-02 01:32:10 no not enough room inside
creations-chat 2022-05-02 01:34:16 Yes
creations-chat 2022-05-02 20:45:55 Some more changes
Almost done just gotta add more details and fix the exposed locks
creations-chat 2022-05-02 20:48:13 maybe round that canopy out more
creations-chat 2022-05-02 20:50:57 just break it down to more angles
3 angles is a little too poly
creations-chat 2022-05-02 20:59:27 make it a little bigger
Roscale doesn't really matter and as long as it looks good that is good
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:01:09 Not if it was smoother, expand in all directions
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:04:00 No they aren't if you scale it up right. Sure, blocky tutorial f-35 sucks but you can't notice a thing if it is proportional
also it should be 3 block wide near the back of the canopy with a smooth cone nose from a pyramid
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:06:03 Plenty actually just give me a minute to find some
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:11:39 i cant find any right away but here is how you make a 3 block nose look good, you do the typical pyramid, half wedge 1x2, then a custom half wedge 1x4 that transitions to the actual 3 blocks. No  one is any wiser.

It also give a round canopy in every dimension and gets rid of the trash transition from 1x2 half wedge down to half wedge
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:16:59 they probably do better on a regular basis. It is good to try your best but bad to not realize when your head is getting too big
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:19:07 Just make it rounder
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:23:12 That's like saying "i refuse to practice aiming because it takes more complicated stances to get right" then coming here and getting shot 

Also yeah your build is trash in todays terms would have been divine about the time rickje took over
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:24:55 Great, you just forgot good color shape and proportion, the 3 most vital things in a build 
looks like something from the Atari/SNES bro
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:29:22 Minecraft pfp too?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 14:39:16 Damn why is everyone always leaving in a tantrum spouting off nonsense that the community isnt fair
creations-chat 2022-05-03 14:48:52 Exhibit number unknown
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:22:15 Getting pretty close to finishing probably 85% done
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:23:59 That is the base of a disconnector that i forgot to take out, pretty much it helps me angle lock
Can be removed
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:25:57 no it like holds a trail thing in place and helps angle lock down to the pixels, but it can be moved somewhere else
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:27:52 Front angle
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:46:50 Build n destroy ??

Why are there servos on the wing
creations-chat 2022-05-03 23:54:04 See because water
creations-chat 2022-05-04 00:09:13 Good ol build n destroy which only really suffers from bugs and lack of players
It's like rtx compared to plane crazy
https://streamable.com/idjyn3 compared to my plane crazy version is no contest even if it is not done
creations-chat 2022-05-04 00:14:45 No but that doesn't really matter you can just build them manually and make a pretty complex flying system with physics blocks and thrusters
creations-chat 2022-05-04 00:17:04 Well it depends on what you value skill level and attention to detail, the game is pretty broken too
creations-chat 2022-05-05 03:40:38 üëå  Will look very sick when colored
creations-chat 2022-05-05 03:42:44 You guys think this b17 would look better as the aluminum grey version (would look something like this) https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/971614051606102056
creations-chat 2022-05-05 03:50:53 Looks like it
creations-chat 2022-05-05 04:00:58 what? they are angled in every direction
creations-chat 2022-05-05 04:03:36 Ah yes this one is very promising

And honestly for thin tips is it what it is i have a 2 block width at the base and 1 at the tip which is enough for me
<@410455661814480896>
creations-chat 2022-05-05 04:05:21 Well thanks
creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:25:25 Yeah I‚Äôm done with it though thanks for feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:29:12 So pretty much not going to fix or anything
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:30:05 Do you need help getting out, you should call 911 first
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:09:03 Looks about fine, don't fix if it isn't broken
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:11:05 Oh well it looks alright to me so i don't really care
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:12:53 Ok  then looking at your creations you suck pretty bad yourself and you beg for downvotes (a sign of self consciousness)
Also 1 block wide jets bruh moment
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:16:19 True but some people especially around our assumed area really do say that often from dialect and stuff

Common to replace "you guys" which sounds gay af and yall is just quicker to say
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:19:05 Lack of detail, overtoned color, too many wheels it looks like, the wheels are pretty low effort, no tracks, literally a tumor in the barrel, the sight is too big and blocky, add more colors, weird ass flag  and you tried to add detail at the back but you can only think in one block proportions
And damn how arrogant of you to assume this looks good and put it out there

Overall suck
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:20:47 This belongs in an Atari game dude
Trust me it sucks ilostacctwice
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:22:51 Ok, if you knew or thought it was old or  had less quality WHY would you post it in hopes of falsifying the claim that you are bad. You said i suck which is true but you are def ass too. So we suck together don't try to deny it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:24:44 That's like the dumbest excuse ever we see all the time "this build is old" instant downvote
and no you can just use the search bar but not my oldest build though i hate it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:29:52 True if you are going to sin and have a cringe pfp at least make it hot
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:49:47 Here is what your tank looks like thrown on top of ground.. like i said fix the colors and detail and more importantly proportion if you are going to show it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 01:53:48 11 wheels bruh
creations-chat 2022-05-06 02:20:27 You can just say ass bro you are allowed
creations-chat 2022-05-06 02:25:33 yeah roblox graphics ass so glass removes textures and like overlay type graphics

Cool if only it would save though
creations-chat 2022-05-06 02:41:16 Side note bro but nobody in the south talks like that üíÄ 
 you sound like an Oregon resident trying to do a 1930 racist stereotypical black talk that they did in old cartoons
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:30:01 Plane crazy 2 will have cooler and more effective weapons right? Something better than a slow jet wars missile and a broken gun, such as a cannon. Or are they just going to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:32:06 This dude sure loves to claim builds are old. Probably just made it and knows it‚Äôs eh. Instant downvote for excuses on bad builds if it sucks dont post
creations-chat 2022-05-06 21:46:23 Interesting, if only we didn't see this same fight every day
creations-chat 2022-05-06 21:48:12 Because you're in a server full of wannabe aeronautical engineer roblox playing teenagers and children who just can't let someone else be right
And they all want the last word
creations-chat 2022-05-06 21:56:36 Moderators this is partially your fault for not being stricter about arguments in this channel
creations-chat 2022-05-06 21:59:16 Yeah mostly our fault

bot-central 2022-05-07 00:01:51 Get rank
bot-central 2022-05-07 00:02:19 Just do a aeronautical engineer lv 1
bot-central 2022-05-07 00:03:53 Wasn't talking to anyone
bot-central 2022-05-07 00:04:09 We never had this conversation
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:33:26 Super tedious magnet locking
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:36:20 i dont think many have learned  it yet because there is no tutorial but its pretty much a way to motorlock and then remove the motors but keep the lock
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:38:24 what no its motorlocking but you get remove the motorlock and it still stays together because it is welded by magnets
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:40:27 maybe later i left the game and i dont want to go back and relock and fold all that 
Just zoom in or something because it takes forever to spawn in
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:42:48 Pretty much the entire build is heavily angled and piston locks and i know the shape sucks but its about as close as i could get it to this. Its a little longer too but you know it is what it is
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:45:20 what makes the shape bad, its literally about as close as humanly possible to the actual u7 dravec with the exception of it being a little longer and not as bright
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:51:59 No i have no idea what you're talking about 

And please, where is the shape wrong! the only thing i can see is the wings are slightly different and the cockpit is shorter
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:54:15 Bruh it isn't

And no i got some classified smoothing secrets on the nose and canopy
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:57:05 Well yeah i thought the actual u7 looks badass but i guess not to you guys so ill ask next time i go to make something
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:59:08 well damn the sclaing looks fine to me guess thats why you post here first instead of creations
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:02:25 Ok

<@718409831639154718>  There is plenty of image quality to fucking zoom in dont be lazy
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:04:40 the canopy is cylinder on the glass part with some magnet+angle locked trails that make dividers, each divider is actually 2 layers of trails piston locked to be touching

And wtf does roblox model mean
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:06:42 i told you its magnet locking. i posted some videos a while back about it  and explained it a little

It can be used for very small precise parts but is  a little unreliable and doesn't work every single time

Yeah zachman
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:12:46 click the link
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:34:01 Why do you think my build is a "roblox model" then

dude it's not even that good what could possibly be the impossible part
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:38:15 Are you fucking serious why would i need to prove that the jet is real 

But sure i just can't join right now ill ping you in under an hour when i can

GOt some shovel work to do ill be back in a sec
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:26:28 Guys chill the fuck down the jet isn't even that good just motor/piston/camera/magnet spam
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:28:29 Hell no that takes too long and i dont have to prove this shit everything i have shown is possible and  can readily be explained. WHAT PART OF THIS JET DO YOU THINK IS A 3D model damn
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:31:29 since the wings are double layered, (black on bottom) a regular delta wing can be angled diagonally to be clipped inside of the double layers
Makes it look really small
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:33:32 Yes

And i got 20 minutes to burn so ask anything
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:35:41 No i didn't you asked can i explain all of it
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:37:18 Its just the yellow parts angled
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:37:38 and a few of them had to be magnet locked
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:38:55 Ok correction guys i have 4 minutes to burn
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:39:18 thats a trail
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:41:27 Its a u7 dravec... like a said many times not a mig-29
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:44:05 yeah the cockpit bugs me because i couldn't make it 1 block bigger so it had to be a little small and short
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:46:10 Alright bye have to go its been my 5 minutes. there is no reason anybody should have questions if you guys would read the whole conversation everything was explained
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:48:40 i explained that earlier, jsut read the whole convo before you speak and doubt. and no i shouldn't have to spawn anything in like i said everything was explained
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:27:18 You removed my fucking build? i proved very much so that my build was real and you grasped at imaginary straws and "found evidence" it is a "studio creation." Really if you guys are going to be like that then just forget this server, later.
