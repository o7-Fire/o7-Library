general 2022-05-31 18:02:01 flares that don't work
general 2022-05-31 18:02:29 I wonder if there could be flares added to pc
general 2022-05-31 18:02:44 makes rockets explode early

general 2022-06-02 15:38:02 bombs
general 2022-06-02 15:39:21 no way trapdoors actually work
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 18:37:33 cool f18 I made
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 18:38:25 and yes those are water propellers used for the engine inlets
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:29:18 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:29:21 f18
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:30:30 how are you upset at an f18 when your pfp is a gif from top gun 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:31:12 you're thinking of the super hornet?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:31:43 I literally have no idea how to angle lock shut up
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:33:36 you expect me to caculate the dimensions of the actual plane?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 00:34:46 aight I'ma leave and come back like 5 hours later
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 03:07:38 that's how prototypes are made
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 03:09:40 anyways how do I angle lock without making it looky crappy
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 03:10:52 I'm not even sure what you made
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 03:11:24 looks cool but I feel like I'm seeing 4 aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 03:12:24 I see bits of an A-10, an F14 and f4 phantom

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:17:20 just use unprimed explosive blocks on your builds so their cutters won't work
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:23:29 can camera lock be used for swashplates
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:25:05 these kids skipped art class
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:31:54 motor locked trapdoors could work if the bomb bay is narrow enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:33:02 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:34:50 vey funi
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:36:15 it's just a transistor's worth of data storage

general 2022-06-04 00:00:37 rockets are slow and barely hit anything that isn't a ground target, I would rather have a bigger and faster missle that requires target lock and has a much higher regen cooldown

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 00:01:40 but it's a bit too detailed, I can't comprehend how someone would go about doing that
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 00:08:23 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 00:08:32 I understand, although somewhat vaugely
general 2022-06-08 00:13:34 bruh I've seen a bit too many tanks with the generic wheels
