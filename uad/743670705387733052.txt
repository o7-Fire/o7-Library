creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:10:32 Any feedback or things i can improve on my Iowa class so far
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:12:38 ok, i looked it up and the turrets are a lighter shade of gray so that should add some variation
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:14:57 oh alright, i might try the measure 32 camo later when i finish the ship (i think its called measure 32 right?)

creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:38:13 ik the color is bland rn but how does the actual build look, also its missing all secondary guns and smaller details because its still a wip
general 2021-12-04 18:41:20 yo how do you get color ranks
general 2021-12-04 18:41:42 oh ok
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:41:58 the antenna parts or the actual tower itself
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:44:05 do you think moving the bridge up 1 or 2 blocks would help it look better, i think i did build the bride too low because from the front you can even see it behind the turrets
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:46:15 barbettes?? sorry im not really that good with ship stuff
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:48:28 ah alright, so i should move the turret down 1 block?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:50:54 ok thanks, should i do anything to the conning tower or would i be better off just leaving it be
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:59:12 <@!527653676022628353> are the barbettes better now? i lowered the front one by half a block and the back one by 1 block
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:01:21 how much do you think i need to raise the conning tower, or does it look good now since i lowered the turrets
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:03:24 alright thanks for the help
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:11:06 i mean the real ships turrets are kinda flat, <@!580743934171676672> iowa class
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:14:57 theyre 3 blocks tall already 🗿
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:17:01 if i make them four they would be too fat though, wouldnt they?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 19:19:05 well shoot maybe if i made them 20 id be good 🧠

creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:01:43 rotund means fat and round, also why are the barrels so short??
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:04:13 i mean they seem kinda fat to me and the barrels look way too short

creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:09:51 last time i checked turrets that are 4 blocks tall and  almost as tall as your superstructure doesnt mean sleek, it means im about to vomit 🤮 your entire superstructure is practically a box, i say delete the whole thing and start over
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:12:10 9.7k blocks wtf????? what did you do fill the interior full of blocks?? and if this is your best build i dont want to even imagine what your worst build looks like 😳
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:15:11 then fix the back if you changed the type of ship halfway through your build <:tarded:831359068387016727>

creations-chat 2022-02-25 01:56:36 thanks, i plan on adding windows to the sides eventually with text so i think that might break up the color on the hull and add a little variation (if not i can probably try adding different shades of gray)

plane-crazy 2022-07-28 03:48:26 yeah i still need to add detail to the rear deck
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 03:48:38 i have anchor chains and ballards on the front
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 03:48:50 and the things that reel in the anchor chains, no idea what they're called
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 03:50:59 yeah those things
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 04:06:25 what battleship is it
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 04:06:26 or is it custom
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 04:08:51 doesnt look bad but id extend the red to go out under the gray, also i agree with <@163143541160148992> that seems like itd be a lot for the length of the ship

plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:09:34 you spent 8 hours on that???
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:09:38 also can you send a pic of it spawned in
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:10:46 hm
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:10:50 can you send a pic of the build spawned in
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:13:13 why are the sides locked, that seems kind of unnecessary to me unless im missing something
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:14:45 wdym helps you out when painting, also you can motorlock the pitot tube in the front a lot easier if you just extend some cams straight out from the tower and put trails on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:16:49 do the pitot tube on the nose like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:16:54 that way you dont have to motorlock the sides of the nose
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:17:12 i think it is?
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:17:54 idk what else it would be
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:18:02 what
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:18:15 pitot tube
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:18:19 it measures the air speed of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:18:24 its the pointy tube on the end of a jets nose
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:18:39 
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:19:05 thats a pitot tube
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:19:11 i imagine thats what hes trying to replicate
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 23:20:32 i also used my family pc up until 2 years ago

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:40:41 false information
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:41:18 guys how can i make 5 inch naval gun shells, im trying to put an interior on my battleship
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:41:48 they look like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:42:15 kinda hard inside a ship interior
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:42:37 with not much room
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:43:22 could you try and explain
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:45:29 what could i put in the rear part of the ship, steering gear for the rudders maybe?
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:46:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:46:08 i have 2 floors inside of the ship
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:46:39 i would put an engine room in the ship but the red part of the hull just isnt tall enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:48:11 heres a layout of the first floor
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:48:18 and then the second
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:48:34 im working on a full interior ship, its based off of the uss atlanta
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:49:08 few pics of the outside of the hull
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:49:23 light cruiser
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:50:00 are you trying to do roscale or what
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:50:37 thats just the ERA right?
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:50:54 i think that looks good
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:51:10 it might be a bit bigger than roscale but it doesnt look too big
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 01:51:17 wdym

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:37:12 well close to full interior
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:37:42 almost full interior because i cant really fit much in the bow and not a whole lot of room in the stern either for stuff
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:37:43 its got 2 floors
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:38:28 this is a pic of the finished ship but im rebuilding it with an interior

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:42:58 im not too keen on the insides of ships
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:43:12 alr

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:43:38 💀 💀 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:43:39 the hull was so garbage
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:43:46 i got flamed for that one
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:43:58 yeah thats an old build
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:06 it looks nothing like the missouri
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:12 yeah i never finished it
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:43 real
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:45 same
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:50 bro wanna see my first non tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:44:53 back from december 2020
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:03 i didnt even know how to motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:26 
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:27 no motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:29 no wheels
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:33 uss atlanta
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:45:54 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:46:01 that was the first build i ever did on my own
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:46:18 thx lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:46:27 that one hardly flew
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:46:48 its unsmooth
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:46:59 yup
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:47:15 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:47:26 i would put an engine room but sadly the red part of my ship isnt tall enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:48:04 the red part?
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:48:38 this is the tallest the red gets
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:48:49 and i still need somewhere to put helium, ballast, and engines so this thing can move
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:48:53 so im just leaving the red empty
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:49:06 unless the engine room extends up above the waterlin then
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:49:18 it would be in that part, not sure if it extends above waterline or not
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:49:56 im kind of just winging the interior and building whatever, not really using floorplans and such
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:50:49 samew
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:50:58 jesse
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:51:25 the ship im making is based mainly off of the uss atlanta
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:51:30 its not a complete replica of it
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:51:45 i added some different features like a helipad on the rear deck like the uss missouri had
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:02 yeah i used that for deck details
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:04 the war thunder one
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:36 the ship i posted earlier
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:40 which is this without the interior
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:46 has a few differences from atlanta
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:50 such as it only has 2 rear turrets
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:52:55 and a helipad on the rear deck
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:53:08 the one im making with interior i might try and make it exact to the atlanta
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:53:17 because i dont imagine people would like a custom ship in creations would they
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:53:52 this
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:12 i think its uh
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:13 foredeck
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:16 or bow
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:30 ive made a few
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:40 counting this ive made 3
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:43 the other 2 i never finished
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:45 nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:49 i just want to get a rank with this
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:54:56 so i dont have to be a whitename anymore
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:17 uh which one
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:19 no interior
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:22 or interior
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:39 so far all i have is the hull and its over 5k so
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:50 
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:55:53 nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:56:15 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:56:21 that shouldnt be too hard hopefully

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:56:35 alr
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:57:03 i was thinking when i post the ship since it has an interior, save a copy of it and split that copy down the center
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:57:06 like a cross section pic
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 02:57:20 sort of like this

plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:01:47 ok aero engineer II
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:02:02 in build mode?
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:02:15 i did them kinda weird but sure
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:02:22 nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:03:19 <@883063424614006878> i made them big squares and angled them in, probably why they look like garbage when spawned
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:03:20 let me get a pic of them spawned
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:04 they arent nearly wide enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:16 and my wing sticks through a tiny bit on the side
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:18 so those need redone
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:21 just dont feel like it rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:43 i built this before i discovered piston lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:49 strue
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:04:50 true
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:08:22 so i used the piston lock but it kinda screwed everything up
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:08:23 so
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:08:39 for it to work i prob need to redo the area
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:09:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:09:25 i do like the gear on this though
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:09:32 has working doors and everything
plane-crazy 2022-07-30 03:09:49 and roblox broke my copy and paste again

help 2022-08-18 01:54:47 show me where you're trying to fold it
help 2022-08-18 01:59:32 ok well theres a bit of a problem here
help 2022-08-18 01:59:44 not sure why you put the middle on top instead of directly beside the front piece
help 2022-08-18 02:00:12 normally when building ships you want to put the 1st and 2nd fold directly next to eachother
help 2022-08-18 02:00:46 you're gonna need to move those cams and motors to the very end of the front fold
help 2022-08-18 02:01:00 so put them on that very last block
help 2022-08-18 02:02:45 yes
help 2022-08-18 02:03:12 hmm
help 2022-08-18 02:04:07 actually im not sure what you can do

help 2022-08-18 02:04:29 maybe ask someone more skilled
help 2022-08-18 02:04:34 but as far as i know im not really sure if you can fold it
help 2022-08-18 02:05:51 to keep it simple i would switch the end and middle piece
help 2022-08-18 02:05:54 so have the end on the top
help 2022-08-18 02:05:56 and the middle on the bottom
help 2022-08-18 02:51:56 looks pretty nice so far
help 2022-08-18 02:52:15 canopy looks kind of odd though

plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:00:26 nice
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:00:32 really like how smooth everything is
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:01:00 how did you do the angled windows for the bridge?
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:01:06 motorlock tower and just angle signs or text?
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:01:23 alr
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:04:33 oh you angled the entire wall
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:04:49 i mean im sure i could angle just normal text or a sign couldnt i
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:04:57 the bridge angle on mine is only a round wedge out
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:05:05 so i just need like 1 window there
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:05:44 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:05:50 hmm which ones
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:05:57 oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:01 i could try doing that
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:05 same way i did the front
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:22 yeah i realized that about halfway through the hull
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:28 i just havent bothered to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:34 i dont think itd be too difficult
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:42 id probably just have to move the front angle up higher and make it longer
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:06:48 and probably move the forward turret up some
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:00 yeah ill try and get that back angle in
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:05 might try to fix the front angle
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:14 actually the back should be pretty easy to do
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:20 since nothing major is on the angled part
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:23 only a little aa platform
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 01:07:32 yeah

Unfortunately I can't fit the angled back deck, the rear superstructure is sidelocked and i dont have the room for a custom angle on the back. Right now I'm working on a measure 12 camo
