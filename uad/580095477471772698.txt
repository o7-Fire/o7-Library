bug-reports 2020-12-18 12:59:29 Bug: Camera rotation does not save when loaded back in 
Username: BariscilLego
bug-reports 2020-12-18 13:05:04 but there are people who is going to use a lot of these cameras
bug-reports 2020-12-18 13:06:34 i think that would be annoying having to rotate all of them just to use the build
bug-reports 2020-12-18 13:13:06 but it is not intended to be that way (as i know) so its still a bug
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 19:07:37 does only my game keep crashing?

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:48:20 when i say i fold with motorlock i mean this
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:48:29 it took me a while to join a game
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:48:55 no rotation
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:49:34 
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:49:46 theres alot of walls thats why it is so compact
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:49:57 yes?

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:00:43 if you are planning on doing it an underwater base you know you can't walk underwater

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:18 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:48 is it detachable?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:58 or its just sticked to the ropes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:13:36 you can use magnets to detach that
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:37 oh you are doing it for the contest
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:43 well idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:49 i didn't read it
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:15:42 it needs to detach i think
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:16:08 
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:17:06 **wat**

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:04:51 i never tried it
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:05:14 because there was no space but real planes have suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:05:18 if you have space yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:06:23 oh that
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:06:33 i think it will not fit
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:07:06 and it might just look like its not connected so i say no
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:08:25 should i do this
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:10:18 i dunno i might just drop stuff in mach 3
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:11:29 the back seat if the last photo is the back seat has a good vision
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:12:47 looks nice

help 2021-01-30 07:15:28 i think i never did an inside
help 2021-01-30 07:18:40 good idea
help 2021-01-30 07:19:17 i am just wondering how you are gonna fit all the motorlocks
bot-central 2021-01-30 07:34:37 !rank
help 2021-01-30 07:38:20 wait let me check
help 2021-01-30 07:38:42 oh sry it was my mistake
general 2021-01-30 07:42:33 noice
general 2021-01-30 07:44:09 seems legit
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:47:14 wait it has bombs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:52:12 i think 4 is good
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:52:28 how big are the bombs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:52:41 oh then put 15 or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:52:48 i am thinking about missile size
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:53:16 they break alot
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:53:29 sometimes controls reverse themselves
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:54:12 im gonna start buidling once my school is over do you think i should put cargo at the blue spot or the red?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:54:37 i can't do both i need a free space for all the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:54:52 red is it
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:55:22 hmm blue is a light so it is red
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:55:24 jk
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:55:50 thats the thing i am best at
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:55:56 compact motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:57:26 for cargo or motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:58:17 the point is if i do red it will be easier for me to deploy the cargo but i can't reach them from the cocpit so if something gets stuck thats it
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:58:24 and for blue its the reverse
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:59:08 what
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 07:59:33 oh sry i didn't say it earlier this is fedex
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:00:04 this
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:00:05 
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:00:30 its the most random thing and thats why i am building it
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:01:49 im doing red cargo
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:14:21 tbh doing motorlock in a small space has a problem
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:14:23 weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:14:48 so i don't really know how its gonna work because this is a plane but we'll see
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:15:52 i do that too motor tower
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:16:57 thats a bit annoying but a bit fun if you ask me
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:18:08 it looks nice at the end
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:18:57 holy the motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:19:24 tbh sometimes motorlock out in the open looks good
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:19:50 but you should work on this barrel
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:21:29 big boi
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:22:18 brb
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:24:06 for some reason i never do an all paint
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:24:17 everytime i just paint it one by one
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 08:25:00 thats gonna look good
general 2021-01-30 08:27:55 tactical truck
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:28:22 does anyone know if sr71 has flaps or not
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:30:25 nope just a fedex plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:30:44 might put it if i make it in time but im juts doing it for fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:32:00 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:32:13 your ctrl v could be broken
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:32:16 it happens
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:33:57 seems legit
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:34:13 i am looking at that
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:34:28 i just wanted to ask so i don't have to spend my time
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:34:38 and nobody knows i think
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:34:56 like what is an outboard elevon trailing edge
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 09:35:14 its supposed to be a control surface but what

plane-crazy 2021-02-02 11:59:06 mods are there for hours

general 2021-02-03 06:55:12 how did he make something that good that quick?
general 2021-02-03 06:55:53 ask a mod for hof
the-dump 2021-02-03 06:59:51 i think they are reworking the code
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:00:00 to add more stuff and fix stuff
general 2021-02-03 07:00:13 joke
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:01:13 code is right now hard coded and some people told me
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:01:25 also if you think about no updates it makes sense why
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:02:20 what was that
general 2021-02-03 07:02:46 take my upvote
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:03:06 those reflexes were so fast jeez
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:03:21 good build
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:03:50 idk about the real one but those holes are not there i suppose
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:05:41 alot of curves
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:06:15 at least you have alot of space to work with
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:06:26 its not like 3x3 space with that much detail
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:07:07 use cameras
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:07:14 its easier
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:07:42 its easy just don't attach to the main build then select the target you want to rotate at
the-dump 2021-02-03 07:07:48 alr plane crazy now
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:07:59 hi im here now
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:08:25 try it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:08:57 basically its attached to main pilot seat no matter what
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:09:13 so you have the motor lock your pilot seat down to up
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:09:18 so you have space for it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:10:01 you know its attached to the main pilot seat right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:10:04 no matter what
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:10:28 what
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:11:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:11:20 you can't turn the cameras at the other half
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:11:26 they will just get stuck there
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:11:42 thats actually the reason i only fold with motorlock now
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:12:46 so you can say the main pilot seat and cameras are one piece
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:12:54 if you move mps it goes with it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:13:02 rtx on
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:13:18 
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:13:24 it just turned more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:13:55 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:14:04 so thats how it works
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:14:14 only limitation is space
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:14:18 alr
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:15:58 that one kid
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:16:06 punch the kid that trolled
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:16:43 its actually a bit true about it breakes your builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:16:54 if you attach it it just wents all over the place
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:18:10 easter egg
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:18:25 annoying part is you have to close edit and open again to edit an another camera
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:18:33 when it comes to selecting
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:18:42 and it doesn't save the rotations
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:18:56 so i suggest painting the ones that will rotate to red
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:20:04 its best if you test it yourself
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:20:11 you'll understand it better
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 07:20:16 and i am gone
general 2021-02-03 07:32:03 what do you mean?
general 2021-02-03 07:32:52 you know i am joking about it right?

plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:10:28 **the motorlock**
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:11:43 i think you could have use the engines to hide them but who cares its still good

plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:23:25 oooh
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:23:29 i see
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:23:54 i never tried it because of that

plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:24:14 lock did nothing so i didn't use it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:25:27 this chat has turned into a talk of gods
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:25:41 everyone is just slaping each other with locks
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:26:24 suicede
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 08:27:50 imagine if you ran out of motors at some point
general 2021-02-03 08:40:19 i mean i got banned for tagging jorbunga at badyacht so
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:28:26 one block too long
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:28:53 also needs more aim on the back
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:28:57 for the wing
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:29:52 we all start from somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:31:13 its always that time when you type you realize your mistake
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:36:11 thats perfect if you ask me
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 09:37:59 motor 2's are broken

plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:08:13 does it still turn when closed or just turning and no lift?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:08:42 if not enough make it enough
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:09:37 maybe phisic engine doesn't detect the weight of the blocks that are extended by the priston

plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:59:19 can you get terrain ranks from robots?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 21:00:15 but aren't they also on floor?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 21:00:49 planes mainly move by flying
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 21:00:58 robots mainly move by being on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 21:01:27 oh

general 2021-02-05 06:12:26 and the only hate i got is "why the engines so big"

plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:19:22 you need a rework on the wings they are too thin
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:19:53 other than that it looks good if you ask me
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:25:31 more wider i would say
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:26:20 is contest started?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:26:52 or its still in voting
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:27:14 so i can't get started yet
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:27:29 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:27:33 i got nothing to do now
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:28:15 might just work on how sails would work
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:29:01 no i want to push it with sails
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:29:19 i've done before i just need to make it triangle
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:29:27 propeller
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:29:49 put small amount of proppeler inside the sails
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:30:26 im not gonna talk more or people will get ideas
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:31:01 it works on square sails i just don't know if triangle sails would work
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:31:03 we'll see
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:31:45 im gonna make this
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 09:32:17 i hope it won't tip over when i use the sails

plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:01:53 why did this get so many upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:05:14 i mean there are websites that you can check where the pixels would go
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:05:36 there are even colour ones like thishttps://imagecolorpicker.com
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:05:58 how do i know if they put work or not if its a 5 min build or not
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:12:20 how much time do you thing there has been spent on it?
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:12:51 i spent 4 days doing a plane that gets the exact same
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:13:43 idk i just don't get whats hard about creating a pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:13:55 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:14:04 i will try it
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:14:31 thats the thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:14:39 i don't think it deserves that much
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:14:47 it still deserves like 70-80
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:15:11 its my opinion on it
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:15:45 thats good
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:16:02 that pixel art is good but that spooky doo...
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 08:16:54 i mean i am working on this
creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:31:05 1st build: fan wings
2nd build:exposed motors
3rd build:wings are slim
4th build:vertical wings not attached and wings are slim
creations-chat 2021-03-03 17:38:39 i might be a bit late but i don't see any anger behind a person saying "how do you do that"
creations-chat 2021-03-04 07:22:12 are we sure they made this?https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/816860234080845834

creations-chat 2021-03-10 09:08:47 i've been building this for a long time now but i never shared it here for feedback so what can i do to improve this model or is it good enough?(im colouring it)
creations-chat 2021-03-10 09:12:59 perhaps they couldn't handle a warn
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 07:42:28 im gonna put this in one side of the gun i am building, i was gonna put the same text on the other side aswell but its too big, so i need an another sentence that is smaller
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 07:42:48 anyone know a sentence i can put at the other side?
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:24:56 <@!484529511468236802>  maybe use this colour for the blades?
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:27:36 im in school rn so i can't
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:32:49 maybe this?
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 10:14:37 did you check if these ones are locked?
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 10:15:37 np
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 10:26:28 put two more motors at the blue and a cylinder at the black
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 09:34:02 i am going so fast
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:54:39 any feedback on this?
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:54:59 yes it does
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:55:25 vehicle can turn move forward
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:55:30 gun can just do up and down
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:55:52 but you can turn the vehicle itself so i just forgot about turning the gun itself
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 11:56:38 i want to get this in hof
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 12:01:15 i shall commit photos
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:21:06 15k its a straight up ship
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:23:40 i use it in expert server 2 because there would be noone there
it freezes for a solid 5 secs when spawned
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:26:20 using lagy stuff in public servers is not good for other people and you
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:28:46 <@!712358550097231934>  is the reason for downvote the comically big cannon or something else?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:31:44 <@!782361431726620733>  maybe put some trails behind the engines to make the afterburner more realistic?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:34:42 im just giving them ideas saying "start over" doesn't change anything they will come with the same detail
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:38:31 i would say kinda because everywhere i go no matter what my opinion is i get "ok and" or " <:sus:805543105428193301> "
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:41:00 nice letters you got there
i believe you person under me
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:44:02 but its not the same, the one block inside is probably different
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:46:04 im joking
creations-chat 2021-03-14 06:08:46 ^looks good
what can i improve on this because i see downvotes
creations-chat 2021-03-14 06:11:31 tbh the gun is comically big for the size of the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:19:34 i didn't get the upvotes i thought i would get so im gonna make a new outside for the walls, texture it a bit more(camouflage, armour exc) and make it even older
is there anything else i should change on this?
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:42:35 just started working on it but thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:46:59 c130 has the most custom angles in planes if you ask me
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:49:25 im having alot of problems right now
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:51:44 i need motorlock and i am having problems finding a place to steal from myself
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:55:46 it doesn't really matter if its glass or not because you can't really see inside from outside anyway and only thing that matters when putting something in creations is look
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:00:40 yes alot of people know that, it just looks cool thats why they build it
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:03:27 i love how you started the conversation
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:15:21 ~~make it 1:1~~
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 10:32:41 i may or may not have created a face by accident
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:41:39 you were right its already looking better
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:48:26 i have almost no space left and it is one plot
there are cranes inside of barrels, wheels inside of floors
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:08:51 foodback
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:11:09 because of the ridiculous size of the gun i can just imagine people like this
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:13:18 i wanted to create a big artilery moving thing and i got inspired by p1500 should i name it something different?
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:15:19 lmao
i was gonna make it 5 meter diameter and add more stuff but someone in a different server wanted it to be 10 meter diameter so i did that
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:17:25 ik but it would have been a bit more realistic considering the size of the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:20:44 if i would be real i continued to build it because it was just so ridiculous
should i send this in the creations or should i add more detail?
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:31:11 big guns are getting a trend today
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:38:32 yes the gun is a bit massive
if i will ever remake this i will either make the vehicle itself bigger or make the gun smaller
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:43:19 the reason i am putting the gun to the back of the to do list is gun parts are almost inside of each other which makes it hard to colour or detail but i'll do it
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:46:22 yes 80 hours of work is not enough
creations-chat 2021-03-16 07:58:42 engines are exposed
creations-chat 2021-03-16 08:07:11 i am talking about these ones btw the back ones look good
creations-chat 2021-03-18 06:26:04 "detail"
creations-chat 2021-03-18 06:28:47 you could mearial some of the stuff so it would look like it has more work put into it
like make the tracs slate, body metal
creations-chat 2021-03-18 06:41:38 https://gyazo.com/0333b68c1360726499447941aef037e9
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:16:06 just imagine
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:49:33 pilot seat is the same as a main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:49:44 you can control stuff from it
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:50:05 main pilot seat is the one you spawn in, thats the only difference
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:51:04 <@!529454050039693314>
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:51:24 oh wait sry wrong ping
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:51:54 <@!360288216550604800>
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:53:58 you can choose which parts to control?
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:58:50 as i know its the same as main pilot
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:58:55 have the same controls
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:59:28 you should be able to control the same stuff with same controls
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:04:55 should i make these sand parts darker?
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:17:33 you were right its already looking better
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:32:05 i got inspired by it so i actually wrote p1500 on the other side but because some people said i should change it, it is not existing p1700 now
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:34:25 its a bit short but i don't think you can do anything about that now
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:41:33 because someone wanted it to be and also it makes the thing even larger and it looks ridiculous
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:46:09 also i learned smoke stops moving when you are not looking at it while making this
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:50:57 nice
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:24:10 how do you make that?
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:33:47 now that is already more than enough detail
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:41:05 ^perhaps thats why they suggested that
it looked a bit dull so i decided to write something and someone responded with achtung panzer so i decided to write that because it sounds cool
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:45:23 grammar is nice
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:48:06 achtung panzer barely fits there and i am almost out of motors so i can't extend it
also i don't really like the swear words if i am honest
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:52:10 i don't think that fits the vibe of ww2
general 2021-03-20 07:47:43 the man just wants to save the planet
general 2021-03-20 07:48:35 that doesn't matter
general 2021-03-20 07:48:45 anyone can save the planet with weird symbols
creations-chat 2021-03-20 12:16:26 i think black and green looks good
creations-chat 2021-03-20 12:18:52 foodback should i change this wall texture to a mix of something else
creations-chat 2021-03-20 13:53:43 96+ hours ingame

creations-chat 2021-03-20 14:20:49 ya call that big

lmao
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:07:01 what is v tec
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:09:10 that really doesn't explain anything
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:11:23 you mean this?
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:13:45 if you are talking about cooling stuff it already has fans(this is an old photo)
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:16:35 i am not saying this to get away with not putting it but what im trying to create here is an old ww2 landkreuzer
and i don't think thats an old thing used in wars
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:19:11 ww2 started in 1939 ended in 1945, honda was founded in 1948
i don't think honda can time travel
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:21:20 those are there to cool the engine not the gun
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:29:27 yes it does work(old photo)
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:37:04 im done for today but i need to colour inside of the barrel and some bits where the gun sits
im gonna do it tomorrow
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:40:18 can you send it here or dm me?
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:45:16 ikr almost out of them, i am surprised they managed to finish the build
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:41:46 nice i accidentally pressed enter
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:44:37 so i did what i wanted to do with this creations, if feedback says nothing more to add i'll be sending this in about 5 hours
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:49:18 i got inspired by p1500 because i wanted to create some big artilery gun, but it looked small so i maked it bigger(theres no blueprint or name for it)
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:53:52 17k+
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:55:54 that image is cursed from now on
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 15:00:39 nice
general 2021-03-22 15:02:33 when is the server in its active hours? i never considered posting stuff in active hours
general 2021-03-22 15:02:52 yes i understand letter language
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:10:02 lol
theres already crates its just big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:12:06 ammo are just inside of the barrel, the back opens but i never took the time to release the ammo from the barrel because it takes a solid 15 mins for it to slide down
perhaps i should do it, something could be broke
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:14:26 somethings broke, i got something to do yay
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:19:25 i just realized i did not colour the inside of this but you reload it by opening the back
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:28:00 heres also one of the ammo out
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:30:00 right
creations-chat 2021-03-22 16:00:29 no tracks
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:24:07 hipity hopitiy get my downvote
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:27:44 <@!527653676022628353> whats wrong with the creation
well it kinda ruins it but theres nothing i can do about that because i realised i did the gun too big when i was halfway done 
atleast you have a reason and im happy with that
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:30:52 well the gun took me about 50 hours or so because of all the walls and floors everywhere and the folding stuff
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:32:53 17K
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:35:22 i have to do something irl so if i don't respond to stuff for about an hour understand why
creations-chat 2021-03-22 18:50:26 maybe you can change rockets to costume rockets if possible and make the wings 0.5 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:40:41 so theres this rule for shipwright but what about blocks that are stuck to each other but not connected?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:41:01 like this
creations-chat 2021-03-22 19:41:21 they look better for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:41:42 i want to do a ship but i'll need multiple accounts thats why im asking
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:43:41 theres no way i can do this with 1 account
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:47:37 but they move together
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:48:11 well if you put multiple of those attachy things it would be one
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:48:29 im gonna make seawise so yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:48:48 if i calculated stuff correct
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:49:07 idk i never saw it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:49:26 oh then i definetly not saw it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:50:26 should i ping a mod and ask them?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:50:43 not random blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:51:49 <@!273536574770380800>  i got a question about attached blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:52:00 is it ok if they are attached like the pic i put?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:52:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:53:27 should i ping a server admin then?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:54:14 i have no idea what obc or hyper is
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:54:32 oh they are people
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:54:37 im stupid
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:55:39 <@!195253906333368320>  i got a question is it ok if i attach blocks like how i did in the pic?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:56:13 its possible and it works and i need it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:59:09 alr im about to go sleep in 30 mins or so it doesn't really matter if the response is late
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 19:59:43 im just gonna start building for this 30 mins because i got nothing else to do
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:03:12 i responded a bit late but thx
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:14:51 and clicking begins
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:16:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:17:24 its 69 that surprised me too
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:18:06 this whole thing is a joke
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:18:17 
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:21:52 is the cylinder moving too?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:16 fisik is nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:30 is it locked?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:44 that explains it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:58 locked doesn't care about anything and just goes
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:23:10 at least thats my experience with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:25:19 im gonna go to sleep but before is this tall enough for the seawise hull or is it too tall?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:25:42 3
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:26:04 theres nothing saying how tall it is i can find
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:26:24 which is kind of annoying for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:26:56 alr
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:27:00 30 is it
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:27:04 lemme see real quick
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:27:38 its smaller than 30
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:27:45 the one that i put the pic of
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:27:56 alr i'll try that real quick
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:28:33 
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:28:43 25 meter tall
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:29:08 HOLY
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:30:00 the things width is smaller than the height
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:30:10 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:30:33 im now wondering if i can put deck on this
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:31:00 forget about the walls wheres the deck gonna go
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:31:56 i separted them to 3 account 1 being front 2 being back bridge 1 being the hull thats is just repating
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:32:21 thats how im gonna do it but i might need to make the deck separete with front and the back
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:32:36 so 1st account just has the walls
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:32:58 ima go sleep bye
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:45:56 if i manage to connect them i think it would not be too hard
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:26:25 is this tall enough for seawise?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:29:53 im surprised nobody maked it 1:1 sooner
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:30:32 i was expecting to see some in hof but none
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:51:35 wall
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:58:09 yes 70 meters
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:58:29 which will look good once its finished ngl
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:58:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:59:01 i managed to find a way to make them easily with no material ran out and compact
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 13:59:21 so im in progress now
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:00:04 problem is
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:00:11 how am i gonna colour this
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:00:49 it will take an awful lot of time to colour this
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:01:10 because theres so many big spots with different colours
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:01:23 it won't effect the process too much
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:02:08 i would just colour and metarial the whole underwater colour when i start colouring but still alot of stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:02:26 smh how hard is it smh
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:03:44 wait really?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:46:15 more walls
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:47:34 im just building walls at the moment so no
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:47:52 theres no floor
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:54:19 thats not anchored right?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 14:54:34 damn thats stable
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:42:52 so its shorter?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:43:06 there goes the work
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:43:22 perhaps i should do more research before starting
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:43:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:44:16 ima take final pic before i remove the data
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:46:10 alr ima restart
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:46:45 i thought it was 70 meters
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:47:18 idk why i did not notice it sooner if im gonna be honest
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:04:09 you think this height is good?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:04:43 nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:05:01 50 or a bit more
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:05:21 its hard to guess how tall it is because of the folding
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:07:18 im too lazy for that **let me just waste 5 more hours**
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:07:54 if you want to you can
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:09:27 im making seawise
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:09:52 
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:10:23 im going to use 3 accounts
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:10:31 1 for middle 2 for front 3 for back
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:10:39 thx
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:11:26 you just connect them with arms
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:12:20 it needs to turn and move so i cant do that
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:14:11 like this, you get the arm stuck
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 16:14:27 so it is one
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:55:04 it depends on which angle you take the pic, how many pics do you post, what time do you post and how detailed it is
creations-chat 2021-03-24 07:57:28 also you might want to check those
creations-chat 2021-03-24 09:51:41 ""fair""
creations-chat 2021-03-24 09:55:44 can you take a photo of this and send it here?
creations-chat 2021-03-24 10:02:55 im not saying this to harras someone but i don't think alot of the people that can think mass downvote
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 10:49:01 seawise is very possible with 3 accounts
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 10:49:38 wide
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 10:54:51 i might just spawn it in at random servers for fun when its finished
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 10:56:12 i'll just spawn in with 1 of them because i would need my friends time too to spawn them all
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 11:01:56 doesn't it work if you ballast bottom and put helium above?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 11:02:27 use only ballast
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 11:05:12 don't put a bottom, problem solved
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 18:02:39 there are rally good games on roblox like flightline plane crazy or dss(in my opnion)
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 08:14:50 time to start the flooring
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:51:39 yes im trying to make the middle long as possible then im going to complete it with the other 2 accounts
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:52:07 i might need a 4th one for the deck but we'll see about that one because im not sure if i would need 4th
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:53:55 lemme check real quick
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:54:23 51
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:55:10 if you count the holes between plots it would look like 8 plots ingame
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:55:13 thx
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:56:20 im afraid i will need 4th account because only device i could use for it would be an old laptop
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 10:56:26 i hope it would handle it
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:18:52 this is going to be pain i can feel it
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:19:19 seawise, i am starting the front
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:20:51 i just need 3 or 4 accounts and let me change the front as you said real quick
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:21:23 1 for front 1 for middle 1 for back 1 for left over parts and some deck stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:21:46 i will hold them in place by arms using pistons because magnets don't work
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:22:34 well if you look at it its just a box with another small box on it
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:23:04 i got the middle walls done too
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:23:08 im in an alt
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:23:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:23:38 i finished this
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:23:58 but only the walls im gonna do the deck parts in the future
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:25:37 just look at hof and you'll see many
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:27:59 die

plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:42:52 i don't see a place i can put links at

plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:44:06 i might just google this and stop being lazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:48:55 google is not helping
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:49:34 is there a way to connect links or something i am confused
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:50:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:51:20 im trying to join expert2 from microsoft store but i can't find how
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:55:41 the info i find says you can't am i really gonna create a vip server for this build
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 07:59:37 i don't even remember who they are tbh
creations-chat 2021-03-30 06:29:20 theres nothing such as "i ran out of space"
creations-chat 2021-03-30 07:07:56 you can always put walls closer together to make more space
with that way you can get a plot wide-4/5 blocks and 2.5 plots long builds easily
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 07:21:08 its right now worse

plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:33:54 yes you can do that easily you won't get a special rank for it
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:34:14 i can just add wings to my landkruezer and make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:36:47 stormworks is juts confusing
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:36:52 but its good
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:37:17 ik and thats a good thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:37:30 it shows how some people can do stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 09:38:05 i hope plane crazy gets those wedges some day

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:22:13 hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:22:59 i just did alt tab and it happened
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:23:12 i guess it works like that too sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:23:34 isn't nose a bit too short?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:26:03 just delete a built
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:28:00 can i see the plane you are building?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:29:24 **oh**
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:31:10 hmm yes thats spitfire
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:31:56 you need to make the nose rounder
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:32:28 use the thing where you turn parts and lock them together so it looks rounder
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:32:55 motorlock with extra steps
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:33:02 you turn parts
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:34:16 like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:34:26 you get a rounder shape
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:35:50 but the fact is putting more work doesn't always make it look better
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:36:18 tbh its your choice to do it or not
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:36:29 it doesn't matter too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:51:24 is this katyusha skeleton good for scale?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:51:41 
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:52:00 about how much?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:52:17 2 is way too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:53:25 do i make this part longer?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:54:51 i did not start doing lock i just put some for scale stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:55:03 i need the scale first
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:55:50 better?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:55:57 i don't see pain
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:56:05 its just 5 blocks or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:58:55 hide the locks
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 14:59:20 bruh how did that send the pic

plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:09:09 whats the problem?
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:09:42 is it about the damage or something?
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:09:56 or the fact sometimes fireworks hits your own build
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:10:06 **what**
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:12:32 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 09:12:44 did you try rejoining?

creations-chat 2021-06-21 09:38:12 The Guns have gaps in them so they don't look real
creations-chat 2021-06-29 08:47:59 that is so simple to build why
creations-chat 2021-06-29 08:50:32 it doesn't even have the texture

creations-chat 2021-07-08 14:39:11 the back motorlock should be easy considering the amount of space but i only see this part to hide the motorlock on the wings, that would be hard
creations-chat 2021-07-08 15:25:09 it looks perfect now i can't think of anything else wrong
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:29:06 i think i should finish this, it has been 7 months or more
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:29:34 it's a moving crane, i never finished the crane part
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:29:49 i got into dss 3 a little too much
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:30:02 i sunk about 900 people, im back

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:30:46 i want to finish this first now before going into the seawise once again

help 2021-07-17 11:32:30 is anyone else experiencing this or am i just missing something?
help 2021-07-17 11:36:21 alr then im just gonna put some weight to "balance" it more
help 2021-07-17 11:36:29 lol
help 2021-07-17 11:36:45 im trying to only use motors
help 2021-07-17 11:37:17 that could work
help 2021-07-17 11:37:24 im gonna try both
help 2021-07-17 11:37:32 weight and thrust difference
help 2021-07-17 11:44:24 idk if that's the cause of it because both of them are bouncing
help 2021-07-17 11:44:35 give me a sec ima remove the supension and try again
help 2021-07-17 11:46:20 for some reason now it is turning right
help 2021-07-17 11:46:31 it is not because of gear
help 2021-07-17 11:51:47 i got ropes in my propellers to make sure they're at the same angle but even then it turns
help 2021-07-17 11:52:24 i don't even have my rotors angle front back left and right, i control it from the wings
help 2021-07-17 12:03:44 im sure they don't
help 2021-07-17 12:03:55 there was one time they did and they keeped stopping randomly
help 2021-07-17 12:04:13 they're not stopping randomly anymore so i guess they're not in contact
help 2021-07-17 12:04:30 i think in the end im gonna need to use engines to balance it out
help 2021-07-17 12:04:50 because it seems to be random everytime i spawn how much it turns and where it turns
help 2021-07-17 12:09:29 5 blades per rotor
help 2021-07-17 12:10:01 it turning at a random direction everytime i spawn
help 2021-07-17 12:10:08 when im flying it starts turning
help 2021-07-17 12:10:54 sort of
help 2021-07-17 12:11:10 i mean it still moves and i did not balance it perfectly so it tilts to front a bit
help 2021-07-17 12:11:41 yes
help 2021-07-17 12:12:04 random

creations-chat 2021-08-23 07:57:47 some people just don't understand they're not the only one living on earth
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:19:36 should i give air to ground missiles to this
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:19:43 or bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:20:25 i got no use for it other than fly around
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:21:30 i got alot of space for bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:22:29 oh wait you're right i forgot about that
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:22:35 lets put nukes inside it
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:23:20 alr now i need to make a nuclear missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:24:13 oh i would want to make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:24:26 is there a name for it or did you just hear from somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:25:17 im gonna drop 4 nukes on a ship lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:25:33 that's a bomb not a nuclear missile
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:26:09 afk a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:27:14 im back
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:27:31 oh boy oh boy
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:29:53 those rotors are gonna be alot of pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:30:32 but it would be worth the trouble
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:30:41 and i bet it would be really stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:30:55 considering there's 6 rotors to balance it out
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:31:20 this is literally an oversized drone with nuclear missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:32:32 actually i don't think this is gonna be that hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:32:56 it doesn't have any complex shapes and angeles on every wing on every direction like v12
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:33:57 alr ima find alot of pics, blueprints and some info about how it fully works then build it
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:34:19 that's a good idea if you want to build a jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 13:34:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 14:41:13 you could do this with trails and rotate it with motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 14:41:44 actually that would work better as that is 1 block wide

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 10:53:56 im liking the look of this
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 10:55:51 say that to every vehicle ever made by man kind
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 10:56:50 is that a joystick
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:03:07 maybe i should put one of these tower things there
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:03:26 because it looks like one of these at the moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:06:30 i already made the v12
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:06:42 i wanted to make a custom heli
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:06:54 with no limit of trying to make it realistic and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:18:38 maybe i should have pointed out it is a heli
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:19:34 it's gonna be great
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:20:47 but im afraid i think we're gonna need to remodel alot of the builds because the jet engine photo we got had cylinder front and a different back
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:21:16 making the builds look different and maybe ruin some
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:21:28 i say it would be worth it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:22:08 i would love to pick up people with helis
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:22:44 also i hope we get a gear box so two motors rotate as one
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:23:10 it is just so annoying to have 1 motor out of 5 being different and ruining everything
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:23:38 brb
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:24:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:24:47 i think the worst part of this problem is rotors on helis
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:27:26 and it just feels random
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:27:38 everytime a different one fails
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:48:45 i mean that would make everything so much easier as you can just build trough where people would walk
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:50:03 i hope the camera lock won't be fixed in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:50:55 i can imagine that being really hard even if it worked
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:51:51 it is a ball
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:52:21 yeah that is legal
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:52:31 just make sure you don't suck the entire world
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:05:40 so many visible motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:06:09 it is just the basics of planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:07:49 i just have this 1 block gap in builds that i put all the motorlock in
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:09:13 actually now im wondering can i make my heli pick up a whole ship
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:09:25 runway needs more detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:11:06 i mean the shape is really good, it is really ready to add stuff into it
bot-central 2021-08-26 13:44:41 -servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:03:36 hull of the heli is done
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:03:55 yes custom
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:04:12 thx
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:04:29 i couldn't find anything bigger than v12 that looked good so i decided to go custom
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:04:54 looking good so far
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:05:16 but i would suggest you fix these fan wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:06:06 knifes together, strong
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:06:28 just motorlock wings inside the wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:08:11 now i need to figure out how to fit 6 giant rotors in this space
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:08:50 truly handsome
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:09:59 if it is not a double rotor idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:10:11 i don't know how to make single rotors
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:11:40 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:18:22 because i need to put the stuff together
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:18:34 it is bigger than the plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:19:38 because if all the rotors faced up when in build mode it would be easier to fit everything and it won't fold once i put force into rotors
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 15:20:19 im planning to lift a whole ship it's gonna take alot of force i don't think a motor can stand

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:35:21 is the wing too big or is my brain playing games again
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:41:15 opinions?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:42:32 im gonna be honest i play plane crazy for the waky stuff, it gives you challanges you won't get in any other building game
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:42:51 pc 2 is gonna have those stuff fixed so im probably gonna stay in normal pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:43:38 like the rope glitching out stuff, blocks somehow getting into each other, roblox pyshics stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:44:06 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:44:12 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:44:44 but it does give a challange in some builds, trying to fix it by doing more waky stuff which is always fun to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:45:39 i agree with that
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 14:48:33 i think the wing is now the right length
creations-chat 2021-12-03 10:05:14 Personally i don't like to do angle locking much because you need to move the main pilot seat like 10 blocks to somewhere but when you do it, it pays off
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:50:23 Do it, nothing is stopping you
the-dump 2021-12-15 17:36:44 you can have this plane crazy, i regret it

creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:57:41 the point of using control surfaces?

they are motorlocked so no gaps
help 2021-12-17 16:01:51 small 5-6 bombs inside the plane or one big bomb outside the plane
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:44:19 yes i like it, not too complex to hurt your eyes but has enough detail on it
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 05:14:47 We already can have everything in the picture you send because of motorlock and vanky cameras
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:36:37 now that it is getting colour im loving it
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:37:08 epic
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:51:25 would anyone notice if the red thing on the back is not a red star?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:52:05 i couldn't find a red star so i used a stop sign
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:52:47 what could i use for there
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 08:52:54 i can't do much motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:03:24 sry for late response, i can't do that
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:03:51 it is small enough to not matter but also small enough to annoy people
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:03:57 so im just stuck
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:04:07 yes, i like it

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 11:04:30 i mean the building mode height limit
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 11:05:06 ah i see
creations-chat 2021-12-23 05:53:05 i would suggest missiles at the back or a tank cannon at the front
creations-chat 2021-12-23 11:23:13 overconfidence will get you there, you try harder and harder every build, you don't know where people will end up as time goes on
help 2021-12-23 18:50:45 it will come out when it is ready
general 2021-12-23 20:03:08 i think the bigger problem here is the lack of mods not creation feedback
general 2021-12-23 20:04:15 idk pcc much but as i understand there is like 4 mods that are trying to check everyone and understandably can't
general 2021-12-23 20:05:00 to fix a community you need mods to inforce rules and good rules, you need good mods
general 2021-12-23 20:06:23 i don't want to advertise stuff but i come from dss and we got 20 mods for 3k people meanwhile here we got 4 for more people
general 2021-12-23 20:06:25 we need mods
general 2021-12-23 20:06:51 and all 3k are not even active, there is like 100 people ingame at once
general 2021-12-23 20:07:02 they can't enforce the rules well
general 2021-12-23 20:07:11 and the community becomes toxic for no rules
general 2021-12-23 20:08:03 i agree with not strict moderation
general 2021-12-23 20:08:17 but as i see it we got a loose one
general 2021-12-23 20:10:22 badyacht, shipping lanes, idk many servers
general 2021-12-23 20:10:36 but they have a nice community
general 2021-12-23 20:10:50 meanwhile here more freedom but in a bad way
general 2021-12-23 20:12:49 what would be loose is saying no swearing but allowing anything other than the f word
general 2021-12-23 20:13:11 what would be strict is saying no swearing and not allowing even saying pancake as it could be a swear
general 2021-12-23 20:14:39 seeing just 1 mod online and 2-3 channels being talked at once just doesn't seem right to me, i just wanted to say that
general 2021-12-23 20:15:17 they can't moderate like this, there is not enough people to watch over
general 2021-12-23 20:15:54 no, remember they got lives too
general 2021-12-23 20:16:51 i would like to direct your attention to <#504436696021204992> , we got toxicity every 5-10 minutes
general 2021-12-23 20:17:22 it is still bad for new players
general 2021-12-23 20:17:53 i have the same point
general 2021-12-23 20:18:15 well alr why were we arguing
general 2021-12-23 20:18:48 ah yes, i think i got names confused
general 2021-12-23 20:19:04 idk
general 2021-12-23 20:19:23 if you want us to help maybe go into more detail?
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 20:20:58 you were cool for a second and then because of this you are no longer cool
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 20:21:42 perhaps add more texture to it, other than that the model is great
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 20:22:25 like dirt and stuff, make the inside seats look like leather
general 2021-12-23 20:23:00 welp im happy for you
creations-chat 2021-12-23 20:23:48 at last, a good message!
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 20:40:13 Yes i meant something like that, i need to sleep so goodbye

plane-crazy 2021-12-24 05:47:43 life is great
creations-chat 2021-12-24 05:48:17 why downvote, it is a small build with a fair amount of detail
creations-chat 2021-12-24 05:50:53 well that explains why there are downvotes

bug-reports 2021-12-24 05:52:55 you suffer till it works
bug-reports 2021-12-24 10:14:32 ~~you make them work~~ custom missiles?
bug-reports 2021-12-24 10:15:19 if they are custom and freezing mid air put a motor 2 that follows your mouse in it so it updates itself
bug-reports 2021-12-24 10:15:51 idk then
bug-reports 2021-12-24 10:15:55 i never experienced it
creations-chat 2021-12-24 10:41:35 if you make yours even smaller it is gonna be made out of 5 blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-24 11:57:13 it feels a bit too bright for the eye, perhaps make it a little more darker and have some details like numbers with signs at the sides of it perhaps
creations-chat 2021-12-25 08:26:12 if only people just not say anything if they don't want to give feedback

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:06:59 sadly the star doesn't get bigger

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:09:51 the star can only get as big as a 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:10:01 it is this big

creations-chat 2022-01-18 10:43:19 Anytime
creations-chat 2022-01-18 11:37:25 what i suggest doing when starting a build is no matter what hide all your locks when you put them, if you don't hide one you might need to rebuild an entire section or make it overcomplicated Just to hide that one lock

plane-crazy 2022-01-20 08:37:00 thx for the help
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 08:38:17 hello
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 08:48:50 im loving it
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 08:49:14 definitely
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 20:37:01 hammer
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 10:14:34 Buy a cup stabilizer
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 10:15:37 Epic
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 14:49:39 stick
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:00:51 im loving it
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:01:22 if you want to
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:01:37 it seems complex which should be fun
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:02:45 it looks a bit too simple maybe add details with signs, ladders, trails exc. and the barrel is way too wide sparklers would be better
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:03:08 also it needs texturing
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:03:34 if you are not going for a picture perfect tank it looks good
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:06:17 i put alot of effort to get that white
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:32:54 part of the tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:33:23 i mean it is not connected, it is just a crane to hold the barrel up
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:34:14 ok let me make the barrel even more massive
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:35:47 i mean i see your point and i get it, it does look really weird with stuff being oversized
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:36:18 i want to have fun with this build and see what will come out in the end
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:44:04 that is why it is a good plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 16:45:33 i bet one of the pilots was tall
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 18:47:02 is roblox down?
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 18:47:24 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 18:49:12 also why are you both bird
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 18:49:41 fair argument
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 18:49:53 facts
creations-chat 2022-01-21 18:54:52 how long is it gonna take until someone uses 10 accounts to make the entire backrooms
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 09:18:07 IT HAS 400 UPVOTES NOW?
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 09:18:13 oh good god
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 11:37:31 colour
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 11:38:04 oh i really like the look of that tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 11:39:50 *confusion*
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 11:39:59 crane for a project im working on
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 11:59:52 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:01:15 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:01:54 yooo that looks sick
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:13:30 speeeed
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:19:45 im losing my braincells over you three arguing
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:23:53 give it surface missiles because it would look funny
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:25:20 something like this
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:25:28 a box pointing up doesn't need to have actual missiles
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:26:26 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:31:21 exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:35:30 if you don't have space for motorlock, make more space with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:37:13 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:39:50 well this is gonna be a pain to colour
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:40:07 i think it is as simple as a wing that dives with a bomb
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:40:25 but im not an expert in dive bombers
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:41:31 maybe it is about roblox servers crashing
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:41:45 not myself
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:42:37 maybe it is unbalanced
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:43:42 is it something like this?
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:45:17 <@456226577798135808> i keep turning the ping off because of reflexes
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:45:56 now im confused can you send a photo?
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:48:34 oh wait i see now
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:49:11 add a ballast on the other side to balance it out like this
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 19:50:03 the motor can't keep itself raised and lowers so it tries to pull back up, it pulls too much and goes crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-22 20:04:04 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504436696021204992/927664808122261554/final_61d35354debf90003ed3805c_64315.gif
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 11:15:11 poop colour
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 11:17:02 oh thats cool
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:20:54 if it is a funny build people are most likely gonna upvote it
creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:27:41 next time you build a jet try to make the hull so it doesn't have your arms sticking out of the walls

for this build add some weapons like missiles and bombs, if you can give the back landing gears a little more angle towards the wings it could make it look much cooler, if you are gonna post it in creations add details with signs trails and such
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:04:58 this is the best suggestion i have seen yet
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:32:15 you sure you are using the up to date link?
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:34:25 it happens
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 15:02:00 interesting
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 15:03:19 sadly
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:16:19 blocky
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:17:49 bigger takes less time until you get to a scale where there is barely room left in the plot or you are using an alt account
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:18:26 epic bote
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:21:17 not in real life
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:21:44 it is modern art
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 20:22:17 it is probably better than modern art now that im looking at it
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 12:10:30 i made wall
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 12:11:44 i mean in the actual picture this is gonna be the quality you can see most

the-dump 2022-01-26 19:05:14 why

plane-crazy 2022-01-27 11:39:34 wood.
creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:53:07 i think contest winners should be able to vote for hof submissions because they usually have a good taste in what is a good build and what is not but master ranks should be able to vote too because they are the ones with one of the best builds out there
creations-chat 2022-01-29 14:10:21 the frog mobile looks stunning, only thing i would suggest is giving the wheels those metal cylinders they have in the middle of them
creations-chat 2022-01-29 14:14:48 with putting "(" on some text or using half cylinders
creations-chat 2022-01-29 14:17:09 emojis don't get big enough if it is not a 2x2 or smaller but yeah that works too
creations-chat 2022-01-29 14:24:45 good enough
help 2022-01-29 14:51:05 trial and error
help 2022-01-29 14:52:24 the best way to build without knowing what anything does or how it works is think like you know everything while building and slowly you will realise "oh this works better" or "i could do this instead"

help 2022-01-29 16:36:43 np
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 16:57:35 i just realised this has no air coming in for the engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 16:59:13 because it big
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 16:59:45 i first want to finish what im doing
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:01:29 it is 51x51x39
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:01:54 i need to write this down somewhere, i keep having to count it
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:02:40 at least it is better for boats and planes
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:03:15 i mean if it was taller the boats would be less wide
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:03:58 but to make it taller they need to take away space from somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:04:39 im just hoping in pc2 we are gonna have an option to change the plots shape
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:04:54 if not we can still do folds with hopefully less funky stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:13:14 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:30:09 **what**
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:30:28 those pictures are not coming out of my mind anytime soon
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:31:49 just do whatever you want to be honest
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:32:32 im not the best at giving ideas, i just have a random idea or trying to fix random stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:33:10 seems like a good idea to me
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:34:50 wasn't there "entity 303" too
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:35:28 LMAO
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:36:35 roblox is like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:36:54 unlike some other games it just kicks you out the instant the internet has problems
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:41:38 rust. more rust.
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:44:04 wait you could get in hof with that many upvotes back then?
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:44:23 im down to this
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:44:48 yeah probably because of that
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:46:05 also i feel like not many people do builds with alt accounts, you can build such cool stuff but i see almost none
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:46:57 oh good god
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:47:19 what
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:47:24 how does that get deleted
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:48:19 you can't acces the email or something?
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:49:13 rip
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 17:49:52 bye
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:00:19 i believe the bottom is mostly done
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:01:16 it looks very good, specially the hull shape
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:01:45 i don't know if you are gonna change it later but the deck colour is too bright
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:36:11 thx
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:40:05 a base of a crane for a project im working on
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:40:32 
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:42:15 here have some exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:42:29 yes this part is exposed
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:42:49 and this
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:42:55 on top of the main rope
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:43:17 congrats
creations-chat 2022-01-29 19:50:45 nice bot broke
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:52:02 technically if you make the build large enough exposed motorlock will blend in
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:52:22 so you don't need to worry about it
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:55:18 OH GOOD GOD
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 19:55:38 there are so many motors that it looks beautiful
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 09:28:54 the crane part is done
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 09:30:32 the best kind of lag machine
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 09:31:48 lag might actually be a problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 09:34:57 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 09:36:05 time for the 3rd account
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:22:29 just because of the "configure to edit" im giving it a downvote, it takes like 30 seconds to change it
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:15 i mean the fact that they don't change that one thing so obvious before posting it into creations tells me they don't even care about the build

don't get me wrong the build is beautiful and very well done
general 2022-01-30 20:31:15 stunning
the-dump 2022-01-30 20:37:56 a place where majority of the people are nice sounded off anyways
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:10 try making a truck
creations-chat 2022-01-31 18:00:45 i remember  seeing someone make that too but it could just be someone building the same thing
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:50:51 le foot
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:53:54 here is my reference picture
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:54:03 im a bit late to the contest
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:54:29 im not worrying about the studs much rn
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:54:53 i could do it once it is finished
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:55:25 do it, good for health 👍
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 10:57:25 so much effort
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 11:09:55 le foots
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 11:10:29 this backfired real fast
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 11:10:47 rude
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 14:51:02 making this out of squares is harder than i thought
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:12:44 legs
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:16:49 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 17:17:06 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:21:58 what about let that one player change servers
creations-chat 2022-02-02 08:52:36 next time you build one try to not make the arm stick out but it is too late for this one as it is near complete, put signs next to the explosives so the "explosives" text is gone, try to get rid of these 2 motors(image below),  make the afterburner a bit longer, motorlock another rocket infront or behind this rocket so it is longer which would look better(image below)

but it is a good jet, i like it
creations-chat 2022-02-02 09:05:40 anytime
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:49:16 i feel like legs are a tad bit too long
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:49:59 i have been looking at this for too long so im asking here if it is too long or not
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:51:23 alright
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:56:46 what about now
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:57:00 1 block shorter
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 12:57:41 very SUS of you to say that
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:00:27 what about now
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:01:14 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:02:56 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:10:06 they are gonna sue rick for letting people build mario
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:12:40 i am never posting anything here with just two legs and a body
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 13:14:34 there
creations-chat 2022-02-02 13:40:39 i honestly have no idea but it is happening so might as well join
creations-chat 2022-02-02 13:51:06 too late
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:08:50 people usually use trails to make afterburners here so you would need to use trails to make afterburners, the wings look like sticks so you would need to extend them back more, for details use signs to make warnings, random numbers military aircraft seem to have exc., there seems to be no vertical wing which makes it look weird but your design maybe doesn't have that so that's up to you

i would suggest to not improve on this plane but build more to improve on your building skills
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:09:14 people do anything to not give feedback here sadly
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:10:54 ok then don't talk about others builds because the moment you call them bad is the moment you need to give a feedback
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:11:09 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:12:02 i just don't get why it is so hard to be reasonable here
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:12:46 and what i hate most is people keep adding fuel to this fire
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 18:13:13 they don't say "actually i should not", they join them
the-dump 2022-02-02 18:19:46 i can listen to this all day
creations-chat 2022-02-02 20:08:56 it is the perfect time to flex your builds into peoples faces
creations-chat 2022-02-03 08:54:34 im telling you cats are devil and this is proof
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 12:13:29 what block is that?
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 12:13:32 
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 12:13:55 ooo
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 12:14:15 i forgot waterjet even existed
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 12:14:30 that is useful
creations-chat 2022-02-03 18:19:55 apart from the fact the colours are too bright, engines clipping trough the walls of the car, wheels not touching the floor, the fact that it can glide, lacking any detail, lacking any intakes, lacking any windows for the person sitting, that small bumpy part in the red line in front of the character

it is good
creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:13:04 i have the same question, it is the middle of night here
creations-chat 2022-02-03 21:15:11 Can there be one day in this server where everyone is chill, im going to bed
help 2022-02-04 09:17:59 either build something from in real life with every small detail or make something fictional with a ton and i mean a ton of detail or make something huge
creations-chat 2022-02-07 19:30:02 as i see it you are still learning how to build better in pc and that is a really good tiger for that stage in learning, you can do the basic model but it doesn't have any details. add stuff like shovels or random lines they for some reason have on them exc.
creations-chat 2022-02-07 20:22:57 holy this should not have this many upvotes, it was supposed to be just another glass build in the chain
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 20:24:41 i guess it does work
creations-chat 2022-02-07 20:25:24 this looks sick
creations-chat 2022-02-08 17:12:15 that is really creative
help 2022-02-09 14:25:42 p1000 ratte
help 2022-02-09 14:25:57 it is fairly big and still inside the plot
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:27:00 can you people take this to dms, there is no cooldown there and it will be better for the rest of us in this server
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:33:12 can't you people just not care about someone because you think their argument is invalid and not start an argument that seems to loop and loop with two people trying to get their point out while failing really bad at it
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:35:54 im convinced both of you are children now
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:38:36 the best thing you can do is not respond, if they don't get response to their feedback they will most likely leave, they will maybe send 3-5 more messages calling it "bad" in different ways
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:41:37 here is an advice: if you are fairly new to plane crazy ask for feedback in <#384021699466756107>  because as i see it people are nicer there, when you are building stuff that is becoming really complex post it here

people assume everyone is trying to get in hof here

also im gonna be honest i almost never ask feedback here, i just go with what my mind is telling me and it is usually faster
creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:49:46 if only hars built ( does hars still build? i never saw them post builds)
creations-chat 2022-02-10 18:25:34 is there a way to get rid of creations blacklist once you get it?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 16:28:57 i give up on mario, it started to annoy while building
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 16:29:30 the arms kept being too much forward, the legs were pain, neck is hell itself
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 16:30:17 i didn't even start the head or finish the arms and i don't even know if it would be finished by the time contest ends
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:05:23 that looks delicious but i still need to remember if i eat that i would gain an extra 20 kilograms in 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:05:55 yes i want but sadly can't
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:06:06 you can't eat pixels
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:06:34 give me a letter
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:07:16 make a really big tank that is made up
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:07:32 depends on what is big for you
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:08:26 big for a tank
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:08:36 like p1500
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:09:19 it looks normal to me
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:09:39 ah that explains it
help 2022-02-11 19:11:33 motorlock more wings inside so it has a lower stall speed or give it more speed
help 2022-02-11 19:12:01 if it pitches up or down automatically something is off balance
help 2022-02-11 19:20:48 what
help 2022-02-11 19:21:04 can you send a picture or a video?
help 2022-02-11 19:24:11 that is way too heavy for its wings
help 2022-02-11 19:24:25 that's the problem
help 2022-02-11 19:25:16 when putting a wing it needs to be wide so you don't start spinning and long so you don't fall out of the sky
help 2022-02-11 19:25:45 and needs to have a good balance with the build, not too small or too big
help 2022-02-11 19:25:55 yours is too small
help 2022-02-11 19:27:55 you can motorlock wings at certain places to balance everything while keeping the shape or adding more wings outside, ruining the builds look
help 2022-02-11 19:28:38 if you can't motorlock the plane irs gonna get ruined with the looks or you build a new considering the wings this time
help 2022-02-11 19:28:53 yes
help 2022-02-11 19:30:10 yes better
help 2022-02-11 19:32:19 can someone else help them im busy
bug-reports 2022-02-12 14:47:38 rude
creations-chat 2022-02-12 20:24:42 i can't upvote it, im sad now
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 09:20:16 i now realise this is not centered
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 09:22:27 what is fabric
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 09:23:15 makes sense
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:41:23 you could make the hull smoother, the deck is brighter than the hull which makes it look weird and i feel like it is a tad bit too wide but im not sure

overall a good build
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:44:37 i think there is reflection and if there is no reflection the colours are pretty close
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:02:41 they hapi :D
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:19:35 i see why they want this but there is skill that separates players and this removes some of the skill needed
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:22:05 if you want to, none of us are gonna put pressure on you except some idiots in creation feedback
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:23:34 people assume that everyone no matter their skill level or time spent in game has the ability to make hof creations
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:24:26 i do support the upvote and downvotes having a difference of like 100 to -70
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:29:41 you are right about that, you can make very good builds but motorlock just helps
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:34:23 motorlock does help with the build but at one point the build starts to get so complex it becomes more difficult to place motorlock, this is where you start to have trouble, if you are not experienced this would become really hard fast, if you have experience it wouldn't be that big of a deal even tho you will have some trouble. that is the difference
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:35:07 good
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:36:19 no motorlock is not low effort you can still make good builds, people that say so probably don't know what they are talking about much
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:37:25 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:48:49 it is a masterpiece
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 16:49:20 technically it can be a boat
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 19:09:34 i love it
general 2022-02-16 19:12:46 i confirm
general 2022-02-16 19:13:11 ok bye, i didn't even know you existed before these messages
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 19:16:20 why not

creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:05:53 pls try to be more polite when correcting someone next time and try to tell them straight away rather than "how in the world do u look at a plane and say china". also none of us here have perfect english we all make mistakes, just ignore the mistakes we make
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:08:09 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:14:13 <@!595671478666657802> good looking plane, i like the shape and all but you made the windows too bright making the build look worse by getting the attention to windows only. the missiles look a bit wonky, you could make custom ones but that is up to you. there are no details which is probably the main reason it is gonna get a lot of downvotes ( by details i mean signs saying random stuff and random numbers vehicles seem to have on them, specially military ones. the weird sticking out parts they seem to have exc. )

overall i say it is fine but can be improved
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:16:28 anytime
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 05:01:13 interesting
help 2022-02-18 05:06:48 bruh
creations-chat 2022-02-18 09:24:05 i would suggest giving the camo lighter difference in colour, you can't understand or see much of the detail because of it
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:22:52 i don't know how i can give feedback to that as the back looks almost nothing like the real one, no offense. maybe try using wedges and stuff to get the shape going?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:25:18 you said 1960 yourself and im no car expert, anyways moving on
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:28:11 btw the back doesn't have too much angle, you can just do this
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:31:09 it is not a car but you can make 1947 chevrolet 3100 series, has a fair amount of shapes to look good in a build
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:34:02 if they want to move on they can move on, no one is holding them
help 2022-02-19 13:40:11 maybe like this
help 2022-02-19 13:40:46 you can use motorlock to make the motor centered
help 2022-02-19 13:43:09 
help 2022-02-19 13:43:40 it would be hard to make it smooth without motorlock
help 2022-02-19 13:43:58 ima do some motorlocking brb
help 2022-02-19 13:52:14 this is way harder than i thought, im gonna go continue what i was doing
creations-chat 2022-02-19 13:53:25 police shark
help 2022-02-19 18:02:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:12:28 its still not over bruh
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:22:37 you can use trails for the barrels and it looks too wide, maybe try to make it half block wide each but it would take a lot of time to do that
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:23:36 oh i see
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:25:17 you are not alone, there are some great people but the crap people are more than usual
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:26:27 the reason someone asks for advice is they need help on something, telling them to try again or something in those lines doesn't help
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:28:15 lets not turn this to a heated argument
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:28:51 alright then please tell them how
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:29:42 here is the image
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:34:47 honestly i almost never posted builds here or asked for stuff for one and a half years or more and i would be crap at building if i did ask for feedback, that is how bad feedback is
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:35:45 you could motorlock these parts inside the hull so there are no holes
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:36:06 you can make a good afterburner with trails, making them long or shorter to make it look like fire
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:36:27 im still working on that
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:37:04 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:37:14 it is gonna be a big build hopefully
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:37:34 alt accounts

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:38:37 i wouldn't risk it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:38:59 the build is ruined now
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:39:08 how could you
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:41:03 sry for late response, just rejoin and you should be fine
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:41:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:41:38 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:41:56 i got so many builds in my account, not risking it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:42:20 maybe i should post some of them in creations, i only posted sr 71 and p1500
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:42:37 give me a letter

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:50:28 im fine with it if it doesn't go in hof
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:51:19 honestly upvotes doesn't mean much, everyone can get the same amount with more or less skill, the only flex now if being in hof
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:55:20 then what happens to the food? do you just keep the waste inside or does it all become urine?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:56:11 that makes sense now

creations-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:40 looks good, maybe add an anchor too
creations-chat 2022-02-21 09:16:01 that looks awesome, i don't know what else you can add. maybe dirt on the vehicle? but i think that is going too far
help 2022-02-21 18:03:09 bruh don't ping all of them
help 2022-02-21 18:03:35 you are just making yourself look worse by pinging all of them

creations-chat 2022-02-25 15:35:22 look they are trying their best at building a plane

i was not trying to be rude or anything, why did you have to call me an idiot
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 16:27:04 hmm yes i see

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:00:31 nope
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:01:03 i could piston lock but im simply too lazy to do that
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:02:27 tall boi

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:23:45 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:33:04 glass is extremely sharp
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 16:34:35 who needs a knife anyways
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:43:45 but it does have 100% guarantee of a place in hof, i say it is worth it
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:45:52 actually you are right, it would take 2 plots at most to build this
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:50:28 and that is seeds for an argument, im not getting involved in this goodbye
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:06:59 im happy with this front
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:07:26 i still have stuff to add
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:07:45 you
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:08:18 you said go to creations and wip builds are not allowed in creations, that means you wanted me to post it assuming i finished it, i clarified
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:09:25 can you people chill a bit, we are all not gaining anything from this
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:10:24 for cameralock?
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:13:17 i don't know the original but this is good for toxicity
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:17:26 gentleman, we chat
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:24:33 so, im going to add another long boi next to this but as of rn there are three accounts, one is the front one is the middle and the other the back. Im trying to make a moving artilery gun. Is there anything i should change before moving on?(i didn't open all 3 at once yet that's why there are 2 different pictures)
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:26:37 looks neat, small but fancy
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:33:15 try using darker colours, they blend in with the other grey parts and use some rough material like slate or fabric
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:35:18 wait how did i not notice that, im blind
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:37:32 sick
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:41:38 it is not that bad honestly
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:44:04 it is a good build in my standards but you can have a different opinion about it, i think it is shaped fairly good not making it look like random wedges hardly resembling even a car
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:53:34 it is a place to chat, to find some peace...
hopefully
creations-chat 2022-03-09 20:18:09 rip to that person anyways moving on
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:10:16 im guessing that is one block wide, you can either make it wider or make it shorter, it looks a tad bit too tall
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:16:32 they are trying their best and that is all that matters
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:24:18 idk about the colour but you could add some text on the drone for some detail, like the "WARNING" or those long texts, batteries for some reason always have them <@!791000572286992435>
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:31:41 <@!780574146919792700>  <@!714878625484243101>  you people are not helping.
<@456226577798135808> you could cover the bomb with half blocks so the explosives are not visible. It needs some paint, even the simplest paint design would help a ton. One of the planes have a engine on the back side, they usually don't have that. If you put that for speed just hide one inside the hull. the wings could use some work, they need to be wider (i think), it would help a lot if you gave a top down view of both of them. The overall shape of the hull would be really hard to change so i would suggest trying to do another one but you can still improve the ones you built.

im guessing you just started playing so this is a good plane for starting out.
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:34:33 this.
you need to say this.

You know how the game works, you played it a lot and have more experience so stop trying get people out of the game by calling their builds bad or telling them to rebuild.
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:38:26 <@!714878625484243101> i would suggest just not making it worse if you can't help, sorry if that sounded rude.

also <@!738064035135750224>  that is a beautiful build, only thing i would suggest is next time try making it more round

ah i see
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:41:15 yeah, vibe in general and stuff
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:44:09 bruh
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:54:59 don't worry about it, it is best to not care
creations-chat 2022-03-11 17:12:06 very nice
creations-chat 2022-03-11 17:21:22 lets not escalate this
creations-chat 2022-03-11 17:24:03 we just need people to understand not everything is a big deal and slowmode is gone
creations-chat 2022-03-11 17:26:59 some textures to it, like dirt and the metals lower to the ground slate
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:31:34 what is happening
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:33:37 i have no idea what is the argument but i agree with hars, no one will gain anything or care after this argument
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:41:36 the wings have holes in them. (im guessing you are the creator of the build) you tried to make a camo but the blocky texture makes it looks worse, if you can't do smooth ones with wedges and motorlock stick with one colour paints. Some parts can be smoother but i will understand if you don't want to do that, it takes a lot of time and most of the time not worth it if you are not going for hof build. the glass could be a darker colour, planes usually don't have a white window. The intakes seem to be too small, for me at least.

Overall i like the build but it could be improved.
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:44:39 <@!934150235435958283> here have some feedback
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:47:22 guys can we stop
creations-chat 2022-03-12 13:00:44 Awac revolution
creations-chat 2022-03-12 18:13:53 epic fail
creations-chat 2022-03-12 18:23:05 i suggest putting your character at the back because the arms stick out. You can add afterburners to it and maybe some missiles. Perhaps some details with signs ( "WARNING" ,labels exc.). I don't have much to say it is a pretty good build.
creations-chat 2022-03-13 10:11:07 Yes
creations-chat 2022-03-13 15:36:08 noooo
creations-chat 2022-03-13 17:28:49 it didn't get upvotes downvotes again
creations-chat 2022-03-14 18:01:50 how do you even measure that, is it the time taken to spawn it or building it. If it is spawning you are doing something wrong. If it is building that didn't take much time to build
creations-chat 2022-03-19 09:21:07 i think it looks pretty cool, lots of effort
i feel bad it got so many downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 08:46:37 uhm

creations-chat 2022-04-02 21:24:20 well if they said it is better because it has a lot of motorlock we call them by technical terms "idiots", it is a different story if they mean the detail when spawned

alr, i Just wanted to write one sentence rather than 10 messages
creations-chat 2022-04-03 08:56:03 i don't have a problem with it, it is better than some other builds in creations so it deserves an upvote
creations-chat 2022-04-03 09:01:54 i agree with that
creations-chat 2022-04-04 19:36:43 giant stuff are much better no matter if it is an aircraft a tank or whatever else it can be
i agree
creations-chat 2022-04-04 19:41:20 i do understand that but you can make large builds look better, don't get me wrong roscales look amazing and has a lot of attention to it but it can only go to a certain extend before it is over detailed or it is nothing like the build before

i meant it as "to the point where it is just bad"

i don't have an example tbh, i didn't see anyone cross that line yet but they always end up in the same detail or a little lower
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:36:10 i never thought of adding chains on my builds, this gives me good ideas
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:39:36 listen to hars if you are trying to get in hof, otherwise they are not going to help

i have no clue, i just came in to say "good chains" <@!809781295500099584>
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:59:05 i mean i didn't get an expert terrain specialist because i was not proud of the build, i have the votes but it doesn't feel right
bot-central 2022-04-17 11:19:26 -servers
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:56:48 put a block where the motor needs to stop, there is no way to edit the motor
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:59:36 i don't see a problem. it is going to be flying anyways, not a car
i don't care about the gears much while building jets, i just put the 1x2 ones and it works
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:01:50 yeah, just fix the other stuff and if it bugs you a lot in the end fix it
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:04:33 you should probably edit the 2 pictures out
creations-chat 2022-04-24 08:06:41 ok that is just awesome
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:31:26 i should just leave this server to be honest, there are so many 9 year olds trying to sound smart or raging on people because they got nothing to do in their so called lifes.
And now im guessing they are going to tell me "oh im 15/17/19/14 lol what are you on about? "
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:31:58 i think you can improve on the bridge, the hull looks solid and good but the windows look blocky, you could use wings and piston lock to give it some better "sticks"

You are the one that built the triple e right?

The windows on the bridge have blocks in the middle to seperate them which makes it look bad. You can instead pistonlock wings in the middle. Wings are much thinner and look a thousand times better
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:38:10 im right now on Phone i can't, you can ask others to help with that
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:46:12 getting into hall of fame is just a fun challange, if you want to you can put the effort and time
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:49:01 if the build it big enough people can't even see the details clearly so you can do whatever you want without worrying about it much, for example this
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:52:02 standards didn't change much honestly, people did get better at building but you can still enter hof with 2020s standards
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:53:54 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:57:30 i do agree you need a lot of skill to get in hof but it is still possible without the skill, you just need to go nuts with whatever you are making
making a building? make it five buildings
making a tank? make a giant one instead
exc.
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:05:47 overlocking is never overlocking
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:06:39 you can cover the entire plot if you want to, if the lock works it works you can't overlock something
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:07:02 motorlock wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:07:05 it is what i do
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:07:51 actually you are right about that
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:15:48 triangles
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:17:11 going to go next to these 3
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:17:40 i kept taking brakes about this project because of real life stuff
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:17:43 it has been a year now
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:18:22 i don't use this server much because of toxicity and stuff, i only posted a few of my builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:18:33 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:19:02 some are toxic to newbies, i just don't like it
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:19:19 i come here now and then but not much
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:19:37 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:19:54 im going to post this one tho, it took way too long
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:20:18 good luck with that
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:20:22 a lot of angles
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:22:03 well custom mechs are not that hard, you can just say it is a part of your build but when building from a picture you can't say that
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:22:06 mechs are complex
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:22:34 i never managed to get a leg working
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:22:40 i stick with land stuff because of that
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 14:31:19 according to plane crazy rules this thing can fly as good as any other plane
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:34:13 people are toxic in here to newbies, i suggest just not being around here

even better just get out, they don't even give advice
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:37:09 that should be a thing in every community but that shouldn't mean "you have to be toxic to newbies"
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:54:59 very cool build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 15:07:26 it just got posted
creations-chat 2022-05-02 15:12:17 after a day you can judge it, right now you just have to wait
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:04:26 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:05:03 like this is 10k blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:05:28 interesting
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:06:28 you really need to sleep
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:02:54 probably was the best for them to leave if they couldn't handle it
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 13:00:58 when did that happen
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 13:15:56 well that turned into a nightmare fuel
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:01:44 <@410455661814480896> can you tell me the problem so i can fix it on future builds?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:11:00 you are really not helping here
creations-chat 2022-05-03 16:49:28 alr i will try to make the nose and the windows better next time i build a jet or anything in those lines.
Just be more polite next time
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:20:50 the pain of using alts
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:40:26 helps a lot in big builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:41:13 wait is it removed?
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:41:31 oh i see
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:41:48 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:42:08 i think you can still find good audio for sound effects and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:42:14 but i never tried after the update
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:44:29 i was talking about builds like this where stuff is inside each other
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 20:45:25 you can't really tower up because there is no good space for it
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 21:08:13 i literally just left roblox and it is hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 21:08:31 let me see if i can find a pic
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 21:09:12 
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 21:09:32 im heading off to sleep now ok bye
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:00:43 after building with motorlock a lot you start to see it instantly if one is outside the build
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:18:26 dude 2ypes just pointed out a flaw, it is not that a big deal
<@456226577798135808> this tpurple person is trying to prove that 2ypes is wrong for pointing out an obvious flaw
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:26:13 yay it is back to normal
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:28:04 i mean you didn't start the argument, why should you get muted?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 09:15:25 do signs work?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 09:20:55 sad
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 09:24:18 it is a gamble with no reward
bug-reports 2022-05-04 12:07:20 is this an old screenshot or did you take it just now?
bug-reports 2022-05-04 12:07:53 roblox is having problems right now, i suggest not joining any games
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:50:56 Hars is the best person to judge you if you are going for hof, they see trough everything
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:46:24 yeah almost like they need to learn and take their time with some builds and have breaks you know?
bug-reports 2022-05-04 19:35:05 i noticed but thanks for letting me know
creations-chat 2022-05-05 11:54:47 very nice
creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:01:03 Are you just spamming them for fun or actually building something
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:41:41 progress
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:41:59 big gun
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:45:03 2 accounts
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:45:32 im finished with 3 of them this is the forth and the final one i need to complete
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:45:51 and i love it for that
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:46:03 it is a braindead build but it is really fun to build
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:54:05 you can run two clients at once in one device
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:54:13 so you can use two accounts at once
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:54:29 oh it doesn't
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 18:55:08 they do move as alone but would be hard to do when they are together
creations-chat 2022-05-06 14:42:24 it could be a real build, the normal base has conveyer belts behind it also you can see the blue trails

could just be photoshopped too idk
creations-chat 2022-05-06 14:49:33 i think yousuf did a mistake then, they have blacklist now
creations-chat 2022-05-06 16:27:27 ~~the build is way too good~~ the real thing is way too simple

it is original unlike most of creations
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:30:15 i believe everything is done, i just need to get all 4 accounts logged at once and take some screenshots
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:30:39 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:31:03 it does look weird not gonna lie
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:31:55 it was mostly braindead building so i won't be surprised if it was not
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:32:41 it is like lifting a whole building if you think about it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:33:16 yes but it is ugly when shooting
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:33:20 i need to change the black smoke
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:34:32 im not going to post the screenshot of it shooting in creations since the pistons on the 2 triangle grey thingy are supposed to look like they are going to retreact when it shoots but they don't
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:34:40 also the rope on the crane doesn't act like a rope
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:34:48 it is just gonna look weird
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:35:06 ah yes
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:36:31 i have to agree with you on that
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:37:22 jokes aside that is such a cool costume
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:37:41 because i asked people on discord what the size should be and here we are
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 18:38:09 burn an entire forest by walking
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:29:17 giving feedback to someone changes with how long that person has been playing this game and how good is their skill
you can't treat a week old player like you treat someone trying to enter hof. you can't just point out things and expect a week old player to fix it, you have to explain them how to fix it.

<@738064035135750224> thank you too for the compliment!
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:34:18 good for you. you can give good feedback to experienced people if they take it seriously or not but not the new ones
creations-chat 2022-05-06 20:01:48 and can't upvote great
help 2022-05-07 08:45:53 there is no way to fix it at the moment
creations-chat 2022-05-08 13:26:41 i do like the tank but can they Just stop reposting it, we get that it looks good we saw it already
creations-chat 2022-05-09 14:21:37 you could cover the holes in your wings by motorlocking some wing panels, you would need to balance the plane again but it would look better. the colours seem too light, try darker tons of them. you can use trails to make some good afterburners but it is not necessary. maybe add missiles and bombs under the wings but that is up to you
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:26:15 i really like the idea of the radar and engines being like that but i think it shouldn't be for robux or a thing you find around the map
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:27:30 i mean it is a necessary thing to have, better just give it to the player it is like finding a motor around the map
creations-chat 2022-05-12 20:16:18 jesus that is complicated
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 09:58:52 how did this get so many upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 09:59:21 that is a cool build
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 10:00:28 there were still really good builds, it is not like it was really good at the time
creations-chat 2022-05-14 21:52:23 when that one motorlock clips with a normal motor
creations-chat 2022-05-16 20:53:15 a lot of the people probably downvoted for the exposed motorlock
other than that the missiles are at an odd place and the back side just looks blocky
creations-chat 2022-05-17 16:32:40 i agree 150 is a good spot

hof is for the people that are putting way too much effort in a single build, it is supposed to be hard
creations-chat 2022-05-17 17:41:39 wait was that the yellow name guy that kept arguing about builds?
help 2022-05-17 17:43:30 they are way too heavy
help 2022-05-17 17:43:56 did you put just one or multiple?
creations-chat 2022-05-17 17:45:07 you are right
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:16:19 i just came here and nope im not dealing with this bye
contest-chat 2022-05-19 10:54:33 we have a winner gentleman
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 12:18:26 im so happy with the afterburners
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 12:19:49 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 12:20:46 make the black colour a bit lighter, like 60 60 60
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 12:21:34 you can also add some text that planes have on them, or random arrows they seem to have but that is up to you
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 12:32:34 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 13:07:35 how does the build mode look like?
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 13:10:15 that is very well done
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:51:23 oh hey the cooldown is 1 minute and 40 seconds now
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 13:37:13 looks like a pretty fun thing to build ngl
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:22:25 excuse me what
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:22:51 that doesn't have that much effort how did it get more upvotes than any of my builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:23:49 i mean the front is just messed up
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:24:10 it looks like a drill
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:24:29 i guess i shouldn't be complaining
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 15:24:39 i will tell a mod to submit this to hof
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:20:22 it is finally finished

now i will ask for feedback as what i could do if something is horribly and i mean horribly wrong
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:23:12 thank you for the feedback, i will work more on the colours in my other builds then

i started it 2 years ago but because of real life stuff it took way longer than it should, i think it would be 4 months if we forget about real life <@652341016510201856>
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:26:41 i mean sometimes you just forget the most obvious thing while building
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:29:09 i just did it and it took an hour and a half

alr ima post this in creations, there seems to be no obvious flaws on it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:35:40 the votes failed :/

thx yousuf for fixing it

i honestly didn't check it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:37:53 it is perspective, the whole build is a lie (real)

<@464259154916147211> 51k blocks
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:41:06 it is all in ruins, what a garbage creation
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:43:23 you are correct, yes it did take long but shows no sign of skill yet people see it and instantly like it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:45:26 in my book it is not a thing that takes skill, a thing that takes skill is something in the lines of this which i cannot do yet

also thanks for the feedback, i will look out to fix those on later builds

large builds are mindless block spams most of the time, there is one part that confuses and that is figuring out how to make it that large
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:49:40 there is actually ammo inside, the big bright green thing inside is that, i probably should have put some black stuff inside to make it look powdered
it does shoot i just forgot to take photos of it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:52:30 yes
for most of the build it is just that

<@853042393309904897> i wanted it to be a tank
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:55:59 it is the same size but the front has been bugging me with the mig
idk i never saw hars jet in person or compared it

the difference is that one hell lot of angles you need to make just to progress a single block
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:58:22 yep i missed a spot there
these are made with alts, it is hard for me to compare all at once
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:17:00 thank you
4 months if you forget about other real life stuff that doesn't include sleeping
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:20:58 it is only a few people that keep coming here and starting to talk crap to builds
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:29:12 i think that jet deserved it, looks really cool
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:32:51 they are not that obvious, it looks cool and that is what matters
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:35:45 wow
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:47:11 i know you are asking rbk but the suspension for the landing gear could be lowered, they look way too high and the ruder needs more angle to the back
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:59:58 i simply made it up while building
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:14:08 i have no idea what it is, it was first a tank with big gun then slowly it turned to a stationary gun but it is still able to move
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:19:39 they had fair points and feedback
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 12:58:27 well that ended up well
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:00:15 this
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:00:43 it is a gun and that is the only thing i know
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:05:57 it is definitely heavy
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:07:38 a meter cube of metal is 480kg and the builds is made out of 51k blocks so if we remove wings and such it would be about 21.600 tons
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:08:57 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:09:09 i don't think this will end up in hof but we will see how it goes
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:09:52 i made it up as i went
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 13:10:38 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:28:58 mods are not online 24/7 and i believe people don't report arguments until way later
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:33:26 they could hire mods that are more active but i bet that is not happening until pcc 2 comes
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 18:35:52 am i the only one seeing this after roblox updated
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 18:36:10 it is stuck like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 18:40:24 i deleted roblox how is it opening the program
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:33:08 Can someone send a photo of the build here?

I can see why people were suspicious that thing is so good
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:37:16 i think because of the nose cone being perfect it looked out of the game for some people
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:46:30 yeah it is easy to prove if it is real unless it is fake
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:00:03 oh they back
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:04:06 <@702907851001167882> nvm i got confused
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:46:54 if you want to have fun do not talk in creations chat, some people take stuff way too seriously
i improved myself without this server and it helped a lot
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:20:24 send it as one message next time

or edit if you want to add more info to it
