general 2020-05-17 19:18:16 breakthrough discovery made!
general 2020-05-17 19:18:20 oh yeah!
general 2020-05-17 19:18:40 new technologies from discoveries: auto angling
general 2020-05-17 19:28:15 Ah yes, the autoloader used commonly on Soviet MBT's.
general 2020-05-17 19:34:08 Guys! I really did it!
general 2020-05-17 19:34:17 I really made a 1x7 wedge in Plane Crazy!
general 2020-05-17 19:34:35 It's not even motor angled!
general 2020-05-17 19:34:45 It's a special and new trick!
general 2020-05-17 19:49:02 How?
general 2020-05-17 19:49:18 The blocks are clipping together
general 2020-05-17 19:49:20 Impossible.
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:58:45 Good, good.
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:58:54 They're blaming it on motor lock.
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:59:15 <@!340543153922768906> How do you do that?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 20:10:47 Very odd discoveries!
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 20:11:13 However they have high potential to be as revolutionary as motor lock.
general 2020-05-17 20:14:50 There is always bacteria in water.
general 2020-05-17 20:15:07 There is no water body on this planet without about microorganisms.
general 2020-05-17 20:15:10 Oh?
general 2020-05-17 20:15:20 They still do have a presence in water.
general 2020-05-17 20:15:25 Any water that is
general 2020-05-17 20:15:38 Actually on reconsideration
general 2020-05-17 20:15:50 The chlorine in most treated water probably kills them off.
general 2020-05-17 20:16:14 A nearby water treatment plant.
general 2020-05-17 20:16:26 Usually there is fluorine and chlorine inside your water.
general 2020-05-17 20:16:42 If your town has lead plumbing, it may have minerals to stop the corrosion of the pipes.
general 2020-05-17 20:17:11 Pipelines are pretty long...
general 2020-05-17 20:17:35 The water will be pumped into nearby water towers then supplied to you.
general 2020-05-17 20:17:41 Hm?
general 2020-05-17 20:18:16 Water will find its way to a population centre, no matter what.
general 2020-05-17 20:18:49 I have the luxury of high water pressure and boiling temperatures as I live in a pretty big apartment complex.
general 2020-05-17 20:19:13 A low estimate would be
general 2020-05-17 20:19:17 1056 homes.
general 2020-05-17 20:20:26 I believe if I cut open the main pipe for the floor, the water pressure can cut through my flesh.
general 2020-05-17 20:21:03 My block has 3 towers
general 2020-05-17 20:21:09 and 2 swimming pols
general 2020-05-17 20:21:11 pools
general 2020-05-17 20:22:17 In Asia, apartment complexes have many appeals as it is cheap and safe housing in a crowded city.
general 2020-05-17 20:23:02 My country is seeing a boom in the construction industry.
general 2020-05-17 20:23:31 A new apartment complex with 3 to 8 towers and 25+ floors is popping up every year.
general 2020-05-17 20:24:32 What country do you live in?
general 2020-05-17 20:26:32 As my nation is a developing one, we're seeing a lot of growth in the past years.
general 2020-05-17 20:26:52 SInce I'm in the upper middle class, I benefit from this majorly.
general 2020-05-17 20:27:41 I believe the US is falling apart.
general 2020-05-17 20:28:07 Asian cities are much more efficient than US cities.
general 2020-05-17 20:28:28 I went to Tokyo once.
general 2020-05-17 20:28:40 It was very dense but everything was so neat and uniform.
general 2020-05-17 20:29:04 China is overtaking the US as the global military superpower and economic leader.
general 2020-05-17 20:31:21 I have heard that Russia is using the current pandemic to conduct operations in Eastern Ukraine.
general 2020-05-17 20:31:54 No.
general 2020-05-17 20:32:07 Statement from conscript inside the Russian Army
general 2020-05-17 20:32:26 An old friend of mine.
general 2020-05-17 20:32:40 I think he works in the army professionally now.
general 2020-05-17 20:36:53 I think you need 4k hours to complete a tech tree without paying in War Thunder.
general 2020-05-17 20:37:03 I heard the grind is pretty awful.
general 2020-05-17 20:45:07 It’s a better SPAA than the Wirbelwind.

plane-crazy 2020-06-25 11:52:31 Why is motor 2 so inconsistent?
plane-crazy 2020-06-25 11:52:49 Why can we set which part follows the mouse and not have it be automatically decided?
general 2020-06-25 11:55:05 Yousuf is modlog farming
general 2020-06-25 11:55:18 he will warn for the smallest molecule of offense
general 2020-06-25 11:59:30 In my opinion, Rickje is an incompetent developer

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:43:51 Is this even a UAV
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:43:57 you're sitting in it
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:45:35 Cruising at 1.2k is a simple task
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:46:07 but having accurate and reliable manoeuvring at that speed is a challenging and practical task
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:46:16 You don't even need a complex hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:46:19 or a big one
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:19 mouse aim?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:26 bye
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:51:31 I admire pilots who fly purely on WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:51:36 insane skill
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:52:00 but technology has progressed and mouse aim planes are more effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:52:10 uh
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:52:14 barely is still something
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:52:49 Does it shoot other planes down?
general 2021-05-27 18:53:26 looks like shid
general 2021-05-27 18:54:06 The A-10 looks like a plane
general 2021-05-27 18:55:11 It looks good
general 2021-05-27 18:55:13 because it's unique
general 2021-05-27 18:55:23 and not just a mutated and disfigured A-10
general 2021-05-27 18:55:54 You can clearly see the resemblance
general 2021-05-27 18:57:17 denial
general 2021-05-27 18:59:06 Have we seen and recent developments of ATGM carriers in the west
general 2021-05-27 19:02:17 Ask the people here if the A-14 looks like the A-10
general 2021-05-27 19:02:18 go on
general 2021-05-27 19:03:01 I've looked at myself
general 2021-05-27 19:03:06 I'm asking you to look at others
general 2021-05-27 19:04:35 double barrel shotguns?
general 2021-05-27 19:04:47 they don't refer to them like they refer to pants
general 2021-05-27 19:04:57 Yes
general 2021-05-27 19:05:24 Your definition is flawed then
general 2021-05-27 19:05:38 it is more practical to refer to it as one single gun
general 2021-05-27 19:05:59 because it's one single collection of mechanisms that allow it to fire
general 2021-05-27 19:06:33 I stopped talking to you 5 minutes ago, weirdo
general 2021-05-27 19:06:57 No, there are two revolving mechanisms
general 2021-05-27 19:06:59 so two revolvers
general 2021-05-27 19:07:01 but one gun
general 2021-05-27 19:07:27 weirdo
general 2021-05-27 19:07:27 Okay
general 2021-05-27 19:07:54 Are the two shotguns bound together into one collection of mechanisms?
general 2021-05-27 19:08:01 then yes, it is one single gun
general 2021-05-27 19:08:12 you're 12
general 2021-05-27 19:08:43 I don't trust americans on their gun classifications

general 2021-05-27 19:09:21 Muh SBRs!!!! Banned!!!
general 2021-05-27 19:11:40 If its in one piece then its one gun
general 2021-05-27 19:11:45 if the two parts are mechanically dependant
general 2021-05-27 19:13:10 > safely
general 2021-05-27 19:14:50 It's illegal to get a gun here
general 2021-05-27 19:15:01 but I really want one for recreational and entertainment purposes

general 2021-05-27 19:21:37 so its one gun
general 2021-05-27 19:22:19 They're interconnected by a mechanism (the trigger) into one unit
general 2021-05-27 19:22:22 so its one gun
general 2021-05-27 19:22:54 Yes

general 2021-05-27 19:23:47 You're only connecting the paths on the mountains
general 2021-05-27 19:24:11 The trigger is a part of the gun
general 2021-05-27 19:24:38 It is essential to the gun's function

general 2021-06-22 16:45:12 *
general 2021-06-22 16:45:26 Is this ingame helium or real life helium
general 2021-06-22 16:47:43 <@!216193164199985152> I tested it
general 2021-06-22 16:47:46 helium blocks have mass
general 2021-06-22 16:48:04 when I added it to the end of a spinning thing it increased the moment of inertia and the acceleration was slower
general 2021-06-22 16:49:53 he's based?

general 2021-06-22 17:41:06 rather complicated
general 2021-06-22 17:44:06 should I shorten the hull
general 2021-06-22 17:44:19 
general 2021-06-22 17:44:24 should I shorten the hull or lengthen the turret
general 2021-06-22 17:44:46 triangle wedges

plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:17:04 final version before painting
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:17:53 it's the temporary colours of the sideskirt
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:18:32 it has a log in the back
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:18:43 plus the IS-7 was a prototype only
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:18:45 no log :/
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:19:03 though I think I can take some creative liberties and add a log
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:19:24 actually I think it will be better to remain accurate
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:23:09 https://i.gyazo.com/196a01566fc196ce506fdf93280f3bea.mp4
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:25:32 the is-7 is a pretty low detail tank
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:25:47 other than some tools and cables
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:25:53 but it doesn't really add detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:26:10 
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:26:12 by nature it's low detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:26:15 <@!719168864705052802>
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:29:15 more details?
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:29:26 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:29:34 driver's visors are impossible
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:29:35 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:29:40 unless I try really hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:30:57 the most i'll put is a few stickers
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:35:43 I suppose this is better <@!719168864705052802> ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 18:36:06 if I paint it the details will be clearer

general 2021-06-28 17:52:52 Real
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 17:54:38 In theory the optimum time to post a build would be 5 am EDT
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 17:55:20 1. The americans are waking up, they will see your build but won't push it up as nobody builds in the morning
2. The asians just came home from school, they will log on and see your build
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 17:55:27 nobody cares about europeans
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 18:00:58 What about the actual data
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 18:01:10 which time period yields the most exposure to your builds?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 18:02:18 isn't this the world lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:14 the T-72B3 turret is up there as one of the hardest things to build without 200 million motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:34 I suppose you can angle the wedges
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:38 in a radial form
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:50 you can do it by camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:57 it probably takes like 8 cameras

general 2021-07-02 17:54:19 it's probably slightly too big

the-dump 2021-07-16 13:37:51 no it's been like that since the start
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:39:01 the only worth while rank is designer
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:39:35 anyone without a designer IV or above is assumed to be either bad at building or lazy to apply for ranks
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:40:03 ye and you can get another other ranks with a shitty build

the-dump 2021-07-16 13:49:29 is the upvote red or orange
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:49:41 yeah that's what I told him
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:50:01 and I said that building like that won't get him anywhere
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:50:11 so he turned belligerent
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:50:20 as he viewed it as an insult
the-dump 2021-07-16 13:54:08 I suppose the matter has been settled

general 2021-07-29 09:37:34 discord just dumb
general 2021-07-29 09:38:01 yes
general 2021-07-29 13:22:31 the paint is bad
general 2021-07-29 13:22:48 I agree
general 2021-07-29 13:22:55 da hars downvotes everything
general 2021-07-29 13:23:23 basically everything
general 2021-07-29 13:23:29 enough that it counts as everything

general 2021-07-29 13:25:33 real
general 2021-07-29 13:26:25 Da_hars' downvoting is justifiable because he has pretty good builds
general 2021-07-29 13:30:22 I'm going to build a vva-14
general 2021-07-29 13:30:25 any suggestions?
general 2021-07-29 13:33:59 send me channel link
general 2021-07-29 13:34:57 wtf
general 2021-07-29 13:34:59 that kinda sucks ngl
general 2021-07-29 13:35:02 only the front is detailed
general 2021-07-29 13:35:13 rest is
general 2021-07-29 13:35:15 dumb
general 2021-07-29 13:35:17 and stupid
general 2021-07-29 13:38:02 yo rate my new build 😎
general 2021-07-29 13:38:37 bye
general 2021-07-29 13:38:37 ok nagatoro just complaining now
general 2021-07-29 13:41:41 the volumetric shell update ruined war thunder
general 2021-07-29 13:42:42 Which variant of the VVA-14 should I make
general 2021-07-29 13:43:57 I think you can overpressure by shooting the turret ring
general 2021-07-29 13:44:09 idk I quit before it became shit
general 2021-07-29 13:44:30 there's enough of a seal there to stop the blast pressure
general 2021-07-29 13:44:58 plus overpressure insta-killing makes no sense
general 2021-07-29 13:47:09 Depleted Uranium?
general 2021-07-29 13:47:26 if you breathe in the dust it fucks up your lungs
general 2021-07-29 13:47:56 try coughing out metal particulates
general 2021-07-29 13:48:16 plus you'll breathe it in without feeling it
general 2021-07-29 13:48:32 people don't just cough out asbestos and survive
general 2021-07-29 13:48:58 What does that have in relation
general 2021-07-29 13:49:34 irrelevant
general 2021-07-29 13:50:08 Yes but we're talking about breathing in dangerous materials
general 2021-07-29 13:50:15 man made materials
general 2021-07-29 13:50:21 biological threats have no relation to this
general 2021-07-29 13:50:32 Seen
general 2021-07-29 13:50:56 Yes
general 2021-07-29 13:50:59 your point being?
general 2021-07-29 13:51:21 What does coughing do
general 2021-07-29 13:51:32 the metal particulate still enters your lungs and you can still die
general 2021-07-29 13:51:47 we're talking about the lethality of airborne uranium dust
general 2021-07-29 13:52:10 I assumed you said that because you said people will cough it out before it enters the lungs
general 2021-07-29 13:52:26 I said uranium, you moved it to other topics
general 2021-07-29 13:52:53 because I tried to answer your point?
general 2021-07-29 13:53:27 You went off-topic
general 2021-07-29 13:53:33 so I followed the conversation
general 2021-07-29 13:54:06 
general 2021-07-29 13:54:09 look
general 2021-07-29 13:54:17 Yes
general 2021-07-29 13:54:26 that is a relevant analogy of breathing in a hazardous material
general 2021-07-29 13:54:31 such as breathing in uranium dust
general 2021-07-29 13:54:34 analogies
general 2021-07-29 13:54:41 they are important for context and comparison
general 2021-07-29 13:54:48 Do you not understand basic conversation
general 2021-07-29 13:54:58 It's a comparison to get my point across
general 2021-07-29 13:55:17 Yes, and I am using asbestos as an analogy to get my point to be clearer
general 2021-07-29 13:55:23 Go google "analogies"
general 2021-07-29 13:55:41 You don't need to ask for it
general 2021-07-29 13:55:47 analogies are a basic part of conversations
general 2021-07-29 13:55:56 they are important when you are trying to convey a point
general 2021-07-29 13:56:11 I did not know that you got the point
general 2021-07-29 13:56:15 make it clear perhaps?
general 2021-07-29 13:56:36 You're at fault for not clarifying
general 2021-07-29 13:56:54 It is normal for me to not ask
general 2021-07-29 13:57:43 You're talking non-sense
general 2021-07-29 13:57:53 in the normal conversation nobody asks that
general 2021-07-29 13:58:01 only in presentations to large crowds
general 2021-07-29 13:58:40 How is it not a normal conversation
general 2021-07-29 13:58:51 <@!546223347025969164> Send me the source
general 2021-07-29 13:58:53 the link
general 2021-07-29 13:59:28 The source doesn't specifically say metal dust
general 2021-07-29 13:59:52 You can't check the sources you're reading?
general 2021-07-29 14:00:13 No, you didn't even skim through it
general 2021-07-29 14:00:22 You merely read one sentence and took it as fact
general 2021-07-29 14:00:47 Doesn't seem like you did
general 2021-07-29 14:00:54 You missed crucial information that was obvious
general 2021-07-29 14:02:27 And what does that have in relation with coughing?
general 2021-07-29 14:02:36 you're going off topic again
general 2021-07-29 14:03:04 The part you gave has no relation to the current topic
general 2021-07-29 14:03:12 What even is your point
general 2021-07-29 14:03:16 you're not even trying to make one
general 2021-07-29 14:03:34 My point is that breathing in uranium dust is lethal
general 2021-07-29 14:03:49 and?
general 2021-07-29 14:04:30 <@!335599526414909451> I think that we are having a civil debate and I think that the topic at hand isn't inappropiate
general 2021-07-29 14:05:23 coughing barely helps
general 2021-07-29 14:05:40 Yes but it barely helps
general 2021-07-29 14:06:00 metalworkerss who are often exposed to high amounts of airborne metal dust without protection often develop lung diseases
general 2021-07-29 14:06:16 even if they cough out, it will still build up
general 2021-07-29 14:06:31 "without protection"
general 2021-07-29 14:07:09 Most tank crews don't wear protective equipment inside tanks, so there is a high likelyhood of them breathing in the uranium dust
general 2021-07-29 14:07:15 You're going off topic again
general 2021-07-29 14:07:54 Yes, the world is based on chances, nothing is certain and nothing is impossible
general 2021-07-29 14:08:38 High likelihood is enough to be considered dangerous so that is why breathing in uranium dust from tank shells is lethal
general 2021-07-29 14:09:11 Even then, if you don't die instantly, the uranium dust sitting inside your lungs is likely to lead to cancer and lung diseases in the future
general 2021-07-29 14:09:28 Well, I think that it doesn't help enough, it may help but not enough to save you from death
general 2021-07-29 14:09:57 Yes, but if you breathe in uranium dust you die earlier
general 2021-07-29 14:10:16 surviving a sabot shot through your tank
general 2021-07-29 14:10:46 The whole penetrator is made out of depleted uranium, and there's even more if the armour is uranium
general 2021-07-29 14:11:27 There are cases in the Gulf War where people inspecting destroyed tanks got cancer from the dust floating around inside the crew compartment after  it was shot
general 2021-07-29 14:12:07 I didn't say the cancer was from the radiation nor standing near it will cause you to die.
Being shot by the uranium sabot is enough to put uranium dust in the air
general 2021-07-29 14:12:31 Plus uranium is a heavy metal, so its poisonous like lead
general 2021-07-29 14:13:18 Depleted uranium is merely a different isotope, it maintains it's chemical properties and poisonous characteristic
general 2021-07-29 14:13:46 Depleted uranium is a waste product, the government would pay someone to get rid of it, so why not just use it in shells?
general 2021-07-29 14:14:07 Yes but it's still lethal enough to kill you from the dust.
general 2021-07-29 14:14:19 Nobody puts pure uranium in their shells
general 2021-07-29 14:15:00 Yes, you implied that the government puts pure uranium into their shells
general 2021-07-29 14:15:21 Yes
general 2021-07-29 14:15:33 that is why nobody puts it into their sabot shells
general 2021-07-29 14:15:42 Ok then
general 2021-07-29 14:15:51 I suppose we are settled
general 2021-07-29 14:16:01 uranium dust from a penetrator is lethal
general 2021-07-29 14:16:13 as the conclusion.
general 2021-07-29 14:16:26 Wow, a civilised debate in PCC
general 2021-07-29 14:16:28 how??

general 2021-07-30 19:53:33 the whole thing?
general 2021-07-30 19:53:54 oligone is blind
general 2021-07-30 19:53:59 Yes
general 2021-07-30 19:54:31 If you'd like it like that then sure
general 2021-07-30 19:54:40 try methanol
general 2021-07-30 19:54:42 works great
general 2021-07-30 19:55:19 One piece of shrapnel hit the barrel and the tank died
general 2021-07-30 19:55:31 those tanks have no armour yes
general 2021-07-30 19:55:36 but that armour is to protect from shrapnel
general 2021-07-30 19:55:59 even then, it's a cannon calibre HE shell and not a 250 kg bomb
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 19:56:27 Cube
general 2021-07-30 19:56:39 It's a HE shell
general 2021-07-30 19:56:42 not a 250kg bomb
general 2021-07-30 19:56:52 the pressure wave isn't strong enough to kill
general 2021-07-30 19:57:07 The wave is too weak
general 2021-07-30 19:57:09 heeelllooo
general 2021-07-30 19:57:12 common sense
general 2021-07-30 19:57:23 search up the overpressure article on wikipedia <@456226577798135808>
general 2021-07-30 19:57:41 search up the overpressure article on wikipedia <@456226577798135808>
general 2021-07-30 19:57:44 WOW
general 2021-07-30 19:58:05 The pressure wave isn't enough
general 2021-07-30 19:58:24 armour implosion wouldn't happen because the shell landed infront of the tank
general 2021-07-30 19:58:26 Yeah sure
general 2021-07-30 19:58:47 try hiding behind a 20mm steel plate from a 5kg block of RDX
general 2021-07-30 19:58:51 it's survivable
general 2021-07-30 19:58:57 Yes
general 2021-07-30 19:59:05 but it's not strong enough to destroy the tank hull
general 2021-07-30 19:59:18 I did not say that explosives don't have it
general 2021-07-30 19:59:20 it exists
general 2021-07-30 19:59:33 Too far away to be lethal
general 2021-07-30 19:59:41 are you blabbering
general 2021-07-30 19:59:46 research lol
general 2021-07-30 19:59:58 come back with 9th grade physics knowledge
general 2021-07-30 20:00:50 Who said it was 250gr
general 2021-07-30 20:00:57 my point is that the game is dumb
general 2021-07-30 20:01:02 and the overpressure mechanic is dumb
general 2021-07-30 20:01:06 that shouldn't kill
general 2021-07-30 20:01:19 both irl and in war thunder
general 2021-07-30 20:01:26 but the recent updates messed it up lol
general 2021-07-30 20:01:30 so much for being realistic
general 2021-07-30 20:02:03 It's a 155mm shell
general 2021-07-30 20:02:09 and it exploded 10 metres away
general 2021-07-30 20:03:16 
general 2021-07-30 20:03:49 <@456226577798135808> following your logic 15 mg of explosives will kill you from 150 metres away
general 2021-07-30 20:04:10 so the whole map should've died from the pressure wave
general 2021-07-30 20:04:13 because you said so
general 2021-07-30 20:04:46 you implied it?
general 2021-07-30 20:04:50 are you trying to deny
general 2021-07-30 20:05:00 Where are your sources on that or are you just making things up
general 2021-07-30 20:05:11 lol says the one fabricating information
general 2021-07-30 20:05:28 oh no I can't back up my point
general 2021-07-30 20:05:40 better call em something bad
general 2021-07-30 20:05:45 uhh dictionary
general 2021-07-30 20:07:24 <@456226577798135808> yeah
general 2021-07-30 20:07:32 kk
general 2021-07-30 20:07:32 so you're switching the topic because you're losing
general 2021-07-30 20:07:33 also
general 2021-07-30 20:07:34 https://wiki.warthunder.com/NSJ_L/30_(155_mm)

general 2021-07-30 20:13:49 So you expect the pressure wave to magically curve like this?
general 2021-07-30 20:14:15 I'm just picking a fight because I'm bored and I hate him geniunely
general 2021-07-30 20:14:18 gaslighting
general 2021-07-30 20:14:38 no, oligone is a special case
general 2021-07-30 20:15:02 Then I am yet to see the worst
general 2021-07-30 20:15:54 Man
general 2021-07-30 20:16:06 I paid 50 dollars for this and I'm using it to doodle

general 2021-07-30 20:16:42 No
general 2021-07-30 20:17:10 Do it on CSP for the swag
general 2021-07-30 20:17:19 plus paint doesn't have layers
general 2021-07-30 20:17:59 <@!335599526414909451> Hey do you think I should make an Object 279

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:27:04 what did the message say
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:27:38 idk then
general 2021-09-04 11:51:51 lol
general 2021-09-04 11:51:51 just send 127.0.0.1
general 2021-09-18 17:47:28 is turn radius or turn rate more important in pvp
general 2021-09-18 17:47:32 🤔
general 2021-09-18 17:47:39 this game
general 2021-09-18 17:48:07 turn radius is the radius of the circle the plane makes when ur making a turn
general 2021-09-18 17:48:40 ok but which one wins you a pvp dogfight in plane crazy?
general 2021-09-18 17:50:17 no
general 2021-09-18 17:50:20 turn rate is how fast you turn
general 2021-09-18 17:50:29 turn radius is how much space u need to turn
general 2021-09-18 17:51:07 yes
general 2021-09-18 17:51:09 but like
general 2021-09-18 17:52:22 trying to build a plane that can achieve everything
general 2021-09-18 17:53:22 mouse aim, high manoeuvrability at low speed, can turn as fast as you can move your mouse, controllable at super speed
general 2021-09-18 17:54:02 ok
general 2021-09-18 17:54:04 different question
general 2021-09-18 17:54:13 would you rather slow down to turn slower but tighter or
general 2021-09-18 17:54:23 turn at high speed to turn faster but bigger radius
general 2021-09-18 17:54:30 ik it doesnt work like this irl but its plane crazy
general 2021-09-18 17:56:14 im making everything in the plane mouse aim
general 2021-09-18 17:56:20 including using thrusters to mouse aim
general 2021-09-18 17:56:30 main control surfaces will be mouse aim too
general 2021-09-18 17:57:55 kinda
general 2021-09-18 17:58:01 doing something slightly different
general 2021-09-18 17:58:14 im gonna put vtol steering on my plane to boost turn force
general 2021-09-18 18:06:04 https://gyazo.com/12f5aa9e67fcb7b84a42959da8dc6ae6
general 2021-09-18 18:08:18 i agree
general 2021-09-18 18:08:22 people here toxic
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:24:46 don't think there would be a point to masculinist
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:25:31 humanity is inherently a patriarchal species
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:25:43 cuz men are biologically stronger and more dominant
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:26:22 though
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:26:28 women do have more social rights than men
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 03:26:55 in most developed nations
general 2021-10-14 16:36:02 Have not heard on plane crazy for 2 months
