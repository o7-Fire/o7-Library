plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:24:00 ok but seriously
has anyone seen an Espada 128B anywhere?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:24:11 I need help finding one.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:24:26 it's a computer that kind of resembles a new Macintosh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:24:38 but the CD tray is under the monitor
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:25:48 I'm using one right now and I've never seen another one
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:11 I don't know.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:21 I don't see a manufacturer name on it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:28 or anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:31 no serial numbers
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:27:34 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:28:17 it has 128 bit components I wanna take out of it for a project
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:28:45 I mean, 128B
it's in the name.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:29:30 the entire left side
not the right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:30:06 magnets can seriously mess up computers though
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:30:12 I wouldn't mess around too much
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:30:56 *you think*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:31:23 also the Espada 128B is German?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:32:52 German, has Spanish name, only known model to exist as far as I know is in America.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:33:00 mr. worldwide over here
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:34:44 most places sell for ~90 each
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:34:50 so 180 should be good
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:36:31 ok so
the Espada 128B came from the factory with an OS called Copland
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 04:36:56 but Copland is an unused OS by apple?
