creations-chat 2021-04-22 05:58:07 The American ones have way better colors you could do thunderbird colorway camo Blackhawk color way etc
creations-chat 2021-04-22 06:00:09 <@456226577798135808> nothing wrong with it but the color way is just plain 2 colors there are so many other appealing colors for the f4 phantoms that have been used.
creations-chat 2021-04-22 06:02:24 You got the plain dark grey the green tan camo thunderbirds color way Blackhawk color way and those are just the ones I know of my head. If you look at the color way he chose since his is jap it actually irl has the layout of the plane on it so on the wing the color way shows the wings.   War thunder does a great way of showing it
creations-chat 2021-04-22 18:22:31 <@!687455017040347158> posts a low effort build and nothing happens lol
creations-chat 2021-04-22 18:30:47 top seems blocky mostly because of the color way  I would go for a lighter brown to kinda fade with the green

creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:56:49 <@!500136411610218496> Those are normaly a dark silver color unless its an oversized load then they are yellow and the sleeper cab looks good but I havent seen a sleepercab with a window and your aerodinamic thing on the top is that not extended or is that extended.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:58:51 I have started about 3 arguments in here and 1 in general ima kinda good at it. Most of the time its backing somebody up ðŸ™‚ Rickje even got annoyed with me yesterday because i didnt know how to turn auto save off  <@!354280132569071616> And that is how it starts
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:18:01 <@!333570869114830859> all ima say theres some room to improve it has exposed blocks and its fixable so maybe stop arguing and fix it ðŸ™‚ all better <@!333570869114830859> not gonna argue you got mad he called you build blocky then you got defensive
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:20:02 <@!577604979909459989> You sir have hit the bullzie or how ever that is spelled <@!333570869114830859> you are a little hot right now and your brain isnt working properly you got mad about him calling your build blocky period now stop pinging me because im done (not aruging) with you.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:23:54 I dont care about grammar english is the hardest language and people mess it up and if you wanna start being mean to him ima go to his side why not be adults stop aruging and build
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:27:36 <@!588596347272167456> I dont even understand commas use your brain to work around it esspecially since his first language isnt english
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:30:42 <@!588596347272167456> says the one trying to make fun of a guy for not knowing english. Im done discussing english with you because you will just  keep being a baby about it dont ping me because I wont respond
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:49:55 So I posted mr sr71 in creations but because of its wing design it wont fly. If I shrink it shouldnt that make it flyable?  Make it smaller.  Right now it is the entire plot in length lets say I make it half the plot long
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:52:11 the wing pannels are just pannels in the wing idk how to motor lock The rutters are motor powerd the up and down is control surfaces
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:56:25 <@456226577798135808>? <@!582834773773254656> Then have landing gears in em As the post says fully functional And the landing gear for a sr71 has 3 tires for the back landing gears all filled with nitrogen to survive the 217mph takeoff and the 170ish landing
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:58:30 Well it can if I helium it but atm with no helium it wont fly it floats more then flys
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:01:56 Im making a mini version rn <@!783822669182795806> no But in creation feedback yes
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:05:19 That isnt even close to repersenting a sr71 it looks like a sk60 cockpit with a stupid cardboard box as wings <@!642151786966286348>
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:07:20 <@!461639155911229440> Wings have a big landing gear in them <@456226577798135808> I dont build planes I build boats and the sr71 is my airplane build so idk how to do that  <@!461639155911229440> It has decently thick wings it has to big about a 1 foot wide landing gear from top to bottom
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:09:34 Thats a fake sr71 or photoshoped in. last time I checked private airplanes dont fly with a military  aircraft
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:11:50 <@!642151786966286348> <@!461639155911229440> look at a real sr71 in real life then start talking. My grandapa that guarded this aircraft knows it from wing tip to wing tip and gave me the heights of everything then I enlarged them to make it function.
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:17:39 <@456226577798135808> Diffrent sr71's
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:21:04 THERE IS A LANDING GEAR IN THE WINGS IT IS A BLOCK THICK AND THE PLANE NEEDS THE EXTRA SPACE UNLESS YOU WANNA SEE LANDING GEAR PARTS STICKING UP WHICH THEN YOU WOULD FREAK OUT ABOUT Maybe build one yourself that is fully functional then start talking because ik all of you havent built one
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:24:32 <@456226577798135808> Whats helping deffintion. Making fun of a build non stop you have been doing this for 5 minuets now just making fun of it. You could just say make the wings smaller and round  it not bullying it\
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:28:43 The landing is big because it has 3 tires on it so 3 blocks big
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:32:16 Build the front of the sr71 then I will listen
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:37:07 <@!399470016807960586> Ping me and post the build here when you are done with it
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:39:16 Show that it has landing gears <@!577655331229007872> Because its realistic
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:46:21 Is the 1 nose cone out of the 3 the sr71s can chose from
creations-chat 2021-04-24 00:59:31 <@!461639155911229440> thats a sr71a wrong type
creations-chat 2021-04-24 01:01:41 you yell at me for not knowing my sr71's then you make the wrong type of sr71 LOL <@!461639155911229440> you where bullying me saying I dont how to make a sr71 at all and your eyes cant ell a point nose from a spoon nose  <@456226577798135808> the nose is very good but its for the wrong aircraft
creations-chat 2021-04-24 01:03:42 <@456226577798135808> that has the sr71a on the top and bottom and the sr71 for the middle 2
creations-chat 2021-04-24 01:05:53 <@!399470016807960586> the sr71 lockheed is the middle aircraft with a spoon nose and the bottom one and top one is a sr71a lockheed blackbird. <@!582834773773254656> No im aruging with someone that is trying to school me by building the wrong aircraft type
creations-chat 2021-04-24 01:08:27 <@456226577798135808> Wrong version I need the other version
creations-chat 2021-04-24 01:10:29 the sr71 not the sr71a.  <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:43:47 <@!366574890943250432> my grandpa lost his hearing guarding that plane.What color are the after burners on the sr71
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:45:49 <@!366574890943250432> what is the hull made out of the metal type and what is inside the hull do not answer shaded what are the tires filled with what did they have to do before take off to save lives
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:48:47 Titanum hull is filled with fuel tanks tires are filled with nitrogen there are 2 seats in the plane the camra guy the pilot. The sr781 has 3 nose cones. They had to reduce the fuel on take off by 40 thousand pounds of fuel to save pilots lives. they lost 4 pilots to fuel issues and 6 to tires. You think I would know this  without my grandapa telling me <@!366574890943250432> There may be stolen valour out there but this one aint dont disrespect the american military period im done with you <@!642151786966286348> look at it even my grandpa know that <@!366574890943250432> you  could watch my  streams building it my grandpa said the engins are 2/3 of the plane told me where the landing gears go
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:51:24 Yea really. These guys bullyed my build for a straight hour yesterday then they still doing it today. But this time they are going after my grandpa that guarded the sr71
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:53:48 <@!642151786966286348> if you google what metal is the sr71 made out of this is what shows "The primary titanium alloy used in the SR-71 was thirteen percent vanadium, eleven percent chromium , and three percent aluminum. Both Chromium and Aluminium form thermally stable oxide layers on the outer skin of the metal. Which prevents oxygen from diffusing further into the metal and causing it to become more brittle."
creations-chat 2021-04-24 14:55:52 <@!366574890943250432> you bullied a build for an hour and you expect me not to get a little heated. Saying the same things over and over then saying my grandpa isnt military. That is about the most disrepsecful thing you could do. Now It ends here period  <@!495210490172014612> Yea ik but ima argue when someone calls people in the military fakes and starts dissing the military sorry but its ended now I wont be responding anymore to this guy
