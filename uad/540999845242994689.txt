plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:06:06 we have stereoscopic vision. Our brain takes the two images from our eyes and takes the placement, shadows, and difference in object placement between the two images to turn the 2d images our eyes give the brain into the 3d images we think we see. You can also do this with one eye but it is technically less advanced in making a 3d image even if it looks the same; your brain will use different things to look for in order to add depth compared to when you are using both your eyes.
