creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:01:36 The real damage appears when you use pairs

creations-chat 2020-09-16 04:20:13 I just said what I was thinking. I was thinking of rainbow six siege bandit because he is battery boi

creations-chat 2023-02-05 02:22:15 Mostly just size… it seems a bit unnatural, and I feel like there could be just slightly more detail with such size

creations-chat 2023-02-05 02:32:57 I know there is, it’s just when cleaning vehicles for so much, for me at least, makes vehicle scaling feel awkward
