general 2022-06-10 15:27:57 The terms here are more confusing than a dictionary

general 2022-06-10 15:29:25 It’s like learning a new word

general 2022-06-10 15:33:16 Please don’t
general 2022-06-10 15:33:31 Is this what it means to be in a RP game?
general 2022-06-10 15:33:58 Rip :((
general 2022-06-10 15:34:21 After seeing the amazing models here, all I can say as a dude who started out. I am infinitely worse
general 2022-06-10 15:35:51 My man crashed, INTO A HEDGE/BUSH
general 2022-06-10 15:36:36 Just use auto aim missiles
general 2022-06-10 15:36:42 W ha ?
general 2022-06-10 15:37:11 Just use the screwdriver thing on your bottom left of your screen
general 2022-06-10 15:37:19 And select ur missile
general 2022-06-10 15:37:31 Than uh go turn on whatever it says that turns on auto aim
general 2022-06-10 15:37:38 It auto aims to late
general 2022-06-10 15:39:48 Damn, will someone explain to me what’s a shredder?
general 2022-06-10 15:41:17 Explain how powerful is that thing?
general 2022-06-10 15:41:51 So it kills tank? How make anti tank missile ?
general 2022-06-10 15:42:02 Fuck what?
general 2022-06-10 15:42:23 Took me a good 5 seconds to figure out the emoji
general 2022-06-10 15:42:28 What?
general 2022-06-10 15:43:06 Oh I thought it was something else
general 2022-06-10 15:43:14 Explain
general 2022-06-10 15:44:20 Not yet
general 2022-06-10 15:44:39 Ferrari
general 2022-06-10 15:44:52 Yesnt
general 2022-06-10 15:45:30 The builds in plane crazy are incredible but. How do people even do it?
general 2022-06-10 15:45:41 The motors John, they scare me
general 2022-06-10 15:46:20 I don’t even know what that means
general 2022-06-10 15:46:51 Oh. Lemme guess technic pieces  with some good old build technics ?
general 2022-06-10 15:47:14 Alright I just figured it out
general 2022-06-10 15:47:21 They use motors to make better shapes
general 2022-06-10 15:47:44 Like how Lego uses some hinges and or technic pieces to make some very nice shapes
general 2022-06-10 15:48:29 Certain Technic pins allow them to add studs to the holes making them compatible with normal Lego plates and or bricks lol
general 2022-06-10 15:51:42 Damn bro they used some good technics on that build
general 2022-06-10 15:52:21 Good model but I hope it’s stable
general 2022-06-10 15:53:18 Wait a minute is everyone here familiar with history of military vehicles?
general 2022-06-10 15:55:42 Welp this is the part where I’ll probably start lurking here since I’m not fully familiar in military and or any civilian vehicles
general 2022-06-10 15:56:14 I don’t play war thunder
general 2022-06-10 15:56:29 I don’t play any realistic game tbh
general 2022-06-10 15:56:43 Explain how?
general 2022-06-10 15:57:23 I don’t even like cars lmao. I don’t even know the name of my family’s car
general 2022-06-10 15:57:58 Something tells me war thunder is like LoL
general 2022-06-10 15:58:06 If so I’m just gonna slowly back away
general 2022-06-10 15:58:40 Oh it’s a PC game
general 2022-06-10 15:58:59 Here’s the major problem. I don’t have a pc anymore
general 2022-06-10 15:59:15 32% of the time
general 2022-06-10 15:59:25 Wait it is?
general 2022-06-10 15:59:49 That’s literally my only platform left lmao
general 2022-06-10 15:59:58 I would use my PC if I could
general 2022-06-10 16:00:06 If I hadn’t broken the monitor out of rage
general 2022-06-10 16:00:44 Your pfp is familiar
general 2022-06-10 16:01:07 Kill that movie rn
general 2022-06-10 16:01:40 It’s basically a meme version of whatever George Washington said about Firearms
the-dump 2022-06-10 16:03:06 Isn’t that the same dozer that went on a spree of destruction on buildings and was sealed tight and it took hours to break the guy out before he killed himself before being caught?
general 2022-06-10 16:03:42 Show them the pain of bleach and ammonia mixed together
general 2022-06-10 16:04:29 You clearly haven’t made mustard gas before
general 2022-06-10 16:04:45 I have
general 2022-06-10 16:06:06 Is that a name of a human?
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:51:39 The controls scare me for some reason
general 2022-06-11 03:16:28 Dumb question but is the ERA possible in plane crazy?
general 2022-06-11 03:16:50 Partially possible or just no?
general 2022-06-11 03:16:56 Oh
general 2022-06-11 03:17:02 I’ll assume it blows up to much
general 2022-06-11 03:17:13 Honestly I just want the ERA for shredders lol
general 2022-06-11 03:17:24 And set them to impact
general 2022-06-11 03:18:01 Oh that explains why my ERA keeps blowing up my left engine
general 2022-06-11 03:18:05 It goes boom?
general 2022-06-11 03:18:24 Wait a minute
general 2022-06-11 03:18:38 But doesn’t the TNT have that option to set in on impact?
general 2022-06-11 03:19:14 My tank uses hover systems and sometimes skis ;-;
general 2022-06-11 03:23:12 I prefer the HUT
general 2022-06-11 03:29:23 Wait what? W h y?
general 2022-06-11 03:30:13 Weird
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:30:21 Do it
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:30:38 Oh I thought the giant ring was part of the ship lmfao
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:31:20 You could probably downsize it a little bit but maintain some of the details
contest-chat 2022-06-11 04:40:06 People would understand if you don’t considering the size of the ship and the stuff you gotta add to it
general 2022-06-11 04:41:02 Would a suspension engine perform well within a hover tank?
contest-chat 2022-06-11 05:04:46 Considering the fact that I just joined yesterday I’ll assume the server does care about the interior which probably means the models here are top notch and are probably created to be as realistic as possible since everyone here is pushing PC limits of how damn good can a model be before it’s considered to be from another game
help 2022-06-13 08:12:41 Can someone please tell me how does one make metal gear rex legs?
general 2022-06-13 08:13:17 Mech builders of plane crazy, how does one make metal gear rex legs?
