general 2022-06-06 06:42:36 I went to an air force exhibit in the Philippines
general 2022-06-06 06:42:45 And they have 13 outdated planes

general 2022-06-06 06:55:46 I have a question how do you guys have all the time in the world
general 2022-06-06 10:15:39 I spent so much time on making a big plane fly
general 2022-06-06 10:15:43 It all failed
general 2022-06-06 10:15:46 :(
general 2022-06-06 10:21:13 It doesn't need folds but its big
general 2022-06-06 10:21:51 The problem is i spent so much time trying to make it fly yet it doesn't
general 2022-06-06 10:22:14 R.i.p all that time ill never get back
general 2022-06-06 10:22:37 Yup
general 2022-06-06 10:23:10 Bruh what kind of idiot leaves for a thumbnail it doesn't effect the game at all

general 2022-06-06 12:16:32 Hey <@707777796843372554> do you have any tank building tips
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 12:29:42 I can use my sword to go up to speeds of 500
creations-chat 2022-06-07 04:14:42 Did i ask
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 04:16:03 I meant swing speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 04:16:35 And its fast enough to catch most pvp built vehicles
creations-chat 2022-06-07 04:21:26 Why are you replying* also i had to sleep and then carry some heavy shit for my mom
general 2022-06-07 07:52:44 I wonder if someone made a missile using a conveyor or hover engine
general 2022-06-07 07:52:59 That would be op if you know how to use it
general 2022-06-07 07:53:06 Shooting a missile at mach 1
general 2022-06-07 07:53:40 Most of the cars in the Philippines that are meant for transport have a bad quality
general 2022-06-07 07:53:44 Your not the only one
general 2022-06-07 07:54:04 I have yet to see a super car
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 07:54:53 
general 2022-06-07 07:55:22 You guys got any tank building tips
the-dump 2022-06-07 07:56:25 R.i.p
creations-chat 2022-06-07 08:02:32 What tank should i build
creations-chat 2022-06-07 10:49:25 Hippity hoppity your color code is now my property
creations-chat 2022-06-07 11:13:07 Yeah it aint gonna be moving smoothly
creations-chat 2022-06-07 12:50:40 I give you a plane that everyone will hate
the-dump 2022-06-08 08:46:35 Now that's just plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 08:47:06 I didn't make my carrier big enough
general 2022-06-08 08:47:49 I watched Davon's plane fall of my carrier twice
general 2022-06-08 09:00:32 But you could make it into anything
general 2022-06-08 09:00:43 You have a mine field you got a sherman for that
general 2022-06-08 09:00:51 Need a bigger gun you have a sherman for that
general 2022-06-08 09:01:03 Need to clear debris you have a sherman for that
general 2022-06-08 09:01:22 Need more armor you got a sherman for that
general 2022-06-08 09:01:35 Need a troop carrier you got a sherman for that
general 2022-06-08 09:02:29 Btw whats the state of GASF
general 2022-06-08 09:02:43 The last time i joined Gasf it was dead
general 2022-06-08 09:03:18 The concept of the T-34 was good but in battle it was insane and stupid
general 2022-06-08 09:03:33 You got so many of them coming at you crashing and ramming and exploding
general 2022-06-08 09:03:37 They get stuck everywhere
general 2022-06-08 09:04:05 Kv-1 wasn't a good tank either it had many technical problems
general 2022-06-08 09:04:25 The T-34 had a simplified production and was easy to make
general 2022-06-08 09:04:59 Always have been
general 2022-06-08 09:05:18 I know because the rest are stuck in anti tank ditches or blown to smithereens
general 2022-06-08 09:05:25 Or smelted
general 2022-06-08 09:05:50 There was
general 2022-06-08 09:06:01 A early soviet light tank
general 2022-06-08 09:06:29 Yup if you would through a rock at it it could explode
general 2022-06-08 09:06:45 Btw what happened to GASF
general 2022-06-08 09:06:51 Is it gone
general 2022-06-08 09:08:08 When i joined it this year it was dead no one was there and they removed GA
general 2022-06-08 09:08:17 R.i.p GA
general 2022-06-08 09:08:28 Why did they even remove GA
general 2022-06-08 09:08:43 Who destroyer
general 2022-06-08 09:09:01 Or the guy who once told me to fuck off when i accidentally friended him
general 2022-06-08 09:09:30 Something tells me if you did something long ago he wont forgive you long after
general 2022-06-08 09:10:35 So that's why he still hates me with all his might
general 2022-06-08 09:10:45 All i did was be underaged 2 years ago
general 2022-06-08 09:10:55 And he still hates me for it most likely
general 2022-06-08 09:11:51 I wonder what Destroyer is doing now and what everyone's opion was on him
general 2022-06-08 09:12:16 Its actually doing it right that's the proboem
the-dump 2022-06-08 09:34:46 
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:14:31 I made micro tank what is your opinion on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:14:36 Also this is the first actually good looking tanks i made
general 2022-06-08 12:15:14 I made a tank and it had way too much motor locking for me to handle
general 2022-06-08 12:15:28 But hey it worked
general 2022-06-08 12:15:31 It looks good
general 2022-06-08 12:15:37 But i cant use the turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:39:08 I dont see what makes it bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:39:23 What ever works
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:39:33 Also this is what it looks like on plot
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:39:37 
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:39:49 Yes because im not that good at making a tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:40:04 Im too lazy to add tracks
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:40:42 Bruh get yo stupid ass out of here no beginner can make a 2 story tall motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:40:54 And make it work
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:41:25 Not in my eyes the only reason you say that is because your better then most builders here
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:42:22 I made it myself when idk how to use motorlocks properly and im proud of it
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:42:34 But then again its your opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:42:36 So be it
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:42:59 I asked for your opinion that's your opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:43:37 I know its gonna do shit since its mostly pro people or people who expect epic builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:43:42 It would be underwhelming
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:44:36 Cope and seethe which i shall
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:49:37 Im gonna have the balls to post my build in creations
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:49:44 And watch it get 1000 dislikes
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:55:08 Btw does it count as a ro scale vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 12:55:17 And thx

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:05:49 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2022-06-08 13:06:56 You know if you think about it being motorlocked is a painful death
general 2022-06-08 13:07:04 Your being crushed by 1000 of blocks
general 2022-06-08 13:07:07 That's gotta hurt
general 2022-06-08 13:08:16 Btw
general 2022-06-08 13:08:27 Does anyone know what i should say for my shitpost
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:08:59 Btw your tank is what inspired mine
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:09:14 Not the best looking compared to everyone else there tanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:10:24 
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:10:35 You can see some similarities but nothing else
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:11:33 Also the image quality isn't the best so you cant see the driver port i motorlocked in
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:11:48 I tried putting a machine gun in the hull but nothing worked
help 2022-06-08 13:12:39 It cant since we have already explored all possible connections
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:12:57 But what do you think about my tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:13:13 This is how it looks like
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:13:45 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:13:54 Very interesting
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:14:01 And complicated
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:14:15 Btw why are there motors in the gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:15:04 The blocks in the gun that you can see
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:15:20 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:15:33 I actually planned to use sparkles
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:15:39 But decided not to
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:16:17 Your Abraham's looks very cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:18:25 Cool

creations-chat 2022-06-08 13:19:26 Let me add more salt to the wound
general 2022-06-08 13:19:43 I should have made my half red baron pink
general 2022-06-08 13:20:07 So it would be a real shitpost

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:47:01 Work in progress meme
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:55:15 I tried once but it requires a big build
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:55:19 Also i never finished it
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:55:32 Its part of the mantlet
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 13:56:28 Nice

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:02:17 Sounds fun and its a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:02:34 Trying to make a small tank and making it look good is a challenge
the-dump 2022-06-08 14:04:01 
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:04:48 Its good

the-dump 2022-06-08 14:07:19 I didn't steal your meme
the-dump 2022-06-08 14:07:35 It was never yours in the first place
the-dump 2022-06-08 14:07:43 I stole it from the dead ahead discord
creations-chat 2022-06-09 08:00:08 Not for me
general 2022-06-09 10:20:54 I cant make a good motor locked plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:21:06 I gave up
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:21:30 My micro tank had a drivers visor
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:22:05 But it was hard to see
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:22:30 I actually planned to make my body Poke out of the commanders hatch but scrapped it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:23:59 Can i see a person next to it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:25:30 My tank was planned to have moving turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:25:40 But just like half of the other features
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:25:58 It either was scrapped or failed to work
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:26:23 A swas
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:26:48 It is banned in discord but not in the game
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:26:59 I can very much see it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:27:27 YUSS
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:27:32 GOOD IDEA
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:27:52 Ima make a Roscale russian tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:28:12 Since now i know one thing doesn't matter if the turret turns except when you make a film
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:29:08 Also i love spinning at speeds of 300 in my ro scale tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:29:43 I cant tell what the idea is
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:02 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:22 Well you could try to make a gap between the turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:31 Or you could use pistons
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:37 Like what doctor said
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:47 So you can make it go up and change its position
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:30:57 Same here
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:31:19 Despite our difference in skill our tank have the same problems
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:33:04 I actually wanted to make a T-62A
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:33:06 Thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:33:53 Unless you put a small gap
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:34:11 Add a drivers port
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:35:46 Given your tanks size
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 10:35:47 You could use a glass block and half wedge down
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:36:20 Should i use this or make custom turret
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:38:40 The caspian sea monster i made a plane of that but its mot good
general 2022-06-09 11:55:26 That gun looks severely underpowered
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:56:26 Because why not
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:56:29 Its cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:56:38 And i watched a 20 minute video on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:56:43 Before i made it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:56:55 It was that interesting
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:09 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:11 Making it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:16 Invisible on radar
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:32 I didn't manage to make it properly hover on water
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:49 I recognized you from somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:57:56 And now i know where
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 11:58:07 Also Le round turret
general 2022-06-09 11:58:41 This little shit is stupid
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:23:06 Your eyes must be shit then
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:24:14 It does
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:24:42 Draw a line that traces the god dam thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:24:53 Also you seem to expect everyone to be as good as you
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:25:24 Exposed motors 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:26:34 It does
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:27:06 I suggest using a few wedges
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:27:34 The nose can stay
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:27:41 But the body needs a little work
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:28:40 Im not making a motor locked plane since i cant make a good looking plane while making it function
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:28:47 And also make it do dog fights
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:28:50 Too much work
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:29:32 Im talking about making t look good and fly properly
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:29:58 That's a pain in my ass
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:30:17 I made a great looking helicopter and it could not fly
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:30:41 What happens if the body stars shaking or your helicopter starts flinging
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:30:53 Tried it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:31:08 It says helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:31:22 Dude it says helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:32:16 Not only are my drawing skills shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:32:26 But my build skills are
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:32:36 And everyone has mastered both of them
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:32:51 Dude
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:33:21 I have no bobux so half of my shit wont work in my favor
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:33:49 This sounds like me make something blindly pray it works
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:34:14 Anti Grav is behind a pay wall
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:34:25 While there are private servers
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:34:41 But then i can only use it there and no one uses em
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:34:53 Do i look like i havent tried it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:35:17 I tried making a star wars ship but it became an orbital laser
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:35:48 On accident yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:36:01 
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:37:24 Its from star wars the old republic
general 2022-06-09 12:38:19 10/10 since its better then anything ive drawn
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:38:56 Im now adding an orbital death ray too my harrower
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:39:05 So it will be a orbital death ray
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:40:22 If the tnt is blown up then it will lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:40:30 But other then that it was shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:40:40 Which is why i gave up
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:41:15 You do know that isn't gonna stop that part from crashing into my wings and ruining it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:41:59 I KNOW
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:42:13 BECAUSE I GAVE UP
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:43:39 I have no idea how that works
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:44:03 Btw can you understand this
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:44:21 You understand the motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:44:38 Me got lazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:03 I used trails
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:12 And the motor locks connect
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:23 It creates this little shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:44 Since i had no idea what i was doing half way in
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:50 I had to many big ideas
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:45:58 And tried to shove it into one thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:46:27 Its ro scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:46:36 Since that's what everyone tells me
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:47:46 I was thinking of a funny meme on a guy who said this italian tank had a dual 800 m machine gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:48:13 I just got an idea
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:48:22 Shove a super long gun into my tiny ass tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:48:35 Its low budget
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:49:12 My bf-109 has that problem by alot
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:54:26 I did the funny
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:54:27 Also chocolate camo
creations-chat 2022-06-09 12:55:19 Chocolate camo tank with 800 m barrel
general 2022-06-09 12:56:16 I made a tank with 800 m gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 12:56:37 What do you guys think about my tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 13:11:43 I gave it a gun the size of one plot
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 13:11:49 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 13:16:33 IM MAKING MY GUN THE SIZE OF THREE PLOTS
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 13:16:50 4 at max
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 13:17:19 Someone should make a meme about Kylo ren saying more and my tanks gun getting bigger and bigger
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 15:52:35 Super long gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 15:53:05 Also here is art piece
general 2022-06-09 15:54:40 I made very long gun
general 2022-06-09 15:54:44 In plane crazy
general 2022-06-09 15:54:52 Its very long 4 plots
general 2022-06-09 15:55:09 Do they even have buts to begin with
general 2022-06-09 15:55:15 All they do is steal people skin
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 05:41:11 I broke the sound barrier by using art
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 05:41:43 Want me to go up to 40 k
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 05:41:56 Very well
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:44:34 Fun fact i once wanted to make my own shredder which was meant to be bigger and faster
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:44:39 With rotating cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:44:43 But decided not too
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:44:59 Because 1. It would hurt the game badly in pvp if it worked
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 07:45:03 2. Too lazy
the-dump 2022-06-10 07:45:41 
the-dump 2022-06-10 07:47:04 Shredders in a nutshell
general 2022-06-10 07:47:28 I tried to use my shredders to kill an omni shredder user who was ruining pvp
general 2022-06-10 07:47:34 But i got obliterated
events-chat 2022-06-10 07:48:45 Lllooonggg gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 02:29:38 My one way ticket to the sky box
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 02:29:53 Every silo is filled with hover engines <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
the-dump 2022-06-11 02:31:33 When you lose half of your budget for rockets
the-dump 2022-06-11 04:24:34 It was me speedrunning making a rocket with hover engines
general 2022-07-16 13:16:30 Does anyone have a nice golden color code
general 2022-07-17 13:04:06 I was in the middle of making a fucking tank until someguy came and crashed the server
general 2022-07-17 13:04:35 Because we want to
general 2022-07-17 13:04:39 Its our trend
general 2022-07-17 13:04:48 Drive your vehicles into lava for selfies
general 2022-07-17 13:04:55 Its number one trending
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:29:32 I made a box plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:29:54 The only thing besides my B-17 and Ekranoplan that's a big build and can fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:30:14 I didn't put much effort into it just based it off this thing
general 2022-07-18 07:30:35 I made a box plane
general 2022-07-18 07:30:56 Remastered? Or original
general 2022-07-18 07:31:07 Chad
general 2022-07-18 07:33:03 I remember watching the pals when i was new to roblox in 2017
general 2022-07-18 07:33:40 But among the pals i enjoyed watching denis
general 2022-07-18 07:33:52 Yup
general 2022-07-18 07:34:28 Remember when games were easy to make and fun not copy and paste like now
general 2022-07-18 07:34:38 While there alot of good games that aren't like thay
general 2022-07-18 07:34:43 Its pretty hard to find them
general 2022-07-18 07:34:53 Due to the bullshit that is the roblox algorithm
general 2022-07-18 07:35:05 But then again its kinda good
general 2022-07-18 07:35:22 Because it doesn't bump up the standard to be recognized
general 2022-07-18 07:35:42 Pet sim was kinda p2w ngl
general 2022-07-18 07:35:48 But its pretty minor
general 2022-07-18 07:35:53 Compared to pet sim x
general 2022-07-18 07:36:03 And pet sim was actually fun
general 2022-07-18 07:36:13 And not an absolute chore
general 2022-07-18 07:36:28 Does anyone even like playing pet sim X
general 2022-07-18 07:36:48 Yes i watched many videos on it sadly didn't manage to play that game
general 2022-07-18 07:37:11 Remember when roblox wasn't full of drama
general 2022-07-18 07:37:36 You guys know bee swarm simulator
general 2022-07-18 07:37:38 Right?
general 2022-07-18 07:37:43 F
general 2022-07-18 07:38:06 But it wasn't that big compared to now
general 2022-07-18 07:38:24 You guys know the matrix
general 2022-07-18 07:38:39 Dont worry Elon musk will fix it
general 2022-07-18 07:38:41 Somehow
general 2022-07-18 07:39:08 But he bought enough of it to pretty much control it
general 2022-07-18 07:39:20 Waffle galaxy
general 2022-07-18 07:39:30 Also jacksepticeye
general 2022-07-18 07:39:43 Do any of you know waffle galaxy
general 2022-07-18 07:40:03 I mean the people who are working on twitter
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:40:20 ?
general 2022-07-18 07:40:31 Yes
general 2022-07-18 07:40:48 Except you actually get paid
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:40:58 What
general 2022-07-18 07:41:33 We're here to ask you about your cars extended warranty
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:41:43 Naw what?
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:43:21 They did this man dirty they removed the upvote button
help 2022-07-18 07:44:31 I think my gun barrel is too long
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:44:38 Show it
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 07:44:54 I made box plane
general 2022-07-18 07:45:23 F
general 2022-07-18 07:45:45 Your engine didn't motorlock inside
general 2022-07-18 07:45:58 Nevermind
general 2022-07-18 07:46:05 That was intentional
general 2022-07-18 07:46:21 I can see what you mean by too narrow
general 2022-07-18 07:46:36 Expand it by 4
general 2022-07-18 07:46:39 Blocks
general 2022-07-18 07:46:51 But make sure its centered
general 2022-07-18 07:46:59 Because then you got alot of problems
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:48:54 You do realize there people who actually like that and want to upvote that while you may downvote it because its worse then yours people like me would upvote it since its better then what we made (just ping me in general and talk)
general 2022-07-18 07:49:46 Waiting for some guy to finish his sentence due to 1 minute cooldown
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:51:55 Correction 11 (Just ping me and talk in general the chat cooldown is painfully long)
general 2022-07-18 07:52:09 Info wars?
general 2022-07-18 07:53:24 13
general 2022-07-18 07:53:47 Also your an expert designer and im an average motor lock user
general 2022-07-18 07:53:55 There's a clear difference in our skill
general 2022-07-18 07:54:13 That looks like the cat i let sleep on my lap once
general 2022-07-18 07:54:30 Bruh
general 2022-07-18 07:54:36 That's some bullshit
general 2022-07-18 07:54:55 If you can get expert designer via using a low effort box
general 2022-07-18 07:55:03 Then why have it in the first place
general 2022-07-18 07:55:14 Ive been lied to
general 2022-07-18 07:55:45 I have been told by plane crazy youtubers that expert shows your good at building in the game
general 2022-07-18 07:56:24 Apperantly the mods decided to give you a bunch of experts for dah funny
general 2022-07-18 07:57:10 I have a box plane does that count
general 2022-07-18 07:58:03 If i got expert design i would feel like i got it underdesreved
general 2022-07-18 07:58:12 Cause my building skills are from 2019 ish
general 2022-07-18 07:58:28 So there pretty much outdated
general 2022-07-18 07:58:37 I am
general 2022-07-18 07:58:42 Im trying to make a tank
general 2022-07-18 07:59:02 Also for whatever reason i decided to give a tank a 4 plot long gun
general 2022-07-18 07:59:33 This is the internet you can fake your height
general 2022-07-18 07:59:38 Why should we believe you
general 2022-07-18 08:00:44 Im working my way up to 6 foot
general 2022-07-18 08:01:03 Does height increase pp size
general 2022-07-18 08:01:28 My body is shaped like armins collosal titan
general 2022-07-18 08:01:33 My arms are fucking skinny
general 2022-07-18 08:01:40 And my legs are thick
general 2022-07-18 08:01:56 But not that thick
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:02:32 Ive grown from being a piece of shit who didn't understand age requirement
general 2022-07-18 08:02:53 I never skip leg day i guess
general 2022-07-18 08:03:20 I walk alot
general 2022-07-18 08:06:36 I wonder what Gasf thinks of me
general 2022-07-18 08:06:44 Since i used to be a piece of shit
general 2022-07-18 08:08:09 Remember what?

general 2022-07-18 08:19:11 <:duck1:652569234593021952>
general 2022-07-18 08:20:11 Did you seriously ping the man himself
general 2022-07-18 08:20:16 Just because of that
general 2022-07-18 08:20:32 Probably hates me
general 2022-07-18 08:20:45 Said fuck you after realizing i existed
general 2022-07-18 08:20:53 Again
general 2022-07-18 08:21:27 Oh just the obnoxious 11 year old who had bad builds that also started a fus
general 2022-07-18 08:21:38 Because I didn't realize you had to be 13 to use discord
general 2022-07-18 08:22:00 Im 13
general 2022-07-18 08:22:24 A plane who's having a seizure
general 2022-07-18 08:22:37 No one reads the terms of service anymore

general 2022-07-18 08:24:10 Also i think when you pinged destroyer he took one look at the screen and went adios <@287779983445721088>
general 2022-07-18 08:24:56 True because he could have also started either one asking questions or two start arguing with me
general 2022-07-18 08:25:13 Build land
general 2022-07-18 08:25:32 Ima dm you my history with Gasf
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:27:31 So your saying people should upvote a carrot instead of that
general 2022-07-18 08:28:42 Xm hull
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 08:29:58 
general 2022-07-18 09:12:53 Some guy said im whinning about a plane not having an upvote button
general 2022-07-18 09:13:01 Im just pointing it out
general 2022-07-18 09:14:04 Weakest air enjoyer seriously waiting out his cooldown just to chat lol
general 2022-07-18 09:14:16 It looks like hes taking things very seriously
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:15:41 Wanna know why im pointing out the fact this post got no upvote because i had a very shitty build and it had the upvote button and people actually upvoted it
general 2022-07-18 09:16:35 I just managed to shatter an argument by telling them about a very shitty build i made that got upvotes
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:18:27 Here is the picture that shatters most arguments about A-20 poohog(also for fuck sake just talk in general about this)
general 2022-07-18 09:19:48 Not really all
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:20:34 Just talk in general im watching you guys waste hours for s cooldown to go down
general 2022-07-18 09:21:54 27
general 2022-07-18 09:22:23 About 100
general 2022-07-18 09:22:34 The point pretty much was that people will upvote it
general 2022-07-18 09:22:36 If it had that
general 2022-07-18 09:23:30 To be expected for my tank if it had better camo probably would have improved
general 2022-07-18 09:23:48 Probably 30-40
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 09:24:19 Im doing that because i think its funny
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 09:24:57 Ever heard of puberty
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 09:25:26 Ok so
general 2022-07-18 09:25:49 Yes because i put it in the creation chat
