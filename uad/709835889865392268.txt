plane-crazy 2021-05-31 18:33:42 I have built the F-106, a pretty crappy rendition of the F-106
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 18:34:06 But cut me some slack since it was my first build and I was a noob
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 18:34:49 But anyways It did have a lot of advanced features, It may have not had the maneuverability but it had speed and a lot of fire power
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 18:35:10 plus, it served as a test bed for guided missle testing
