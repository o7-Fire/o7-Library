general 2022-08-19 00:31:10 lol
general 2022-08-19 00:31:49 i knew someone who did that and i loaded in the same build and they said i copied them by using a hack
general 2022-08-19 00:33:08 my brother wanted a sand box in the house once
general 2022-08-19 00:33:30 i said fine only if you clean the mess but my mom said no because it was such a bad idea
general 2022-08-19 00:33:47 dont we all
general 2022-08-19 00:34:47 most annoying thing: someone joins your server and black lists you for no reason
general 2022-08-19 00:35:22 they said they dont want to be bothered
general 2022-08-19 00:35:27 i respect that though
general 2022-08-19 00:35:50 its annoying if you are in a build and your spring for your motorlick is near their plot
general 2022-08-19 00:35:57 motorlock*
general 2022-08-19 00:36:01 yes
general 2022-08-19 00:36:17 yeah its a weird glitch

general 2022-08-19 01:56:40 i made the inner casing of my new jet and the engines are a bit long so i think i can use that as an advantage

bug-reports 2023-03-05 16:41:24 They only do that if the build is way too heavy for me I just add more wheels for a larger surface area and it has less weight on one motor
bug-reports 2023-03-05 18:00:13 Ah
the-dump 2023-03-05 20:46:51 Looks like an a-4E or some jet like that
