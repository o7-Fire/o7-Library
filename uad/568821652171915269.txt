creations-chat 2020-07-12 09:19:04 Thanks  I really appreciate it. 🙂
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:22:43 > they need to ban shredder bugs or smthn
Poser#5886
I can't agree more.
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:23:39 But the only solution is to this is remove cutter blocks.
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:24:58 And I'm not sure, if I should be happy that more and more people are starting to realize it...
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:25:32 because I can confirm that each day, there are more and more shredder bug users out there.
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:28:38 And I'm afraid, that **IF** nothing is gonna be done, we will come to an era, where there will be PVP servers with atleast 5 people using shredder bugs OR even entire servers filled with these people...
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:33:38 > Whats so cool bout them
Kendicus#6381
The "cool" thing about them is that they are
***1) EASY TO CREATE
2) THEY ARE EASY TO USE
3) THEY ARE HARD TO DESTROY***
creations-chat 2020-07-17 06:13:23 Ok could somebody explain the thinking process here?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 06:13:31 
creations-chat 2020-07-17 06:14:18 Either I have very bad taste in creations OR there is something else to these creations...

creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:41:28 ~~nevermind I used quote to figure it out.~~
creations-chat 2020-07-25 08:41:58 :D
help 2020-07-27 06:20:41 There are no rules in the terms of shredder bugs.
help 2020-07-27 06:21:01 They are the perfect weapons.
help 2020-07-27 06:21:15 Nothing can stop them,
help 2020-07-27 06:22:07 unless you go to their low levels and ***"fight fire with fire"***.
help 2020-07-27 06:22:40 No
help 2020-07-27 06:23:15 There are no rules against that and **never will**...
help 2020-07-27 06:23:30 deal with it.
help 2020-07-27 06:23:58 That's, what makes it so fun.
help 2020-07-27 06:24:34 You try to build something but then something screws up, so you gotta find a solution.
help 2020-07-27 06:25:16 > like i said, its no skill and no practice. Its basicly a ok to use exploit in a nutshell
Sir.Vapenation#1304
Stop reading my mind.
help 2020-07-27 06:28:20 > besides "fight fire with fire"
Sir.Vapenation#1304
From what I saw, actually fighting fire with fire is not effective if you want to destory them then because It's like Thanos vs Thanos.
help 2020-07-27 06:29:58 Most of your fights will end up in  draw,
help 2020-07-27 06:30:10 until one Side gains the upper hand.
help 2020-07-27 06:30:33 And when that happens,
help 2020-07-27 06:31:06 they will spawn camp the other side, alot.

I don't care, from where are you.
We now need to put aside our differences for this historic momment. Does not matter if you are pro or noob at building, does not matter if you are in regular servers or PVP, what matters is that times like these aren't happening every day so MAKE IT COUNT!

creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:27:03 I swear shredder bugs are like a virus.
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:28:58 They spread very quickly,( there was a shredder guy in server  dominating everyone and guy next to me, out of desperation started copying his shredder bug),
creations-chat 2020-08-14 06:29:57 and the more of them is in the world (Yesterday I saw server with 3 shredder bugs), the worse it is to live in that world.

the-dump 2020-12-30 14:43:01 I´m being bombarded with this ad for the past week or so.
the-dump 2020-12-30 14:43:54 Those toomics.uk had to pay youtube alot of money cause even when youtube allowed me to put like / dislike on it it still keeps playing and I don´t understand why because, I don´t watch anime of any kind.
the-dump 2020-12-30 14:46:05 oh lol I just noticed
the-dump 2020-12-30 14:46:45 Anyway the moral of this story is that youtube ads were mistake and adblock is the solution.

help 2021-07-27 13:48:27 So there is a issue with my motor-locking and it appears that no matter what block I place, as long as the block can be wielded together with other blocks, it gets wielded to some sort of phantom block, a block that isn´t there but the game thinks it´s there so it wields literally everything to it. I don´t know what is causing it since when I remove the cylinder the motor-locking works fine, not to talk about the fact that there is nothing above the cylinder (as I proved that early in video that by putting and then deleting block) yet it still gets wielded to something above it.
help 2021-07-27 13:51:04 Ok amma try to delete them, and move them somewhere else
help 2021-07-27 13:58:30 Thank you for the quick answer but even when I deleted every block that could have been potentially wielding with the motor lock, it still gets stucked mid air unless I remove the cylinder
help 2021-07-27 13:58:35 
help 2021-07-27 14:27:05 yes multiple times
help 2021-07-27 14:27:33 But cool news are that I fixed it, by ticking the physics option in anchor block as true.
help 2021-07-27 14:28:09 For some reason having physics off on anchor block AND putting tnt on your motor locking causes the motor to get stuck in air.
help 2021-09-04 15:21:01 Hello so I have a question: So I have a submarine made of 6.2 K blocks and I need to know if I should put in it  super rocket engine or water propeller 5x5 for propulsion?
