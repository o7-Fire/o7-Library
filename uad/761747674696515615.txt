general 2021-01-17 05:23:32 of the sphere thingy
general 2021-01-17 05:26:29 its rlly fast
general 2021-01-17 05:26:37 like almost teleport speed

general 2021-01-17 05:28:34 
general 2021-01-17 05:28:58 and sometimes the middle sphere detaches but can still move around
general 2021-01-17 05:30:11 also i managed to one shot it with my cutter bug
general 2021-01-17 05:30:16 but it took a while to actually hit him
general 2021-01-17 05:31:38 he was using a cutter bug too tho

plane-crazy 2021-01-17 17:24:17 but its a cutter bug
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 17:24:28 and sometimes the middle sphere detaches
