The Tale of maybe_asian (531690553285410833)
general 2021-08-20 02:32:22 Add a laser
general 2021-08-20 02:33:05 Honestly I think rickje should add a laser
general 2021-08-20 02:33:53 Holy jesus
general 2021-08-20 02:34:21 Maybe the infinite map will be like Minecraft bedrocks infinite map
general 2021-08-20 02:36:07 I'm concerned that pc2 won't have the player base that pc1 had
general 2021-08-20 02:36:37 Idk some sequel games just are more dead than the original game
general 2021-08-20 02:40:43 I feel like someone's gonna abuse that in pvp
general 2021-08-20 02:41:09 Well atleast I have more target practice
general 2021-08-20 02:41:59 A
general 2021-08-20 02:42:12 k
general 2021-08-20 02:42:27 EXIA
general 2021-08-20 02:42:51 HOLY sShIT fucking GUNDAM EXIA
general 2021-08-20 02:43:52 PC is better in terms of block count and physics while babft is better in build aesthetics
general 2021-08-20 02:44:33 I honestly prefer PC because I don't have the money to buy angle tools and literal blocks which can only be unlocked from loot crates
general 2021-08-20 02:45:15 And if it had a plane physics engine and a big open world map
general 2021-08-20 02:47:03 yer not my dad
general 2021-08-20 02:47:31 Fuck
general 2021-08-20 02:48:06 (family killed)
general 2021-08-20 02:48:40 (26 dead)
general 2021-08-20 02:49:20 (police invasion)
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:25:05 Cutters should only be used for detail and nothing else
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:25:26 Tutorial planes are fine
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:25:35 I don't get why people hate on them
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:26:43 Yeah but why do people have to hate on them tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:27:44 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:28:14 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:29:42 This game is about doing your own thing after all, it's not like building tuts is not allowed in the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:31:25 That had a different meaning to it
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:31:43 I put myself in bad situations all of the time
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:31:46 This isn't new
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:32:55 Moral of story: if they aren't bothering you, don't bother them
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:33:10 I hate a autocorrect
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:33:30 It capitalizes stuff and I hate it
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:33:47 It makes me sound serious and I don't like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:34:35 Plane crazy needs handheld guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:34:41 And melee weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:35:08 I want to shoot a tank with a 9mm
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:35:35 Happened several times
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:36:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:38:11 When I think of handheld weapons in plane crazy I think of prison life guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:38:30 llo
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:39:11 Well the Dev became a deadbeat and now hackers are in every server
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:39:35 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:39:59 Atleast bombers have effort put into them
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:40:05 Say that
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:40:48 Dm me build pic
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:40:56 Or send it here
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:41:16 Once I tried putting bombs on my fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:43:31 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:44:04 k
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:44:46 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:47:22 When you think 450 sps is fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:53:55 nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:31 Watching them try to justify using a shredder is funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:58 Also hunting the shredder down is funnier
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:55:36 Better not cut yourself in that edge
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:55:54 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:57:20 **Let me introduce you to my friend, the conveyor drive**
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:57:48 Tune it
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:58:02 Set the speed to 18 for stability
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:59:08 Why do people make shredders, they're weak, slow and easy to shoot down
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:59:49 That's unless you have a pvp tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:00:08 Oh wait NVM they can blacklist kill
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:00:41 In that case just use a pvp jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:01:07 seizure simulator 2021
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:02:13 I didn't mention tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:02:26 Also I stand by that until someone uses a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:02:41 Or any indecent build
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:03:19 yeah I did, also why are you picking me about this, that was 30 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:04:14 I guess I did contradict myself
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:04:43 Shoulda specified that I'm fine with tutorial builds, but I'm not fine with people actively trying to ruin someone else's day
general 2021-08-20 23:12:16 looks fart
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:38:29 The F/A - XX is just a pancake with wings and a jet engine strapped on it change my mind
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:39:56 That's my main concern, along with glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:40:22 All I want to do is pull 50gs and break the sound barrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:40:59 I swear if they patch it I will scream
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:41:52 They haven't yet so no
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:43:46 :}
general 2021-08-20 23:45:46 Haha imagine french
general 2021-08-20 23:46:12 Also I thought french was optional in canada
general 2021-08-20 23:46:28 **sus**
general 2021-08-20 23:46:59 Maybe it's because I chose the Chinese program and not some french program
general 2021-08-20 23:47:14 choose your next words carefully
general 2021-08-20 23:47:28 For it may be your last
general 2021-08-20 23:48:21 Then how are you not canadian
general 2021-08-20 23:49:03 I think I said something racist so I will now apologize before I get whipped
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:49:45 That thing is going to get shot down the second it enters pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:52:05 You should disguise it as a cargo ship and hide the missiles and guns in crates
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:54:13 say your a friendly ship in pvp and start picking off tanks one by one with ur missiles while ur at water
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:58:17 Good question
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:59:34 Huh

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:47:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:47:54 would be cool if plane crazy added radar crosssections
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:48:02 As also how detectable your plane is
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:48:40 Like say one missile gives away your position if there’s not blocks around it
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:49:19 And radar units can’t have blocks around them
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:49:23 Or they’ll not work
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:50:26 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:50:40 anyways it would be pretty cool to have that stuff
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 00:51:08 Shoot

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 00:35:25 Harrier
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 00:35:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 00:44:20 jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 00:44:24 The one that can vtol
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 00:44:38 k
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:48:01 That would get a bunch of new players banned
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:48:30 As much as I hate shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:48:41 I don't think they should be a bannable offence
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:49:40 a mach 1+ PvP jet can easily overpower a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:50:41 Scattercannons are more effective
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:50:57 Tnt ball cannons
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:51:09 The kind that fires like a shotgun
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:51:19 There's a YouTuber that's done it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:51:39 Look up namnam ch PvP montage
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:52:00 In the montage you'll find jets with those cannosn
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:00:11 You monster
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:00:25 Well I guess it's time to make depth charges
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:00:55 Motorlocked bombs with ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:01:21 I am a genius
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:02:29 That is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:03:06 Every building game has to have one player that abuses the physics engine to make a brokenly overpowered build
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:05:16 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 23:05:57 I really want to make a tnt shotgun and mount it on a plane

creations-chat 2021-11-29 19:54:22 serious shit is happening here
general 2021-11-29 19:54:49 some serious shit is happening in creations feedback
general 2021-11-29 19:57:12 how did you get a creations blacklist
general 2021-11-29 19:58:26 so ag-yt has a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:03:41 how do I explain to someone that tnt armor is useless on pvp jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:22 wha
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:26 bot is broken
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:04:38 you could literally aim for the wings instead
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:16 takes up space and looks ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:36 if you wanted it to not look ugly you would have to put more motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:42 which puts more weight on the jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:05:49 which makes it slower or less agile
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:06:24 just dont get hit
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:06:59 the only use for tnt on jets is unguided missiles or cluster munition bombs
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:30 one slap at the fuselage with a missile my jet just disintegrates mid air
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:07:55 like if you aim at the arch of my mig 29 it just disassembles mid air
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:13:26 anyways that jet you were gonna show me?
creations-chat 2021-11-29 20:13:39 friend is my zay

plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:14:28 very scuffed though I have to say
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:14:57 I mean atleast it has motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 20:37:13 just saying atleast it has it
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:38:37 who copy what
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:38:55 theyre really rare
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:05 your chances of encountering them are low
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:20 anyways what is the situation here
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:40:29 get used to it
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:40:55 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:44:57 gonna give up 5 minutes copying the locked controls on the plethora of motors
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:45:51 make a good looking build but with the most confusing controls
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:46:49 make the build look like a functional build
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:46:53 when in reality its not
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:46:56 just an empty shell
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:48:13 scatter the blocks all across the build so he has to find all of the anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:47:27 is that actually real
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:48:02 undersea life!!!111!!!
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 23:17:39 adding more control panels or using propellers

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 19:35:29 Anyways I prefer keyboard
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 21:05:31 what happens when you mix cam locking with glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:44:02 Maybe they’re not an unde
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:44:26 Just a really stupid 13 yr old
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:45:55 in that case he’s an unde
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:46:28 Literally no one uses drone swarms unless they’re an unde or a troller
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:48:58 they think they have the best build in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:49:06 And think people are scared of them
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:50:31 A single well aimed cluster bomb can put them mostly out of commission
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:51:15 sometimes I wonder if shredder users have a god complex
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:54:29 Just use a jet or a tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:55:03 Literally just build a tank, most efficient way of killing a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:57:05 I remember a time when there were 5 people using the madvulpen a-10 in a pvp server I was in
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:57:12 Best target practice ever
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 00:59:28 was so easy to rip their wings off
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:07:13 The amount of lag that might cause though
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:08:25 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:08:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:08:55 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:09:20 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:09:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 01:10:21 no

plane-crazy 2022-01-01 21:56:31 Put drag to 0
plane-crazy 2022-01-01 21:56:45 best way to bring out the performance in hover engines

plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:48:12 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:48:26 I eat spaghetti with chopsticks 😳
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:49:38 I sold both my kidneys to escape my work camp
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:50:03 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:50:11 what else do you have to say
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 07:50:34 no

plane-crazy 2022-01-10 18:20:26 wha
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 06:14:19 a
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:34:43 <@!481195267027238913> hey bro why are you saying motorlock is a sign of low skill when you use it yourself
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:36:16 Also don’t try to lie your way out of this I know what you said in that server
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:38:03 it isn’t
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:38:24 There’s only so much you can do without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:38:57 So motorlock is not a sign of low skill
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:39:19 I’m not talking about mechs
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:39:28 I’m talking about motor locking in general
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:39:41 try comparing them to ones with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:40:04 sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:40:35 very nice
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:40:44 Though I don’t see how you can motorlock that kind of stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:41:00 anyways
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:41:14 Point is that you shouldn’t give advice that applies to yourself too
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 00:41:27 <@!481195267027238913> *cough cough*
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 02:34:55 yeah but sometimes that kind of stuff is required
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 02:36:18 Plus having lots of motorlock allows you to modify your build more easily
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:38:35 Used to
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:13:49 Carchase moment
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:40:02 Imagine
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 18:07:23 but why do you wanna copis
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 18:07:44 copis cring
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 18:07:54 ah yes

plane-crazy 2022-01-18 18:07:58 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 17:49:22 glad I wasn't in that server
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 17:49:26 those all look like actual pvp tanks
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 06:59:52 Challenge for you guys here: get a plane up to Mach 1 with only propellers
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 05:44:37 a
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 18:45:54 cant wait for that client sided glitch to stop
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 19:39:25 such pro plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 19:39:30 so pro that it isn't
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 19:39:58 it was so pro that it became downright garbage
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 00:59:26 Hey bro we have life’s unlike you
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:00:13 for instance I barely spend 30 mins on plane crazy because I actually have other shit to do
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:00:58 building a motor locked jet barely takes me 30 mins <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:01:16 not anymore
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:01:59 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:02:46 this guy has been going all out on us while I’m here on a couch laughing
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:03:32 something for sure
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:03:42 Wait what lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:04:15 yup
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:05:09 do you even use block 1x4’s
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:05:25 Then why tf is it 790 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:05:52 At most that has to be 400 blocks max
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:06:50 That is an incredibly inefficient build
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:07:20 bro pvp builds aren’t supposed to have that much of a block count
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:07:32 400 blocks max
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:07:57 just fly better <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:08:26 I value being too fast to be hit
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:08:36 rather than take all of the bullets like a flying tank
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:09:21 nimble and fast jets are the meta
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:09:27 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:09:33 Belkan witchcraft
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:10:02 what happened to that 10build guy

plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:10:30 ran probs lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:11:20 saw that thing in pvp a couple of times
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:11:26 how tf does it vtol
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:11:47 and how does it have **thrust vectoring**

plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:12:46 oh shit he changed his name

plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:15:52 it’s kinda like a trial
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:16:22 A test to see if you are a crybaby that can’t handle criticism
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:18:06 Precisely

plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:48:37 utensil shredder
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:48:56 That wouldn’t be very practical
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:49:07 Shredtards mainly slam into the enemy
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:49:20 By putting bombs on it it would be a huge risk
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:56:12 In my opinion anti ground weaponry is best suited to planes
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:56:54 which is why we use cluster munitions
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:57:16 how the hell do you go underground
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:57:32 Oh just use guns for that
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:58:30 yeah no you could fly under the map with a plane that had a turret or use another underground vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 05:59:36 hey if ur using that cancer stuff it’s an excuse for me to use other cancer stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 06:00:02 yes

plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:05:30 are you trying to make it a pvp minibuild or a showplane
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:06:17 that is severely overlocked
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:06:29 for builds of that scale just use camera locking
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:06:49 angle locking is a little bit outdated
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:07:49 ima just dm you a cam locking guide
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:08:40 yeah ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:10:44 why do you have to angle lock your wing twice
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:13:35 wait to clarify, you have your ctrl surfaces and your actual wing 2 different parts?
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 22:14:06 -servers

general 2022-02-22 19:50:54 are these roblox mods actually braindead
general 2022-02-22 19:51:31 seriously roblox needs to fix moderation
general 2022-02-22 19:52:45 roblox really thought it was a good idea when they decided to use a robot to do this shit
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:38:47 noice f15
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:39:10 why is there turrets on that mig

plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:47:03 make it turn unshit
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:47:21 maybe the reason your mig has garbage turning is because it has small elevators
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:47:57 ah I see
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:08:24 canarded a-10 with angled vertical stabilizers

plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:10:25 yeah but the entire targetting hud is at the bottom corner
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:11:13 using an hud isnt really practical in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:11:55 im speaking from pvp experience when I say if ur in a high speed dogfight and ur using an hud
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 18:12:00 you're practically screwed

bug-reports 2022-03-08 05:39:21 camera settings keep resetting
bug-reports 2022-03-08 05:39:53 I swear to god I will scream
bug-reports 2022-03-08 16:53:40 like everytime I load in the build after saving its camera settings it literally has its keybind turned back to 1
bug-reports 2022-03-08 19:53:14 I saved it
bug-reports 2022-03-08 19:53:25 just when I loaded back the camera keybinds just suddenly reset
bug-reports 2022-03-14 23:05:44 We’ve been waiting for pc 2 for a while now
bug-reports 2022-03-28 22:31:42 roblox constantly crashes when I join plane crazy pvp
bug-reports 2022-03-29 01:28:11 no my computer could handle pvp mode pretty well before
bug-reports 2022-03-29 01:28:22 But now it just crashes whenever I go to pvp
bug-reports 2022-03-29 17:48:48 its not an fps/performance issue it literally crashes
bug-reports 2022-03-29 17:49:09 literally on non pvp it runs without crashing
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:07:31 only mobile shows it for easy interface
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:08:38 done that
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:08:50 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:08:58 I played on mobile with one of my trapdoor builds
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:09:28 it was a large green blob
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 20:10:02 that would be nice
bug-reports 2022-03-29 21:52:26 The app itself encountered the issue, my client was running 60 fps before
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 20:43:50 what happened to the april fools update
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:37:38 math moment
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:37:56 so subsonic is 975 sps?
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:38:09 nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:38:16 What about supersonic
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:38:58 thank you for the math
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:39:20 Indeed
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:39:31 math dealer
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:39:38 math dealership
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:43:41 I’m pretty sure it’s infinite
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:44:00 but at a certain height your character will glitch out really bad
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:48:50 1225 x 5 = 6125 sps?
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:49:10 mental math moment
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:49:43 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:51:26 6125 x 3 + 2445 = 18375 + 2445 = 20810 sps wtf
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:52:05 6125 if I’m correct
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:52:21 I used your calculations as a basis
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 08:53:45 how tf do you do that
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 08:06:57 Is your jet shaking too much
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 08:11:54 can you dm me a pic of ur jet in build mode
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:44:34 tunnel run moment
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:45:09 also is ur jet a custom
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:46:05 typhoon but with 2 vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:46:10 In what way
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:46:56 do you happen to use default mouse controls by chance
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:47:15 keybind your control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:48:04 Psm at its finest
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:48:43 No it’s Belkan magic
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:49:06 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:49:11 Belkan witchcraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:49:57 reverse flight in plane crazy <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:51:21 no it’s just this chat
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:51:50 hunting season came early
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:52:37 the fucking
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:54:43 Wouldn’t it be easier to just insert a map in instead
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:55:25 I don’t feel very safe saying it in this server so ima dm you it
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:57:34 Malnourished f22
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:58:01 is that your build by chance
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:58:36 die
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:58:42 arson berd
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 07:59:04 how fast does your plane fly
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:00:07 wow that is slow as hell
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:00:15 My jets go 1500 minimum
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:00:34 conveyor engines are cringe
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:01:14 anyways the detail on that raptor can be greatly improved
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:02:23 I can see many ways to improve that raptor
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:03:53 first thing fix the wings
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:06:09 Imagine the lag
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:06:32 3 fps gaming
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:07:03 gundam
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 08:07:04 idk
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 20:52:29 I wonder if rick actually reads suggestions chat
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 20:53:04 I guess he's saving the suggestions for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 20:53:15 same
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 21:09:43 drag
plane-crazy 2022-04-22 19:54:04 sus flanker
general 2022-04-22 20:00:14 pcc at its finest
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 04:44:21 you probably accidentally angled a camera
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:02:25 why does that jet look like its malnourished
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:02:55 do you not realize that the vertical stabilizer **gives a plane stable roll**
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:13 literally if your plane is too heavy **make it out of ice**
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:23 does your aircraft spin out whenever you roll
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:34 it gives it more stable roll
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:52 do you have vertically placed wing panels anywhere in the jet
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:08 send a vid of it rolling
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:16 I refuse to believe that
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:46 so you do have vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:05:00 that explains why
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:05:42 that looks nothing like the x36
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:05:52 I dont see any inspiration taken from it
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:06:14 there is a reason fighter jets have tails
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:06:28 and you apparently cant see it
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:06:57 please go say that to a lockheed martin aircraft designer
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:07:00 I dare you
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:07:18 like just go to some engineer working at boeing or lockheed and say it to their faces
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:07:22 watch as they laugh at you
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:07:56 there isnt a thing called flight computers in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:08:16 IF THERE WAS A THING CALLED FLIGHT COMPUTERS ALL OF MY JETS WOULD HAVE GOD MISSILE TRACKING
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:02 atleast a dart has vertical slabs
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:33 please go ahead and add a flight computer and tvc onto a small jet
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:40 please just try it out
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:57 do you mean ailerons and canards?
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:23 idiot those are elevators
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:37 they control pitch and nothing else
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:53 THERE IS A REASON WHY A VERTICAL STABILIZER HAS THE NAME STABILIZER IN IT
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:59 IT STABILIZES SHIT
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:11:32 I think he saw a plane without a vertical stabilizer and went "wow unstable plane cool I want make"
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:12:23 thats called a ruddervator, and ruddervators are angled 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:12:38 is that related
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:12:57 your supposed ruddervators arent even angled 45 theyre literally flat
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:13:48 this guy would make a tailless jet irl and have it fight something like a flanker
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:14:17 thats the vertical stabilizer idiot
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:15:03 not needed unless you dont want to die
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:15:13 something tells me you either conned your way through or bribed a mod
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:16:28 look at the B2 bomber and tell me if it can do roll maneuvers
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:17:44 idiot the thing would lose control and crash
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:18:36 **nor are they designed for aerial engagements at all**
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:18:58 they invest all of their money into stealth or speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:19:07 so they cant get shot down so easily
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:19:25 **which means it cant fucking roll**
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:19:30 braindead child
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:09 IT HELPS FUCKING STABILIZE THE VERTICAL AXIS YOU SHITHEAD
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:37 BECAUSE YOU HAVE GODDAMN SMALL VERTICAL STABILIZERS
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:38 THATS WHY
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:51 THEY STILL CANT ROLL IN PLANE CRAZY
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:15 UNLESS YOU HAVE TVC ON A B2 AND SOPHISTICATED FLIGHT COMPUTERS YOU CANT ROLL ON A GODDAMN B2
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:34 thats BECAUSE YOU HAVE VERTICAL STABILIZERS YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:41 THE SMALL 1X1 THINGS
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:54 GOD FUCKING DAMMIT HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO DRILL IT IN YOUR HEAD
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:22:20 ITS CERTAINLY HARDER TO ROLL WITHOUT VERTICAL STABILIZERS THAN WITH ONE
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:22:56 irl the spinning from losing control would make him black out
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:23:15 like imagine your head being thrown all across the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:24:11 he saw a scale model of an x36 which made him think vertical slabs are useless
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:26:55 we lectured a small child on flight physics
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:28:03 I think we actually enlightened a small uneducated peasant
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:28:32 which is why I cam lock
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:30:30 conveyor engines are glitchy and have no throttle
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:30:41 hover engines are stabler and have throttle
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:00 also people use them more than conv engines nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:20 Conv engines mostly are used only for ships nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:30 if you want a pvp jet or something go for hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:49 really rare to see conveyor engine fighters now
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:31:59 people seem to like hover more
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:32:18 a hover engine can easily escape a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:32:28 with controlled throttle too
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:33:04 I’ve only seen one and that is the destroyer mig
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:05 I would only use conveyors on large builds like ships
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:20 good luck, you’ll need it
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:34:54 anyways so I’m a hover drive fanboy
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:35:44 it’s hilarious to use them but in the end I can only see them being used on ships or doing a little trolling
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:36:13 a
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:36:48 Do you have servo on
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:36:56 are the motors clipping anything
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:38:59 gnight
general 2022-04-26 08:40:13 good question
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:41:36 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 08:41:39 it always was
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 05:14:48 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 05:15:01 why
plane-crazy 2022-04-30 06:08:59 It’s a sukhoi, just a really messed up one
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 03:50:10 how long has it been since rick announced PC2
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 03:53:36 do you think he actually will release it this summer
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:28:02 isnt pc hardcoded
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:28:40 its hard to update the game when the code is hardcoded
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:28:54 there is a reason that he's making pc2
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:29:11 he's gonna softcode pc2 so its easier to update
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:29:35 (updating the game is like walking through a minefield)
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:29:49 thats gonna happen
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:29:58 pc2 is an update of pc1
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:30:29 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:30:46 depresshin
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:31:04 same goes with removing glitch engines like hover drives
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:31:21 I will personally incite a mob if that happens
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:32:21 whats the redacted
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:32:44 scrap mechanic?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:33:21 ve hacle crator or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:33:47 the dev got pissed that he couldnt join pc2 development and made a pc ripoff lmao
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:34:16 lma!
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:34:47 another century
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:34:53 the next century maybe
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:35:23 real talk though didn't he say it would be released this summer
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:35:40 pretty sure he got pissed off at pc2 dev team
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:36:44 in 3 years
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:36:46 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:02 wdym by 3
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:04 3 months?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:06 3 years?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:08 3 decades?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:27 no you shit rick would be dead
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:37:38 along with the rest of the dev team
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:38:07 ah yes start a family business dedicated to re coding an entire game
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:38:29 2
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:38:49 im gonna assume its 3 months
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:39:11 what the fuck do you mean by 3
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:39:24 include a measurement unit
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:39:40 3
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 18:39:40 okay
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 18:40:31 go for an f16 or f18
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 18:40:39 crackhead nimble airframes
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 18:40:56 so nimble to the point you can barely control them
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 18:58:26 atleast you have slightly better pitch
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:02:03 Depends
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:02:13 Just keep experimenting until you get what you want
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:12:33 PC2 when<:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:12:53 what
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:13:11 is it because summer is in 2 days or something
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:13:34 No update in <#529858892075761694>  in over 2 months <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:17:19 I place 2 monopoly dollars that it isn’t gonna release this summer
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:17:50 July 4 2069
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:18:37 time to scavenge
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:18:44 actually what features did he say
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:18:58 But what did he say exactly
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:19:30 literally just don’t cook the rice at all
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:20:28 woah
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:21:32 Imagine he has an admin console and whenever he joins a server he can just cause a massive storm and wipe everything out of the sky
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:23:12 *ends up getting picked up by a tornado*
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:23:51 good point
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:24:49 Why is it that autocorrect thought femboy was felony
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:27:45 Bet it exists on webtoons
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:28:48 lmao imagine if that weather is constant and can’t be turned off
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:28:59 imagine trying to dogfight in a storm
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:30:43 If plane crazy has guided missiles it would be an interesting stealth mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:31:13 like good guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:31:16 long range ones
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:31:35 for funnier chaos
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:34:16 Like in ace combat you can hide in the clouds
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:34:23 to avoid missiles
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:36:11 Fly head on and juke them out
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:36:55 honestly though cloud cover and better missiles would be a pretty cool mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:37:59 Too big and ineffective in dogfights
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:43:29 Debatable topic
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:43:43 Tanks in my opinion do a better job
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:44:19 It looks like 2 cats fighting in an alleyway wdym
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:45:02 That’s if you can aim at a long distance <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:45:35 Then they’ll maul you

plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:46:37 what the fuck is that
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:46:59 so heavy it loses the ability to fly
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:47:11 I see a McDonald’s happy meal box on wheels
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:47:36 Belkans
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:47:41 and their witchcraft
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:47:46 and UAVS
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:48:05 That’s if you know how to bomb them in the air
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:49:14 Depends on how many bombs you fit
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:49:38 Do I see **drones**
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:50:28 plane crazy needs weapon uavs
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:50:53 I’ll do it when flight computers exist
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:51:00 Unmanned plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:51:03 pretty much it
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:51:15 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:51:51 it just needs a basic little program to fly
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:52:08 dies
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:52:17 no weapon uavs
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:52:18 sad
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:52:47 Kundez hospital strike
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:53:33 imagine if he added it and the uavs were just copies of user made builds in the server
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:53:43 The one guy in the pvp fighter:
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:54:12 Or a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:56:48 Doesn’t seem like it
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 01:57:01 Send game link to me
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 05:51:23 nice fullback <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:50:15 the year 7644?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:50:45 humanity might not exist by then lma
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:51:17 for the sole purpose of witnessing the release of pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:51:29 and then they go extinct
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 18:51:56 the prophecy has been revealed
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:05:34 question why are you using cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:05:46 arsenal bird <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:05:56 its either that you arent in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:05:58 or you're flying too fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:06:04 cutters dont work at high speeds
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 19:06:29 ok?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 01:42:58 Why
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 01:43:19 how could you abuse the Berkut like this

plane-crazy 2022-06-02 03:42:35 ok sure
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:09:22 First of all what is that supposed to be
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:09:39 several things wrong with it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:09:46 intake shape isn’t right
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:09:55 Vertical slabs too close together
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:10:12 The vertical stabilizers are too close
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:10:15 Engines too
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:10:25 Yak 152<:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:11:08 the f15 is supposed to look like a brick why is there half wedge 1x1 on top of the intakes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:11:19 Scale is way too small
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:11:31 Spread the engines 1 block apart
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:12:13 show me it in build mode
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:13:26 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:14:29 what mech you making
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:15:00 Would also look wacky
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:15:25 do you want the cloth to move
general 2022-06-03 08:15:34 what game
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:15:46 just use half blocks and wedges
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:16:27 use half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:17:32 you making a graze?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:18:43 I see
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:27:01 make it glow
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 02:27:25 silenced tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 20:22:12 beautiful

plane-crazy 2022-06-07 01:09:32 send
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 01:10:03 Summarize what he said
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 01:11:18 oof ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 02:36:59 fold your wings while doing aerobatic maneuvers
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 02:37:30 like fully folded before and during flight
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:06:22 summer has officially started
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:07:51 anyways PC2 still doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:08:37 so not released to the public?
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:10:24 how so
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 00:40:23 what kind of mech
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 00:41:02 humanoid shape or looks like a tank with legs
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 00:42:18 
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 01:03:33 it was invincible until some peg legs guy in a red mobile suit beat the living shit out of that gundam
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 17:45:24 Just turn off speakers
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 18:41:26 I hate it thanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 04:29:17 no more borders
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 21:34:39 (he is 12)
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 02:30:35 how does a fish choke on exhaust it’s literally underwater
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:14:34 name says it all, rip you to shreds
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:15:03 anti aircraft guns aren’t effective in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:15:31 they aren’t mobile and you have to compensate for bullet drop and try to predict where the air target is going to be
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:16:23 you don’t
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:16:33 just dogfight them like a normal person
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:16:35 Or use a tank
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:17:03 tanks are a good way to take down shredders
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:17:38 shredders are shit at air to ground since they are melee oriented and once they touch the ground they are just sitting ducks
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:17:42 die
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:18:05 no you buffoon you aren’t any better than the shredder if you do that
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:18:25 killing a shredder with a tank is a good way to kill it and disrespect it at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:18:32 using cutters throws away the disrespect
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:19:28 use an aircraft for that
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:19:37 they cant fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:20:49 can what
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:20:58 shredder balls are way easier to kill
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:21:23 yes so dogfight them
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:21:32 they have a funny habit of stopping to shoot at you
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:21:49 so you just shove purebred missile spam up their ass when they stop to aim
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:22:30 I don’t get why you want to leave every time you see a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:22:55 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:22:57 fight them
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:23:25 skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:24:19 shredders are just shit at the game despite using a far more powerful build
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:24:46 some bastard in a Mach 3 shredder ball lost to a fucking degenerate in a Mach 1.5 F15E
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:24:54 he had tnt armour and shit too
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:25:36 heck they are so shit at the game they lose to inferior builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:26:49 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:27:01 that’s just unnecessary
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:27:19 90 degrees is in the realm of being unable to control your aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:28:25 I keep mines default at 45
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:28:45 except for when the airframe is actually well balanced which I set it lower to 30 or 25
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:31:10 woah funny aerobatic plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:36:13 cobra is not effective at all I’ll just tell you that
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:36:30 even if you do a cobra in front of another aircraft it won’t help you one bit
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:37:10 dude can just circle back with his nickel radius pitch rate and come back for your ass
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:41:04 my F4E says otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:41:36 thing can lose half of the entire aircraft and still put up a fight
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:46:49 pick a good airframe
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:01:50 +missing engine
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:02:55 both engines seem relatively intact
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:04:09 they already exist
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:04:16 not as a block though
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 23:44:50 ciws turret but it’s manned
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 23:51:45 you making tvc?
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 23:53:02 wow ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 00:07:54 when I first saw that I thought it was a pw mki
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 00:08:41 I see

general 2022-07-07 01:11:29 what did sir bubbington do anyways
general 2022-07-07 01:11:47 wow he
general 2022-07-07 01:12:02 a
general 2022-07-07 01:12:17 aside from that what did they do
general 2022-07-07 01:12:58 huh
general 2022-07-07 01:14:06 wow ok
general 2022-07-07 01:14:40 general is a shithole time to leave
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 02:31:28 what the hell is that
plane-crazy 2022-07-08 02:31:39 why is that so shiny
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 02:07:05 balls
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:34:28 people are already analyzing it wow
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:37:09 atleast we know there’s a highway
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:42:07 playerbase is starved of PC2 leaks
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:45:06 Interior feels rather bland
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:46:17 add a little more detail to the interior like overhead baggage storage and carpet
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:47:16 also make business class and first class feel a little more luxurious, like using richer Colors and fabric for the walls
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:18:12 what the
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:18:29 Your roasts are shit they don’t even make sense
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:21:50 how old are you
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:22:18 ofc he doesn’t respond to me question
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:22:59 and how old are you?
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:23:20 I’m just an Asian
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:24:00 your pfp reflects on your inability to make good roasts or even talk like a normal person without a speech impediment
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:24:39 that’s a problem, you should fix it
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:26:54 go back to those cnp games here in pcc we already have enough dumbasses like you we don’t need more
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:27:42 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:28:02 You’re probably younger than 14 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:28:13 Stop acting like you’re older
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:29:06 yours is probably at baseline 60
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:29:21 121 actually
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 19:29:46 even so if it was at 91 I would still be smarter <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 20:55:03 top gun reference!1!1??1?1?1??1!1??1
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 23:42:43 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 23:42:57 if they use cutters like how a shredder uses one then they are shredders
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 23:43:36 People only name certain shredders as anti shredders is so they can appeal to more people and not get verbally beaten to death
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 23:44:11 In the end they're just some variant of the shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:33:39 interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:33:43 May I see a clip of it
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:49:23 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:49:31 hitboxes are crap
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:49:38 motorlock is still relevant
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 17:45:48 IRST?
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 17:45:54 use a sparkler
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 02:37:50 Painful
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 04:25:42 my god
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 04:25:48 that is massive

plane-crazy 2022-07-19 04:16:14 the dude who made it combined it with ballasts and such to make it do maneuvers like that
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 21:31:39 Never
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 21:32:10 Rick is taking his sweet ass time making PC2
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 21:39:48 what help do you need
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 21:41:01 DM me a pic
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 04:59:04 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:13:01 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:13:10 VTOL warthog
general 2022-08-06 00:31:03 laptop version is only 4% better than a GTX 950
general 2022-08-06 00:31:52 and that's the max q version
general 2022-08-06 00:31:59 imagine the regular one
general 2022-08-06 00:32:21 I'm just saying
general 2022-08-06 00:33:08 #1 at self destruction
general 2022-08-06 00:33:25 Also a shit ton of real estate companies are collapsing
general 2022-08-06 00:33:32 From people not paying mortgage
general 2022-08-06 00:33:42 china is taking a big blow rn
general 2022-08-06 00:33:54 So big that it's apparently affecting the west
general 2022-08-06 00:34:32 they're getting tanks out because they think the protests that the citizens have been doing is a political protest
general 2022-08-06 00:34:52 Tiananmen square 2: the electric boogaloo
general 2022-08-06 00:34:59 they're also limiting withdrawals
general 2022-08-06 00:35:09 And banks are also apparently losing trust
general 2022-08-06 00:35:46 they're trading food
general 2022-08-06 00:36:10 I watched a video where companies are trading produce because the economy has gone to shit
general 2022-08-06 00:36:18 Idk if it's real or not
general 2022-08-06 00:36:33 my god their economy is fucked
general 2022-08-06 00:36:57 also while in the midst of this chaos they're doing military is doing exercises around Taiwan
general 2022-08-06 00:37:35 and apparently if china fires on Taiwan the US is ready to intervene
general 2022-08-06 00:38:01 their reasons for a potential invasion is painfully similar to Russia's Ukraine invasion
general 2022-08-06 00:38:44 we must reclaim Taiwan from American pigs

-ccp probably
general 2022-08-06 00:39:16 Honestly I think china is gonna be fucked if the US intervenes
general 2022-08-06 00:40:03 so what are your thoughts if china really does a funny to Taiwan and america decides to join in
general 2022-08-06 00:40:20 what
general 2022-08-06 00:41:21 shits gonna go down
general 2022-08-06 00:41:39 China might be desperate enough to go the nuclear option
general 2022-08-06 00:41:44 In my opinion
general 2022-08-06 00:41:54 They've done some really random shit in the past
general 2022-08-06 00:42:29 anything nuclear is concerning
general 2022-08-06 00:42:56 I would like a democratic china that doesn't ban me from watching maxor on YouTube
general 2022-08-06 00:43:07 or ban me from any western site at all
general 2022-08-06 00:43:17 Canadian born chinese
general 2022-08-06 00:43:30 Chinese guy in Canada
general 2022-08-06 00:43:51 I do visit for 3 weeks during the summer every year
general 2022-08-06 00:44:25 Being unable to browse reddit and go on YouTube for 3 weeks almost drove me insane
general 2022-08-06 00:44:50 problem is I'm practically illiterate
general 2022-08-06 00:45:22 Are you talking about their propaganda vids
general 2022-08-06 00:45:55 hired from where lol
general 2022-08-06 00:46:35 north Korea is like an incomplete game
general 2022-08-06 00:46:42 it feels so artificial
general 2022-08-06 00:46:48 So uncanny
general 2022-08-06 00:47:18 haha north Korean mig 29
general 2022-08-06 00:47:40 their electricity in cities are unstable from what I heard
general 2022-08-06 00:47:59 Kimmy is trying to live his fantasy of being a leader
general 2022-08-06 00:48:27 this channel went political real fast
general 2022-08-06 00:48:49 Slave labour probably
general 2022-08-06 00:48:59 You can visit north Korea from china fun fact
general 2022-08-06 00:50:01 The reason north Korea hasn't been invaded by USA is because china will intervene. Because they are afraid that US influence is right at their borders
general 2022-08-06 00:50:53 yeah but it's kinda like a stalemate there
general 2022-08-06 00:52:14 you have quite the sadistic view of life
general 2022-08-06 00:53:33 but wasn't that crisis back in 2013
general 2022-08-06 00:53:50 figured
general 2022-08-06 00:55:24 oh shit according to the doomsday clock we're 100 seconds from midnight
general 2022-08-06 00:55:30 ahaha we're all gonna die
general 2022-08-06 00:56:01 2022 sure is a turbulent year
general 2022-08-06 00:56:10 So much so that I'm gonna witness doomsday
general 2022-08-06 01:03:51 you can post suggestions using a command but you need to be a certain rank in order to do that
general 2022-08-06 01:04:11 read the pinned there
general 2022-08-06 01:06:09 everything is fine as long as I'm the most detached from the situation <:thoink:657279634563399720>
general 2022-08-06 01:06:25 PC2?
general 2022-08-06 01:06:56 there has been evidence of playtests of the game but no clear release date
general 2022-08-06 01:07:03 no exact date
general 2022-08-06 01:07:14 Rick hasn't been meeting his deadlines very well
general 2022-08-06 01:07:28 apparently it was supposed to release last summer
general 2022-08-06 01:07:45 check <#529858892075761694>
general 2022-08-06 01:08:03 there's been one image of moving lava with a highway in the background
general 2022-08-06 01:08:32 didn't they say the game was 75% done last year
general 2022-08-06 01:08:41 PC2 devs
general 2022-08-06 01:08:53 good question
general 2022-08-06 01:09:19 Madattak and Rick
general 2022-08-06 01:09:34 also he released a thing on devforums where he was hiring map builders
general 2022-08-06 01:10:33 Being able to mod textures is great
general 2022-08-06 01:10:52 I heard from somewhere that he was helping with PC2
general 2022-08-06 01:12:02 Forgot those existed
general 2022-08-06 01:12:03 Welp
general 2022-08-06 01:13:29 keep waiting
general 2022-08-06 01:13:56 I want texture
general 2022-08-06 01:16:00 texture blocks and radar and missiles that don't have shit tracking need to exist
general 2022-08-06 01:16:54 Block where you can put custom images and stuff on it
general 2022-08-06 01:17:03 actually should be called a decal block
general 2022-08-06 01:17:07 yeah I'm stupid
general 2022-08-06 01:18:10 The tracking is shit also having custom missiles would be fair because they would have better tracking
general 2022-08-06 01:18:51 Rick said motorlock would exist in pc2
general 2022-08-06 01:19:48 just make a small 4 block guided missile with with an explosive block those things already deal enough damage
general 2022-08-06 01:20:08 4-8 blocks
general 2022-08-06 01:20:30 I forgot to count in propulsion
general 2022-08-06 01:21:46 there's going to be some psycho with a mach 18 missile with a guidance system mounted on a plane if that block is going to exist in pc2
general 2022-08-06 01:22:30 Cluster bombs
general 2022-08-06 01:23:30 some guy is going to make a UAV with a cluster bomb that has a 4 plot blast radius and there's nothing we can do about it
general 2022-08-06 01:24:27 don't do it
general 2022-08-06 01:25:44 thinking about a suicide UAV going after me is already scary enough
general 2022-08-06 01:26:30 oh god
general 2022-08-06 01:27:48 Thrust vectoring bullshit
general 2022-08-06 01:28:56 if it overshoots at all it just comes back for your ass
general 2022-08-06 01:29:17 the fear
general 2022-08-06 01:30:32 Imagine the hell pvp will be if players have the ability to make autonomous combat vehicles
general 2022-08-06 01:30:49 it's ace combat 7 all over again
general 2022-08-06 01:31:30 It would be fun to fight
general 2022-08-06 01:32:43 Instead of pink missiles it's osean F/A 18Es trying to kill you
general 2022-08-06 01:33:03 yes
general 2022-08-06 01:33:21 they've been a thing for a while
general 2022-08-06 01:33:48 SAMs?
general 2022-08-06 01:33:55 sounds fun
general 2022-08-06 01:34:06 sounds really fun
general 2022-08-06 01:34:48 maybe public server pvp will be fun for once
general 2022-08-06 01:35:23 time and determination
general 2022-08-06 01:37:04 imagine everyone in a server had UAV fighter squadrons and you're the only guy with a regular manned jet
general 2022-08-06 01:37:52 I'm talking about using the guidance block that you mentioned
general 2022-08-06 01:38:27 it's unmanned and it's flying
general 2022-08-06 01:40:41 assuming you can hit it
general 2022-08-06 01:42:11 yes
general 2022-08-06 02:08:52 What is that
general 2022-08-06 02:09:09 molested by project aces
general 2022-08-06 22:10:56 art school is a waste of money
general 2022-08-06 22:17:07 From what I’ve heard being an entrepreneur isn’t easy
general 2022-08-06 22:17:50 yeah a lot of businesses that didn’t take off
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 01:52:39 F15 if you want a good all rounder aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 22:25:23 two bots warn me
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 22:26:25 those shredders suck at hitting anything
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 22:26:45 it's like a shredder ball and a sword bug bred but the offspring had a birth defect
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 22:48:24 anyways killing them is fun like any shredder
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 22:48:31 they can't hit anything
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:43:31 but what about Americans
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:44:13 and I'm guessing Canadians fall under the rule of the queen as they have a representative of the queen in their parliament
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:44:38 But aren't they a bit too powerful to be killed off now
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:46:12 Which era of America are we going by
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:46:43 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:47:44 what about japan, China, Russia, Israel, Pakistan, Vietnam, Mongolia, Ukraine, Serbia, and Russia
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:48:38 I don't recall those countries having any ties with the royal family
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:49:06 Yeah but what about China
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:49:33 they currently aren't being influenced by any British rule
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:50:01 JF 17 nerds
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:50:18 No 5th gen planes
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:50:34 Shitty chinese engineering
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:51:10 what is going on anymore
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:51:20 one guy claiming Britain rules over the world
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:51:29 random politics

plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:56:46 Walter white
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:57:21 this is getting weird
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:58:18 really good question
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 23:58:56 my nationality is Canadian, I am chinese, but I have a trump supporter cap
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:00:16 I don't like him too much
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:00:24 I wore the cap as a joke
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:00:49 changing the topic it's been a while since a hall of fame build has been posted
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:01:14 I'm seeing a lot of shitty builds recently
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:01:35 what
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:02:07 lots of roscale type builds are flooding the creations channel
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:03:45 they werent bound by warcrimes
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:03:56 or a treaty
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:04:35 thin walls on apartments, weird working mentality, loyalty to a company
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:04:58 it kinda is
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:05:06 Also there's a lot of earthquakes
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:05:31 shut in neets are a pretty common thing now
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:05:58 depends on which company you work for
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:06:16 there's white companies that have good policies and black companies that make you work your ass off
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:06:34 with corrupt management and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:06:42 not referencing Africans
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:06:48 that's what they're called
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:06:54 White companies and black companies
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:07:17 it's like white hat hackers and black hat hackers
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:07:25 but companies
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:07:43 Puff saw me type black and got a little offended
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:08:17 anyways so in Asia you have to study and pass a test in order to get into a high school
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:08:45 entrance tests are a nightmare according to my Asian relatives
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 00:09:34 <:empty:794431705070174238>

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 04:32:16 a bit thick
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 04:32:28 put it on a diet
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 04:32:44 I said put the plane on a diet not you
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 22:40:48 Angle lock witchcraft
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 22:41:17 then cry
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 22:41:21 Because you can't angle lock
general 2022-09-10 00:11:53 what happened
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:28:06 I have some hopes that PC2 is going to release this year
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:28:28 Rick released a decent amount of map images this year
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:28:43 so the map seems to have a good portion be done
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 05:29:37 (2 is a lot to me considering how rare Rick posts on there)
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:25:27 It was never meant to be realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:25:42 it's an arcade flight combat game
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:25:51 Not a simulator like DCS
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:26:22 Hmm yes waste 5 years of your life just to get uptiered
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:26:54 that's your opinion
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:27:03 not everything has to be over realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:27:18 if you don't like it then don't buy it
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:27:50 gets a virus
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:28:01 bro if you don't like ace combat just don't play it
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:28:19 you just hate the game because it costs money from what it seems
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:28:28 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:28:51 war thunder bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:29:08 Even sim combat players understand ace combat isn't meant to be realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:30:01 in game purchases limit your enjoyment
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:30:10 either way you're spending money on both games
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:30:31 like I said
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:30:38 Ace combat was never meant to be a flight sim
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:30:47 Stop hating it for something it was never meant to mimic
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:31:06 your entire argument is that it costs money and isn't realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:31:50 even DCS and war thunder players understand that ace combat isn't flight sim
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:33:40 when a "whitename" is more logical than a person with more than two roles
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:34:20 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:34:40 why not bring your dumb argument about how it isn't realistic up
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:35:00 ace combat and wingman are same genre
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 22:01:22 radar guided motor 2 missiles

plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:40:12 probably is lets be honest
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:41:02 I never said it was going to be released then
general 2022-09-13 01:42:43 soggy beef patty slapped onto dejected looking buns
general 2022-09-13 01:43:08 spicy chicken burgers and pizza are the only good foods at my school
general 2022-09-13 01:43:12 and the fries
general 2022-09-13 01:43:40 rip
general 2022-09-13 01:43:46 that sucks
general 2022-09-13 01:44:10 my schools spicy chicken burger actually has some spice
general 2022-09-13 01:44:17 like you can feel a decent tingle in your mouth
general 2022-09-13 01:47:55 I wonder how long the reign of a 70+ year old man is going to last
general 2022-09-13 01:48:14 before he turns into dust
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 05:04:26 No it's dogshit
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 05:04:41 All minis are dogshit change my mind

creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:35:42 he never said it was a tomcat
creations-chat 2022-09-18 03:35:33 you are stupid it appears
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 00:47:12 your brain basically fucks itself
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 00:47:22 you are unable to use your brain properly
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 00:47:30 you are mentally disabled from living so long
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 00:47:48 sums up dementia pretty well
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 00:48:18 looks like we found someone with dementia
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:13:46 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:14:07 let me give you an analysis done by a stupid person
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:14:24 so starting off almost every person on this planet that plays genshin likes 5 star characters
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:14:35 5 stars have a 0.1% chance (or lower) of dropping through pulls
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:14:52 now if you roll 70 or so times you are guaranteed to have a 5 star
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:15:30 however theres 26 5 star characters
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:15:50 so an additional 1 in 26 chance that you get your waifu
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:15:55 in short
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:15:57 dont play genshin
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:15:58 its shit
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:16:14 you are going to waste a shit ton of money trying to get your png wife
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:16:42 gameplay wise is like breath of the wild
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:17:41 I don't play gacha games at all
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:17:53 I got all of this information from watching my sister get sucked into the genshin rabbit hole
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:18:16 nah she already quit after 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:18:21 she tried to suck me in
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:18:33 but I didn't have the mental capacity and motivation to play a gacha game
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:18:50 she's getting obsessed with stardew valley
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:19:13 so anyways she tried to suck me in by buying me an account with a 5 star keqing
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:19:28 of course I wanted to be a degenerate and play beamng more
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:20:05 I see her roll once every 3 weeks
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:20:17 after she finishes grinding on her computer
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:20:40 oh **wait wait wait there's more**
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:20:48 5 STAR CHARACTERS ARE LIMITED EDITION
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:21:12 SO THERES A CHANCE YOU WONT GET YOUR CATGIRL SWORDSMAN
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:21:19 BECAUSE ITS LIMITED EDITION
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:21:41 so yeah this is why I play sandbox
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:21:58 if I see some cool shit I go make it myself
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:22:49 I think the only time I ever got into a gacha game was when I was playing that one transformers street fighting game
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:22:59 I somehow rolled a shit ton of top tier characters
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:23:11 and then I quit after a week
plane-crazy 2022-09-22 17:25:54 we are more water than human

plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:49:21 I can make it go 3k but the block count would be too high
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:50:03 I put a lot of hovers to see how fast my jet would go, ended up accidentally discovering it can hit over 2650
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 01:50:15 I think I wanted it to go roughly 1.5k sps

creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:41:36 So why are they wasting their military resources on untrained troops and not experienced personnel considering they want to take over Ukraine swiftly, your point does not make sense
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:44:27 then don’t post in PCC
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:46:48 But they certainly are better than Russian flying shitboxes so they don’t suck as much <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:05:05 best public server nammu flanker:
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:05:16 no but he is
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:05:33 The creature
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:05:47 I have more but they aren’t on my phone
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:06:05 Yeah he literally said that
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:06:16 man I love strapping ICBMs onto my plane
plane-crazy 2022-11-20 02:06:52 Going through public pvp is the best
general 2022-11-21 01:47:16 who the fuck are you
general 2022-11-21 01:47:50 huh?
general 2022-11-21 01:47:51 who are you
general 2022-11-21 01:48:05 no seriously who are you
general 2022-11-21 01:48:16 I don't remember a single thing about knowing you
general 2022-11-21 01:48:26 what?
general 2022-11-21 01:48:35 why the fuck did you ping me then?
general 2022-11-21 01:49:22 yeah no this guy is high on some sort of narcotic
general 2022-11-21 01:49:25 I'm out
general 2022-11-21 01:58:36 faiv billion rocket to bomb donetsk children
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 04:04:38 the chinese private police station down the block won’t like that
help 2022-11-23 21:38:39 yeah the UAV block basically adds shit like autonomous loitering, automatic targetting, and a bunch of other cool shit
help 2022-11-23 21:39:23 it also has automatic flight correction n shit
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:06:39 does anyone know how long it took to develop plane crazy and how many lines of code are in it
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:23:51 certain blocks ice would make that block heavier
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:54:51 that spine bruh
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:57:36 no the canopy and spine, this is how an F-15 canopy should look like
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:57:53 you see the problem here
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:58:09 no it makes your eagle look weird
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:58:32 no
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:58:39 it looks like a fullback
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:00:08 at least it looks more like an eagle than whatever that was
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:00:35 also you can move the canopy backwards into the lock tower to mitigate that
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:00:52 also why are you using half wedge down 1x1s use half wedge down 1x2s
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:12 now move the intakes back
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:23 also you can paint the exposed lock to the spine colour to hide it
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:33 thats what I did with this eagle
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:44 not a lot
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:50 I’ve made 3 eagles
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:59 its not hard
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:02:31 use a different lock tower instead of the namnam guide tower<:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:03:53 his videos are nice but his guides and his obsessive fans are annoying as fuck and bad
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:04:56 bitch they think that the namnam su 27 is the best plane and if you disagree they’ll question if you know anything about PVP at all
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:05:23 also they think M2M is the best control system and its just fucking wrong
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:06:07 *m2m this, namnam guide that* fuck this shit I am going to rip their intestines out
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:06:42 motor2mouse
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:07:13 basically mouse controlled motor2s that control the aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:07:32 reject M2M, embrace glitched mouse trim
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:08:40 m2m is the hardest control system to put on my existing planes
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:08:59 because they’re already tuned for glitched mouse and WASD
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:10:10 is it the moving nozzles kind or actual full on TVC
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:10:55 didn’t gjsolo make one
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:11:18 that actually works or something
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:11:34 hollow aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:11:55 I have something that is similar to TVC
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:12:05 but its basically just putting hover engines up and down
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:12:54 I’m not even sure if I can call that TVC at all
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:14:02 do you know what thrust vectoring is as a concept
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:14:23 so basically we’re doing the same thing but with hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:14:54 they’re most likely not giving that stuff out
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:15:40 hell you can’t put moving hover engines in one block spaces
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:16:01 so the only way you can really do TVC in my opinion is just strap hover engines facing up and down
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:16:23 unless I am proven wrong
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:35:47 This is so cursed
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:35:00 thats it being shitty
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:35:07 its supposed to track targets
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 04:50:17 man should just turn off roblox volume lmao
general 2022-12-03 21:16:40 keep in mind the raptor does air to air better than any other fighter
general 2022-12-03 21:25:51 go ahead reformer, dogfight an F-35

**you just have to get within visual range first**
general 2022-12-03 21:26:21 knockoff abrams to avoid General Dynamics going after your ass
general 2022-12-03 21:26:46 literally was a flight science test version without half of the systems that make it a superplane
general 2022-12-03 21:27:13 this is what happens when you mix social media military programs
general 2022-12-03 21:27:27 but seriously though the F-35 is good
general 2022-12-03 21:27:38 better than whatever russia can offer <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-03 21:28:29 something tells me this guy likes the su 57 better
general 2022-12-03 21:30:21 the F-35 is deemed as a "failure" to media because they always want interesting stories without bothering to fact check anything
general 2022-12-03 21:30:39 agreed
general 2022-12-03 21:30:42 shit-57
general 2022-12-03 21:31:22 even if it was in production it would still be a flying shitbox
general 2022-12-03 21:31:58 exposed engine fans
general 2022-12-03 21:32:55 I'm talking about the fact the intakes aren't serpentine intakes
general 2022-12-03 21:34:30 AMRAAM missiles are the trend now
general 2022-12-03 21:34:47 a 5th gen based on an outdated philosophy
general 2022-12-03 21:35:22 TOPGUNTOPGUNTOPGUNTOPGUNTOPGUN
general 2022-12-03 21:35:34 TOP GUN TOTALLY REAL DOGFIGHT
general 2022-12-03 21:36:13 you seem like the type of person to only equip heatseekers onto your plane in a BVR fight
general 2022-12-03 21:36:59 have the drones do the work
general 2022-12-03 21:38:09 https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/comments/z3i3np/output_skill_issue/

general 2022-12-03 21:41:05 don't forget lockheed putting lasers on F-35s and F-22s
general 2022-12-03 21:41:37 no like lasers that burn through missiles and planes and stuff
general 2022-12-03 21:41:51 it was called TALWS I think
general 2022-12-03 21:42:27 fun fact BAE systems almost made an F-35 with COFFIN
general 2022-12-03 21:43:29 they had one for threat evaluation
general 2022-12-03 22:00:41 halo
general 2022-12-03 22:02:04 the prototype armors literally looked like gundams
general 2022-12-03 22:02:57 don't worry the shoulder mounted gun will take care of that
general 2022-12-03 22:03:43 fact checked by liberals
general 2022-12-03 22:04:19 gun breaks off of mount and shoots him in the head
general 2022-12-03 22:04:55 kantanka also made knockoff bugattis
general 2022-12-03 22:06:04 what a great leader
general 2022-12-03 22:06:18 have a cult preacher as your co founder for an automobile company

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:08 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:17:37 my question is why would someone need to fly below the void

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:14 just for a little tomfoolery
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:18:39 ancient
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:08 why make a shredder go 15k speed bruh
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:14 cutters are useless at those speeds lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 02:20:52 so you just want to blitzkrieg using a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 01:20:37 how many people actually applied to be a PC2 dev
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 19:35:14 oh shoot I know the guy with the tiltrotor
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 06:46:45 PC2 still has a crap ton of development to undergo
