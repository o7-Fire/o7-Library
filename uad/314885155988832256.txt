general 2020-06-06 22:03:07 I once was in a match in realistic mode, the russian side, tier 2, flying a yak when we where on a tie with the enemy team and all that was left was a enemy bomber. So  me and a team of 2 decide to go after it because it was the only enemy plane on the team. Soon after 2 of the planes i mentioned early where shot down from above, because they where above the bomber and the guns are on top. So next thing that happened, i flew below the bomber which is its blind spot and shot the belly of the flying beast and before you know it, i ran out of ammo. So my next strategy was to FLY INTO THE BOMBERS WINGS, next thing that happened i clipped one of its wings in addition to clipping one of my own, but i manage to stabilize my aircarft and soon after, we win the match.
