The Tale of getwrecked_ (512830750073290765)
general 2022-12-07 21:59:17 it just hit me
general 2022-12-07 21:59:40 years after i built my most optimized tank tracks
general 2022-12-07 21:59:49 it hit me how excessively optimized they were
general 2022-12-07 22:02:13 who wants to read a story as to how excessively optimized my fastest pair of tank treads are?
general 2022-12-07 22:03:01 its not verbal, i meant typing it out
general 2022-12-07 22:05:01 its really dumb because the largest obsession and goal i have ever had in my life, was just because someone said "why are you using tank tracks in pvp, they're too laggy and slow to be good." For some reason, i took this personally
general 2022-12-07 22:07:28 did you know that Antarctica, yes one of the polar regions actually classifies as a desert?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:46:48 Im curious, will PC2 have logic by any chance?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:59:30 Can someone tell me if there will be logic in PC2 by any chance?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:59:47 I honestly want to try and make a “combustion” engine with sensors and pistons
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:05:26 Wdym?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:14:20 So there will be basic logic and logic gates?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:15:54 You can nake audios
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:16:20 But you can only use other people’s audio if their audio is under i think 5 seconds long?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:16:53 But you can upload any audio you want within the old length value that only you can use in any game
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:18:59 Wait will save files from Plane Crazy be transferred over to Plane Crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:20:07 It should
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:20:09 Eventually
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:21:02 I would help as a modeler (im very good imo) and try and help with animations maybe even a little bit of scripting but the thing is closed
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:44:10 I think they will

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:44:40 I think they will
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:44:55 (Its the poll in development)
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:45:00 Read what they said carefully
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:45:48 “If its changed it means all of your creations will have to be changed to fit on the new rails”
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:46:06 Honestly this feels like a hint to them transferring saves over
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:46:24 What has
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:46:53 Yeah will they be transferred?
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:47:10 Ive never checked the logs/announcements
