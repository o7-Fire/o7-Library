general 2020-08-12 06:27:41 The last lucid dream I had was of me and another person sneaking as refugees into a ruined ferry pier in my hometown just after WW2, even with era-appropriate police cars and other stuff. The dream made sense until we emerged in a modern-day housing estate.
general 2020-08-12 06:28:08 I could somewhat control what I was doing

general 2020-08-12 06:33:06 Another dream I remember vividly (not sure if it was lucid) was set in a The 5th Wave backdrop. Me and a bunch of others were soldiers who tried to desert and escape the military base. We stole a bus, piled on, and got chased by the antagonist general in a Humvee or some shit. He somehow smashed through the upper deck windscreen and just started this speech about how disappointed he is in all of us, smirking sarcastically all the way. The driver then decided to crash the bus into something, sending him flying out of the windscreen, but somehow none of us were affected by the impact. We then got away or some shit, can't remember.

general 2020-09-24 06:42:45 I just want paved roads lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:52:11 ih
bot-central 2020-09-25 05:57:16 -mapsuggest Adding onto Redjay’s suggestion above, I’d like to suggest that the new paved roads run through diverse terrains with a few landmarks (like a random lookout platform/bus stop/petrol station) on the way. 

For instance a two-lane road would run from a town/city, passing through a plain or desert before snaking through a snowy mountain range. 

Or perhaps a circular motorway would run across a strait on a large suspension bridge between two islands and a ravine (which already exists in a way) on a very high bridge, with multiple exits at important spots (e.g. spawn, airports, ports, cities/towns), with some coastal sections offering a lovely view of the sunset over the ocean, rays of golden light shining in between the palm trees.

This would encourage actual exploration and allow for maximum possibilities while playing with land vehicles like vans, lorries and even buses, which I feel are underrated/not as popular compared with planes and ships in this game.

general 2020-10-21 03:37:06 I had two goldfishes with those massive eyeballs on the sides of their heads. Both starved to death because they couldn’t see shit in front of then, including their food.
general 2020-10-21 03:38:35 Another one of my stupid goldfish had a stone stuck in its mouth because that nonce would eat anything. We got it out before he choked or starved or something.
general 2020-10-21 03:39:15 Natural selection
general 2020-10-21 03:39:31 The last goldfish survived with me for at least four years
general 2020-10-21 03:39:39 Because that guy was smart
general 2020-10-21 03:40:25 Turtle?
general 2020-10-21 03:40:46 The ocean-going pillocks, as James May once said
general 2020-10-21 03:41:10 Yes
general 2020-10-21 03:41:19 And they eat them before spitting them back out

general 2020-10-21 03:42:18 Minced up food inside as well anyway
general 2020-10-21 03:43:19 I’m supposed to be listening to my prof on Zoom but I am not.
general 2020-10-21 03:46:27 it is he
general 2020-10-21 03:46:35 he is
general 2020-10-21 03:48:32 Somehow my shitty, barely functional bus has managed to get 65 points.
general 2020-10-21 03:48:34 why
general 2020-10-21 03:49:13 I have never realised that, thank you for bringing that to my attention.
general 2020-10-21 03:49:23 I will never sleep in peace again.

general 2020-10-21 03:52:31 can confirm
general 2020-10-21 03:52:42 Mosty because as time passes I realise just how shit they are
general 2020-10-21 03:53:09 That’ll buff out
general 2020-10-21 03:54:41 That is indeed something you haven’t accounted for.
general 2020-10-21 03:55:17 The more defenses we devise, the more weapons they’ll have.
general 2020-10-21 03:55:31 It’s a hopeless stalemate
general 2020-10-21 03:56:13 Oh now we’re getting into the nuanced science of this
general 2020-10-21 03:57:17 IIRC general has been purged before, or something
general 2020-10-21 03:57:20 If that is the case
general 2020-10-21 03:57:27 We’ll never find the infinite gay
general 2020-10-21 03:58:47 I have multiple essays due
general 2020-10-21 03:59:00 I don’t know how many of them I will end up doing
general 2020-10-21 03:59:12 Fuck I hate law
general 2020-10-21 03:59:22 I’m changing subjects next year
general 2020-10-21 03:59:28 Dumbass subject
general 2020-10-21 03:59:31 Fuck
general 2020-10-21 03:59:53 So let’s not speak English
general 2020-10-21 03:59:55 /s
general 2020-10-21 04:00:39 I’m good at English and academic writing isn’t a problem for me. It’s what I’ll have to write about.
general 2020-10-21 04:00:47 Shit
general 2020-10-21 04:01:18 Well
general 2020-10-21 04:02:02 I’m changing to a uni in the UK next year, which was what I was supposed to do this year but funny virus I guess. I should probably take this opportunity to change subjects too.
general 2020-10-21 04:02:27 With my public exam results I could get into a much better uni and study the subject I want
general 2020-10-21 04:03:29 Only if you’re really genuinely passionate about law
general 2020-10-21 04:03:31 I’m not
general 2020-10-21 04:03:40 I tried to study it for the sake of having a shiny CV
general 2020-10-21 04:03:46 But no, it doesn’t work that way
general 2020-10-21 04:04:08 I want to study Politics and International Relations because that’s what I’m passionate about
general 2020-10-21 04:04:19 Thank fuck I still have a second shot at this

general 2020-10-21 04:06:17 Instead of the actual more philosophical/anthropological bit of politics
general 2020-10-21 04:06:28 Yes
general 2020-10-21 04:06:42 Gavrilo Princip didn’t like the lettuce in his sandwich
general 2020-10-21 04:06:46 So he shot the waiter
general 2020-10-21 04:06:53 Who just so happened to be Archduke of Austria
general 2020-10-21 04:07:18 The only reason the Archduke got shot
general 2020-10-21 04:07:26 Was because the driver TOOK A WRONG TURN
general 2020-10-21 04:07:31 into the street where Princip was
general 2020-10-21 04:07:48 That, and the fact that his driver was a nonce
general 2020-10-21 04:07:54 With no sense of direction

creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:50:56 Well here’s my current Reliant Robin (1 block = 0.5m)
creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:52:27 I treat 1 block as half a metre in all my builds, I feel it’s the closest to 1:1 I can get
creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:53:59 That does make a roblox avatar just 1 metre tall, but they look like toddlers anyway
creations-chat 2020-11-11 03:55:45 Welp, I’m kind of forced to build at my half-metre scale because it’s as narrow as my buses can get without ruining the seat layout.
