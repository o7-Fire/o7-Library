plane-crazy 2023-01-09 16:41:08 yeh
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 16:41:24 half cylinder isnt hollow

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 17:49:53 im fixing most of it tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:16:37 lack of copeing skill
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:48:37 Yo mom, i had the same annoying ass issue bout it getting tagged some times and sometimes not
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:48:52 yo mom
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:48:56 so anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:50:33 this is what i discoverd

1.- if it didnt get tagged first then got tagged after that, launch the plane and head back to base

2.- you sometimes have to try adding a letter and modify the text constantly and slowly turn it into what you want to type

3.- spam space and some random letter aswell, sometimes it still gets tagged so you got to delete a few spaces to make it work
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 18:51:12 yeh its a test and error annoying shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:04:45 prob not
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:05:09 prob, and almost definetly not
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:09:19 rickje aint that good
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:09:34 thats a bit too advanced
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:10:15 you can find someway to make them but so far its only for looks
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:23:02 it should, doesnt mean it will
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:43:38 lets hope
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 19:44:02 if im not wrong, he has to turn the game itself into pc2
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 20:46:55 sick

plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:27:37 this exhaust is for a 3x3 cylinder
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:27:46 means each one of that engines will be 3x3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:28:02 means you prob gonna have to fold the plane 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:28:15 whatevs good luck
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:28:30 yea you cant make my mechanism in a 2 blocks wide cylinder 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:28:40 how
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 19:28:55 even if you motor lock them a bit inside they will hit each other i think

plane-crazy 2023-01-13 18:17:56 like, theres one idea i got but its massively complicated, which is locking 2 wings then making a circle with trails

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:50:35 smart
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:54:36 yeh
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:54:39 you dont limit it?
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:54:56 you can limit it placing a block
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:54:59 an anchored block
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:55:01 mid air
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:55:10 so like, when it angles it just stops right there
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:55:44 something like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:56:11 its an anchored block for it to stay in sky, and its an helium block to make it fly away when i lock everything in
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:57:24 if its not perfect instead of that half block you can change it to sometihng else
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:57:34 like a wedge, or a piston with custom height
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:58:03 like, if its just like, 3mm off, you can fix it with the piston
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 15:59:17 move both then <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:14:51 SICK BROOO
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:15:40 nice, i discover a trick for the springs getitng stuck in your builds, even tho that aint your case, you can place an anchor on the spings so they stay mid air after your build loads
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:15:54 i suppouse
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 18:16:01 landing gear has allways been a shit subject

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:50:03 like okay its over used, fucking wing panels are over used
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:50:06 motorolock is overused
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:50:10 everyone does it bc everything has it
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:50:33 All planes have wings, stop using them its overused 😭

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:52:26 YES
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:52:38 just motorlock the half of it
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:52:46 or you can use half cylinder instead of the whole thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:53:01 and add a block under it and lock them
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:53:08 might be easier tbh
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 00:54:45 i think the trapdors will glitch with the ones you already have

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 01:15:45 if you use some easy shapes
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 01:15:55 bc theres some parts you dont need angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 01:16:21 like, half blocks are better but for that you will have to 100% agle lock

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 21:20:45 motorlock and just set the control surfaces on some position so you just hold the key, then press esc, and then the key gets stuck until you press it again so the control panel stays in place and makes that angle

plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:54:58 but hey its the closest to realistic noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:06 i mean, its alot better than square pyramid noses
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:09 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:18 sure
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:18 sure man you re good
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:23 im so proud of you
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:55:36 thats 100% the best nose anyone is capable to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:56:06 how is that innacurate, its a fucking cone 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:56:33 hm
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:56:35 fair enough tbh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:56:54 damn broo
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:57:02 unning out of motors is sick
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:57:22 too much skill
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:57:32 and motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:57:47 if im not wrong, that man wasted all his motors only on the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:58:37 now add landing gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:59:18 really smooth asf
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:59:28 tomcat
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 03:59:50 bro dont post the same thing 5 times in a row, you give dyno anxiety
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:00:08 man gave dyno anxiety 😭
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:00:30 anyway, i actually want to fix the nose, how would you do it mig?
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:01:25 huh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:01:27 wa
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:02:15 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:02:23 ill try cause i will have to add alot of motorlock more
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 04:02:39 since the cone nose makes a hollow cylinder for my landing gear
