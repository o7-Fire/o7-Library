plane-crazy 2019-01-16 14:50:31 do control surfaces work if you put them right behind one another? or do you have to have a wing panel in between them
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 14:52:06 yo can anyone show me how to make a gif?
creations-chat 2019-01-16 14:59:29 So first of all, yes, this is the F-16 most of you may know from youtube, but the only thing I copied is the shape since I'm not really good with the shapes for planes, everything else is changed and modified by me, the back wings have motors that can move them and changes the way the plane flys mid air, it has vertical landing and veritcal takeoff, and a few other things I added. (Don't start saying oh u copied this from youtube cause I literally said it at the beginning)
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:01:06 welp here we start
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:01:40 most people do know it so I mentioned that
creations-chat 2019-01-16 15:27:48 <@427466925275217931> I dont even think you read what I said lmao, I love how you say "slightly", like, the only thing I took from the vid is the shape of the plane, literally everything else about it is different made by me and I added other stuff to, so I guess that's slightly huh?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:21:31 is there such thing as a 1x3 or 1x4 glass triangle wedge?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:22:20 aw
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:23:56 btw there is a glitch where if u cant place blocks or anything next to a 1x4 triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:24:01 and I think its with other things to
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 15:02:09 can i like make a petition to take out friction of the game or idk something like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 15:02:19 it ruins the wheels on all my planes since i make them realistic
creations-chat 2019-01-18 15:28:03 This is my Boeing 747, not the best but I tried, and it the front gear and back gears are all just like irl. (The 2 little blocks on the bottom in the middle are so it it holds the plane up when I launch so the gear can get in place)
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 09:15:53 is there such thing as a 1x2 half wedge down or up glass?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 09:16:11 rip
creations-chat 2019-01-19 09:32:06 My version of the F-22 Raptor, with the back wings that can move to change the way it flies mid air, and vertical takeoff/landing.
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 09:37:59 I'm going to assume that the devs know about the glitch where you chat keybinds to gear or motors etc start right?

plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:34:58 is there any way to stop motors from moving midair?
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:16 yeah but what if its
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:18 one if u need to move
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:23 it
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:26 and then lock it
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:30 cuz i have a f-22 raptor
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:38 and the back wings move to be like the real ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:35:51 but mid air it starts just rotating by itself
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 17:37:00 ok nvm apparently if u have ur landing gear out it moves motors mid air
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 07:42:44 are the devs aware of the glitch where small landing gear just goes and rips apart mid air?
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 07:42:47 if u have them out
