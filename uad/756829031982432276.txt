plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:19 whats going on in here???
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:28 whats with this radar nonsense
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:41:49 how the heck did they "make a radar"
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:24 no block in the game can detect another persons build and you cant make anything detect it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:42:50 didnt think of that
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:43:15 does the human have a gun?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:43:58 unless you give the human infinite prep time 🙂
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:44:22 exactly, i beat the system
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:13 exactly, i'll just use my prep time to go past the cows life span
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:42 i know, we did
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:45:56 we can still chop it down
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:46:30 pull a minecraft and punch it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:47:35 eat the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:47:50 COULD is the key word there
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:03 but theres a reason a burger is so easy to come by
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:24 adapt, overcome the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:39 i'd do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:48:55 can confirm, i had a burger a few days ago
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:32 perfect display of human ingenuity
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:49:48 depends on the arm length
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:50:33 mexican bull fight the cow till it gives up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:51:06 who says i dont?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:10 why does only you get to pick the rules
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:52:48 ah yes, a blanket. totally unfair
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:46 agreed, thats how you beat a cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:54:05 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:54:30 ok but, we did?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:04 human has burger now, we beat cow with adaptation
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:56:28 YOU WANNA BEAT A COW? HERES HOW
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:58:00 run away from the cow meanwhile side stepping it so it cant catch up, grab a loose branch from a tree and a nearby rock. connect the rock with the wood with either fiber or grass then you have yourself a spear. stab the cow and you win
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:58:36 i've won your game
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:08 scroll up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:59 use helium on the side of the ship thats listing
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:00:08 yes i can, i can stab the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:00:20 SCROLL UP
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:00:39 its very long to say but fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:14 run away from the cow and make lots of turns so it cant ram you directly, grab a loose branch and a rock then some grass, tie the rock to the wood to make a makeshift mace (spear if its sharp enough) and kill the cow with it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:47 THATS WHAT IM SAYING
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:22 good point
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:49 better than cows
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:42 nope, you seem to think we have the endurance of a snake i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:23 wrong, once speed is picked up they cant turn on a dime
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:36 not if i side step them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:06:06 a cow is literally a female bull bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:06:55 i dont see you with the role of "cow studier"
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:13 fair point
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:51 i have a feeling thats how its going for them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:08:25 funi
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:09:07 DEPLOY CALF'S
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:31 now hear me out, a 50. Cal might work better than a shovel
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:14 fr a stealth kill
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:45 you cant dig the cows grave with a hammer
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:13:00 digging out intestines is a successful power move
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:13:45 IM GOING TO GET MY GOSH DARN HAMBURGER
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:32 biology isnt fair if you're denying humans their ability to adapt and make tools to kill its foes
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:14 cavemen didnt use guns and they killed a lot of fierce foes much stronger than a cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:37 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:55 you cant make it fair to humans if you deny them the ability to tools
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:10 theres a reason we're the top of the food chain and thats tools
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:38 if you had paid attention to the first 2 times i said it i stated how to make a makeshift spear to stab the cow with
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:17:16 im aware, but humans have poseable thumbs and hands able to climb with
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:17:38 get the materials and climb a tree to make the spear
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:17:50 its just a cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:08 bro i eat those for dinner so much
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:22 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:38 you've established cows are large
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:05 still dont have spears tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:22 a strong human can be beat by a human with a knife
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:38 and?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:57 bro a cow gun, used to kill cows is literally just a metal cylinder
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:20:58 we kill trees in minecraft, we can kill a cow 🙂
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:22:53 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:04 a modern day cow is w e a k
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:20 THATS WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING, HUMANS HAVE TOOLS
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:50 s p e a r
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:24:11 pig can
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:24:23 maybe, but it will work
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:24:46 cows have baby legs that have to carry huge bodies, stab it in the shin
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:06 sneak attack
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:14 thats what im sayin
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:33 thats what i've been saying but they refuse a gun
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:43 WELL WE HAVE IT NOW
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:47 G U N
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:19 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:34 HIT THEM IN THE SHIN WITH A ROCK
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:02 we're giving the cow all it got from thousands of years and vice versa
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:21 ram the cow before it rams us
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:26 we have cars
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:41 BULLS HAVE BIG HORNS TO RAM WITH
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:08 stop saying you give up then continuing
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:35 ALL IM SAYIN IS
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:43 THERES A REASON BURGERS ARE COMMON
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:29:26 this scenario has been played out countless times, theres a reason cows are farm animals now
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:30:28 they dont birth em like they used to
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:21 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:31:54 they led their species proud with leather fists
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:32:41 which ape we talkin, cause i doubt gorilla
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:32:53 at once?
general 2023-01-03 05:33:55 how the heg did you get the canopy so smooth
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:34:27 dang jerry, i guess you only allow tom to live dont you?

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:47:38 one of lifes greatest mystery's
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:53:04 why arent you already
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:53:13 what have you been doing
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:53:30 you cant make anyone control your creation
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:53:34 only you
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:55:12 um
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:55:17 for you to use other seats
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:55:59 like for instance on my carriers i have a seat for the ship itself and seat on the aircraft onboard to control from both spots
creations-chat 2023-01-03 20:22:36 i know, this is an old pic i fixed it later
creations-chat 2023-01-03 20:24:39 tysm, heres the better hull
general 2023-01-05 11:16:03 correct, dark magic is no laughing matter
general 2023-01-05 11:16:08 but it is what they use
creations-chat 2023-01-06 08:24:35 give it a top hat
creations-chat 2023-01-06 13:22:25 could anyone help me with making the treads less thicc?
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 09:01:45 flashback to when someone thought cows were better than humans
creations-chat 2023-01-07 09:04:08 accurate
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:40:37 its funi
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:42:39 whats so wrong about it anyways, why does it offend you in such a way you need to downvote it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 09:45:01 explain how, i need feedback if you want it to improve
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:33:34 its a mini build bruh, what do you mean low effort
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:38:48 fair point, but i also dont see how this is feedback, this is more just insults
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:47:36 W
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:58:40 im not very familiar with the X02S but from what i see they might need to be a little closer together depending on how big you want it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 11:00:45 i see, well i'd say make the landing gear and then from there you can tell how far apart they should be by lookin at a reference image but other than that looks good👍
creations-chat 2023-01-08 11:15:43 right
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:25:11 <@817489867017551883> i'd say work on the wings of the F-14 so they dont look they're hanging on by a thread, also i didnt delete it it said i was swearing for some reason
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:29:27 one way to fix that issue is by making the wing more straight like this  top image for example then putting an indent on the side of the fuselage so your wing can still fold like so
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:38:59 i would post mine but i feel like it would get bullied
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:41:18 o k

creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:47:27 F-35B then? it might be fun making the VTOL
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:52:14 YOU CALL THAT BASIC??????
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:54:16 bruh everyone on this server is to talented with this stuff, the best i can do on my mini builds is a half wedge in front of the seat and thats my cockpit instruments
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:30:02 or hold the key then type in chat
general 2023-01-10 07:57:55 how viable would it be to use a weather balloon to carry a brick up to the edge of space and drop it on someone
general 2023-01-10 07:57:59 asking for a friend
general 2023-01-10 07:58:26 good to know
general 2023-01-10 07:59:05 good- i mean uh good for my friend
general 2023-01-10 07:59:37 nah nah i was asking for a friend, they'll like this information im sure
general 2023-01-10 08:01:41 intresting
general 2023-01-10 08:02:28 now asking for a friend again theoretically can you carry someone up to the edge of space with weather balloons and survive if they brought oxygen and a parachute
general 2023-01-10 08:03:49 but can it be done with 3 very big balloons
general 2023-01-10 08:05:04 gosh darn it people need to go ballooning
general 2023-01-10 08:06:36 someone named walter flew with 42 normal balloons whats to say i cant do it with 3 weather balloons
general 2023-01-10 08:11:01 bros using light mode
general 2023-01-10 08:11:10 death penalty
creations-chat 2023-01-11 11:07:19 me too, i can see effort in the build but it just dosent look like an F-16
general 2023-01-11 11:09:34 now i know the weather balloon taking me to the edge of space was a far fetched idea but what if instead i use those small jet engines you can buy and put a bunch of them on a lawn chair
general 2023-01-11 11:09:54 hyopthetically could that work with some stabalization of some kind
general 2023-01-11 11:10:20 how far'd they make it?
general 2023-01-11 11:10:26 well heck
general 2023-01-11 11:10:34 back to weather balloons then
general 2023-01-11 11:11:26 now
general 2023-01-11 11:11:28 idea
general 2023-01-11 11:11:39 the jet engine suits the navy has been using
general 2023-01-11 11:11:49 the iron man like things
general 2023-01-11 11:12:00 could they take me to the edge of space
general 2023-01-11 11:12:09 and what is their service ceiling
general 2023-01-11 11:13:30 its weird that you mention that but i have seen good female builders FYI
general 2023-01-11 11:14:02 yeah i have seen like 5 and im friends with 2 of them
general 2023-01-11 11:14:34 1 of them made really good bowling alleys with working pin reseting andd ball return
general 2023-01-11 11:14:47 ikr, plane crazy kids wildin
general 2023-01-11 11:16:18 anyways back to getting myself to the edge of space
general 2023-01-11 11:16:32 can a parachute stop your fall if you fell from the edge of space?
general 2023-01-11 11:16:46 what about
general 2023-01-11 11:16:47 2
general 2023-01-11 11:16:49 parachutes
general 2023-01-11 11:17:37 have you ever seen a nerd fly in a lawn chair with balloons?
general 2023-01-11 11:17:40 didnt think so
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:16:58 jets are overmade, make a car bomb
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:19:05 make the wings and intakes of the F-14 and make those fly, not the rest of it just the wings and intake
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:44:55 never thought of it like that
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:47:43 WHAT IF IM JUST HOLDING SHIFT YOU DONT KNOW
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:44:23 pretty sick
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:46:51 how dare you do that to the church crocc
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:49:59 you can see it dosent use M2M so its basically just a mini SU-27M
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:52:03 reason #1 you should ask to be the one to hold the starting revolver ^
creations-chat 2023-02-02 09:54:15 bro it took me a minute to figure out he was blocking his jet and that wasnt just the build itself
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:01:19 if you want tips of how to level up enough to get image perms do what i did, get in an arguement on if a human or a cow would win 1 to 1 for an hour
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:03:26 if you were wondering the majority vote was sidestep the cow till it runs out of stamina
creations-chat 2023-02-02 10:28:11 this is a public channel
creations-chat 2023-02-02 12:45:49 this sentence does not make you look like the good guy, it makes you look stuck up

creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:43:06 why must you downvote instead of upvote
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:48:11 understandable
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:59:36 sorry no offense but the gear is way to small for a jet that big
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:02:15 all im saying is he was saying the gear is bad
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:04:55 1: i dont really wanna answer the question anymore since you're yelling at me for no reason. 2: if you really want advice then here ya go, make it more straight like the blueprint
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:06:58 and yet you attack me for answering your question cause everyone else is acting mean to you, i see how it is
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:09:00 it was your question actually, i get what you mean though this server has some really awful guys
creations-chat 2023-02-02 14:12:29 idk man, maybe they just need someone to pick on to feel good about their lives, you know the classic bully. guess thats why they call it cyber bullying
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:04:55 im lookin for advice on how to make it better if you were willing to do that
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:10:08 Well personally I like mini builds more than big builds.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:18:26 does a feature to make its ammunition explode count as detail?
creations-chat 2023-02-03 08:03:57 <@682147422218223616> i have several questions. 1: why did you post a screenshot from a youtube video. 2: is that even your video
creations-chat 2023-02-03 09:03:13 still dosent answer the 1st question though
general 2023-02-03 09:21:43 true
general 2023-02-03 09:21:58 ello
general 2023-02-03 09:39:19 i mean i dont know about boring
general 2023-02-03 09:39:35 the idea of a submarine aircraft carrier is pretty intresting
general 2023-02-03 09:40:06 exactly
general 2023-02-03 09:41:06 just imagine the gerald R ford sending its full carrier wing of around 75 aircraft then sinking into the depths and escaping
general 2023-02-03 09:41:17 definitely not boring
general 2023-02-03 09:41:40 yes

creations-chat 2023-02-03 12:02:30 No I'm saying I don't have a white name anymore, my name is not white.

general 2023-02-04 14:55:22 but the grip isnt angled enough
general 2023-02-04 14:55:51 that gun has a standard pistol grip by the looks of it
general 2023-02-04 14:56:34 well yes but the grip is still angled like the luger
general 2023-02-04 14:57:19 actually yeah
general 2023-02-04 14:57:22 that could be it

plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:57:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:58:41 i'd say modifying takes less time than starting from scratch so its really depending on how little work you wanna do
general 2023-02-05 03:21:03 dont give me hope
general 2023-02-05 03:24:34 when i joined they were streaming a tank game, world of tanks im pretty sure

creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:35:52 lemme guess, lava spitter?
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:46:01 it all just seems insensitive to build the wtc in a game about planes (cause you know what 50 percent of the player base is gonna do)
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:52:23 i see no problems with it other than the fact its an E variant <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:54:28 Nothin much I just think the F variant's cockpit looks a lot better.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:56:32 and yet EA made battlefront 2. I cant decide whether to hate or like them<:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-02-07 07:59:24 the cockpit is just so small on the E variant
creations-chat 2023-02-07 08:02:15 Its your preference really, keep it the E variant if you want I just personally think the F variant looks better.
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 08:03:03 am i really that wrong for saying we should strap AIM-120's to the E-2 Hawkeye

general 2023-02-07 15:09:46 F-16's can carry AIM-120's for the easy win
general 2023-02-07 15:10:39 sea
general 2023-02-07 15:11:19 dogfights wont happen, the F-16 will just spot the SU-57 and pop em like a chinese weather balloon, easy

general 2023-02-13 16:23:25 didnt it get burned to the ground
general 2023-02-13 16:23:48 man this lore is as confusing as ever
general 2023-02-13 16:24:13 pretty sure houses dont stand up after burning though
general 2023-02-13 16:24:36 alright
general 2023-02-13 16:25:25 pretty sure the fire would leave them as skeletons
general 2023-02-13 16:26:22 blood would evaporate but it might leave a stain
general 2023-02-13 16:26:31 or idk if blood evaporates
general 2023-02-13 16:26:35 eh
general 2023-02-13 16:26:53 according to the internet blood evaporates
general 2023-02-13 16:27:39 and the fire would intensify the evaporation
general 2023-02-13 16:28:14 i dont heggin know the lore anymore
general 2023-02-13 16:28:44 at the end of fnaf 1 you see burned animatronic heads
general 2023-02-13 16:28:53 but i dont heckin know
general 2023-02-13 16:29:39 at this point i have 0 faith even scott knows the lore
general 2023-02-13 16:30:23 but thats just a theory
general 2023-02-13 16:30:28 a gay theory
general 2023-02-13 16:31:52 not at all
general 2023-02-13 16:32:33 serious doubt
general 2023-02-13 16:32:36 its just a robot
general 2023-02-13 16:33:08 according to the lOrE hes actually only alive cause candice or what ever the heck her name is keeps him alive
general 2023-02-13 16:33:24 he should really just die
general 2023-02-13 16:33:40 its like an avengers movie in the fnaf lore at this point
general 2023-02-13 16:33:48 yeah
general 2023-02-13 16:34:10 golden freddy
general 2023-02-13 16:34:30 yes
general 2023-02-13 16:35:07 golden freddy is an animatronic
general 2023-02-13 16:35:14 fredbear is a springy boi
general 2023-02-13 16:35:30 lie
general 2023-02-13 16:35:31 s
general 2023-02-13 16:35:46 just cause he can dissapear dosent mean hes a ghost
general 2023-02-13 16:35:54 bonnie appears and dissapears randomly too
general 2023-02-13 16:36:03 they all teleport
general 2023-02-13 16:37:54 anyways
general 2023-02-13 16:37:58 tell me albert
general 2023-02-13 16:38:03 if golden freddy is a ghost
general 2023-02-13 16:38:26 how does the ghosts of cassidy and unamed kid possess the bear
general 2023-02-13 16:38:31 a ghost cant possess a ghost
general 2023-02-13 16:38:48 no
general 2023-02-13 16:39:09 one is an animatronic the other is an animatrionic with springlocks
general 2023-02-13 16:40:53 also depending on what lOrE you wanna believe fredbear is possessed by a janitor and golden freddy is possessed by 2 kids
general 2023-02-13 16:41:31 as i said
general 2023-02-13 16:41:49 depending on what lore you wanna believe
general 2023-02-13 16:42:06 cause in fnaf 4 a guy gets springlocked in the fredbear suit and becomes shadow freddy
general 2023-02-13 16:42:16 he dosent have a name
general 2023-02-13 16:42:25 though the fandom gave him the name evan
general 2023-02-13 16:42:42 different janitor
general 2023-02-13 16:43:23 so fredbear isnt technically possessed but it did springlock someone and turn them into shadow freddy
general 2023-02-13 16:43:26 idk
general 2023-02-13 16:43:31 this lore drives people insane
general 2023-02-13 16:44:23 87 is mangle biting the frontal lobe of either a security guard or a janitor i forgot
general 2023-02-13 16:44:40 83 is the crying child gettin bit in the frontal lobe
general 2023-02-13 16:44:57 87 is fnaf 2 83 is crying child
general 2023-02-13 16:45:30 or does it
general 2023-02-13 16:45:50 we still cant even decide whether the games are a dream or not
general 2023-02-13 16:46:14 yes
general 2023-02-13 16:46:45 the animatronics in fnaf 4 are what the child thinks when he sees the normal ones
general 2023-02-13 16:47:22 and the entirety of fnaf 4 is the crying child in a coma in a hospital
general 2023-02-13 16:47:34 i hate remnant
general 2023-02-13 16:47:39 such a stupid thing to add
general 2023-02-13 16:47:58 mAgIc SoUl DuSt
general 2023-02-13 16:48:25 its said if the nightmares got to him he would have a heart attack
general 2023-02-13 16:48:58 or
general 2023-02-13 16:49:02 heres a thought
general 2023-02-13 16:49:03 no
general 2023-02-13 16:49:53 the cameras show his room cause william was monitoring him, just like how his plush talks to him its william talking to him like the comics show
general 2023-02-13 16:50:36 the comic of the soilder talking to his kid in a hospital while deployed by talking through the kids bear
general 2023-02-13 16:51:05 i dont know at this point

general 2023-02-13 17:14:24 and i mean all you do in fnaf is close doors
general 2023-02-13 17:14:31 and look at animals on a tablet

creations-chat 2023-05-31 08:13:48 work out at the gym once every day, if you do that consistently your muscles will be able to work better and faster, thus allowing you to be more manuverable
creations-chat 2023-05-31 08:19:21 Important tip I forgot to mention, do NOT overdue your time at the gym if your goal is maneuverability. If you are to overdue it your ripped frame will no longer be agile, it will be big and chunky in a ripped fashion (also don't miss leg day) hope that helped
