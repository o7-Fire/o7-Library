general 2022-06-19 22:59:29 yep
general 2022-06-19 22:59:40 jesus
general 2022-06-19 22:59:58 BLOCK THE ACCOUNTS THAT INVITE YOU AND REPORT THEM TO DISCORD
general 2022-09-07 16:23:58 <@750546758542688367> how do you use hacks to put parts wherever you want?
general 2022-09-07 16:24:27 you cant do that much detail on your Maersk container truck without overlapping parts
general 2022-09-07 16:24:45 damn thats crazy
general 2022-09-07 16:25:04 I wonder if he can show what his build looks like before he does the assembly at the end
general 2022-09-07 16:25:29 so you basically use a crapton of motors and swing everything into place?
general 2022-09-07 16:25:36 alr
general 2022-09-07 16:25:42 yeah ik
general 2022-09-07 16:26:46 people in <#384025409945337856> should be required to show what their build looks like before everything is swung into place haha
general 2022-09-07 16:27:04 DANG
general 2022-09-07 16:27:44 like you know how people assemble their builds that are too big for the plot by using motors
general 2022-09-07 16:28:02 you build it folded
general 2022-09-07 16:29:33 no like I believe that their builds are real
general 2022-09-07 16:29:36 thats not what im saying
general 2022-09-07 16:29:52 I'm just curious how some people engineer their folding together of the creation
general 2022-09-07 16:29:55 it's amazing
general 2022-09-07 16:30:24 it's very hard to connect two separate creations in a server though
general 2022-09-07 16:30:30 magnets dont work across creations
general 2022-09-07 16:31:13 okay chill tf out
general 2022-09-07 16:31:32 stop
general 2022-09-07 16:31:51 yeah true
general 2022-09-07 16:31:57 so more of a model than functional
general 2022-09-07 16:32:37 the most impressive builds are the ones that are equally as functional as they are detailed hehe
general 2022-09-07 16:32:57 ^
general 2022-09-07 16:33:02 I'm a veteran here
general 2022-09-07 16:33:04 an old timer
general 2022-09-07 16:33:21 yes
general 2022-09-07 16:33:38 but you've been consistently here, I come and go
general 2022-09-07 16:33:43 lol
general 2022-09-07 16:34:43 I'm so busy making my own games on roblox, I wish I had more time to make stuff in PC
general 2022-09-07 16:35:23 I bought my Model 3 just over a year ago with money I made from roblox tho âœ¨
general 2022-09-07 16:36:32 nice
bot-central 2022-11-01 18:14:39 !rank
creations-chat 2022-11-01 18:44:20 aye yeah idk why I cant post pics on here
creations-chat 2022-11-01 19:18:08 yeah
creations-chat 2022-11-03 19:25:28 <@699460165707235338> can you show me what that looked like before motorlock?
creations-chat 2022-12-08 19:11:44 I find it funny when someone goes through all the effort to make a motor locked creation and it still looks crappy
creations-chat 2022-12-08 20:22:31 I was an elite builder until my discord got nuked a year ago and nobody returned my old roles
