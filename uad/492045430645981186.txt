plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:22:37 rickje literally threatened a dude with a "lawsuit"
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:22:41 like
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:22:46 one of his devs that branched off
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:23:00 I can only assume the dev team is not actually on board with him
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:23:44 domino effect maybe
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:24:09 I just think the integrity of pc2 is
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:24:14 crumbling
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:24:46 ok how do I re-verify
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 16:25:01 like, I have my main account unlocked so I can actually link it correctly lol

general 2022-03-20 23:53:40 why would anyone be annoyed to someone clicking the reactions
general 2022-03-20 23:54:20 ok bro
general 2022-03-20 23:54:57 don’t worry, I asked
general 2022-03-20 23:55:47 I just wanna be updated on any progress (none)
general 2022-03-20 23:56:36 rick’s dev team probably crumbling
general 2022-03-20 23:56:52 taking an awful long while to get a recode out there
general 2022-03-20 23:57:18 remember when rick said it was nearing 75% completion
general 2022-03-20 23:57:30 probably fake, false hope
general 2022-03-20 23:59:39 ok mom
general 2022-03-21 00:00:28 I literally doubted it’s credibility but ok
general 2022-03-21 00:00:35 rickje almighty
general 2022-03-21 00:00:52 same bro
general 2022-03-21 00:01:22 that’s insane
general 2022-03-21 00:05:53 water
general 2022-03-21 00:08:56 easy way to avoid harsh criticism from PCC is to just not post lol
general 2022-03-21 00:09:56 community weird anyways, downvote bombs a decent build but praises a jokester with a less than decent build
general 2022-03-21 00:12:02 makes them even worse than the newer rockets
general 2022-03-21 00:12:42 they are
general 2022-03-21 00:12:44 slow
general 2022-03-21 00:13:17 not when they are locking, they literally buffer
general 2022-03-21 00:25:52 ok cool
general 2022-03-21 00:34:57 I eat ducks
general 2022-03-21 00:40:49 fr though, they are a delicacy to me
general 2022-03-21 01:20:52 Ironic, the man who’d probably speak about that lol

creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:51:06 and that’s why you don’t post in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:52:48 I can neither confirm nor deny
creations-chat 2022-05-23 00:55:02 I probably post su-35 here sooner or later
general 2022-05-23 01:18:09 I’ve never actively chatted here cause of people like this guy

creations-chat 2022-05-24 00:31:07 is su-35
creations-chat 2022-05-24 00:33:43 I can't tell if it's the angle, but the top of the nose looks flat

plane-crazy 2022-07-10 15:22:54 yo, do you guys think I'd be able to message a mod for someone using lag machines or is getting a ticket the only way
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 14:33:24 rickje 4 months later has figured out how to script flowing lava
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 14:33:28 this is amazing
creations-chat 2022-08-18 20:18:03 color kinda inconsistent don’t you think
general 2022-09-08 23:26:50 a jack of all trades but a master of none, there’s nothing the f-35 excels in
general 2022-09-08 23:27:47 american ka-52
general 2022-09-08 23:29:31 the f-22 has the same stealth capability, better engines, and better fighter performance
general 2022-09-08 23:29:51 it’s almost like it was dedicated for a certain role and wasn’t equally shit in everything it did!
general 2022-09-08 23:30:15 multi role jets won’t work
general 2022-09-08 23:31:27 russians producing a new tank/aircraft every 2 years to keep up with their western counterpart made years ago
general 2022-09-08 23:33:58 110 million USD per unit
general 2022-09-08 23:34:46 no?
general 2022-09-08 23:35:28 I take it that you made up those numbers yourself because the f-35A is 110 million per unit
general 2022-09-08 23:36:24 russians sitting on pie shaped bombs for autoloaders
general 2022-09-08 23:37:55 for 10 million extra, you can have a proven fighter that excels at one thing instead of doing everything equally shitty 😀
general 2022-09-08 23:38:31 f-22
general 2022-09-08 23:39:42 I’d argue the f-22 still does better performance wise, 2d thrust vectoring, higher service ceiling, and faster
general 2022-09-08 23:40:24 multi-role fighters just do everything bad EQUALLY
general 2022-09-08 23:41:32 if you think about it, the t-72 turret is just one big blowout panel for the driver
general 2022-09-08 23:42:16 how to throw your yearly paycheck at the enemy and win
general 2022-09-08 23:42:57 or converted???
general 2022-09-08 23:44:19 f-18 is just ass at everything except recon and close air support
general 2022-09-08 23:44:56 if you call the f-18 a fighter or an interceptor, you’re dead wrong
general 2022-09-08 23:45:37 fucked up designations lol
general 2022-09-08 23:46:23 I don’t see it doing very well with a G limit of 7.5
general 2022-09-08 23:46:42 wrong, mach 5
general 2022-09-08 23:47:00 the a-10 is the most capable jet ever
general 2022-09-08 23:48:06 a-10 engines are so strogn yuo can go strait uop
general 2022-09-08 23:49:28 possible a-10 modifications: 105mm royal ordinance L7, VTOL control of the engines
general 2022-09-08 23:51:26 how much are you guys willing to bet the t-14 armata’s turret is going to fail after a small amount of wear and tear<:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-09-08 23:52:23 it would be so funny if russia could just create a normal tank
general 2022-09-08 23:52:35 🤣👉
creations-chat 2022-09-16 10:07:37 it is TALL
creations-chat 2022-09-27 19:35:08 the expectation is to make something that isn’t disproportionate

general 2023-03-17 07:20:08 south america?
general 2023-03-17 07:20:16 I figured
general 2023-03-17 07:20:22 03:20 here
general 2023-03-17 07:20:45 AM?
general 2023-03-17 07:21:42 britain maybe
general 2023-03-17 07:21:57 epic fail
general 2023-03-17 07:22:08 gonna guess here
general 2023-03-17 07:22:17 the arctic
general 2023-03-17 07:22:52 man, geography is so funky
general 2023-03-17 07:23:08 I’m american so I have a natural debuff for that
general 2023-03-17 07:24:16 man, geography and history are probabaly the easiest things ever
general 2023-03-17 07:24:21 doesn’t change usually
general 2023-03-17 07:24:49 china has 2 million active personnel <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-03-17 07:25:26 china during a land invasion can be quickly defeated from a north east attack as its just rural areas <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-03-17 07:26:29 man, I think a reality check for the whole world would be lit
general 2023-03-17 07:26:40 our testosterone levels are like
general 2023-03-17 07:26:51 abysmal compared to someone from the 1950s
general 2023-03-17 07:27:01 and nutrition value from foods
general 2023-03-17 07:27:55 ys sure
general 2023-03-17 07:29:38 an apple nowadays is 1/5 as nutritional as an apple from the 70s
general 2023-03-17 07:30:02 not at all
general 2023-03-17 07:30:21 crop regulations were relaxed and now they have less nutrition
general 2023-03-17 07:30:36 since the mass production of foods
general 2023-03-17 07:31:14 “A 2004 US study found important nutrients in some garden crops are up to 38% lower than there were at the middle of the 20th Century.”
general 2023-03-17 07:31:20 pesticides, preservatives
general 2023-03-17 07:31:29 they lower nutritional value
general 2023-03-17 07:32:43 man what does
general 2023-03-17 07:32:45 ic mean
general 2023-03-17 07:33:19 I guess
general 2023-03-17 07:33:31 doesn’t help though, since junk food is cheaper
general 2023-03-17 07:33:51 you can serve a family of 5 for 30 bucks just by going to mcdonald’s
general 2023-03-17 07:34:06 instead of a more expensive gourmet dinner
general 2023-03-17 07:34:20 still cheaper than clean eating
general 2023-03-17 07:34:25 which is shocking to me
general 2023-03-17 07:35:14 chicken sandwiches bro
general 2023-03-17 07:35:32 like, GOOD chicken sandwiches
general 2023-03-17 07:35:50 somehow america ain’t even number 1 in child obesity
general 2023-03-17 07:36:00 1/7 kids in america are obese
general 2023-03-17 07:36:04 1/5 in britain
general 2023-03-17 07:36:35 ain’t as bad as it used to be
general 2023-03-17 07:36:57 it is most definitely harder to eat healthy
general 2023-03-17 07:37:07 it’s almost criminal
general 2023-03-17 07:37:52 you see dudes in southern states here in america with their ford 4x4s weighing almost as much as their trucks
general 2023-03-17 07:37:59 aauuuu
general 2023-03-17 07:38:06 the dudes themselves

plane-crazy 2023-05-19 00:20:31 pretty simple but it works for almost ro-scale builds
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 00:20:51 
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 00:21:26 tbh, don't know what to do with the chassis though
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 00:26:43 normalizes the little angles too, so that's pretty fancy

general 2023-06-09 09:15:59 but it sucks in optimizing
general 2023-06-09 09:16:35 ghpc is probably the best tank game in the market rn though
