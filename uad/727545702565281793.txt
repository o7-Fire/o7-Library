general 2021-03-21 12:54:48 Transfur outbreak is a roblox game where you can either be a furry, or a furry hunter
general 2021-03-21 12:55:08 And there's the rem 870 in TO
general 2021-03-21 12:55:38 Not rlly, because anyone can be a furry at anytime
help 2021-03-23 17:50:03 I am trying to make a giant vtol able to lift other players' vehicles. The problem is that, right here, this big boi has literally 40 giant jet engine and still cannot even lift himself in the sky...does anyone know how to fix this problem?
help 2021-03-23 17:57:54 Only 12 super rockets were needed to lift my thing
help 2021-03-23 17:57:58 I want to swear

plane-crazy 2021-03-25 05:40:43 Hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 05:41:02 Did anyone got a pic of the largest shredder bug they've ever seen?
general 2021-03-25 05:41:54 Anyone got a pic of a large shredder bug?
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:50:35 Bc there are only interceptor bugs tutorial on youtube
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:50:57 I am looking for bigger one, such as dragon bugs, worm bugs or grapple bugs
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:52:14 I am trying to build something that will make me get a lot of hate
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:52:31 *a SB land carrier*
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:52:44 No
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:52:50 A shredder bug carrier
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:53:03 But a land carrier, not a water one
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:54:11 Missile bugs is already a subspecie of shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:54:26 Those are like them but with lots of tnt instead of cutters
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:54:41 Tank fish made one once
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:54:59 Hey
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:55:07 I am not looking to troll players
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:55:12 I want real fight
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:55:18 This is why im doing cutter only
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:56:07 I am just trying to see how small a shredder bug can be
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:56:16 For my carrier
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:56:38 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:56:53 Did you got screenshot of any big SB?
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:57:01 Aw
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:57:27 Imagine a shredder bug with a cutter cannon
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:57:46 I tried to make a cutter shotgun turret once
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:58:16 Pretty well, but the shell ejection wasn't perfect
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:58:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:59:02 *Me too*
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:59:26 Also something horrible are shredder bug swarms
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 11:59:55 Since they are simple to build, they can be built multiple times on the same spot
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:00:27 This is not better than a robot army tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:00:51 Y e s
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:00:57 With guns and rockets on them
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:02:03 I like those builds but i'm trying to add something original tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:02:16 Like the shredder bug carrier i've mentionned before
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:03:22 I'm trying to make some sort of giant shredder-bug-looking bomber for the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:04:41 Also i like shredder bugs because it's one of the rare builds where the cutters are actually good to use
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:07:52 Give me a type of build with efficient cutters then
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:08:40 I said i am trying to make a carrier of it
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:08:55 And also i prefer the big shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:09:09 Like dragonbugs worm bugs or grapple bugs
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:09:58 But are harder to make, you need a minimum of skill to build a giant one
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:11:01 What type?
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:11:45 Also i already said i am doing cutter only
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:12:01 The cutter is the only weapon i use on them
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:12:10 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:12:34 I love it
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:13:19 Hey
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:13:38 Atleast i accept defeat when someone has a good and original ASB weapon
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:13:56 Like rear guns
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:14:15 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:14:33 I am still trying to learn more about their mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:15:04 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:16:02 Wait you drew your pfp yourself?
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:16:15 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:16:16 Me too
plane-crazy 2021-03-25 12:16:49 <@820381314342977566> hey can u post the full pfp in <#497142796961054721> pls?

general 2021-03-25 12:18:00 Deploy the anti jet guns
general 2021-03-25 12:18:11 To protect the SBs
general 2021-03-25 12:18:21 Yup
general 2021-03-25 12:18:34 A snake one
general 2021-03-25 12:18:48 That's called a scaly
general 2021-03-25 12:19:16 The reptile equivalent to furries are scalies
general 2021-03-25 12:19:38 Hey i am getting on my limits
general 2021-03-25 12:20:15 You can hate me for having a positive opinion on SBs but not for being a scaly
general 2021-03-25 12:21:51 Can't
general 2021-03-25 12:25:15 <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
general 2021-03-25 12:26:43 Why is there no rank for trains?
general 2021-03-25 17:15:32 You're a furry too?
general 2021-03-25 17:16:13 Noice

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 16:07:05 Where?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 16:07:23 Where was the original creation?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 16:07:29 Wich video?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 16:10:00 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 16:11:08 Btw i'm a turret main and i'm trying to make an ASB turret (Anti Shredder Bug). The thing is that i have no idea of what makes a weapon a good ASB
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 18:58:44 Did anyone got a mine laying vehicle?
general 2021-04-10 18:59:16 Guys
general 2021-04-10 18:59:33 I can make peoples angry in only 4 words
general 2021-04-10 18:59:40 GLORY TO SHREDDER BUGS
general 2021-04-10 18:59:56 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-04-10 19:00:31 Told ya <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-04-10 19:00:53 Yeah
general 2021-04-10 19:01:15 An update i would love to see would be a grabbable block
general 2021-04-10 19:01:59 Wbo's pfp?
general 2021-04-10 19:04:02 That's what happened for the PVP game "lua virus". There was a popular room where a lot of players came to roleplay, but the dev didn't liked the fact that there was peoples who didn't liked to fight, so he straight up removed the room. Now the game got even more toxic and even more died
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:16:38 No, sorry
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:16:52 Btw i have a question
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:17:17 I want to make a PvP mobile hive mind structure
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:17:39 What is the smallest remote-control PvP vehicle possible to build?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:18:16 You mean shredder bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:18:58 It was a question
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:19:29 If it's not a shredder bug i can't see what it should look like
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:19:42 Can i have a pic pls?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:20:16 No, i don't want kamikaze minions
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:20:36 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:20:42 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:20:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:21:25 How many blocks long is it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:21:48 Perfect
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:22:27 Should i make an aquatic, a flying, a rolling or a railway hive?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:22:35 For those tiny planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:22:38 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:23:03 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:23:32 The flying vehicles are hard to build but maybe if i make some sort of zeppelin-like hive mind it can be easier
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:24:37 Me too
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:24:45 Autosave is uber satisfying
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:25:50 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:25:58 Carriers are hard to build
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:26:04 But are fun to use
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:26:13 Especially if they have working planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:44:15 Yeah i tried this plane out and realized that it turns very slowly
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:44:33 Not very good for a swarm attack
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:44:45 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:48:04 It doesn't need to be flying tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 09:48:30 All i ask is just a very tiny vehicle that is good for swarming in PvP
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:03:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:03:22 I think
general 2021-06-21 07:42:15 Where is the meme section
general 2021-06-23 20:54:10 Are memes allowed in <#497142796961054721>?
general 2021-06-23 20:54:19 Ok
general 2021-06-23 20:54:26 Oh

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 20:44:52 I have a pun
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 20:45:13 Since i'm usually a mobile player, but prefer playing plane crazy on computer...
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 20:45:27 *I don't play P.C without my PC*
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 20:48:52 Lol
general 2021-08-03 17:37:19 Discord blox fact: If you think that the rules in your fav roblox servers are too strict, join mugen's discord and you'll see actual annoying restrictions
general 2021-08-03 17:37:46 Mugen is a roblox game
general 2021-08-03 17:37:57 And the name of the owner of the server related to the game
general 2021-08-03 17:38:09 A game trying to have a cameo on every roblox games
general 2021-08-03 17:38:21 It's a roblox myth
general 2021-08-03 17:39:29 I mean among official roblox games' servers
general 2021-08-03 17:39:38 Hold on
general 2021-08-03 17:39:47 Lemme grab some screenshots of the server
general 2021-08-03 17:40:54 
general 2021-08-03 17:41:17 This is literally the only server I've been in giving an instant ban to whatever mistake you do
general 2021-08-03 17:41:23 Even swearing is bannable
general 2021-08-03 17:41:28 Like
general 2021-08-03 17:41:31 What the heck
general 2021-08-03 17:42:22 What's pcc?
general 2021-08-03 17:42:45 Oh ok
general 2021-08-03 17:43:33 The rules of mugen are way too fucking strict
general 2021-08-03 17:43:37 Like cmon dude
general 2021-08-03 17:43:44 Banning for swearing???
general 2021-08-03 17:43:54 Oh sorry
general 2021-08-03 17:44:07 Oh
general 2021-08-03 17:44:12 Ok lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:40:19 I made a big shredder bug that can turn into a smaller one lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:40:44 Don't worry
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:40:48 I'm not a troll
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:41:21 The big one is made for self defense while the small one is made to escape
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:41:32 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:41:53 I'll show some pics
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:43:49 Normal size
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:45:23 And here is the mini shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:45:55 All you can send to oblivion is the main armament
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:46:05 The mini shredder is super fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:46:19 Even though not good at fights
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:46:32 But the big one is super slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:47:09 Catch me first
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:47:14 😎
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:47:51 Lemme check my speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:48:34 Around 290 for normal size (ik it's slow for a SA)
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:48:57 And 580 for mini shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:49:54 Heyo why are you hating shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:50:03 I'm not a troll
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:52:41 Did someone ever got a score for a shredder bug?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:53:30 That's only your opinion
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:54:27 Did someone ever made a shredder that doesn't get hated?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:55:19 Not if they're slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:55:34 Look, the top speed of my full shredder is 290
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:55:49 It's not annoying to deal with
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:56:30 They're not with all of the engineered AST weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:57:03 Yes, ironically it was when I was trying my new shredder model for the first time
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:57:13 It was a loooong sword filled with TNT
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:57:30 That's also why I gave mine an escape system
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:58:49 I hope to be able to create more models soon
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:59:34 What about a score for fight efficiency?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 16:59:37 😎

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:01:40 Where is he
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:01:58 Oh heck
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:02:15 Hey shredders aren't against the rules
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:02:42 Jokes on you I'm christian
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:02:59 Christians technically can't go to hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:03:03 😎
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:03:41 I've never said that I'm good at PvP
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:04:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:13:45 What is worst? Lag machines or shredder bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 17:15:31 Personaly I think it's lag machines for 3 major facts:
1 - they can target everyone at the same time
2 - they can heavily ruin the experience of other players
3 - they can be activated at any moment, even in the regular gamemode
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:14:41 Very noice
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:14:56 Talkin' about flying vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:15:42 Does anyone have any tips on how to make HSBs (AKA Heavy Shredder Bug)?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:38:11 Not funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:39:50 I've realized that to stabilize a shredder bug you just need to place wings until it stops shaking
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:40:10 But it's also their weak point
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:40:25 Shoot their tail and they'll start spinning before crashing
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:42:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:42:46 I thought you were trying to make me build a broken shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:43:34 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:44:10 I've seen that heli blades also work to stabilize the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:44:15 Like
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:44:30 My heaviest shredder has 6 heli blades on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:44:36 4 on the sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:44:41 And 2 on the center
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 18:53:58 Hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 18:54:23 What's something you would love to see in PC2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 18:55:00 I would love to see a custom weight for the missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 18:55:16 So that you can make weapons that shoot in arcs
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:19:20 Yeah but it's not unlimited
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:19:44 I hate to constantly have to reset and relaunch my arty just to reload it
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:20:28 If I do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:20:37 Then I switch to shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:21:40 Well
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:21:50 Why shouldn't I use arty?
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:22:27 That's not a solution
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:23:01 What if  someone ask "I can't make my sub go underwater" and you answer "don't make subs"?
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:23:12 That's pretty much the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:23:22 And it's still not a solution
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:23:49 Ok but have a better solution for arty pls
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:24:24 Just
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:24:28 Artillery
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:24:37 Turret using heavy ammo
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 19:25:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 21:03:40 <:BIG1:588443768806703124> <:BIG2:588443778554134540>
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 21:03:45 <:BIG3:588443788721258534> <:BIG4:588443798842114088>
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 21:04:12 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 21:04:57 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:47:48 Made a slightly better model for the spr7er
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:47:51 AKA upgraded spr2er
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:01 I hope they'll add arty shells
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:22 Or custom ammo for guns and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:33 With the control of speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:38 Explosion radius
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:40 Weight
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:49:50 And stuff like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:50:20 Oh no
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:50:25 Reminds me of lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:51:33 Tell me if you've seen bigger shredders btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:51:37 I need that info
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 17:51:54 I try to make one of the biggest shredder players have ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:09:27 Is this a RP or an actual event?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:09:42 Boi
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:09:56 Made by an admin?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:14:35 Hey I have a question
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:14:59 Have you ever seen a big shredder bug carrying tiny shredder bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:15:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:17:42 Head
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:17:49 OHHH
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:17:53 NICEEE
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:03 Can I see pls?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:13 I tryna make a shredder carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:28 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:41 I just need the mini design
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:18:45 It would really help
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:20:26 Very nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:22:33 What I love with shredder bugs is how customizable they are without changing drastically their performances
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:23:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:23:48 I don't like trolls
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:23:59 I prefer to actually work on shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:24:24 Just look at my spr7er
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:25:03 <@456226577798135808> Is this enough work?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:25:20 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:25:34 The design has been revamped around 5 times tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:25:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 18:32:06 Anyone remember Tank Fish?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:08:53 Hey I have a question
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:09:21 Since the new cutter will be able to nerf the shredder bugs' attack power
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:09:41 Will you guys hate on PC2 shredder bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:10:09 Shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:16:08 Hey, since a shredder bug is a type of aerial vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:16:19 We alway see military/fighter shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:16:26 But when you think about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:16:36 No one has ever made civil shredders yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:18:22 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:13:46 Enough shredder bugs, **time for some civil bugs**
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:15:24 Niceeee
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:21:07 I am coming back to this old comment just to tell you that I've took that as a challenge and successfully made one <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:22:18 Lemme take a pic
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:23:28 There
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:25:44 Oh btw
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:25:58 The mini shredder aren't as useful as the giant one
the-dump 2021-08-31 16:26:11 They're just used when the big one is too damaged to fight
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:08 It's a disconnector
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:32 Also the blades aren't made for propulsion
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:43 They're just made to stabilize the engine
the-dump 2021-08-31 17:26:55 Without it, it would start shaking
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:34:22 https://youtu.be/cZ6f27qZuNU
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:34:53 That moment when you realize Tank Fish is the one who invented the first prototypes of missile bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:35:30 He's a chad because he invented them before motor2 was out
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:36:04 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:38:31 Hey btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:38:46 I wanna make a modern frigate but
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:38:52 There's a problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:39:15 I know almost nothing about custom aquatic weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:39:24 Such as torpedos or depth charges
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:39:37 The tutorials for them are pretty rare
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:39:49 And?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:40:10 But that's not a modern frigate
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:40:20 A modern frigate relies a lot on homing missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:40:56 What's the smallest model of missile you've ever seen?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:41:33 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:41:45 Any info about depth charges?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:41:53 Or torpedos?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:42:29 Shut
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:43:09 Also i remind you that motor lock is relying on a classic glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:43:19 Not everyone likes to exploit glitches
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:43:29 Wait what
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:44:04 Yeah but still
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:44:14 Anyone remember when the lock option was gone?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:47:54 Motor lock can be a waste of space if you tryna build something huge
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:48:12 And?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:48:28 You have 1 designer rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:48:53 Take aircraft carriers for example
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:49:05 I dont't see many carriers with motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:49:34 Well not everyone is a designer
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:50:06 The world doesn't turn around yourself, it's not because you have a bigger brain than average that it means everyone around you is stupid lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:50:20 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:07 Oh yeah sea mines
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:16 Anyone know a good design for sea mines?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:35 Ik you can just drop tnt on the water but
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:39 I want something nicer
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:46 Like
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:51:53 Make it look like an actual sea mine
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:54:21 I love mini vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 20:33:27 I'm working on a F712 Courbet
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 20:33:35 A french frigate
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 20:33:55 Nice ship!
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:49:15 It's quite "funny" to see that everyone thought that making anti shredder bug weapons would make them stop
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:49:21 Instead they evolved LOL
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:50:36 Atleast I'm trying to put actual work into them
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:50:48 And don't troll random people
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:51:14 What if I tell you that I even made a civil shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:51:44 Also
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:52:00 There's only one thing worst than shredder bugs.
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:52:07 Shredder balls.
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:52:38 Not if they blacklist you <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:53:54 That's why my shredder is slower than your casual annoyance <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:54:01 But heavier
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:54:16 Yes and no
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:54:26 The shredder has 2 mini shredders attached to it
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:54:37 And can stop mid flight to control them better
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:55:18 Jokes on you each have 4 propellers
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:55:37 I wonder if
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:55:47 Are there anti shredder warships?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:55:58 I remind you that they are 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:56:08 And keep spinning around eachoter
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:56:20 You must have a god aim to take them down
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:56:51 Oh btw
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:57:03 Omething I love to build are VLS
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:57:20 Rn I have a frigate with 2 bays
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 14:57:29 And I'm gonna make a RPVLS
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:04:43 Btw not all shredders are annoying
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:07 What
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:19 But in non PvP they mind their own business
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:28 Look
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:39 An airline shredder
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:43 No weapons
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:05:49 How is that annoying
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:06:07 That's not very different from a regular pc aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:06:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:06:43 Your argument is invalid
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:07:32 How is this annoying?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:08:01 A civil shredder
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:08:06 No weapons
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:08:15 Just filled with passenger seats
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:09:14 What do people use a civil airplane for in PC?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:09:40 Because I wanted something new
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:09:50 Something that is seen very rarely
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:10:20 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:10:24 Also
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:10:29 I don't make shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:20:05 What?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:20:09 Now what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 15:20:19 You prefer a classic, annoying shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 22:12:09 For a sec I thought that I was in mugen discord and that sniper got pbanned lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:29:54 To all people who think all non-motorlocked builds are trash I have 2 words for ya
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:30:01 Tank Fish
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:30:55 If we put modern tech on them, they can be decent
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:31:26 I can't
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:32:09 Also his builds are now PC classics
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:32:27 Motor 2 for example
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:32:35 Put it on it's vehicles' turrets
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:33:21 Are you saying that his builds are ugly?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:34:43 Honestly I like their look
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:35:04 But I think that's because I used to be an alpha player
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:36:08 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:36:15 Well I forgot
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:36:26 Cuz I know he explained it in a QnA video
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:37:04 I started using motor locks tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:37:23 But I don't see in what are they useful except wasting space for details
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:38:05 Or maybe bombs
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:38:12 Motorlocked bombs are cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:43:33 What's an angle lock?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:43:47 Yeah that's good too
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:44:07 My first motor lock build is a troll build lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:44:29 It's basically a small oil tanker
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:44:32 Very small
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:44:38 Only 10-12 block long
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:45:04 But filled with bombs
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:45:23 96 bombs lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:46:20 It's just a guided torpedo disguised as a mini oil tanker
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:12:45 I'm bored
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:13:01 Has anyone tips on how to make a good howitzer?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:14:32 Okie
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:16:25 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:16:39 Oh btw
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:16:44 I also wanted to ask
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:17:20 What's the smallest size possible for a "mini" frigate? (With decent VLS)
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:19:11 A ship similar to a destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:19:17 Smaller and slower
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:19:45 But generally equipped with an helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:20:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:27:20 What's the best class of military vehicle for escort?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:27:32 Haha very funny
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:28:04 1 for each category
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:30:02 I guess parasite fighters are good for that role, aren't they?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:30:24 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:30:40 But we're in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:35:15 Look, aircraft carriers were very hazardous and usually unsuccessful when they were invented. But as the developpment continued, they got more and more efficient until being actually reliable.
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:36:57 After all, why not putting a micro fighter in a bomber's bomb bay?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:37:53 But what if the parasite fighter is able to land on earth by itself?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:38:22 Carried by an aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:39:06 We have infinite fuel in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:39:16 Why are we even arguing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:40:08 Because in case of fail, the cost is very high. Imagine the tanker and the fighter both getting strafed
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:40:53 But the parasite cost less
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:41:07 Dafuq
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:46:39 Well now, are the UCAVs the best escort aircrafts?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:47:31 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:48:17 Anyway since we were arguing about an old vehicle's effectiveness in modern ages
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:48:51 Can we talk about the fact that traditionnal warships are still more represented than modern warships?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:49:08 Artillery is now a secondary weapon on ships
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:49:15 Missiles being the primary
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:49:48 Big missile battery is cooler than big gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:50:36 What
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:50:38 Wdym
general 2021-09-04 23:26:51 Tai Lung#1630 Who drew that pfp?
general 2021-09-04 23:26:59 Wait
general 2021-09-04 23:27:04 Ping fail sorry
general 2021-09-04 23:28:55 <@345527706340818944> Who drew that pfp?
general 2021-09-04 23:29:36 Why are you saying this
general 2021-09-04 23:30:07 I'm a furry
general 2021-09-04 23:30:25 What
general 2021-09-04 23:31:00 It makes awhile I stopped making shredders anyway

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 19:33:19 And at the moment it was done

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 19:33:55 It's a fighter bomber

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 19:37:54 And talking about PC tutorial makers is allowed, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 19:40:14 This is pretty rude to mock newbies, leave him be and he'll learn by himself

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 19:42:37 Also he didn't consent for you to post a picture mocking his build

plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:33:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:34:43 Chads are the one who sacrify their vehicle's fight efficiency to make it look good
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:35:12 You mean like this?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:36:23 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:36:34 Is it less annoying if AA uses rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:36:41 Like heavy AA
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:36:52 So
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:36:56 Where's the balance?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:38:13 What about frigates (with VLS)?
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:39:36 H
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:40:10 My WW1 bomber is getting targetted by 2 fighter jets (with hoverdrives) and a VTOL
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:40:13 What do I do
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:42:30 But that would make the bomber impossible to control since it's a biplane, and such speed would be ugly on a WW1 aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:42:52 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:42:56 I have a turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:43:09 Can aim from 360dg
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:43:22 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:43:30 I'll try
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:43:35 It's very compact
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:43:40 But I can try
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:47:31 Welp nvm
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:47:45 The enemy aircraft is way too fast to be hit by anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:48:05 Pretty sure the speed is over 800
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:48:18 Or atleast 700
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:48:20 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-16 18:48:27 I'm not good at calculating speed

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 18:23:37 <@719876506913865771> hi
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 14:33:14 I laughed my ass off on this ngl
general 2021-10-13 21:25:44 Yes
general 2021-10-14 18:26:48 Where did it go
general 2021-10-14 18:27:10 Ye
general 2021-10-14 18:27:36 Or people who downvotes only because of the builder's outfit
general 2021-10-14 18:28:42 But when sometimes their outfit is seen while they showcase the build they get downvoted for that
general 2021-10-14 18:29:52 I remember a guy who had a furry outfit and he posted 2 pictures of his build. On the bottom pic his avatar could be seen and for some reasons the top pic had a lot of upvotes and the bottom one a lot of downvotes
general 2021-10-14 18:33:37 What
general 2021-10-14 18:33:42 Who's Ikai
general 2021-10-14 18:33:59 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 11:52:20 Is PC2 coming out soon?
plane-crazy 2022-04-22 13:05:28 Not for everyone
general 2022-06-13 21:53:03 Hey where can I report a person from the discord server?
general 2022-06-13 21:53:35 How do I get access
general 2022-06-13 21:54:35 Done.
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 20:05:17 When was PC2 announced for the first time already?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 22:52:09 I just asked a question.
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 16:27:33 Because I don't often check on the server
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 16:28:12 I just asked when was it announced for the first time
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 16:28:18 I didn't ask when it comes out
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 16:28:36 Yeah but still it was just a question
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 16:28:55 Telling someone to shut up over a simple question is pretty rude
general 2023-07-01 22:23:50 Just bought the motor hat
If I'm lucky this might be my change to start getting into the limited market lol
general 2023-07-01 22:24:33 Wdym
general 2023-07-01 22:25:15 Wdym by limited sniper bot
general 2023-07-01 22:25:53 What
general 2023-07-01 22:26:14 What's the point
general 2023-07-01 22:27:52 Looked it up and
The holding period is the period you cannot sell it for
So basically you can't resell a limited right after buying it. You have to wait a certain ammount of time which is the holding period.
general 2023-07-01 22:28:33 Amen 🙏
