plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:27:04 Depends on the speed of what the hell you're intercepting.
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:27:09 Multirole, go ahead.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 10:28:08 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:30:38 How do I use sparkers as a barrel?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:31:01 They only have one side that can connect/weld to another block
creations-chat 2020-09-17 10:31:13 <@!540515443132334090> you there?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 10:31:36 oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:31:56 dammit i hate using cameras
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:00 any substitute for cam?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:14 I guess.
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:23 Oh, that's a good one
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:30 wait
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:35 Can you show me a pic of it in build mode?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:47 The barrel only
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:33:52 But sparkler also only have one side that welds
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:34:00 how exactly do I make a seamless connection?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:35:31 nvm I was wrong.
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:35:33 Sorry.
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:36:00 I'll try using text
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:37:22 Thanks alot, I got me a good looking barrel.
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:37:29 Now, how do I add rockets..
general 2020-09-18 06:16:45 Say "motor lock is shit and that it should be patched"
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:44:09 -mapsuggest A spase area located above 10k alt and can only be accessed when going at a certain speed. Obviously, there's no gravity, and also, control surfaces, propeller engines and jet engines don't work there, you don't die in the vacuum because that would probably be chaotic, and maybe, just maybe.. An EVA Pack that you place as a block and that you can wear, which only works in space for better movement. (Jetpack is hard to control in 0g.) Also add atmospheric re-entry that only slows down your fall and only adds burn marks or changes the colors of blocks but don't actually melt/destroy them.
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:44:52 They better
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:45:52 In my suggestion, I guess control surfaces should still work even though there's supposed to be no air in space
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:07 But props and jets shouldn't work there as props and jets need air to work
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:27 Oh shoot I forgot to add "RCS thusters" in my suggestion
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:44 RCS thrusters with automatic dampening
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:46:54 But this is map suggestion
general 2020-09-24 23:50:32 Guys what the hell the dude I played among us with a few days ago found me on discord
general 2020-09-24 23:50:37 
general 2020-09-25 00:17:41 > <@470018120317403137> Do you share servers with him?
<@289930922655088640> 
Hell no
general 2020-09-25 00:17:57 Also can't wait for that new map
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:18:39 -mapsuggest When the new map is added, make a server housing the old map for those who want to re-live the good old days of plane crazy.
general 2020-09-25 00:20:11 Yeah
general 2020-09-25 00:20:17 Can't wait to see what they'll add
general 2020-09-25 00:20:32 I really want a space area.

general 2020-09-25 00:21:41 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-30 09:32:30 I made a ranger from interstellar
creations-chat 2020-09-30 09:32:46 I made the mistake of making it scaled properly
creations-chat 2020-09-30 09:33:11 Now I don't have room for engines to make it work without using motor lock and ruining the look
creations-chat 2020-09-30 09:34:15 Can anyone help me?
creations-chat 2020-10-02 05:48:02 I built the Ranger from 
interstellar using Tactiphy's ranger as inspiration and I ended up actually copying his cockpit design just by looking at the thumbnail
creations-chat 2020-10-04 23:59:16 Go make a waffle with bf109 wings

general 2020-11-04 08:04:58 Did they fix motor lock now?
general 2020-11-04 08:05:29 Yo did they fix motor lock?
general 2020-11-04 08:05:37 Dang
general 2020-11-04 08:05:50 That's sad.
general 2020-11-04 08:06:18 I'm legit buying besieged if motor lock don't get fixed
general 2020-11-04 08:06:31 I have 20 bucks left over from my dentist appointment
general 2020-11-04 08:07:02 Roblox had to fix it
general 2020-11-04 08:07:08 They prolly did it for a reason
general 2020-11-04 08:07:16 Maybe to fix some other bugs.
general 2020-11-04 08:07:37 Motor lock was just a glitch that became mainstream
general 2020-11-04 08:07:44 So can't be mad at them for fixing it
general 2020-11-04 08:07:51 > Dont blame roblox
<@347182144873037824> 

Correct
general 2020-11-04 08:08:01 That's what I just said
general 2020-11-04 08:08:13 They probably didn't know about plane crazy motor lock
general 2020-11-04 08:08:56 Well, since motor lock is popular now
general 2020-11-04 08:09:06 The devs can just make it a feature
general 2020-11-04 08:09:31 What I'm scared about is if the patched and fixed motor lock would work the same as before
general 2020-11-04 08:09:46 Is it fixed now?
general 2020-11-04 08:09:52 Oh
general 2020-11-04 08:10:09 Will this new motor lock work the same as before?
general 2020-11-04 08:10:38 Will the new motor lock you're currently making work the same as before?
general 2020-11-04 08:10:58 Because I don't want to reconfigure every single motor in my builds
general 2020-11-04 08:11:36 <@456226577798135808> aren't you the dude who said you hate motor lock like back in September?
general 2020-11-04 08:12:11 Motor lock pulls in blocks by half a block
general 2020-11-04 08:12:19 <@555965248184778753> yes please

general 2020-11-04 08:39:20 For real tho, motor lock getting patch is something we should've expected
general 2020-11-04 08:39:35 Rick shouldve turned it into a feature as soon as it was becoming mainstream
general 2020-11-04 08:39:55 Well, motor lock isn't even a feature
general 2020-11-04 08:40:04 It's a glitch that became mainstream
general 2020-11-04 08:40:09 <@715802250647175198> idk
general 2020-11-04 08:40:31 Yeah, I hate sitting infront of my pc for like two minutes waiting for roblox to update

general 2020-11-04 08:42:16 Everyone silent
general 2020-11-04 08:42:47 Rick can you make a new block that just pulls stuff in by half a block
general 2020-11-04 08:43:50 > rick what if you just teleport the smaller part of the motor down by a half block with humongous force?
<@392334096560554001> 

Sounds violent and could prolly glitch alot judging from the sound of "humongous force"
general 2020-11-04 08:44:14 I'm no scripter so I can't rlly make statements like that

Yet I see people with builds bigger than mine and they can safely go above the 1000 sps mark. Can anyone help? My jets are shit in terms of speed.
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 00:09:32 My pc has a 1050ti and can run games like GTA and Battlefront 2 fairly well, rarely any fps drops on those
