The Tale of noble_draconian (261632279917363200)
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:11:36 Is the game broken?
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:11:47 None of my planes are functioning, the engines wont' turn on, gear won't work, etc.
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 22:11:58 It started happening after today's update.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:12:50 I'm having the same exact bug as <@430121953656045569> and <@!387734780545990668> , literally NONE of my planes are working.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:13:05 Let me get a screenshot of the client logs.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:13:17 This bug starting occuring since today's update.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:13:57 
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:05 I only have 3 planes
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:12 2 of them are insanely small with not much on them
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:24 Actually I have 4
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:14:56 Keybinds are just not working.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:15 I did
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:16 twice
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:15:19 No success.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:09 There's a few infinite yields, one of the client scripts is probably waiting on a resource that's failing to load.
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:15 
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:41 I don't think that's related, but I'm not a dev for the game so
bug-reports 2019-02-08 22:16:42 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bug-reports 2019-02-21 18:50:09 Missiles are broken rn, pressing F or whatever key is binded to firing the missiles does not work.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:05:02 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:05:05 Did they change physics
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:05:18 my plane is like a metal brick now, it refuses to fly
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:05:27 not to mention jet fans don't animate now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:05:35 Any way I can fix my plane?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:06:08 What's also irking me is the fact that jets don't spin now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:06:19 I used to use the fan speed to indicate how fast/slow I should be going for certain manuvers
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:06:30 now I have to retrain to use the sound
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:07:07 I have my control surfaces bounded to mouse
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:07:09 I pitch up for takeoff.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:07:23 Why
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:07:38 I haven't had any issues with mouse
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:08:07 
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:08:08 *Moar nyoom*
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:08:25 My black jet looks like something form a spy movie lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:08:28 *from
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:09:34 ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:09:43 My landing gear just spazzed out and dragged my plane down with it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:09:46 now I'm in oblivion
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:10:03 Ok legit this physics change broke my plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:10:07 I can't fix it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:10:54 welp
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:11:03 I guess I have to make a completely new plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:11:17 It's unrelated to the mouse.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:11:26 It's completely unrelated.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:11:55 I can tell you for a fact my control surfaces are functioning as intended.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:12:16 You must have had someone take a dump in your cereal this morning my guy
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:10 And I'm stating the solution wouldn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:15 Dude ur being toxic lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:24 Go drink some milk
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:34 have a cookie
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:36 Cookies are good
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:13:44 She is
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:03 Is this server riddled with toxic peeps
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:10 She offered me a 'solution'
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:20 All I said was "I can assure you it's unrelated"
Her : "You're dillusional"
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:28 Please read an argument before getting involved.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:41 (Or just don't get involved if it doesn't concern you!)
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:54 Ah, personal bias.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:14:58 Makes sense.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:18:21 <@!163143541160148992> I did lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:18:34 Doesn't justify her calling me "dillusional" and her sister hopping in
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:19:24 <@266718250501406722> Thx I forgot to turn on google autocorrect
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:26:16 I need to get my weight to be closer to the center of my jet, any methods of doing this or do I just have to stack more crap on the top?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:27:54 My black jet was great at everything except vertical manuvers.
It could hover, had great aerodynamics (could fly/turn well), was pretty durable as it could operate with just 1 turbine working and could work with a bunch of its wing surface destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:28:01 Now it's broken ._.
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:29:59 How well does it turn
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:35:43 I don't get why this isn't flying, the balance seems right and it worked flawlessly before the physics change
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:36:12 This goes 520 SPS
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:36:43 I have some super engines on the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:37:18 I'm tryna fix my jet but physics just seems broken
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:37:30 Even the example starter plane is behaving much differently
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:37:32 it turns a lot slower
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:37:51 <@!163143541160148992> I have some C-5 galaxies in the airbase right next to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:38:03 I see them flying in and taking off all the time
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:38:35 Lemme try a pvp server
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:38:39 maybe the server I'm in is broken
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:39:12 I hate it when people make "lag machines"
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:39:56 What is happening
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:39:56 Now my paint data isn't loading
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:40:35 Ok what the hell
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 09:40:40 My plane works flawlessly in pvp servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:18 Were physics updated?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:11:21 My plane is being wonky again
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:34:29 Do the regular servers have different physics than the PVP servers?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:34:45 ..excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:35:10 Lol what
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:35:29 You're the one acting salty here, I literally asked a question
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:36:13 Oh my god the salt is real lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:36:23 Anyways back to what I was asking
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:36:45 <@456226577798135808> I just hopped in to ask a question and he/she was like "plz go away", instigating an issue lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:36:52 So anyways back to my original quesitson
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:37:05 Oh my god what is it with this server ahhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:37:11 K so
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:37:47 Do the regular servers have different physics than PVP servers? In the normal servers my plane behaves normally, it flies smoothly, turns, etc.
In the PVP servers, my plane barely turns and nosedives to the ground
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:37:56 Was there an update or something that was only applied to the regular servers?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:38:48 Why aren't plane physics ran on the client?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:38:53 That would solve physics being affected by lag
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:39:05 Ok if they are then why do lag machines screw with client physics?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:40:28 If a lag machine on the server is affecting client physics, there's something somewhere on the client codebase that's not optimized
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:40:54 Cuz I was tryna pvp and my plane was just all over the place 😂
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:42:07 But if you have network ownership over your plane then I don't see how the server would affect anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:44:24 If client has network ownership of a `BasePart` instance, the client replicates the position to the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:44:29 It's the reason why teleport exploits work
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:48:32 lol anyone know any good aircraft designs to fight a cancerous plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:49:44 My current "anti cancer aircraft" design is literally a mini jet that goes 0 to 600 KTS instantly
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:09 Oh no I'm not talking about kamikazes
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:22 I'm talking about aircraft that just float in place and can do tight loops with instant acceleration
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:33 *shudder*
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:36 All the bacon hairs doing it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:48 Then there's the normies like me saying "BRO JUST USE AN ACTUAL JET"
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:50:52 Oh god
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:51:13 I find it funny how 80% of the creationsI see are just direct copies of youtube tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:54:58 aIrPlAnE
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:55:29 It's a 4 turbine jet
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:55:36 It's surprisingly aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:55:39 tight turns
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:55:47 wide range of speed
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:55:56 It sucks at vertical combat though
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:56:01 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:56:02 I don't lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:56:09 The rocket turns are for when I'm hovering
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:56:13 cuz I have hover rockets underneath
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:56:17 I don't lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:57:55 But yeah, my plane is oddly aerodynamic. The rockets on the sides are for manuvering while hovering < 100 knots
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:58:09 I also have reverse thrust turbines on the sides for when I'm landing
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:58:18 or I need to quickly slow down without changing my engine thrust power level
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:58:33 knots/sps
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 21:58:35 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:00:28 "shoot me pls"
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:01:08 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:03:26 I've seen moderators that were < 13 before.
The result was uh... very toxic.
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:03:50 I'm `-math.huge`
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:04:18 I don't report people to Discord unless they're making scam bots and flooding DMs/servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:04:22 If you're < 13 I don't care
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:04:46 that's a snek
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 22:04:54 🐍
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:07:48 Some dude knows how to crash a server
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:08:04 Shortly after he said this, everyone disconnected from the server, then I lagged out as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:08:28 The developers should add in anti lag machine
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:08:37 Oh rip lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:08:46 ~~ban him from the game~~
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 04:09:32 Literally half the pvp servers I go into has someone tryna crash the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 05:07:54 If I had a penny for every time some kid used an unrealistic rocket spammed box that could turn instantly
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 05:07:57 I'd be rich lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:43:34 I can't get a server without some toxic kido crashing the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:43:37 
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:43:41 *server crashes 3 seconds later*
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:43:54 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:44:40 hOwAbOuT i crash the SeRvEr
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:44:57 *windows BSOD*
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:01 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:16 Design looks nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:28 Should be  a dark grey tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:32 To match the color of a jet
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:43 oH oKaY
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:53 nah
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:56 Dark grey / black
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:45:58 looks better
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:46:16 Nope.avi
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:46:43 ooo
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:47:18 My turbine plane is pretty nimble when the server isn't dying
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:47:24 but if there's a lag machine it just nosedives into the ground
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:47:52 My plane has 4 large turbines
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:47:56 it looks like something out of a spy movie tbh
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:47:58 Lemme get paic
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:48:00 *pic
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:48:19 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/398278108907700227/558417863443218432/D2N0joeXQAAlPpt.png
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:48:45 Noice
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:48:58 I use reverse thrust turbines to quickly slowdown if needbe
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:49:39 oh so I came up with the perfect plane to fight cancerous ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:49:51 It's literally a rod with control surfaces spammed on all 4 sides
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:49:57 and rockets in the back
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:50:36 But yeah my quad turbine jet has a flaw tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:50:42 It can't do loops or anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:50:48 so if ur attacking me from underneath / above
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:50:51 There's not much I can do
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:50:59 I have to be roughly the same Y elevation as you to do damage reliably
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:51:14 It can pitch up and down pretty quickly
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:51:20 but it just sucks at turning sideways
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:51:22 while pitched down/up
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:51:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:52:37 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384021699466756107/559857783051255840/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:52:41 wth discord
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:52:42 what u doin
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:52:48 No
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:52:50 I said discord
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:53:03 It like didn't send my message
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:53:40 My jet turns on a dime when physics isn't screwing up
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:53:50 It is
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:53:52 It has turbine engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:53:57 Technically making it a jet 😉
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:54:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:54:07 I thought you were talking about my jet
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:54:45 Ok I swear to god if I get one more triggered kid who decides to crash the server ima just switch games
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:08:05 There's a bug rn, engines don't work in regular non pvp servers
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:09:36 My jet is completely broken, the W/S keybinds don't work at all
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:10:46 Since about 30 minutes ago, none of my planes work properly, all of the keybinds are completely broken.
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:00 I've rejoined multiple times to no avail.
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:34 oh
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:35 Ignore me
bug-reports 2019-04-01 00:11:43 f u e l
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:12:32 Is there a way to disable the fuel? My plane is eating through it like no tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:12:47 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:12:51 Thank you <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:14:07 Honestly something needs to be done to prevent the raged kids from crashing the server at will
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:15:09 This guy is literally spam resetting
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:15:14 half the server already lagged out
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:15:32 Every time the server unfreezes he asks "who froze?"
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:15:49 <@!163143541160148992> Honestly resetting isn't needed, there's a back button for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:16:08 Omg he's still trying to crash the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:17:21 He's still going at it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:17:30 The server drops connection for like 40 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:18:24 This guy is spam resetting trying to make his own 'vip server'
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:18:25 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:18:43 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:18:46 HE LAGGED HIMSELF OUT
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:19:08 oof
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:19:44 Wait are you in my server?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:19:51 o
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:21:42 The rockets are stupid sometimes, they'll just go AROUND the target
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:37:44 Were the physics updated? My plane flies so well now
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:37:56 It turns on a dime
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:37:59 even with laggy creations
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:23:50 Oooo that's a good loophole
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 00:02:11 👀

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:01:19 <@!486552769612742668> Display drivers are uh...drivers that make your display work.

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:24 time to make some kiddies rage in the pvp servers
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:42 *backups*
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:20:51 Backups are a thing 👀
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:21:01 If my desktop dies I won't lose anything
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:21:35 if you bought a PC and it died after a month, take it back to where u bought it, it's probably under manufacturer warranty
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:13 <@!217336009455566848> u can join my server
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:14 ;D
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:16 agh
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:18 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:22:18 I got kicked
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:25:27 Ok got a new server
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:27:55 Half the servers I joined were new
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:28:28 If the servers aren't updating then there's a flaw in ur update logic lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 20:28:41 cutter blocks yeet whatever they touch
general 2020-03-31 10:04:41 `math.huge`
general 2020-03-31 10:05:13 Yes
general 2020-04-29 04:46:28 I usually bind flaps to U and J in flight sims
general 2020-04-29 04:46:36 V for speedbreaks
general 2020-04-29 04:46:38 etc
general 2020-04-29 04:47:27 peak performance
general 2020-04-29 04:48:48 For that yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:26:24 Are there any plans to implement game mechanics that will counter the cutter bugs?
The meta is getting out of hand...
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:26:37 Can't join any pvp servers without 2-4 of them
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:27:11 Yeah I have one, but they're too fast and the explosions are prone to latency issues (I hit them on my screen, but the server is a few milliseconds behind so they don't register)
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:27:29 I'd rather not have to use a kamikaz every time I join a pvp server lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:28:12 I'll have to try that, been doing it manually
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:30:27 Nah this cutterbug user is just spamming "Ez" in the chat lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:33:42 Permaban isn't the right option lol - they're simply using mechanics that exist in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:33:53 The best solution is to implement mechanics that punish the use of cutters and the likes
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:35:07 It'd be like banning players from destiny for using the sword glitch to jump gaps - it just doesn't make sense
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:40:59 Ok im boutta keep hopping servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:41:03 This is getting nuts lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:30 I think I'm done with this game for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:35 Every single server has cutterbug users
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:51:57 Hello 👋
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:54:58 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 06:55:03 I take it the exterior is razers?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:00 Please patch the cutterbugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:11 I'm tired of joining pvp servers and seeing 2-3 of them in every. Single. Server.
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:21 The game is literally not fun because of this
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:27:52 "just blow them up lmao"
Really hard to do when they're spread across the size of a runway tethered with rope
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:28:00 with barely any solid segments
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:28:14 Like this has been a problem in the game for months
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:04 Welp
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:08 I guess I'm done with this game for a while
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:25 It's a struggle getting a pvp server that isn't filled with cutterbugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:27 or variants of them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:41 Not sure, never watched the tutorial vids on them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:53 They use rope constraints and a bunch of control surfaces to rotate in any direction
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:55 at high speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:06 and they have the cutting blocks all over them
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:11 so if they hit you they can yeet your plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:17 they pivot on a dime
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:54:23 mmm 3 cutterbugs in one server
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:46 Is there any good way to counter cutter bugs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:50 Pvp is unplayable rn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:56:52 has been for weeks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 05:57:30 This cutterbug goes mach speed and turns on a dime
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 06:00:09 Doesn't help that tnt hits barely register
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:55:10 I think I'm permanently done with pvp lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:56:08 Every server I join just has insane planes that either:
- Turn 180 degrees on the spot at 14 knots
- Use cutter bug mechanics
- Speed up to mach 5 then instantly stop
- etc
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:56:50 Because I have better things to do than waste my time in a server consisting of planes that quite literally should not even work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:57:13 > says the one with shredder bug
I don't even have a shredder bug \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:57:28 <@!439783199988514817> Imagine utilizing bugs to completely destroy pvp servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:58:30 > you were using suicide missile
Because I was fighting planes abusing physics glitches to quite literally turn on the spot whilst instantly accelerating and decclerating
What did you expect me to do lmao
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:59:00 Imagine being this toxic
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:59:20 Imagine being toxic \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:00:24 > dry comeback
It's not meant to be a comeback. It's a fact. You guys are sitting here glorifying the use of bugs whilst dunking on players that actually want an enjoyable pvp experience without having to deal with insanely unrealistic planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:02:00 > this resh guy really thinks he's the victim
>Be me
>Points out consistent use of bugs in pvp servers
>Watch as the community enters a seizure over pointing it out
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:02:34 > its a roblox game you cant complain about overpowered stuff
The platform the game takes place on is not even relevant here, lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:18 So don't I, but instead I have to deal with toxic community members whilst running into players that consistently abuse the literal hell out of physics bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:50 > so do please shut the fuck up
Why don't you not act like a biggot please
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:07 How am I a hyppocrate lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:11 All I've done is prove my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:32 >Abusing glitches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:39 False
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:42 Here's what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:05 I came in here and stated that running into players that abuse physics glitches in literally every pvp server is irritating
And everyone decided to have a seizure over it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:13 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:19 Oh my god 😂
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:47 You guys are so *toxic*, holy hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:29 > if you cant handle how pvp is then do piss off mate
Right here. This right here is my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:07:59 <@456226577798135808> Literally you and basically anyone else in this channel rn with a few exceptions:
"NO YOU CANT JUST CRITICIZE THE GAME! NOOOOO :(((("
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:08:58 I'm not 'bitching', I criticized pvp. And the moment someone even remotely criticizes any aspect of the game the quality of the server degrades into a pile of crud.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:12 See you simply prove my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:52 <@456226577798135808> Consistently spamming pictures of my damaged plane doesn't add anything other than proving my point
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:16 > Imagine crying over pvp
Bro I'm not even close to mad lol, I find this highly amusing
The fact that everyone here has to collectively bandwagon on the hate train the instant someone even says ***anything*** about the state of pvp
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:31 Not what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:38 But see whatever you want
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:12:05 I am not lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:12:35 For one your level of toxicity doesn't help
Secondly I fail to see how I'm the problem when I actually build planes that *don't* attempt to abuse glitches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:24 <@!645128367611445248> Using motors to pivot 180 degrees within a .5 foot radius, with instant acceleration and deceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:59 Yes call the mods, so they can scroll up and see you:
- Cussing
- Consistently attacking me
- Spamming
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:30 I'm not raging over anything lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:44 <@!434989303882579981> Scroll up lol. You'll see plenty of it.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:16:36 > reshi, please understand that the whole community is not gonna adjust to justa  one person thinking differently
Yes so that gives you all a valid excuse to attack people that think otherwise. Perfect logic, I love it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:06 Every time I've come to this server it's been nothing but a toxic response
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:17:43 > if you dont like it
> leave it
My point is proven here
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:29 > what happened here
One guy points out a problem with pvp and everyone loses their minds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:53 <@!707991071476547745> I dunno what you could have reported me for, I haven't cussed, directly attacked anyone, or spammed
As for you guys, I cannot say the same.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:20:12 Oh my god 😂
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:09 I'm still here bud \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:39 <@!283153622496182274> Not a mod for them, no
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:51 You must have me confused with someone else, there's another "Reshiram" there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:21:56 Nope, not UD either
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:22:27 > I am raging over this community tearing themselves apart
Doesn't take much for people here to attack other people.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:23:39 Yeah that's who you probably confused with me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:45 Also
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:53 @ the people who 'reported' me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:24:58 Moot point because you were the ones breaking server rules 😎
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:25:41 Wanna bet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:27:10 > it gets forgetten
Unless it gets reported \:-)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:27:22 I will.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:35:10 Off topic but when large object stores are added to the platform, we can most likely make much larger and complicated builds if rick implements them

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:46:52 Lol I found the funniest way to counter cutters
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:46:58 Blacklist + turret spamming fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:47:11 Makes them mad half the time
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:53:45 Sadge
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:53:56 But yeah I made an entire server rage lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 03:15:09 Quick question
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 03:15:40 I've been noticing some builds with really fast rockets - how is this accomplished?
Is it with rope constraints or something?
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 03:15:48 Tried some experiments to reproduce it but couldn't lol
