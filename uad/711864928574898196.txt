general 2021-01-27 12:58:23 making bad critisism of others shows unhappiness with yourself, cant you congratulate people for what they achieved rather than put them down for what they havent done?
general 2021-01-27 12:59:17 also it was the redesigning that made the time, the first prototype was done after an hour and a half
general 2021-01-27 13:00:28 lol
general 2021-01-27 13:00:40 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2021-01-27 13:01:35 bro its rick gaming
general 2021-01-27 13:01:51 doing what i do best
general 2021-01-27 13:03:35 you immediately kek'd after i said that original message because i am a not as skilled as you, and to jump onto criticism without acknowledging the pros isnt constructive criticism
general 2021-01-27 13:04:36 what a great reply to an debate
general 2021-01-27 13:04:46 peak of humanity
general 2021-01-27 13:07:04 listen dont give criticism if you cant do it right.
No one will listen to listen to lists of bad things.
labelling whats good and bad is the best type of criticism, at least then i can see what i have done right.
general 2021-01-27 13:07:44 also making lesser skilled people feel bad about their hard work isnt being a good person
general 2021-01-27 13:07:54 define an essay then
general 2021-01-27 13:08:15 mb essay
general 2021-01-27 13:08:33 read the rest of the arguement
general 2021-01-27 13:08:56 i aint saying it is
general 2021-01-27 13:09:29 'one persons trash is another mans arte'
general 2021-01-27 13:10:05 and shaming someone for what they have done is pretty horrible
general 2021-01-27 13:14:47 ok listen i dont see the big idea about shaming someone for their build.
Is it a tutorial? no
Did they try? yes
Are they happy with it? yes
To immediatly point out the problems and not highlight the solutions or achievements isnt criticism, its just being plain mean, and the problem is the fact that you are all higher skill level than me, just because you can do cool motor lock builds doesnt mean you can make other people feel bad about their builds.
No one starts the game being good at the game, me you and the next guy were all bad at one point, and im not saying its good, im saying its not helpful saying its bad.
Im stopping the arguement here im am just gonna ignore the following replies cuz there are more things to worry about atm
general 2021-01-27 13:15:53 im dissapointed not hurt
general 2021-01-27 13:16:20 criticism? i think not
