general 2020-10-20 23:28:56 Does anyone know the record for most planes on an aircraft carrier?
general 2020-10-20 23:29:17 ...Thank you
general 2020-10-20 23:29:27 I expected like 100
general 2020-10-20 23:29:44 I'm going to have 40+ on my triple deck carrier
general 2020-10-20 23:30:06 No in plane crazy
general 2020-10-20 23:30:19 Yeah irl on gerlad R ford is hella
general 2020-10-20 23:30:26 Gerald*
general 2020-10-20 23:30:46 Well thank you gtg
general 2020-10-20 23:41:50 Yo wassup
general 2020-10-20 23:41:56 brb Doing things
general 2020-10-21 01:12:35 Nice Azur lane character Miin, thats my 2nd fav
general 2020-10-21 01:13:22 Asia has the most volcanoes out of all the continents
general 2020-10-21 01:14:06 Africa is massive but they don't have too many volcanoes
general 2020-10-21 01:14:52 When Yellowstone erupts... Demons will come out too lol
general 2020-10-21 01:15:50 Wasn't godzilla from Japan? Like arised from there or the nuclear blasts in the Pacific?
general 2020-10-21 01:16:53 I mean there were many ideas where Godzilla should've came from, but I believe the Pacific one is most popular
general 2020-10-21 01:17:45 Hey guys real quick, which country in ww2 had the most sexy ship designs?
general 2020-10-21 01:19:05 Damn, I love me so Imperial Japanese carriers, but German battleships are like damn they're hella fine
general 2020-10-21 01:19:32 But Prinz Eugens and Bismarck are like.. Damn
general 2020-10-21 01:20:11 Prinz Eugen wasn't really a battleship so I can't say that, but Tripitz was lit
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:57:46 Is that good lol
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:58:48 Sorry its laggy with 7k blocks and hella engines to fly
creations-chat 2020-10-21 03:00:37 Oh, ok good lol, thought my pictures didn't come out well. Glad you liked my build
general 2020-10-21 03:10:29 I made this build (shown in creation chat) It's 7k blocks, flies with reduced gravity though because my computer would lag if I added too many thrust to make it fly without reduced gravity. Flies actually very well for a flying sci-fi battleship. But if I could enter this for like a ship rank, would that be allowed since it's not "actually" a ship?
general 2020-10-21 03:10:59 Im saying could I enter it into a rank
general 2020-10-21 03:11:07 Ok thank you
general 2020-10-21 03:12:46 10 upvotes in creation voting?
general 2020-10-21 03:13:35 I'm just 3 off then I guess unless downvotes
general 2020-10-21 03:13:52 Well upvote it if you guys like the ship
general 2020-10-21 03:14:26 I had no room left because I wanted a 4 long fold
general 2020-10-21 03:14:48 Lol ironically
general 2020-10-21 03:15:19 Well, I mean I guess rank wouldn't even bother me anyways
general 2020-10-21 03:15:25 But thanks to those who helped me
general 2020-10-21 03:15:57 Alright cool, thanks again

creations-chat 2021-01-06 07:08:18 I need people for the team build competition. My ship is a modern Russian vessel and whoever is making a modern fleet I'd like to join
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 00:28:25 I guess an or class cruiser is better

help 2021-01-07 04:22:27 How do you get something in hof? (hall of fame)
help 2021-01-07 04:26:07 Ah alright thank you
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 04:19:36 Wait dog?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 04:19:49 I thought it was more like a cat lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 04:21:23 joke or joe lmao
creations-chat 2021-01-12 20:54:34 To make it seem more realistic and cooler, try shading the ship in different colors. Like different shades of grey or whatever the color is for it
creations-chat 2021-01-12 20:56:35 Also it's dope and I'd give it 8.5/10 until the shades are done
creations-chat 2021-01-13 19:12:08 It looks good, but maybe conceal the ropes more? Idk if you can, but it looks good either way
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:13:03 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/800926129963663391 this deserves so much more upvotes, just look at it, it's beautiful. Nice work <@!671156550546751550> Ah, thats good then, sadly not into hof smh
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:16:40 That was also my first thought, but in WW2, there were thousands of trenches built tho. No, in ww2 like Japan in Iwo Jima, they built tunnels and trenches. Yeah really famous for ww1 for sure
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:19:32 This man longtim3 is downvoting everything 😂  weirdo
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:23:12 Although that trench is dope, 9/10
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:26:02 Mine? Also the ship above the white is mine. The white is my friend's super which I credited. So idk why you care about who took the pic or not. That's not mine and idk who's that was. It wasn't a priv server and people went to airport to look at our ships.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 04:28:10 Proof it's mine. But yeah, I don't mind if you downvote, I just thought someone was out just downvoting for no reasons lmao
general 2021-01-20 06:06:00 I only got 27 days on mine smh
bot-central 2021-01-25 02:39:21 !rank
creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:30:57 For real, thats more than worthy to be in hof, thats just a legend build right there
creations-chat 2021-01-27 19:36:24 rickje would be proud like this once he sees the ghidorah-🥲 lol
bot-central 2021-01-27 19:39:44 $rank
creations-chat 2021-01-28 03:16:49 Well you need the gun underneath so maybe make a cylinder gun under the nose so it looks alike and isnt as pointy. Also I would take off the pyramid block
creations-chat 2021-01-28 04:54:41 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/804198592121405460 This is actually a cool A-10, looks unique and futuristic
general 2021-01-31 19:39:00 4"3 thats hot
creations-chat 2021-02-02 00:19:45 How many folds is it gonna be?
creations-chat 2021-02-02 03:48:54 Super hornet most likely
creations-chat 2021-02-03 05:02:13 How does someone post several pictures in creations without them being seperate?
creations-chat 2021-02-03 05:39:57 Alr thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-14 05:26:26 Thank you, some people don't know where to start a simple canon so I just made it for anyone who'd need it
creations-chat 2021-02-14 14:36:11 The right side from the view we're looking at maybe a bit more grey on the wings idk
creations-chat 2021-02-15 23:08:49 Its hot lol
creations-chat 2021-02-16 19:37:59 Lol the plane is supposed to be like that, also the plane is 9/10
creations-chat 2021-02-16 19:41:51 Maybe like 1 more block towards the engines so it looks more thicker idk
creations-chat 2021-02-18 02:32:56 Looks a bit blocky so 4/10, maybe add detail and stuff on the sides. Also add windows on the side cuz how else will the driver see
creations-chat 2021-02-18 02:36:09 I could easily, but I really dislike how that ship looks. Too long/rectangular. Why?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 06:15:38 People may really liked their builds and get compliments in the game but then come here and get smacked with downvotes here it may upset them idk
creations-chat 2021-02-18 06:21:40 When you realize Essex is better than Yorktown lol jk
creations-chat 2021-02-18 06:37:17 Honestly american carriers just look bland
creations-chat 2021-02-18 06:39:25 Well you can make anything look real nice if you try well enough. But all Americans carriers just look the same, I wouldn't notice which is which lol
creations-chat 2021-02-18 18:07:19 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/812003639999987742 <@!414359638302130176>  Make the front more detailed, like the pole at the front or more things happening could really make it eye catching. The back is very amazing tho
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:06:02 Imagine downvoting, I don't see a reason to waste my time to dislike someone's build
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:08:03 It's just nice to see a community that shows off their builds.. Just odd to see people downvote so much lol
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:40:03 nvm lolol someone already said that
creations-chat 2021-02-19 23:44:08 Bro <@!466793357318815744> , that's actually pretty badass. Sorry idk if I'm even allowed to ping mods about their builds but whateves lolol
creations-chat 2021-02-19 23:46:09 For real, how the hell can someone downvote stuff like that, the adesity is incredible (maybe make the planes shoot out of the catapults on the yamato like missles)
creations-chat 2021-02-20 17:37:22 I mean, that'd be fun to watch people edit messages to argue back and forth lol
creations-chat 2021-02-20 23:57:24 ye I dont mind
creations-chat 2021-02-21 02:52:34 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/812833669672468571 I didn't really get much feedback, but how's the ship? And what's something I should maybe improve on
creations-chat 2021-02-21 03:01:56 They are large sails, there isn't 1x7 wedges and crap like that. So couldn't. The chinese symbols wouldn't been hard to do if the sail was mainly all wedges

creations-chat 2021-03-25 17:39:30 Thats why I hated that last Jedi movie.... Seemed stupid how a transport ship rammed a ship of that size. Kinda just made star wars feel like wouldn't any smaller ship just ram into any ship now. Or wtf happened to shields
creations-chat 2021-03-25 17:43:27 I'm glad tho that disney/star wars added the very dark side of kylo ren killing his father. Made it feel more dark lol

creations-chat 2021-03-28 02:57:42 Everything balanced as things should be -Thanos
creations-chat 2021-03-28 04:01:01 Still... Things that aren't even crazy effort at all like a military bed and a pillow that was made like 2 weeks ago got over 60 upvotes... That would've took at least 1 minutes. I believe pixel art is pretty epic and unique (unless the ones thats obv copied)
creations-chat 2021-03-28 04:03:03 Thats a detailed example on how to give feedback lol
creations-chat 2021-03-29 20:37:05 I'm trying to make an azur lane space fleet. Just DM me if you wanna join making mini spaceships

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:25:07 Yeah a space fleet
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:25:34 Here's an example of a ship we make
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:25:50 You make your own azur lane spaceship but its like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:26:37 Well you're in luck, you can make mini ver of them
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:26:59 Because we do fleet battles and for less lag we try and make them small and less than 2 folds
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:27:28 Lol all good
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:27:41 If its not a capital ship then it could be smaller
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:27:45 Like 1 fold
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:27:53 I meant no fold
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:28:34 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 03:28:48 Just hit me up if you still want to join
