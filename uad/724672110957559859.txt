plane-crazy 2023-06-19 22:32:01 heres a very silly dragon i made
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 22:54:38 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-19 22:55:22 there has been an emergency
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:16:27 Piloting lesson 1: Control
Lets say you are going a speed of 1000. You see that thing on the bottom of your keyboard? Thats the spacebar. DO NOT PRESS IT. YOU WILL DIE
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:46:52 basically yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:48:15 Additional info: There are solutions to accidentally pressing this. I removed my space bar from my keyboard and made it a seperate button instead as an example. There are many solutions.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:54:19 the shredder bugs cut the carrier
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:54:24 so i cut their life support
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:54:26 :)
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:28:42 You my sir are going to go flying even more judging by how glitchy parachutes get at high speeds.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:29:16 Anyways, you will loose control of your plane's guns, missiles, and throttle.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:29:35 (Unless it were an eject seat)
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:30:42 The parachute could still glitch but it is possible to survive, just with taking that risk.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:36:22 Lesson 2: Speed. Going fast is always fun. Flying abseloutely knowhere, dogfighting at 2000 studs (100 meters) per minute, doing sick stunts in the air, its great fun in all. Sometimes you have to go slow for things and it is great caution because going too slow will send you slowly to the ground to your enemies. Going fast makes your missiles always go faster, while you actually go faster than your rounds.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:48:52 Yes.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:54:19 Lesson 3: Taking care of pests (Shredder Bugs). Shredder bugs. The most basic and trash build in history of plane crazy. Anyone that has seen one has probably thought "Wow this thing is a nuisance!". Always remember, have good engines. Make sure you are faster and have more mobility than their stupid spinny bug. The most effective hit spot is in the center, seperating their wings from the front, making them loose aerodynamics. Keep trolling them till they leave. The server you are in will thank you.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:56:14 Evade them. Shredder ball has only forward movement and has to make frequent stops just to move in a different direction.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:57:27 Another solution to this is letting them follow you to just above the void. If they go too fast downward, they will die.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:58:35 That is a third solution.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:59:15 3rd time was the charm
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 14:59:38 Sure.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:00:07 (for the people that put a cutter on it especially)
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:01:01 bathorom break
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:07:14 Lesson 3.5: Dont play PvP mode.  Shredder bugs can't piss you off anymore if you dont have to deal with them.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:10:14 Lesson 3.5953: Use your imagination and get a fly swatter.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:14:17 Lesson 4: Actually hitting people. Always attempt to keep their tail to your missiles. A good way to know if it is centered with the enemy plane is to use your guns.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:14:29 Clipped like a fingernail
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:23:03 Lesson 5: Visual trust. Never trust what you see in combat. For example, I shot this plane's tail off. In reality, he still has it and is flying perfectly well. This is a common glitch with damage.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:24:17 Here it happened again but this time he is completely visible.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 15:26:08 If the part you (think) you shot off has gravity, then you actually hit them.
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 18:41:42 where is bros leg going
