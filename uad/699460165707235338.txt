bug-reports 2021-06-10 05:46:45 I cant shoot rockets (the normal pvp ones) while moving, i have to be completely still. very few other people have had the problem but i want to know if theres any way to fix it, pvp mode is almost unplayable
bug-reports 2021-06-10 19:47:28 i mean i cant shoot my rockets at all, like no matter what, the only thing that works is not moving at all, and that makes the game less fun becuase i like to use things like fighters and tanks, but theyre basically uselless.
help 2021-06-11 00:10:01 every time i reload my save or join another game, my barrel (the sparklers) always rotate, i dont know if theres any way to fix it but if there is please tell me.
help 2021-06-11 00:11:43 ok ill try that, thanks

creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:49:50 then report me, i just wanted to show everyone his build that he felt proud of, and the fact that this community is so bad that everyone just instantly says its trash is disgusting, like show some love for the effort he put in
creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:51:53 its not like ur builds didnt used to look like a piece of butter, everyone has to start from somewhere calm down
creations-chat 2021-06-11 15:56:42 im not blind ive seen it like 5 times, its more meaning dont just go in a game take a pic of someones build and say, hey look at this thing i made. i said it was by him, and the only reason it might be cheating the rules is because of the fact u have to be level 3
general 2021-06-14 09:25:31 no

creations-chat 2021-06-19 05:10:38 no glass, untextured grill, good other than that, maybe add light blocks behind or near the headlights, even in day it looks alot better
creations-chat 2021-06-19 05:16:08 <@!700689873237180529> admins can delete what they think is low effort or breaks the rules, and <@!738702049113538600> try making the headlights legacy glass with a light block behind

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:20:35 yes and <@!200793484053970944> what specifically is wrong about it, what isnt, to your take up a whole plot of locking motors to make a bump, standards
creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:22:37 ur looking at the longer versions, theres ones where theyre more stubby and the back is taller <@!200793484053970944> lemme just wait a few hours to speak again AHEM RICKJE
creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:25:41 -the one i used along with some more all i searched up was gustav gun and used the stubbier ones, and if you were corrected just accept it i dont want to start a big argument, and so what if i dont have the same amount of motor lock as a girl has makeup on her face
creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:29:28 am i supposed to have an individual angle lock for each wheel? or just make it smaller? and brb gimme like 15 mins
creations-chat 2021-06-24 11:26:55 anyone know what i should do for the wheel covers/armor, theres 2 main designs but im not sure how do do either, if ur willing to give me an example just search gustav gun on google
