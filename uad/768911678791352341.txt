creations-chat 2021-09-14 23:20:12 not happeing man i think you wont get a 20 score but maybe if you built a LEGIT creation like a aircraft carreir thennnnnnnnn maybe you will get expert shipwright
creations-chat 2021-09-14 23:23:27 ok maybe add some motor lock towers to the SIDE and then make some adjustments and what plane is that

creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:00:06 u didnt even get the name right, that a f35 right there u have
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:02:33 guys it a fricken f35 because it has a single engine AND it is a modern stealth fighter, AND it has the weird engine intakes
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:31:26 f35 tho has one engine BUT two intakes and its intakes are on side NOT bottom
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:34:29 yes but only one for foward movement, but that isnt a typical "engine" its a lift engine and specifically used for vtol asisst
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:36:37 but its a conceled engine so it doesnt count as a normal engine but sure if u say so
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:38:47 that aint me it someone else but yes krmgames u arent entirely wrong there is three f35 variants and only one variant actualy uses vtol and that variant is the naval variations so get wrecked
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:42:13 guys how bout this stop argueing im done with it but all of u arent wrong but arent right. and there is no marine variant of any planes because marines are sea and land operations so no there is no marine variant because marines focus on surface operation
creations-chat 2021-11-08 23:44:25 o wait nvm im dumb today but yes u are completely correct
creations-chat 2021-11-12 18:34:36 THAT IS REALY GOOD, but maybe make propellers bit longer

creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:17:30 nah man. the plane is light. its a flying skateboard
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:39:09 there aint a difference. just that the one thats landing has his airbrakes deployed. O I SEE NOW. NOT THE ONE THATS LANDING. WHEN ITS IN FLIGHT THE INTAKES ARE TRYING TO GET MORE AIR INTO ENGINES OR FOR AERODYNAMICS. ITS MOVABLE
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:43:06 hes saying you dont have to change it
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:51:48 i know. but not all planes work like that
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:57:14 bro how are u already mad. its just a wing and a plane.

creations-chat 2022-01-07 23:31:51 ur good at phototshoping. but i actually have control somehow. i just walk on the wing tips to turn.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 15:25:39 okay so. anyone like stunt planes?
creations-chat 2022-01-10 15:37:59 the wing has black n white. but then give me a color scheme
creations-chat 2022-01-10 15:41:23 k
creations-chat 2022-01-10 15:44:31 so the thing is my plane too smol i cant add text that fit XD
general 2022-01-10 19:11:26 meh bored anyone have something simple for me too make
creations-chat 2022-01-10 20:30:41 another argument XD
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:44:03 i would say maybe if u moved the super sturcture back u can add a bigger gun but i mean for now it looks fine. but my brain refuses to say it looks fine. it says move the superstructure back.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:46:21 that looks very much like a panzer 1 without the turret
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:57:28 one. make the front part longer if possible. two add a gun if possible. three add some detail to the super stucture but other than that it looks nice
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:05:34 like radars. or even range finders
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:08:25 thats nice.
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:06:12 ah thats nice
creations-chat 2022-01-14 20:25:32 if the cannon is smaller and move back abit it would look even nicer
creations-chat 2022-01-17 00:24:11 i will say it looks cool but i dont know what other people may say about it
creations-chat 2022-01-17 00:26:28 i know what they look like sooo.. it does look like f4 nose but if longer definatly could look like mig
creations-chat 2022-01-19 01:05:02 could be longer. donesnt need spine to curve down. looks nice
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:53:48 noice

help 2022-02-05 23:42:16 by not using hover engines
help 2022-02-05 23:51:28 wings so that when lifting up it doesnt tip as much as it should. helium to make the ship lighter and balanced. thrusters that move it. it will be hard to use as it would have more controls that a hover vehilce
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:48:26 hmmmmmmmm wat if the add a Fu4 cosiar XD
events-chat 2022-02-07 16:48:42 f4u cosair

creations-chat 2022-02-10 19:36:44 i would suggest stop wasting brain cells and just talk normally people
creations-chat 2022-02-10 19:44:30 can i see it unspawned even tho i might not have a great solution
creations-chat 2022-02-10 19:49:13 um. i would say remove the wheels. move it to one of the higher places. and connect the wheels. if its still one block high or half block high make a motor lock to fit it.
creations-chat 2022-02-11 14:19:56 i would say it does look ok. but the canopy is meh. even tho im not great at making canopys
creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:23:12 use metal or anything that isnt foil.
creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:46:25 i dunno how ur gona smooth out the edges
creations-chat 2022-02-11 16:42:42 how long ur ship take to make cause thats one cool ship
creations-chat 2022-02-11 18:49:58 motor locked into each other from what it seems.
creations-chat 2022-02-11 21:58:45 inside looks good. u can add glow for after burners. the inside lining could be changed to diff material.
creations-chat 2022-02-11 23:01:21 those look like different variants of the same plane
creations-chat 2022-02-11 23:05:29 soooooooo. is that supposed to be a mass produced planes. cause i see its french but its not a mirage. and looks like and f4 phatnom in a way
creations-chat 2022-02-11 23:26:48 noice, i already made one custom stealth fighter, i havent posted it only because its a bit bland on the extrouir
creations-chat 2022-02-11 23:35:04 for a b17 i would say yes
creations-chat 2022-02-11 23:41:00 i think that desination is taken. the YF-23. NVM SRY.
creations-chat 2022-02-12 00:01:34 make front longer ish
creations-chat 2022-02-12 00:51:18 i think the F-16 has a two looking intake
creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:29:00 u sayj j-20 right. cause their is no j-22. but do the drakens cranked arrow
creations-chat 2022-02-14 15:51:29 if draken wing doesnt work for ur plane. do a normal f-22
creations-chat 2022-02-14 22:23:32 noice
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:26:12 the wing pointing down might cause problems to radar cross section so it might make it less stealthy but i dunno if it actually affects planes in real life.
creations-chat 2022-02-15 00:51:43 maybe. remove
creations-chat 2022-02-15 01:10:31 cool. maybe remove that dome and make it not look like phalanx, and add a big rear thingy
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:18:24 looks big
creations-chat 2022-02-16 00:48:09 i think the nose doesnt block that much. the airflow will be more wild if the drone is going faster. the surface airflow will be faster. unless the engineers have thought of how to use the surface airflow or whatever it called. thats a problem. but other than that if its slow and airflow isnt as wild than thats an ok intake placement
events-chat 2022-02-16 15:12:50 im trying to understand what hes saying but what the hail is he saying
creations-chat 2022-02-16 23:27:53 um, lets say. F_14 camo
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:26:48 ummmmmmmm. why nose so round, also why intake so small?
creations-chat 2022-02-17 00:40:02 dammmm. thats well thought out
creations-chat 2022-02-17 17:58:51 how in the world do u look at a plane and say china
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:00:54 so what. doesnt mean u can call it china. and u didnt even say it correct. its a chinese jet. and why ew china.
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:03:23 it's a Chinese jet. not China. so I'm correcting your mistake
creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:06:19 that's fair. üôÇ
creations-chat 2022-02-17 22:41:40 definatly could get so more work
creations-chat 2022-02-17 23:44:53 arent you a white name?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:41:56 maybe a 0.2 off ground will be great
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:44:01 like use pistom and piston lock 0.2 off ground. but ye something like that
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:54:13 your welcome. üôÇ
creations-chat 2022-02-18 19:14:23 um the upper jaw shouldnt have a bump
creations-chat 2022-02-18 19:41:32 in a way yes
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:16:38 thats one of the coolest planes i have ever seen. NOICE BRO, but if ur looking for the cuul. add internal weapons bay
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:19:10 me: has plane with internal weapons bay. Its not laggy
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:21:19 ok well. good luck though. üôÇ
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:24:09 dammm bro. how long it take
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:26:14 nice. i made a stealth jet but its definatly not as cool as yours. but i mean its different. and its more of a 6th gen. and it has less colors. but i have internal weapons bay
creations-chat 2022-02-18 20:29:26 cant i just say that i have a weapons bay?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:31:18 what color should i make tis
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:33:16 why? its a jet. even though it looks a bit crappy. its still good
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:35:58 tried making 6th gen. but it seems like the cockpit area is poking up alot.
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:38:17 so what kind o jet color should i do. any suggestions
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:40:38 dark greys? like night fighter or something
creations-chat 2022-02-18 22:58:25 soo. is this too dark
creations-chat 2022-02-18 23:17:02 ill see if i can fix
creations-chat 2022-02-18 23:35:32 im bad at taking pics. and thats why i said it feels to tall
creations-chat 2022-02-18 23:37:34 what kind do i need. bruh
creations-chat 2022-02-19 01:24:39 lots of dusk around tank. less dust around the diroma. mostly near the broken down vehicles
events-chat 2022-02-23 20:26:39 what would happen if i have a undersized airship
events-chat 2022-02-23 20:28:12 is undersized airships ok
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:01:39 is undersized airships ok
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:35:33 o. but ill be bigger target and i know i wont be much of a fight. maybe ill armor more
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:24:59 i made my airship go more than 150. just by making my props different. :l
creations-chat 2022-02-24 17:37:28 how do u make intakes angled
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:47:35 k
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:50:20 i cant find screenshott
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:51:10 no?
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:51:27 where tat.
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:53:43 
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:54:12 it a twin prop. spins opposite. and can go up to 154
events-chat 2022-02-24 17:54:37 see
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:09:32 hmm. yes it does seem very blocky
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:17:34 weeeellllll. not really. im using custom props on a airship. and it only goes 154
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:21:00 use one big custom motor. stack afew motors at max torque and speed.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:24:54 customs work underwater if u have enough torque to keep prop spinning
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:26:57 u already have a creation that can break my laptop. custom props wont harm or else my laptop would have OOFED way earlier.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 18:32:07 dammmm. nice
events-chat 2022-02-24 19:43:50 am i the only kind of airship with a gas bag as body
events-chat 2022-02-24 19:47:46 well i have a gasbag as body but its armored
events-chat 2022-02-24 19:59:17 i have side gas bags AND a body gas bag
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:16:24 it never reaches 150 ever.
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:16:54 its always like 120 when im not going fowards
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:20:12 time to slow down my ship. :l
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:23:38 ok fixed the speed
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:23:57 now goes 125.
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:24:34 which is sad because missle would hit me more. so i added flares which im 100% sure wont have any impact on survivability
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:25:05 can i add a biplane.
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:42:37 when the event
events-chat 2022-02-24 20:44:21 oof

creations-chat 2022-03-02 00:12:06 i wish i had that skill at building. üò¶
creations-chat 2022-03-02 00:17:48 im stuck at this skill rate right now. im not THAAAAAAT good. he uses piston lock. loads of angle locks. i dont think i can do that much angle locks.
creations-chat 2022-03-02 00:20:45 did u plan all that out. cause i cant plan stuff
creations-chat 2022-03-02 00:23:23 yes i understand how motor lock works. but do u want to see my only good build that i messed up on because i couldnt think of how to motor lock ir
contest-chat 2022-03-10 22:53:07 i somehow think i know what u made. but i could be wrong. is it the little willy.
events-chat 2022-03-23 20:03:50 why so much spaceships not airships...
creations-chat 2022-03-29 23:26:42 maybe if u add wheels on the side. u can add door in between
creations-chat 2022-03-29 23:35:42 yes
creations-chat 2022-03-31 22:19:49 eh toasted steak i see u getting into the aviation stuff. noice. i dont know if u did cause i never saw any of ur planes
creations-chat 2022-03-31 22:25:22 o hey ad
creations-chat 2022-03-31 22:40:55 what plane is that
creations-chat 2022-03-31 22:44:18 i would say the left one but if left wing was bigger then its way better.
creations-chat 2022-03-31 22:54:55 move back abit. MAYBE make the angle bit noticable. but it looks fine
creations-chat 2022-04-28 02:56:12 Which boat?
creations-chat 2022-04-28 02:57:57 That‚Äôs my friend carrier. Im just a small landing craft.
creations-chat 2022-04-28 03:01:19 I wasn‚Äôt showing of my build.
events-chat 2022-05-06 00:19:13 are there more battlebots
bug-reports 2022-10-18 22:29:25 the signs in game arent working the same way or shall i say bugged because even when i dont edit it it still gets selected and stuff
creations-chat 2022-10-18 23:39:39 is anyone able to make a tiny AA gun that looks good. doesnt have to be functional just small
creations-chat 2022-10-19 20:55:34 i am curious what your jets look like. cause dam then names are very detailed unlike me. i just write plane, car, tank, blah blah blah
creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:09:51 I had one o those
creations-chat 2022-10-19 23:19:19 just as im starting my A6M. you guys are talking about japanese planes
creations-chat 2022-10-19 23:34:03 the person above must be a gigachad to be in sucha a cool jet
creations-chat 2022-10-20 19:56:23 anyone got a reliable A6M zero blueprint. i also dunno what variant i wanna do.
creations-chat 2022-10-20 20:02:09 well i guess im using it already. but my brain cant comprehend these blueprints
creations-chat 2022-10-20 22:56:55 may i suggest a smaller turret, although the disconetter as ERA armor or as detail on front is certainly intresting
contest-chat 2022-11-23 23:16:26 you got a point
contest-chat 2022-11-23 23:16:42 but i think it would actually work
contest-chat 2022-11-23 23:18:18 but it would YES be expensive furing development
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:03:19 1940 raf camo. üëç will do
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:07:56 A ww2 bomber fighter. As heavy as you can make it look. Like P-47 but with your own style in it
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:10:24 A fighter bomber I meant. Sorry. But like a heavy fighter that carry a few bombs but not a lot. Like the F4U Corsair
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:33:20 Why?
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:37:52 But flying em becomes harder right cause extra lift on top?
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:41:24 Not sluggish?
creations-chat 2022-11-24 00:45:52 Well my custom plane is getting loads of down votes
