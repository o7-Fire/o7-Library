plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:27:00 since my average is 15 secs
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:28:30 you should average about a minute with a rubiks brand
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:28:40 if you use the beginners method
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:29:09 oh try using roux method
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:29:16 then learn cfop after
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:29:59 winter variation is a good place to go then
plane-crazy 2019-10-30 03:31:32 so i think you should wait until the new gan cube comes out

general 2020-05-23 18:02:19 Piggles360Today at 6:40 PM
Username: StrikerProGamer88
Reason: Incredible annoyance, refusing to stop, speaking in other languages, death threats, clearly not mature
Evidence: https://streamable.com/n3jxal (this is only some of the evidence, the rest was lost to chat. it was in vip1, there are other people that saw the same stuff.)
striker is in fact in this discord server
general 2020-05-23 18:03:05 the dude was discriminating against him

plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:18:43 hmm and you decide to make the exact same mechanism and make it a hover trike?
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:19:53 alright let's look at his design vs mine
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:20:57 
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:21:05 
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:21:35 i don't copyright mechanisms
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:21:45 but if i see something this similar i get suspicious
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:23:14 i showed a few ppl how to make it
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:23:28 that's about it
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:24:47 which mega
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:25:04 i might have showed one of them
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:27:22 That’s different use case
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:27:55 But when something looks oddly similar it’s really hard to believe that they made it themself
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:28:52 I think I might have left it sitting in vip1 for way too long
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:30:43 I got friends with full on plot sized mechs copied and made tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:31:10 I have no idea
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:31:33 Carlomigs and kxssidy are the guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:32:00 And Carlos mechs aren’t like even normal mechs
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:32:28 They use such minuscule amounts of helium
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:32:40 And no thrust
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:32:56 So idek how the hell you copy it
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:34:06 Ppl are probably just rebels
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 01:35:07 Big bruh

general 2020-06-24 04:51:54 I think the point of the turret is to aim
general 2020-06-24 04:52:17 I don’t think the turret can aim with that massive ding ding

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:16:21 I made 1 way glass out of boredom
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:16:51 Idk if I can get a clear pic
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:16:54 But
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:17:00 Basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:17:14 It’s a ton of stacked legacy glass
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:17:29 To make an opaque glass block
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:17:46 Then a glass block behind that bc glass blocks do weird things
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:18:35 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:18:52 I did like 8 layers
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:19:00 It seemed to work alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:20:01 I’ll make a one way glass wall tmr
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:20:38 Smoke painted orange with orange light
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:21:22 Mm then all that cool fire motor lock stuff is useless
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:22:41 Just build it out of blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:23:17 Yes I did that
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:23:23 But with half balls
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:23:56 Bc I needed half ball shape for outside of hyper speed space craft
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:24:21 Make one
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:24:29 I’m sure it’s possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:25:01 Oh wait I just realized that that wasn’t a plane crazy screenshot
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:27:06 Of course it’s sak
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:27:42 Sak made working video
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:28:33 Why is it that adding more blocks to my creation makes it faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:29:26 Like I used to fly at 3.3k
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:29:47 Now I’m flying at 5.5k after adding side flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:29:57 Speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:30:18 3.3k is my space crafts cruising speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:30:37 After I added extra flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:30:48 It went up to 5.5k
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:31:17 <#623337136267067393>
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:32:29 does that mean I can build realistic moving girl physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:32:49 Yeah not doing that
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:37:17 “It’s just a wakandan flag”
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:37:47 Why can’t it be American poop?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:37:54 Or Chinese poop?
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:39:06 Why plane crazy physics be like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:39:33 My previous average cruising flying speed was 3.3k speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:39:50 Now it is at 6k after adding 200 blocks

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:43:05 Our mech community isn’t large enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:44:32 I like the last 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:44:49 “Muted bc he asked for it”
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:45:04 “Muted bc he’s too cool”
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:47:05 Hmm why when you add more blocks conveyer engine make aircraft go faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:47:29 Bare bones my aircraft can get up tp 1.3k
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:47:43 Armored it gets up to 3.3k
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:47:59 Weaponized it gets up to 5.5k
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:48:20 Try it on a smaller one
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:48:33 You will go like bullet
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:49:17 Oh my space craft gets better stability the faster it goes
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:49:42 And it goes hella fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:49:54 Idk man
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:50:14 I have more maneuverability the faster I go
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:50:28 It also gets more stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:50:45 Like as soon as I slow down I lose stability
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 04:50:56 So I really can’t land

plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:20:33 i feel like contests are a bit biased
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:21:06 they should make it so that submitting a creation is anonymous
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:21:15 so it's not a popularity contest
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:21:39 only the mods know who submitted what
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:21:53 that's what contests should be
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:22:05 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:22:23 still going to be very biased
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:22:37 since you can't control in game interactions
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:23:17 i guess i made a dog before
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:23:51 i mean that's sort of a good thing because he would have won his own contest
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:28:01 make it so that only pic of creation shows
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:28:06 no name of creator
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 16:28:13 creates large bias

plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:16:39 The cutters on it seem to do nothing
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:17:26 No
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:17:46 I’m saying there’s a bug where cutters don’t work if you have an anchor on your creation

plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:17:59 I’m not a degenerate
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:18:44 Problem with that is the mechanism relies on no physics
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 02:19:24 Maybe I’ll try doubling up on anchors because that seems to weirdly work

the-dump 2021-03-16 05:28:05 
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 06:32:14 In about 14 hrs post it
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 06:33:36 For a good amount of upvotes it either has to be built by someone popular, be a meme, or be something big
the-dump 2021-04-05 00:15:26 Morally what is the right solution here
the-dump 2021-04-05 00:15:56

general 2021-07-20 17:02:45 I heard this heepla kid was shitting on ghiora
general 2021-07-20 17:03:09 And asking why everyone hates him
general 2021-07-20 17:03:59 
general 2021-07-20 17:05:32 But this little shit was hyping up a mech battle saying he was gonna win
general 2021-07-20 17:05:50 And he “forgot to turn on pvp”
general 2021-07-20 17:06:01 And still lost with pvp off
general 2021-07-20 17:06:55 He got teeter off the map
general 2021-07-20 17:07:35 6k block thing throwing another 6k block thing off the map
general 2021-07-20 17:09:45 No he just got thrown off 1 swing
general 2021-07-20 17:10:21 Usually yes
general 2021-07-20 17:10:49 Either flying full speed at each other
general 2021-07-20 17:10:58 Or swinging arms aimlessly
general 2021-07-20 17:11:35 It would be very uncool looking if it were in like a movie
general 2021-07-20 17:11:52 Like imagine pacific rim
general 2021-07-20 17:12:00 With plane crazy mechs
general 2021-07-20 17:12:36 Like that would be so uncool
general 2021-07-26 03:56:06 as a separate item i think the fixed locked motors could be cool

general 2021-07-29 21:13:44 Probably is
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:26:31 
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:32:43 
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:13 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:33:23 Not sure where I’m going with it yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:41:11 How much motor lock do you want
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:41:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:42:32 I like the stray suspension pieces
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 02:42:37 Adds a nice touch
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 18:54:45 
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 18:59:02 I just had this convo in game
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 19:00:07 Idk if you can have a good aesthetic while having really good functionality in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 19:01:52 You read the rules
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 19:43:43 I feel like it would look weird without them
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 22:28:20 
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 04:35:40

plane-crazy 2021-07-31 07:53:14 
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 07:54:16 I kinda just wanted to build muscles
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 07:57:42 Tutorial = big views = subscribe
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 07:57:51 It’s all a ploy for the views
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 07:58:00 I cracked the case
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:00:34 Yeah one of my friends needed help making an oni mask
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:00:48 But mine turned out too big for them so I just used it
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:03:04 Can remove the word ship
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:03:27 All plane crazy combat is something similar
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:05:05 Or just all at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:07:14 Uwu pulls uwu out glock owo
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:09:16 You good?
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:09:22 What do you need wiki for?
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:11:23 Not really any use for a plane crazy wiki
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 08:11:49 They already tell you all the event items and what they do when you log in during an event
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:40:59 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:41:06 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:45:25 Was gonna do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:45:53 You do notice the role “expert robotics specialist v”
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:46:04 Didn’t come from nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:48:35 100 push-ups
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:48:41 100 squats
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:48:46 100 sit-ups
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:48:52 And 10 kilometers every day
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:00:03 all you gotta do is make the build really good from 1 angle and you dont need a video
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:00:13 other angles dont matter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:00:17 just 1 angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:01:19 my first post on this server got me designer v and robotics expert v oddly enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:02:24 my build wasnt iven that good
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:02:45 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:04:17 i think the video of it shooting tnt balls carried it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:05:00 idk man my builds werent that good back then
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:05:04 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:05:11 3 plot tall mech i guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:05:45 video not necessary
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:07:13 i mean i got 90 upvotes on a wip image
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 05:07:16

general 2021-08-07 03:04:47 No they have a slight twist
general 2021-08-07 03:05:25 Those stairs are diagonal
general 2021-08-07 03:05:44 We only have straight on stairs
general 2021-08-07 03:06:10 When was this update
general 2021-08-07 03:06:16 Probably missed it
general 2021-08-07 03:06:30 Since I don’t use stairs
general 2021-08-07 03:07:22 I’ll take your entire stock if it’s a motor pet
general 2021-08-07 03:09:55 I think I wasn’t playing during that update
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:54:54 Why didn’t you use the speaker part
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:55:05 Could have real sound
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 04:16:35 
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 04:17:10 I tried to make the seams as small as I could

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 03:49:25 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 06:57:42 whats the point of that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:02:52 so i finished a remake of a 2 year old creation
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:03:08 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:06:12 I think that’s an issue on your end because I rendered it in 800px
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:23:54 The og creation was not that pog
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:24:07 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:24:42 Old one’s animation was chaotic
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:24:53 It wasn’t as controlled
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:05:55 If I made hatsune miku how many upvotes do you think it will get
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:06:20 Cool cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:06:34 Wanna break the record for least upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-08-23 04:11:59 There’s no video from 3 years ago but it looked like crap, I do have an image
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:13:32 Damn bro that’s gonna be tough
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:13:48 I don’t think hatsune miku is gonna break that record
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:14:15 This surviving as a white name in pcc challenge is going pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:17:14 i still haven't gotten cucked for being white name
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:17:23 i thought i was supposed to get cucked
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:18:17 btw how to get in hof now
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:18:29 its like impossible bruv
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:18:35 very biased
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:19:29 yeah it is but its all up to the moderators to choose
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:19:38 thats the only issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:19:54 its not up to the public to decide who gets in hof
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:20:18 like i bet if i posted this it wouldn't get it
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:20:54 the paint is whats making the muscles pop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:21:07 dude if you scroll up
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:21:12 theres a train
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:21:19 and it does not deserve to be in there
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:21:41 no the staff votes on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:22:04 and its usually very biased against land vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:22:48 last time i believe a mech got in to hof is waluigi
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:24:38 you know i tried to submit keanu reeves into hall of fame and it was denied for being a meme
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:24:59 and fucking waluigi comes in 1 year later and gets in
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:25:48 idk i mean like humanoid
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:25:54 i am very sorry
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:25:58 for cursing at someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:26:15 since a lot of the sea animals seem to be getting into hof
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:26:46 i was lucky to get designer v when the requirements were 20 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 04:27:51 interesting

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 07:40:54 I mean I could go for expert supreme
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 07:41:02 It can’t be that difficult right

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:15:12 There’s a block limit?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:15:20 I thought it was just a data limit
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:15:36 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:16:10 multiple accounts = more space

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:17:02 I don’t think it moved
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:17:08 Probably just anchored
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:17:39 It was a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:17:47 Lemme see if I can find it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:18:21 It closes client doesn’t it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:18:53 Yeah you have to use the multiple client enabler thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:19:04 Which is probably considered an exploit
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:19:45 Wait luny why do you only have designer 1 but robotics v
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:20:05 I think you can submit the same build for different roles though right
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:22:53 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:22:59 I guess it’s harder now
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:23:28 I got all mine when the reqs were like 20
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:24:49 Idk depends what you have
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:25:19 Oh crap I should submit to hof
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:26:56 
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:27:04 I didn’t expect it to get this much
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:27:38 It’s only like 800 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:34:21 If I can get more plot space I might be able to fit a ring on the back
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:35:02 Vah ruta?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:36:38 Motor lock can fix anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:37:13 Wait it’s still the same?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:37:38 I thought it was more upvotes for robotics v
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:38:16 I guess the standards are a lot higher
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:38:36 Because I got designer v and robotics v for my first creation
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:38:48 That I submitted
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:38:57 Not my first ever creation
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:39:23 What did you submit
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:39:50 Or what are you planning to submit
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:40:05 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:40:42 The horse including the rider is around 2.1k blocks so I think I can do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:40:58 Looking a little sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:42:15 Congrats if you can replicate all the details
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:42:30 Extra credit if you make the puzzle inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:43:02 Interior is what’s gonna push it through hall of fame
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:47:17 Can we get a sneak peek?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:47:22 Or maybe in dms
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:47:39 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:48:43 Nah I think motor locking is probably the best way
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:49:33 I think you can motor lock it in place
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:51:30 If you learn motor lock you can just laterally lock it in place without needing to fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:52:10 Maybe you can combine motor lock with folding
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:52:26 It is very gay
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:52:32 Would not recommend
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:55:23 No height limit kinda makes large builds less impressive
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:57:23 Infinite height means someone can recreate the entire map because no restrictions
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 06:57:43 Can cause quite a few problems
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:00:02 Not actual infinite
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:00:19 The terrain is random
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:03:52 Yes unless it’s a third party server
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 03:56:33 
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 03:58:31 ik i took the pic as fast as i could

plane-crazy 2021-08-26 05:48:57 That moment when
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 14:10:04 Gotta get the angle you know
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 01:55:29 win pose?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:20:39 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:20:49 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:23:24 im happy with the poseability
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:51:07 what weapon to give
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 03:51:21 yes good idea lawnmower

plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:19:34 he just got a role rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:20:09 back in my day i pinged a mod and got a role
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:20:37 back in my day you were the one that gave me designer v
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:21:10 or was it hyperbit
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:21:41 yes i joined late
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:21:57 i didnt figure out about the discord server until 2 years into the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:23:01 you built a car so cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:23:28 wait whats the reqs for land vehicle expert now
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:24:02 ah its still 20 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:24:16 i thought they would add more
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:25:22 i am still trying to get master robotics X but i think the people voting on hof have some bias against mechs or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:27:09 i mean this is what im currently working on
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:27:18 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:27:45 build something really small then
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:28:32 idk man my friend got like 120 upvotes with this
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:29:28 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:29:40 its really not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:30:04 idk if animal is the way
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:30:35 bird would get you aeronautical engineer
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:30:50 hes aiming for robotics engineer
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:34:18 why being so mean to white name
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:34:49 building big doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:34:57 building with a lot of blocks is what matters
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:35:28 motorlock the jet on top of itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:35:39 like rebuild it and motor lock it into itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:36:24 its not unnecessary
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:36:28 its armor for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:36:30 B)
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:37:13 against cutters i noticed a pretty good increase in durability
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 06:37:17 against guns gg
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 22:53:58 experimenting with positionable hand
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 23:03:24 i dont think it needs to have much movement so i just made it able to point and make a fist
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 23:09:03 
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 23:23:27 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 05:23:43

plane-crazy 2021-08-30 00:40:02 el monke
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 00:50:04 its the only way i could fit it in the plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 00:50:18 they pretty much touch the edges in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 00:53:07 not exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 00:53:13 i can just undo some of the motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:05:56 
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:10:34 he is
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:21:34 its not perfect, feudal japan clothing with a futuristic katana
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 23:10:57

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:20:50

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 06:08:34 yeah i can kinda tell that they are the right proportions but that head looks massive

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:30:54 
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:31:19 trying to make a 1:1 scale legion from titanfall
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:08:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:41:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:42:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:43:25 i just really wanted to redo legion
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:43:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:43:52 the old one is so ass
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:43:55 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:46:28 i think legion is like 15-17 blocks tall in game
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:46:34 haven't measured it
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:47:00 getting something that small into hall of fame would be pretty poggur
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:49:20 legion
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:50:03 whats wrong with speakers
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 18:50:32 ah i see why you dont like speakers
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 19:42:44 bunch of friends and i are making titans, the only ones left are the original chassis
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 19:43:40 ogre, reaper, and atlas
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:25:16 heres a comparison between the old and new version
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 21:29:30 new one also has an opening hatch
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:07:35 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:09:16 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:20:59 hes not joking
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:21:23 all hes ever posted was stupid spongebob popsicle and that
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:22:09 i mean he did thomas the tank engine a week ago
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:23:10 remember there has to be no helium so it can't fit both boat and rocket
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:23:38 all the other ones are easy but you have to choose between 3 stage rocket and boat
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:24:24 i guess that could work if you have it really heavy
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:24:44 for robotics its better to have multiple legs so you dont have to worry about the helium
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:25:22 that could work actually
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:25:48 the vehicles have to have no helium in them though so can't have like a mech in one of them
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:27:20 yes hes a dingus
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:28:02 whats wrong with motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 23:28:17 it makes it not funny if you elaborate
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 01:34:27 not rushed

creations-chat 2021-11-24 00:52:25 it was based off of the video but i made mine out of disconnectors his rig was way smaller and had a larger character
creations-chat 2021-11-24 00:55:57 this one was the tutorial one that i based mine off of, its a lot bigger. i'm not claiming the concept as my own but i'm saying i made a smaller version

events-chat 2022-05-08 20:12:50 i just want to see that thing fight
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:13:23 oh wait it is on the wheel
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:32:47 damn but moist pony is like really op
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:33:51 if nobody wants it can i just take it
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:41:15 cool
events-chat 2022-05-08 20:54:21 if they don't want to build it will they get a third reroll?
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 22:00:15 
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 23:00:51 i am not
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 23:01:54 i just built it for fun
plane-crazy 2022-05-08 23:04:52 was originally gonna design the legs for minty but she didn't want the automatic legs
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 01:21:51 
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 14:55:13 I don’t feel like painting it
events-chat 2022-05-09 15:52:09 To be accurate it would have to be comically small but it has 3 spinners
events-chat 2022-05-09 15:52:27 Which is why I want it
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 18:38:30 golden rays of the glorious sunshine setting down such blood red light as the animals slowly retreat from the shadows out of sight
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 19:07:46 its not that hard
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 19:07:59 you just have to make a somewhat spherical shape
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 19:09:51 ive made some seamless joints
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 19:09:58 never tried them on knees
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 19:10:03 it might work
events-chat 2022-05-10 05:41:46 if you don't get anything back from moist pony i'll take rusty

general 2022-05-14 06:48:26 ?
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:11:02 <@466793357318815744> im down to do a chomp vs chomp at the end
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:43:26 is there a server link?
events-chat 2022-05-15 16:53:13 yeah i touched him barely and it flung me across the map
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:22:20 bigger battlebots in the show should have larger size in the event
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:22:37 because if huge was comically small he can't do anything
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:25:36 yeah depends on what bot
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:26:25 like huge relies on bots being able to fit between his wheels to do dmg, there was a bot that added an extension to make themselves bigger in the actual show and won because it had control over the fight
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:41:42 i mean he said to make them as similar to the real bots as possible
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:42:43 i mean theres no other way to get back in the arena for some of the lore accurate bots
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:43:37 ok thats pretty bs
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:44:37 i mean their matchups werent the best
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:45:13 they put a spinner bot against another spinner bot (both have 360 range) and a flipper bot against another flipper bot (both do like no dmg)
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:46:11 yeah thats the bs part
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:51:34 i mean cheating should be disqualified right?
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:35 i mean he did organize the event
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:51 and still lost
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:50 yeah probably
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:54:09 most people cheated im pretty sure unintentionally or intentionally
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:48 i mean it was approved by the host and chomp did get a few liberties for being a walker
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:07 even though it ended up being on wheels
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:59:14 if it was a walker i'd understand the bonuses
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:00:07 that one is a weird one
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:00:32 like my version's walking mechanism probably would get one shot
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:02:35 its a tough call to say what should get a bonus and what shouldnt
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:20:25 thats just robloc physics
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:04 pcc drama 😳

events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:17 ah yes the classic way to solve youtube drama
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:40 irl boxing match (for charity of course)
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:39:59 minty is woman B)
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:40:42 ah yes ranges from 15-18
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:40:58 similar age range
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:35 that was pretty deserved win
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:42:10 so about that chomp vs chomp match minty....
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:08 there should be a scoring system like: how much dmg to each bot
who controlled the match
who was more aggressive
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:26 most points should have been for dmg
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:45:31 NO this is VERY important you wouldn't understand
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 03:15:20 i made bol joint
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 04:04:50 ?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 05:41:38 i made it with no exposed motors and even thinner connection points

general 2023-06-30 20:04:27 loving the new pc2 development ☠️
general 2023-06-30 20:05:04 i've been waiting 2 years and we get a hat
general 2023-06-30 20:05:19 nah i'm not even waiting anymore
general 2023-06-30 20:05:21 i moved on
general 2023-06-30 20:05:32 its almost 3
general 2023-06-30 20:07:21 what i mentioned other building games
general 2023-06-30 20:07:29 and it told me to watch my language
general 2023-06-30 20:07:41 flightpoint?
general 2023-06-30 20:08:11 nah they just mad because the logic is decent
general 2023-06-30 20:08:19 building is kinda shit though
general 2023-06-30 20:09:21 i mean at least one of the devs is working on the game
general 2023-06-30 20:10:00 how many people does he even have on the team
general 2023-06-30 20:10:16 it was supposed to come out 2 years ago
general 2023-06-30 20:10:20 during summer
general 2023-06-30 20:10:48 flightpoint is better than what i've seen from pc2 leaks
general 2023-06-30 20:11:26 kinda
general 2023-06-30 20:11:32 i think elite engineering is mroe like blender
general 2023-06-30 20:11:45 but elite engineering is branching more off of the bym genre
general 2023-06-30 20:13:15 flightpoint is plane crazy with scaling tool and triangle tool
general 2023-06-30 20:13:28 and that's pretty much all the changes
general 2023-06-30 20:13:36 youre right
general 2023-06-30 20:13:46 i haven't lagged at all playing flight point
general 2023-06-30 20:14:11 no but you know what we are getting?
general 2023-06-30 20:14:16 a hat that took 3 years to make
general 2023-06-30 20:14:45 no because here we are in plane crazy general
general 2023-06-30 20:15:22 that is absolutely cap no bitches play plane crazy
general 2023-06-30 20:15:46 shii youre right
general 2023-06-30 20:16:17 no no i don't wanna wait another 3 years for the disconnector hat to come out
general 2023-06-30 20:17:26 oh shit
general 2023-06-30 20:18:14 camera hat
general 2023-06-30 20:18:35 2019 egg event:
general 2023-06-30 20:20:50 idk bro nowadays i've been playing flightpoint and elite engineering
general 2023-06-30 20:21:09 elite engineering has everything besides user friendliness
general 2023-07-07 15:27:20 bro what is that helmet model

general 2023-07-07 15:30:08 incredible
general 2023-07-07 15:31:09 ong they are
general 2023-07-07 15:32:46 idk if i'm even coming back to pc
general 2023-07-07 15:32:55 this game kinda dookie
general 2023-07-07 15:33:29 nah i started playing elite engineers and it had a lot more potential
general 2023-07-07 15:34:53 i mean pc is the most intuitive i guess
general 2023-07-07 15:35:16 yeah you cant push it much
general 2023-07-07 15:35:57 so i'm trying to uh figure out inverse kinematics in ee
general 2023-07-07 15:36:32 i stayed up really late and saw all the korean mechs
general 2023-07-07 15:36:38 somewhat
general 2023-07-07 15:36:44 its mostly math
general 2023-07-07 15:38:42 basically i'm trying to find the green angle given where the blue points are and the legnth of the red segments
general 2023-07-07 15:39:05 but the formula i'm using doesnt really work too well
general 2023-07-07 15:40:01 the coordinates of the blue points and the length of the red points
general 2023-07-07 15:40:10 rn i'm just using law of cosines to find everything
general 2023-07-07 15:40:52 location of the bottom blue point is -6,-20 location of the top one is 0,0
general 2023-07-07 15:41:01 length of both the red segments are 14
general 2023-07-07 15:41:10 i'm trying to make it expandable though
general 2023-07-07 15:42:49 so far i've basically gotten the position of the yellow angle i just need the green one to hit the bottom blue point
general 2023-07-07 15:43:01 i mean its not a math question
general 2023-07-07 15:43:07 i'm tyring to build something in game
general 2023-07-07 15:43:43 its an extension of the red line
general 2023-07-07 15:45:19 yeah that's what ive been trying to do but it doesnt work with law of cosines in game
general 2023-07-07 15:45:36 https://gyazo.com/57b6a400b049e913db139edbd84cc79e.gif
general 2023-07-07 15:45:44 this is basically what i'm trying to achieve
general 2023-07-07 15:46:03 right now they are
general 2023-07-07 15:46:17 i don't wanna simplify the equation so i can change the length when i need to though
general 2023-07-07 15:47:50 i was just wondering if there was a different method
general 2023-07-07 15:48:08 because i can find the hip area with vectors
general 2023-07-07 15:48:26 but plugging in the rest doesnt really give good results
general 2023-07-07 15:48:57 maybe i wired up the logic wrong
general 2023-07-07 15:48:58 idk
general 2023-07-07 15:50:59 i'm using inverse cosine to find the blue angle
general 2023-07-07 15:51:03 arccos
general 2023-07-07 15:51:42 i can kinda skip that step because theres vector blocks
general 2023-07-07 15:51:59 i can set a point and find the magnitude between them
general 2023-07-07 15:52:08 basically condenses the math
