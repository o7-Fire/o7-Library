bug-reports 2021-11-14 13:48:36 Motor 2 on mobile. Whenever you press a control button, the motor 2 will face the direction of the button you pressed. It makes turrets with things like lava shooters and rockets worthless, as you cannot aim where they shoot. (Idea to fix: make control buttons a blind spot for it, basically its a space where nothing will happen if you click it other than the control button being pressed)
bug-reports 2021-11-14 13:49:49 yeah but on pc it doesnt snap to ur keyboard keys when you press them
