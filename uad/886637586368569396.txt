plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:50:06 i mean TNT is strongest armor in game
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:50:44 head cutters? i think the weak point is head
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:21 hmm nice i think
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:30 is its fast?
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:35 then faster then better

plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:15:36 guys, i wanna present to you:anti shredder turret V 1.0, made specifically to fight shredders
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:16:23 what? wdym
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:17:29 i just was fighting shredders with my turret, it uses motors 2 so i can point an shredder and shoot it, nothing broke
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:20:30 ahh ok, also what you think of anti-shredder turret i made?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 05:25:29 anti-shredder turret V:1.0, made specifically to fight shredders, posted it here because i think its too simple for <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:36:24 well, its works well against shredders, its main thing, i don't care about how it looks
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:38:16 im not sure if i have enough TNT, but i'll try
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:46:54 while i made attempt to make it better i got problem, while testing it somewhy stopped turning up
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:47:16 and you know, when i need to fight against things like shredders, i just NEED to aim up
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:47:37 note: its motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:48:38 yess, the bottom part is anochored but with physics
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:48:50 ah ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:51:37 i don't think blocks can connect like that
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:53:51 down there another mottor 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:53:55 so it can rotate
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:56:17 figured it out
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 05:58:12 ok i have V2 but don't have shredders to test, ill test on planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:00:45 figured out some more problems, for example: upper motor not protected enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:49:05 guys, those tnt's are most powerful weapon i seen in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:49:28 
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:53:13 what those TNT'S do:
1: go up in sky by themselfs
2: go to someone THOUGHT EVERYTHING (like even thought walls and roof of innovation inc facility and almost thought blacklist barrier)
3: magnets to target and then explodes, no matter what target is, it always comes right to it
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:53:33 the guy who made it calls it "orbital strike"
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:54:39 like blacklist barrier only thing that could stop it, though i could see some TNT'S inside my plot, but they were gone second after i seen them
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:55:02 its most powerful thing i seen yet in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:56:37 he added cutters to that powerful machine .-.
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 06:56:46 now i seen everything
general 2023-04-04 07:00:01 guys can anyone explain thing i saw in plane crazy? (image and description in <#384021699466756107>)
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:02:23 same reaction
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:03:11 nickname of guy who made this
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:03:50 hi
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:34:51 he will just orbital strike you probably
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:34:55 so its kinda usseles
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:36:08 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:36:35 i couldn't record this thing on video
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 07:37:28 he has reason
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:50:21 fix when
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:51:20 guys imagines if madattak come back to PC lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:52:16 so, guys imagine if madattak actually comes back to PC development lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:53:07 i wonder why madattak left PC development
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:54:10 guys what will come first: half life 3 or innovation inc mars base
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:54:52 what is pcc? i always thought its plane crazy community but i saw "pcc community" in one plane crazy meme
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:56:51 guys what you think will come before: innovation inc mars base, OR plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:57:05 ah yeah.... mars base currently abandoned
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:57:40 mars base is game being worked (or was worked) by rolijok (owner of innovation security), i think development stalled for labs remake
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:59:39 ah ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 10:59:48 blacksite is fan made
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:00:50 also moon base is being worked by (also fan made)
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:01:50 yeah, innovation inc community is more alive then pinewood lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:02:48 yeah, its really better, events got better, one of my favorites events thing they added is for cubes for "shark"
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:03:33 also, is in pinewood ANYTHING being worked on? (no matter, fanmade or official)
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:04:36 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:04:50 also imagine remake of PBCC
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:05:51 ah, so like innovation inc spaceship?
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:06:58 uhhh yeah, currently owner remade few things in core room (oxygen, fuel tank etc), made new space suits, and remade escape pods (not sure about planets)
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:07:30 also update is already out, like month/few weeks ago
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:07:38 owner made exclusive space suit for security lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-04 11:07:54 (just skin for security)
general 2023-04-04 11:16:12 wait guys, so motors 2 broken ONLY in PVP?

creations-chat 2023-04-04 12:06:17 its not meant for normal fight, its meant to fight shredders, shredders cant break TNT armor
creations-chat 2023-04-04 12:09:26 how? its hidden in TNT without reach range of shredders
creations-chat 2023-04-04 12:14:22 ah, can bullets hit when player is blacklisted?
creations-chat 2023-04-04 12:18:58 so can bullets hit you if you blacklisted them?

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:33:21 alright how did i success with V1 of "submerger"?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:37:23 i somehow succeed on making working submirine on first try though i didn knew ANYTHING about building submirines
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:37:36 wth
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:39:33 we have ro-scale, its smaller then roblox character, right?
BUT WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:41:28 ah ok, also yeah sorry, i'm more into space rockets then into planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:42:17 ah ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:43:09 also what you think of this submarine? i somehow managed to make it from first try with no tutorials and knowledge about making submarines
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:43:15 it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:45:55 yeah i called it "submerger v1" lol because i didn't actually expected it to swim
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:47:36 also it swims better then my old tutorial seamoth lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:55:07 what was the speed?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:55:45 just if speed was too high then its roblox problem (physics)
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 21:56:20 yeah probably roblox fault with physics
