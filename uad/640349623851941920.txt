general 2020-02-28 00:54:33 it scared me the first time
general 2020-02-28 00:57:06 o i have a better suggestion what if we can team up with people to build stuff
general 2020-02-28 00:58:22 i don't see a way to build with others
general 2020-02-28 00:58:57 no like build togeter
general 2020-02-28 01:00:12 or we could share ships and planes with each other
general 2020-02-28 01:01:06 well i actually want thos stuff
general 2020-02-28 01:01:22 so i can split up the work
general 2020-02-28 01:02:43 cause someone could make like half of what there good at then the other person can palce in the items to make it fly or the mechanics that there better at
general 2020-02-28 01:03:10 well u will still be using the same blocks as 1 person
general 2020-02-28 01:03:43 also im very bad at mechanical stuff
general 2020-02-28 01:03:52 but i can build very good
general 2020-02-28 01:04:50 theres like 10 more suggestions i could make but im gonna go make a ship
