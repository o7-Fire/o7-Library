general 2023-04-07 03:12:28 they all look the exact same
general 2023-04-07 03:59:14 some materials have different weights. there are blocks known as heavy blocks (i believe is the correct terminology) that are also affected differently by different materials
general 2023-04-07 03:59:19 ice i believe is the lightest
general 2023-04-07 03:59:34 dont quote me on that though
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:13:10 only lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:13:18 hence why its called a motorLOCK tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:13:41 if its powered and locked when you press the keybind itll fuck up
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 04:14:22 its definitely how youre building them, motorlock towers should be able to not be powered and work
general 2023-04-07 04:16:43 ice is heavier on heavy blocks
general 2023-04-07 04:17:13 nams flanker guide has a list of blocks that are lighter when used as wood

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:38:12 literally me with anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:39:17 i love making ghetto solutions to any problem i have on my plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:40:41 i added motor 2 to end of my wings to compensate for swept wing rockets being swept
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:40:58 that is NOT a normal shape
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:41:20 i was wondering why it was a long circle
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:42:17 simple problems require complicated solutions
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:42:36 i have nightmares about motorlock towers i do it so much
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:44:59 i hate exposed motorlock <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:08 im trying to solve this issue right now
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:45:34 my details are 3 rods extending drom the side of my build <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:08 you should not be flinging when spring lock buddy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:11 is it anchored
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:31 i never had that issue w the few times i do
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:50:48 now i just use tnt because fuck non pvp server
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:03 i wish you could spawn straight into pvp server from the website because you could just find empty lobbies
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:10 or near empty
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:30 have you tried using disconnectors instead of springs
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:53:35 might be more annoying to set up but it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:54:02 idk i dont really use them
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:54:12 i just know theres a method w them that also keeps motorlock open
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:54:43 my cat cannot be a real fucking animal bro

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:06:32 f15 is pretty nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:07:01 i like the tomcat because variable sweep wing <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:07:23 jerrymouse indeed EliteVN
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:07:52 not true, the f15 is just a tomcat without variable sweep wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:12 youre right
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:17 i just like how the tomcat looks
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:25 preach
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:08:54 i hate 5th gen

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:10:42 this made me lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:52 i like the lancer
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:11:54 so sexy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:12:35 lancer also had variable sweep <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:18 the f111 is sexy too
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:13:28 honestly any variable sweep makes me feel ways
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:17 the su24 is also fire
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:21 but i hate russian jets in general so
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:31 i dislike
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:14:44 work of art
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:10 wasnt the mig 27 like famously not functional
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:12 or it was one of them
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:18 they were a fucking deathtrap
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:40 it is cool
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:42 but a death machine
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:15:51 the mig9 has its cannon on the air intake and it bothers me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:17:58 i dislike
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:18:09 planes with that weird mouth looking intake bother me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:18:43 fuck the f16
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:19:20 mouth intake ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:19:22 as shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:03 nope
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:08 mouth intake will never look good
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:16 especially when its the whole nose of the plane thats an intake
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:44 harrier had potential if it wasnt also a death trap
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:20:53 happy plane : D
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:07 it is horrendous
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:21:19 idk who comes up with these planes dude
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:05 needs swept variable wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:22:56 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:09 is prototype
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:23:43 it looks better than normal f15
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:24:53 me too
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:03 the f15 is a poor mans f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:34 i am a f14 fan forever
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:50 nothing else did variable aweep better than the f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:25:58 unde jet be like
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:26:23 functionally the mig 27 was disaster so i wont allow it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:26:30 the 23 was pretty ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:03 sweep wing should be the standard
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:09 allow for better aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:33 + one of the fastest manned aircraft in the 60’s
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:27:48 the f14 version 2 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:11 whats this called
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:22 its beautiful
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:30 its like a better f22
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:29:43 + variable sweep
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:25 i agree
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:33 lord
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:38 why didnt they make f22 for navy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:30:44 that plane is actually sezy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:31:35 but variable sweep wings ☹️
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:20 it was a proposed navy design wasnt it?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:31 they shouldve made it even if it was stealth
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:33 just because of the wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:46 who care about the functionality
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:32:55 VARIABLE WINGS CARRY
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:33:51 variable wings are good for supersonic/transonic
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:33:53 good for stealth
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:34:18 this is what ive been saying
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:34:40 i love variable swept wing so much i went through the pain of putting them on my pvp jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:15 i wanna build an f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:27 and now with the knowledge it exists the f22 naval concept
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:43 especially ones that look seamless
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:35:48 mine are very clearly ghetto
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:36:26 but can u do variable sweep
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:00 its when the wings change shale to be more aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:02 shape*
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:04 or positioning
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:21 THIS IS WHAT IM SAYING
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:24 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:29 or mig27
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:37:46 variable sweep is annoying for roscale imo
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:38:31 show
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:39:04 me and my cat are straight jamming to this music rn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:39:55 thats nice looking
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:02 cleaner than my variable sweep
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:40:43 is too small to be roscale but its close enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:37 angle lock or middle
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:46 wtf
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:46 not sngle lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:41:48 motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:51 im gonna try to make my pvp actual roscale
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:42:54 not shitty nam scale
the-dump 2023-04-08 05:44:29 is cat
the-dump 2023-04-08 05:44:50 i forgot the name of her breed
the-dump 2023-04-08 05:44:57 its like nebe something
the-dump 2023-04-08 05:45:07 no is not Britishlonghair
the-dump 2023-04-08 05:45:19 is nebelung cat
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:46:24 some people have jet proportions way fucked
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:46:33 a lot of jets are fucking juge and they make them the size of large trucks
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:04 big ass wing and tiny fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:12 i cannot cope with this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:17 they haunt me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:29 the f14 was a fucking giant of a plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:46 i do this aswell
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:59 end result isnt even the same plane most of the time
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:48:13 because people who make tuts have horribly optimized planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:48:51 ive seen like 5 madvulpen b2 bombers today
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:13 LMFAO
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:22 nam nam
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:34 for speed
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:49:45 but realistically if you have hover engines weight doesnt mayter
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:08 i used a nam guide for my control surfaces and thats about it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:12 i love m2m
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:39 like i said horribly optimized
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:50:50 there is genuinely no customization options with nam jets
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:03 they all look the same
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:25 i have a shit ton of ballast on mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:51:38 because there isnt many options on 1 wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:52:08 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:03 namlings try not to make the same fucking plane challenge (impossible!!!)
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:17 what do u use for afterburners
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:54:44 thats NICe
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:00 m2m is my prefer im horrible at wasd
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:21 how long are the trail durations or whatever
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:24 to get them that long
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:55:39 yeah me too at first it was pretty bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:08 fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:56:22 like 600-800
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:57:02 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:57:17 https://tenor.com/view/impressive-very-nice-patrick-bateman-gif-15247511
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:58:00 i wish there were half block corners
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:58:06 for wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:58:33 oretty much the same as mine
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:59:52 wtf is this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:02 what color smoke pipe?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:12 ohh
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:23 strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:02:28 rickje should change that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:07:00 my motorlock isnt motorlocking i hate fixing shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:24 nope it is
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:31 you can set the controls before you place them
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:08:38 its helpful for lock towers
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:09:43 i knew someone who did
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:04 i told him about that feature one day he probably lost his shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:36 this is my plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:10:41 my lock tower is unnecessarily high
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:12:32 literally me
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:00 yes for my wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:05 before i found an easier way to sweep them
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:15 so now theyre stuck like that because im too lazy to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 06:13:34 i have a clump of motorlock that is literally unnecessary making my build ugly

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:30:45 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:33:44 thrust vectoring is annoying to implement
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:33:59 but propeller engines help with rolling at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:34:30 + annoying to execute correctly without having a dumb looking plane
general 2023-04-08 17:37:43 is just american copies
creations-chat 2023-04-08 17:38:02 thats roscale dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:40:39 why not just put the motorlock further down and add a block over it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:41:34 is a hypothetical question
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:42:24 at least ur planning ahead
creations-chat 2023-04-08 17:42:43 who bit into bros wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:45:48 i hate doing this with big builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:45:50 it gets laggy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:47:44 you should make it thinner or something and have it smooth to the flatter part more
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:55:39 hms Elizabeth?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:55:40 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:55:45 or thats what im assuming that ship is
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:03:34 how would you connect those?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:03:38 magnets i presume?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:04:08 oh strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:04:17 i always thought 2 player ships were used w magnets
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:05:37 thats pretty sick
creations-chat 2023-04-08 18:06:18 unfortunately there are limits
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:06:45 atleast motorlocking is over
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:06:47 such a pain sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:06:56 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:09:04 how do you figure
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:10:17 it’s literally a plane crazy discord
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:12:27 this does make me sad
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:12:48 would kill to see a roscale carrier (nevermind it being literally impossible
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:13:28 if <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:14:01 ive seen big joint account builds but never anything as big as an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:14:12 uavs
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:17:18 i stand corrected
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:17:30 also nevermind the carrier them f14s are absolutely gorgeous
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:18:14 i think, the refrence picture they sent earlier was also elizabeth
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:19:29 plane crazy players never fail to amaze me
general 2023-04-08 18:19:55 autism planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:21:43 aircraft carriers are so sexy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:24:12 ok some definitely arent
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:24:22 but like the Gerald r ford is so beautiful
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:07 i hate f35
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:17 really anything past the f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:22 except for the f22 naval concept
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:28 fat and ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:36 also vtol isn’t exactly practical besides the navg
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:25:38 navy
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:26:04 i love the f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:26:06 it is my baby
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:27:05 but the f14 was already a proportionately bigger plane than the f35 and the f35 still looks fat
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:27:17 just gotta guestimate and see what works
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:05 fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:11 they should make it swept wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:16 would be way better
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:24 especially because it has stealth uses
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:45 me aswell
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:28:49 i just like planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:29:40 the us should keep using f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:30:06 honestly this is the only plane anyone ever neeeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:30:44 i know
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:30:53 iran still have f14 but yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:30:59 they should kept production anyways
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:31:19 or atleast bave grumman design similar planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:31:36 because the f14 was an absolute work of art
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:31:42 it makes me feel ways no plane ever has before
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:31:51 the perfect specimen
creations-chat 2023-04-08 18:35:57 DONT watch this tutorial its fucking shit nam planes are terrible and the only good part was like 5 mins in part 1 where he talks about material science

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:50:52 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:51:17 someone copied my build with the script i dont think it worked for them because they couldnt really fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:54:58 shit is badass

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:01:10 cv 12
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:01:42 i dont think cv8 had the f14 lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:03:03 had
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:03:08 the f14 isnt in service anymore
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:03:43 the biggest piece of garbage ive ever seen ‼️
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:03:50 i hope they do its an ugly plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:04:15 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:05:05 basically any american aircraft past the 70’s
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:05:32 besides the f14 that thing was sexy and unmatched
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:06:19 i like the f22 naval concept but otherwise the f22 is a pretty mediocre 5th gen
help 2023-04-09 00:08:24 the same color as the skeleton theyre connected to
help 2023-04-09 00:08:28 or the grey part
bug-reports 2023-04-09 00:25:12 local58?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:33:40 show
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:33:59 that works
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:46:38 no variable sweep compares to the f14
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:46:53 literally the best variable swept wing aircraft of all time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:47:02 and really any plane of all time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:48:55 though i would love to see the f22 with variable sweep
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:49:01 i plan to make one at some point
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:51:44 nah swept wings make anything look good
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:57:07 the navy concept just reinforces my statement
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:57:18 the f22 is an ugly ass plane in itself
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 00:57:27 but looks way better as a flying dorito
creations-chat 2023-04-09 00:58:16 i dont think so
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:07:26 hof is not a very big flex
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:08:21 is for supersonic
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:12:58 underrated
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:13:17 the tomcat doesnt get the recognition it deserves
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:13:25 for being one of the best airplanes to ever fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:16:06 need f22 naval <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:16:27 they couldnt really destroy them when they were around too
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:16:39 i agree
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:31:09 speed foes not always mean better
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 01:31:35 though it was a nice jet im sure there were trials it went through hence why it never made it to service
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:43:52 whos we <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:53:11 how do i become this we
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:17:56 someone has said this before and ive agreed but building tutorials and making them completely new planes is ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:18:19 or it suffices
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:18:27 tutorials outright is just pure laziness
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:18:55 but if youre actively trying to make it unique or not be just a 1 for 1 replica its fine
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:25:41 yes they can
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:25:51 are you sure the settings are right
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:26:06 how are they refusing
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:26:10 are they just sitting still
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:26:50 is there anything not allowing them to move
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:26:56 like motorlock or something
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:32:14 what is even happening with this plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:32:34 ballast block
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:33:25 why are there jet engines if propeller
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:35:38 thats an a-22
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:36:00 got the a10 jets???
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:36:07 it’s literally hurting my brain
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 02:36:48 what the shitfuck

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 08:36:48 to magnetize shit duh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 08:37:08 ur best bet is probably pistons or springs
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 08:38:10 springs will stick out whichever way you put them though so probably on the hangar deck because it wont be glaringly obvious

help 2023-04-09 09:26:08 to my knowledge the mig25 has one at the tip of it nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:27:35 where
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:27:53 the floating one?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:28:52 to be fair there isnt really a good way to hide folding motors like that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:29:04 just gotta take that rare L unfortunately
help 2023-04-09 09:29:10 yes
help 2023-04-09 09:29:16 is to measure air or something like that

general 2023-04-09 15:44:08 how do you use cameras to fold
general 2023-04-09 15:44:46 <@858708891943960578>  this might solve the floating motor problem
general 2023-04-09 15:47:06 camera locking
general 2023-04-09 15:47:10 though he didnt explain it well
general 2023-04-09 15:57:54 they dont give out master anymore
general 2023-04-09 15:57:55 or hof
general 2023-04-09 15:58:40 they havent done it in almost exactly a year, safe to say they just dont do it
general 2023-04-09 15:59:13 eat uranium and find out if its still in the game
general 2023-04-09 15:59:57 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-04-09 16:00:00 yes
general 2023-04-09 16:00:10 oil rigs dont float
general 2023-04-09 16:00:16 theyre drilled into the ground
general 2023-04-09 16:00:29 unless it moves no
general 2023-04-09 16:01:14 yes
general 2023-04-09 16:01:23 theyre still fixed into the ground
general 2023-04-09 16:01:33 i know that
general 2023-04-09 16:01:39 but they are anchored into the ground
general 2023-04-09 16:01:47 so is not like theyre going anywhere
general 2023-04-09 16:02:23 nope not the drill
general 2023-04-09 16:02:37 they have chains and ropes connecting to them that keep them from floating away
general 2023-04-09 16:02:49 before if they were just free floating it would break the pipe
general 2023-04-09 16:03:02 and also be a serious safety hazard
general 2023-04-09 16:07:01 whaf is based iff
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:18:08 what other techniques
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:18:32 i presume magnets?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:19:25 you might have to test and see but i dont think do
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:19:49 magnets are pretty good at connecting shit (because thats what theyre made for)
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:20:47 they would definitely solve the motor issue tho, seamless fit
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:21:07 youd just have to find a way to connect them because from what i see its folding from upside down

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:31:15 yeah i figured it was a 262
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:31:29 just about the only german jet people talk about
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:32:47 yeah its just just horribly overrated
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:33:08 i suppose germany doesn’t have quite the size airforce it used to have likely why people like me262 so much
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:35:37 basically the mig37
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:35:49 wait no
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:35:51 wrong plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:36:13 mig27
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:36:30 except the me262 wasnt a flying killbox for the pilot

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:38:55 to be fair like anything german it was over engineered
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:39:43 i would love to see a modern take on it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 16:41:13 tes like 1936

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:37:47 architect i suppose
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:38:05 you dont have to make anything work you just have to build something and get upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:38:15 which is currently what ive been working for
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:38:28 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:38:29 architect
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:38:47 designer is also easy to get
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 17:39:06 i suppose the ground vehicle aswell
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:00:38 i have a feeling it just keeps getting worse
creations-chat 2023-04-09 18:01:34 the proportions are so fucked bro
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:01:43 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:02:18 yes
creations-chat 2023-04-09 18:07:35 definitely
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:11:06 because he hit the terrain
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:11:36 show me a side profile of your heli
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:12:12 the main rotor might not he long enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:12:17 also why are there only 2 blades on it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:12:27 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:12:41 i was gonna say the reason its not working is cus the rotor doesnt even work right
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:12:49 but if its fake it’s probably to do with balancing
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:13:17 try adding ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:13:19 or helium
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:13:35 youre gonna have to do some trial and error
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:13:55 or fix it idk im not super educated on helicopters
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:14:58 the arms you have on the side
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:15:04 try adding weight to those
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:15:28 show
general 2023-04-09 18:15:54 are u guys flaming the one and only Liam_hereis
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:17:26 what are you using to turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:17:42 like yaw
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:17:49 strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:18:29 add more see if that changes anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:18:33 if not then its not a weight issue
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:18:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:18:49 for each
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:20:40 thats really strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:21:14 does one side weigh more than the oyher
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:21:23 like before you had ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:22:29 tryna think
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:22:33 could it be the rotors or something
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:22:58 fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:23:21 would adding more blades to the propeller do anything
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:23:24 if it helps with stability
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:24:03 in 15 year indeed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:24:58 what the shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:25:50 is the entire heli ice
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:27:27 maybe thats the problem
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:31:28 have you considered actually using the rotors instead of them being fake
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:31:35 or is that off the table
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:32:45 i respect that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:32:50 have you tried using other types of engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:33:12 what about rocket
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 18:33:25 oh yeah ur right
general 2023-04-09 18:49:40 rip liam
general 2023-04-09 18:49:53 free my boy liam
help 2023-04-09 19:02:26 show
help 2023-04-09 19:07:08 are you sure the center of weight is actually centered
help 2023-04-09 19:07:36 no
help 2023-04-09 19:07:53 the center of gravity?
help 2023-04-09 19:08:35 oh what the shit
help 2023-04-09 19:08:50 probably
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:26:15 camera lock works by changing the direction of welded blocks to the direction the camera is facing
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:27:36 you connect them to the motors and lock it, camera lock is essentially just a different way to get custom angles (besides angle lock which is far better)
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:28:14 is it not connecting
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:29:09 show
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:29:39 you use the config tool to rotate the cam to face a block
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:29:55 it resets every time you leave so its smart to have helium blocks to keep their place
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:23 also the camera should be at the same level the main pilot seat is otherwise itll for some reason break
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:30:45 its really aids but it is how it is
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:32:18 sweep
general 2023-04-09 19:33:10 funxd.co
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:35:19 motor angle lock way better
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:36:16 do you already have a motorlock tower or not
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:36:39 just stick it out the side of the tower and jt wont beed to be covered up
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:37:40 what you need to be angle locked make it stick out the side so that you dont have to do any extra shit to cover it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:37:44 if its already covered
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:38:17 cam locking is very complicated and not worth jumping through the stupid hoops
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:42:52 wow
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 19:44:45 impressive

yeah i spelt it wrong concept still applies

plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:56:02 add weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:56:05 nevermind
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:56:07 its heavy
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:56:24 how fast do you fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:04 dont follow nams guide
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:06 its fucking shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:26 the reason it wobbles is because there arent enough wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:28 or youre too light
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:47 if youre going past 1000 sps add more weight even if its already heavy
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:57:55 and add a fuck ton of wing panel
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:58:12 obviously the wings but if you can add a motorlock tower and put panels on that
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 00:58:49 do your wings not bave wing panels? <@558434031725838337>

plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:01:20 whatever is weighing ur plane down remove and put wing panels itll add more weight than trapdoors and actually fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:01:31 2 birds with 1 stone
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:02:17 trap doors literally only work for weight reduction
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:02:26 they serve no other purpose
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:03:05 that’s because wing panels have more weight
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:03:13 you said ur jet is heavy
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 01:03:17 so get rid of the heavy shit

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:45:55 i try to make my plane weight efficient
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:46:05 just to add weight in the form of ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:47:20 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:47:25 what autistic namnam players call roscale
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:47:43 but i need just enough weight that it doesnt violently shake when i go fast

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:52:59 torque?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:17 depends on what is connected
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:21 its weight variable
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:53:26 like real torque
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 01:54:04 more torque is good for heavy stuff

plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:21:57 control surfaces are in my experience unreliable at following cursor tho
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:22:25 press control automatically when config them
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:22:29 or something along those lines
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:23:49 ur better off using motor 2 for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:24:31 control surfaces on a plane are what make rudders and elevators  and whatnot
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:24:54 motor 2 have an option to follow cursor and is typically way better than control surfaces ingame
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:25:16 connect a wing panel to motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-05-03 07:25:27 turn on inverted and it should follow ur cursor

general 2023-05-08 23:35:17 pcc member when unde is smarter than them
general 2023-05-08 23:36:50 the kar98k was not outdated by 43 at all
general 2023-05-08 23:37:16 why would it still have extensive use in wars past that if it was outdated
general 2023-05-08 23:37:51 with this logic the 1911 is far outdated
general 2023-05-08 23:38:16 its a roblox game
general 2023-05-08 23:40:53 hence why they aren’t used for infantry
general 2023-05-08 23:40:58 but that doesnt make them obsolete
general 2023-05-08 23:45:02 historically the kar98k is a very good rifle
general 2023-05-08 23:45:08 no opinions just facts
general 2023-05-08 23:45:52 but what in particular makes it bad to you
general 2023-05-08 23:46:55 you said that the opponents had different types of guns, that doesnt make the 98k bad
general 2023-05-08 23:47:49 yes

general 2023-05-08 23:51:52 thats doesnt make it bad dumbass
general 2023-05-08 23:52:01 youre comparing two different types of firearm
general 2023-05-08 23:52:23 obviously a semiautomatic rifle will be better than a bolt action for a cqc environment
general 2023-05-08 23:52:47 but you cant state any real issues with the gun, only that other countries use different ones
