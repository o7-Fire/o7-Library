general 2023-01-10 02:44:35 is there a reason why paint blocks have that weird seem in between them
general 2023-01-10 02:44:43 answers prolly obvious but ive always thought it was weird
general 2023-01-10 02:45:41 oh
general 2023-05-06 07:29:21 I have a suggestion for PC2 or potentially a future Plane Crazy update but I dont know how to get it to the devs.

Its similar to the existing rope block but instead of it being only 2 blocks long you instead choose precisely where each end of the rope block is placed.

For example, if your doing ropes on a ship and you want to put ropes between 2 masts you can place one part of the rope on one mast and place the other end on the other mast.

You would also be able to change the thickness and the other settings that you can normally do to ropes, but minus the extend and retract tools to avoid glitchyness
general 2023-05-06 07:30:48 i dont know i just thought it was a cool idea
general 2023-05-06 07:32:43 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
