[extra rockets/cylinders]

[building]

Large rocket will have a varient that places like the 2 2x2 cylinder. this could make it easier for a lot of people building somewhat larger jets. There could also be a 4x4 and 2 4x4 cylinder. The sections of the rocket nozzle could also be colored individually, instead of painting the whole thing.

bot-central 2021-12-21 18:11:19 &suggest [extra rockets/cylinders]

[building]

Large rocket will have a varient that places like the 2 2x2 cylinder. this could make it easier for a lot of people building somewhat larger jets. There could also be a 4x4 and 2 4x4 cylinder. The sections of the rocket nozzle could also be colored individually, instead of painting the whole thing.

creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:50:01 why do you keep yelling about builds and their ratio, like with all due respect nobody asked
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:53:28 m8 that good jet build was posted SEVERAL HOURS after the engine and even more after the panzer 3. it takes time for the ratio to change and there's also fluxuations with how many new people there are.
Just think for a bit before complaining please
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:56:40 what about the purple plane with the bocky tail? that's not a correct ratio?
even though there's problems and it can look bad people can still like the build for it's concept or just for trying to build it
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:13:19 I'm trying to make a point that the voting system for creations is not concrete at all, the amount of people change, and the things that people like change. so comparing the ratio of a 'good jet' that was posted recently to that of a 'bad tank' that was posted at 3 in the morning isn't really the best when complaining about quality and the ratio they deserve
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:18:52 well so be it.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:22:35 we know the tank looks bad, we know it has a bunch of upvotes, just get over it.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:38:48 wonder when he'll stop complaining abut the panzer 3
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:41:37 just salty that a build doesn't have the exact ratio you want it to have
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:45:27 still not just to be constantly berating some guys first build
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:47:42 and where do you get that he has the skill to make it better? what if he doesn't?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:53:05 and just because he can means he should put all his effort into making the first build he posts? 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:56:46 alright, I'll post a build when i finally get home from the road trip
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:02:16 did you read the description of his build? he realises the lack of roadwheels *after* posting

But he doesn't want to Or he doesn't care enough to fix it, like he's said before

bot-central 2022-08-31 15:50:19 $suggest
[camera hud]
[configurable]

It would essentially mix a sign block into the camera block, giving the camera a config to write text in for making a hud. would make some things easier.
bot-central 2022-08-31 15:50:41 it didn't work <:nooo:787097964946259978>

Can't be removed, moved, or anything, stays when nobody's in the plot. It's been there for like 3 days at least.
