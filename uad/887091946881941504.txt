general 2022-12-28 17:08:24 guys have u ever thought of using propellers for buttons
general 2022-12-28 17:08:57 you can use propellers for buttons
general 2022-12-28 17:09:08 you gotta motorlock it tho
general 2022-12-28 17:09:17 you know that stick on the little propeller
general 2022-12-28 17:09:28 motorlock that into a wall and you get like a button
general 2022-12-28 17:10:07 or like a rack
general 2022-12-28 17:10:47 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:11:28 guys im making a circular sphere
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:11:31 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:11:47 a full made sphere the size of 18 blocks in length, and width.
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:12:03 actually
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:12:25 i dare someone to motorlock a sphere 7 blocks in length and width
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:12:33 you cant do it with even numbers
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:12:58 bro
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:13:07 are u the king of the castle tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:13:10 i actually lied
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:13:14 i dont wanna image perm that much
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:13:31 how
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:13:46 i ran out of my building space
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:14:16 cause it was bigger than it could possibly be
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:14:42 ikr
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:14:58 we need a gamepass for infinite building space only upwards
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:15:38 ikr
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:15:47 it would crash the server
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:16:40 guys i got another idea, make a batmovile with motorlocks and the cleanest building ever
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:17:08 dont tell me thats a bad idea
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:17:26 or else your make a full scale saturn v in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:17:38 bro
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:17:54 what can u even build, that no one has
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:18:25 a functional five nights at freddy
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:18:54 uhh
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:18:56 it works
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:19:35 working aminatronics
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:19:43 with cycles
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:19:49 to move to different places
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:20:17 actually no
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:20:38 im thinking
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:20:43 put them on a cart
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:20:56 that goes around in a endless loop
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:21:08 then make the cart go down beneath the first cycle
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:21:17 and then make another path
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:21:33 then connect it with the 1st cycle again
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:21:59 animated aminatronics is not happening
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:22:05 not possible
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:22:18 no one here
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:22:29 noone the guy pinged you
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:24:17 to make a jumpscare
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:24:29 all u gotta do is just hide a model beneath the office
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:24:40 sheesh
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:24:54 wasn't it less expensive before
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:25:28 im being dum
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:25:35 there is no collision in this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:26:03 actually
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:26:31 you gotta hide it behind a wall and then make a wall that moves
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 17:26:39 its not impossible
