plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:44:36 Probably because I've never done it.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:45:01 I STILL haven't used it, and I've been playing for 3 months. I'm resisting the temptation.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:45:38 N e v e r.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:46:04 I will hold true on this promise.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:47:49 I mostly have locomotives and a couple of mechs with a few odds and ins. I'd say they're average.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 03:47:55 I am working on something pretty big, though.

plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:03:07 AT&SF?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:04:06 Oh, yeah. Got mixed up.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:04:29 I don't think I've ever seen UP do a 4-12-2 before.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:05:30 
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:05:52 The C&O Mallet?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:05:57 Dang.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:06:16 I'll get to see the 4014 on his 2021 tour soon.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:06:43 D a n g.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:07:17 The auger?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:07:43 Sounds epic.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:08:55 I take it you went to St. Louis and saw the 4460?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:09:20 I saw her in person a few years ago.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:09:32 I also got to see 844 back in 2012.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:09:37 D a n g.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:10:32 3985 is the challenger, right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:11:06 Epic.

Also, if you lived in the west/midwest, you could see the 4014 going on his tour.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:11:15 Oh dang.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:11:41 Ah.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:12:09 There's nothing more sad than seeing them rust away.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:12:13 Just like 4460.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:12:23 
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:12:27 She's kind of neglected.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:12:57 It'd be amazing if they fixed her up and put her on a double header with 4449.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 04:13:15 Exactly.
