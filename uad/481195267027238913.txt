plane-crazy 2021-06-30 23:53:35 the group being called "trm"
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 23:59:18 lol nice
creations-chat 2021-07-02 06:54:42 e
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 02:02:25 I don’t think that’s how that works
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:28:57 It takes the motor and takes the bottom part down half a block
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:29:03 That’s all it does
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:29:27 It’s not too useful unless you wanna detail stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 11:00:21 Looks pretty good
creations-chat 2021-09-28 11:03:21 Badass mech

creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:17:18 idk whats the longest tank before
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:23:33 question what is the longest tank someone has built in the video game
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:26:00 no this is my longest

creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:28:14 no too lazy to do that its not meant to look good its meant to be dumb as hell
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:32:09 im supposed to make things proportional for realism?
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:34:37 mm bloke
creations-chat 2021-10-16 04:39:59 klark u blind

creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:17:56 train wheels funny <:trollface:775024642104229898> 
turret thicc becuse guns for pvp mode
i am stroke man
yes it is disproportionate but its still recognisable
creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:21:35 my most valid point is the turret point because i actually use it as a pvp weapon
creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:23:37 show i want examples, i wanna learn
creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:26:46 i personally never liked those types, the sparkler or whatever they are called bois leave those squares
creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:29:06 how does tnt remove parts of an actual block
creations-chat 2021-10-16 05:31:08 god why do plane crazy youtubers never use their voice

creations-chat 2021-10-16 18:44:57 <:trollface:775024642104229898> too bad lol i like it so lol
creations-chat 2021-10-16 18:57:38 because its not realistic to the exact centimeter (according to this channel)
creations-chat 2021-10-16 18:59:41 majority opinion = facts gotcha

the-dump 2021-11-21 20:10:40 
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 01:38:11 the large amount of it, not just a lil bit of use for a turret and such, its just the use of having so much it makes up half the blocks.
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 01:38:45 why not just post the video file??
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 01:39:41 i dont use the creations channel often aight?
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 01:41:28 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2022-01-15 04:01:28 with a lil bit of landscaping it'd look pretty good
creations-chat 2022-01-15 05:04:13 id say more on the outside, but the vines do look nice.
