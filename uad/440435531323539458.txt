general 2022-04-01 03:23:14 No man
general 2022-04-01 03:23:27 It’s “why real wasabi is so expensive” by buisiness insider
general 2022-04-01 03:23:37 I thought it was cool
general 2022-04-01 03:23:46 Real wasabi is actually not very spicy
general 2022-04-01 03:23:49 It’s sweet
general 2022-04-01 03:23:58 And it has no horseradish in it
general 2022-04-01 03:24:08 Thanks
general 2022-04-01 03:24:16 That’s the video
general 2022-04-01 03:24:36 Horseradish 🗿
general 2022-04-01 03:24:53 Yeah
general 2022-04-01 03:25:08 Wasabi is awsome
general 2022-04-01 03:25:14 It clears ur sinus

general 2022-04-01 03:26:52 It’s insane
general 2022-04-01 03:26:58 It tastes very different
general 2022-04-01 03:27:08 Real wasabi
general 2022-04-01 03:27:55 It’s much more earthy and less spicy, a little less spicy and with a sweet after taste. It’s very unique though and it’s hard to describe, like the flavour of truffle
general 2022-04-01 03:28:38 Just saw that
general 2022-04-01 03:28:45 I love mustard
general 2022-04-01 03:28:54 He makes me shid

general 2022-04-01 03:29:59 Yellow mustard is overrated and disgusting, Dijon mustard is awsome and tastes cool
general 2022-04-01 03:30:37 Yellow mustard tastes bitter and Dijon mustard tastes savoury and spicy
general 2022-04-01 03:31:07 But mustard uploaded the vid earlier today

general 2022-04-07 04:31:01 You are a normal ass guy who played 200 hours of warthunder and then gave up like a good person

general 2022-04-07 04:35:17 Unless you hit ammo it can take upwards of 10 shots to kill someone’s
general 2022-04-07 04:35:28 Ye
general 2022-04-07 04:36:03 It’s unrealistically bad, it will literally go through and hit a crew member in the face and the crew member will be INJURED
general 2022-04-07 04:36:12 INJURED
general 2022-04-07 04:36:33 after taking a 7 pound shell travelling at Mach 4 to the face
general 2022-04-07 04:36:43 ANYWAYS
general 2022-04-07 04:36:54 It’s ridiculous though
general 2022-04-07 04:37:11 Gaijins gonna gaijin

general 2022-04-07 04:38:48 The m18 is bad in game
general 2022-04-07 04:38:53 It’s so easy to kill
general 2022-04-07 04:38:57 Smart
general 2022-04-07 04:39:19 Half the time you just get strafed in the m18

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:50:36 I made Saab Gripen
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:51:00 And everyone thinks it’s a eurofighter when I fly it 😞
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:57:35 Mach 3 plus
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:58:36 Fast enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:59:48 I just felt like correcting you to prove my “knowledge” gained by wasting thousands of hours of my pathetic life on warthunder so that I can need out about tanks whenever they appear on the projector in history class and bug my classmates
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:00:39 The tank?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:00:57 I felt like accurately describing a wehraboo
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:01:17 The post penetration is unrealistically bad like all British tanks in warthunder sadly
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:11 Gaijin feel like clowning on every kind of solid shot if it’s below 84mm
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:33 It will literally hit a crew member in the face and they turn yellow 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:52 It also just simply won’t ignite ammo
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:02:58 Idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:07 You can outrun that
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:13 My gripen can outrun that
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:45 I’d probably accidentally hit the ejector button like a goof tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:50 Facts
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:03:58 God damn how do you control it
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:04:09 Damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:04:43 Would an ejector seat still work at that speed?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:04 ☹️
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:28 Prank lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:05:54

plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:06:05 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:06:46 Oh damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:00 Do you get good maneuverability?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:09 What do you use for maneuvering?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:40 I mean like manual ailerons or control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:07:54 Ye lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:08:23 I can outurn a shredder and it’s fun watching them struggle to aim their camera at me 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:08:41 Canard/Delta wings are wild
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:08 The only limit is that if I put the motors to high power the plane will stall 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:13 They are so fun
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:20 Absolute game changer
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:48 You need more lift maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:09:53 Or just more thrust to weight
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:06 Daaamn
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:24 Too heavy not enough thrust
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:38 Damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:10:44 Then maybe it’s lift
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:11:22 My gripen maneuvers beautifully even at sub 150 because the wings are fucking massive
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:11:50 You can do midair donuts 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:12:39 It doesn’t change the physics model probably
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:13:51 Woah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:14:21 Cause the control surface is gone or it’s just wack
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 03:14:34

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 03:03:10 Oh damn that’s not true
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 03:03:24 Most of us are not polite and not sane 😃
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 03:04:07 Yeah perhaps
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 03:04:14 Americans are so mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 03:04:44 And we do have unique foods!
