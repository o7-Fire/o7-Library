plane-crazy 2021-12-22 22:32:16 Hello everyone
general 2021-12-27 06:23:25 Hello everyone
general 2021-12-27 06:24:11 I was wondering if there was a way to have a co-pilot
general 2021-12-27 06:24:26 man
general 2021-12-27 06:24:56 so how is everyone doing
general 2021-12-27 06:25:08 I recently made my rescue VTOL flyable
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:24:39 america big
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:24:47 north = 20 celcius = ok
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:24:56 south = oh man 20 celcius cold
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:25:56 that's like around 60-65 degrees fahrenheit I think
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:26:03 for context 70 degrees fahrenheit is comfortable
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:27:44 for some reason I feel like oolnubo is a troll
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:42:56 celcious is about 3x smaller than fahrenheit
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:43:09 20 celcious = around 60 or 70 fahrenheit
the-dump 2022-04-16 22:43:32 what
general 2022-09-16 20:34:07 hello chat
general 2022-09-16 20:36:30 I'm wondering how to motorlock but also make it look good
general 2022-09-16 20:36:44 I have a tank with a turret but the turret looks awful and hovers just barely above the hull
general 2022-09-16 20:37:21 yup
general 2022-09-16 20:37:31 there is no motorlock
general 2022-09-16 20:37:43 I would show you but I have no image perms
general 2022-09-16 20:37:55 the thing is I don't know how to make motor lock work
general 2022-09-16 20:38:59 I guess I'll practice using motor lock in my builds, I keep seeing these builds that have like 100 upvotes and they have unreal amounts of detail
general 2022-10-13 21:43:53 Hello chat
general 2022-10-14 06:08:46 hello chat how does one thrust vectoring
general 2022-10-14 06:09:02 I want to make a silly super-maneuverable plane and I'm not sure how
general 2022-10-14 06:09:28 what
general 2022-10-14 06:10:04 so any useful tips on making super-maneuverable aircraft?
general 2022-10-14 06:10:53 ah okay thanks
the-dump 2022-10-18 05:01:31 you need to talk in text channels and "level up" to get image perms
