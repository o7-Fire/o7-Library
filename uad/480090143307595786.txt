plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:29:35 If one of us were to create a thumbnail and madattack would like it, could it be used on the gamepage 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:45:19 Superidra, I posted a question like 15 minutes ago in this channel, could you please scroll up a little and see if you can answer it?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:45:52 And I'm assuming his DMs are closed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:46:00 I don't have the balls to test it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:46:04 ok
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:46:35 Is he active in the staff channel?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:20 I'll see if I can manage
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:28 :thonk:
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:48 Is your speed bar like fully blue
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:47:55 if so just try again
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:48:22 Show us your speed bar
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:48:42 do you have anchor blocks maybe
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:49:29 Try moving the entire thing up once or something
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:49:40 Is it just me or are super rockets not so super
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:50:31 Right but the large ones provide more thrust
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:51:13 But they provide more thrust yes?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:51:59 When it does, I just re-test it again
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:02 but yes occasionally
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:16 (When that happens, my creations dont move)
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 22:52:48 I think you mean LoneBessPizza
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 23:07:31 How did people keep their rockets stable in the air

help 2018-10-31 00:54:04 Have you played BYM before?
help 2018-10-31 00:59:18 Anyway BYM stands for Build Your Mech and it was a game with a similar concept to plane crazy, but it had more available parts.
It was recently shut down because it 🅱roke.
In the game, you could "compress" objects, meaning that you can fit 10 blocks in a single space that 1 block would fill.
help 2018-10-31 00:59:51 So I was wondering if anyone figured out how to "compress" objects
help 2018-10-31 00:59:52 yes
help 2018-10-31 01:01:48 Thanks.

help 2018-11-09 00:03:02 How would one be able to create a motor that automatically counters the rotation of the object it's attached to
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:04:31 Can someone help me in <#478584971670454284>
help 2018-11-09 00:05:51 Like a gimbal but the object that the rocket is attached to rotates to external forces
help 2018-11-09 00:06:03 motor*, not rocket
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:08:37 I'm pretty close to meeting the requirements for elon musk role
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:08:47 Rocket lands vertically almost every time
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:08:53 Now to actually aim it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:09:21 The new update made the supports less spastic

plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:20:34 Rickje, I think it's time to start working on the UI design
Make it aesthetically pleasing or something.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:20:59 The UI is functional but ugly
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:21:57 Get someone who is <:thonking:509498568982134816>

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:43:25 <@!295568493166985218> Calling someone as lightly as a noob is more of a warning-worthy thing.
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:45:07 It looks great
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:45:24 ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:50:48 question
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:50:54 how did you build that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:51:37 Oh, suspension has those blocks at the top and bottom
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:51:39 /ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:53:53 R.I.P. Stephen Hawking 😢 🙏 🙏
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:54:30 Oh yes Steve Hawking* sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:54:42 The best baseball player in the country
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:54:57 Wasn't he the CEO of samsung
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:55:27 I've successfully triggered three kids
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:55:48 Fair enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:56:12 woah
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:58:19 amazing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:59:15 But won't that make the helicopter unstable
since the motors spin and only two of the actual blades move with one key
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:00:04 Well I don't know what you made in besiege
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:00:34 It's good practice imo
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:00 I don't think it's been done before.
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:13 Give the man his deserved role if it's functional
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:53 Yeah but the blades spin so if only two blades rotate, then it might throw the heli off balane
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:55 balance
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:07:05 ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:07:59 How do magnets work?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:08:12 I cant get them to do anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:08:45 nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:09:12 is this enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:09:28 it is apparently

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:11:12 no u
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:11:33 Do magnets only interact with magnets
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:34:43 Magnets interact with other objects
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:23:00 Imperial WASN'T a mod?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:23:02 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:23:07 <@456226577798135808> congrats
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:23:37 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:24:09 The worst that can happen is a warning
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:24:12 just sayin
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:24:29 That's just unethical
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:15:34 What is love?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:22 I was just demonstrating
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:42 Context matters
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:16 Glitch?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:17 owo
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:20 Explain
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:38 ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:38 Oh that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:46 I thought you meant thrusters
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:18:27 Pickle rick
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:18:49 More like a BUG
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:26 It's a nuisance 
We should replace "bugs" and "glitches" with that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:40 So it's not wrong^
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:46 It is a bug
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:20:01 Rockets aren't meant to blow up stuff in build server
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:20:25 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:20:42 so it's "a bug"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:20:54 But it fits your definition
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:21:10 Not entirely
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:21:29 If the rocket blows stuff up when it's not supposed to
THen something's missing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:21:48 No do a mods job
It was in the survey remember
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:04 wdym something was added
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:22:48 Right but the code that's supposed to make it work only in arena was missing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:23:05 Ok look
How about I use exploits to show you the code
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:23:24 To see what's wrong with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:23:56 Rules don't say anything about that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:23:57 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:15 Oh I didn't read the rules
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:17 I just assumed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:25 Oh that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:26 well
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:36 It's not for malicious purposes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:24:50 Thou shan't kill
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:00 Decompilers
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:01 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:05 that's all basically
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:31 k let's end this
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:25:56 si
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:26:10 I said let's end this

plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:54:14 I think deleting system 32 works a little
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:54:35 It's only good if you're willing to risk some performance though.
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:55:21 Yeah, just a bit.
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:55:49 Like, your framerate will drop by a few fps but it's worth a shot
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:56:29 Yeah, high res is key
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:56:49 Great for work and recreational activities
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:57:08 0fps can take you a long way tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:57:23 It's like, NO lag.
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:57:25 So effective
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:58:05 Hell you almost convinced me to delete system 32

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:11:01 false
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:11:15 Zeppelins have been made b4
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:11:31 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:11:54 wdym
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:12:30 omg same shit rEEEEEE
just use helium blocks and deal with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:12:34 Improvisation 100
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:12:46 are
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:13:11 You're getting too technical here, just use helium and pretend it's hydrogen
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:14:04 You can use a piston that can stop the other end of the suspension, i think
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:14:06 It can be done
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:14:40 so like the piston would extend a block a little and it would interfere w/ the suspension
\
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:36:27 <@!334742188841762819> set the piston to a toggle, when you launch the vehicle just extend the block and it should go through the "spring" part of the suspension because it's noncollide
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:36:53 But since the ends of the suspension themselves are collidable the piston should interfere with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:37:31 When did you post the creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:37:56 this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:10 wdym
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:14 tom
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:21 ikr
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:45 Just DM Imperial with a screenshot of your creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:57 Where the hell is your piston
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:39:37 
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:39:42 like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:40:11 Teh fok is a parasite fighter
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:40:55 so like a star wars battleship
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:41:57 I am aware
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:22 So I didn't think that you were going to use the suspension in that way
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:29 Can you show me the settings of the part
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:37 no, i think
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:58 It be like that sometimes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:13 But why would you tell something like that to god
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:24 He doesn't care
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:40 Well I've got news for you buddy
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:44 God is a myth
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:44:08 But he doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:44:41 Well suggest it to daddy rickje
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:44:52 But it's been suggested loads of times b4
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:45:08 Massive mechanical artificial genitalia
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:45:28 how would mirror work if you can't move parts
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:46:17 But you can move individual parts in those
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:46:33 Ye I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:59:08 thicc
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:57:40 What the living hell is wrong with the server icon
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:57:47 oh nvm

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 11:27:15 it be like that sometimes
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:03:01 What are the suspensions for god damn.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 16:50:46 Why is orangeski being offended by not-actually-offensive nicknames

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:42:27 lmao how'd you manage to grab the font from the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:43:35 feels nice to be ignored
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:44:30 As far as i remember the text wasnt begind that dark background

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:46:47 just woke up, don't stab me
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:49:40 I thought you were claiming to made the tank in the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:49:55 which i know for sure isn't true
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:50:08 in the game thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:50:18 not the video
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:51:32 youre telling me that you made this
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:57:19 ok first of all its been 15 minutes since i w0ke
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:57:37 my iq needs time to wake tf up
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:58:12 second of all, i reffered to the tank in the thumbnail and you said "that tank is also in the vid and i own it"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:58:29 so i was like thy fjųck
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:58:34 k
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:58:50 i switched to the game thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:58:58 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:17:55 when were fuel blocks a thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:18:20 thx
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:24:49 right
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:40:49 <@!429665143677255681> With regards to your previous question about when the thumbnail is coming out, I can start working on it after the 15th because that's probably when I'll be finishing my current commission (which I'm actually being paid for unlike this gig), AND when rickje gives me the creations in studio.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:41:36 My thumbnails were in 4k starting from like 2 months ago.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:08 Yeah but in the event where my potato laptop can't handle rendering in 4k I just step back to 1080p
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:31 I'm poor
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:51 I have a budget of 800 bucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:42:55 for a new laptop
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:43:25 I did my research, I'm not asking for your advice 😃
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:43:52 That smiley face is a little rude so here's a genuine one :)'
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:44:14 You can go shove a chromebook up you know where
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:02 Anyways I had my eyes on the Acer Nitro 5 17' GTX 1650ti for $829.99 at best buy
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:16 It should be more than comfortable with rendering in 4k
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:33 Now that it actually has a graphics card and a 4-core CPU
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:44 Yeah my laptop can't even run CSGO
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:45:59 And mind you I bought it back before when it became free
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:01 Lol I can barely play plane crazy anymore because I get like 5-10 fps on low settings
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:07 Not that I played much anyway
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:47:49 Integrated graphics is the shit man
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:48:15 My laptop doesn't even want to fucking use my integrated graphics card lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:48:29 What icon
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:01 That's a thumbnail yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:14 Clear it out when rickje gives me the creations :)'
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:49:57 Would be nice if you send a DM his way to remind him to choose some creations
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:51:00 You know if you did, that would be the worst burn this server has ever seen
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:51:28 It would to me, it's not like I'm active here
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:52:13 Whatever, back to not checking in on this server in about a month
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:52:24 peace comrade 👌
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 02:53:09 I don't play enough roblox to be involved w/ this community so I'd rather just get back to GETTING PAID WOOO
