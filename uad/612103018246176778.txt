creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:37:06 Black, If you ever want to be respected here, you have to put lots of effort into your builds, like my Arleigh burke class wihth 90+ upvotes, I didn't just build it in 10 minutes, in fact, it took me 3 **days**.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:39:37 <@!745689751805231160> Because they don't understand how low effort it is. People have gotten upset because easy builds like yours got more upvotes than their thing they spent so long on.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:43:03 Yes, But quality is not the same as effort, effort is how hard someone tried, which back then we usually tried our best, but quality is how good it is, building a good looking dolphin in 10 minutes is not effort.
creations-chat 2021-07-01 17:45:37 there isn't, it's around your builds. You, seem like a cool dude, but it makes people upset for low effort to be deemed as "high quality".

creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:33:38 how what
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:38:20 Yes yes I see. I have reasoning on one thing, and others were just me being a dumbass. The reason the gun is so lacking of detail is mainly because the guns actually ***spin*** when I fire them. Also, I don't undestand what you mean by "more accurate?" To me I think the base looks fine, could you specify more?
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:41:06 Well wait, specify what the Aiming thingy is? Is it the area around the gun's base? is it the guns huge forehead? is it the "infared cameras" on the side?
creations-chat 2021-08-08 00:43:39 It is just a basic sight meant to shoot down planes / shredder bugs, not meant to be classy. I will make it to where it looks cool though. (can't make it realistic because the CIWS is actually run by a computer, so it even being operated by a person is unrealistic)

creations-chat 2021-12-27 17:23:41 that doesn't help at all bro, I understand that I got the flights messed up, but other than that saying that it's "wrong" doesn't help in any way.

It IS recognizable, but just an, "eh".  There is also another thing, you should angle lock the sides of the cockpit and maybe even the back next time, it makes it a lot smoother
