The Tale of tacoduke (433057667800367107)
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:19:17 I built a Zeppelin only for monkey brain shredders to destroy it
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:19:45 guess its time to go straight to nuclear and add guided missiles to my already way too defended turret
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:20:32 also is there a way to get pilot seats to actually function so i can have friends control turrets for me on my ships
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:26:13 well i mean the entire thing is rigged with bombs the second you even touch it so
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:26:50 i mean if your using a shredder bug you kinda have to
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:27:31 the zepplin can out maneuver planes quite easily
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:27:51 it goes straight up and down, kind of like chasing a helicopter in an air plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:28:07 what if i told you
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:28:27 ill use my giant turret in a cage surrounded by spikes and rigged with bombs all over
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:28:36 and soon to have guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:29:13 but i am
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:29:20 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:30:29 easy add some helium but no enough to float on its own and app propellers to make it go up
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:30:41 and propellers to turn and go forward
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:30:43 and your done
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:30:49 or ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:30:58 i never thought of ballist blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:31:01 its build time
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:31:16 thats kinda the point of helium
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:31:45 thats what i just said motor with helium
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:32:01 or propellers in my case but ill try a motor because it looks more asthetic
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:32:17 time to make a new USSR zepplin
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:32:44 or literally any other country
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:33:07 motors
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:33:12 what
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:33:15 oh god
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:33:19 you mad man
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:33:28 the water wheel?
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:42:10 i always make the outline of the balloon first
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:42:24 it makes it so much easier
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:42:26 like this
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:42:31 i cant post images
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:48:31 that looks painful
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:49:04 i dont have image perms so cant help much
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 23:49:11 i  mean does it work
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 00:09:02 do ballast tanks work out of water
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 00:17:59 do ballast tanks work out of water
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 00:18:23 you have funne role so do ballast tanks work out of water aka in the air
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 00:20:02 they dont work
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 00:22:03 suspension
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 16:59:01 Is there a way to get other pilot seats to function so I can have other people control guns
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 17:00:14 what is that
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 17:00:18 where does it go
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 17:05:20 pain
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 18:58:22 How would i go about making a drone to connect to my main airship, it always flys wrong and wont turn
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:02:22 how
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:02:53 how to i glitch mouse to make drones work
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:05:55 i figured it out, you put a pilot seat on the drone, fly it around, go back to base, and then put pilot seat back on main ship and it bugs the game to make it work
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:18:04 all my engines are going blub blub blub bur
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:18:37 anyone else get engine blub blub noise yet
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:18:51 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:19:48 you have it to press alt f4 to get rid of it
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 11:20:13 how do i get image perms

events-chat 2022-02-08 13:05:32 so i can do even more random crap <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:24:04 how did they get the landing gear under the half blocks
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:24:32 
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:24:50 oh wait smooth brain moment, the landing gear is the half blocks...
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:30:31 im not even gonna join the event im just trying to copy the builds they posted

events-chat 2022-02-09 10:52:43 I not a very good builder anyways
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:52:59 so it would be a waste of my and the other attendees time
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:53:48 most of my stuff is functional but dosn't look good, and isnt very combat applicable
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 10:58:05 Any tips on stabilizing a zepplin?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 10:58:40 also should i use hover thrusters instead of helium and propellers?
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:28:40 yhea i have quite a few test builds, dosnt usally work out
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:29:00 My most successful are probably my zepplins
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:30:23 i usually get it done right...
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:30:59 i wouldnt say im a complete novice but im very obviously outclassed by a lot of builds i look at
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:49:08 Are low, mid, or high wings the best?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:49:46 a micro fighter
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:50:24 its on of the planes for the event im customizing it, although i might not be able to move wing positions
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:50:33 
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:50:55 thats the thing its supposed to look like
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:51:11 this is what it currently looks like (work in progress thats why it looks bad)
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:51:13 
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:51:53 yhea i know it looks thiccc
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:52:15 im a novice builder lol im not gonna enter for the event
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:52:22 im just screwing around
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:53:12 im mainly practicing copying images and building micro fighters for my drone ship because the default planes look like garbage
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 11:53:40 aka the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:09:13 im having problems with lift
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:09:15 
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:11:13 rip
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:12:09 im assuming the tail fins are too low
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:14:41 whats the point of motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:14:53 even though i dont plan on entering i dont really plan on adding motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:17:10 can i get a dos and donts list for making something completely for functionality
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:18:42 yhea\
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:18:48 with like wings an stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:29:58 its not supposed to be an exact copy but i fixed the back winds for more manuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:33:36 thats what im currently doing
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 12:34:20 modifying it
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:52:43 
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:53:35 all the other propeller blades got blow off by fireworks that pre-detonated because of lag
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:54:52 yhea i lagged because my router is out and im using hotspots üóø
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:55:29 can anyone give me tips on making my wings better to max out manuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:55:52 Here is my plane how can i improve the wings
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:56:13 
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:56:52 i want more manuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:56:54 and lift
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:57:26 ill give up ma speed
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:57:38 its all about manuverability
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:57:46 but where should i put the control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:58:01 but it dosnt have firework launchers which are very good
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:58:28 i prefer firework launchersa
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:58:40 they are literally flak guns
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:58:57 place them right and your fine
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:59:03 i also am not very laggy
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 13:59:28 when my router is plugged in (my dad took it for some reason)
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:00:04 and other planes
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:00:12 oh noes
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:00:25 but it dosnt have firework launchers
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:00:55 they almost never hit
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:01:02 even with propeller planes
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:01:19 its very hard to aim
