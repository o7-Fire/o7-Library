plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:15:18 im trying to build a helicopter but it keeps just swinging around uncontrollably
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:15:23 how do you make a stable one?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:26:03 im trying to build a helicopter but it keeps just swinging around uncontrollably

how do you make a stable one?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:34:59 not spin
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:35:10 i already solved that by making a second, opposite spinning rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:35:14 i mean SWING
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:38:36 im trying to build a helicopter but it keeps just swinging (not spinning) around uncontrollably

how do you make a stable one?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:54:52 im trying to build a helicopter but it keeps just swinging (not spinning) around uncontrollably

how do you make a stable one?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:20:05 you mean where you have a second motor on top that spins in the opposite direction, twice as fast?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:22:35 yes i do use that
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:22:47 it swings around like a 3d pendulum
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 01:23:01 especially when i stop midair
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 22:53:10 how do you stabilize a helicopter? i got mine to stop spinning by adding a second rotor that spins in the opposite direction, but it keeps swinging around like a pendulum
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:54:28 I SOLVED MY PROBLEM WITH THE HELICOPTER
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:57:26 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:57:54 i used helium and ballast blocks to keep the up side up and down side down, so i can avoid swinging around wildly
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:59:29 its not used to make it go up
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:59:45 its used to substitute horizontal and vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 22:00:43 i have a pretty good tech demo going on my stream

plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:44:22 how do yall make a plane that can hover in place and change direction with the mouse?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:45:25 no i mean like the fighter jets that do that
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:45:54 i know what a shredder bug is, i was making "fish" very similar to them a couple weeks before the first youtube tutorial was uploaded
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:46:39 oh  well
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:46:41 that kills it
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:47:05 sounds super inconvenient to control such a precise plane with different keys
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:52:10 im thinking propellers
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:52:27 propeller blades* to give it the hover-in-place effect
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:52:43 it will also hopefully provide enough resistance for it to steer horizontally
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:53:08 aw hell yeah it works for the most part
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 18:54:57 hold on ima go up in jet stream because this is dope af

plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:02:40 nevermind then, someone decided to join and overwrite all my songs to play theirs
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:11:21 this is my current tech demo though:
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:11:28 
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:11:59 the blades at the bottom flip to vertical, allowing me to control which direction its facing with my mouse
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:13:02 when it flies normally, they switch back to horizontal  so it doesnt make the plane tumble
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 19:23:19 im thinking about adding a servo to the engines so they can flip down and prevent it from falling while hovering

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 01:46:46 <#384025409945337856> all of these except the copterstick were built for pvp. the ones with cutters can really shred through some kamikaze carts
creations-chat 2020-12-29 01:47:16 https://streamable.com/70fi4a copterstick tech demo video
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 01:48:15 was uploading my experimentation and refinement with cutters, my favorite pvp weapon
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 01:48:41 and my convenient solution to building a simple helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 01:49:38 both the copterstick and copterbot had ballast blocks on the bottom set to 10x density to counterbalance the helium blocks on top, so they wouldnt flip infinitely or spazz out
creations-chat 2020-12-29 01:50:21 https://streamable.com/ahpbzk copterbot (my baby) video showcase
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 01:51:31 also tooti must be some kind of expert at downplaying the effort people put into building things
creations-chat 2020-12-29 01:56:05 the copterbot in particular took a shit ton of tweaking, along with me coming up with the copterstick concept specifically for it, in order for me to actually build it. my original goal was to just build something like ROBOT that could fly semi-legitimately
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:05:24 dont make one that actually walks. its cancer
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:05:46 its like playing QWOP but harder because its 3D and roblox physics
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:06:20 some heelies or rollerskates go a long way
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:06:38 i do realize that yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:07:02 i make mine for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:07:23 pvp is the driving factor in 99% of my builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:07:54 only my oldest build wasnt motivated by pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:08:48 which is why i used helium/ballast to make the top lighter and bottom heavier
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:09:06 being balanced doesnt matter if roblox physics screws you over and decides "oh hey ima just flip"
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:09:49 but that doesnt entirely apply to water ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:09:59 you can brace yourself against the water
help 2020-12-29 02:17:28 i need some help in jetstream
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:18:32 need some help in the jetstream
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:18:47 trying to build a relatively big jet that actually looks decent
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:18:54 which i havent done in quite a while
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:20:45 its not a jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:39:51 based tie fighter
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:40:18 i made a tie fighter and so far its the best strafing fighter ive ever used in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:48:22 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:48:26 just got done with my big jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:48:40 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:50:12 <@456226577798135808> whats wrong with it?
creations-chat 2020-12-29 03:51:26 none of them are shitposts. the ones i posted before were just old things i made in my save files, this one was just made on stream
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:51:52 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:51:59 perspective didnt do the nose justice
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:52:55 better?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:53:51 its not supposed to be a passenger jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:54:13 its supposed to be a small military transport jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:37 i see
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:52 its supposed to bulge out in a sort of spherical shape?
creations-chat 2020-12-29 03:58:37 theyre bad to you. finding all the wedges to make the perfect shape is incredibly difficult, and most of the robots i posted took a lot of effort to get in that shape, except the tech demos, which were proofs of concepts
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:00:42 so basically, if its big enough to brute-force a curved shape through sheer size, its good?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:04:23 this good?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:21 i think it looks better compared to the old one
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:40 the old one had something missing from it, and i think this addition adds the missing thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:08:34 ah well
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:08:39 mine looks  cool and flies good
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:08:56 thanks for helping me make it look even cooler
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:09:50 thats a supersonic fighter
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:04 but jesus christ thats nimble
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:24 anyways my plane is supposed to pass the ranking test
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:40 so no custom control surfaces sadly
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:51 jets epic af tho
creations-chat 2020-12-29 04:20:59 Big Jet V1.1 changed the nose cone to look better https://streamable.com/a56nqb
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:22:08 also that jet tight as hell
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:24:12 makes me want to try using custom control surfaces to make my own jet that goes really fast and turns really tight
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:24:48 4/10 diamond-shaped cross-section
bot-central 2020-12-29 20:18:13 rank?
bot-central 2020-12-29 20:18:18 RANKED
bot-central 2020-12-29 20:18:20 pog
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 20:18:32 finally got my rank!
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:22:21 i need some help with custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:23:17 i got it to pitch pretty well, but im having trouble with roll and yaw
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:23:47 rn im trying to make a tech demo, which means it doesnt matter how it looks as long as the concept works
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:23:50 i did that
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:24:08 is it supposed to be servos?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:24:19 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:24:28 gn
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:25:16 i was using mouse controls
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 23:47:35 i made one that works alright
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:01:56 1x0.9 blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:02:29 fair
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:03:27 lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:56:48 lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:58:45 its best to just place a bunch of tiny water props instead of placing super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:59:08 woah
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:59:21 have you seen the pvp meta?
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:59:41 its just explosives
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 00:59:51 as many explosive balls as possible
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:00:15 either that or cutter blades so you can just slice through the explosives and hopefully hit the player
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:01:48 trap them and use a servo door to drop them
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:01:52 IRL style
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:07:29 the fastest plane is just maximum helium blocks. bad part is it can only go up
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:08:26 <#609442446249820211> talks about requirements for rockets and mentions speeds
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:08:38 ~800 is enough for rocket rank II i believe
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:08:51 i think its a decent comparison
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:09:14 so 800 is a fast plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:36:38 makes me want to make my own thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:41:33 BEHOLD
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:42:30 it flies pretty well
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:42:45 probably one of the dumbest ideas ive built that actually work
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:45:34 i thought about adding propeller blades, but that would make the rotation mechanism too useful
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:49:00 :O
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:49:03 great idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:58:18 ok so the one i just posted is propeller plane^2
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 15:58:27 i made a propeller plane^3
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 16:11:54 if a build flies well, and it accomplishes one of these things (looks cool, is funny/amusing, is realistic, is complicated/impressive, is effective in pvp), then i think it is worthy of upvote
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 16:11:59 unless its a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 16:13:04 a couple weeks before shredders became big (also before they were known as shredders), i made some that move around like fish swimming in the air
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 16:13:52 i called them "fish"
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 16:14:04 they did pretty well against conventional shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:36:52 i present to you...
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:36:58 the mobile AC unit
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:40:33 i wanted to make something that follows your mouse with motor 2s, but i didnt want to copy shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:40:49 it flies with difficulty
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:44:28 but it can swim
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 04:45:07 playing hostile skies b like
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 21:56:50 how do you turn a custom control surface plane?
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 21:56:58 do you roll first or yaw
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 22:00:22 how do you make compact custom control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 22:00:41 mine are all ugly and spaced out
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 22:16:04 if i put them any closer they will stick to each other
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:45:02 has anyone found a way to "toggle" wing panels so they dont provide any lift/drag?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:46:55 wym trap doors
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:47:50 how would that allow you to toggle wings on and off?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:48:42 o
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:48:58 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 17:51:42 im trying to make a plane transformer
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 18:04:21 what ddoes superstrength do in magnets
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 18:07:23 just found out
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 18:07:29 it makes magnets weaker lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 01:17:21 i want to build a cool looking jet that goes very fast using motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 01:17:37 i think ill do a tutorial first so i can wrap my head around the process
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 02:41:26 modded a jet tutorial to minimize in-flight dip after i used it to learn about motor locking :)
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 02:41:44 tutorial: https://youtu.be/NSxrYfvIthI
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 19:53:49 further modded the tutorial jet to make it look more like the American F-35A, and to perfect its flight stability
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 19:58:38 how so?
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 19:58:55 i modeled it off of https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/F-35A_flight_%28cropped%29.jpg/1280px-F-35A_flight_%28cropped%29.jpg
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 19:59:31 <@!761747674696515615> practice sculpting with wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 20:07:01 my most effective weapon against shredders is a cutter sword
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 20:15:50 in-line guns and good aim
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 18:55:31 what pattern works for motor locking?
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 19:13:13 got it
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 19:13:17 all it was missing was cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:36:40 i wish they did a spinoff or something with the 3d atmosphere plugin that space sailors uses
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:42:20 like actually going up into the exosphere with a rocket, or breaking the sound barrier in a rocket plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:19:47 were cutters nerfed? my swords are doing shit dps
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:22:56 wym "good" swords were the most fun weapons in the game
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:23:03 now its all guna nd missile spam
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:41:11 how does "core tech" work
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:42:56 this guy was flying around a huge ship with practically no wings, hovering in midair, and when i asked about it, he just said it was "core tech"
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:47:01 no i dont mean like stopping in one place, i mean hovering while turning the ship and shooting at stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 18:47:17 the entire thing behaved like a shredder bug, except it was massive
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 19:01:34 oh its just hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 19:03:50 holy shit this is exactly what i was missing
plane-crazy 2022-02-09 19:49:36 wait this doesnt work
creations-chat 2022-02-22 04:05:43 its so i could put half wedges on the side of the body to make it look more aerodynamic. plus, it looks cool
creations-chat 2022-02-22 19:59:07 shut up asshole
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:05:03 its <#504436696021204992> not <#384025409945337856>-be-a-jerk. you offered no feedback, no actual criticism, just "your build looks shit."
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:10:43 wym "example" lmao, i just called you out for being an ass, and judging by your response, you are
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:19:46 damn you played the "youre mad lol" card. guess youre better than all of us.
