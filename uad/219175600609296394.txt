plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:14:11 hey
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:15:11 im making a rocket but doesnt seem to work to well : its always offbalanced and favours one side though its the same all round (eg simetrical)
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:33:46 key control???
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:34:02 i guess.... can u even have mouse control?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:43:34 wait they mouse control always?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:43:38 0.o
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:44:00 with my rocket idk how to control it .. like i can get it to go up but not like sideways etc
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:49:43 u cant just use mouse control for control surfaces... not effective enough
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:50:06 yeh
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 13:50:38 is there a quick way to paste controls?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:20:18 warp drive?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:40:37 when u realize what you have done..... welp  to late to remove it now
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:42:55 it kinda looks like one of those separatists ships from the back on star wars?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:43:13 wait why does that gun have a spring on it :
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:48:26 wut does suspension actually do? it works well or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:48:39 also i swear magnets and pistons have no use????
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:50:45 wait wut....... theres piston and magnet cannons?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:53:26 im making a ship which currently gonna be 22 in length
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:53:33 and 8 in width
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:53:46 (when i say ship i mean plane : not boat xD)

plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:39:32 rockets are more powerful than jet engines but cant reverse
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:57:24 can magnets deflect bullets?

plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:03:04 also.. was that half wedge block u used on the top next to the motor
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:03:36 got this fast so far.... getting faster doe
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:04:08 i guess yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:04:17 for the wings i defo see a slot
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:05:06 i see that but... idk how it would work idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:05:08 lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:05:16 my mind cannot visualise it completly
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:05:59 its vertical
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:06:20 im now at
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:07:23 it would be helpful if u could... cus i wanna try make a venator (star wars space ship) and doing this would be very helpful... so i could make it longer
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:08:04 wait btw... did the heli carrier fly decently well... or nah cus of its size?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:08:47 160k plus?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:08:49 okay
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:08:54 im at 136k at the moment
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:09:32 thats decent :0
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:10:22 btw how do u make a decent motorbike without it falling slightly left or right... eg keeping it upright but still have it being very agile and moveable
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:10:54 oh yeah.... not the fastest speed but still pretty freaking fast
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:11:32 nope
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:11:42 not super rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:11:58 and thx
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:12:54 helium can be quite handy... first off. gets u going vertical... 2nd off.. this can mean your power delivery is 100% upwards... 3rd off... it also adds to power going upwards and has no limit to how fast u can go with it 😋
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:13:03 im almost at 200k now
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:13:26 ah... is it to help achieve lift?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:13:30 like make it hover
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:14:14 so the helium alone will not lift it... but makes it so u need less power to achieve lift/hover so therefore movement is easier, also using helium can result in the helicarrier being more stable (eg not tilting to side to side ?)
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:14:39 thx nobilis
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:15:29 imma try work on a venator now... getting help from mr professional heli carrier guy to help me make it better/bigger
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:15:46 true
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:15:51 its better than no blades
creations-chat 2018-11-14 21:20:07 😋
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:21:21 ah... i see... btw, u said u used pistons right??? what r pistons actually used for?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:21:34 lard???

plane-crazy 2018-11-14 21:54:26 oh my.... ive got a plan in what im gonna do

creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:12:02 i gtg doe, ill continue this tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:22:35 <@194241218811658240> what u can do like alot of people is make a system where u make your rocket into two seperate pieces then use motors and half blocks to move and connect them together
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:23:45 i havent seen a giant rocket yet doe... but thats what other big build creations do
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:24:30 .... to large prob
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:25:07 i swear it would cause some lag

creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:25:32 so not to many... prob 2k
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:28:18 <@163143541160148992> would creating an automatic reload rocket bullet cannon, count as a unique idea???? eg is it inventor worthy
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:28:54 oh my i just had another idea..... i can make it have two magazines!
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:29:35 ah
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:29:41 rips
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:32 wut u could do if it was 2 wide... make a disconnector and make the magazine go into the gun upwards... so use gravity... to load the gun
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:51 thats what imma try
creations-chat 2018-11-14 22:30:58 idk

creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:54:13 mr missle rocket thing is a fail... mainly cus i need blocks which connect one side but do not connect to other blocks on the other side but are smooth unlike wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-16 20:58:14 there must be a new wheel system... because this never happens... when i  want it to go left... all wheels point right which makes it move right (it doesnt even make it turn) ... half of the side is suppost to be the opposite direction....

bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:17:51 rickje.... do u know how to do this... robo doesnt so ;/ i dont...  do u?? basically the motors are suppost to pull this hatch open.. however i cannot fill in those holes without it connecting to something else... hence there is gaps
creations-chat 2018-12-02 17:19:23 <@163143541160148992> dude do u know the guy who built the escape pod for the consular class cruiser (from star wars)

bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:22:39 but i cant put anything where the gaps are ;/
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:23:00 cus if i did it would weld to something... but theres no blocks to replace the blocks beneath it to make it not weld so i cant do anything bout it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:23:10 i just made a side door instead.. its easier
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:25:20 rickje... can u make a block that only connects together from  two points length wise... what i mean is with the block u can make a doors open which are only 1x in width...
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:27:25 eg... i want to make this into two seperate doors so the blocks in the middle open outwars... so Block: Block which opens left (door) : block which opens right (door) : Block...... we cant currently do this as blocks dont only connect vertically but connect to atleast one horizontal block, (sideways)
bug-reports 2018-12-02 18:47:41 engines aint working... idk why.. no anchor blocks or anything which will make it not work but they not moving at all

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:48:37 <@!469155500026494977> u got more than one anchor block? u only need one
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:48:58 k
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:50:13 its a bug with motors and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:50:37 since its connected to the block it registers it as anchored but if it moves then it bugs i think so then forces the script to register it has unanchored

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:13:22 G force is gravity ... against gravity or with
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:14:01 g force is multiple of grav basically due to speed going towards gravitational pull/against.. eg 2g is two times earths grav i think...

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:03:14 its a bug im guessing

bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:04:37 https://streamable.com/01a8u motor  randomly stops (happens alot) and idk why... it has the spinning wheels which has wedges in the middle which spin aswell then next to that is a big wheel which is 0.9x1 blocks so should allow the smaller wheel to spin perfectly... idk
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:06:43 k ty

creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:38:32 hello everyone
creations-chat 2018-12-20 17:43:33 hey 111d11111 ... a lot of 1's
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:00:39 im looking at the mod application... the multiple choice questions ... the answers i would phrase differently as something i would do is not there (which is better than what i have choices of)
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 18:01:24 mhm
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 18:02:07 with mod application for multiple choice questions ;... im not happy with the answers that u can choose from eg.... some of them i would do two and combine them however, u can only choose one...
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:12:15 0.o... does it actually work inferno
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:18:06 cool 😃

creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:38:29 doom idk
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:38:43 in two weeks i guess????
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:39:16 and rip doom... was it a good y wing???
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:39:21 <@!484363661121421332>
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:45:46 dang rip doom ;/ btw how big was it???
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:46:00 i mean how big was your y wing
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:47:50 dang 😦
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:47:53 that sucks
creations-chat 2018-12-20 18:50:17 ik a solution to overwriting saves, there should be a button to load previous server saves eg.... if u overwrite something big in a server .. u can load all your slots from previous server (so anything u added in the server u currently in will not save... so big creations wont get removed if u accidently removed it)
creations-chat 2018-12-20 19:17:39 or a third confirmation... so loads u click load and then confirm... saves.... u click save then u say confirm and then it says ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SAVE?
creations-chat 2018-12-20 19:18:27 i wonder how good this game would be if it was rescripted
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 19:21:35 😋 ??

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:13:02 imperial can u help me do dis fold without exposing anything on the sides when it folds?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:26:14 guys is the reason for this motor not turning properly is because  half blocks have full block hitboxes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:27:53 turbo or anyone how can i make my malevolence fold and have nothing exposed when theirs 4 air blocks distance... and half blocks have full block hitboxes so cant do what i orginally would do which would work ;/

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:29:33 inbetween
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:30:01 rickje... will half block hitboxes be half blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:30:03 in the next update?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 20:30:36 <@!221496030355521536> doesnt fold cus half blocks have full block hitboxes

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:34:15 cus i have no clue
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:36:20 ;/
help 2018-12-22 21:36:54 1Asakura  knows
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:37:38 <@!217336009455566848> since no one else is as skilled as u 😃 how do u fold something in which has 4 air blocks between it...
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:37:52 and have them connect to eachother
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:38:13 i have a reason to... because no one else ccan help me so rickje is the final straw
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:38:43 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:39:23 connect the one on the end of the other... but no gaps between
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:39:30 and yeh fold
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:39:42 i tried and failed...
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:41:59 rick i dont want anything sticking out...
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:42:26 i tried doing it 😃 kinda worked kinda didnt.. it folded ish but only half (the middle of the fold) so it didnt make it align
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:42:43 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:43:23 today when i went ice skating i was t posing 😃
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:46:38 rickje theres one problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:46:55 the side when folded will have to be flush like half blocks ;/
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:46:57 basically
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:47:06 i mean except the motors / half block wedges
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:48:06 this is stage one.. the fold is then what i have in mind.. split into two so the fold then connects the two sectors together (when the fold splits into two... it folds in the ship so wont be visible)
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:50:23 Rick its way harder than it looks btw
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:50:31 and nice grab
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:51:35 its to hard 😦

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:59:24 <@!217336009455566848> any progress on the mechanism or itto hard ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:03:36 Guys is anyone able to make a fold which folds in half when it folds two objects together... so they connect (but the folds have a 6 block gap between sector 1 and 2... and motors are an 8 block gap)
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:06:14 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:06:50 this folds... but how to fold this in half ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:07:54 <@!217336009455566848> yeh?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:08:22 <@205404956759556096> its harder than it looks...

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 22:15:36 rick can u join the offical vip and show me it in action?
help 2018-12-23 12:12:42 RICKJE i found a way to do the folding perfectly... i havent tried it yet but the idea i have in my head will work... it uses pistons... just 1 or 3 if want to make it look better. **Are pistons fixed and working so they dont bug out the plane???*** also can u make half pistons for half blocks?? ty
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:21:49 heya
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:37:50 @rick .. can u pls fix pistons

plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:45:01 i got 19 tril
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:45:16 thats 1000x lightspeed travel
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:45:32 no its not
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:45:36 bil is 9 zeroes
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:45:39 tril is 12
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:46:00 that is 1.9x10*13 eg 13 zeroes... so 19 plus 12 zeroes eg 19tril
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:46:04 quint is 15 zeroes (zeroes meaning numbers after the first number)
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 13:48:17 😃

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:46:12 do magnets weld properly to eachother.... or they still buggy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:47:17 weld meaning join and cant unjoin
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:47:19 eg lock together
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:47:35 does it actually weld?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:47:55 cus with my spaceship... the only way i can do is use magnets to weld it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:48:40 all motor and other contraptions have failed.. well they succeed some of them but glitchy af and break all the time and take forever to join and etc..... all negatives... (they dont actually join the contraption together properly either so... i have last resort is magnets)
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:53:21 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:53:24 this is that master piece im trying to join
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:53:42 ppl have tried... failed cus of one thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:54:34 cus.. a lot of them forget about this... and due to it u cant fold using a normal motor fold
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 21:55:26 i tried using pistons... worked if pistons actually work properly and if motors turn properly with large creations... but pistons+motors dont work

creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:21:34 true
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:22:10 ive never done a single tutorial
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:22:43 i mean i looked at the folding one... but it didnt help cus it was just teaching basic folding which i knew already
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:23:10 yep
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:24:29 its just novice technician... so its not a biggy
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:25:33 i mean if he was copying something for a rank which is like the top for that section then yeah i would deny his right to get it.. but since its the first one in that section... hes still learning so for the next rank he will have to make something on his own but maybe using the concept of the previous one that he copied 😃
creations-chat 2019-01-03 17:25:47 anyways i gotta build the bottom of my malevolence
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 17:29:54 0.o

plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:39:12 btw does anyone know if.. there is gonna be something to prevent accidental overwriting of saves.. eg to restore previous server data or... ability to lock saving? until u wanna save something and unlock ;/?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:40:32 yeh, but will it be added? soon?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:40:48 idk, rickje is online
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:40:52 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:40:58 i didnt make my venator again
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:41:06 
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:41:11 i made a malevolence
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:41:23 i currently got two saves of it doe...
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:41:43 however its 130k save data each so ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:42:34 i dont wanna accidently overwrite it like i did to my venator... cus this malevolence is bigger by like 2k blocks (if all beams were blocks)
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:42:38 and rips
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:42:59 how big was your f zero blue falcon? cus i dont remember it.. or u got a screenie of it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:47:15 propellor engines is to easy
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:56:36 WElding on magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:56:39 does not work properly
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:56:46 yes it welds but not in the right place ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:58:14 i made a y wing
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:58:37 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:58:41 i have a malevolence as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:59:40 no crazy
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 20:59:44 it lags to much
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:01:36 <@!293508335443902465> go bio's priv server, 2nd one from the top
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:04:35 jekeri?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:04:42 what cant u fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:01 oh that...
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:05 thats easy to fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:11 just use basic folding
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:15 so???
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:21 huge things doesnt mean u cant fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:29 jekeri
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:31 i could do it
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:44 it would be full width... then 3 base lengths
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:05:51 or 4
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:06:06 and jekeri.. yes there are
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:06:27 theres about 60 keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:07:15 Rickje... can u fix magnet welding??? magnets get pulled together... then when they weld they bounce back and this happens... they form gaps :
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:15:31 <@!280026855782744064> it was 4500 blocks including beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:15:48 lmao?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:16:39 one
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:16:49 its hard to make a bigger venator and fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:16:52 cus of the bridge
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:21:00 Jekeri
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:21:05 u cant do it to scale
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:21:32 u have to do it to like 1/10000 scale... to actually fit it inside the build zone
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:25:39 I just made my y wing completly balanced now 😛
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:27:37 no... bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:27:56 hehee... good idea but i dont want 200 tnt dropped on my face
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:31:29 nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:41:28 making a perfect vtol is hard
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:44:28 YAAAS
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:44:32 i made a perfect vtol
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:45:54 what that means is... it lifts up perfectly without moving forwards or backwards... then when engines are turned off it falls downwards without moving forwards or backwards.... its so hard as mass and engine power need to be overall the same
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:47:31 perfect hover?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:47:40 farollo..... if i try do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:47:49 i will have to change the mass and everything again 😦
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:47:57 and recalibrate it 😦
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:48:17 have u made it have perfect hover?

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:56:48 i ment... making a perfect hover*
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:57:28 making a perfect vtol hover which is perfectly balanced is hard
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:59:03 yep no.. i give up on making this balanced... vtol and hover 😦
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 21:59:04 to hard

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:03:49 Imperial
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:04:34 and i need novice pilot .. skilled pilot and ace pilot rank
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:04:50 and ty 😃
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:04:58 btw all the proof is above in chat
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:05:25 they are for different things though 😃
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:05:42 ty doe
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:06:08 i have offically got 2 ranks left till i got all the ranks 😃
creations-chat 2019-01-13 09:31:25 Lol
creations-chat 2019-01-13 09:32:03 And thats why magnets lag you.... they spam commands in which in affect does nothing but use more cpu which increases lag :/
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:16:30 does welding on magnets not work anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:16:57 cus i tested it and it doesnt
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:28:58 imgur is a gif site i think
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:29:21 <@!280026855782744064> i told u before... i cant use folding unless pistons and motors are fixed
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:33:42 that doesnt make sense... a 1x1 wedge is different to a 4x1 wedge ..... to reduce lag it would need to be a 4x4 wedge
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 18:33:49 ..
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 19:54:41 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 19:55:09 <@511080180966752256> cannons look cool
creations-chat 2019-01-14 18:49:57 <@!221496030355521536> ..... someone made a malev aswsell?? msg me about it :
creations-chat 2019-01-14 18:52:57 i see

creations-chat 2019-01-14 18:53:43 he has a decent design doe 😃
creations-chat 2019-01-14 18:54:16 except his scaling is a bit off.. but not 100% sure cus its not a side angle, good attempt by him doe :
creations-chat 2019-01-14 18:54:21 anyways gtg
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:22:11 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:22:25 1x3 and 1x4 triangle wedges hitboxes aint fixed yeet
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 20:22:52 dont think this is ment to happen
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:33:33 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:33:43 magical engineering?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:39:37 wait empire u trying to built it? with all its functions?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:39:48 thats gonna be challenging
creations-chat 2019-01-20 09:42:55 <@256501003493441547> decent attempt at consular claas cruiser.. can u send rear view pic of it (of the engines basically)
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:44:29 dang
...
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 09:44:39 clever
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:42:59 great ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:43:05 welding still laggy and buggy (with magnets)
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:43:29 when i did the weld.. my fps dropped by more than half ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:43:35 rn on 3 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:45:21 well ... was on like 14
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:45:29 im now on 10 fps now..
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:46:49 when welding my 2nd section... i go from 10 fps to 3
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:46:53 make that 1.8 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:46:55 still dropping
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:47:02 1.2 fps;
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:47:15 magnets... laggy
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:47:29 i cant use normal folding till motors/piston lock is fixed
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:47:36 but i cant use magnets... till they fixed eitehr so 😛
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:21 when i finish welding my 2nd section.... i get 3 fps overall
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:23 i did rickje
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:36 4500 including beams
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:43 7500 individual blocks if no beams used
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:45 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:49:57 so its a big creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:50:26 i think i would have like 6 fps if no one else was in the server but  there are so 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:50:49 
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:51:34 btw magnets really do needa be fixed not only due to the lag ..... but due to welding cus : this is how it welded... its got a full block in height difference and in length (eg.,. not supposed to do this)
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:52:24 0.o
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:52:32 when i move my ship i lag less than when i dont
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:54:58 😋 ty
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:56:45 erm a long time renegade
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:56:49 also its not done yeet
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:57:11 i cant make it fly till  magnets are fixed... or motors/pistons (so i can actually fold it/weld it)
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:57:19 so can only do design basically
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 17:59:01 Renegade... face my fleet of 1 malevolence
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:35:52 because
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:35:54 patrick is better
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:36:14 its not
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:36:44 inferno does it all the time... it depends doe, if they do it intentially to  try crash the server then yeh
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:37:04 people call it the kraken
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:37:28 eg... a bunch of rope
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:37:44 wait that guy used  suspension?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:37:50 interesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:38:11 inferno uses rope
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 18:38:24 anyways gotta do hw so imma go do it

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:20:12 lag is defo better with magnets 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:21:51 btw... when joining magnets.. its laggy af
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:21:53 i get 1 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:22:07 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:22:12 what mode?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:22:28 okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:22:32 magnets have a problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:22:44 when they align perfeclty now .,.. they dont weld.. but if they dont they weld :
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:23:46 wait nvm
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:24:44 yeh... welding doesnt work so well??
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:24:54 for magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:25:28 what does anti lag do?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:26:28 time to test if anti lag works ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:26:47 u got an AC-130?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:26:48 dang
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:30:30 thats sh#t
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:30:40 its like impossible to weld magnets now 😛
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:30:44 they just dont weld 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:31:47 Boy...
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:31:54 u know how to weld magnets>> cus they just dont weld
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:15 yeh
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:24 anti lag makes my fps go down to 6 instead of 1 so
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:25 it works
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:28 ;/
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:32 tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:37 it didnt want to weld with anti lag off
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:32:56 yeh
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:33:00 to magnets only
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:34:23 and then when it does weld...
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:34:27 it welds really stupidly
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:35:29 wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:35:33 u cant send images here anymore?? Rips
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:36:07 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:36:27 wont let me paste it ;
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:37:12 is this even possible... to weld then magnets to unweld??? cus thats just what happened
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:38:09 after 5 mins of trying to weld .. no hope
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:38:13 before the update it took 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:38:20 except it welded wrong so ;/
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:47:28 Magnets do not weld on large creations... if they do.. its very unlikely (like 10 minutes )
bug-reports 2019-01-27 15:49:31 even when u align it perfectly... it doesnt weld
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 15:55:06 kmhm
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 16:36:16 idk
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 16:36:17 btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 16:36:40 should i sacrifice part of my ship to make it be able to fold.. instead of using magnet welding?
bug-reports 2019-01-27 16:43:43 can u guys also fix motor and piston lock?
bug-reports 2019-01-27 16:43:47 because... they dont work
bug-reports 2019-01-27 16:47:47 first off.... motors are extended (they are locked in normal closed state so should remain that but no.... they dont ... and motors.. they locked yet they move (i have not pressed any keybinds btw except for rocket engines)  but the motors still move...
bug-reports 2019-01-27 16:48:59 this is how its suppost to remain (this is when i spawn it in>...) so, can u fix? (the lock feature not working has been like this for a while)
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:31:15 cool jailbreak
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 17:31:24 😋
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:11:00 i think i found a way to fold my malev 😛
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:11:08 with not using magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:11:54 canadian airlines
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:17:36 how would i fold this together... ive got a mind blank
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:18:13 no magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:18:24 i mean i have them there but i mean to fold it together.. using motors
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:18:41 and magnets... dont work to well
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:18:47 not right now anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:19:51 but i dont want motors exposed
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:20:29 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:24:36 this kid just called me a nub
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:24:38 twice...
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:24:44 make that three times
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:25:01 make that -inf-
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:26:07 
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:28:01 inferno... you have a brother in law
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:28:16 he names it the
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:40:01 idk how i can fold this ship... without motors sticking out
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:41:06 imperial u can...
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:41:48 cant see motors der.. folds well
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:42:31 but what i mean.. by sticking out is like you have a block.. air gap.. then block and u folding that together.. sticking out meaning that air gap has a motor .. dont want that
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:43:49 idk
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:08 idk how i would fold this without having a motor in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:16 its because its odd airgap in the middle.. so makes problems
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:23 ik that
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:42 dude
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:48 that only works if the air gap is even
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:44:55 which is not
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:45:17 
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:45:21 i think ik how to fix it doe
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:45:36 ill have to strip one layer off from one of them
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:45:52 magnets dont work well at the moment
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:49:30 time to fold this together
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:52:20 why am i getting 1fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:52:27 for my build
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:52:29 ..
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:52:53 no its not that
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:52:58 its normally 15 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:53:04 thjeres a defo lag bug
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:53:43 nows its 12 fps again
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:56:05 imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:56:12 why the hell is motor lock so laggy now .
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:56:20 literally...
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:56:35 i should have 12 fps but when i try to fold.. i go to 1 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 21:57:16 magnets arent on
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:01:23 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:06:31 <@456226577798135808> heres the malevolence fully folded
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:07:05 
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:07:24 im getting 8 fps 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:09:14 erm
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:10:31 i may have overestimated the length of the malevolence
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:10:32 😃
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 22:15:08 im gonna have to fix my malevolence later
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:42:04 :
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:42:41 my malevolence is to long 😃 mid section is.... (i dont think i need to explain it)
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:42:57 sausage 😃
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:43:31 i needa make the front bigger and reduce mid section
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:44:02 shoot...
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:44:15 i dont think my malevolence will fit...
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:44:29 its technically an island in itself
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:45:59 true 😃
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:46:19 Rickje, fix motor lock.... 😃

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:23:40 its not that hard to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:23:47 i just couldnt due to proportions
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:23:57 nope

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:24:20 slaba
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:24:26 what i have to do it literally remake it 😛
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:00 gotta push the ion cannon back... the bridge (front bridge not the back) backwards by 5 blocks or so... then remove part of my ship and yeh...
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:18 then recolour everything.. strip the top of the middle section to change it due to the shifting of the forward section 😃
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:27 i saw his outline modle
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:41 grab ik
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:48 he said... hes going for size rather than quality
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:52 quantity over quality
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:15 wait....
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:22 u said snokes ship???....
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:27 i dont know that guy then.....
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:37 ik a guy was making the executor?? i think.. the super star destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:40 really big and long
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:44 but thin
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:27:01 i ment executor*
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:27:14 kk robo

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:29:28 0.O
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:29:30 DARK_KAYN
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:29:40 i remember him 😋 hes the other dude who makes star wars stuff 😃
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:29:47 and the whale
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:30:51 how many bases wide was the supremacy
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:07 yeh
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:18 0.o 😋
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:32 tbh its pretty thin so thats do-able
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:44 thats cool
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:51 it would logically be even
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:31:57 not odd
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:32:14 because how i would do it... is not split it down the middle
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:32:33 i think its 6
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:32:40 3 on each wing (not one in the middle)
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:32:57 idk.. thats just how iw ould do it
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:33:50 0.o
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:33:53 so u did it that way
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:34:03 wait a minute...
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:34:15 wait nvm...
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:34:50 Slaba... if he did he would have to change proportions so.... technically he may not fit 7 with it being correct
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:34:58 :)... 0.o we thinking same mindset dark
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:35:14 sometimes the best things come in smaller packages
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:35:37 bai slaba
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:35:44 lol dark 😛 rips
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:35:58 and thats why u made it the size it is

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:23:54 guess whose back
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:37:04 ... well roblox just crashed when i unanchored my vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:37:25 nvm... almost* crashed... it froze for a bit doe
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:38:54 btw is folding still a thing in plane crazy cus when i loaded up my creation from a while ago and tried to fold it like i did before.. it just freezes me lel
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:39:13 and it wont move
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:39:35 well my game is crashing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:39:36 :
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:39:52 
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:39:54 my game just crashed
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:40:51 let me try again
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:41:51 game defo got more laggy if im freezing if i unanchor myself
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:42:35 yep... used to get 12 fps now getting 6 😛
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:42:42 or 0
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:42:56 sad times 😦
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:43:39 i havent even turned on the motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:43:50 
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:43:55 1fps.... and all ive done is unanchored myself
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:00 havent moved at all..
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:17 it gets better... 0.4 fps
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:35 well... motors and hoped they fixed the lock system
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:42 or... magnets
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:46 and hope they fix magnets lock system
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:44:56 0.3 fps
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:45:03 i havent moved at all..
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:45:08 and fps declining
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:45:28 0.2 fps
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:45:53 why game so laggy for some reason?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:46:30 so magnets have gotten 2000x more laggier?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:46:51 so the lag is so bad... it still thinks im in the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:47:05 never gotten that before
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:49:34 <@!118113664636157953> without magnets... still the laggiest thing ever ... not the magnets thats the problem
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:50:05 it did contribute a tiny bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:50:16 so i got 6 fps for a solid 10 seconds then froze again completly
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:50:48 because... u could be asleep?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:51:15 some people dont take that long
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:51:29 welp back to 0.3 fps
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:51:43 sure
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:51:52 which one is it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 14:53:07 wheres the link for it 😃 havent been here in a while so i see vip  server channel has gone..?

plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:27:32 they work but not moving two objects of equal sizee>>
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:43:01 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:43:05 are motors still LAGGY af?
creations-chat 2019-07-21 16:47:20 hey
creations-chat 2019-07-21 16:47:33 is this boi alright?? Malevolence
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:59:12 btw > is there any way to connect to sections of a vehicle together.. without any motors or magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:59:41 i mean instead of folding>
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:00:08 the nose can fold
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:00:45 i mean the other part of the vehicle.. if u have it filled to the area.. so your folding a sized object which is the same size of the object which the motor is on
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:01:04 except... im not using motors cus>> same object size = rip = broken = fix please
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 17:02:01 got to a million in spd due to just using motors... no enginees.. no magnets.. nothing.. only motors (all connected>> still part of one build.. no excess stuff .. no objects lost.. just motors) and yeah>> it was insanely broken
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:02:29 i had it finished ages ago
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:02:45 just havent played plane crazy in forever
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:02:56 <@!221496030355521536> it looks alright though.. it terms of proportion?
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:03:05 
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:05:01 idk what ya seeing.. but not a 747... in any way
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:11:54 better than before lol
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:12:11 btw i fixed it like 4 months ago.. just cba to post it
creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:16:50 should i remake my venator class star destroyere?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:19:08 idk if V0xelBox will see this.. but relating to what he said in <#504718138399522832> >> an aircraft by definition is: an aeroplane, helicopter, or other machine capable of flight.
**"or other machine** capable of flight" that qualifies spacecraft >> they capable of flight in earths atmosphere.. yes they may be "made" more space... but they can function perfectly fine as an aircraft>> this means spacecraft is allowed depending on the model but most spacecraft are used in earths atmosphere to then get into space... spacecraft=aircraft >spacecraft=in space >aircraft = in air... spacecraft can fly in air>> spacecraft=aircraft 😋
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:19:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:20:56 designed for space.. hence engines work in space.. aircraft dont fly in space cus engines are made for earths atmosphere (air) .. but spacecrafts function in earths atmosphere aswell.. so spacecraft=aircraft as works in air .>> logic? or do i have autism..
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:21:37 vtol<
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:24:10 also due to the size of spacecrafts (relating to star wars size) the effects of forces around it that would unbalance an aircraft.. which would then need to require support like wings for airplanes or... tail rotor for heli's.. but for giant spacecraft> vtol is good enough in which engines from either side of the spacecraft will fire to balance it and will be on at a constant rate>> eg> it flys in air.> aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:24:37 i maybe doing this cus i got nothing else to do..... debates can be fun
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:25:09 <@!251202211470770176> 1ASakuraA1 is the man to go to for helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:26:39 sakura made a his own washplate... and had a dual rotor
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:30:32 herobrine .... thats the only possbility to why.....
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 19:31:04 BOIS
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:29:28 hello
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:30:38 i see they changed and added ranks >< time to get em all >?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:32:37 first off.. not quite
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:33:00 VTOL engineer is ment to be VTOL master
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:02 Also ment to have Aeronautical master >< not engineer
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:30 hyperinventor?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:34:53 thats gonna be a thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:36:33 👏
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:37:29 btw does a spaceship which functions FULLY as a aircraft carrier <> allowed to get master shipwright (its 4500 blocks)... its a multi purpose vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:37:54 MOTOR FIXED??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:10 I am testing this right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:23 welp
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:38:35 let me screen record it fully and see if it actually is improved at all
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:39:47 Test #1
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:42:49 turns out its worse
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:43:02 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:43:13 my ship is all attatched... guess with motors it says nope
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:47:50 i would definitly say motors have improved though
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:47:53 they run much smoother
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:48:16 normally would take 5 mins MINIMUM to fold my ship<> took 2 this time
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:48:49 cus <> I do?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:49:54 rips my game still lags with this creation... 9 fps
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:50:02 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:50:12 looks fresh idra
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:38 <@!340543153922768906> i would say motors are generally fixed
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:41 and yes mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:51:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:07 I didnt work on it to make it fly yet cus motors were buggy constantly <> so couldnt actually hold together
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:16 but I guess i can start working on it 🙂 to make it vtol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:27 train?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:38 <> is just a paus Megal
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:42 pause*
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:52:49 and theres a train inside the malevolence??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:53:40 0.o that train mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:53:45 and no >< not enough space
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:54:26 <@!308156968550268928> freedom of speech :< soz if <> annoys you
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:54:49 <@456226577798135808> yes... if you mean me hehe
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:55:35 <@456226577798135808> inside isnt that big.. its 1/4 base width
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:55:59 btw should i make a star destroyer?
or just remake my Venator?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:56:34 C-90 ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:56:56 I was thinking that but a few have done so already
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:14 like>?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:32 nah> thats just a trap
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:45 nvm its a star wars reference
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:57:58 ITS A TRAP
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 18:59:21 what star wars ship should i do >< (not providence or lucrehulk.. providence u cant do cus base dimensions is just not tall enough for it.. lucrehulk, some people done it already and its kinda bland soz.. interior is good but exterior is oof)
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:00:17 show u how? how?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:00:58 secutor?? or executor ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:32 didnt know that existed 😋
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:50 i have
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:01:58 engines look fresh <> rest is pretty bland
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:02:09 its like snokes capital ship >> just big and flat
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:02:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:03:35 idk truely where i come from ... eh ive been called special and strange but truely.. what is the point in being normal and hidden when you can just be yourself fully ?>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:03:52 even if people hate it
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:05:26 anyways if u wondering where i come from .. im south african but raised in england... maybe thats why im so strange?? because south africans like to be upright and get to the point e.g. they say things straight as they are > whilst english they just polish and try be as polite as possible and go around the subject to make it as little rude as possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:05:42 maybe that mix just creates strangism > welp eh.. im happy
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:10:49 a problem ive found with motors is... if blocks are connected by motors.. the anchor will anchor the main body yet the blocks connected via motors will continue moving and only with a little delay be brought back to their right positions.. but sometimes they move so much in that delay that they get stuck inside the ships body
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:11:38 kk
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:12:46 rip my game crashed... somehow exactly on 420 sps though
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:12:49 coincidence??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:13:12 to much pot
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:13:36 nitro boosts only last a month i believe
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:16:02 how so>?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:16:32 not enough space or?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:01 I see
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:17 make the window just square then..
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:17:39 simples
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:22 time for me to change my malevolence into a vtol killing machine 🙂
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:29 and maybe a submarine for that rank aswell?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:54 it looks like a sub ish
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:20:58 with its body type
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:22:36 **when your F2P**
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:23:01 lol
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:23:05 argument forming??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:25:52 guys can i say one thing?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:14 just be quiet honestly... theres no point in talking about ebola and fighting honestly.. gets us no where
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:46 what does friction blocks do?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:26:55 adds friction? e.g. to slow u down or?
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:27:19 how does friction blocks make creation fly??
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 19:29:59 <@!340543153922768906> how do friction blocks work? been told to ask u about friction blocks cus u the man with (ab)using them
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:13:01 this can totally become a submarine !
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:43:17 
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:43:50 my ship is to boyant 😦
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:27 quedd idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:37 maybe , and legend yeah its been a while
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:43 way more than 4 months
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:46:46 like 6 atleast
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:48:48 y?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:51:38 Does this count as a submarine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 13:51:45 or a sinking ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:21 e.e im getting it closer to becoming a sub
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:26 but its so freaking boyant
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:00:38 especially the front
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:04:00 fonkl 👍
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:08:42 made a submarine 🙂
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:13:21 my submarine.. to actually work and make it dive.. required: 30 5x5 water properellors and about 100 super rockeet engines 🙂 (all facing downwards)... thats alotta boyancy
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:13:59 how so?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:14:19 so just adding a bunch of weight?
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:14:45 ballasts add the most weight <>
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:15:14 one sec
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 14:20:35 btw can i get submarine commander?

creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:22:48 😋
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:23:04 i converted it into a sub
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:23:09 gaining the ranks yah?
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:24:19 if it meets the requirements of what that thing is
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:24:25 so it has to be a rocket>> if its not then its not
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:26:18 Fully functional spaceship like submarine, with two underwater launchers capable of moving flipping other craft. 4500+ parts <> worth 10 upvotes?? you guys decide
creations-chat 2019-09-06 14:26:54 <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:44:36 SUBMARINE COMMANDER
SHIPWRIGHT [V]
VTOL MASTER [V]
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:47:41 ive got proof
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:47:50 one is in creation rn
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:47:57 well two* it qualifies for two
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:48:06 and VTOL master... i already had that from my venator
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:49:10 that qualifies for submarine commander and shipwright {V} (i got vid of it working.. i already posted it but can repost)
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:50:28 <@!255361087262818304> can i have thee ranks please master Kayn
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:52:11 tysm
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 15:52:22 ❤
bot-central 2020-03-19 11:11:02 !rank
general 2020-04-28 17:01:52 0.O
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 17:41:44 man i havent been here for a while
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 17:52:52 btw i love how motor lock is fixed and all. Motors seem good :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:16:28 meow
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:45:37 cheers :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:46:46 I would make a providence.. but the box makes it wayy to complicated to fit it in and all with its length and then the spires. Possible but i cba that life
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:46:59 i had a venator aswell but i deleted that accidently... literally 5 mins after i finished it. Cri
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:47:07 before confirming the delete was a thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:49:24 i may rebuild the ven..
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:49:44 definitely easier to control than malev cus of its width
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:55:43 btw just gonna say, control panels are real annoying still ;/
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:56:27 yeh imma do that now
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:56:40 imma set to keybind
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:58:46 who said we wanted to turn right :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:58:48 hehe
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 18:59:12 imma just set middle control panels for vertical or down... then outter be seperate
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:02:51 which is? roll is e q right?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:03:30 0.o
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:06:53 aight
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:07:00 all keybinds set
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:09:18 im a spec
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:09:39 forgot how physics worked.......
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:13:03 i have toooo many control panels but still cant get level lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:15:22 yep i guess control panels aint the way this boi gonna fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:16:58 rolling works just not vertically...
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:31:52 well
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:31:56 that happened
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 19:32:09 gotta love motors :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:14:00 ayy my malevolence flies and all now :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:14:02 like controllably
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:17:42 roborail 0.o long time :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:17:51 yeh i did 😂
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:18:00 i never got round to finishing cus motors were so buggy then
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:18:09 e.g. it took 15 mins to turn the parts and form the malevolence..
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:18:16 now its like 10 seconds cus they fixed it fully
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:18:23 so i can actually test it and make it fly 🙂
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:18:39 how you doing robo?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:43:34 optimising airships to be perfectly balanced... is a pain
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:45:33 but there is no 0 g 😭
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:46:28 0.o
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:46:34 since when!?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:48:39 waaa
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:48:58 wait is it like an option for 0 g?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:49:14 ....... swear it hasnt been since always
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:49:31 yeh that explains it prob
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:49:36 havent been here for ages 😂
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:49:58 last time i talked was
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:01 september 2019
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:05 before today..
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:07 so
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:11 ive been gone a long while
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:33 actually thas a lie.. i did !rank in march... just for that one command xD
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:50:47 activitiy was september or before
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:52:30 i got an issue..... plane tip goes forwards.. then back goes downwards and plane tips backwards when falling. No clue why it goes forwards first then backwards, doesnt make sense lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:52:34 explain the science of free falling
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:52:37 with weight
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:53:29 motors aint broken tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:53:30 :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:53:41 softcode?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:54:20 k i fixed it... its perfectly balanced now 🙂
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:55:20 because.... more = less ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 20:55:54 well, sounds like the man needs some aspiration :p
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 21:02:55 i 16 gb ram
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 21:03:06 soz flex ah
general 2022-10-01 10:53:59 The era that had passed 🥺 

Was good while it lasted. Still find it funny how the day i finished my venator i accidently deleted it 🤣
