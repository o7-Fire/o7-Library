plane-crazy 2019-05-25 05:37:30 ive reloaded 8 quadrillion times
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 05:37:39 ive restarted my computer 16 quadrillion times

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:04:45 <@!486674992981999648> i was
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:04:59 i thought it was the problem, so i took them off, and its still there
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:05:07 ROBLOX+
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:07:34 yeah, but i had dark+ for other reasons as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:07:47 and also, thats false, because it cant steal ur password
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:08:09 its by WebGL3D
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:08:11 they are trusted
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:10:01 it only displays notifications (like new catalog stuff) and reads and changes data on the site itself
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 06:10:16 meaning if it ***WERE*** dangerous, the whole site would be in danger
