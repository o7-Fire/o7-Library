plane-crazy 2021-07-11 03:53:30 is there a way to attach and detach 2 planes from each other because I want to make a glider attached to a tow plane, and I can't find anything on yt on how to do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 03:53:42 ty
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 03:53:45 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:32:11 if u place a pilot seet can other people sit on it and control the vehicle?
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:32:31 dang it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:33:11 i want to make a glider attached to tow plane that other people can control but nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:33:41 it works but its very small
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:33:50 and yea it stalls if the nose isnt pretty low
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:33:54 sucks
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:34:52 oh i know a way to make a glider i think but its not rlly a glider
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:35:05 use like a hover engine or something but weak enough so that it cant actually fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 04:35:20 still sucks that i cant make an actual glider
