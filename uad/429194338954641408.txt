help 2020-08-08 15:51:12 My Xbox keeps giving me error code 103 for Plane Crazy, I’m not under 13 and it shouldn’t be giving me problems with the NAT code as I wouldn’t be able to join any games at all.. is this game not allowed on Console?
help 2020-08-08 16:07:41 Thank you very much 👍
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:05:54 LOL
help 2020-08-10 02:39:44 Speaking of breaking the game, I had a very complex creation but had to dumb it down a lot due to springs and ropes and suspension clashing so much that my creation would freeze completely but I could still jump out of it and watch others and I had no lag or connection problems, just wondering if the issue was caused by all three together or too many of just one individually?
help 2020-08-10 02:44:04 (and yes I tried it in my VIP server lol)
help 2020-08-10 02:46:46 Okay thank you lol
