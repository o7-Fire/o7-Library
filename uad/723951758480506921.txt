general 2021-05-09 10:32:37 im aware of that
general 2021-05-09 10:34:13 theres not really a point in that tbh i dont play overly needy games
general 2021-05-09 10:34:32 im just wondering if anyone else has the same problem becuase i only see it on plane crazy
general 2021-05-09 10:38:10 16gb ram intel core i5 9th gen
general 2021-05-09 10:39:29 it doesnt lag alot, i get a few lag spikes occasionally because my wifi is tragic, its the graphics problems
general 2021-05-09 10:39:56 60
general 2021-05-09 10:40:08 graphics as i said
general 2021-05-09 10:40:16 it looks like crap
general 2021-05-09 10:41:31 can you not copy paste into this channel or something smh
general 2021-05-09 10:43:53 i'll check Nvidia and stuff maybe its driver problems
general 2021-10-30 17:38:30 it might not be back for a few weeks yk

general 2021-10-30 17:41:19 oh this is because i do e girl trolling lmao
general 2021-10-30 17:41:26 idek who the character is
general 2021-10-30 17:41:38 also why does nobody notice that roblox isnt the only thing down
general 2021-10-30 17:42:15 war thunder, elder scrolls online, huge companies are having issues too
general 2021-10-30 17:42:19 grow up
general 2021-10-30 17:42:58 this one is correct
general 2021-10-30 17:43:13 no the community are the ones bullshittin haha
general 2021-10-30 17:44:16 yeah but honestly- its down and it will be for maybe a few weeks, people need to grow up and stop bullshittin about the game because its almost clear what is happening rn
general 2021-10-30 17:45:22 do you know what the cause of the outage is?
general 2021-10-30 17:45:33 no
general 2021-10-30 17:45:38 its not
general 2021-10-30 17:45:46 its likely a DDoS
general 2021-10-30 17:45:54 again its for trolling lmao
general 2021-10-30 17:47:12 so you can- thats not even bad language smh
general 2021-10-30 17:47:37 well they are running that off of a backup server
general 2021-10-30 17:47:59 they cant run the game off backup yet because they need to re-run all the transactions previously on the game
general 2021-10-30 17:48:06 and revert to a backup
general 2021-10-30 17:49:38 yeah, notice that the message only happened yesterday, the outage began way before that
general 2021-10-30 17:49:51 you cant say- tf is wrong with this server
general 2021-12-06 22:45:54 So this is the first conversation I join to
general 2021-12-06 22:45:56 Right…

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:02 does using a different kind of shredder to destroy other shredders only make me a shredder kid
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:42 it's not a tutorial shredder and it works entirely differently though
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:53 and i'm only using it to get rid of other shredders so surely it's not that bad?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:28:45 hesitant to share it because i don't want shredder kids actually copying it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:29:02 no embed perms lol aaa
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:30:10 ye sure
