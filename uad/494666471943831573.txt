plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:13:24 That would suck because you can’t see through it and you can’t swim

plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:14 I wanted to make it so my shuttle could spin
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:20 But it can barely turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:39 Yeah true
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:49 I used tons of wings on my shuttle
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:57 So it won’t turn because of that
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:03 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:13 My entire wings are wing panls
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:19 I’ll show you a pic
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:01 
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:28 I used motor locking to make the wings look like they are blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:38 And it causes TONS of lag
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:48 Even for my gaming laptop
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:53:05 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:54:27 When I fold the wings for a landing it looks like this

general 2020-11-05 15:54:11 Lol
general 2020-11-05 15:58:26 Yeah but my computer is like right next to the router
general 2020-11-05 15:58:38 My tv used to not glitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:59:15 How is my heli
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:59:23 It’s a Chinook
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:59:43 And it hovers without anchor
general 2020-11-05 15:59:59 It is wireless
general 2020-11-05 16:00:06 I use a laptop
general 2020-11-05 16:00:33 NO
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:01:29 It was spinning badly
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:01:49 That’s when I tried a different rotor tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:01:52 I’ll try single
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:02:10 And if I increased the blade length, they would hit each other
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:02:37 There is a 2 block space between them
the-dump 2020-11-05 16:03:42 Have any of you noticed that trump isn’t tagged on roblox but Biden is
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:19:18 I made it single blade and now it just goes backwards when I fly up and I do a nose dive when I try to fly forward
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:21:10 Mine turns left a little when I hover
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:26:14 Mine is a dual rotor
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:26:27 It easier for that
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:27:23 How do you make yours fly so well for a single rotor
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:28:28 I tried converting one of my helis to make it that propellor type but when I tried to go forwards or turn my heli would flip
creations-chat 2020-11-05 16:38:31 For heli technician can I use engines to make myself go forward and turn?
help 2020-11-05 16:41:40 For heli technician can I use engines to make myself go forward and turn?
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:48:26 No I meant like using prop blades
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:48:32 That made it less stable
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:48:43 Before it was wing panels and motors
help 2020-11-05 16:49:20 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:49:47 And for heli technician can I use engines to make myself go forward and turn?
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:51:28 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:51:43 Because I can hover without engines but I can’t turn or move without engines
creations-chat 2020-11-05 16:53:13 Use prop blades and control surfaces and you have to play around with the motor speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:54:58 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 16:55:26 My heli is 800 blocks and it wouldn’t look like a chinook if I made it turn using prob blades
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:01:07 8
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:01:10 I think
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:01:56 Is it easy to make a walking mech
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:02:05 O
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:02:25 How do you control the arms and legs
general 2020-11-05 17:04:57 8
general 2020-11-05 17:05:17 O it’s 9?
general 2020-11-05 17:05:26 And blocks are what density
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:08:36 I’m good at boats and subs
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:08:53 I’m ok at helis and planes
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:08:58 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:09:15 I only have one big boatthat I made like last year
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 17:09:24 I recently built a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:41:06 What are the densities of different materials
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:41:26 Because diamondplate is definitely heavier than default
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:56:52 Hm that’s weird
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:57:25 I made diamondplate proprellor a and they gave less lift than default material
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:58:01 They give less lift then
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:58:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:58:58 I’ll just stick to default
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:59:01 For my heli
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 01:59:09 It was the prop blades that I changed
creations-chat 2020-11-07 21:28:28 Can you just stop

general 2020-11-09 17:09:36 Idk
general 2020-11-09 17:10:14 Almost all planes have a rounded end
general 2020-11-09 17:10:35 <@!280393446114590722> add more detail on the sides
general 2020-11-09 17:10:53 And the stock doesn’t look like that

general 2020-11-09 17:14:57 It is limitless
general 2020-11-09 17:15:19 Yeah plane crazy isn’t the most physical game

general 2020-11-09 17:19:33 Hmm
general 2020-11-09 17:19:44 #Logic
general 2020-11-09 17:20:33 There should be block placers in plane crazy
general 2020-11-09 17:20:37 For bombing
bot-central 2020-11-09 17:21:31 ?suggest
bot-central 2020-11-09 17:21:37 How do I suggest
bot-central 2020-11-09 17:21:42 ?shelp
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:25:46 Wth is a rectangular zeppelin. Lol bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:27:12 You would configure it to place a certain block when you press the configured button
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:27:37 It would decrease lag in most explosive ball bombers as the balls aren’t rolling around in the build
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:27:44 But contained in the block placers
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:29:56 And you could choose for the block to be connected to a block it is placed on or if it is loose
general 2020-11-09 17:31:39 Dam that’s a lot
general 2020-11-09 17:31:54 NO
general 2020-11-09 17:31:56 Help

plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:04 How does it look like what
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:12 It looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:18 I would just change the camp
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:22 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:27 That’s what it would do
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:42 Probably be hard to make but I would like to see it
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:34:13 And you could choose the amount of blocks that it is holding
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:34:28 It would be 1x0.9 so blocks don’t stick to it
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:35:00 People could make 3D printers that actually built things
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:35:04 That would be cool
general 2020-11-09 17:35:23 Hhooollyy
general 2020-11-09 17:35:34 Where the wings
general 2020-11-09 17:35:41 In the Boeing xxx
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:36:36 You could easily make the zeppelin round by replacing some blocks with wedges
general 2020-11-09 17:37:28 Who thinks a block placers would be good in plane crazy
general 2020-11-09 17:37:38 This is what it would do:

general 2020-12-17 02:10:53 The projectile flies fast like guns

plane-crazy 2022-02-20 15:21:58 A
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:26:15 for mad scientist do u need to land all of the stages rightside up?
general 2022-02-20 16:27:03 for mad scientist do u need to land all of the stages rightside up?
general 2022-02-20 16:27:35 does anybody know?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:28:11 but i need to land them rightside up?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:28:21 i know it says 3
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:31:40 <@!495210490172014612> do they need to land vertically
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:32:10 it says land without flipping but does that mean all of the stages?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:32:18 I KNOW THA TPART
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:32:25 does it need to land vertically
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:32:27 or just land
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:32:53 dude i know what propulsively means
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:33:01 it means land it with rockets or something
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:33:08 but do i need to land it vertically
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:33:28 because my boosters are small and will fall over
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:33:40 
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:34:02 so im asking because i will have to change their design
general 2022-02-20 16:34:24 this is hot
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:34:33 dam
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 16:34:38 alr ill start working on that
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:24:45 For mad scientist do I need to land all three stages at less than 60 speed per second
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:25:04 Because that will be hard to keep track of
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:33:31 Yeah it needs to land straight up
But does each stage need to land at slower than 60 sps?
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:34:18 That’s unrelated
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:35:22 The rules need to be specified more
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:35:49 I’m not gonna complain tho, the less rules the better
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 17:35:53 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:45:20 Explain to me what the fuck this is
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:05 Wait hold up
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:10 Wait a minute
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:13 A helicopter???
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:25 That is insanely cursed
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:32 Too bad it isn’t a tank
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:36 That would be better
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:46:46 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:47:36 Yoo  what about a helicopter that is build to fly with the rotors on the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:48:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:48:20 Or actually making a tank chopper
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:48:39 Where the turret is the rotor
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:48:46 And the guns are on the rotor
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:49:15 I don’t have time for the contest cuz I feel like building rockets
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:49:56 Ooh I could make a rocket that flies using helicopter rotors
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:50:06 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:50:35 How many times was it flown irl
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:50:45 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:50:56 Why did they want a jeep that flew
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:51:37 A flying submarine
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:52:13 Omg a shredder bug with heli rotor <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:53:59 No defenses
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:54:40 The soldier isn’t protected and can’t even defend
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:55:16 Yo what
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:55:34 It’s a heli sticker that looks like the people who fly them
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 18:57:58 Please
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:25:29 That’s bannable
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:25:56 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:35:42 It’s a swat. That’s bannable
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:36:07 Although it is Buddhist, most people take it as the wwii German symbol
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:51:01 So for crazy scientist it says you can not use anchor blocks but you need to land it on a ship
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 20:51:10 Could I put an anchor block on the ship?
general 2022-02-20 20:51:40 So for crazy scientist it says you can not use anchor blocks but you need to land it on a ship
general 2022-02-20 20:51:49 Can you put anchor blocks on the ship?
general 2022-02-20 20:52:24 I will just slide off the ship
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 21:07:26 it means that gliding is possible
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 21:07:39 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:51:07 Yeah I don’t see trading creations happening
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:51:33 If it does, we better get pilot seats actually letting other players use them first
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:52:10 Like build copying
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:53:48 Or you could just make a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:54:20 I made a few
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:54:33 Yeah people don’t like building tutorials anymore for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:56:28 I think it would be funny meeting someone saying that when you were the one who made it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:56:51 Conveyor
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:57:02 And ladder
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:57:17 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:57:50 Use conveyor and ladders. That looks good
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:12 Tbh most of the tutorials I have made were kinda bad
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:31 My friend just made a rocket tutorial and the person who made the tutorial failed
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:43 I just told him to make his own cuz tutorials are bad
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:52 This is like his third time playing
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:58:55 No
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:06 Yo tank fish got destroyed so bad in starscape
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:19 If you watched any of their videos
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 22:59:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:17 I destroyed quite a few of tank fish ships
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:29 They thought they could win but they failed
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:38 Wdym it’s not possible to make an og stratos
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:00:46 My friend made an og stratos
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:04 Just don’t make the interior
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:11 My friend made a horizon
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:25 No
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:38 Wait maybe it was a halo
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:01:46 Yeah this was before the horizon so it was a halo
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:02:04 I could easily make a liberty
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:02:08 It’s just a brick
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:02:58 A blimp that drops bombs and can explode itself in close range
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:03:09 That’s barely anything
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:03:23 My blimp has 100 bombs on the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:03:56 I have 50 inside the blimp for kamikaze
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:04:20 Yes it is larger

plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:14:55 Don’t joke about it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:15:27 Still don’t joke about it
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:15:41 If my mom wasn’t sick on that day and stayed home from work, she would be dead
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:15:51 Just don’t say stuff like that

general 2022-03-13 02:01:55 I don’t know if I want more people, or bigger space
general 2022-03-13 02:02:24 Option 3: do both

general 2022-03-13 02:07:12 I’m a chad
general 2022-03-13 02:07:28 Yes it better be a square

general 2022-03-13 02:08:21 I need to be wide
general 2022-03-13 02:08:26 Dude no
general 2022-03-13 02:08:56 15 players and a square plot would be better. I chose 1 because who even needs 10
general 2022-03-13 02:10:03 I think 15 players and a square plot would be better
general 2022-03-13 02:10:43 <@406178669661257729> what if you increased all dimensions, but not by as much for option 2?
general 2022-03-13 02:11:00 Yeah we need more players, but I also want more space
general 2022-03-13 02:11:14 Thanks. Hehe
general 2022-03-13 02:11:24 But not width
general 2022-03-13 02:11:54 What about increasing all dimensions but not by as much for option 2
general 2022-03-13 02:12:10 Good point
general 2022-03-13 02:13:25 Some people build platforms
general 2022-03-13 02:15:20 If you want option 2, do option 2. This is your game, it doesn’t need to be democracy

plane-crazy 2022-06-23 15:38:15 Instead of going 3 months without any news
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 15:38:39 And it was the current planned release date 3 months ago

plane-crazy 2022-09-10 11:31:02 Remember this: When a game dev says that they will be releasing a game during the summer, they really mean that it will be released in the very last day.
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:15:32 What happens in that land your pfp speaks about
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 22:15:51 Do the Saxons have an empire?

plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:49:14 They stay off counters
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:49:37 Lol you gotta train them
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:50:09 I had a spray bottle when my cat went on the counter
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:50:31 And he learned
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:50:55 He also catches animals outside
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:51:07 Like bunnies and squirrels when they go into my garden
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:51:54 ^
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:52:12 You can be better off sometimes if you turn close tracking off
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 18:52:39 So the rockets don’t track that single block lying on the ground and not the target you are aiming them at
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 20:26:52 Beam 1x4
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 20:27:48 Yeah same. And my other cat follows my sister everywhere

general 2022-10-17 00:54:51 Whole refers to something in its entirety. Ex: I ate a whole pizza

Hole refers to a spot missing in something. Ex: butt hole
