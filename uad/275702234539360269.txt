plane-crazy 2021-03-30 18:53:18 what exactly does damping do on suspension?
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 18:55:02 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:21:01 use the motor to "fold" parts of your build into each other
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:21:25 i.e. break your build into parts and then put those parts together with motors
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:22:59 also very nice new mexico
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:29:52 oh yeah i should apply for those
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:30:34 oof, i figured
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:42:39 you want it to disconnect or not
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 19:59:12 don't burn yourself out - if you're not having fun building, take a break

plane-crazy 2021-03-30 20:07:28 get well soon
plane-crazy 2021-03-30 20:08:20 relatable
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 00:37:26 wonder what the holster looks like
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 02:23:03 what's the general consensus on those builds which solely exist to smack other builds around
creations-chat 2021-04-02 21:08:40 yeah not sure thats something you should be proud of

~~Technically they're too big but I couldn't get it any smaller~~
creations-chat 2021-04-03 23:51:54 What colour should I paint the tracks
~~Also how do I stop it from wiggling from side to side on the suspension~~

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 02:51:21 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 02:52:28 was my first use of motorlock + smaller builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 02:52:33 inside looked completely disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 02:52:59 
creations-chat 2021-05-29 18:01:45 <@456226577798135808> you mean Object 726?
creations-chat 2021-05-29 18:08:34 Right that's object 726, WG just decided to call it 279e
279 was developed with lessons learned from 726, but it was a different project
~~in fact they introduced 279e as 726 at first, but I guess giving it the ufo tank name made it more appealing or something~~
creations-chat 2021-06-03 14:22:29 <@!710260189496082504> 68 is upside-down, the front of the ship is always the "top"
