The Tale of laughingbudai (818315232669466665)
general 2023-01-18 23:01:01 Those aren't all the specs
general 2023-01-18 23:01:07 It has a GTX 1650
general 2023-01-18 23:01:19 Still a good graphics card for a laptop
general 2023-01-18 23:01:35 But nothing crazy
general 2023-01-18 23:01:41 Yeah
general 2023-01-18 23:02:03 Then again, 1650's are old graphics cards
general 2023-01-18 23:02:44 Laptops don't have good space or breathing, so it is bound to not have amazing specs
general 2023-01-18 23:03:28 4000 series is out but not needed
general 2023-01-18 23:03:37 4000 series would be dumb to get right now
general 2023-01-18 23:03:58 Why
general 2023-01-18 23:04:07 I have a 2070 for battlefield
general 2023-01-18 23:04:12 ðŸ˜­
general 2023-01-18 23:04:31 What
general 2023-01-18 23:04:39 Box thing next to a computer?
general 2023-01-18 23:05:22 Are you talking about the big boxes with components inside of them?
general 2023-01-18 23:05:33 Those are PC Towers
general 2023-01-18 23:05:36 That is the actual computer
general 2023-01-18 23:06:00 PC Towers are computers
general 2023-01-18 23:06:06 Laptops are computers
general 2023-01-18 23:06:12 Desktops need monitors
general 2023-01-18 23:06:27 I don't know if you want a Laptop running with a desktop
general 2023-01-18 23:06:48 Because all you'd be doing is using the laptop like a monitor
general 2023-01-18 23:07:31 No, it'll still work as long as they have a power cable and an HDMI cord
general 2023-01-18 23:07:50 Depends on the resolution
general 2023-01-18 23:08:30 I don't think they meant they were getting a case, I think they meant they were going to buy a full tower with components
general 2023-01-18 23:09:11 1920x1080 monitors are usually 150
general 2023-01-18 23:09:26 Which is a reliable monitor and good resolution
general 2023-01-18 23:09:47 Higher refresh rates are probably for later, they should just start with basics
general 2023-01-18 23:10:01 Instead of diving into computers with no knowledge
general 2023-01-18 23:10:16 Just a casual tower with a 1920x1080 should be good
general 2023-01-18 23:10:42 What
general 2023-01-18 23:10:53 Keyboards are plugged into the tower
general 2023-01-18 23:11:12 And I think you are talking about mechanical keyboards
general 2023-01-18 23:11:23 Oh
general 2023-01-18 23:11:26 Ohhh
general 2023-01-18 23:11:44 Yes
general 2023-01-18 23:11:52 There is a whole community for keyboard noises
general 2023-01-18 23:12:10 I can't bring myself to do that
general 2023-01-18 23:12:20 Not enough money to buy more keyboards
general 2023-01-18 23:12:47 I hate having to clean each individual key
general 2023-01-18 23:12:58 My fingers get all torn up afterwards too
general 2023-01-18 23:13:05 Plucking the keys out of the board
general 2023-01-18 23:13:47 He is using cherry springs
general 2023-01-18 23:15:25 How do you even get .mov
general 2023-01-18 23:15:33 Why not just use mp4
general 2023-01-18 23:15:50 I translate all my video files to mp4
general 2023-01-18 23:16:06 True
