general 2021-07-31 00:22:30 helo
general 2021-07-31 00:22:58 I found a way to get a tube to 1.5k speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:23:52 I managed to make a plane hit 1.8k speed. Is that fast?
general 2021-07-31 00:29:56 this is butt medicine
general 2021-07-31 00:30:48 j
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:36:58 guys I found a way to go stupid fast reliably.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:37:04 like 1k+ fast.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:41:29 wow
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:54:39 I think I might have discovered infinite speed O.O
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:55:03 yeah, but still.
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 00:55:12 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:04:30 ‚ù§Ô∏è glitch engines
general 2021-08-19 16:07:03 how do you stop your plane from shaking side to side
general 2021-08-19 16:07:57 lol
general 2021-08-19 16:08:16 seriously though I built a plane and it likes to shake side to side
general 2021-08-19 16:08:33 I am using a magnet glitch engine, which might be the cause, but idk.
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:35:56 bruh imagine using propellers, or thrusters to power propellers lmao
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:38:53 Hafted
creations-chat 2021-08-19 17:41:27 thats literally stealing tho smh. "Ignore the fact my book is a word for word republish of lotr I didn't steal it i copied it"
general 2021-08-20 00:34:07 bruh stole from tutorial by vincent van gogh
general 2021-08-20 00:34:17 smh very dissapointed
general 2021-08-20 00:34:25 I üß†
general 2021-08-20 00:35:01 seriously though it looks nice. bit low res though. have you considered upgrading to hd-tv
general 2021-08-20 00:37:19 build box over it lol
the-dump 2021-08-20 00:38:29 smh just pop it in the freezer
general 2021-08-21 15:47:37 don't get hit <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-08-21 15:52:07 I wish explosives had more pushing power
general 2021-08-21 15:52:35 ***TIS BUT A SCRATCH***
general 2021-08-21 15:53:09 better tactic: don't play plane crazy <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-08-21 15:53:29 I'm working on balancing this crazy dual magnet engine plane
general 2021-08-21 15:53:49 it can hit like 3k speed and is almost certainly controllable if I weren't such a dumb idiot
general 2021-08-21 15:55:06 0/10 needs more bushes <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-08-21 15:55:21 in fact replace the gun with a bush
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:06:44 big brain move
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:28:47 anyone can give advice on how to balance planes?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:30:15 <:trollface:775024642104229898> problem is my plen likes to wobble from side to side
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:30:18 idk why
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:31:00 nop
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:47:16 my plane no work waiii
help 2021-08-21 16:49:49 my plane nearly perfectly balanced but it still wobble in flight üò¶
help 2021-08-21 16:49:59 halp
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:50:29 lol
help 2021-08-21 16:52:11 it starts wobbling around 3k speed
help 2021-08-21 16:52:34 maybe it has something to do with me using magnets to move the thing
help 2021-08-21 16:54:13 okay.
help 2021-08-21 18:16:31 probably, if builds are transferrable
help 2021-08-21 18:26:39 this
help 2021-08-21 18:26:42 it's possible
creations-chat 2021-08-21 23:18:12 could use more work. cars tend to have back halves but y'know whatever works.
help 2021-08-21 23:19:36 I wonder if I can get aeronautical engineer using magnet engines, since they never said those weren't allowed.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:25:57 If it gets removed I quit
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:26:01 motor lock op
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:28:13 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:28:47 like 99.9% of all good builds will cease to exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:29:10 at least this magnet plane I'm working on will still exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:29:20 but then again it's trash because it keeps wobbling everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:29:53 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:30:04 would be epic if it could actually fly though.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:30:17 unless <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:30:42 try using signs and emoji magic

general 2021-08-21 23:32:21 what's the highest speed your plane should go
the-dump 2021-08-21 23:32:50 ü•≥
general 2021-08-21 23:33:03 noo I live in america
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:48:48 can't wait for plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:49:03 since it has inf map hopefully I can see the true potential of my stupid mag engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:49:37 probably üò¶
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:49:59 but I seriously dunno how fast it can go since the plane keeps spinning out and killing the speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:50:43 I do use keys
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:51:01 it's something to do with balancing the plane <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:52:22 but I've gotten it somewhat stable up to 2.8k
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 23:52:36 I think the speed caps out at the 4k range though <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:07:13 "launching out of nuke tube sir"
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:07:28 parachutes are pretty borked in plane crazy ngl
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:09:56 I made a magnet engine that somehow keeps going after you stop holding down the throttle
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:10:15 it then makes a dead stop once you turn on the throttle again
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:12:19 am dumb
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:12:30 also found a way to generate small amounts of thrust with springs
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:12:34 suspension*
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:13:26 balancing this stupid plane that's either too fast for it's own good or I just really suck at balancing planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:14:05 fair
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:14:16 but idk how to git gud <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:14:37 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:14:49 I shall not go to such depths, following tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:15:20 I wonder what's the fastest anyone's gone
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:15:28 I tried, but there's nowhere good to put them
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:15:44 i dunno. dying is ok I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:16:20 smh nasa hire plane crazy players to go to alpha centauri
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:16:35 "don't worry it worked in the simulations"
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:16:48 nah 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:17:31 until someone finds a way to use parachutes to reliably generate thrust <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:17:56 NO
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:18:03 More thrust = better
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:18:15 I wonder if that was intended lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:18:43 nasa no hire us waiii
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:19:18 I find loose magnets to be absurdly powerful. don't attatch them to ANYTHING AT ALL just leave them in a tube.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:20:32 No. Bad.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:21:04 maybe he likes spending monies
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:23:29 haha motor locking too hard for dum people to understand gl with that
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:24:23 motors are for bending <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:25:08 why are trails so fricking heavy
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:25:18 literally just a stick smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:25:45 heavier than a ballast block at least
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:25:51 maybe even 1.5 ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:26:11 at least that's what the center of mass thing is telling me
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:26:45 ahh, no wonder all my planes are borked
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:27:23 so how is center of mass broken?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:28:05 not using either. I think I'm just noob
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:28:48 am noob
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:29:03 how do i make balanced plane without it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:29:52 and keep fiddling until it stops shaking?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:30:24 huh, my plane isn't shaking when falling
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 00:30:58 ahh, it's not rocking either, but when it's going fast it is
