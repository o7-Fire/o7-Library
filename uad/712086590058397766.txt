general 2023-02-13 23:55:52 I recently got a Lamborghini Aventador lp750.. And I must say its a really nice car. I plan to make upgrades to it and make it a widebody car. it currently has 893 hp, and hits 233 mph max.
general 2023-02-13 23:58:29 I might sell and get a mustang gt5, they are faster and look nicer. I bought it used though and I was messing with its internals and figured out it was already tampered with, The normal hp for this car is 740, and 217 mph max.
general 2023-02-13 23:58:59 I bought it for half the price btw, which is 217K
general 2023-02-14 00:00:12 So I could fix what ever is wrong with the lp750 and upgrade it to make it faster and better then ever before
general 2023-02-14 00:01:01 and the reagra is not my kind of car, I only bought the lambo because it was at such a great price, heck I might keep it and sell its old parts when I replace them.\
general 2023-02-14 00:01:36 then I will rack up money for a gt5 and do the same thing. upgrade and sell its old parts

general 2023-02-14 00:04:28 Yea the gt500 has better hp then the lambo and hits 140 max, so I would have to make it a burnout car or get a slightly better engine then the one my lp750 has
general 2023-02-14 00:05:20 the max it can go default is v8
