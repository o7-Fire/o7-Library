help 2022-09-13 19:49:42 Ship builders! I ask for your assistence with my current situation
I am making my own custom folder ship based off the Virdis Class destroyer from Dead Ahead
And so as you probably expect its about the ship tipping over when unfolded.
I am not entirely done with the ship because i'd rather get rid of this problem then do it later and that means im not even halfway done with the ship so that could be the problem but i dont think so because everything is in center.
Anyone know how to fix this?
(Ping me if you got answers or need your questions answered to help me or ask for pics of what it currently looks like)
help 2022-09-13 19:53:09 very well any positions where? like down the middle or?
