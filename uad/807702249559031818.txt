general 2022-04-21 18:25:23 how does one acquire a rank request ticket?
general 2022-04-21 18:27:22 Aight thx
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:51:02 The battleship?
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:52:44 1: it has the underside hull colours of red and black and 2: most battleships were grey or a darker shade to act as a form of camouflage.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:54:31 That was by accident as i used smoke emitters to make the illusion of a barrel
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:56:12 Im guessing i should of used black circle emojis? And btw every setting on the emitters was set so that the emitters wouldnt emit.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 18:59:15 So is it just the smoke i should pay some attention to or is there anything else. Im ignoring the "add more colour" message.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:02:11 Did you read about what i said about "camouflage" ships like this were painted that way as to try and not draw attention from a distance. Unlike lets say a coast guard boat that is coloured vibrantly to attract attention.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:04:27 But thanks anyways for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:06:09 Yo heard of landships? They existed in WW1. They are called tanks nowadays
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:07:50 Yes but this doesnt answer the message about it being bland af.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:09:32 That would imply the deck being made of wood. A great example of wood being unreliable as a deck and horizontal defense was the sinking of HMS Hood
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:11:48 Read the caption i wrote about it sherlock. Its a mix between WW2 ship design and modern design aka THE DECK
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:13:32 Alright calm down. Crikey.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:15:49 Look at the deck of an arleigh burke class destroyer. It practically has the same deck colour.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:19:01 Aight fine then i'll do something about it. My god these people are getting all bothered about a ships colours. Im being calm about it.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:28:19 True true
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:35:40 How's this
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:38:37 RIP your self confidence
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:40:29 Look at your own name colour before saying anything ._.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 19:42:20 its a bit too wide in the mid section of the hull. but thats my opinion.
general 2022-04-21 19:44:50 i may be stupid here but could i ask how you would show a helium block count if you were attempting to get a rank.
general 2022-04-21 19:45:23 aight thanks
general 2022-04-21 19:48:06 Why are you so rude? oh wait sorry this PCC so that means if you have a high rank or a high amount of ranks that means you MUST act like disrespectful halfwit that doesnt understand the word respect. so im sorry if im simply asking a question about something that you already know about. but then again im just a whitename. kinda childish innit.
general 2022-04-21 20:01:05 Thanks. And sorry for the overreaction
general 2022-04-21 20:05:38 may i ask what i do after i type "$rank" in <#384027830192832513> ?

creations-chat 2022-04-27 14:38:30 Low effort? My man that looks like it was made by someone that only just joined plane crazy and thought it would be a great idea to put their creation on a discord server thats highly judgemental.

general 2022-05-09 14:22:14 Oh lord car enthusiasts...
general 2022-05-09 14:25:47 If I shall elaborate. I dislike car enthusiasts as all they do is gawp at a slightly modified automobile with increased speed that it can only use on a race track. Something like an aircraft for example is interesting as it is able to use all its speed without any limits and are fantastic pieces of engineering. In laymans terms: cars are boring
general 2022-05-09 14:26:43 *speed limits*
general 2022-05-09 14:27:12 What about the hawker harrier....

general 2022-05-25 14:41:39 School shootings in Britain would probably be the teachers fault as an alternative to the stick.
general 2022-05-25 14:42:15 How true that is.

general 2022-07-21 12:41:02 I guess
general 2022-07-21 12:42:55 Putting a T-34 against a T-72 Is the equivalent of  a BF-109 E-4 against an F-35 C
general 2022-07-25 18:59:15 Creations is like the place where you feel happy that you shared something but when you check creations_chat its like a bunch of pedantic 5 year olds yelling at you that your F-18 super hornet has curved intakes instead of boxy ones. This amuses me.

creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:01:44 Nice. Could you tell your friend to actually paint the hull.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:03:44 The USS Discovery does NOT have a bland white exterior. If your wanting to do the NCC-1031 variant and not the NCC-1031-A variant then the hull is a copper bronzy colour with grey rims on the saucer and blue tinted warp coils, bussard collectors and deflector dish. The refit has a *dark* grey hull with blue tinted bussard collectors, warp coils and deflector dish. But *never* has either of them had a straight white exterior. Tell them to fix it if you want but if they don't it just wont be accurate what so ever.
creations-chat 2022-12-08 07:47:34 Which one. TOS era or refit
general 2022-12-11 18:20:31

general 2023-03-27 14:51:16 ...
creations-chat 2023-03-28 06:49:44 I think the hull looks quite good but it needs decorations like markings or small bits of stowage.
general 2023-03-28 06:51:58 I spent a month of my time making a star trek ship. Effort not well spent.
general 2023-03-28 06:53:50 Thanks. Full interiors in objects that fly and excess over 5000 blocks kill me.

general 2023-03-28 06:57:17 That's cool but why are the nacelles so short.
general 2023-03-28 06:58:08 Still need to be a tad bit longer
general 2023-03-28 06:59:10 You need to compensate with length or just thin them down
general 2023-03-28 06:59:58 Oh well then theres not much I can say
general 2023-03-28 07:00:11 You could try make the ship bigger.
general 2023-03-28 07:00:50 My nacelles mainly just contained things to help mine fly. They need a bit of detailing though.
general 2023-03-28 07:00:59 Cool
general 2023-03-28 07:02:09 I wouldn't recommend folding the saucer. But the build is cool just slightly inaccurate.
general 2023-03-28 07:03:03 I know but you can leave it how it is. I just pay attention to small details.
general 2023-03-28 07:03:55 I have a pitiful excuse for an enterprise that no way in hell am I showing.
