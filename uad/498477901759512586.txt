general 2023-01-03 15:32:44 the horse is here
general 2023-01-03 15:33:10 what
general 2023-01-03 15:33:42 sorry i was fighting demons you know
general 2023-01-03 15:33:43 it happens
general 2023-01-03 15:33:59 me
general 2023-01-03 15:35:26 people playground is so fun
general 2023-04-07 21:06:23 does anyone have a code for the final countdown by europe
general 2023-04-07 21:07:14 im just confused because ive heard someone play the rolling stones
general 2023-04-07 21:12:17 ive got a few uncopyrighted audios uploaded to roblox but they dont work in game
general 2023-04-07 21:13:35 Me when im a multi billion dollar corporation but im scared of getting sued once:
general 2023-04-07 21:14:12 (i take away a good part of our platform's uniqueness)
general 2023-04-07 21:14:45 half the time it isnt even copyrighted stuff nerd
general 2023-04-07 21:15:43 even if it was you can lease the rights
general 2023-04-07 21:15:50 even as a standalone person you can do that
general 2023-04-07 21:16:06 if a multi billion dollar corporation cant that just tells me roblox is stupid
general 2023-04-07 21:16:37 most people couldnt monetize the audios
general 2023-04-07 21:16:40 thats not illegal
general 2023-04-07 21:16:41 thats fair use
general 2023-04-07 21:18:51 nvm apparently its illegal to still use copyrighted audio without monetary purposes
general 2023-04-07 21:18:54 thats still stupid
general 2023-04-07 21:19:01 copyright is overbearing in terms of what it can do
general 2023-04-07 21:19:19 like just let some kid listen to their damn rock music
general 2023-04-07 21:19:27 without jumping through 50 loopholes
general 2023-04-07 21:19:56 yes you can listen on youtube and stuff but some people like sharing their music and sometimes its good music and it feels nice to see people have similar music tastes
general 2023-04-07 21:20:28 the whole copyright system needs to be redone
general 2023-04-07 21:20:36 i know its not easy but it would be better for the world as a whole
general 2023-04-07 21:24:56 fr
general 2023-04-07 21:25:50 i remember in alpha/early beta when motorlock was practically nonexistent
general 2023-04-07 21:26:18 i didnt feel like shit when i couldnt get a good looking build cuz i was like 11/12
general 2023-04-07 21:26:24 now i legit cant
general 2023-04-07 21:26:30 focus
general 2023-04-07 21:26:52 i try to avoid motorlock because i just dont like setting up the motors
general 2023-04-07 21:27:00 and i play the game more casually
general 2023-04-07 21:28:28 no i just dont like placing them
general 2023-04-07 21:28:31 thats just me
general 2023-04-07 21:28:38 i do it when i see its necessary
general 2023-04-07 21:29:07 like im building a saleen mustang and now i need motor lock to phase some parts
general 2023-04-07 21:29:10 but its nothing too bad
general 2023-04-07 21:29:26 yea
general 2023-04-07 21:29:59 id like to own one but they are 100k or so
general 2023-04-07 21:30:05 and im not legal driving age
general 2023-04-07 21:30:29 Funniest plane crazy player
general 2023-04-07 21:31:22 at least the builds are still going strong
general 2023-04-07 21:32:36 not forgetting the time i was building a mako from mass effect or something like that and some kid on the side tried to copy me
general 2023-04-07 21:32:40 i pointed it out and he left
general 2023-04-07 21:33:56 Young thuggatron got warned
general 2023-04-07 21:34:06 who is he
general 2023-04-07 21:34:44 oh
general 2023-04-07 21:35:11 he looks cute though
general 2023-04-07 21:35:17 oh mb
general 2023-04-07 21:35:36 epicgamer30109 sounds familiar
general 2023-04-07 21:36:26 when you are cutting people and the knife starts gliding through them
general 2023-04-07 21:36:43 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-04-07 21:37:09 is that dude actually 11
general 2023-04-07 21:37:44 unc
general 2023-04-07 21:49:23 yea that epicgamer kid is terrible tf
general 2023-04-07 21:49:32 Ford shoes
general 2023-04-07 21:50:35 Jordan did do that move so yea
general 2023-04-07 21:52:29 you wrong for that
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 21:54:54 is there anyway to bypass thrust imbalance
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 21:55:09 because sometimes its bordderline impossible to make a build stable while its moving
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:32:41 ong and increase the build area
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:32:59 i dont like folding everything just cuz its ever so slightly too long
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:28 yep
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:32 also
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:47 why is this dude disguising his lag machine as a "falling apart building"
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:34:22 "me and this dude arent lagging" gaslighting
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:38:06 some dude unadded me because i told his friend to stop using a lag machine
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:38:08 💀
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:41:35 we need votekicking in this game tbh
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:41:59 true
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:02 but
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:04 idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:08 we need some mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:15 to prevent people like this
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:25 from being PoS
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:42:54 yes its not putting that much of a strain on this computer
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:14 but its still effecting the game pretty bad
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:18 yea
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:23 thats the thing that annoyed me
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:38 i played since alpha cuz i have the badge and plus i remember playing it on both my old and new accounts
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:46 and i remember when it was basically nonexistent
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:52 when i came back i was so confused
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:56 not blaming people
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:59 just wish i didnt have to
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:44:04 place so many motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:44:11 just to make a build look tolerable
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:45:15 like look at what this dude is doing
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:04 why are plane crazy players
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:06 so insensitive
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:08 to 9/11
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:12 good lord
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:17 like
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:22 i appreciate a dark joke every now and then
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:30 but these people just are straight up insensitive
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:40 a building is being destroyed?
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:42 9/11
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:46 a plane simply exists
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:47 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:50 9/11
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:49:28 im only staying here in the slight chance i can keep being an opp and blacklist him the second a piece of his build lands on my plot
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:49:47 its the sheer amount of times ive seen people do it
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:50:08 like ive been on edgelord discord servers in the past and they aint do it as frequently as most people do it in this game
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:50:24 but
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:50:25 the point is
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:50:28 corny lag machine
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:51:09 i think you have to be level 3
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:52:11 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:52:15 ive seen a lot of those too
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:26 
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:36 yea im making a dropship
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:45 i dont really plan to use motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:50 i think it'll be fine without it
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:06 its full i believe
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:10 the server
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:20 im prob gonna server hop anyway
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:26 this guy is getting out of hand
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:39 yea
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:42 ima server hop
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:55:36 ill just
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:55:37 add you
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 18:07:30 wolfenstein reference
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:48:56 why do so many kids in this game build shitty lag machines
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:55:12 honestly this game's moderation needs to get their money up not their funny up
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:55:30 i rarely use this server and i went to the report channel
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:55:34 only to find its closed
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:04 ???
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:12 stupid
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:20 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:26 how are you gonna make a sandbox where kids can make
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:30 yahtzee symbols
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:32 and
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:36 lag machines
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:40 yet not have a report system
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:56:44 and barely any moderation
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:57:13 i really like this game but its kinda annoying when 90% of the games playerbase is annoying children who get away with stuff
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:57:22 when it really doesnt have to be that way
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:57:38 like you wont catch ALL but a good chunk would be caught
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:58:12 like im sorry but these kids are too dumb to blacklist people so this guy can just continue using a lag machine
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:58:33 if everyone blacklisted him one of his machine's parts would be more likely to phase into a blacklisted plot
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:58:36 causing the build to reset
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:58:46 it would happen so often he would leave
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:58:47 but nah
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:59:53 like he even tried to hide his username but i have it
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 05:59:58 unfortunately i cant report him
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:00:47 now theres a second lagmachine
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:00:50 okay yea im leaving
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:01:23 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:01:45 TruthCovenant and Toutou3
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:01:48 just saving those names
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:01 yea but yk you wont be allowing tos breaking activity
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:23 plenty of games have good moderation and player count
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:31 space engineers is one example somewhat
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:35 similar building style
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:38 like very similar
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:47 although most moderation is player based
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:55 its still good to the point there are many people who play
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:02:59 and its overall the same basic rules
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:04:24 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:09 oh yea
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:14 thats quite ridiculous
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:25 like
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:36 i can get building historical craft even if its german
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:37 as long
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:39 as theres yknow
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:41 funny windmills
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:42 no
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:45 funny windmills rather
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:05:57 a lot of people do that
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:00 but
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:03 theres just times
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:11 when people build
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:13 the windmill
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:20 just to
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:21 be edgy
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:24 and hateful
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:39 the amount of neo yahtzees in modern society is still crazy though
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:06:52 i swear theres more than there were in the decades following ww2
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 06:07:18 what
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 04:37:00 Why does this game have neo yahtzees
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:23:47 how do you combat flingers
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:31:59 yea kinda a nerd moment
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:32:22 this is the same game where people build mechanisms that launch you at escape velocity
creations-chat 2023-06-23 05:37:59 dodge the question simulator
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:49:08 plane crazy players when a creation is not perfectly motor locked or accurate
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:54:19 true
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:54:32 but sometimes i see a pretty good build without motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:54:40 though its usually stuff thats not a vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:55:25 kinda ridiculous if you ask me but wtv
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:55:27 like its
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:55:29 very good
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:55:31 dont get me wrong
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:56:45 space engineers has similar building but theres no system similar to motorlocking so its standards and building community is typically more
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:56:48 accepting
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:57:08 i think its because ive been in that community more thats why i think that
general 2023-06-23 09:13:33 okay what happened
general 2023-06-23 09:13:49 oh just people being insensitive
general 2023-06-23 09:13:55 amazing

general 2023-06-23 09:18:56 are you slow
general 2023-06-23 09:19:20 ??? no
general 2023-06-23 09:19:27 im pretty average bro
general 2023-06-23 09:19:30 most people are
general 2023-06-23 09:19:38 u right
general 2023-06-23 09:20:15 they are tonedeaf
general 2023-06-23 09:20:46 but it would be an issue if one of their relatives died in a plane crash, then death isnt funny
general 2023-06-23 09:20:59 double standards 101
general 2023-06-23 09:21:09 sure
general 2023-06-23 09:21:20 "its just a memorial for 9/11"
general 2023-06-23 09:21:32 "im not making fun of them trust"
general 2023-06-23 09:21:47 people say that excuse for 9/11 builds
general 2023-06-23 09:22:04 my point is
general 2023-06-23 09:22:20 people die and people act like its the event of it being destroyed is funny
general 2023-06-23 09:22:35 when said destruction caused the death bro
general 2023-06-23 09:22:58 never, just saying that i dont really believe him
general 2023-06-23 10:05:30 titanfall 3 will be out before pc2
general 2023-06-23 10:07:29 womp womp
general 2023-06-23 10:10:41 imagine
general 2023-06-23 10:10:46 a transformer thats an sr71
general 2023-06-23 10:11:08 box 🔥
general 2023-06-23 10:11:22 lol
general 2023-06-23 10:12:23 im stupid theres a transformer that is an sr71
general 2023-06-23 10:13:00 id assume that something big happens later this year
general 2023-06-23 10:13:30 not sure why resize tool wasnt in the game day one for pc1
general 2023-06-23 10:13:59 motorlock only exists tbh cuz you cant clip anything really or mesh parts together
general 2023-06-23 10:14:25 its there for the sake of convience
general 2023-06-23 10:14:30 realistically
general 2023-06-23 10:14:38 any other game dev wouldve just added resize
general 2023-06-23 10:14:51 yea but it takes like 10x less the time to have something like resize and rotate
general 2023-06-23 10:15:06 plus
general 2023-06-23 10:15:11 you can make it look even better
general 2023-06-23 10:15:15 ik
general 2023-06-23 10:15:42 my f4 wouldnt exist if motorlock isnt in pc2
general 2023-06-23 10:15:45 but its wtc
general 2023-06-23 10:15:46 wtv
general 2023-06-23 10:15:49 resize is comign
general 2023-06-23 10:15:50 or should
general 2023-06-23 10:15:55 thats good enough to me
general 2023-06-23 10:16:11 i have way more experience in f3x and its analogues than motorlock
general 2023-06-23 10:16:23 it would have to be or most people's builds would break
general 2023-06-23 10:16:35 motorlock is annoying though
general 2023-06-23 10:16:39 its not hard
general 2023-06-23 10:16:47 just really damn annoying if you mess up once
general 2023-06-23 10:16:53 thats why i dont really like it
general 2023-06-23 10:17:23 i wouldve taken way less time building an sr 1 normandy from mass effect if they just had resize and rotate
general 2023-06-23 10:17:33 and it would look way better
general 2023-06-23 10:17:43 it looks quite bad
general 2023-06-23 10:17:58 we better get something good this year from pc2
general 2023-06-23 10:18:12 im not
general 2023-06-23 10:18:14 expecting a full release
general 2023-06-23 10:18:15 but
general 2023-06-23 10:18:16 something
general 2023-06-23 10:18:20 idk like a beta or alpha
general 2023-06-23 10:18:30 ya
general 2023-06-23 10:18:44 i made a thruster in f3x around a month ago and i really like it
general 2023-06-23 10:19:02 if i wanted to create something somewhat close in plane crazy i would have to use motor lock 1000 times over
general 2023-06-23 10:19:24 what
general 2023-06-23 10:19:45 f3x would also be good cuz im really in the mood for making a mech or something
general 2023-06-23 10:19:48 like a jaeger
general 2023-06-23 10:20:16 well maybe not exactly f3x
general 2023-06-23 10:20:26 it depends
general 2023-06-23 10:20:33 if you want detail no not really
general 2023-06-23 10:21:02 we shouldnt have to rely on motorlock tho
general 2023-06-23 10:21:09 resize and stuff has been around for years
general 2023-06-23 10:21:14 longer
general 2023-06-23 10:21:16 than motorlock
general 2023-06-23 10:21:29 thats why
general 2023-06-23 10:21:52 im sure they could find some way to experiment with it
general 2023-06-23 10:21:58 and make it usable
general 2023-06-23 10:22:02 and at least mostly stable
general 2023-06-23 10:22:48 one concern is if someone used the resize thing to cover people's builds and such
general 2023-06-23 10:22:51 or just to annoy people
general 2023-06-23 10:23:00 im sure they could limit the size
general 2023-06-23 10:23:02 darkrp does that
general 2023-06-23 10:23:11 its like
general 2023-06-23 10:23:15 a 100 or so studs max
general 2023-06-23 10:23:16 for one part
general 2023-06-23 10:23:25 wait
general 2023-06-23 10:23:28 how long is 100 studs
general 2023-06-23 10:23:41 wait
general 2023-06-23 10:23:44 i found an image
general 2023-06-23 10:23:51 okay
general 2023-06-23 10:23:53 maybe like
general 2023-06-23 10:23:55 50 studs
general 2023-06-23 10:23:57 or 60 studs
general 2023-06-23 10:23:59 should be the max
general 2023-06-23 10:24:12 plots will be bigger anyway right
general 2023-06-23 10:24:40 true
general 2023-06-23 10:25:00 i think they could have resize and motor lock though
general 2023-06-23 10:25:37 like maybe resizing pistons or motors has a smaller resize limit
general 2023-06-23 10:25:39 maybe 20 studs
general 2023-06-23 10:26:05 its good to discuss and brainstorm
general 2023-06-23 10:26:22 yea
general 2023-06-23 10:26:31 blacklist should just be on by default in pc2
general 2023-06-23 10:26:38 and whitelist should be a thing
general 2023-06-23 10:26:44 to allow people to drive ur stuff or smthn
general 2023-06-23 10:27:04 like maybe building several jets and your friend could hop in one
general 2023-06-23 10:27:08 and could fly in formation
general 2023-06-23 10:27:27 is that human fall flat
general 2023-06-23 10:27:45 but ya
general 2023-06-23 10:27:58 the day pc2 comes out with (hopefully) every feature that most people want
general 2023-06-23 10:28:09 if it does it should be off by default
general 2023-06-23 10:28:17 by base it should look no different from pc1
general 2023-06-23 10:28:22 other than that new water or wtv
general 2023-06-23 10:28:43 i think
general 2023-06-23 10:28:49 its prob just some texture
general 2023-06-23 10:29:14 for mobile players and such to even log on every advanced shader setting should be off by default
general 2023-06-23 10:29:23 just so their phone doesnt explode
general 2023-06-23 10:29:36 or this shitty yet reliable office computer im using
general 2023-06-23 10:29:58 i had a laptop
general 2023-06-23 10:29:59 was pretty good
general 2023-06-23 10:30:04 until operating system error
general 2023-06-23 10:30:25 i took that mf everywhere but i still handled it like it was my child
general 2023-06-23 10:30:45 hopefully at least this christmas ill get a pretty moderate gaming laptop
general 2023-06-23 10:31:02 yea that doesnt look too bad
general 2023-06-23 10:31:28 same kinda
general 2023-06-23 10:31:39 i can go up to 7 if there arent laggy builds
general 2023-06-23 10:31:53 like rn i have it at 7
general 2023-06-23 10:32:00 my old laptop could comfortably run it at max tho
general 2023-06-23 10:34:12 yo chill
general 2023-06-23 10:34:16 i think thats just
general 2023-06-23 10:34:20 overdramatization
general 2023-06-23 10:34:55 i say shit like that but i ofc dont mean it just means i dont want someone to do someting
general 2023-06-23 10:34:57 embed fail
general 2023-06-23 10:35:20 i gave image perms i just cant use them in this channel
general 2023-06-23 10:35:22 have*
general 2023-06-23 10:37:00 nah
general 2023-06-23 10:37:14 group opinions on shit dont always mean its bad or good
general 2023-06-23 10:37:25 not really
general 2023-06-23 10:37:37 ive seen some pretty decent builds
general 2023-06-23 10:37:50 ik
general 2023-06-23 10:37:58 but something being bad or good is entirely subjective
general 2023-06-23 10:38:04 what
general 2023-06-23 10:38:43 im just saying cuz i dont judge people's builds much unless they insult me or smthn
general 2023-06-23 10:38:55 and here it just seems like people hate decent shit
general 2023-06-23 10:39:14 to them
general 2023-06-23 10:39:40 yep
general 2023-06-23 10:40:06 space engineers ratings of builds are much fairer
general 2023-06-23 10:40:14 its his opinion dawg
general 2023-06-23 10:40:37 yea i dont really agree
general 2023-06-23 10:40:39 but
general 2023-06-23 10:40:44 its sitll his opinion
general 2023-06-23 10:40:49 i think hall of fame is amazing
general 2023-06-23 10:41:01 how zawg
general 2023-06-23 10:41:16 sorry but one price

general 2023-06-23 10:44:48 i will admit a good chunk of anime is weird

general 2023-06-23 10:46:24 thats how ive always seen it
general 2023-06-23 10:46:51 i didnt really see it as much different from american cartoons, other than overall art direction and plot tropes
general 2023-06-23 10:47:11 its an animation, thats meant for various ages
general 2023-06-23 10:47:17 thats massively popular
