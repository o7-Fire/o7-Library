plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:03:29 you can look off the actual planes real image and look at the nose and find the blocks that follow the right shape. you can also experiment with different nose types and get others opinions
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:04:14 if someone says "get skill" its not like they can haul it out of their ass they need to know more specifications
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:04:40 lets see a plane of yours

plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:09:01 i just realised you are the best builder in this server tf
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:09:06 expert supreme
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:09:25 unless theres a master supreme thats never active
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:09:51 well if you got expert in every single rank then to me your the best builder
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:12:13 also does anyone have tips on stopping motors from streching with vtol? im making a drone that hovers using no hover engines or anchors or helium or any cheaty circus tricks. the propellers move by motor power and the drone is too big to use super rockets.
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:13:23 yeah i use motors to adjust the angle of the blades and they extend and bug out for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:14:04 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:16:26 what is angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 17:16:38 i know motorlock but not wtf ever that is

plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:31 i dont usually go crazy on things as long as they work but someone told me i should take time and try to make it cool
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:41 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:13:44 if you look back at oldish tanks they use trainwheels and put tracks around it
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:13:54 the oldest tanks are actually wooden
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:15:12 imagine going back in the late 1800s trying to find the first tank, and you see that it looks like an average bad piggies HD player made it
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:15:14 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 20:29:45 you can never look at this chat and no see some conflict lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 20:30:31 angle lock is rotating a motor and locking it in place correct me if im wrong

plane-crazy 2022-04-21 19:52:23 Anyone have tips on how to make a hover gyro for spaceships
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 19:52:32 Hover without hover thruster or helium
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 19:54:43 I forget how to make hover thruster balls work like a weak anchor block do you know what I I talking about?
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 19:56:07 It's like a hover ball around pistons and wing panels and when you power the ball and spin it, it just stops all forces from moving your ship except collisions
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 19:56:15 I forget how tho
