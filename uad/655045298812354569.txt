general 2023-03-27 05:39:31 mechanicabetter
general 2023-03-27 05:39:55 butbmore mechanical based
general 2023-03-27 05:40:53 oh my gah
general 2023-03-27 05:41:15 mehcnisicia is a better game overall than plane crazy
general 2023-03-27 05:41:45 brr9
general 2023-03-27 05:42:05 but the advantages plane crazy has over mechani shows alot
general 2023-03-27 05:42:28 huh
general 2023-03-27 05:42:49 we're looking at it objectively
general 2023-03-27 05:42:56 how old the game is doesnt matter
general 2023-03-27 05:43:01 its what people are gonna play
general 2023-03-27 05:43:28 but mechanic owner sucks tho
general 2023-03-27 05:43:31 hes mad toxic
general 2023-03-27 05:43:36 yes
general 2023-03-27 05:44:08 i got muted in mechanic permanently  bc i questioned the owner about him being toxic to his community
general 2023-03-27 05:45:18 yes but mechaic is mechanical based and theres more opportunity to make mechanical builds
general 2023-03-27 05:45:30 honestly
general 2023-03-27 05:45:39 its up to preference at this point
general 2023-03-27 05:45:46 mechanical builds
