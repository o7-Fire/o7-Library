creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:20:08 LEGO is always an adjective. So LEGO bricks, LEGO elements, LEGO sets, etc. Never, ever "legos."
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:22:42 The correct plural of LEGO is just ‚ÄòLEGO‚Äô (or, if the company has its way, ‚ÄòLEGO bricks‚Äô or ‚ÄòLEGO sets‚Äô). This is Brick Fanatics, after all, so we feel safe assuming you have a solid knowledge of the LEGO Group, its products and the terminology involved.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:27:26 I live in aus too and yeah although I hear everyone say Lego‚Äôs üò†  also welcome to the late night gang
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:31:07 Lego stated that it is LEGO no matter the situation unless it is something belonging to lego (lego‚Äôs). Now shut up and learn.

(This was from the LEGO group, so you can‚Äôt argue against it.)
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:35:32 Also, you call multiple fish fish, deer are deer,. So you also have a terrible knowledge of plurals.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:37:40 No, LEGO stated that would not make sense, it is officially termed there are twenty seven LEGO bricks on the table.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:41:17 LEGO stated what I am saying so I am going off what the company who invented the 3 LEGO systems said, not a random person who clearly knows nothing about LEGO.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 13:44:26 Exactly lol I have build LEGO for 9 years so this  kid needs to shut up. We clearly know more that this stupid American. Also <@870152086044700682> can get banned for being 11 lol
