plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:04:12 Lol can you make the osprey?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:05:10 What are better? Jets or Rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:06:52 How would you design an aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:07:38 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:07:52 No no as in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:09:53 Can you build Elon musk rocket?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:13:19 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:16:50 Ok, so if I were to balance the aircraft, where would I want the weight and aerodynamics to be in the center?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:17:27 That’s done
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:17:39 The blue and the yellow
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:18:06 Would you prefer to have the blue above or bellow the weight?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:19:14 Can I see pls?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:19:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:22:17 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:22:44 Ah so it doesn’t matter?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:24:12 I see so it’s heavier in the front and the wings at the back give it lift
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:24:35 Because the weight is higher the plane is lighter
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:30:52 Oh yeh and with flaps?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:31:10 Is it with motors?
