general 2020-09-01 07:14:12 Hey I just joined
general 2020-09-01 07:15:06 That's literally my Zeppelin-
general 2020-09-01 07:15:17 But uhh..
general 2020-09-01 07:15:21 It flies normally.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:18:43 If I send a pic of my Zeppelin, a bunch of people will get triggered.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:19:19 Nope.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:19:28 I don't have the DELAG symbol.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:19:42 But uhh, I didn't make a hydrogen airship.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:19:48 Okay wait.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:19:55 (Opening Plane Crazy)
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:20:09 What I made is a Zeppelin Neue Technologie.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:20:48 Also I didn't rocketspam it.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:21:03 Kinda like that.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:21:13 But smaller.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:21:30 Alright, prepare for a bunch of triggered people.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:22:08 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:24:22 The moment when you deploy your parachute while going 100 kts horizontally-
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:25:52 ***AHEM***
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:26:16 Reaches 80 kts at maximum.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:26:40 Only when engines are on VTOL mode.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:26:49 Yeah, I'm gonna use wedges soon.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:27:29 However if you put it on horizontal mode...
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:27:36 You can't stop it's acceleration.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:28:19 One of uhh..
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:28:35 One of Ferdinand's first airships.
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:28:46 Night:
general 2020-09-01 07:31:23 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 07:34:59 Maybe..
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:39:07 Correct me if I'm wrong but, turn on toggle?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:39:45 I'll do that in the future.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:39:57 Or maybe, now.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:42:28 Am I doing this right?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:45:30 Now I have a structural problem.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:46:37 Correct..
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:46:43 It just needs a sharp edge.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:50:16 My ping's stuck here RIP
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:51:00 
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:52:02 ........
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:54:23 Are you-
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:55:58 I'm using a 5G internet-
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:56:57 Game, are you sure this is DiamondPlate?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:58:43 Relaunched it and then this is what the game gives me.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 07:59:04 Well, the default blocks are just making me say bye bye eyes.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:10:58 Okay I took a while to finish that blocky front.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:11:37 Now I have this.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:15:30 The back is what's left.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:15:48 This is gonna be tricky..
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:17:22 The tails are a problem..
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:18:43 Wait, I forgot about delta wings.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:20:28 So I'm gonna remove the wing panels for now?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:22:31 Wing panels, removed.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 08:24:48 ***Realizes this is the wrong chat***
creations-chat 2020-09-01 09:30:05 I took a while on making the Zeppelin smooth, now it looks like this.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 09:30:29 Dumb or no?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:17:13 Hey, remember my old blocky Zeppelin?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:18:06 I mean, **just look at this.**
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:18:25 Let me open Plane Crazy, give me a moment.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:19:10 I'm not making a german-made airship.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:19:49 Okay, now.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:20:07 Remember this?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:20:30 This is it now.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:21:38 HEY I'M TAKING OFF DON'T YOU EVEN-
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:22:03 IDK, a giant shredder?!
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:22:53 I just took off on low graphics quality.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:23:51 That blocky airship was the Zeppelin NT-RN-I.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:24:08 What I'm flying now is the NT-RN-IF.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:25:20 Night just approached.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:26:04 Goodness sakes-
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:26:22 ^ You can decide.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:28:36 So I just loaded in my war class and this is what's inside.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:29:29 Wait what.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:29:49 Wait, it's always toxic?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:31:01 Oh by the way, my Zeppelin is not rocket spammed.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:31:50 OKAY CAN I JUST ASK WHO THE FLUZWAD MADE THAT?!
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:32:42 A tutorial, I never watched Plane Crazy tutorials.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:33:01 AFK gotta eat
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:42:11 Back.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:42:38 You know, I'm that type of guy who avoids swearing.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:42:56 And, why are we talking about this in the creations chat?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 03:43:25 We might as well switch chats?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:22:27 Quick question, how do you make a uhh..
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:22:48 A double cargo bay door?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:24:03 I think the russian copters?
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:25:03 Yeah, that.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:26:02 I kinda wanna have a double cargo bay door for biplanes or cargo in my Zeppelin.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:28:24 Look, I just joined into THIS.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:30:58 What I have is this system.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:31:28 The platform lowers, cargo goes in, it goes back inside the Zeppelin, then take off.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:31:48 Also wow.
creations-chat 2020-10-06 10:07:41 AM I SEEING THIS RIGHT?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 10:16:40 What could go wrong?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 10:19:19 (Control V isn't working)
creations-chat 2020-10-06 10:53:51 Join me.
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:07:33 I've been playing Plane Crazy for a year and still don't know how to FOLD
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:10:46 I'm just doing fold tests right now
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:14:47 I just finished the folding test, you can watch me do it
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:15:17 (By joining me)
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:29:39 Can my copy paste just WORK
creations-chat 2020-10-06 11:57:00 Have you told Rick about that copy paste issue?
general 2020-10-07 00:13:43 Who the fluzwad-
general 2020-10-07 00:21:54 Spammer
creations-chat 2020-10-07 03:45:41 ^ Suuure
creations-chat 2020-10-07 03:48:24 Xavier, wait till my small Zeppelin goes to your plot
general 2020-10-07 10:59:12 Here's two pics you can't unsee
general 2020-10-07 10:59:20 
general 2020-10-07 10:59:27 
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:33:38 This is my new Zeppelin. (If you're asking why there's a hole on it I'm planning to make a cargo bay door for small planes)
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:34:04 Maybe?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:34:47 My only concern is, WHY DID THE FUEL TANKS MAKE A FACE
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:35:35 I sometimes disable infinite fuel so yeah..
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:35:51 Most of the time I use infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:37:47 Also it has cargo bay doors
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:38:30 And it runs perfectly with no rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:39:00 It's a concept..
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:40:05 Correct me if I'm wrong but is that the Airlander 10?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:41:25 Exactly but the bombs get stuck on the blasted trapdoors
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:42:24 
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:42:46 You sure my rocket engine experiment has 123 blocks?
general 2020-12-11 13:43:33 What is going on here?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:45:20 Is this the concept you're talking about?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:46:15 Alright, perfect.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:46:49 So turn on the On Impact option?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:47:19 So it explodes when it touched the ground
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:47:54 That's kind of a reference to Zeppelin Wars..
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:48:13 Wait so ignore self?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:48:41 On Impact, Ignore Self, Arm on Key.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:48:44 All those 3.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:49:54 Also I actually landed a Zeppelin on a Zeppelin.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:50:32 Shush it's a rigid airship not a non-rigid airship
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:53:48 I once joined a PvP server and instantly committed USS Akron
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:54:01 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:54:14 ***MORE*** thiccness
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:54:34 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:54:36 MORE
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:55:11 Know what I'll join you
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:55:59 You on a VIP?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:57:18 2 blocks aren't enough
general 2020-12-11 14:00:52 I'm just vibing in <#384021699466756107> what is going on
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:01:03 Too wide
general 2020-12-12 03:27:20 Can I send a huge Obama message here?
the-dump 2020-12-12 03:27:41 You call-
the-dump 2020-12-12 03:27:43 What-
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 03:42:22 Okay, what should my Zeppelin bombing bay look like?
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 08:03:10 Doot
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:31:27 Hey apparently, I roast builds in the Plane Crazy subreddit now..
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:32:26 Looks like a block of rotten cheese that tried to be a rocket.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:32:55 Anyway here's my roast on an inappropriate build...
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:34:46 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:36:36 Here's another one that I did.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:38:15 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:42:27 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:44:12 My god, you played SCP with graphics lower than a windows 1?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:44:45 Don't ask.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:11:26 Do you have a custom build with no rocket engines used in it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:19:28 Anyway, I have a physics breaker..
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:21:14 Why's my server Khmer or Thai?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:22:59 
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:23:09 **Oh.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:24:18 There, I joined both of you.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:25:30 Better come to my plot.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:39:44 I make vehicles that don't have rocket engines.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:39:53 And I don't spam engines inside my vehicles.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:40:27 Have an airliner V/STOL.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:40:45 **I meant bomber.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:41:36 SOME GREEN PISTON PLANE WITH AUTISM IS ATTACKING ME...
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:42:17 Should I...
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:43:53 **Someone destroyed me before I have the chance to Kamikaze.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:49:18 What do you mean? It's just a German kamikaze V/STOL.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:49:49 **This thing uses a hotkey.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:50:16 By the way, no rocket engines in this thing.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:50:31 Not even propellers.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:50:49 Just 5 jet engines.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:51:21 Conveyor? NOTHING.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:00 Not ever hover engines.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:08 **My top speed is 150.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:34 Are you sure about that?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:53:16 Only these 5 jet engines.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:53:45 **No.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:54:23 
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:54:28 Go to my plot.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:54:54 How about Xavier?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:48:29 **Oh no.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 06:30:37 
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:44:55 Look what I found.
general 2021-04-15 10:47:34 Anyway, I found this from backreading.
the-dump 2021-04-17 11:55:23 Okay then.
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 03:37:54 
the-dump 2021-04-19 10:24:28 Guess he just did it.
the-dump 2021-04-20 07:12:39 
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:15:30 Found a motorlock hater.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:29:52 Did we come up with a new phobia?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:29:58 Motorlophobia?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:30:58 Motorlophobia is basically the fear of builds with motorlock.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:37:42 Yep.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:38:03 And what's the treatment to Motorlophobia and Motorlothymia?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:38:10 ~~Death therapy~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 05:55:50 I bet his builds are more useless than turned off trails.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:01:15 SO HIS BUILDS ARE MORE USELESS THAN WHITE CRAYONS THEN.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:02:56 Anyway, this is what Thirds made days ago.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:03:26 Guess what, I just joined into an empty server.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:03:50 ...
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:04:27 Then why is there no gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:05:43 This is how you professionally THROW people.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:06:40 Wanna see me roast my own build?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:08:31 ***Finding the picture***
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:10:21 By the way, a mech approached my antiphysics and made it pose like this:
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:12:33 
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:12:45 It's true, right?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:13:13 It's basically this but with wheels.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:14:31 My braincells will drain faster than the speed of that thing.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:15:09 **Yes.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:31 Wanna know the disadvantage of my hovertrain?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:45 **It spins uncontrollably.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:14 Because...
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:18:12 Anyway, have this.

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:24:20 
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:24:30 That is a C A R ?

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:27:35 So this was my first custom working plane...
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:28:12 Kinda looks like the Schweben...
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:30:55 Anyway, I have a Zeppelin with a ramp.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:02:57 Here's my friend shredding a car.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:09:32 Look, it's Thirds.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:17:33

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:07:59 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:08:05 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:09:51 Yeah, but people will probably abuse it...
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:11:29 By the way, this may be my last roast on the subreddit. People are getting annoyed by it.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:11:59 Might only do it on inappropriate builds..
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:12:50 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:12:59 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:16:11 Bet.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:17:26 Oh.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:20:23 Finally.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:21:22 What are those?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 13:24:41 ***My bomber V/STOL being abused***

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 09:59:21 Place it, beside the motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 10:04:24 That fixed it.
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 10:05:20 I made the fat plane unfold at lightning speeds.

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 13:14:28 Basically, I tried to fly through the propeller.
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 13:14:32 And then...
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 13:14:36 **That happened.**
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 13:15:02 I think it was the humanoid root part?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 13:15:31 How rare is that glitch?

plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:24:52 So what does it mean if my original build got called a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:25:35 Have you ever seen a tutorial of something that looks like this?
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:25:58 Tut, orial.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:26:49 Does THIS look like a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:30:12 I know, it's just a weird retrofuturistic vehicle.
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:31:24 One thing to describe my way of engineering, **weird.**
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:32:31 Go roast this thing.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:13:03 This is Middy in a nutshell.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:15:33 All to become this.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:16:16 Because it's Middy who made it.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:16:39 He's gonna turn it into Qantas.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:18:18 I don't know how Middy's mind works.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:19:49 He even made a 777 with that same amount of complexity.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:20:00 **W i t h  w o r k i n g  a u t o p i l o t .**
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:21:53 Meanwhile me with my weird VTOL MiG looking-
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:26:16 Yes, you heard that right.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:27:21 Oh wait, it was an A220 he made with working **a u t o p i l o t .**
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:27:41 He just presses a button twice and the plane goes up gradually.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:27:58 His 717 has stability assist.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:30:03 I don't know how he did it.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:30:49 Or how it works.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:32:04 All I'm telling you is the fact that there's always this one person playing Phonk music while driving at 250 studs per second.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 01:33:53 I don't have a clip.
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 13:18:57 You know, I sometimes question the logic of this game...
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 05:27:21 
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:36:52 Go criticize this thing I just finished.
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:39:09 I got sick of folding so uhhh...
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:40:17 All I'm saying is, I'm kind of in the mid when it comes to skill level.
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:40:32 That's my first shot at custom angle lock.
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 14:41:10 PvP am I right?
