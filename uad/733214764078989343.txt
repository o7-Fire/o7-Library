general 2022-05-28 21:31:34 We don’t, just not yet
general 2022-05-28 21:31:56 the sonic boom is still the main issue
general 2022-05-28 21:32:05 well yeah
general 2022-05-28 21:32:24 But the sonic boom is one of the reason why it died
general 2022-05-28 21:33:54 Anyone? I use the shredders to destroy the shredders, Shredder player joins, me spawns my shredder to destroy him/her
general 2022-05-28 21:35:08 rip

general 2022-05-29 01:40:47 I have a small question, and that is can i use previously built planes to apply for Ranks?
general 2022-05-29 01:42:56 So guys
general 2022-05-29 01:43:10 Can i use old builds to apply for ranks?
general 2022-05-29 01:43:22 Ok thanks you sir
general 2022-05-29 01:48:29 I just relies, do motor locked blocks count as disconnected blocks?
general 2022-05-29 01:50:04 For ranks
general 2022-05-29 01:50:50 Ok thanks
general 2022-05-29 01:52:37 Well motors are technically disconnected
general 2022-05-29 01:52:49 so i was just making sure
general 2022-05-29 01:53:22 The motor is two parts of one block to spin
general 2022-05-29 01:53:26 that’s how
general 2022-05-29 01:53:51 And locks are still technically two parts
general 2022-05-29 01:53:58 They just won’t move at all
general 2022-05-29 01:54:56 I have a some what complex but it dog fights well
general 2022-05-29 01:55:00 A P-40
general 2022-05-29 01:58:48 What is that
general 2022-05-29 01:59:32 Ok
general 2022-05-29 03:46:41 im sorry but how does the rank request system work?

plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:29:55 normally i’d have a fan to do that…
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:03 But it kinda.. broke
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:10 Oh man
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:24 My ships at around 600-800 blocks already hurt my pc badly
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:55 I don’t do ships
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:58 I do planes
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:31:02 And some tanks

plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:32:13 My laptop?
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:32:15 2018
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:32:37 I idk
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:32:43 Maybe it’s for work
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:32:50 And have sheesh wifi
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:33:01 and can’t cool down quick enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:33:10 and isn’t upgraded
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:34:23 Pretty sure that’s ram’s fault?
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:34:30 not the gpu?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:13:30 keep it, it means German, for the dummies that don't know
the-dump 2022-06-19 12:14:07 
the-dump 2022-06-19 12:14:15 And that’s how i became an idiot
the-dump 2022-06-19 13:00:40 Im Asian so that’s technically true for me as well
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:44:36 I just learnt how to camera lock and i tried to bite off too much more than i can chew
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:45:16 I did
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:45:27 I tried that
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:45:44 and that was on a base that i was building
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:45:53 I some how fricked it up
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:46:16 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:46:24 My locks made me run out of space
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:46:55 yeah, saving cam lock doesn’t, but if you already did the locking, it works just fine
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:47:02 I did
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:47:09 That’s why i ran out of space for my wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:48:00 i already did 90% of the body, no way in hell im redoing all that just for the experimental wing that i don’t even know if the design will work or not
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:48:38 Wat
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:49:09 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:50:03 mean while i like building half scale and the 1m x1m x1m blocks doesn’t quite half

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:07:42 Also that
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:08:16 exactly

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:12:31 if you fly at least to 20k ft
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:12:40 Not a single soul is up there
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:13:51 Around 60k meters
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:02 One ft is around 2 meters
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:16 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:18 My bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:26 1ft around 3 meters
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:49 my head still hurts so that happened
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:15:09 what
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:15:37 Yeah, i am stupid
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:15:49 sigh, let me re check my bs
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:16:02 Around 9 k meters
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:16:14 Were you normally around that height
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:17:20 Welp, you probably didn’t get in a match with some fighters that actually go hunt bombers
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:17:30 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:17:53 I might go for the occasional bomber kill
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:17:57 but i don’t hunt
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:07 good luck
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:17 The first few bot match is at 1
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:22 And then real players
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:27 You get sent to 666
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:55 People at level 0 fight people who bought the game on day one
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:19:10 It doesn’t have a balance system
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:19:39 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:20:05 The real players bull dozes you so hard, i quit after three days of playing
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:20:18 im at level 5 for normandy
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:20:41 At least war thunder is slightly more balanced
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:20:50 a M5 can fighter a Tiger 1
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:20:56 that’s some bullshit
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:21:18 anyways
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:21:52 I made a P40 squadron, it’s not the best but it’s fun to have
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:22:20 Just seeing your wing man fall outta the sky is pretty cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:00 i did make a conversion to make them into P-51C instead but they look slightly too short
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:44 that’s… true
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:57 as planes, losing a wing isn’t death for some planes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:00 Like the spitfire
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:30 You mean your tail
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:47 what
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:51 excuse me
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:59 Do you mean
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:03 Control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:08 ah
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:17 You mean you lost your elevators
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:22 that’s normal
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:31 You can get back to the field without them
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:42 but try without the rudder or elevators
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:46 i almost did it once
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:50 stalled too hard
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:26:00 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:26:23 You’ll eventually get back down
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:26:43 actually, you could use slight flap for pitching up
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:26:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:27:00 Why are we texting this here
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:27:23 Good answer(excuse me, what went through my mind)
creations-chat 2022-09-07 14:07:14 i got addicted to war thunder so i haven't built a plane in months, ima go make a F2A-1 Buffalo
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:01:13 i've found a bug that when you first use a paint tool on a sign you can select the text inside and change it to what ever, im not sure if other people can see this though
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:02:49 forgot to mention inside top text, as you can see, filter does not work
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:04:15 oh yeah, that's actually really smart
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:06:01 ah yes, updates
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:06:39 i don't even know if they're suppose to be helping the game or breaking them now
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:07:07 i mean... yeah
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:07:45 more like sphagette
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:08:30 anyways, when will it exist?
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:09:22 i mean.. you aren't wrong
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:10:03 makes sense
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:11:00 true
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:13:16 actually- it's more like a new update
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:13:22 but as a new game
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:14:39 yeah, that's more true
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:17:15 isn't that an optional setting for newer models are am i just da stupid
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:19:20 oh schiebe, that's a good question
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:20:33 tbh
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:20:46 i think Aim 9 fits better
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:22:12 since i don't think that they will have the missile be able to be launched at sea level and go all the way to space and hit a fast jet because Phoenix got stupid tracking range(this is exaggerated, they don't have this much range)
bug-reports 2022-10-02 15:23:14 also if this is just a rewrite, i think the missiles will keep the close range tracking
bug-reports 2023-05-06 07:21:25 Great for when you want to make a B-17 with actual correct numbers of guns
