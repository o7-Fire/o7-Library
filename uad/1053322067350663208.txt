plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:11:07 Why does my jet have a stroke as soon as I go **near** water?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:11:34 It's a super modified version of the vulpen F-35A
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:12:52 But fr it's an odd glitch lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:13:53 I saw a kid trying to explain how him using a tutorial shredder makes him better than everyone, and how me killing or ignoring him is "cyberbullying"
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:14:46 Might build a mk2 airship
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:15:10 If you've ever seen a flying red and grey sausage with orange glass, that's my abomination

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:19:25 I built my airship cabin with working dials that show you stuff like gear location and doors so it's fully usable in 1st person
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:19:46 The glass design looks dope as hell
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:21:01 Ohno
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:22:47 Anyone agree with murdering shredder roaches?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:23:46 I kinda wanna make an anti shredder vehicle, any ideas? I might make a camera controlled speedy hover tank

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:12:27 Plus improved captain and crew visibility
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:13:00 No
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:13:16 Totally different lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:14:04 Although if I made the airship look more jet-like it would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:14:10 Futuristic airship
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:14:39 Oooo
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:15:02 What about a nacelle under the hull with a landing gear attached
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:15:13 Kinda vulnerable though

plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:45:16 I haven't got gravity slider so it'll be a jet or an airship
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:45:25 Dunno yet

plane-crazy 2023-06-27 12:57:38 <#384025409945337856> currently getting shit on by downvotes
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:00:55 not fully, i cvom,pletely gutted it and all that
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:01:18 i removed everything but parts of the body and re-did them
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:02:42 its now camera controlled, has more room efficient storage inside where i keep my rockets, ive actually changed the cockpt since then and adjusted the jet at the back
general 2023-06-27 13:25:22 Least toxic pc player
general 2023-06-27 13:26:06 I was thinking of those little missile bays on the side and I didn't know how to make it retractable. Might just remove it tbf
general 2023-06-27 13:27:07 Oh
general 2023-06-27 13:27:10 I'm dumb
general 2023-06-27 13:30:08 They aren't that good tbf
general 2023-06-27 13:30:32 I'm trying to fix his F-35 cos look at what he did to mah boy!
creations-chat 2023-06-27 13:31:28 Ok will do, sorry
general 2023-06-27 13:33:03 Actually they kinda do, I get to figure out the building process like how to lay out a good body plan and how they deal with wing angles
general 2023-06-27 13:34:05 That jet is the only tut I have. Typically I'll watch a tut but not build it and instead just learn how that kind of build works
general 2023-06-27 13:34:35 True
general 2023-06-27 13:34:59 I'm not a total noob at designing since I used to play a lot of ksp building jets
general 2023-06-27 13:35:48 Mf really said "cup"
general 2023-06-27 13:36:42 Cope
general 2023-06-27 13:37:29 I find building jets boring, I prefer airships, boats, subs and tanks
general 2023-06-27 13:37:52 Never using a tut for those lol

general 2023-06-27 13:47:06 Idk
general 2023-06-27 13:52:02 Imma go back to building the airship instead of that shitty half tut jet
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:54:19 id suppose
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:54:40 i cant decide how to do the back
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:55:10 any ideas?
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:55:22 wings, nacelles, a tail etc
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:55:35 its meant to be an airship
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:56:01 first version was a li'l too goofy
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:56:30 i might just use the back from this one on the new one
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 13:56:56 but with the changed dimensions
general 2023-06-27 13:57:57 happy international pineapple day guys!

plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:16:38 Btw this is my first kinda 1:1 scale build
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:17:01 I was building a giant airship but I gave up and started this and it's way more fun
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:17:25 Plus I was trolling a pc clan recruiter lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:17:52 If I'm becoming part of a group I'm making my own lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:18:08 I already own a group in another game lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:18:25 We could just spread to pc
general 2023-06-27 23:38:38 Any tips for building? My stuff looks like shid

plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:40 if i push the nose back i cant place the lights because of slabs being cringe
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:05:19 with using half wedge up it leaves a big gap between that and the interior blocks

plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:29:36 flaps too close together
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:30:01 its like a lever. the further away from the CoM you are, the more you turn
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:31:03 ohhhh
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:31:43 check if your engines line up wth your CoM
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:32:50 Y and X
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:33:12 left, right up and down needs to be close to the CoM so its in line with it
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:33:32 np

plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:43:21 still bad
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:44:03 the design has some promise though with the intake looking side windows
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:44:33 idk how to not make stuff blocky
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:45:14 
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:45:18 theres always this
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:47:39 vehicles like this is more fun imo
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:47:53 might use it to pull a big anti air railgun lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:48:33 i have a design thats just a super sized super modified nam nam railgun designed to spread out
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:48:57 this one is way better
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:25 that mf is cringe i agree
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:49:49 gladly
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:50:40 or you can use explosives to make a cloud of death
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:51:38 i like using mag guns cos i have a pretty good understanding of magnet guns in other games aswell
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:52:43 or use explosives to build a flak cannon
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:53:12 ive seen others build similar stuff and shot down a jet with it
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:54:09 the fact they are flying into your bombs kinda counters the bouncing issue
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:56:43 i thought because they are flying into the bomb and its coming towards them it might kinda counteract itself
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:04 what if i made it spin
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:29 aww
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 15:57:44 actually no it might if im adding ladders right at the end

creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:48:11 <@653231443937329174> I quite like your biplane, you just gotta improve the painting and add a li'l more detail. Still better than what I can do
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:51:04 Ok you have a point, most of the server members expect fucking art from a newbie
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:54:13 Man has a massive point.
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:01:47 Pc does have tedious building and a kinda toxic community, but imo it's "good enough". There are still quite a few members and players who will gladly help you learn the ropes and improve your building. Only downside is that it makes me feel like some kind of ADHD mf when I can't finish a build cos it doesn't look right

Also there are quite a few decent builds. Even if they are jagged and lack detail, they are still visually pleasing. That's just my honest neutral thought
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:04:47 I've played many similar games, and the balance between form and function IS super difficult to balance. Even triple A games end up with an ugly ass looking meta that everyone spams, so pc hasn't done that bad
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:07:17 I'm just trying rationalise the fact there's 2 polar opposite opinions here. The "plane crazy is a perfect god made game with nothing wrong and an angelic community" and then there's "everyone here is shit, shit builds, shit game"
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:20 Ok stop promoting this game. Go <#497142796961054721> or smth
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 10:36:36 Imma make a VTOL for the challenge. Including personal goals, it must:
-Be lift powered only
-Have retractable landing gears, preferably like legs
-be visually pleasing
-feature things that will aid in pvp
-look futuristic or dieselpunk
-be able to hover in place
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 10:37:07 Are hover engines allowed for steering as long as it doesn't contribute to lift?
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 10:39:28 Might take inspiration from the flying bozos (not the manhacks, the helis) from HL2

plane-crazy 2023-06-30 10:42:18 This bozo
general 2023-06-30 10:43:22 Ohno
general 2023-06-30 10:43:45 Iis that pc?
general 2023-06-30 10:44:33 I just wanted power tools, not a power b.tch
general 2023-06-30 10:46:01 Is there a p.rn site called ump or smth?
general 2023-06-30 10:46:31 Then why tf
general 2023-06-30 10:48:27 Hell naw
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 10:51:46 If so, then
1) create a 2 dimensional camera control drive
2) mount it to an airframe
3) build a rotor
4) adjust it until it can hover still

creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:19:17 why am I getting so heavily downvoted lol. Unlike yall shitty pvp jets its actually fun to use. Not the same copy pasted stuff that always gets upvoted into legend
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:21:19 yeah. This server can be pretty toxic lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 16:23:10 for the Vtol challenge are you allowed to use hover motor if it doesnt add to lift?
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:24:08 based individual, thx bro

plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:41:29 Super WIP
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:41:40 The orange is just a placeholder
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:42:05 Although it doesn't look bad so might just use a darker shade
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:43:17 Heavily based on this, but I'll certainly be deviating from it a lot until it's my own
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:43:58 Actually j plan on changing the front to feature a lot of antennas
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:44:25 I'm gonna do a different back
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:44:39 It's a lot shorter
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:44:59 And I'll probably put some kind of missiles on it
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:45:14 <@584060481522761728>
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:45:54 When I'm finishing it off I'll probably completely re-do the body
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:46:34 So that it's almost warhammer-like in places
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:46:50 Spikes, roof looking stuff etc
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:47:13 Ofc I'm adding a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 10:48:48 I don't like how blocky it is in places
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 12:23:00 That's the plan
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 12:25:16 should I make the roof pointy?
general 2023-07-01 21:08:25 spaceships need more love, more fun to fly and more powerful than jets
general 2023-07-01 21:09:05 hell yeah my dude

general 2023-07-01 21:09:33 good........

creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:24:15 why? You're a designer, give me some constructive criticism
creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:26:16 useless aah community downvoting for no reason 💀 it truly is a greenhouse of toxic kids lol

the-dump 2023-07-02 09:45:55 The reason why they failed to kill them darn blues is cos they weren't murikan 'nuff
creations-chat 2023-07-02 20:45:17 Yeah I plan on making a mk2. Less ugly front and more detail, aswell as VTOL and mabye improved weapons
creations-chat 2023-07-03 23:47:10 In my research, spacecraft can be as efficient as jets. Only difference is you can chill above spawn and use it like a Heli to murder newbies more efficiently.
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:43:48 lava doesnt destroy blocks, and you can literally go for a swim. Also it lets you jump super high for some reason
general 2023-07-04 14:44:13 guys you can go for a swim in lava
general 2023-07-04 14:44:33 and jump like the hulk and go 400 studs high
general 2023-07-04 14:46:30 anyone wanna go lava swimming with me?
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:53:30 what works?
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:19 thats the point
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:25 lava borke
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:45 its only in non-pvp mode btw
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:52 ok so
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:24 lava doesnt damage blocks or players, only charrs them
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:42 if you jump while in lava, you go 400 studs in the air
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:57 if you go into edit mode you'll still be on  fire
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:56:34 true
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:56:49 but the lava immunity and hulk jumpng doesnt seem intended
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:57:03 and this only works in non pvp mode
bug-reports 2023-07-04 15:38:53 got the lava bug now?
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:46:29 Lava doesn't hurt in non PvP
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:31 It should do though
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:40 ....
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:56 Bruh the lava pool doesn't do anything
