the-dump 2020-12-03 16:37:34 if thats considered nsfw then the gif above me is too
the-dump 2020-12-03 16:37:48 the only thing defining it as nsfw is the color theme

the-dump 2020-12-08 23:11:25 how is it not realistic to flick out a mag sideways
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:11:30 hold release and slant gun
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:15:49 should work for the AR style format of guns
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:16:55 yeah with the AR type locking mechanism for mags i meant
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:17:02 wont work for AK
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:17:05 (duh)
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:18:05 the mag is heavy enough to fall out by itself
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:18:08 i can say from experience
the-dump 2020-12-08 23:19:41 the only thing stopping it is the locking mechanism so maybe it was suppose to go out when flicked to the right??
