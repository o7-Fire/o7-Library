plane-crazy 2023-04-05 21:14:24 Inspired by the combine gunship
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 21:14:34 Idk i thought it would look cooler
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 21:14:50 And it doesn't change the weight

creations-chat 2023-04-05 23:10:26 Nice he-111 but the paint job looks like crap
creations-chat 2023-04-05 23:21:03 Me neither, the cockpit and the body are definitely way different
creations-chat 2023-04-05 23:42:06 MG rex i think?

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:01:15 Alright i shall change it to sand
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:08:22 Nah bruh metal is too heavy
the-dump 2023-04-06 00:34:03 
the-dump 2023-04-06 00:34:06 Hes so cute tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:35:09 Slate weights the same as default
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 00:35:17 So does sand i believe
creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:10:23 But what you did do is make that horrible he-111
creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:12:47 That was one build, and that f-117 wasnt made with commitment either
creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:15:55 I mean at least I post my builds instead of just shaming other people ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
creations-chat 2023-04-06 01:19:30 they don't have to be good, I just have to be happy about them,  I just wanted to know what other people thought about them, my fault i guess.

creations-chat 2023-04-07 17:14:43 You can make custom control surfaces or add propellors
creations-chat 2023-04-07 21:18:11 F
creations-chat 2023-04-08 10:48:51 If people want light builds why don‚Äôt they just use ballast blocks and set it to the lowest density instead of all ice

bot-central 2023-04-08 12:12:06 !rank
creations-chat 2023-04-08 12:15:41 I know
creations-chat 2023-04-09 11:05:16 Buff up the wing thickeness

creations-chat 2023-04-10 19:14:42 Halo ring
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:14:09 Am I the only one who thinks planes where your arms are sticking out of the cockpit looks bad
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:34:35 Its a game about blocks not a game about cylinders.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:36:52 which one?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 20:39:10 Its a DLC <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

I was joking.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 21:00:04 Nice f-15
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:47:37 Dont forget the 1 block wide cockpit.
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:53:43 Also dont forget the giant motorlocked bombs on the bottom of the wings
creations-chat 2023-04-21 13:58:58 I make railguns
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:55:42 People in creations chat talking bad about one exposed motor when their builds looking like the mirage 6900
creations-chat 2023-04-29 16:20:24 I also just dont put landing gears on some of my planes, of course later i add them but still
creations-chat 2023-04-29 16:30:00 If youre using regular landing gears you could cover it up with disconnecters, if its a custom gear you could use trapdoors as sort of a landing gear door or whatever its called
creations-chat 2023-05-02 23:50:51 Or flightpoint...
creations-chat 2023-05-02 23:53:14 Babft has crap physics
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:23:09 
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:23:12 I did it
creations-chat 2023-05-05 22:34:39 wow cargo door so cool (ik the rest of the build is bad, i just wanted a build with a cargo door)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 01:00:15 is this real
creations-chat 2023-06-12 00:06:36 Why is the ratio so high? Have you guys ever seen a combine gunship before?
creations-chat 2023-06-12 18:36:33 Hypocritical
creations-chat 2023-06-12 18:56:35 Hypocritical
creations-chat 2023-06-12 18:58:39 Hol up mb, for some reason your name was white earlier
general 2023-06-14 10:50:49 And they don‚Äôt do anything because of how plane crazy works
