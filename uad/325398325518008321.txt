creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:25:59 Even with all the folding, you could prob only have like 4 of the windows on the side
creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:26:18 If it was a team build
creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:26:21 That‚Äôs different
creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:26:28 That you could do
creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:26:56 Would be quite the project
creations-chat 2020-08-13 05:28:10 But the statues on it and stuff
