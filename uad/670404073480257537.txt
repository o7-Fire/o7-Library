bug-reports 2022-02-24 01:39:30 Sounds like a Rickje problem nglâ€¦
bug-reports 2022-02-24 02:19:08 https://tenor.com/view/funny-gif-23169978
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:21:16 Its only his game
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:22:00 Games only enjoyable when it works am i right?
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:22:24 None ðŸ¤“
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:22:40 Proveing his code dont work ðŸ—¿
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:23:29 Shouldnt the dev team even try to fix these?
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:23:50 Rick never even gives updates on pc2
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:24:05 Brother it has been 2 years since
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:24:24 We all expect even a little something from a game dev
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:25:01 Games like BRM has roadmaps to guide people through updates and whats being fixed or worked on
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:26:18 I can see he has another occupation but a way to counter that is people working with you
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:26:37 But we have not heard anything about his dev team
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:30:06 Guys.... pc2 is getting music!!!!!!!!!
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:30:18 Anything monumental?
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:30:33 Approx date?
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:31:36 Pc2 would be hella lit
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:32:05 But its hard to put faith in rick when the main game has bugs like this
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:32:31 Or at least some info on whats new or when its coming
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:32:54 For now we have no idea and we are getting the same two winter and summer maps
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:34:05 And ima be fr rn only reason why pc is very popular, its because it has no competitors
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:34:52 When is it coming out  ðŸ—¿
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:36:03 Gliding will be possible
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:36:07 Good date
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:37:13 Its been a year bro
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:37:36 Other games like it are showing up
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:37:48 Not popular sure
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:38:05 But in my opinion they are a lot better than the base game
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:38:13 And again
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:38:26 Everyone had been expecting it for a while now
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:39:21 I dont want pc2 to be rushed too but then again there is an issue with getting hyped for a year
bug-reports 2022-02-24 03:41:43 Thats the only option we have<:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>
