help 2021-08-31 04:19:12 Remove the part that folds and then rebuild it but pointing up and then have the motor join the main wing and the folding 0art together at either the back, front or middle of the fold line
help 2021-08-31 04:19:29 And make sure the motor can fold the wing tip

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:46:19 Mad respect if anyone can do that with a plane with more than just simple controls
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:46:42 I still see shredders in servers tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:46:59 Normal nuisance

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:32:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:33:15 How responsive is your aircraft for you tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:33:42 It seems that even my other phone that has basically nothing on it is still very laggy
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:33:57 Id be much better off controlling a ship or a boat
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:34:12 It's cool to the touch still
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:34:43 And I accidentally pressed the power button
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:34:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:34:55 Closed everything
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:35:10 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:35:18 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:36:34 And there's some spam bug thingy or idk what's it called in the server right beside me now
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:02 Greatest luck
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:29 It's a bunch of round things that look a little bit like wheels
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:37 I can't really tell what it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:46 But there's a lot of them
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:52 I can't it's on my other phone
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:37:59 And I don't have discord on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:38:21 It has a faulty charging port
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:38:29 Or a glitchy one
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:38:36 So that's why it's my 2nd phone
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:38:47 Its a hand me down
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:39:11 Basically
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:40:19 I got into my plane faster this time
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:40:33 The bug thing isn't there right now tho I think
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:40:46 It's a not PvP server
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:41:28 There's a big building beside me on the other side tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:41:37 Maybe a mall or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:43:29 Aight after this flight I'm going to PvP
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 04:46:35 Maybe I should practice more in non PvP

the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:24 My shoe is in the picture
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:45 I took a selfie in the bathtub too
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:54 I don't have the selfie tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:15:59 I deleted it
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:16:25 I have these tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:02 
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:12 Absolutely cursed image
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:20 That's from a few weeks ago
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:17:37 I found a picture of the bathtub tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:18:02 
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:03 On an Xbox 360 with a PS1 controller or something and a HP keyboard and monitor
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:33 Almost all of those shouldn't be there together
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:19:40 The monitor could be
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:20:56 Never too old to troll
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:23:00 Bite in the arse
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:31:43 Nokia case
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:32:15 I didn't even get to hear what it said
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:32:22 My sound is muted
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:33:02 Halal anime
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:34:01 What was the sound tho
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:36:07 DM the video I'm curious about what the audio was but I'll have to listen later
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:37:15 That's my aim
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:38:01 Idk I still have volume muted so idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 05:39:23 You could counter the lift somehow
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:41:49 Thought it's just me but I guess it's all of discord (took 2 or 3 resends to send that)
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:13 Discord has gone oof again
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:24 Like usual
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:43:32 Oh I think it's fixed
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:08 Back on the wheel thing
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:20 Generating power for the servers
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:35 Probably was a shift change
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:44:55 Evening shift hamster left and night shift Hampstead came
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:45:04 But night shift hamster was late
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:46:28 If both hamsters run then power overload and discord becomes dwascord
the-dump 2021-09-01 05:46:44 Simple
the-dump 2021-09-01 16:28:12 right its cursed
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 19:10:24 when making a plane like an f15 how wide should the nose/cockpit area be
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 19:10:31 in plane crazy blocks
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:45:17 Downloaded it and looked at it all frame by frame
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:09 Most worrying part is that some of the even most random stuff I've done before
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:32 
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:46:57 Right how many days have I been doing that for
the-dump 2021-09-01 22:47:05 I lost count

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:03:12 its something like a screen
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:03:25 then the whole canopy is like a hud
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:03:47 na m8 its anime logic
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:04:41 well the point of the anima(the plane girls) and daughters(the special planes) are to fight some alien like things that use some emp like thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:05:01 and then theres just anime logic
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:05:59 punch a tree
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:06:27 break a 1m cubed section of the tree and the rest stays as it is
