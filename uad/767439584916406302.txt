general 2021-06-05 23:29:49 i feel like these days in plane crazy theres just a lot of "weapons on wheels" in pvp servers(basically just a 2 second build consisting of as many weapons as possible on a motor)
general 2021-06-05 23:30:02 there should be like leveled pvp servers or something
general 2021-06-05 23:30:03 idk

general 2021-06-17 19:58:39 huh
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:55:36 lol
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:59:02 hmmm
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:01:14 if you were making it bigger you could use half block down 1x2s and then pyramid wedges to make it look the most realistic

but obviously thats on a larger scale build
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:11:31 that looks good except for the thousands of guns on the turrets and then obviously you're planning to paint it different from just plain white right?


try putting the guns in the turrets via motorlocking or just putting less guns in
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:13:59 what kidn of boat are you basing this off of? a destroyer?

<@!812089451450466364> edit your message instead of waiting for another minute
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:19:20 Need feedback on my destroyer, I'm not sure what else to add. I have lifeboats and guided missiles as well as torpedoes and turrets. (and interior) (also my skin is minecraft steve)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 16:22:00 ok so ill smooth the front and try to fix up that front gun and also add some more detail on the side

general 2021-07-03 21:49:13 epic big secret
general 2021-07-03 21:49:41 brooo i hope they make plots bigger
general 2021-07-03 21:49:49 actually
general 2021-07-03 21:50:01 rickje and the other people working on it
general 2021-07-03 21:50:15 idk if it would be good or bad
general 2021-07-03 21:50:25 bc smaller plots makes bigger builds harder to make
general 2021-07-03 21:50:38 i just hope they fix the lag issue
general 2021-07-03 21:50:40 with big builds
general 2021-07-03 21:50:42 like man
general 2021-07-03 21:50:49 i have a battleship thats like 5k blocks
general 2021-07-03 21:50:54 and it is laggy af
general 2021-07-03 21:51:15 they should make it so each plot is in a hanger or something
general 2021-07-03 21:51:17 that would be cool
general 2021-07-03 21:51:25 like a big hanger
general 2021-07-03 21:51:54 yea jkinda
general 2021-07-03 21:51:56 so idk
general 2021-07-03 21:52:02 i just want big builds to be less lagy'
general 2021-07-03 21:52:39 yea
general 2021-07-03 21:54:12 if plots are smaller
general 2021-07-03 21:54:15 big builds are harder
general 2021-07-03 21:54:34 which makes them rarer
general 2021-07-03 21:54:42 and in turn more of a challenge
