general 2020-12-02 22:25:01 They gotta add a feature
general 2020-12-02 22:27:55 So basically, a feature where you can have mini deployable (Flyable) fighters that can fly out of your hangar/build. Cuz I have a space ship. And I want it so my friends can get into prebuilt planes on my build and take off. But the problem is that when I try to make a disconnector and then fly type of the plane it dose not fly. since the blue dot and the yellow dot do not line up. So can they fix it. Also I don't know how to add this to suggestions. Also one way to fix this is when you can configure a pilot seat to have its own aerodynamics like the blue and yellow lines and dot things. So it can actually fly.
