creations-chat 2020-10-30 13:41:52 ive been working on my new ship for like 9 hours so far

general 2020-10-31 20:32:14 ok, thnaks
general 2020-10-31 20:33:07 i have 6700 blocks on my new ship so far
general 2020-10-31 20:50:42 discord is weird in light mode
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 06:41:16 im almost done with my ship
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 06:42:17 it's full of detail
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 06:45:00 i'm up too damn late
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 06:56:26 one more day of work and my ship will be done

plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:01:15 just enable motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:01:45 when you motor lock, whatever position you stop moving your motor will be it's permanent position until you move it yourself
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:02:13 think of motor locking as putting glue on a hinge
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:02:23 it won't move from that position
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:02:31 unless you move the motor again
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:03:17 torque is how hard it turns
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:03:27 how much power it can have while turning
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:00 learn
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:06 strive to learn
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:08 look to learn
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:22 don't ask jsut in the server or discord, look for tutorials on youtube
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:42 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:45 i have no words
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:04:48 i can say fuck
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:05:01 ok then
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:05:07 this server's filter is kinda confusing
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:05:20 anyway
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:05:23 use the internet
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 07:05:30 it's perfect for things like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:17:37 im making a mil v-12
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:15:51 the helicopter im making is gonna be basic and mostly detail lacking, but a fully functional helicopter non the less
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:15:58 and my second helicopter attempt
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:19:08 making this monstrosity
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:21:37 no, that's rotodyne
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:21:41 which was my first attempt
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:21:46 didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:22:26 this is heliplane
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:31:30 nothing can move the motor except the button used to move it being pushed
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:31:36 so it wont hinge freely
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:34:11 ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:34:47 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:35:05 you can configure your control  surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 21:35:12 so you use your keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 22:09:05 madattack y u do dis
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:09:07 finished the helicopter, now im just balancing it out
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:09:58 i wish there was a way to introduce throttles to motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:11:07 what kind of build?
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:13:52 royal
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:13:58 tell us thy issue
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:14:51 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:16:54 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:16:58 it's all subjective
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:17:01 infinite iq
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:21:25 what is it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:37:54 finished the mil v12
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:38:01 my first successful helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:38:33 sure
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:39:22 it's very basicthough
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:39:29 not the msot detailed
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:39:39 k
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:39:53 gimme a while, my pc i use for games is slow on chrome
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:39:58 or internet in general
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:42:36 
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:43:18 im still having slight issues with control
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:43:25 msot likely the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:43:42 i have no planes to build other helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:43:49 i ocne tried rotodyne, but it didn't work out
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:44:02 it's half heli half air liner
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:44:14 well
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:44:15 yea
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:44:22 i.
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:44:29 i cannot argue with that logic
general 2020-11-01 23:48:27 no one lieks the mil v-12
general 2020-11-01 23:48:31 everyone here is very strict
general 2020-11-01 23:48:43 war thunder?
general 2020-11-01 23:48:59 ouch
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:49:29 no one likes the mil v-12
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:49:34 everyone here is really strict
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:50:09 yea, but it's msotly downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 23:50:34 at least it's honest
general 2020-11-01 23:50:47 bs

plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:16:24 badass
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:20:10 the heli i made is extremly hard to cotnrol
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:20:23 and if you try to turn, you can't regain control, it'll dive and rise
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:20:52 and if you do somehow manage to regain control whiel turning, it'll just revert back to the direction it was facing before you wanted to turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:21:33 
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:21:50 no side view
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:22:08 those two rotors are the only way to control it
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:22:12 and i didn't get a side view
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:23:33

plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:30:43 i can fly forward and backward easily
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 00:31:01 but if i turn, it'll start pitching to the side and it won't recover

plane-crazy 2020-11-10 21:31:42 is your center of balance in the center of your vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 21:32:08 place your rotors on the very point of your center of balance
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 21:32:24 do it last so that it works well
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 21:33:30 balance is extraordinarily important in helicopters

creations-chat 2020-11-18 03:59:28 Hey <@!456137975894507521> , what's wrong with the aircraft?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:00:59 As well as everyone else who has downvoted it, what's wrong with it?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:02:42 the plane was blocky irl VVVVV thanks, I dont have a set scale per block, and I intend on more detail in the future when I can get it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:04:39 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:06:12 yea, i thought i made the fuselage too long. I have no set scale for builds, I need one though, thanks for the tips
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:07:44 OH. I misread the comment above, it said tail wing not fuselage. VVVVV and yes, the back angle is too much. (what are vent wings?)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:09:50 I reversed engineerd planes Ive seen from a while back, and this is literally my second plane. I have bad experience with normal wing panels because my first planes from a long time ago were realistic wings but their roll rate was horrible. (thanks though, notes taken, Ill modify the design) (** I have bad experiences with using the keyboard to control planes in this game**)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:11:45 yea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:19:02 i made a mil v-12, but people didn't like it because it's low detail
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:26:26 also, is the fuselage too tall on the zeppelin staaken?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:33:05 > this doesn't look as blocky, plus the tail wing on yours is longer and smaller than what it should be, especially the nose having a wedge at the ends of the nose
<@!614659754249420810> Context on "smaller than it should be"?
general 2020-11-25 20:31:07 guys guess what
general 2020-11-25 20:31:29 some idiot said that madattack would have a talk with me because the guy said that My build lags his slow pc
general 2020-11-25 20:31:45 lol
general 2020-11-25 20:31:49 wait
general 2020-11-25 20:32:11 but my build isn't an intentional lag machine

general 2020-11-25 20:37:45 so
general 2020-11-25 20:37:55 when did madattack say that he would talk to people with large builds?
general 2020-11-25 20:38:03 and in what context?
general 2020-11-25 20:38:08 because this worries me
general 2020-11-25 20:38:14 ok
general 2020-11-25 20:38:26 then why the hell did someone say that he did

general 2020-11-26 06:52:06 I wish that control surfaces worked with folding
general 2020-11-26 06:53:25 when you have folding creations, control surfaces do not work on the parts that fold. I have folding wings, so the parts of the wings that fold do not have functional control surfaces

creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:05:30 I do know how to make custom control surfaces, but they're difficult for me to operate so i prefer vent wings for maneuverability
creations-chat 2020-11-27 06:08:30 Just appreciate it for it's damn survivability (it's missing its tail, half of its right wing is clipped and its bottom of torn up.)

general 2020-11-29 02:44:23 mini modding is not against the rules, but over doing it is
general 2020-11-29 02:44:53 vanq
general 2020-11-29 02:45:24 it is not against the rules to mini mod. It is blatantly said that mini modding to an extent is helpful to the staff, but over doing it is not allowed

creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:43:00 Can I get some criticism on my build? If you downvote a build but don't say why, it's pointless to downvote. I find it extraordinarily stupid of people to downvote a build but not give a reason why.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:51:16 <@!551806781609869313> that's the problem. No one gives a damn opinion when they downvote, that's what get's me. (and to theloud, i meant on the bow, trying the wedgework)

VV then they should say why so it can be improved. This channel is for that purpose but no one uses it when they downvote something.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:53:57 so, you're not liking something, and you give no reason why. sounds dumb.
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:55:59 yea box, i was wondering what was wrong with the shieldhall i built
creations-chat 2020-12-14 23:58:16 Ok, fair enough. it's a downsized ship too, so i didn't have room for detail. lack of plans too. I can get a draft view though.
creations-chat 2020-12-15 00:03:01 hey, dood, imma get you a draft photo

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:52:59 that's what i do for tanks
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:53:15 with Q and A for the left side and E and D for the right side
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:46:42 If im not mistaken, blast presure is how much pressure is exerted from the explosion outwards. More pressure means more damage.
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:46:52 in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:48:13 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:48:49 something about more pressure having more force to commit destruct
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:53:27 i just hover around people who mass blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:53:53 if they're making something like a rocket, ill get my airship and go directly above their plot and anchor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:54:41 Most of the reason why people mass blacklist apparently is to not draw attention. Turns out a giant red box does the exact opposite
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 05:56:09 have you guys seen the zeppelin in the <#627195143040139264> ?

plane-crazy 2021-02-20 02:52:48 some people will, others will just ignore you
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 02:53:10 mostly depends on what time you ask, but room wise, any room is good

plane-crazy 2021-12-14 18:52:07 No
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 18:52:12 That's not real
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:48:18 Roblox also hates jews
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:48:34 They censor any form of jew
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:48:37 Try it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:48:53 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:49:10 They're history incompetent too
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:49:33 Ah, hold on
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:49:55 To roblox, the iron cross is just the finny mustache man symbol
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:50:09 It's ridiculous
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:51:01 Remember when roblox had actual staff and not the people who didn't get accepted into twitch moderation?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:52:31 It's so bad that it's likely that they just sit anyone infront of a conputer, with no training whatsoever, and say, "make yourself at home"
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:52:53 Is that legit?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:54:11 My fellow robloxians. For too long we have suffered terrible moderation. We must rebel and take back our rights to call people gay in chat.
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 06:55:16 Legit
