The Tale of modnar411 (597188078670577668)
help 2020-07-04 23:46:30 I don‚Äôt necessarily have anything to post an image of but I have a question. I want to figure out how to make a solid bodied craft that follows my cursor. Not a shredder bug, not a turret. How can I make a plane that follows my mouse?
help 2020-07-04 23:46:43 Any tutorials or simple tips y‚Äôall could lead me too?
help 2020-07-04 23:48:41 Well could you be a bit more specific?
help 2020-07-04 23:49:32 I don‚Äôt mean how to use them, I know how to make a shredder bug and stuff like that but how would I make like a plane or something that follows my mouse
help 2020-07-04 23:49:36 Like a jet
help 2020-07-04 23:49:44 Do you know any tutorials?
help 2020-07-04 23:56:11 Control panel
help 2020-07-04 23:56:19 Is that a part?
help 2020-07-04 23:56:42 I‚Äôm sorry im not looking at my computer rn and don‚Äôt know exactly what u r talking about
help 2020-07-04 23:57:27 And how do I get them to move with my cursor?
help 2020-07-04 23:57:45 Oh
help 2020-07-04 23:57:46 Ok
help 2020-07-04 23:58:06 What setting do I put the control panels on
help 2020-07-04 23:58:17 What key
help 2020-07-04 23:58:28 Oh
help 2020-07-04 23:58:49 I did not know that
help 2020-07-04 23:59:00 No no
help 2020-07-04 23:59:08 I know where to place control panels
help 2020-07-04 23:59:20 I just didn‚Äôt know they follow my mouse
help 2020-07-05 00:00:38 Did it explain that in the tutorial
help 2020-07-05 00:00:44 How to make it follow ur mouse
help 2020-07-05 00:02:25 Ok
help 2020-07-05 00:02:29 Thanks a lot
help 2020-07-05 00:02:31 üôÇ
general 2020-07-05 17:48:16 Sweeto you there?
general 2020-07-06 02:32:56 No images yet, in the process of making a chopper
general 2020-07-06 02:33:02 Chomper*
general 2020-07-06 02:33:08 An anti shredder
general 2020-07-06 02:33:47 Lmao
general 2020-07-06 14:30:50 I came up with an idea for a build and I‚Äôm gonna get to construction soon
general 2020-07-06 14:31:10 Would you like to hear the gist of it?
general 2020-07-06 14:32:25 <@!515793531017887756> kinda but not really
general 2020-07-06 14:33:28 The creation is essentially a big mouth, a 4 jawed chomper, using motors of course that can swing forward an back. I‚Äôm over explaining this but it‚Äôs essentially just 4 jaws lined with cutters
general 2020-07-06 14:33:46 Then you add some ballasts to the bottom and you let it sink underwater
general 2020-07-06 14:34:27 You open up your jaws and wait until a ship comes over, you rise up and let go and then you bassically take down the ship in one bite
general 2020-07-06 14:34:42 You‚Äôre undetected and hard to hit,
general 2020-07-06 15:59:57 Version 1 is complete
general 2020-07-06 16:31:41 I built a litteral nightmare
general 2020-07-06 16:31:52 With only one weakness being rockets
general 2020-07-06 16:34:09 The build is dubbed the Leviathan
general 2020-07-07 22:35:12 I‚Äôm in the planning stages of a new ‚Äúbiological‚Äù build
general 2020-07-07 22:35:36 I‚Äôve named it the Abbysal1 and it‚Äôs one of my deep sea vehicles
general 2020-07-07 22:35:46 Feul
general 2020-07-07 22:36:26 The Abbysal1 is essentially a sub but it has a tail and a pair of jaws
general 2020-07-07 22:36:53 So the sea dragon Leviathan lmao
general 2020-12-19 15:33:35 I built a cube and now have followers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:51:51 I am very happy
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:52:00 I am becoming a lord of cubes
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:52:14 I‚Äôm so glad I figured out how to make them, they are the perfect anti shredder
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:52:19 The yin to a yang
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:55:03 I am spreading the cube lord religion
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:55:08 Why, I don‚Äôt know
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 15:55:22 Like a midair bomber?
general 2021-01-04 02:55:00 Well I never thought I‚Äôd get here but I‚Äôve gone from shredders, to jets, to mega builds in less that 5 days
general 2021-01-04 02:55:35 Antishredders
general 2021-01-04 02:55:40 *wink*
general 2021-01-04 02:56:10 Well I for a while couldn‚Äôt find any other way to kill em, I made a friend tho and he inspired me to make some keys
general 2021-01-04 02:56:13 Jets*
general 2021-01-04 02:56:38 So now I have a gunship, b29, another gunship, cargo bomber and like 3 keys
general 2021-01-04 02:56:41 Jets*
general 2021-01-04 02:56:45 I‚Äôm happy
general 2021-01-04 02:57:11 I‚Äôm in my bed rn, i will in the morning
general 2021-01-04 02:57:22 I‚Äôm actually quite proud of my b29
general 2021-01-04 02:57:49 I named her Saturn and gave her a futuristic cyan and crimson wing tip paint job with checkers and yellow props
general 2021-01-04 02:57:58 You can get ranks,
general 2021-01-04 02:58:10 Yeah,
general 2021-01-04 02:58:23 Light blue on the front of the wings and red in the back
general 2021-01-04 02:58:30 Steel grey body tho
general 2021-01-04 02:58:44 *THE COLORS ARE JUST HIGHLIGHTS PLEASE DONT HURT ME*
general 2021-01-04 02:59:03 Well I came here to say
general 2021-01-04 02:59:40 I want to build a Nuke, shredder nuke
general 2021-01-04 03:00:22 So what I‚Äôm planning on doing, is making a silo that sinks underwater
general 2021-01-04 03:01:36 The bomb will essentially be a stick of bombs wrapped in cutters and a nice shell
general 2021-01-04 03:01:44 Wasd controls obviously
general 2021-01-04 03:01:46 XD
general 2021-01-04 03:01:59 I‚Äôve lucid dreamt thrice
general 2021-01-04 03:02:12 If you count sleep paralysis as lucid
general 2021-01-04 03:03:33 any tips for nukes?
general 2021-01-04 03:03:59 Not for lag purposes,
general 2021-01-04 03:04:11 **the last, possible resort**
general 2021-01-04 03:04:21 I guess that‚Äôs true
general 2021-01-04 03:04:33 You need a lot of cutters but then square cube law and sad
general 2021-01-04 03:04:43 Only at quite close range
general 2021-01-04 03:04:59 but then we are just building missiles
general 2021-01-04 03:05:30 Because im **a r e b e l** I shan‚Äôt listen to yas
general 2021-01-04 03:07:20 From now on I‚Äôm referring to anti shredders as
general 2021-01-04 03:07:37 Shredder Annihilation Device
general 2021-01-04 03:07:37 Annihalation*
general 2021-01-04 03:07:37 S.A.D Shredder, Anti, Device
general 2021-01-04 03:08:07 I think il sleep now
general 2021-01-04 03:08:08 XD
general 2021-01-04 03:08:33 I have like a introduction day
general 2021-01-04 03:08:47 In Canada we are in another lockdown
general 2021-01-04 03:08:56 Like 5 weeks of full online
general 2021-01-04 03:09:17 Sorry sir not
general 2021-01-04 03:09:37 I‚Äôm surprised because Canada‚Äôs population density is
general 2021-01-04 03:09:40 *thin*
general 2021-01-04 03:09:59 Well anyhow
general 2021-01-04 03:10:10 Time to dream about tactically nuking shredders
general 2021-01-04 03:10:28 **and taking revenge on the soup bombers who wouldn‚Äôt even let my b29 take off**
general 2021-01-04 03:11:02 man that‚Äôs what I did
general 2021-01-04 03:11:07 THEY WERE EVERYWHERE
general 2021-01-04 03:11:11 Well anywho
general 2021-01-04 03:11:16 I have to go sleepy
general 2021-01-04 03:11:19 Gn
general 2021-01-04 03:11:42 XD
general 2021-01-04 13:14:06 E
general 2021-01-04 13:14:12 Are you still all typing
general 2021-01-04 13:14:20 My goodness
general 2021-01-04 13:21:02 Turns out I have no calls today
general 2021-01-04 13:21:09 Time to build a nuke, also
general 2021-01-04 13:21:24 I found a way to deal with underwater turret spammers
general 2021-01-04 13:21:35 If you‚Äôve ever encountered them,
general 2021-01-04 13:22:52 Make a cargo bomber, replace bombs for ballast blocks with cutters attached, blacklist the turret ,
general 2021-01-04 13:40:30 Do I hate lag machine users
general 2021-01-04 13:40:40 Yes I do
general 2021-01-04 14:26:59 What is the optimal amount of bombs
general 2021-01-04 14:27:15 In the sense that, what is a dangerous amount that isn‚Äôt too laggy
general 2021-01-04 14:27:29 I‚Äôm planning on making a Valkyrie style supersonic bomber
general 2021-01-04 14:28:17 I made a ‚ÄúStealth‚Äù gunship with all its weaponry hidden in a bomb bay
general 2021-01-04 14:29:23 I prefer hover drives, sleeker and less laggy, sometimes faster too
general 2021-01-04 14:29:30 They require more space tho
general 2021-01-04 14:29:48 Lighter smaller builds work better with hovers IMO
general 2021-01-04 14:31:05 XD
general 2021-01-04 14:31:13 Has anyone made Cubes here
general 2021-01-04 14:31:16 Mwahahahahah
general 2021-01-04 14:32:45 I‚Äôm confused horrified and arou-amused at the same time
general 2021-01-07 17:34:37 I think I should try moto locking
general 2021-01-07 17:34:40 Motor*
general 2021-01-07 17:35:34 I feel like making a hypersonic motor locked jet
general 2021-01-07 17:35:41 With completely concealed weapons
general 2021-01-07 17:56:15 Important question, do you think that in the future (cuz they already are kinda) all fighter jets will incorporate heavy stealth tech
general 2021-01-07 17:56:53 XDddddd
general 2021-01-07 17:57:53 Don‚Äôt you hate it when the game lags so mu you spawn in the middle of the snowfield
general 2021-02-16 00:19:56 Does a hate symbol qualify as reportable?
general 2021-02-16 00:20:13 How do I?
general 2021-02-16 00:20:26 Can I ask you to report a person?
general 2021-02-16 00:21:29 Well who has the permissions to ban someone,
general 2021-02-16 00:22:01 Because there is a person using hate symbols, speaker spamming and just in general being a real disturbance
general 2021-02-16 00:22:11 He/she has insulted like half of the server
general 2021-02-16 00:22:59 Oh I can‚Äôt say that word I guess
general 2021-02-16 00:24:11 Well maybe not a ban
general 2021-02-16 00:24:18 Can I say his name?
general 2021-02-16 00:24:35 sparklengh
general 2021-02-16 00:25:04 I‚Äôve only seen a few of these people
general 2021-02-16 00:27:39 Alright, I sent a complaint. Not that I expect for it to be responded to
general 2021-02-16 00:57:41 I think I just accidentally lagged a server out
general 2021-02-16 00:57:52 I put too many engines on my darn creation
general 2021-02-16 00:58:30 I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, it was not intentional
general 2021-02-16 00:59:03 Why is the engine limit 2000? 
Just saying
general 2021-02-16 00:59:37 Lmao
general 2021-02-16 01:00:23 I don‚Äôt come her often enough to know rules smh
general 2021-02-16 01:00:27 Here*
general 2021-02-16 01:00:40 Why
general 2021-02-16 01:00:54 What is that?
general 2021-02-16 01:02:57 Man my computer died
general 2021-02-16 01:03:32 Yikes that‚Äôs one plane I wouldn‚Äôt want to be at the back in
creations-chat 2021-02-16 21:23:59 If say looks better
creations-chat 2021-02-16 21:26:00 Maybe a half block at the front tho? I wasn‚Äôt finished, like slant it maybe
bug-reports 2021-02-16 21:34:52 So not too sure how this works but:
Bug 1: When servers get laggy enough you respawn in either the central fields or the slate area.
Bug 2: Sometimes if you choose your spawn as water or airport when you des pawn you won‚Äôt get teleported back.
Bug 3: Sometimes when a block gets deleted in build mode you can‚Äôt place anything in its place, and you have to respawn once or twice to be able to place blocks in the hole again.
Bug 4: If you don‚Äôt set a motor 2 to servo and it has an engine strapped to it (any propulsion) it will disappear or fly away as soon as you touch the water.
An example of this is a super rocket engine on a rudder.
That‚Äôs all for now
bug-reports 2021-02-16 21:38:24 These were all found within reasonable wifi, and high graphics settings
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:54:43 So this question has a pretty darn simple awnser but I can‚Äôt get any aeronautical roles because all my builds use helium. I use the helium so that my builds can fly slow enough to walk around in them, like a b-29 with a full interior.
Could I still get the role or no?
(Walk around mid-flight I mean)
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:56:11 Darn
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:56:14 I‚Äôm sad
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:56:22 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:57:40 Je n‚Äôaime pas la fran√ßais, je suis en inmersion
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:58:15 Donc je peu parl√© un peu, mais √† formation est horrible
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:58:27 I‚Äôm not good at French, 
**at all**
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 00:58:52 What‚Äôs it‚Äôs counterpart then?
I don‚Äôt know
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:00:11 I don‚Äôt speak French as a first language. 
Save the correcting for someone who is wayyyyyy more developed language wise
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:00:13 XD
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:01:11 Damn
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:01:44 Also my English keyboard always ruins French when it comes to pass√© compos√©
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:01:52 No hablo Espa√±ol
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:02:12 Yo solo hablo ingles
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:02:14 I think
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:03:21 Yo means me, solo means only, ingles mean English, hablo means speak
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:03:22 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:03:34 I can‚Äôt speak German
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:04:12 Although in my head Klaus and Sphen are defending the beaches. (Two of-
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:04:21 I‚Äôm realizing this isn‚Äôt plane crazy related
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:05:05 Me niether
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:05:31 Hmmm, I think I‚Äôm going to build a vtol next
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:06:05 I think I‚Äôm going to try to build a 4 thruster troop carrier
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:06:18 Or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:06:51 Yeah I guess
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:07:05 Or maybe a ground assault vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:07:30 I‚Äôve gotten great at making sleek turret designs, but haven‚Äôt tried with missiles
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:08:42 Explain this story fully
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:08:48 Please.
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:09:05 XD
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:09:53 I think I‚Äôm gonna try to make the cod vtol
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:10:07 
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:10:30 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:10:51 Honestly the hardest part will be configuring ballasts and
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:10:58 **helium**
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:11:05 But that will disqualify me from stuff
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:12:22 I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at it, I build a lot of big aircraft and subs. I‚Äôve gotten used to configure helium so my builds can fly level even when not in the cockpit, and need very little adjustment
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:12:42 I like making slower builds, so that people can walk around without getting yeeted
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:12:59 But since it‚Äôs for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:13:08 I guess I should make an exception
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:13:23 Ice and motor 2s do not work well together
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:13:33 *especially underwater*
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:13:38 Atleast for me
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:13:54 Good point
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:14:29 Also, like any ice makes ballast/helium configuration more difficult because builds can get unstable, as they travel faster
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:14:35 But il take that into consideration
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:15:33 Ummm
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:15:36 Any helium?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:15:39 Probably
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:16:47 He
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:16:50 Ye*
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:17:07 Alright my friends
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:17:21 It‚Äôs time to put in some music and ball my eyes out making this vtol
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:17:29 K
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:18:08 That‚Äôs a fine airship
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:18:16 I‚Äôm not too sure what rank it would have though
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:20:31 But helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:20:56 Yeah because of helium there‚Äôs a bit of a problem
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:22:25 How do I submit suggestions?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:32:28 Alright beginning work on the vtol
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:32:55 ^^^^^^
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:34:07 Any tips for vtol before I begin?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:34:14 Just ballasts right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:34:58 I‚Äôm not going to do any research
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:05 Just blueprints of a fake creation
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:44 I‚Äôm just making some swivel nozzles
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:49 
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:35:51 This bad boy
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:36:29 I made a heli once, it looked really good. I never finished and deleted it. then I got sad
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:37:18 Well I‚Äôm going to be a stubborn bumm and not listen to any of the help I‚Äôve been given
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:37:23 I am having a wonderful day
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:37:34 Begin
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:38:04 Well plane crazy physics are simplified
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:38:17 Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but: if I get the ballast ratio right
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:38:19 I‚Äôm all good
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:38:39 I send my prayers to you
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:38:45 Yikes, that sounds not fun
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:39:05 *i am a true slacker*
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:40:00 I just realized
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:40:04 Landing will be hard
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:40:19 I will need to be so delicate with my elevator maneuvers
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:41:13 Actually I haven‚Äôt tried this but: make elevators with two motors attached, and set it to wasd and tfgh, so you have turns and hard turns
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:42:18 Hmmm, I can take some artistic liberty as no one else has done this before
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:42:21 That‚Äôs posted
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 01:42:23 I think
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:24:41 So I give up
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:24:49 Way inexperienced for the vtol from cod
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:25:08 And I told lots of my builds but at that point it‚Äôs too big to be practical
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:26:40 I love baiting shredders
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:27:07 If you have good FPS you can make a trapper, essentially a large two or 4 jawed bear trap Nader the water
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:27:19 Then make a lil boat and sit in it, shredder bait
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:27:39 If you do it right you can smack the shredder to hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 18:58:04 Well now I‚Äôm sad
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 18:58:46 My vtol doesn‚Äôt work and I‚Äôm. It too sure why. It keeps rolling to the right
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 18:58:58 I‚Äôm*
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 19:02:13 No
general 2021-02-18 19:44:56 Hey has anyone here made a vtol before?
general 2021-02-18 19:45:42 I tried making a vtol earlier, mind you that wings weren‚Äôt added yet. It was a circular two ‚Äúramjet‚Äù design on each wing kinda.
general 2021-02-18 19:45:47 It kept rolling to the right
general 2021-02-18 19:45:55 And it should have been perfectly balanced,
general 2021-02-18 19:46:11 And I was using rocket engines,
general 2021-02-18 19:46:16 Yeah it had seats in it
general 2021-02-18 19:46:37 I was seated at the center of it
general 2021-02-18 19:46:47 So with no one else in the craft it should have been balanced
general 2021-02-18 19:46:52 Roll-wise
general 2021-02-18 19:48:34 Well the terrorists know that everyone with glasses is an anime protagonist and could dodge the bullets
general 2021-02-18 19:48:35 Duh
general 2021-02-18 19:52:21 So could anyone help?
general 2021-02-18 19:52:42 XD
general 2021-02-18 19:52:59 Il make a video
general 2021-02-18 19:54:11 Where would I post a shorter clip? Not in the videos channel I assume
help 2021-02-18 19:54:53 Alright I‚Äôm here
help 2021-02-18 19:55:52 Just saying that it‚Äôs only the body I have completed currently. The engines are the only other part attach. You will notice small wings on the ends of the boosters or whatever, they do not affect the rolling as it did so before I added them
help 2021-02-18 19:58:37 Hold on
help 2021-02-18 19:58:46 I might have resolved the issue
help 2021-02-18 19:59:01 I was gonna ask for help because my vtol kept rolling to the left
help 2021-02-18 19:59:07 Right*
help 2021-02-18 20:00:41 I turned it to both for the time settings and tried to look at the shadows cast and see if there were any differences. It should be perfectly symmetrical
help 2021-02-18 20:00:47 No one was in it beside me either
help 2021-02-18 20:02:09 I was going to take a video but since it‚Äôs my phone it looked quite sloppy and I think I resolved the issue
help 2021-02-18 20:02:13 If it happens again I will
help 2021-02-18 20:02:29 This
help 2021-02-18 20:03:00 Not even too sure, I added some control surfaces on the end
help 2021-02-18 20:03:03 Maybe that
help 2021-02-18 20:03:17 More or less
help 2021-02-18 20:03:36 Before I do more tests I need to configure ballasts and my pitch and yaw
help 2021-02-18 20:03:42 Because I can barely take off atm
help 2021-02-18 20:04:47 Also this vtol might look sloppy, it‚Äôs supposed to be a test really
help 2021-02-18 20:05:08 I‚Äôm even using control surfaces smh
help 2021-02-18 20:05:59 It‚Äôs completely fictional, and I mean the block type
help 2021-02-18 20:06:11 Instead of using servo motors to control the plane I‚Äôm using cursor
help 2021-02-18 20:06:30 Lemme see some
help 2021-02-18 20:06:43 Oh XD
help 2021-02-18 20:07:00 That‚Äôs sick
help 2021-02-18 20:07:03 Full interior?
help 2021-02-18 20:08:07 That‚Äôs cool
help 2021-02-18 20:08:21 Oh damn
help 2021-02-18 20:08:24 That‚Äôs sleek
bug-reports 2021-02-19 13:58:36 I prefer it. I make lots of submarines and will attach a little glass viewfinder with a camera and motor at the top. I forget what they are called,
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 13:59:59 I think it looks ok, most of it will be under the water too
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:00:07 Also how do you do those lil stickers
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:00:50 Stickers how
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:01:06 On pc?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:01:13 Aight thx
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:45:02 Woohooo built my first vtol!
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:45:13 Uses helium tho so no rank
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:45:55 Red
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:13:21 It will come soon enough XD
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:15:24 I have to copy them into a slide, individually then open it on my phone and screenshot it in present mode because my computer says ‚Äúno‚Äù to drive share
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:53:42 It‚Äôs up
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:56:10 What do you guys think?
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:58:12 XD
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:03:00 You are all very welcome lmao
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:07:25 Well you see, I kinda created the universe
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 23:10:43 Finally made a vtol woohoo
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:12:34 Hundred
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:15:52 I will break the cycle, although I admit we could go on for uncountable hours
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:19:10 Ten Billion
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 23:20:45 Have any feedback
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 23:20:58 In the creations channel is where it is
creations-chat 2021-02-22 23:55:54 So how does it everyone like my vtol?
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:10:07 So, how could I improve
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:13:56 And don‚Äôt just reply with an opposite message, be specific (planned to send before)
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:19:16 So 1: I like winter camo, it‚Äôs winter. I much like the colour scheme of highlighted seats and amber glass. Do you mean greens? Panzer style browns yellows and greens? Don‚Äôt just tell me my Colors are bad. Be more specific and give me an example.
2: Understandable, my next design will probably have them hidden in the hull in between blocks, good point.
3: The whole reason it‚Äôs shape is weird is because it‚Äôs mine, that‚Äôs not really a criticism and more of an unnecessary callout, have you seen some of the plane designs Germans came up with, hell even the b2 is ‚Äúweird‚Äù. It‚Äôs a fictional aircraft, so sorry.
4: Most vtols have wings, the osprey has forms of elevators, including literally every vtol jet. So do helicopters which have slight roll control with those side thingies. And it‚Äôs not supposed to be futuristic in that sense, and any futuristic aircraft would still need control surfaces to fly in the atmosphere.
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:21:26 Still there?
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:25:08 Cute
creations-chat 2021-02-23 00:27:17 I apologize if that came on strong but I am looking for criticism so I can improve future builds, that is why I‚Äôm here. So anything else I could improve on (and how)
creations-chat 2021-02-23 12:50:49 Sps is studs per second right?
creations-chat 2021-02-23 18:52:26 I‚Äôm going to work on the Humingbird MK2. I will be hiding the props if need be and will be giving it much more detail on the interior, and some basic detail on the outside. Is there anything you would like to add? Scroll back to yesterday to find my vtol in the creations channel if you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about XD
creations-chat 2021-02-23 18:54:36 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/813544020512604222
This is the message
creations-chat 2021-02-23 19:01:08 Does anyone mind giving me some advice?
creations-chat 2021-02-23 19:06:42 Will do, the next design will hide them in the hull
creations-chat 2021-02-23 19:08:44 Also for camo, maybe some greens? Which camos do you guys like, and if you have photos please send!
general 2021-02-23 19:12:07 No questions asked, best looking camo on a plane. Show
general 2021-02-23 19:21:04 We can post non nsfw images here right?
general 2021-02-23 19:22:22 Oh wait I do
general 2021-02-23 19:22:52 Well I‚Äôm just going to go ahead and post two camo types,
general 2021-02-23 19:22:55 If that‚Äôs ok
general 2021-02-23 19:23:15 Three oops, which one do you all prefer
general 2021-02-23 19:24:13 I honestly like the Belgium pattern, and to make it less laggy I‚Äôm minimizing block count
general 2021-02-23 19:24:17 But yeah I see why
general 2021-02-23 19:25:57 Since Flecktarn is land based I think il go fleck
general 2021-02-23 19:27:29 If it‚Äôs a troop carrier would it generally be army owned?
creations-chat 2021-02-23 22:44:25 Progress is going great. The Mk2 Hummingbird has 32 seats and a back that folds open almost seamlessly. 
I‚Äôm very proud because I am adding as much detail as possible. It even has a little cargo bay n stuff
Il send more photos soon
creations-chat 2021-02-23 23:04:16 I‚Äôm going to try to use a different method, but the slides system is the best I have currently. For some reason I can‚Äôt import my photos to my iPhone so, eh
creations-chat 2021-02-23 23:09:44 Do you guys think flektarn is a good pick? I have think I might use it
creations-chat 2021-02-24 02:12:12 More news:
The vtol is coming along good, engines and body all complete. 
The only thing I don‚Äôt know how to work around is takeoff and landing; I still have to use props. But I will hide them in the hull.
I can‚Äôt use motor two mouse controls because, they freak out and the elevators don‚Äôt do much at very low speeds. Rip.
An I want it stable in both vtol and conventional flight so that‚Äôs why configuring the ballasts just makes it nose heavy
general 2021-02-24 02:28:04 Knocked a 2 meter icicle off of my window and might have broke a shingle or two.
general 2021-02-24 02:28:07 Oops
general 2021-02-24 02:28:55 It was hanging in front of my window
general 2021-02-24 02:29:00 Should have taken a picture
general 2021-02-24 02:29:57 Is anyone still accepting map suggestions?
general 2021-02-24 02:30:02 For the new map
general 2021-02-24 02:30:37 Because I love cartography and would love to make a concept,
general 2021-02-24 02:30:46 Based off of the ones already made of course
general 2021-02-24 02:30:52 As I‚Äôm not the first to do so
general 2021-02-24 02:34:56 Uh
general 2021-02-24 02:35:16 Is that a joke, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs aloud m8
general 2021-02-24 02:35:34 Did you read the rules?
general 2021-02-24 02:36:01 Oh. Still not loggers
general 2021-02-24 02:36:05 Poggers*
general 2021-02-24 02:36:21 Yup
general 2021-02-24 02:36:28 Hey guys,
general 2021-02-24 02:36:40 Who would I contact if I wanted to make a game map
general 2021-02-24 02:36:58 Any artists or,
general 2021-02-24 02:42:39 Would it be illegal to make my own map
general 2021-02-24 02:42:55 And or post it in creations
creations-chat 2021-02-24 14:48:39 Vtol is done, I just need to conceal the props and paint
creations-chat 2021-02-24 14:52:40 I spelt it vtol? gotcha
creations-chat 2021-02-24 14:56:19 Well anyway. Flecktarn look good to you guys? I
creations-chat 2021-02-24 14:59:24 You are correct, and to awnser Nephus, it‚Äôs the paint job I‚Äôm giving my aircraft
creations-chat 2021-02-24 15:23:03 One sec let me check
creations-chat 2021-02-24 15:25:21 Yes the rear elevator looks a bit long, length of the plane wise. There‚Äôs not much you can do since I only think it‚Äôs three or two blocks wide but, the elevator is thick in my opinion. And this is not a design flaw, but standard greys don‚Äôt do it for me with many aircraft.
But it‚Äôs an all round original nice looking build
creations-chat 2021-02-24 16:24:40 It‚Äôs done
creations-chat 2021-02-24 16:26:54 Sneak peak, Colors aren‚Äôt even picking up because of how bad phone to screen quality is.
general 2021-02-24 16:27:19 Woohoo done the Hummingbird II
creations-chat 2021-02-24 16:30:27 I‚Äôm taking the higher quality in a sec
creations-chat 2021-02-24 16:37:48 Oops, and ^
general 2021-02-24 23:35:37 Could I post a picture of my cat yawning as I pet it
general 2021-02-24 23:36:13 
general 2021-02-24 23:36:25 Yawn
general 2021-02-24 23:38:01 Hey so also
general 2021-02-24 23:39:30 Cat melts-into-slush-on-blue-heating-pad.mp4
general 2021-02-24 23:40:00 Mans she likes the pad more than my hands and I‚Äôm sad. Because she is addicted to it
general 2021-02-24 23:40:37 She doesn‚Äôt even have the power to fully meow when she‚Äôs lying down on it, she kinda just goes
*mouth open silence*
general 2021-02-24 23:41:33 Tastes lean
general 2021-02-24 23:41:47 Nice and 
**TENDER**
general 2021-02-24 23:42:27 Nah m‚Äôy cat doesn‚Äôt know how to be unhealthy. She is like 18 and still runs around, jumps up on things and meows like crazy
general 2021-02-24 23:42:45 Suprisingly active
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:44:56 I‚Äôm very angry, after a solid 4 hours of work on my vtol the images won‚Äôt copy and paste into a slide
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:44:58 :((((((
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:45:34 So weird
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:45:53 It‚Äôs not, just the images I took of it won‚Äôt paste
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:45:55 Idk why
creations-chat 2021-02-25 19:25:54 For whatever the reason, can‚Äôt post the images. Il try again rn. Very frustrating because I‚Äôm proud of it, will be making more this time motorlocked vtols
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:51:00 Created a smaller vtol Il check
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:53:27 I actually like the camo, reminds me of fruitcake, supposed to be kinda like Belgian camo or Flecktarn,
(I‚Äôm looking for parts)
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:55:34 906 Parts, also blobfish. Elaborate, I would like to improve.
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:58:06 Again, not trying to be critical here, but what do you mean by shape. I almost tried to go for a thicker helicopter body and then swept I guess b2 style wings. It‚Äôs the design the most stable IMO, so could you give me some examples? It‚Äôs ok if you can‚Äôt
(Also I can fix the props by lowering them one block, that‚Äôs 100% me being lazy)
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:02:16 I tried to combat that by motor locking the wings into the actual craft, I‚Äôm not too sure how to improve that. I guess I could round the bottom out a bit too
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:05:20 So you guys think I should bring the vertical stabilizers center build on the edges of the elevators?
If I hid some props too that would probably make turning while hovering way easier
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:08:46 ** E G G G **
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:10:48 So anything else you guys would like fixed with the Dragonfly RDEA?
general 2021-02-26 02:12:16 If anyone has the time could someone give a review of my recent post is <#384025409945337856>
I want to make improved versions n stuff.
Which camos would work, design tips.
More suited for the <#384021699466756107> channel but idc
general 2021-02-26 02:13:28 Lmaooooo
plane-crazy 2021-02-26 02:14:29 Anyone have the time to give a little feedback?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:16:52 Anything else?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:22:36 If you haven‚Äôt already add slight rgb variation, keep it under a difference of 10. It adds a more detailed, depth look I think.
(Makes sense)
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:28:25 any feedback for me?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:30:32 Correct, I‚Äôm still looking for feedback. That‚Äôs why tomorrow im building a new one, I‚Äôm about to sleep rn lmao
help 2021-02-26 02:34:05 I don‚Äôt have any images but was wondering how you go about getting trails and stuff to work as metal wire on cockpits, fine and angled motor lock detail n stuff, and I think it‚Äôs related to camera lock.
Anyone mind if explaining the basics or handing me a tutorial please?
help 2021-02-26 03:23:07 Anyone
help 2021-02-26 03:24:59 Modular weapons should be added
help 2021-02-26 03:25:21 So, you have like bomb front, bomb back. Add any size or length of payload in between
help 2021-02-26 03:25:32 Adjust barrel caliber and size,
help 2021-02-26 03:25:55 Fire rate and then maybe even muzzle velocity and stuff like that
help 2021-02-26 03:26:30 And maybe something like: after sustained fire 20 seconds reload for 10, and you can fire for longer depending on how much ammo is in your plane
general 2021-02-26 03:34:36 How do I go about making a suggestion

general 2021-02-26 03:42:36 Well I‚Äôm to tired to figure it out: add a building block for air, in the sense that you could: select the inside of a build and everything in that area isn‚Äôt effected by the outside. Mainly for when you get up at above 200 sps and then get ejected
general 2021-02-26 03:42:42 Is that even possible?
general 2021-02-26 03:43:25 Maybe
general 2021-02-26 03:43:42 [yesno]
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 03:32:45 I think I might try to build a v280 valve

creations-chat 2021-02-27 03:35:11 Contrary to popular opinion, spread out evenly across a build I think some exposed motor lock gives a mechanical look. I don‚Äôt hate it
creations-chat 2021-02-27 03:38:18 When I say spread out I mean, usually in smaller builds if there‚Äôs lots it almost evens out, but if you make a big build with only one or two random or exposed spots it looks horrible,
creations-chat 2021-02-27 03:44:50 üòÆ
I‚Äôm poor
help 2021-02-27 03:46:51 If I were to make a motor locked creation and also attempt to camera lock, If I attempted to attach the turning camera parts to one of the motor Lock levels it would work, because it‚Äôs welded to the main seat correct?
creations-chat 2021-02-27 03:48:52 Going to attempt to make a bell V280 ‚ÄúValor‚Äù, any tutorials, tips to watch before hand. I will be watching one for sliding doors and I‚Äôm going to test more with cameras but think I‚Äôm ready
creations-chat 2021-02-27 16:25:42 Because the v280 valor is in development I can make alterations to the design, woohoo
(I‚Äôm talking armament, not the shape or anything)
creations-chat 2021-02-27 17:04:42 And I give up
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 22:53:24 I had the idea to make a massive vtol ww1 style (blimb looking) with a backdoor that opens up and reveals an interior runway
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 22:53:31 I could do it, but my computer could not
general 2021-02-28 05:04:51 
general 2021-02-28 05:05:09 Didn‚Äôt even remove the credit
general 2021-02-28 05:05:14 Because I‚Äôm a chad
general 2021-02-28 05:05:54 *debfs*
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:07:12 Since people are kinda talking bout it
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:07:30 If I wanted to submit a map how would I, and do they even take anymore suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:08:25 I think it looks good, only thing I would change is making the white section a block or two shorter in width
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:13:15 Coolio
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:14:43 I made a tilt rotor helicopter (kinda like a v280) but the rotors look ugly
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:14:59 They are covered in little prop engines for thrust
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:15:08 Because rockets make it hella unstable
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:15:15 Anything else I could try?
general 2021-02-28 05:18:12 
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 05:18:37 Looks good
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 13:59:54 I‚Äôm in school rn but later today i can post pictures of my most motorlocked build, I build a tilt rotor helicopter, like the osprey or the valor, but it‚Äôs an attack variant and has no carry space
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 14:00:37 And it was super stressful but I think I have a decent throttled rotors
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 14:01:45 I think you need to get to level three for image permissions
plane-crazy 2021-03-01 14:02:09 Shouldn‚Äôt take you too long XD

general 2021-03-03 02:34:56 I‚Äôm about to build something controversial
general 2021-03-03 02:35:18 *A motorlocked shredder, built for design; not combat*
general 2021-03-03 02:36:19 Lmao I guess
general 2021-03-03 02:36:27 Man, another lag machine
general 2021-03-03 02:37:04 I just got into an argument with a guy saying I was trash while using a tnt box against a shredder. Say what you will, neither of us had the right to speak
general 2021-03-03 02:37:17 He was the shredder,
general 2021-03-03 02:40:55 What does it mean pvp is fixed
general 2021-03-04 23:26:41 I don‚Äôt know if anyone is interested, even though there is already one on the wiki, I want to make a classification system and guide for builds in plane crazy
general 2021-03-04 23:27:00 Like, an identification booklet that helps you strategize for pvp
general 2021-03-04 23:27:32 There already is one; and I don‚Äôt feel like editing it

general 2021-03-05 00:18:24 DERT Detail, Era, Role, Type
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:33:01 Making a classification system for all the wild creations in plane crazy, here is the first part. What do you guys think?
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:33:07 
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:35:40 I‚Äôm making a document where il (document haha funny) all of the types of builds in plane crazy. And get a general consensus from others on what the best ways to combat them are
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:35:50 And a rundown of how the creation works, the insides
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:40:09 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:40:15 Nah, got any feedback
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:40:24 Any other ways you could classify builds?
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:41:07 I was thinking about adding a section about the pilot
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:41:30 Where it talks about skills that are important, some important modules for builds (like motor lock) and general skill
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:49:17 Yknow what I haven‚Äôt seen anyone build
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:49:33 Panavia Tornado IDS

plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:50:10 This bad boy
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:50:26 Probably one of my favourite jets
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:51:41 Maybe but it‚Äôs one of the first jets I saw
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:51:49 And it‚Äôs called the Panavia Tornado
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:52:02 Cold War era used up until the mid 80s I think
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:52:53 It‚Äôs a modern boom and zoom fighter
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:53:12 Flew low in the mountains and would release all of its payload at once on one or multiple targets
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:53:32 What do you mean why?
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:54:01 Man. Sus means nothing

plane-crazy 2021-03-05 00:56:05 So, yes

general 2021-03-17 23:59:45 Ok let me get past tags
general 2021-03-18 00:00:09 The thing doesn‚Äôt even have the stuff, and I‚Äôm obviously not gonna post hand holding before marriage, so where is the rule on it

general 2021-03-18 00:07:05 But while the chat is calm,
general 2021-03-18 00:07:27 Is there a rule for suggestive stuff, because I didn‚Äôt mean to get the hips in that. Just wanted to show the abs, so that‚Äôs my bad
general 2021-03-18 00:07:46 It had no parts
general 2021-03-18 00:07:53 Also yeah, why am I not warned?

general 2021-03-18 00:18:54 Wait so hold on, just having that there is inappropriate?
general 2021-03-18 00:19:31 Well I think of suggestive content as if say, someone holding them and making a certain face

general 2021-03-18 00:21:23 Not that you would care, but I want to make sure I know the rules well so that I don‚Äôt get banned
general 2021-03-18 00:21:31 Not you,
general 2021-03-18 00:21:50 I‚Äôm just trying to get some specifics here and some reasoning, nothing more and nothing less
general 2021-03-18 00:22:24 And again, that‚Äôs the first anatomy practice I‚Äôve done, ever. I draw planets and maps most of the time
general 2021-03-18 00:22:38 Have you not read anything in the last 5 minutes when I talked about art,
general 2021-03-18 00:22:51 Ok listen, I‚Äôm sorry if I come off as passive aggressive
general 2021-03-18 00:22:57 One sec
general 2021-03-18 00:23:08 Can‚Äôt draw guns smh, but you can
general 2021-03-18 00:23:15 Yes I like the green agog
general 2021-03-18 00:23:18 Acog*
general 2021-03-18 00:23:22 Gives it a nice flare
general 2021-03-18 00:24:32 So, I‚Äôm wondering why I got warned. No clothing stuff is understandable, especially if it‚Äôs a humanoid with, parts. 
But I‚Äôm just wondering what the def of suggestive is, because I feel that someone just walking around (if they don‚Äôt have that) wouldn‚Äôt be suggestive. If they were posing or talking provacitavely, that‚Äôs a different story
general 2021-03-18 00:24:37 Does that make sense?
general 2021-03-18 00:25:11 I already asked the guy who was here a lil while ago
general 2021-03-18 00:26:06 Well anyways
general 2021-03-18 00:26:11 Il stop
general 2021-03-18 00:26:27 In short, but confused on how the word suggestive is being used but it‚Äôs just me.
general 2021-03-18 13:22:49 Wow
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 15:22:22 I decided to start work on an npp (nuclear power plant) and instead of making the rooms then filling them in I have a whole pipe system and did a bunch of research so it‚Äôs realistic XD
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 15:22:36 Everything has to be condensed though, unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 15:25:05 Any tips for making it look nice and polished?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:39:59 Well the power plant looks crappy, and it‚Äôs Chernobyl style anyways. So il make a modern one
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:42:10 What
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:42:19 So, lighter than ice?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:42:57 Well with ice you can build huge creations, use like 4 rocket engines and go up to 800 speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:43:18 I use ice to make cubes when people are annoying me or destroying my builds
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:43:22 I think ice is the lightest
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:43:56 Make a chart, fill your plot with a layer of the material and see how many engines it takes to move it
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:44:24 True
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:44:39 Unrelated but does anyone know the plot width and length
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:44:53 Ok thank you
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:45:13 I‚Äôm gonna plan out my power plant properly this time
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:45:27 With containment buildings and everything
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:47:14 Oh XD
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:48:25 Does anyone have some simple building tips?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:48:28 Ooooh also
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:48:36 Anyone have that computer emojis link
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:48:55 Please send, I need to make my control room loook n I c e
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 13:48:57 Ok thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:00:01 It looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:00:02 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:00:20 Cockpit seems a bit tall, I finely wrapped had quarter blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:00:26 But that‚Äôs just my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:02:04 How many reactors should I do
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:02:22 I‚Äôm doing a modern power plant
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:02:32 Two reactors per containment building (a dome)
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:02:38 Why; because I feel like it
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:02:46 And reactor meltdowns are fun to rp with
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:03:48 Company blueprints
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:05:16 Yeah I‚Äôm making a blueprint for my power plant
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:07:37 So how many containment building should I do
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:07:44 If two reactors are for each done
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:07:48 Dome*
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:07:55 Yup all par for the course
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:09:23 So if we have two turbines, a backup just in case
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:09:36 It would make sense to have atleast two reactors, so I think il double it
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:10:02 Does a turbine building with 2 turbines, 2 containment domes with 2 reactors each and then 1 cooling tower sound good
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:10:05 Sounds like a lot XD
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:25:36 That‚Äôs smart
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:25:46 I wish blacklisting actually did stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:26:20 Like I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs said that they can‚Äôt do it but, just make it so that people who are blacklisted don‚Äôt do Anya damage, and go through your build
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:26:46 I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I just want to have a fight with some friends and a stupid missile user kamikazes us
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:26:51 YES
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:27:09 So automatically, if someone blacklists you, you blacklist them
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:27:23 That‚Äôs a suggestion we need
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:27:35 Are they still taking map suggestions?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:27:47 Damn
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:29:59 Ez
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:29:59 Oh il just do a fusion reactor
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:29:59 Should I just make a standard nuclear plant or make one of those black matter reactor thingies
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:36:10 I guess I‚Äôm making an mcr
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:36:17 Magnetic confinement reactor
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:36:21 *so cool*
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:40:46 That‚Äôs the one with the spiny spiny loop magnets

Rick?
general 2021-03-29 14:45:57 It‚Äôs like that
general 2021-03-29 14:47:25 Rick, do you think a fusion reactor is worth it?
general 2021-03-29 14:49:35 Is there a way to move the building cursor on mobile?
general 2021-03-29 14:50:02 Because it‚Äôs in such an awkward position on my screen when I play on my phone, would it be possible to manipulate it and drag I around the screen?
general 2021-03-29 14:50:29 Alright makes sense
general 2021-03-29 14:51:49 Just use textures, I guarantee a large build, if you change the materials to diamond plate or fabric, will lag crazily
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:52:58 Yeah that‚Äôs true
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:54:09 Will anyone want to work at a fusion reactor power plant, actually hold up we need a name
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:54:21 It‚Äôs gonna have mcr in the name, for magnetic confinement reactor
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:55:08 Not the chaos
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:55:11 The lag
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:55:42 20 players with like, block counts within 1500-3000 with textures
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:55:50 My pc would beg for the bullet at that point
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 14:57:09 Please no

plane-crazy 2021-03-29 15:31:33 Time to get to work on the power plant
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 15:32:54 Do you think that wish me luck is a selfish statement?
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 15:33:52 When someone says ‚Äúwish me luck‚Äù

general 2021-04-10 19:07:36 You can‚Äôt use helium for helies right, the rank atleast
general 2021-04-10 19:08:41 Oh no I just use it for balancing, although ballasts serve the same purpose
general 2021-04-10 19:09:15 I might post pictures later of a heli I made, big old MI-6 looking thing with an opening back and rope hhhhh
general 2021-04-10 19:09:17 Took hours
general 2021-04-10 19:09:47 Are ballasts easier to configure?
general 2021-04-10 19:10:05 I guess instead of removing blocks you just change values
general 2021-04-10 19:10:18 And I guess you can get it literally perfect for hovering
general 2021-04-10 19:10:36 I use it sometimes
general 2021-04-10 19:11:46 Ooh here‚Äôs a suggestion, every part has paint block configuration. Like, you can color each side differently
general 2021-04-10 19:12:45 Wait, is unde slang for underage
general 2021-04-10 19:12:59 Yup
general 2021-04-10 19:13:41 I mean, they used generate instead of make and thrust instead of power

general 2021-04-12 13:47:16 Spilt water over what I think was the fan of my pc last night, unplugged everything and turned it off immideately, dried it off with a towel yada yada. Hours later I turn it back on and it makes a popping noise every once in a while
general 2021-04-12 13:47:35 And this morning it wouldn‚Äôt turn on, although I think that‚Äôs cuz its battery ran out of juice naturally
general 2021-04-12 13:48:10 When I turned it on yesterday it‚Äôs internet worked, download speed was good and it‚Äôs battery didn‚Äôt seem damaged

plane-crazy 2021-04-12 13:56:00 While it‚Äôs not very good for pvp I made a huge Heli that has a drop rope and openable back
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 13:56:03 Very proud of it
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:35:37 I have a question
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:35:50 If you put 10 guns in a line they only do the damage of one gun right?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:36:00 Does it actually multiply power?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:36:13 Ok, it seems and feels way more effective to separate then
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:36:17 Them*
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:36:25 Larger area of effect I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:36:37 Yes but does the damage stack
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:37:08 Reasonable
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 17:37:18 Fastest jet I made was 430 lol

*its not a furry if it‚Äôs a fantasy world**
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:15:49 Yes that is a leech
general 2021-06-15 21:17:11 <@!746383586755870821> I accidentally reposted your meme forgive me
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:20:52 I mean, honestly I would take that monkey over her
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:20:57 Lore time:
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:21:10 She‚Äôs like a fallen angel who got eaten by leeches when she fell into a swamp
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:21:17 So, she has a bunch attached to her
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:21:21 Including her hair
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:22:26 Well, they‚Äôve attached themselves to her spine or scalp
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:22:34 Her tongue is basically a leech
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:22:36 Kinda
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:22:48 Well, leeches have two mouths
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:23:06 One of them has teeth (the one for feeding) the other end is a suction cup
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:23:33 So in that way, her tail is like a thing she can hang off of stuff and then she sucks blood or whatever with her mouth
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:23:51 It‚Äôs a symbiote, no pain, but yeah
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:09 That‚Äôs why she eats real food and blood, feed herself and the leeches
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:18 No, because there are no mouth parts
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:29 Think of it like the leeches mouths are the parts attached to her
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:36 Alright so
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:39 Il explain again
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:49 The standard leech has two mouth parts
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:24:53 One on each end
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:00 Only *one* of them has a mouth
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:05 The other is a suction cup
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:15 The part with the actual mouth is attached to her flesh
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:28 Therefore all of the ‚Äúleeches‚Äù on her body are just the end bits
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:39 The blood coursing through her body is what feeds the leeches
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:49 Which is why she needs to drink it,
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:25:55 Make sense at all?
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:26:28 Again, symbiote
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:26:41 If they kill her and they are attached to her permenantly they just die with her
the-dump 2021-06-15 21:27:13 Again, fantasy world. If an angel can fall from the heavens who says leeches are still dumb

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:28:36 Lemme get a better photo
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:29:10 Isn‚Äôt that considerably toned?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:29:24 Looks darker irl
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:29:27 If that makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 21:52:31 Man I love plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 21:52:56 The only game I can self destruct a space station with not nearly enough escape pods and save only one of my friends
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 21:53:05 :‚Äô)
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 21:53:07 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 21:53:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:06 Okay I love this game x2
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:11 Thank you so much rick
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:38 Last night I made a research space station (with not nearly enough escape pods) and we were attacked by jets n stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:44 So we had to eject
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:49 And the station blew up
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:34:54 It was so fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:01 NOOOOOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:22 It was at like 2:00am, it was quiet. There was some music going
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:26 It was really nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:29 Despite the chaos lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:42 **bopping**
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:51 So much nostalgia tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:55 It was just so fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:36:05 Damn
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:36:14 I saw two cutter balls have a cringe battle yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:36:50 Then <@!698911110773866576> (Gape Senpai in game I think) got out his cube and annihilated them
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:36:57 Which btw, thanks Gabe
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:14 XD
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:27 And I remember the anchor block got hit and the station started tumbling XD
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:36 We had to eject it was so cool lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:42:05 Research station
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:42:25 It was made up of a central hall, along the hall you had a storage room and observatory
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:42:30 The ‚Äúeye‚Äù is what we called it
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:42:53 Then on the right of it we had the claw (for docking), a service railing and the crew cabin
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:43:37 Then on the right we had an airlock and a railing that went far out for the escape rack (where the pods are)
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:43:56 It was basically a wall with disconnecters and the three pods ready to be disconnected
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:44:11 There was also a control room and laboratory along the length of it
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:44:19 Il send a photo later
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:59:22 I have it saved yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:59:29 My name is the same in game
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:59:35 Il ne playing later today
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:01:37 XD
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:01:48 I made a machine called the sender specifically designed for that purpose
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:02:07 The premise is that there is a capsule or chair, the capsule is on top of an anchored motor at max speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:02:23 There is a ring with ropes attached to the capsule on all sides
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:02:27 So here‚Äôs how it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:02:44 First the ropes are loosened, loosentend enough that spinning the craft doesn‚Äôt affect
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:03:05 Il ne db Cooper hell yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:04:14 Anyways you start spinning
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:04:17 Then tighten the ropes
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:04:36 And the combination of plane crazy dark magic makes the craft go flying
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:04:43 And it even breaks the anchor lol

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:53:20 Quick, paint scheme
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:53:31 Redoing my super hind and I am at a loss for camo
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:53:41 Trying to keep simplistic, under 3 colors
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:54:01 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:54:03 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:50:46 Contact effectiveness of a helicopter with its rotor on its belly
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:50:51 Allow me to elaborate
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:51:01 The pylons could ‚Äúcover‚Äù it a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:51:10 Landing gear just has to be outside the radius
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:51:34 Realistically maybe works (maybe even better since the rotor is pushing the craft, not pulling against gravity)
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 07:52:25 And the body of the helicopter serves as a shield for its most important part?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:00:55 Im asking if it would effective at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:00:59 Irl and in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 08:01:04 Sorry if that wasn‚Äôt too clear
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:28:43 Some questions I have about jets if y‚Äôall make them often
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:28:51 Can you do a combo of mouse control and wasd?*
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:29:00 If so how
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:29:10 And what speed should a good fighter generally travel at
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:29:14 Or be able to travel at*
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:29:18 (Air to air)
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:41:40 I‚Äôm assuming the way you do it is custom control surfaces, and then on the edges the mouse control ones?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:41:57 I tried doing it once but had way more mouse control than wasd and hard turns we‚Äôre very hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:42:10 And I only want mouse control for aim and slight adjustments
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:42:22 So I‚Äôm assuming you need more wasd than cursor controls
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:11 What speeds do your planes fly at?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:14 Jets i mean?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:33 Sick
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:38 I can‚Äôt beat that
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:40 That‚Äôs godly
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:12:40 Realistically tho?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:12:47 Like, a reasonable jet fighter speed?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:13:37 Wow
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:13:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:15 At what point is speed not necessary
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:31 Since you won‚Äôt be dogfighting shredder bugs at 5000 spa
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:33 Sps*
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:17:21 Fair
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:17:41 I‚Äôm going to make a multi role fighter so I think il shoot for a cruising speed of around 600
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:17:53 And then an afterburner that goes closer to 1200
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:17:55 Hopefully
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:05 (Using hover drives)
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:11 As I think they are the most stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:26 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:30 No I mean hovers
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:43 Have you heard of a hover drive?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:55 Ah sick
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:12 Which is the best drive do you think?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:23 Maybe I make the afterburner a magnet drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:30 Since the ‚Äúloose parts‚Äù on motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:32 Like the ailerons
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:38 And it isn‚Äôt too laggy for short bursts
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:20:57 Makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:11 I think il use a hover drive for main power
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:22 And motorlock some engines for nice design
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:28 Although they are really just aesthetic
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:48 And since motor attached parts are counted as loose (I think) then I could use a magnet drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:53 For afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:13:45 I‚Äôm so mad at myself
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:13:52 Just figured out how to do proper dual control
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:13:54 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:14:10 The smoothest way is to set yaw and pitch to mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:14:19 And then roll with a and d
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:14:29 To correct your angle of approach
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:14:52 Man this is gonna be fun tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:16:03 What scale do y‚Äôall make jets at?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:16:11 Or planes for that matter
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:17:13 Don‚Äôt you hate it when you get blacklossed by a shroider noob?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:17:25 -Words spoken by unnamed individual
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:17:34 Blacklossed
the-dump 2021-08-15 04:17:52 Now that‚Äôs plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:41:48 I will be taking some friends up in a helium craft as high as I can, I will take photos. And document the stages of deformation our characters experience
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:42:10 Our goal is to discover (if) the hieght when physics stop working
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:42:14 Oh my
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:42:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:42:40 Short
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:51:28 When physics stop as in the blocks separate n stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:51:45 Maybe if there‚Äôs a point when like, anchor blocks for example separate from the craft
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:51:55 Fair
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:52:05 So it‚Äôs just the display that gets messed up yes?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:52:10 Including the chat bars
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:52:33 Does it have something to do with getting a certain point away from the spawn, I‚Äôve observed it in phantom forces and babtft too
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:52:46 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:52:59 Il just 0g a craft that‚Äôs a giant cube filled with helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:53:11 Il make it a couple blocks thick so we don‚Äôt fall through the floor
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:53:22 I only play on 8 graphics
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:53:24 I wouldn‚Äôt know
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:53:25 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 12:53:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:18:41 Mind elaborating?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:19:00 Is it the same thing that happens in minecraft with the farlands?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:19:11 How generation gets less and less accurate the further away from spawn?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:19:31 Gotcha gotcha gotcha
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:19:33 Makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:20:30 Oh my
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:20:46 Ah yeah, so it‚Äôs not a plane crazy or build a boat thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:20:53 Has to do with roblox gen
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:20:59 Fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:21:02 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:21:36 I‚Äôm building an avro arrow type fighter bomber rn, il get back to y‚Äôall in a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:30:13 Alright I‚Äôm back
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:30:54 Man I wish the plane crazy map was so much bigger, one of my fastest jets (admittedly it‚Äôs a fighter bomber, not built for agility) only travels at 580, and I feel like I‚Äôm going hypersonic
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:31:34 And with lag influencing how stability works, atleast in my case, it‚Äôs so hard to efficiently and stability get past 900 with big builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:31:39 Woohoo!!
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:31:54 I was trying to figure out how to send in a map lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:32:02 Since I like map making and felt like making one
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:32:51 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:32:53 So sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:32:54 F
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:33:22 Damn
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:33:23 That‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:33:25 Effective
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:34:10 Since my fighter bomber is low altitude I was wondering if maybe I should add a speaker with a sonic boom sound
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:07 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:24 The expedition to the beyond has commenced
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:26 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:08:53 Travelling at 10000 speed after 3 minutes this is the deformation
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:09:14 You cannot walk up along wedges, or stairs, even travelling across blocks is difficult
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:09:22 I fear that I might fall through the ground soon
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:09:47 Oh my
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:10:00 No idea lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:10:02 Less lag?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:10:26 Okay after unanchoring we are back at the 10000 speed checkpoint.
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:11:33 Generation through glass is funky already
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:11:55 The craft is visibly beginning to separate
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:11:58 Oh god
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:13:23 Pardon?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:13:31 Ohhhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:13:36 The rickroll yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:14:21 17 for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:14:49 When should the next speed checkpoint be? I‚Äôm at 13000 rn, and the craft is visibly broken
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:15:19 Since I‚Äôm wayyyyyyy past the altitude level I‚Äôm using speed as anchor checkpoints
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:15:24 To check on the distortion
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:15:27 Chair
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:15:37 Don‚Äôt mind if I do
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:15:58 Rick if you don‚Äôt mind me asking when did you add the update again? I‚Äôve been playing for a while now
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:16:50 I need to rejoin then lololol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:17:11 Is 22700 speed fast enough?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:17:28 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:17:29 Stopping
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:18:07 Oh my

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:18:35 Roblox moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:29 Should I jump?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:29 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:42 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:44 Here we go
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:50 And il do 999 grab
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:53 Grav*
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:23:24 Well
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:23:50 A conclusion to the null point experiment
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:23:55 ANooooooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:00 Well anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:07 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:20 Of course it crashed
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:26 I topped out at 13000 speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:27 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:28:08 I uploaded the minute long experience to YouTube
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:28:16 Il send the link in one sec if that‚Äôs alright

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:30:16 Wwaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:30:28 NOOOOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:31:10 So naturally I‚Äôm going to quad the amount of helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:31:39 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:31:46 Enjoy screen dirt
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:32:05 My crusty pc probably can‚Äôt run it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:32:07 Literally
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:33:29 2011, maybe has a graphics card, can maybe work unpowered for 1:40, shuts off when I press too hard in one spot, broken antenna needs a direct connect cord
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:33:37 Tldr It‚Äôs on life support
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:33:54 I don‚Äôt know much beyond that lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:33:57 It‚Äôs dell made,
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:34:03 Don‚Äôt know the model
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:34:57 That pipe at water has always been there yeah?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:36:18 At 10000
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:36:22 I don‚Äôt see anything up here
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:37:01 Where have we checked so far?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:37:17 For the Easter egg I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:37:44 The smooth
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:39:20 Where the hell is that lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:39:36 Searching under the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:41:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:41:52 I‚Äôve searched at the 10000 mark and a little sweep under the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:41:55 Idk where it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:42:22 Well how are we gonna check that
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:42:41 Doing that
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:44:05 I‚Äôm doing that currently
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:44:08 About halfway done
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:44:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:44:49 I‚Äôm an idiot
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:44:54 You can see under lava with glass
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:46:22 I‚Äôve done a full sweep of the lava lakes and rivers
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:46:24 Nothing
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:46:49 Nothing under the map I don‚Äôt think
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:46:53 It might be underwater
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:46:55 No clue
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:47:13 Il check water again
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:49:02 I think I see a small hole under the dock
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:49:06 I‚Äôm investigating
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:50:24 Sending pic
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:50:27 Going in
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:50:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:51:01 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:51:09 Generation glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:52:16 Who‚Äôs talking about what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:52:41 Shoot
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:00 WAIT WHERE
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:15 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:21 I‚Äôm going to take my cube
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:28 Il go in all 4 cardinal directions
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:49 Il go south from spawn first
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:53:55 (Cube because cube fast)
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:54:10 You go behind, il go infront
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:55:30 I can almost not see spawn anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:56:02 Just use rope, a beam of helium and a dream
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:56:18 Or a main pilot seat and gravity slider lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:09 I‚Äôve gone far enough the map hasn‚Äôt been generating
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:23 I think after travelling a couple minutes it‚Äôs safe to assume there is nothing ahead
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:30 We need to check behind first tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:46 I‚Äôm going behind rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:53 I‚Äôm going to search all four
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:57:55 Just in case
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:58:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:58:48 I‚Äôve searched slate, the ocean, all the lava pits, under the map and way above
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:58:50 Nothing
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:59:09 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:59:51 I think you‚Äôre right
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:59:54 I don‚Äôt see anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:00:33 I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre talking about
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:01:18 I‚Äôve done one to all 4
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:01:53 Far enough that the map gets about the length of a couple dozen pixels
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:02:01 I think it would have loaded in if it was a full map
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:02:05 Even far away
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:02:11 I‚Äôm positive there is nothing out there
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:02:19 That‚Äôs smart
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:06:44 I give up lol il
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:40 What‚Äôs that
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:43 You find it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:21:02 He added one a couple hours ago
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:21:10 Where do you find that
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:21:25 Gotcha
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 21:09:09 Proportionally what is the biggest biome in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 21:09:16 I‚Äôm assuming the grassland?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 21:09:43 I‚Äôm going to give myself robloxia disruption camo, and try to hide in the grass lol
general 2021-08-18 22:48:21 I tried to join plane crazy and got teleported to Bitcoin mining simulator?
general 2021-08-18 22:48:52 Ah yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:04:04 For those of you who have experience in building helicopters (specifically single or coaxial rotor helicopters) I need help counteracting titling when I‚Äôm forward flight. 
I build two types of helies most often. Either a motor-driven coaxial set up (using wing panels, propellor blades for ‚Äústatic‚Äù lift and  control surfaces for ‚Äúcontrolled lift‚Äù. Alternatively, usually for much bigger helicopters, use thrust power, and only one rotor (again using propellor blades for static lift).
When I‚Äôm forward flight, by using hidden rocket engines, the helicopters always tilt to one side. With the single rotor set up I expected this but even with the coaxial rotor set up it happens. This tilting only happens when moving forward, it isn‚Äôt noticeable when hovering.
If you don‚Äôt know what this is or what I‚Äôm talking about that‚Äôs alright but if you do please help, I‚Äôm stuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:04:26 Sorry it‚Äôs a bit long lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:05:10 Problem solved people
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:05:11 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:05:34 Elaborate
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:05:48 Koka,
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:05:49 Um
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:06:02 I use coaxial rotors and this happens still
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:06:03 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:06:32 Mind elaborating?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:07:00 With my largest helicopter (uses 8 blades. Not coaxial) I have some small propellor engines to tilt the Heli the right way
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:07:08 Like that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:07:21 ‚ÄúYou can use engines or control panels‚Äù is very broad
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:07:32 Is there a way of, not adding engines?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:01 Again, it‚Äôs very heavy
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:19 And I did an experiment, it gets worse the faster the rotor blades spin
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:24 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:33 That won‚Äôt help with tilting
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:39 It isn‚Äôt an issue of weight or balancing
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:08:57 The helicopter will always tilt (along the roll axis) to one side when flying forward like a jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:09:12 Even with a coaxial rotor set up who vu is supposed to counteract this exact problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:11:33 That makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:11:46 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:12:10 So I guess the only way to fully counteract that is an inter mesh rotor helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:12:15 Which I fortunately have one of
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:12:30 (Since they are at the same level)
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:13:23 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:13:39 It seems very very hard to effectively counter the tilt on smaller Helios
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:13:42 Helis*
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:25 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:28 It‚Äôs helic
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:31 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:34 It‚Äôs not even helic
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:36 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:14:56 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:15:13 I will always say heli tho, rings of the tongue better imo
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:15:21 Rolls*
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:20:33 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:20:52 Could I just counteract the tilt by speeding up or slowing down the rotors individually?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:23:50 I
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:23:52 K*
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:23:58 Il mess around and see if it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:25:27 Then it won‚Äôt spin
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:25:28 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:27:12 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:27:33 You misunderstood lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:27:40 It‚Äôs motor power that I‚Äôm working with rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:27:52 But for forward thrust
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:27:54 I‚Äôm using engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:28:06 I‚Äôm messing around with grav, so I don‚Äôt have any propellor blades
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:28:12 Just panels and control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:29:17 IM SO CLOSE IT ALMOST WORKS
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:30:52 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:30:54 Doesn‚Äôt work

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 06:59:51 A while ago I tried making a realistic nuke, that is, flash, mushroom cloud, ash but it just unintentionally became super laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:00:11 I mean what did I expect from a motor locked to hell bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:00:12 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:12:19 Jet packs are crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:12:39 Almost every one of my helicopters can be taken down by my friend with a jet pack
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:12:43 And he can stop planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:12:54 I must contain him
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:13:45 He flies into the rotors and flings my helicopters into the null zone
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:13:50 So I must contain him
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:14:12 Nahhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:14:19 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:14:44 I was believe it or not talking about helicopters with my younger sister and she said im a ‚ÄúYour Mom Helicopter‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:14:57 So im going to build the your money attack helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:06 It‚Äôs gonna be a spam vehicle with amogus and memes
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:11 Because hehe haha funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:14 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:45 I‚Äôve been working on my most complex build yet, a motor locked, life sized Apache guardian
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:50 First real life build
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:15:54 And it‚Äôs goin great
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:16:08 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:16:23 Rip my helis usually top out at 500
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:17:05 I think the best all round drive is a hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:17:12 Not too laggy, has throttle
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:17:18 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:17:39 Basically put a piston, and then a hover thruster with the glows part facing the moving part of the piston
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:17:48 Il draw a thingy rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:18:50 Something like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:19:18 Slow image send rip
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:19:19 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:19:31 And then put a line of cameras on one side
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:19:40 Since they won‚Äôt weld naturally when placed like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:20:06 You can put up to I think 5? Hover thrusters against the piston like that, in a line like the rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:20:19 Anything more than that and it starts to drag more that push
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:07:45 Idk what to build, any ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:07:56 Any lesser known jets or prop fighters?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:05 Oooh now
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:07 Now that
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:11 I might have to make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:40 At 3:00am with my friends I built a  sailor (alternative word) cell
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:43 I deleted it
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:45 I think
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:46 ANYWAYS
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:08:56 That‚Äôs pretty interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:09:13 any military vehicles?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:09:24 Basically just a tube and a cutter, less interesting imo
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:09:49 Crap now I do kinda wanna make a microwave
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:09:57 But, I can‚Äôt make all the buttons
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:09:58 Wellll
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:10:00 I mean I could
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:10:09 Il make a microwave lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:10:15 Lava spitters for good measure?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:10:24 Oh my
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:14:29 Il start with the keypad
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 06:22:06 Are motor driven rotors less laggy then thrust driven?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 06:22:12 Or the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:32:58 Think fast chucklenuts, favourite camo?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:35:32 I just use a motor 2 set to 45*
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:35:33 And motor lag
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:35:33 Unfortunately unless the plane is very large it‚Äôs hard to have like, flaps 10, 20, 30
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:35:58 Angle lock?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:21:11 At a loss for what to build
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:24:02 Indeed
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:24:13 Well I guess I should take some photos of my huge angle locked heli
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:24:18 Il do that rq
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:24:24 But I guess I need paint first
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:24:28 Or it‚Äôs an instant downvote
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:25:19 It‚Äôs got intermeshing tail rotors and it has side-by-side rotors in the same orientation as that huge Russian one up front
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:28:23 Got any camo ideas? <@!604147232991608842>
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 00:32:26 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:53:56 I‚Äôm thinking I should try taking photos on mobile lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:54:08 Not serving my heli properly with cat scan lines lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:54:30 Because, terrible ct scan lines
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:54:33 It‚Äôs so hard to look at
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:54:39 Even with some editing to remove them
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:05 Are they really that bad?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:09 Well il try anyway
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:16 About them?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:30 ?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:33 I‚Äôm confused
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:44 I took the photos with an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:51 Because it slightly takes lag away
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:55:56 And particles are off
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:56:05 (It doesn‚Äôt need the anchor to hover)
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:56:11 It‚Äôs just so I can easily take a photo
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 15:56:16 With those sweet sweet camera angles
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:22:33 Alxti, I know how. I CANT????????
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:24:36 Did you even read the paragraph? There is a reason it‚Äôs one of the first things I say. I cannot export photos, terrible res, and I have to go through a whole process to get it on my phone. It takes way longer and doesn‚Äôt even end up looking worth it. That‚Äôs why.
My computer is on life support, constantly has 3 cords plugged into it and it struggles to open more than a couple chrome tabs, so stop bugging me about it. I can‚Äôt.
Does that answer your question?
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:31:06 Get a hobby other than plane crazy. You saying people with bad pcs can‚Äôt post in creations? And get a better pc, I can‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt have the money yet. So unless you‚Äôre going to buy it. Shush
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:35:43 Il be applying fairly soon but for the time being I don‚Äôt have one. So that‚Äôs not a possibility.
Also like, ew. Only people with good pcs can play? 
Since you have such a good work ethic, buy me one then.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:48:26 Man I hope by responding to this I haven‚Äôt just become that guy lol
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:52:28 Sorry if I got fired up lol, I just dont have respect for people who say stuff like that.
Telling someone to get a better pc is the equivalent of telling a homeless person to just buy a house all be it less serious lol
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:54:34 Yeah, I think In general discord servers and public lobbies get pretty toxic. 
It‚Äôs the small servers I like more, where people actually respect eachother
<@456226577798135808> I‚Äôve explained this before, I can export photos but it would take a long, long time. Like I‚Äôm assuming the process would take a hour or two.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:56:45 I mean this in the kindest way please read what I said, with my current platform i cannot export a photo like that, and the alternatives are terrible resolution. It‚Äôs all around not worth it.
<@!718224997570838641> <@!401530469952389130> no I play on a laptop, but it‚Äôs basically dead
creations-chat 2021-09-02 16:59:33 There are countless ways to do it, and that‚Äôs smart. But it literally takes 15 minutes for discord to load in and like 10 for roblox
Any way I do it it will take somewhere around an hour to 45 minutes, it‚Äôs not worth it
creations-chat 2021-09-02 17:02:16 Has a spot that if I hit it hard enough it shuts off, has its power cord constantly connected, a direct internet plug, basically 0 space, a terrible antenna, the list goes on.
I‚Äôve had it for 3-4 years and it‚Äôs been used by my mom before that. I had a new pc a while ago, and it still works great. But due to some water damage it crackles, and even though I have the money my parents refuse to let me take it in for repairs for some reason. Ignoring the fact that it can 100% be recovered
creations-chat 2021-09-02 17:04:26 It‚Äôs hilarious because the computer ‚Äúthey bought‚Äù and ‚Äúthey trusted me with‚Äù can totally be repaired and they are too lazy to listen to me and bring it in lmaoooo.
<@456226577798135808> it‚Äôs a terrible feedback loop, I get frustrated at how slow it is, I damage it, it gets worse.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 17:06:46 But damn is my pc a fighter
creations-chat 2021-09-02 19:36:39 Maybe try angle locking the nose? Maybe people think it‚Äôs clunky? <@!394735782184878082>
creations-chat 2021-09-04 03:27:24 Ok
creations-chat 2021-09-04 03:38:11 Spiny rotor blade hehe haha
creations-chat 2021-09-04 03:54:06 I think it‚Äôs too late now lmao, plus I sent the unedited version a while ago. Ct scan lines but eh, it‚Äôs barebones and you see what you need to see.

Turns out making photos pretty insanely backfired
creations-chat 2021-09-04 05:51:46 Here are the unedited ones, also I already posted this creation unedited lol
creations-chat 2021-09-04 05:54:57 Yeah it was pretty tricky, used collective pitch and for some reason it would lose altitude when pitched up, not even 45‚Ä¢

Tips for improvement?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 05:57:23 Mind elaborating with long? It‚Äôs most likely the camera angle. I think it‚Äôs quite nicely proportioned, then again might look off with absolutely no armament
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:01:28 <@!705816374462906389> So cleaning the blades, using disconnectors, trails, cylinders etc for some details and better windows could improve the build?
I‚Äôve actually never heard of improving the windows lol, do you mean like smoothing out the cockpit?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:08:39 Considering the size of the aircraft and how slim it‚Äôs supposed to be I find that might be a bit difficult in a small space.
Using disconnectors and trapdoors to keep it slim, not sure about any other blocks that work
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:11:23 I guess I could motorlock a half ball over the trapdoor glass, would that look better?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:15:35 Do tell how to improve them
Understandable.
I get it lmao
The rotor blades not spinning always look a bit eerie to me tho, plus, if the rotors are bland and clean then what details are we missing out on if they are blurred
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:20:50 Ehhh, I mean yeah sure. So even alongside the normal photos people editing photos will get downvoted?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:23:54 That screen tearing is only present in that photo, it‚Äôs a simple glitch effect
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:27:27 Yeah man. Just keep at it I guess. There‚Äôs actually a fair amount of people that give good criticism here too
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:30:39 I said some, if it‚Äôs toxic talk to mods. Most of the toxic people are doing it for shits and giggles. Get over it, it just happens lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:33:41 There‚Äôs also a difference between crit and constructive crit lol. I would say that ‚Äútoxic‚Äù counts as someone breaking *you* down, not the build. After all you shouldn‚Äôt get attached to a build persay.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 16:49:42 Maybe better suited for <#384021699466756107> but could I get some rotor blade inspo? As in, which rotor blade styles do you think look the sleekest and most appealing?
Admittedly my last one didn‚Äôt look very sleek at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:51:37 Anyone here have some experience with helicopters? How do you guys style your rotor blades? Make em look sleek and appealing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:52:06 I‚Äôm talking how it‚Äôs powered, thickness etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:52:09 If that‚Äôs okay
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 23:38:33 Activate photo mode on mobile how?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 23:39:26 Well that‚Äôs a bummer
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 23:40:13 Yeah but I mean remove the buttons
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 23:40:21 And disgusting green open trapdoor buttons
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:01:21 What‚Äôs a camo you guys would like to see in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:01:29 That isn‚Äôt commonly recognized or shown?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:01:37 Why thank you
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:02:59 Oooooooo
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:02 Ooooh
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:08 Actually done that Russian one before
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:11 Please gimme more
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:13 Hhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:22 Wise words
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:29 Disruption camo
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:31 Yummy
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:03:59 Oooh those are nice blues
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:04:03 I‚Äôve never tried a gradient
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:04:06 Would look nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:05:01 Here, want me to send a photo of the build unpainted and see which ones would look nice?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:05:57 Might take me a minute
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:20 Il get an *ingame* **unedited** SCREENSHOT
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:48 For context it‚Äôs supposed to be a remake of my build from last night, also my first time making custom engine intakes which are yummy
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:55:24 Okay so finally
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:56:27 Here‚Äôs what the new version looks like unpainted
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:56:50 Landing gear freaking out in the left center lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:56:52 Roblox moment
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:57:32 It‚Äôs custom, side by side rotor helicopter, cannot tilt even lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:58:02 Nah, triple is intentional
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:58:10 Unnecessary and clunky, just how I like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:58:34 Probably looks a bit wierd from the camera angle idk, might change it later who knows
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:00:31 <@723940197456281640> got any paint ideas I should try?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:01:34 Oooh
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:01:38 Vulcan camo
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:01:39 Yum
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:27:13 Two questions, opinions on having three rudders (should I remove the central one) and do you guys have any paint scheme ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:29:17 I‚Äôm really stumped with the rudders lol, thought it looked cool but eh, I‚Äôm undecided
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:30:22 Here,
Option 1 (Center Rudder)
Option 2 (Dual Rudders)
Option 3 (Triple Rudders)
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:30:27 So sad
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:30:30 Can‚Äôt reply
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:31:33 Like putting the other rudders on the edge of the horizontal stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:31:53 Like an ospreys vertical stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:31:58 But just an extra one at the Center
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:32:47 I just want to set it apart from a generic osprey setup lol. But then again it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs fault for guessing this bananacopter is a v-22
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:34:05 Okay il get to work
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:34:34 I won‚Äôt be able to get those CRISP photos until later tonight tho rip
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:34:42 So il try to take a photo with mobile
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:34:43 Or
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 16:34:53 *the dreaded ct scan lines*
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 18:20:27 Futuristic hind, interesting
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 01:35:47 Sorry I keep asking lol, favourite camo?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:13:47 Who wore it better
creations-chat 2021-09-06 06:15:32 <@!720891502108344360> Gladly, tommorow that is lol. I have a friend who helps me take photos since I can‚Äôt on my pc. So sometime tommorow when we can call and take more photos absolutely. Sorry if that‚Äôs a bummer.
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:15:50 Yeah Dolmas
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:16:10 I used a Christmas sweater off of Pinterest for the camo reference, and I realized it looks like a dolma
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:16:13 Or a pickle
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:16:31 It‚Äôs basically a flying (insert bendy long vegetable thing here)
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:16:41 I was strongly tempted to paint it like a banana
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:18:51 This, see how the nose droops? Friends said it looked like a banana
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:20:04 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:20:21 Maybe I do that tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 06:20:29 Bananecompter paint job
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:30 Not putting it in creations because the last time an edited photo was posted there by me I had an <:nooo:787097964946259978>  experience
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:03:15 How obvious is the floating island that‚Äôs gone?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:11:36 Wow
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:24 I‚Äôm assuming this is an imported model or something but if you made that, sheeeeeesh
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:43 Sun
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:45 Fun*
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:47 Autocorrect
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:22:08 I‚Äôm out of ideas so I think il make my pet rock into a giant moving Boulder with googly eyes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:23:01 I‚Äôve had it for a while, it‚Äôs not worth it
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:23:56 It‚Äôs a fun game, you can get very creative but at times part selection can be a little bit lacking and not only that but there aren‚Äôt nearly as many Easter eggs, locations or npcs as the pc version
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:24:03 I think it‚Äôs probably worth it on pc tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:24:19 In simple planes or plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:25:08 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:26:47 I‚Äôm at a loss as to what I should name my pet rock, Se√±or Pietra or Se√±or Guijarro which are both ways to say rock or pebble I think
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:28:02 Dworn theb Rocc Jogson
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:28:40 Okay so, Se√±or Rocc?
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:30:14 Would you say that this is an improvement to my my older helo?
(Older towards the bottom)
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:39:34 Now that I look back the old rotors look disgusting, not that the new ones are perfect
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:47:46 Pardon?oh yeah lol very true
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:50:14 The old one doesn‚Äôt need motion blur since it already looks like it‚Äôs melting away <@!705816374462906389>
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:53:07 I don‚Äôt make nearly enough prop builds, maybe il see if I can who knows. After I‚Äôm done making Se√±or Rocc tho
general 2021-09-06 17:32:42 Facing the fact il have to wake up and get on a 30 minute bus ride for 8:00am every morning for school is depressing
general 2021-09-06 17:32:53 Sigh
general 2021-09-06 17:36:15 With COVID my bus came at 8:50
general 2021-09-06 17:36:23 So like, I had lots of time in the morning
general 2021-09-06 17:36:38 But now I have to wake up at like 6:30
general 2021-09-06 17:36:40 And I‚Äôm sad
general 2021-09-06 17:36:52 Preparing for an average of 7 hours of sleep isn‚Äôt fun
general 2021-09-06 17:40:22 Lmao
general 2021-09-06 17:40:39 I can‚Äôt call my friends at 4:00am anymore :(((((((
general 2021-09-06 17:40:41 So sad
general 2021-09-06 17:53:28 That‚Äôs the huge one right?
general 2021-09-06 17:53:47 I mean I would love to make it, except for the fact that my crummy pc struggles over 3k
general 2021-09-06 17:54:26 Well good news, at my dads at-least the bus comes at 8:50
So I can wake up at like 7:30
general 2021-09-06 17:55:31 Lol
general 2021-09-06 17:55:54 Only bomber I accept as S tier is the Vulcan, simply because of the aesthetic, usage and the noise
general 2021-09-06 17:56:12 Bomber*
general 2021-09-06 17:59:17 How wonderful my 28 minute bus ride is 19 minutes of walking
general 2021-09-06 18:05:57 Oen Warfare Z actually
general 2021-09-06 18:06:15 Well that‚Äôs one way to think of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 00:12:20 Editing photos is fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 00:12:37 This one is meh but whatever, it looks cool I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 01:02:47 I don‚Äôt know lol, the Kuwaiti oil field disaster is a very cool aesthetic to me.
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 01:03:12 Honestly would remove the bottom 2 if I still could
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 01:03:20 But it‚Äôs supposed to be like some huge airlift idk
general 2021-09-09 00:58:02 No one has typed for a full minute, *that‚Äôs crazy*, **plane crazy**
general 2021-09-09 00:58:33 What even is it
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:00:05 I wish there was a desert biome in plane crazy so I could make the ruined town from tenet
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:00:07 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:00:33 I could try
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:00:48 For a while now I‚Äôve wanted to try making liminal space/abandoned builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:01:30 I‚Äôm thinking for a abandoned city type building like that just stacking the buildings and completely filling the plot, then giving each set of buildings it‚Äôs own controls so it can 0g into place
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:01:35 If that makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:02:03 Oooh, imma try that
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:24:39 Model?
general 2021-09-09 01:25:48 Anyone know the model?
general 2021-09-09 01:26:30 Much smoother than a tiger
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:26:55 Oh I didn‚Äôt make it lol, I‚Äôm asking for the tank model
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:26:56 Lol
general 2021-09-09 01:27:26 
general 2021-09-09 01:27:27 Does that help?
general 2021-09-09 01:27:56 That‚Äôs what it looks like
general 2021-09-09 01:28:06 It‚Äôs a Russian turret but a very American body??
general 2021-09-09 01:28:07 Idk
general 2021-09-09 01:28:30 Oooh yeah
general 2021-09-09 01:28:34 That‚Äôs a close contender
general 2021-09-09 01:29:31 Not the same placement tho
general 2021-09-09 01:29:31 
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 01:30:53 Oh lol

plane-crazy 2021-09-09 22:43:11 Sorry I‚Äôm waiting for a friend to @
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 22:44:16 Dunno
plane-crazy 2021-09-09 23:05:06 Wing
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:28:44 Have any of you encountered anamalous creations in plane crazy, if yes. Do tell
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:29:13 That just looks badass
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:29:36 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:30:22 Well im thinking of making a small troop transport helo and making a little outpost so I have a team of scientists to investigate cancerous builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:30:34 Oh the joys of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:30:56 Out of the ordinary, game breaking, supernatural, existential etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:31:12 Both
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:31:33 I should classify what builds count as anamalous specifically
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:31:55 An example is those giant rope-trail black holes super high in the sky that trace lines across the entire map
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:32:10 Because it‚Äôs other worldly,
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:32:48 Flew into one of those once (it was pvp) and had one of the rope things literally chop my helicopter in half, therefore plummeting into the void killing 3 people
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:33:01 Compact moment
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:33:32 <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:33:59 Sadness
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:13:37 My missile is doing a wierd thing and is anchoring in the air?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:13:43 When I disconnect?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:13:48 And it only moves if I touch it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:14:52 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:15:05 The launch platform doesn‚Äôt move, the missile does
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:15:09 Missile has no anchors
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:15:31 And it like, pauses in the air and I have to physically collide with it for it to advance a frame
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:15:37 Maybe a bugged server
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:15:42 My ping and mem are fine

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:35:54 Coolio
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:36:48 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:37:26 *crying inside* I just want to spawn my fighter bomber why
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:38:20 I find that destroying ww2 era bombers is easy, distract them until they fly into the ground and then shoot them when they are immobile
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:39:10 To be fair I actually really like the design of the original jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:39:15 I should make something like it
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:39:52 Setgsy
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:40:31 The lag is so bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:40:37 Is Rick looking into this?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:40:40 Every pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:40:49 Every time this morning, every person in the lobby

general 2021-10-05 23:24:40 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:40:46 Thinking of making a real jet for once. Any jets that would be a good start (that is a more basic shape) for beginners? Basic as in I‚Äôm only really beginning to learn how to make things look clean if that makes sense.
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:40:58 I was thinking maybe f4? But that‚Äôs got a lot of angles
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:41:12 Oh and if you do have a suggestion I‚Äôm looking for something Cold War era
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:41:39 Hmmm, it‚Äôs a bit modern for me but yeah I should try that
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:41:56 So then I guess some early Cold War
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:42:07 50s-late 70s
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:42:08 Ouuuu
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:42:09 Mirage

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:46:54 That‚Äôs kinda sick
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:47:01 But would be tricky at a small scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:48:07 
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:48:10 Tada mirage 3
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:48:17 Oh it‚Äôs a gif?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:49:49 Doing a quick calculation to scale it properly the wingspan would be 11 blocks in total
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:50:05 Literally no reason to get mad at them, relax dude
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:50:32 I‚Äôve been bamboozled
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:50:41 Damn.
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:50:44 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:51:57 And 2 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:52:07 Should I bump up the scale by a half block?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:52:14 And one extra on each wing?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:52:17 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:52:38 Fair
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:52:43 Il shoot for 2 blocks first
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:57:08 Should I hide the motor lock?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:57:09 Like put it a block under?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:57:36 Huh? Nah it‚Äôs a mirage
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:57:40 Doesn‚Äôt look like it yet lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:57:53 This
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:58:22 Anyways does the motorlock really matter?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:58:26 Eyesore?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:58:44 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 14:58:50 Aight il fix it lol

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 15:05:47 Wow cool helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:12:59 Alright mirage just needs landing gear, weapons and control surfaces on the delta wing. Then we‚Äôre done
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:13:24 The mirage iii*
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:13:29 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:13:59 Any panting ideas for the mirage?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:14:28 Ah shit, here we go again
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:22:49 Apologies for literal screenshot, thoughts on the mirage iii so far?
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:24:51 Any ideas? Il obviously paint it n stuff too lololol. Ideas for extra details I mean. (Il add the nose thingy)
<@!714878625484243101> how so? You seem quite experienced give me some tips for improvement. Confused with your second point, it‚Äôs pretty vague
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:35:12 Not circular but best I can get with the conveyor part. Oh wait actually
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:39:06 How‚Äôs this
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:41:48 If you‚Äôre talking about the mirage that‚Äôs why I chose it. This is my first jet build so I‚Äôm trying something simple
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:44:12 Honestly the body doesn‚Äôt look too bad in my opinion. I suggest trying to motorlock some parts in to smooth out the edges and make custom control surfaces on the wings if you know how.
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:46:15 Just suggestions üòõ EW I HATE DISCORD EMOJIS
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:50:41 Mirage needs thrust then it‚Äôs almost done
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:50:58 At the frontish where the wings and the intakes me the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 16:51:14 ^
creations-chat 2021-10-09 16:53:39 Np
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 18:16:54 Mirage is almost done but disappointingly only flies at 600 speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 23:13:21 I see on some peoples missile builds there are springs?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 23:13:23 Why is that
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:01:09 What‚Äôs the ¬¥legacy¬†‚Äò property for Missiles?
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:01:12 Or rockets I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:02:56 That‚Äôs not unpopular I don‚Äôt think
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:03:14 It‚Äôs just that as it is now interior or real scale craft like that, Atleast that detailed is extremely difficult
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:03:27 Ohhhh
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:03:41 Yeah that‚Äôs just a roblox physics moment
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 01:03:56 Rick would need to create a whole separate aerodynamics thing inside the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:10:53 Would anyone wanna do a ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù tank battle some time?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:11:11 I‚Äôm coming up with some rules and guidelines to make tanks n stuff and have a battle in a private server or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:13:50 Would anyone be interested in something like that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:17:23 Would anyone wanna do a ¬´¬†realistic¬†¬ª tank battle? With like a couple rules n stuff?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 17:27:47 Looks sickk
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:28:47 Anyone here build tanks?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:29:07 That‚Äôs fun lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:29:30 I kinda wanna have like, a large scale tank battle but with some rules in place? Trying to find anyone who might be interested
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:54:09 Where can we find info on pc2? In announcements yeah?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 17:57:43 No I was confirming lol whatever lmao
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 22:59:23 Any tips for making wheels bigger than 5x5?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 16:26:42 Fighting the urge to make biblically accurate angels in pc <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 16:32:16 Honestly fair point
general 2021-12-21 16:32:29 Sureeee
general 2021-12-21 16:32:55 I just remember alor of talk about people saying that it would be ready in December lol and the month is already almost over

general 2021-12-21 16:35:15 Already fell for it
general 2021-12-21 16:35:16 Never again
general 2021-12-21 16:35:48 Won‚Äôt having an infinitely generated map have some impact on performance?
general 2021-12-21 16:36:18 Yikes
general 2021-12-21 16:36:49 That makes sense
general 2021-12-21 16:37:20 Because I feel (atleast compared to pc 1) performance would dramatically decrease if it was an actual infinitely generated map with structures n stuff
general 2021-12-21 16:37:47 Doesn‚Äôt it make sense to just have a slightly larger map, or like, islands with more space inbetween?
general 2021-12-21 16:38:23 Cuz like, with a server of 20 people if it‚Äôs infinite what are the chances of people meeting up with eachother if there isn‚Äôt a. Radar or b. Some way to waypoint your friends or set cords
general 2021-12-21 16:38:58 Looks tasty
general 2021-12-21 16:39:28 That‚Äôs true
general 2021-12-21 16:39:43 But like, the generation would still be affected because it‚Äôs flying not walking
general 2021-12-21 16:39:56 Like on 2b2t they banned elytra because of rapid chunk gen right?
general 2021-12-21 16:40:13 So if 20 people are flying around at Mach 5 generating chunks‚Ä¶
general 2021-12-21 16:40:25 All be it on a roblox server
general 2021-12-21 16:40:54 Well honestly I kind of like the ‚Äúbland‚Äù terrain of plane crazy
general 2021-12-21 16:41:00 It has its own aesthetic I guess
general 2021-12-21 16:41:25 Sounds about right lol

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 19:04:25 Does the body look alright?
plane-crazy 2021-12-30 19:04:31 It‚Äôs a helicopter, I know it kinda looks like a dog I got confused too
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:56:06 What key binds do you guys use for helicopters?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:56:45 I use shift and control to gain and descend, Q and E to yaw, W and S to pitch and A and D to roll. If I have forward thrust I use Z and X too
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:57:10 Oh and Z and X if the blade is thrust powered and needs to ‚Äústart up‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:57:25 Anyways, I‚Äôm just trying to see if some key binds are easier to use idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:21:40 Yeah! Dual control!
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:22:43 The way I do my jets is, yaw and pitch are automatically mouse (motor 2s) then the roll is controlled by me so I can level out or whatever, and then I either have control surfaces on the ends of the flaps I guess? (The part I mean) for fine tuning and hard turns
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:22:56 Alternatively you could use prop engines hidden in the wings and nose for sharp turns
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:23:46 I kind of like having too, the plane levels out on its own lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:23:52 I do it intentionally so I can invert
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:24:28 Yeah! I experienced that with my mirage
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:25:37 For shits and giggles im going to combine the Cheyenne and the hind
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:27:00 I hate it when I have a build that‚Äôs great but it has a flaw and I don‚Äôt have the energy to fix it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:27:17 Do you motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:27:43 ^
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:28:10 Helium, my friend
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:28:52 The engineer urge to make a helicopter with a functioning tail rotor and no helium simply so it can beautifully spin out
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 17:30:38 I only recently figured out how to stop helicopters rolling with outward facing and engines and blade flapping I‚Äôm not mad
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 19:41:14 Concept Maybe? Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 19:41:47 Crap, I just realized the landing gear wouldn‚Äôt work unless the back was a lot longer lol
creations-chat 2022-01-01 00:05:14 Isn‚Äôt it tilted upwards? I mean the nose is large but the upwards pitch affects perspective so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too bad at all
creations-chat 2022-01-01 00:14:48 Yeah I agree
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:51:25 Mind if I give my BASED opinion on tutorials?
Damn dude‚Ä¶
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:56:50 Tutorials aren‚Äôt a bad thing on their own. I mean think about it, lego set instructions are basically tutorials. You build, deconstruct and rebuild until you can basically do it from memory, or change it to something new that suits you. That‚Äôs the same principle. They are a good place to start, especially considering the other options new players choose could be shredders, spam vehicles etc. If you‚Äôre ACTUALLY TAKING THE TIME to analyze the systems of someone‚Äôs build, you can use that information to be if it your future builds. Like, the way I learned how to motorlock was my friend showed me, but a lot of people I‚Äôve played with have learned form builds, and then taking that one system to build something completely new around it. All things said, tutorials are a starting point, but you aren‚Äôt learning if you stay inside your comfort zone or analyzing how things work. If someone has a couple tutorials and they give credit, who cares. It‚Äôs only when people discredit and continuously repeat tutorials without progressing building skill that it is a bad thing.

(Good lord so sorry that‚Äôs long)

(Oh and before you continue, whatever situation is going on I‚Äôm not aware of. This is an unbiased opinion on tutorials themselves, if someone is posting a tut in creations though, to hell with em‚Äô.)
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:59:09 S e r i o u s l y XD
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:01:32 And I 1000% agree with you on that point. I used a few tutorials when I started out building to learn how motor 2s work, how rotor blades work. But I‚Äôm using it to learn, not as a cheat sheet yknow? It‚Äôs kind of like, understand the formula until you know it by heart, but don‚Äôt sneak a cheat sheet into the test.
(The test being the gamescape/the creations channel. Also, there‚Äôs a whole other debate about understanding and memorization but I hope you get what I mean)
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:05:49 *‚ÄùWell in some sense I feel as though I took what is already there and made it better than the creator couldv'e done. I see it as maybe a team effort and after I changed it I decided to change it again and again so it was more and more of what I can consider my own creation.‚Äù*

The problem is in your first couple phrases. Firstly, you can‚Äôt make someone ELSES build better, kinda. Because their final mental image of a build would be completely different from yours, regardless of the level of execution achieved. Not only that but the ‚Äúteam effort‚Äù stance is flawed. Unless you give credit to them it isn‚Äôt a team effort, and you can‚Äôt take full responsibility for a build that you claim isn‚Äôt completely yours. That logic doesn‚Äôt make too much sense.
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:09:16 I‚Äôm going to retype my message as a starter if that‚Äôs cool

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:11:51 I think I‚Äôm general, to stay out of these controversies if you will. Make builds that are YOUR own. And if it‚Äôs a tutorial, regardless of how many changes you made you need to credit the creator (original)
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:12:24 Can‚Äôt you just send it here?
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:12:39 Sure
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:12:44 Send the original and the mod
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:03 I honestly think we should talk to Rick about this
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:22 Having a team make a sort of rule guide (looked over by moderators of course)
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:31 It wouldn‚Äôt be that easy,
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:44 I mean for tutorials and crediting
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:48 Because it‚Äôs a huge problem

plane-crazy 2022-01-10 01:28:00 I wonder if you could reverse rotor torque on a heli by using a gyro
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 01:28:01 Like
plane-crazy 2022-01-10 01:28:34 Above the rotor, instead of putting ballasts in the actual body of the helicopter you could put a bunch in a sort of ‚Äúwheel‚Äù spinning in the opposite direction above the rotor
