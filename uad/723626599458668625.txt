general 2021-05-04 19:35:35 well no i mean i want them to be throttleable but i still want the ability to cut power or full power
general 2021-05-04 19:35:54 it has to be fast
general 2021-05-04 19:35:58 ohhhh

plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:03:45 i could never do planes lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:04:25 im a rocket kinda guy so i just build stuff like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:43:07 is there a way to make two blocks next to each other but not connect?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:43:12 i really need that
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:43:43 how would i do that tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 16:44:46 ,_,

plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:41:52 but i just finished my starship
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:00 im considering making superheavy for it too idk tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:14 it would have to fold
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:19 but i COULD make it work
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:20 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:26 my current starship has a launch pad and launch tower
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:29 people can get in it too
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:36 it can do the bellyflop and looks exactly like a starship
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:42:42 i think people would really like it

plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:21:32 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:22:15 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:23:12 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:23:14 belly flop
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:24:22 they arent thats how theyre supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:24:26 weird angles but theyre right
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:25:35 yes thats the one
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:26:04 ill try to make them smaller but cant gurantee it working then
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:27:01 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:28:04 me?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:28:43 yeah its supposed to be there
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:29:00 i set it at the right angle so when i press button for them they go to the right angle for a perfect bellyflop
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:29:06 no but i cant really do much about it
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:29:19 bro i dont know how ffs
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:29:57 ok i will try it
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:30:21 theres no channel named fiery oblivion
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:31:10 is it possible you mean just rens?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:31:41 nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:32:16 stfu thats great
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:33:12 obviously but that doesnt mean your starship isnt good
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:33:30 it still is good
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:43:45 im trying motorlocking, but it just falls off here, what am i doing wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:47:34 now the setup is this
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:47:36 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:47:47 but only goes this far
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:47:48 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:47:50 how do i make it go further
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:48:11 ohhhh wait
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:48:25 the motor2 is my actual block tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:09 oh?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:12 yeeees
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:49:31 so wait the first middle connection between the next set of three motor locks thats where my blocks go?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:50:06 all my blocks after this in the motorlock go here right
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:50:39 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:03 you can see this relative to the rocket tip right
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:14 all the cylinders line up
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:18 in the middle cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:28 middle cylinder before i launch it
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:32 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:33 im just
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 20:51:34 gonna test it
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:05:30 turns out motorlock is impossible on this starship
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:08:33 nvm its not impossible but it looks weird
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:08:40 how do i make the motorlocked motors not appear
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:09:13 not really an option
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:09:45 so no matter what im gonna be judged pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:16:35 turns out i literally fucking cant do anything about it, you  done now?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:24:23 ???
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:24:27 what do control panels have to do with anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 21:25:24 <@!386274857668706314>
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 22:46:09 why are you stilling telling me this shit after i said its impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 22:46:19 it doesnt even matter
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:16:19 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:16:40 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:18:08 also heres my nifty lil land speeder
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:18:19 no motorlocking which makes it easy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:19:17 built in hover engine too which can make it top speeds of around 500 across the base mat
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:19:33 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:19:58 yes but i cantr eally do anything about it
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:20:09 not sure, ill have to test it
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:20:10 brb
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:21:59 yeah it seems that 500 is the max
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:22:30 not much but pretty quick for a lil contraption
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:24:52 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:15:04 yeah fr no matter what you do water always gets in so whats the point
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:15:13 its no fun if the whole entire point of it doesnt even work
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:00 FR
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:16 we need better water physics then i gurantee more subs
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:21 we need more balance in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:26 not just spaceships and aircrafts
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:28 subs too
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:16:59 fr
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:17:28 same
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:18:00 just an overall lack in care for water from the devs
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:18:12 i think they just sorta fell in love with the rest and forgot about what its like in the sea
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:18:17 and thats reasonable
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:18:21 but i think its well over time for changing it
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:44:26 oo mech legs
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:44:43 i used to be a mech god lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:45:02 sad thing is i deleted my good ones and now i only got one set of legs left
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:48:13 hol up i got pics
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:48:56 never finished it
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:49:00 but its pretty nifty
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:49:20 i made it way before dream was even a yer
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 11:49:22 yter

general 2021-05-07 14:24:27 holy fucking shit bro you dug up something from the first version of plane crazy about 5 years ago??? gg that must be the finished game tbh
general 2021-05-07 14:25:03 and tbh the engines dont really make sense a lot of the time so twr would be chaos
general 2021-05-07 14:25:14 tf u mean bruh 😂

general 2021-05-07 14:27:51 if you want a small build
general 2021-05-07 14:27:54 you can only fit so much fuel
general 2021-05-07 14:28:00 until you run out and having to start over
general 2021-05-07 14:28:04 wtf is the point in starting over
general 2021-05-07 14:28:05 what
general 2021-05-07 14:28:24 you get to a point and then oops ya crash and burn unable to move having to start over
general 2021-05-07 14:29:35 EXACTLY
general 2021-05-07 14:29:44 the huge engine isnt even all that powerful and uses tons of fuel
general 2021-05-07 14:29:52 you need more engines
general 2021-05-07 14:29:53 then more fuel
general 2021-05-07 14:29:55 then more engines
general 2021-05-07 14:29:57 and more fuel
general 2021-05-07 14:29:59 its a loop
general 2021-05-07 14:30:00 endless
