creations-chat 2020-07-09 04:39:40 i might do a pixel art, what should i do
creations-chat 2020-07-09 04:43:12 i kinda wanna make this image
creations-chat 2020-07-09 05:06:38 The scale you are using is slightly smaller than it should be if a roblox character is supposed to be the average height of a person. Roblox characters are 2 blocks tall and if you use your scale of 1m to 1 block that makes the average person 200 cm or 6'5" compared to your plane
creations-chat 2020-07-09 05:07:06 I use 2.33 feet per block as my scale but thats slightly larger than it should be.
creations-chat 2020-07-09 05:07:58 when using my scale, the plane would be 27 blocks long, which is more accurate
creations-chat 2020-07-09 05:12:11 yea
creations-chat 2020-07-09 05:13:40 2.5 feet per block is probably the most accurate scale
creations-chat 2020-07-09 23:41:45 i made a coaxial swashplate!
creations-chat 2020-07-09 23:42:01 yea
creations-chat 2020-07-09 23:43:02 idk i just made a swashplate and then hooked it up to two counterrotating blades

general 2020-08-20 23:24:58 <@!551806781609869313> if mach 1.4 (1074 mph) is 8000 sps (2880000 studs per hour), that means that a mile is equal to 2681 studs, which means that there are 1.96 feet per stud, which makes a roblox character (5 studs tall) 9.8 feet tall lol.
general 2020-08-20 23:37:14 20 studs is not 1 meter
general 2020-08-20 23:37:56 bruh
general 2020-08-20 23:38:20 i just use the average height of a human as the height of a roblox character so its realisitc
general 2020-08-20 23:38:30 5' 7" is average human height
general 2020-08-20 23:39:30 cause if roblox characters are 25 cm tall it ruins plane crazy builds
general 2020-08-20 23:40:02 a cessna 172 has a 10.9728m wingspan
general 2020-08-20 23:40:20 if you make it the same scale as a roblox character (1 block = 12.5 cm
general 2020-08-20 23:40:46 it makes it a whopping 87.7824 blocks wide
general 2020-08-20 23:42:41 wdym
general 2020-08-20 23:43:40 oh
general 2020-08-20 23:44:46 hm
general 2020-08-20 23:45:48 wait waht plane are you making
general 2020-08-20 23:45:53 that needs to go that fast
general 2020-08-20 23:45:56 ok
general 2020-08-20 23:46:12 are you making it to scale compared to the roblox character?
general 2020-08-20 23:46:44 i can calculate how fast in sps it should go if u want
general 2020-08-20 23:46:50 whats its wingspan in blocks
general 2020-08-20 23:47:11 ok thx
general 2020-08-20 23:49:57 ok so the plane irl has 39 foot wingspan so the scale of the plane is 3.545 feet per block
general 2020-08-20 23:50:20 sorry for using feet lol
general 2020-08-20 23:51:07 yeah, if you use a roblox character as 25 cm tall it is huge
general 2020-08-20 23:51:40 it would be 94 blocks wide if it were roblox character scale
general 2020-08-20 23:51:49 lol so u cant use 12.5 cm per block
general 2020-08-20 23:53:36 wdym
general 2020-08-20 23:53:54 yeah
general 2020-08-20 23:54:18 yeah
general 2020-08-20 23:54:36 the plane is the right size, were just trying to find how fast it should go
general 2020-08-20 23:55:06 nah
general 2020-08-20 23:55:11 lol
general 2020-08-20 23:55:23 lol im calculating it rn
general 2020-08-20 23:56:04 the issue is that if a stud is 1/20 of a meter, it makes the plane supposed to be 94 blocks wide
general 2020-08-20 23:56:11 so we cant use that scale
general 2020-08-20 23:56:23 thats the issue
general 2020-08-20 23:56:40 that speed would only be correct if the plane was 94 blocks wide
general 2020-08-20 23:57:00 lol thats why i made 2 blocks = 5' 7"
general 2020-08-20 23:57:15 yea lol i hate it
general 2020-08-20 23:57:32 why does 12" = 1' and 5280' = 1 mile lol
general 2020-08-20 23:57:46 yea
general 2020-08-20 23:58:04 <@!551806781609869313> so for ur plane 1.41818182 feet/s = 1stud/s
general 2020-08-20 23:58:19 lol
general 2020-08-20 23:58:29 rip
general 2020-08-20 23:58:36 im gonna calculate now
general 2020-08-20 23:58:46 what was F100D top speed?
general 2020-08-20 23:58:58 mph?
general 2020-08-20 23:59:23 k thx
general 2020-08-20 23:59:58 so 1mph = 1.03418803stud/s
general 2020-08-21 00:00:23 which means that 923mph is 954.555552 sps
general 2020-08-21 00:00:44 but that is for only the F100 that u made
general 2020-08-21 00:00:53 ok
general 2020-08-21 00:01:28 so ill use the average height of person as 1.7018 meters. is that ok?
general 2020-08-21 00:02:01 idk i converted 5'7" to metric
general 2020-08-21 00:02:10 google says thats average human
general 2020-08-21 00:02:25 k
general 2020-08-21 00:02:33 yea
general 2020-08-21 00:02:45 0.8509 meters is 1 block
general 2020-08-21 00:03:14 lol
general 2020-08-21 00:03:26 yea 4 blocks is about right based on the one i saw
general 2020-08-21 00:04:58 k i just did the math and 1m/s is the same as 2.93806558 studs per second
general 2020-08-21 00:05:31 but thats only if 1 block is 0.85 meters
general 2020-08-21 00:06:04 wait for waht
general 2020-08-21 00:06:39 yea that seems right
general 2020-08-21 00:06:48 lol

bug-reports 2020-09-02 01:37:10 Gyroscopic precession is completely broken!
bot-central 2020-09-02 01:45:30 &suggest
Gyroscopic precession
[GAMEPLAY]
This is in between a suggestion and a bug.
Gyroscopic precession is almost completely broken in plane crazy. In real life, the motion of something is delayed 90° after the force is applied. In plane crazy it is delayed to about 45°, and this makes flying helicopters and other things with heavy spinning things extremely difficult. 

You can see on my swashplate controlled heli that when i pitch forward and backwards, the helicopter also tilts left and right.
https://streamable.com/g2uqqw
Explanation behind why motion is delayed 90°:

bug-reports 2020-09-03 03:48:05 is it 4 blade?
bug-reports 2020-09-03 03:48:36 yeah all thats doing is tilting the angle of the whole rotor
bug-reports 2020-09-03 03:48:51 not individual blades

bug-reports 2020-09-03 03:49:11 move to general?

general 2020-09-03 03:50:45 yeah
general 2020-09-03 03:50:49 no cyclic on that
general 2020-09-03 03:51:23 they controlled that by tilting the whole rotor forward
general 2020-09-03 03:51:43 yeah, there wasnt cyclic on that
general 2020-09-03 03:51:49 ik
general 2020-09-03 03:52:01 that wasnt changing individual blade angles
general 2020-09-03 03:52:19 ... what
general 2020-09-03 03:52:40 bruh do you see how theyre controlling it
general 2020-09-03 03:52:49 theyre tilting the entire collective and rotor
general 2020-09-03 03:52:52 not just blades
general 2020-09-03 03:53:05 are you looking at the same thing as me?

general 2020-09-03 03:53:25 lemme see taht
general 2020-09-03 03:53:46 yep its the sae thing
general 2020-09-03 03:54:49 they used a motor 2 to change the angle it tilts
general 2020-09-03 03:55:07 yea lol it does
general 2020-09-03 03:55:11 it wasnt real roll
general 2020-09-03 03:55:17 wll, kinda
