plane-crazy 2019-11-08 15:07:10 We cannot see too much due to the nighttime, but I actually work in a replica of the Vortex Fighter from Base Wars: The Land
plane-crazy 2019-11-08 15:08:19 Anyway the main problem I have is that despite 8 wings (4 for vertical and 4 for horizontal), the plane is literally impossible to turn

|Name|
LaWodonaise's BWP No.1
|Description|
The first model of a serie of Vortex Fighter hommages, the No.1 has served the fundations for the next variations. The final model has been the result of a long line of attempts to control the monstrous engine blasting the plane in no time. Quite difficult to control due to the massive propulsion, but is without a double capable to outrun most aircrafts with speed alone.
