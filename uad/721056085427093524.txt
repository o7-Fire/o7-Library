plane-crazy 2020-11-17 23:35:54 ?suggest My suggestion is big bit i think the creator may like it. 1. i think you should expand the ocean/ make it deeper as well. this would make space for large boats. 2. You should create a flat piece of land for testing vehicles. 3. make a drag strip and a race track for race/drag build testing/racing

creations-chat 2021-03-20 20:12:07 not really i have been looking at online images and models. they all have this shape. the top is a sort of stretched distorted diamond and some proportions may be off but that is because of the wing moving functionality i have added. it also may be a little off because i was making it so the wings would line up with the elevators when folded back.
creations-chat 2021-03-20 20:30:25 ik i said its not done i am still balancing the aircraft at the front thats why its not there
