help 2018-11-20 17:46:44 What are 0.9 blocks used for?
help 2018-11-20 18:11:30 is the shorter part of the 0.9 not suppose to attach to anything because it does that for me.

bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:29:18 Heatseeking missiles do not heatseek 90% of the time, even at point blank range
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:18 but it's obviously scripted to be heatseeking.
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:44 Well i'm just reporting that it looks scripted to be heatseeking but doesn't work well at all.
bug-reports 2018-11-26 23:23:43 Now the missiles don't work at all. You can't fire them
bug-reports 2018-11-26 23:24:06 i am in pvp
bug-reports 2018-11-28 00:31:52 rockets are going mental, they just don't make any thrust sometimes.
bug-reports 2018-11-29 22:05:11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5SJNXDc48k&feature=youtu.be:   Fix your missiles
bug-reports 2018-11-29 22:17:25 Fix your too rockets while you're at fixing missiles.
bug-reports 2018-11-30 04:12:51 The rocket bug can't be fixed? It just sits there with no thrust at all.
bug-reports 2018-11-30 04:13:46 Sometimes during take off it just stops making thrust even tho it's on.
bug-reports 2018-12-02 00:22:13 ikr i hate when that happens.
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:02:52 Make PVP rockets not glitch your aircraft by pulling on it when you fire them.
bug-reports 2018-12-02 17:34:40 Fix rockets, they do no damage to fast planes speeding at you but they can kill you with their rockets.
