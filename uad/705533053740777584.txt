plane-crazy 2021-10-22 14:18:25 i fully understand that the nose on most mirages is practically impossible

general 2021-10-24 03:59:08 if you set your gravity to 0, and then turn on your jet pack, you will go up at a certain speed, that speed regularly is how much thrust the jetpack produces so that it counters gravitational force
general 2021-10-24 03:59:50 so just convert that speed to m/s since gravity is 9.8 m/s^2

creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:42:12 do you think, the people who lost their lives whilst fighting for their country, should be thrown in with those who didn't?

why do you think they gave those who died their own holiday?
