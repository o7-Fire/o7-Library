plane-crazy 2020-09-08 06:27:33 epic
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 06:28:35 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 06:28:42 it kinda does look like a wh40k ship
creations-chat 2020-09-08 06:35:26 could we have a technical things channel bc i cant understand how conveyor engines work
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:55:11 i have the new speed record lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:55:35 a speed of 19,160,438
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:57:12 hm i need to find ways to increase the speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:57:28 ~~my goal is to reach 30,000,000~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:58:06 how do we reach inf
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:58:27 these questions have puzzled Plane Crazy engineers for years
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:58:39 it is?
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:58:44 how oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:59:06 lol but i clipped my parachute onto the fans
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 08:59:35 you realise when you go to crazy speeds your text bubble begins to go ***C R A Z Y***
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 09:00:30 when your text bubble begins to w a r p
general 2020-09-09 03:44:33 she  be tall
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:47:32 honestly the wiki needs to be updated or something
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:48:49 all my creations are digusting looking
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:49:53 has anyone tried making a hyperfast barrel gun
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:03 like barrels that have magnet engines in them
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:08 or conveyor
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:50:46 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:51:03 we should gather all the tutorials for plane crazy and gather them into one place
creations-chat 2020-09-11 13:56:03 **not when theres an entire army of shredders**
creations-chat 2020-09-11 14:03:54 i like engines exposed it adds a technical side to the build?
~~gets thrown out by all the plane crazy builders~~
general 2020-09-17 15:13:57 no?
general 2020-09-18 02:54:40 factorio
the great whirlpool of time
general 2020-09-18 03:25:46 i saw a 20-shredder army and i was like **GTFO**
general 2020-09-18 03:27:18 ~~imagine not sacrificing 2% of your military budget every year so you can put it into NASA, potentially granting you a huge headstart in the space industry~~
creations-chat 2020-09-20 04:28:08 oooh iron harvest
creations-chat 2020-09-20 04:28:29 *insert saxony joke*
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:15:06 or just something destructible
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:15:36 like we could have a building or something
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:16:19 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:17:11 *bruh i suggested destructible buildings which would be fun*
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:17:48 player-made buildings?
ok lemme make some building for me to destroy then
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:15 hmmmm
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:35 **OH YES**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:18:59 perhaps we could do the atomic bomb thing where theres a shockwave that topples trees
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:19:17 or something like that idk
but buildings is just fun
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:19:35 collapsing stuff is always fun
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:20:21 **yeah but destructible terrain**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:20:40 we need destructible terrain then bombers would be noice
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:21:14 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:21:36 heh i have a new gamemode idea: carrier pvp
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:00 so basically two carriers try to destroy each other and there are 10 plots on each carrier
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:16 kinda like any plane battle game but you get to make your own planes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:34 **but with custom planes**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:22:53 we can just ban the shredders lol
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:23:36 **hey can we add destructible towers**
`warned for 9/11 joke`
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:23:52 **b r u h**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:12 hm yes
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:30 **ono**
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:47 well tbf that was slightly inappropriate to use... that term
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:25:59 but yeah plane wars would be nice
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:26:16 kinda like custom plane zeppelin wars i would play that
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:19 __Plane Wars Idea__
Goal the game: uh capture objectives abc
players start on two sides of the map in hangars with 10 plots each (ten players per team), players can spawn their designs from plane crazy normal gamemode and also build new planes on the fly.
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:40 yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:28:58 <#384021699466756107> ?
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:29:14 lets move the convo there
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:29:20 so hello
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:29:33 yeah plane wars gamemode
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:29:35 hello?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:30:40 hm
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:30:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:30:48 so plane wars idea
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:31:32 hangar on each side of the map where you can design craft on the go (so you can like uh design special craft for the unique situation) and spawn designs you made?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:31:53 **thats what the normal gamemode is for**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:32:40 also uh what if we add a monetary cost to every block which would prevent people from building over the top builds *while* still limiting the builders to the normal gamemode
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:33:22 in game currency
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:33:27 like zeppelin war points?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:33:32 you know that game
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:33:39 yeah so it would be like starcraft
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:33:47 rts-like with custom planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 02:34:08 but then it would probably take:
`Estimated development time: 129993939939 years`
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:47:02 !help
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:48:29 &suggest
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:48:32 nope
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:48:33 yeah
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:48:34 ok
bot-central 2020-10-03 02:50:49 ?rhelp
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 08:35:27 by the way what do you guys normally use for keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 08:35:37 like i normally use q and e for altitude
creations-chat 2020-10-03 10:07:26 wait for ranks do we have to do video proof?
creations-chat 2020-10-03 10:07:42 just asking
creations-chat 2020-10-03 10:09:54 thoughts on biplane design? i know im a nub
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 11:21:11 motorlock?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:00 i dont understand why so many people here do real life tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:13:11 your line has been redacted by the **r e a l  l i f e  g o d s**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:26 look at my train wreck of a plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:16:30 also isnt it so easy to get rocket then anything else
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:16:40 its literally big rocket send big block into sky
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:19:56 **MAN THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:37 **someone should add a Hybrid Supreme rank**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:53 its where you get master supreme but you do it only using one craft
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:22 so you have to build a robot-VTOL-aircraft-groundship-rocket-train
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:46 a plane with landing gears is a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:13 what considers as a ground vehicle lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:23 is there some rule on whats a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:59 theres a fine distinction between "aircraft with landing gear" and "hybrid" i suppose
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:23:10 howd you get no life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:24:04 i still stand by my belief that rocket is the easiest, perhaps tied with ship
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:27:40 No Life requires: No Life
`Recursion Error`
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:58:58 anyone has any game recommendations?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:07:27 I suggest to you Horizontal-Vertical Takeoff and Landing craft
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:07:39 or the HVTOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:08:05 this means  when it takes off or lands it also needs to move horizontally
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:08:10 ~~its totally not a plane~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:08:55 **the HVTOL we have successfully invented a new term**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:09:40 ah and the nimitz is actually a NVTBVL
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:09:57 No Vertical Takeoff but Vertical Landing when it sinks to the bottom of the sea
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:10:30 **everything is actually just a variation of VTOL**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:11:03 its a HVTOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:11:18 rockets are VTBNVL
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:12:02 Cars are actually sideways VTOLS
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:12:46 Ships are VL craft
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:12:50 since they sink vertically 
and thats totally landing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:13:49 **it technically hovers above terrain**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:14:08 water is not terrain
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:14:20 *the sea bed is terrain*
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:14:36 water is simply a slight obstruction
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:15:09 Can cars drive on water?
Even when planes scream terrain when about to crash into water
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:15:37 **ahhhhhh**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:15:39 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:15:51 i shall now stop debating the logic of VTOL classification
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:16:07 we need code blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:16:11 like simple code blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:17:17 tgpd
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:17:21 what?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:18:15 **ebic**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:18:42 **h o w**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:18:59 **bruh send him some materials**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:19:01 dont be toxic
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:19:32 nah watch tutorials for mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:19:39 but dont build tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:19:56 Uh: Tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 01:20:38 so basically guideline for tutorial:
How to build a basic mech (Good, since it's basic mechanics and will teach you to build future mechs)
How to build firebird mech (**N O**)
general 2020-10-04 01:32:43 woah game uncool my building skills are bad but they arent that bad
general 2020-10-04 01:33:24 where should i report this bug
general 2020-10-04 01:43:40 theyre harder than most builds but ppl dont like  them
general 2020-10-04 01:43:47 they prefer ships, apparently
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:24:47 Question: for rocket rank can we use multistage rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:25:15 it does say all blocks need to be attached
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:26:36 ah ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:26:39 thx
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:34:01 do you guys know how to make carriers with deployable vehicles?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:37:26 this will be my deployable sub
im totally using it correctly btw
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:41:07 that was fast
creations-chat 2020-10-27 10:01:36 it could be some sort of realistic design or something but if it's not remove the symbol
general 2020-10-28 10:23:14 so thats just a random ping
general 2020-10-28 10:23:17 not a ghost ping
general 2020-10-28 10:23:37 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
general 2020-10-28 10:23:58 anyone have any tips on having the determination to do a craft more than 700 blocks?
general 2020-10-31 02:42:16 im waiting for my rank request now
also theres a dumb shader i found
general 2020-10-31 08:34:05 test
general 2020-10-31 08:34:13 yeah boiii
general 2020-10-31 08:34:28 im happy being shipwright I lol
general 2020-10-31 08:34:50 baby steps
general 2020-10-31 08:35:20 it does look like a sim city map
general 2020-10-31 08:35:25 what program r u using
general 2020-10-31 08:35:51 oh world painter
general 2020-10-31 08:36:13 does world painter support cubic chunks
general 2020-10-31 08:36:22 i'd think building 5000 block-tall mountains would be fun
general 2020-10-31 08:36:26 oh
general 2020-10-31 08:36:30 ok
general 2020-10-31 08:36:58 bc its spoilt milk
yeah totally
general 2020-10-31 08:37:16 spoilt milk
general 2020-10-31 08:39:30 cubic chunks makes my computer catch on fire
general 2020-10-31 08:39:38 its performance is *really bad*
general 2020-10-31 08:39:53 world painter is great
general 2020-10-31 08:40:21 especially with cubic chunks
general 2020-10-31 08:40:32 big bloob
general 2020-10-31 08:40:36 of mountain
general 2020-10-31 08:40:52 no thats world painter
general 2020-10-31 08:41:46 hydraulic erosion map generation can generate extremely high quality maps
general 2020-10-31 08:41:50 you can check them out
general 2020-10-31 08:44:45 it looks epic
general 2020-10-31 08:44:50 epic map
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:51:10 uh
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:51:13 spring and seats
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:51:17 but dont do it
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:51:26 its annoying and stops builders from building
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:51:30 so you better not do it
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:52:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:52:10 we'll basically hate you
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:52:16 and throw pitchforks at you
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:52:32 and in pvp we'll get the shredder bug people to kill you
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:53:15 but yes it;s springs and seats
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:57:31 someone already drew an illustration for you bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:57:46 its a detailed illustration completely describing the mechanics of a kidnapper van
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 08:58:03 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/771793424923230228
general 2020-10-31 09:16:05 *damn*
general 2020-10-31 09:16:07 those are nice
general 2020-10-31 09:16:16 and they're way too much
general 2020-10-31 09:16:17 uh
general 2020-10-31 09:16:26 why are there so many
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:30:39 is he still trying to make a kidnapper van?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:30:45 dont teach him
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:30:55 we don't need another person trying to kidnap me while im trying to build
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:31:26 use rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:31:34 its quite a simple contraption
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:31:40 its just hella annoying
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:31:59 and i feel like massaging everyone who uses it with sandpaper covered with razor blades
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:32:09 but otherwise its quite simple
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:32:52 Contraption
1. Door flings open
2. Rocket Engines launch spring-connected slab with chair
3. Player gets on chair
4. Spring launches door back
5. Door closes
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:34:14 lemme get in game
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:34:17 whats ur roblox name
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:35:29 noice jet
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:36:46 well that alexey guy isnt in game
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:36:51 <@!704647634685657090> you wanna get in game?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:36:57 you arent on plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:37:09 ill join you
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:40:06 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:40:21 ridin' on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:40:21 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:40:28 i cant help you then
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:41:56 thats not my plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:42:03 im riding on someone else's plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:42:24 apparently physics gets very buggy
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:42:27 im on the wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:42:47 ~~imagine buying gravity slider~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:42:49 its good
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:51:22 mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:51:30 should be door to conceal kidnapping device
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:51:41 suspension and thrust to propell and send back
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:51:55 also pls dont use it on another person
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:51:59 its super annoying
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:52:52 free length is your range of kidnapping
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:53:04 i'd set it to 10 since they're no setbacks i think
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:58:08 simple prototype
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:58:41 door open
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 09:59:18 kidnapping vehicle extended
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 10:00:15 reset to default and then close the door back
