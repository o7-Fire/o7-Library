plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:32:13 I can't keep trying
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:32:21 because every last one of you says the same line
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:32:23 "get good"
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:32:45 but getting good is impossible if people don't tell you how to get good
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:32:46 wow
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:33:44 ok

plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:34:42 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:36:01 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:36:22 what is the difference between the "no windscreen" and the "yes windscreen" at 0:45
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:37:16 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:37:25 what does that wedge that blocks your vision do
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:38:06 ???
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:38:18 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:38:22 JJNB1ItsMe
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:55:07 you lectured me for like half an hour about how trash I am and how I need to get good
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:55:18 only to say "wow im stupid" and leave
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:56:33 ?
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:56:51 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:57:29 uhh
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:57:35 I don't think you're a good student either
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:58:09 judging from your attitude the whole time
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:58:22 it seemed like you could just pull off a frame in like 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:58:26 with no struggle or thinking
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:58:48 then
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:58:58 whats the problem
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:59:38 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:59:46 prepared your tutorial now?
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 05:59:47 hehe
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:48:59 I will kill your entire family for that beginner nose and cockpit
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:53:12 ? I thought when you see someone have a build without atleast one motor lock (that isn't exposed) and have whatever other weird problems that this server dislikes for some reason, you have to trace their ips and murder their families, I thought that's the tradition here.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:03:41 No, the tradition here is to be as robotic as possible and have every building niche in your build, kind of just making the same build over and over that other people have built over and over in the past too, and if you break off that very specific robotic pattern you get sentenced to the shadow realm or something because this server is just george orwell's 1984 camoflauged, everywhere you look and go there will always be the giant red poster, with the plane crazy logo and the caption below it "SKILL ISSUE IS WATCHING", and the thought police, always reading your mind, guarding your thoughts, making sure you don't even think about breaking out of the dystopian, arid wasteland of these repetitive builds.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:06:58 why do one block wide builds get downvoted???? this is what I'm talking about, they break people up with this bull[REDACTED], removing all originality and style, I'm telling you this is just f***ing 1984
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:09:05 what do you mean? btw <@939960830181642330> do those trails appear in game too or is it edited
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:11:20 nice
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:23:03 I wanna build a new plane but I want it to be 1 block but it's gonna get downvoted üò≠
I don't want to live in this fucking 1984 world üò≠üò≠
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:38:09 why
creations-chat 2022-11-20 12:43:29 wtf even is roscale? also I want to make 1 wide because the regular 2 wide yields the same shape over and over and it is so boring
the-dump 2022-11-20 12:44:24 
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:36:03 ok? and why does that get upvoted?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:38:15 what the hell is J
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:40:30 that is impossible because the people of this server are incredibly unpredictable and you can't tell what plane they'll like the looks of
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:43:42 does mig 27 look good one wide
and bruh I put alot of details on my planes
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:46:48 why should I not be?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:48:53 dude I wanna get upvotes though
creations-chat 2022-11-20 13:54:46 
creations-chat 2022-11-20 14:00:22 uh oh

plane-crazy 2022-12-08 06:33:57 <@907408760253857812> I found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blg464mk0Lw
which is the same thing you told me to do but I am pretty sure it only works when it's pointed up so it won't work for me.
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 06:34:25 really?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 06:34:33 why did it glitch out and make everything explode then
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 06:35:23 hhh
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 07:18:41 unifinished and not to scale baikonur cosmodrone, also not sure if it's even realistic, anyways what do you think so far?
(also there will be a soyuz rocket)
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:01:37 What do you think? rating out of 10?
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:03:58 800 max speed, turns on a dime and pretty stable
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:07:51 me too
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:07:53 but then
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:08:00 if I make it different by making it one wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:08:04 then that's the problem
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:08:30 and not just by making it one wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:08:31 ANYTHING
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:08:57 HOW DO PEOPLE EVEN GET UPVOTES

plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:34:39 <@914605911744593930>
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:35:27 the shape is literally impossible to recreate
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:35:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:35:40 with angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:36:29 how is it disproportianote
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:37:04 <@914605911744593930>

plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:41:23 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:41:30 it looks disproportionate
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:42:25 I made that a long time ago
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:43:07 this is my most recent plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:44:08 
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:44:29 what
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:45:10 what the hell

plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:46:39 wdym "it was just"
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:47:48 I know what an intake is :)
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:11 how do you fix the nose
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:23 it needs 1x2 pyramid wedge
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:29 that's the big problem with this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:38 it's missing the 1x2 pyramid
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:59 cylinders??
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:50:16 I have an old radio from the 60's that turned yellow because of light and it looks really similar to that lmfao
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:50:51 whats wrong with shaders

plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:51:21 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:53:07 Ima quit this game
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:53:29 normally I'd only quit the community
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:55:41 but the community has just given me so many bad experiences and memories that it has tainted my experience with the game too
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:56:12 they want everything to be stud perfect, blueprint accurate and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:56:15 it's a lego game
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:56:18 god
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:56:29 you dont have to always be realistic
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:56:53 I know
