The Tale of ems (723260585361539072)
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:29:11 this took me like 3 hours 
~~helpme~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:30:23 i've done an assault rifle, but that was my first time building a gun so it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:30:36 but i *did* make an lmg conversion for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:31:41 yeah ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:31:48 it's reaally tiny compared to my barret
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:32:10 also the barrel is short as hell cause i didn't know how to fold great when i made it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:32:28 hence the hole in the side
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:32:45 the
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:00:21 rough layout of a deagle i'm making
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:20:15 sadly, no
1. I could try making a bipod later on
2. couldn't figure out how to make a scope, but I could always try tonight
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:22:17 I haven't figured out how to make it shoot either, plus the barrel can't exactly have anything moving down it, as it's a single filled in cylinder 
on top of that, there isn't much space to work with in the muzzle brake
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:24:17 anyways, i'm going to work an an AA12 now :')
creations-chat 2020-11-09 00:25:51 orrr I could work on a different gun, if you have any suggestions?

bet
creations-chat 2021-06-19 04:32:15 oh so that's why I always see jets getting mass downvoted? they're just not as good as others?

creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:24:57 i would, but I decided to install a motor under it so it would be able to spin if I was stuck in a difficult spot
I might make an alternative version with tape, though
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 05:01:29 does anyone know if shredder bugs work without the actual shredder bit? i've always wanted to make one since i don't have anything that's very manuverable but I literally never go into pvp and I want to know beforehand if it'll still work
