plane-crazy 2020-12-27 17:33:37 Ouch.
bug-reports 2020-12-28 01:36:31 I JUST WANT TO MAKE MY ROCKET NOT TIP OVER!!!
bug-reports 2020-12-28 01:37:05 I keep putting in 0.29 but it says 0.28
bug-reports 2020-12-28 05:32:12 Well coincidentally .29 is the number I need to stabilize the rocket. Plane crazy hates me and I don’t know why.
bug-reports 2020-12-28 05:32:49 Okay thanks for the advice
bug-reports 2020-12-28 21:15:47 Okay, why is it that EVERY time I load in the SAME rocket the damn ballasts decide they don’t give a shit about stabilizing my rocket?!
bug-reports 2020-12-28 21:51:01 I’m saying that when i configure a ballets to make my rocket not tip over when I load it back in it the rocket tips over
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 12:25:44 does anyone know why every time I make a rocket or submarine it always doesn't balance even when I follow a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 14:17:54 can anyone tell me why every time I make a submarine or rocket, even if I follow a tutorial they never balance? like, they always tip to the side
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 18:20:23 has anyone else tried to land their starship and have it launched to the 4th dimension?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:58:13 anyone have any advice on how to make planes? because I literally build everything but planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:58:50 no but designing them
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:59:10 If I try to make one its just a remix of the tutorial

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:10:51 my rockets take too long to launch so they get destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:11:49 but the rockets aren't made to land on rough terrain
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:12:30 and that's how the Britannic sank..
