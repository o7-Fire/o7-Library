plane-crazy 2021-03-23 17:20:21 but they are too powerfull and fast

plane-crazy 2021-03-23 17:21:17 oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 17:23:15 ill rather not use hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 17:23:25 (unless its a sci-fi creation)

plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:25:57 i have an idea for plane crazy but it probably wont be added
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:26:33 survival gamemode
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:26:51 thats not what i meant
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:27:03 but you can probably see why it wont be added
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:29:11 by the way guys
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:29:48 do you have anny ideas for plane crazy survival if its gonna be added (high chance it wont be added ;C)
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:30:22 lemme check in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 19:36:03 i cant find the suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:58:31 the roblox bloxy's awards is about to start guys
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:58:42 2 mins

plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:59:11 but its up again
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:59:34 here
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 09:19:19 i wish you could let people use your creation ;C
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 09:19:37 but the game is hardcoded
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 09:20:04 whitelist might be added in the future (probably not this year or next year)
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 09:20:18 (cuz game is hardcoded)
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 09:22:08 soft code?
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:35:47 i have a question
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:36:05 can you escape the chamber?
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:36:29 you need to prove it tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:37:06 you can only bring yourself inside (plus others)
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:37:57 thats cheating tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:38:06 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:38:09 theres a door
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:38:34 heres the door
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:40:01 thats also cheating + then you lose the challenge cause you die
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:40:15 and the door has locked setting enabled
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:40:35 i dont think that glitch will work
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:40:55 the chamber is ancored
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:41:14 i know
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:41:18 but its ancored
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:42:29 
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:42:49 okay then
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:43:47 thats also cheating..
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:44:46 heres the chamber
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:46:57 but dont you also need to press the fire button?
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:14 add helium to top or stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:20 or make it wider
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:32 HAAAAAAAAAACKS
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:44 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:58 yesh
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:19 cameras are also invisible blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:50 helium blocks gud
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:57 (sometimes)
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:51:47 .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:51:51 rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:52:01 april 1st there was a plane crazy event

plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:52:36 unless ya wanna make it mini
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:58:56 the real heavy is Balast Blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 15:36:40 i dont think you can make 1:1 scale cause roblox figures arent the same size as humans
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 15:37:06 were Litteraly action figures or something like that
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 15:38:15 but if its for roblox figures then you probably can
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 15:39:41 okay
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:46:06 i just got an idea for plane crazy but it probably wont be added
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:46:23 its a turret
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:46:59 a turret that automaticaly aims at enemies and shoot (but it turns slow)
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:47:32 how?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:47:51 but what if your in the sky?
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 16:48:43 no answer i guess...

plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:24:41 like why do they even exist
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:25:06 i know but why did they get invented

plane-crazy 2021-06-06 18:40:07 its litteraly Dotcom65 but you cant search for it idk why

general 2021-06-10 15:49:55 how?
general 2021-06-10 15:50:15 uhhhm
general 2021-06-10 15:50:20 what?
general 2021-06-10 15:50:47 also you can use portals for submarines
general 2021-06-10 15:51:17 cause if you dont want water in your submarine then you can use portals
general 2021-06-10 15:51:32 to make a clone of the submarine
general 2021-06-10 15:51:42 thats just your opinion
general 2021-06-10 15:52:29 what
general 2021-06-10 15:52:46 hmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 15:56:11 this game should have portal blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 16:13:46 lets just stop this lol

general 2021-10-04 12:39:35 i dont see plane crazy 2 in there
general 2021-10-04 12:39:55 lol
general 2021-10-04 12:40:51 isnt there a channel here where you ask the devs questions?

help 2021-10-05 17:23:49 since the landing gear we have rn in pc1 is bouncy when you land i was thinking maybe they'd add suspension to the landing gear in pc2?
help 2021-10-05 17:27:01 i know you can put suspensions on the landing gear or make custom landing gear but having landing gear in pc2 with suspension can save some of your space
help 2021-10-05 17:27:18 and be usefull
help 2021-10-06 19:04:54 i wonder if pc2 will have vr ***btw i dont think that they will add vr to pc2, since idk if they can find a way to pilot crafts in vr, so this is a dumb question, i know***
help 2021-10-06 19:11:43 ***and also im talking about full vr support***
