bug-reports 2020-12-14 22:48:16 Its not really a glitch, it’s because the suspension is wanting to push upwards, since that is happening you are being pushed up as well. Meaning that the suspension is pushing you up while you push up the suspension.

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 21:08:06 Ball shredder: the outer shell or ball protects the insides of the shredder which also acts as a weapon. Being covered with a lot of cutters. The middle or core is a turret with rockets to move the ball. 

The idea of how this works is to ram at targets and deal damage with the ball cutters and core turret.
