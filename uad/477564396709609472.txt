plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:51:29 I'd like to ask out of the blue, how can I obtain image permissions?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:52:13 Only level three, hm?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:52:26 Well that's doable for sure.
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:52:51 **casually reads terms and conditions**
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:53:43 There is a special hell for people like you if you read the full list of terms and conditions, that is just pure evil.
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:54:18 See, I work as a salesman so I hate it when people read fine print.
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:57:21 Would any of you like me to DM you a mysterious image?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:57:28 I know you're curious
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 09:57:48 Gotta find out
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 10:08:32 I have a fully working spamton NEO
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 10:08:59 It has a pipis launcher
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 10:09:03 That shoots TNT balls
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 10:11:28 No, only 452 liked it.
general 2022-06-24 02:26:50 I uh, I have a complaint
general 2022-06-24 02:27:08 Just lost hours of progress on a 20 thousand block build and I'm just casually wondering what the heck happened
help 2022-06-24 02:33:19 Anyone think they have a solution? I added over a thousand new blocks to a massive 19k block build (making it 20k blocks) and when I rejoined, all new backup saves and progress through the entirety of the day has been completely wiped. I cannot find a way to recover this, is there a solution?
help 2022-06-24 02:36:20 One way or another, I'm getting that back
help 2022-06-24 02:37:44 If someone has something of any sort, please let me know, these were important changes
