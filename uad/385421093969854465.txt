creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:02:26 im having troubles making rotors working correctly, because, im using hovers to lift and the thing, is that this working only on single rotored helis, not on a chinook, because the hovers cant be assigned to focus on only some lose parts, they push everythings, like ; my frontrotor's hovers are pushing the blades of the backrotor, thats the big problem

am i forced to use rocket lifting for this?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:04:37 ??
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:07:48 rockets looks garbage on blades :/

creations-chat 2022-03-13 10:36:35 I always see people making steam train valves with 3x3 cylinders so of course its easy, but roscale trains are mostly made with 2x2 cylinders and people dont bother making working valves for that size so i did
Also i can remove that space between wheels and valves, i just tought it would look better this way.
