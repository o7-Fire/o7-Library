The Tale of delta4162 (569554450616942618)
creations-chat 2020-11-13 01:34:05 hah I made it when I was like 8 those were literally the first 3 words to come to the mind of an 8 year old apparently
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 02:56:35 hah, I was experimenting with things and somehow made this:
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 03:12:04 And this fellas, is what happens when you activate your parachute at 50,000 speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 03:13:07 ;-;
creations-chat 2020-11-14 07:15:48 <@!757839647496994837> That's a good idea and well executed (In my opinion)
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:07:50 b r u h I'm doing the challenge where you have to propulsively land 3 stages of a rocket, and came across a glitch that literally teleports the stages down to the ground, and there's no way around it with my design so I have to restart...yay
bug-reports 2020-11-14 09:12:58 I'm doing the challenge where you have to land 3 stages of a rocket, and I came across an interesting glitch: I have my stages connected via magnets and when the magnets are connected and I activate an anchor block on the top stage, deactivate the magnet (With the anchor block still on), and then turn the anchor block off, the stage that was disconnected will instantly teleport straight to the ground instead of falling. Idk if this is already a known issue but I figured I'd let whoever reads these know anyway just in case.
bug-reports 2020-11-14 16:18:13 Yeah <@!403843930543882241> the system I was planning on using to disconnect them wasn't going to fit in my design so I had to go with magnets, I'll have to redesign it so it will fit
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:10:49 <@!683847069890510887> It says above the picture that it's not done yet, and I can't speak for anyone else but I generally don't paint 'till the end
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:44:09 <@!651361636657135617> It's probably your rotor spinning and making the entire helicopter turn a little with it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:44:25 Jeez I'm struggling to make the nose of a b17 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:55:33 I keep ending up with this when I'm trying to thicken my fuselage, the wedges look awful next to the part in front. Any ideas on how to transition better? (Trying to make a b17)
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:59:00 I mean.. if you had to have them in the first place maybe you should make a new one if it can't fly without them, you kinda need a working vtol to get the rank lul
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:59:54 Well, good luck finding them in that case
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:00:24 Anyway I'm guessing nobody has any ideas on how to make the nose of my b17 not look trash
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:00:59 I...I am
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:03:46 You probably put them either on the front or the back so try looking there more carefully
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:03:54 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:04:08 Good luck with your application
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:53:03 Hm I seem to have resolved the issue by adding round wedges there for intakes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:53:06 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:07:02 lol I downvoted it because you're advertising it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:10:25 When did he advertise it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:10:58 like 15 messages above this
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:11:04 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:12:19 He was asking for upvotes, in my opinion if something is a day old and nobody else is upvoting it, it's done and you shouldn't keep asking for more
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:12:27 Just my opinion, but that's why I downvoted it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:13:27 upgrades?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:14:33 either way it's only my opinion I'm not telling you to downvote it, I'm only telling you why I downvoted it myself
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:16:01 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:18:24 Yeah I've had a request open for 3 hours lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:19:09 Because most people are on earlier
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:19:24 So there's not much point
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:26:25 LOL My B17 is slowly turning into a 747
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:30:22 lol I've looked a pictures it doesn't look to different
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:30:35 I think it's the tinted glass + the half block at the top
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:30:45 I think I'll use disconnectors for the roof
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 07:55:03 +externally
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:05:53 That is in fact the reason I downvoted
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:26:44 <@!743010779229454346> Just curious as to why you downvoted my plane, not asking you to change it just want to know so I can change it on the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:28:44 Oof, well... I mean if that's the only reason you downvoted consider at least removing it I'm trying to get Aero engineer 5 ;-; Thanks üôÇ
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:30:58 Thanks, I think it may be the angle it's almost 2 plots long lol. Maybe I'll make it 1.5 blocks thick instead of 2.5
creations-chat 2020-11-17 05:54:16 <@456226577798135808> Nice landing gear on that 767

creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:51:13 <@456226577798135808> You would have my upvote if it weren't for the rockets on the wings

creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:47:17 You can make larger custom wheels <@!293301655464574986>
creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:51:29 <@!293301655464574986> Go into into the top tab of the build menu, then scroll down to "Cylinders" if I were you I'd probably either use "Cylinder 2 2x2" or "Cylinder 3x3" there are a other options you could go with as well
creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:53:39 <@!293301655464574986> Connect them to motors
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:05:54 lol you probably didn't do it right
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:12:34 Try making it shorter I think it'll look better then
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:26:55 Hm that's a good point got my downvote for that lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:28:44 Oh yeah it's even the same picture : O so it's not even a progress update or anything lol. I mean the only reason would be to get more upvotes... but you're not gonna get more upvotes at this time of night lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 07:32:12 It's to long anyway you need to shorten it and add more wedges in the front

creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:49:58 You could try adding treads (I don't make tanks though so I don't know if that would be possible)
creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:52:03 <@!746022074216218625> A downvote for the repost, and a mental downvote for the wheels

creations-chat 2020-11-18 20:59:10 <@!746022074216218625> you've literally posted the same creation 3 times lol, no wonder you don't have the "I read the rules" role : O
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:00:45 yeah but you're just posting it over and over again trying to get more likes
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:02:38 lol must be glitched then <@!719168864705052802> you don't have it either, I got it when I clicked on it I don't remember when that was
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:04:21 they must've just removed the role entirely ig, I meant they removed it from everyone else, or the bot is bugged idk
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:32:49 <@!746022074216218625> isn't that a default tutorial plane lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:34:20 hm to me it looked like a tutorial plane with pvp weapons lol maybe I'm blind
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:42:27 lol the only thing I don't like about that C17 is the gap between the wings and the fuselage ;-;
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:45:17 <@!721734392971526164> Self upvotes don't count fyi
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:47:27 I downvoted it because the outside looks kind of bland in my opinion, but yeah everyone likes it, or everyone dislikes it for some reason lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:49:15 What's with all the tutorials in creations today lol
creations-chat 2020-11-18 21:58:15 thicc boi

creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:14:42 <@!566765848354750514> What are its dimensions?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:22:37 3 Days playing the game or 3 days  on the discord.. I got expert on my first day on the discord : P
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:25:34 I've never actually built a presentable robot before lol, probably my next project after a carrier I'm working on
creations-chat 2020-11-18 22:28:07 <@!489910972946055172> Can't say for sure, but I have a feeling it's fine that he posted his friend's creation as long as his friend wanted him to which he did apparently
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:05:47 I like the intakes, but I'm pretty sure the f35's wings are bigger... also on the real F35 they are intakes and not for missiles
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:07:18 I think the wings are also bigger on an F22 : P ye the wings start further up on the plane, it would probably show it better from a side view
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:09:08 Yeah because it's a WIP lol Read <#533294912586645521> ... not telling you to remove it just saying that's why I downvoted it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:12:09 
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:15:22 lol yeah self upvotes don't even count
creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:16:53 Nice cursor <@!716121757131735101>

creations-chat 2020-11-18 23:49:48 Isn't it kinda short height wise? Yeah ^
creations-chat 2020-11-19 00:17:45 <@456226577798135808> It goes side to side because when the other leg lifts up it tilts to that side, and there must be more weight in the front than in the back so it makes it do that
bot-central 2020-11-19 00:48:22 !servers
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:42:21 Then you probably didn't save it, you sure nothing happens when you press load on the save slot? (even if it didn't show your saved version when you joined)
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:46:14 Maybe you saved the the wrong slot? Or clicked load instead of save maybe.. Idk it could be a bug but it's never happened to me and I've never heard of it happening to anyone else. Anyway I gtg for a bit have a good night :/ sorry, good luck though

creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:28:31 I mean you didn't show the interior, but you said the interior was completed so it's basically the same. lol just admit it, it's a repost
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:35:00 It's a wip
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:38:56 tbh I downvote all wips just because they're wips lol, I agree with vipEmpire : P

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 05:03:33 Lol this guy comes up to me and my build which is intentionally an octagon, and starts trying to criticize me on how it wasn't a circle. Then I proceed to end this dude's career in the form of roasts... he left shortly after, the end.

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 02:33:23 bruh I was glitched in the build menu where it would have 2 blocks selected and try to place 2 as well, same went for the delete menu... guess what happened...I deleted most of the complicated part of my build
