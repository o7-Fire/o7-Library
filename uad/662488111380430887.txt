general 2020-06-24 15:28:49 pvp
general 2020-06-24 15:29:04 it makes pee
general 2020-06-24 15:29:06 why
general 2020-06-24 15:29:15 so its useless?
general 2020-06-24 15:29:27 well lava spitter is basically acid
general 2020-06-24 15:29:34 u cant?
general 2020-06-24 15:29:40 what
general 2020-06-24 15:29:58 we need t o r p e d o s
general 2020-06-24 15:30:59 we need tsar bomba: it can be placed 1 time and when activated it wipes out the whole server and you just fall instantly when you respawn and then everybody has to leave and its completely free to use
general 2020-06-24 15:31:17 they should add torpedos
general 2020-06-24 15:31:36 /they drop but stop dropping when they hit water and continue in teh same path for a long time
general 2020-06-24 15:32:31 cause its to space consuming and difficult to make a good torpedo that doesnt require manual control out of rockets and explosives and stuff
general 2020-06-24 15:33:01 what do u mean?
general 2020-06-24 15:33:26 jake thats not how it works...
general 2020-06-24 15:34:02 since we can see that there is still air itself that means that fluids such as air or helium would still be normal
general 2020-06-24 15:34:24 and then since helium is less dense than air it would still go up
general 2020-06-24 15:34:32 so yess
general 2020-06-24 15:34:40 helium would work in 0g
general 2020-06-24 15:35:20 shut up jake nobodys cares stop critisizing JAKE

general 2021-01-19 02:55:38 Ive found a cool trick I dont know if other people know, but ive never seen it mentioned or used. Basically, you know when you try to configure a camera and it points at the block you click afterwards? if you have a block attached to the back and front of the camera, then point the camera somewhere, upon spawning in the blocks attached to the camera teleport and are locked to that location, so I think this could be used to for complex folding creations and you dont have to put ugly motors everywhere, and they are always in the perfect place.
general 2021-01-19 02:56:12 never seen it used
general 2021-01-19 02:56:27 I dont know i live under a rock

general 2021-03-10 03:33:20 I would LOVE some sort of system designed to report builds like shredderbugs etc, where there could be an automated system to detect shredderbugs by comparing it to tutorials online. ya know?
general 2021-03-10 03:33:50 OR, if theres other shredderbugs, you could have some sort of person that just looks at reported builds
general 2021-03-10 03:33:55 just saying
general 2021-03-10 03:33:58 that would be sweet
general 2021-03-10 03:34:31 atleas comparing it to tutorials would be nice, and once you do it, you are banned from using cutters for a while or something
general 2021-03-10 03:34:54 OR, just a PVP mode without shredders

the-dump 2021-05-14 14:34:17 im feeling like a 9 today
the-dump 2021-05-14 14:59:06 no, 7,(ball turret gunner) is the position with the highest fatality rate. if the planes going down, it can take far to long for the gunner to get out, and if your plane is going down,then you can expect to become a red jam very soon.
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:00:58 no
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:01:01 ball turret gunner
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:01:11 you get shot and become a red jam when the plane goes down
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:01:25 yeah
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:01:38 and it can take a few minutes to even get OUT of the plane
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:01:44 yeah no
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:02:17 the ball turret has to be in a specific position and takes FOREVER to get out, and you dont even have a parachute IN the turret
the-dump 2021-05-14 15:02:44 ball turret gunner has the biggest fatality rate

help 2021-12-07 23:36:16 mini lag machine, those seats with the rockets on them that shoot you off the map or a "kidnap device" those big groups of circles with the turrets that make like an army and they follow your cursor
help 2021-12-07 23:36:18 you know
help 2021-12-07 23:37:05 I think so
help 2021-12-07 23:37:09 you know its like
help 2021-12-07 23:37:11 a circle
help 2021-12-07 23:37:20 then theres a motor 2 in the center
help 2021-12-07 23:37:23 a block on that
help 2021-12-07 23:37:36 and a propellor on the back of the blocks
help 2021-12-07 23:37:43 then they attach a gun or rocket
help 2021-12-07 23:37:49 or cutters

help 2021-12-07 23:39:06 or that scene in harry potter 2
help 2021-12-07 23:39:11 the chamber
help 2021-12-07 23:41:25 watch fireyoblivions video on angle locking
help 2021-12-07 23:41:34 I think that'll show how
help 2021-12-07 23:41:59 you don't need THAT many  springs, I think
help 2021-12-07 23:44:36 add a robot face onto the robot
help 2021-12-07 23:44:40 like an emoji
help 2021-12-07 23:45:08 ðŸ¤–
help 2021-12-07 23:45:18 yeah
help 2021-12-07 23:46:24 ,aybe
help 2021-12-07 23:46:29 you could add a second arm
help 2021-12-07 23:46:42 and then a cutter on top to be a head
help 2021-12-07 23:46:51 and then ut the emji THERE
help 2021-12-07 23:47:20 one of those magnetic cutter shooters, perhaps?
help 2021-12-07 23:49:58 there is a youtube video by a person named fireoblivion, where he goes over how to make that not happen during anglelocking.
help 2021-12-07 23:51:26 no, its looks more like a tube
help 2021-12-07 23:51:35 and then cutters are jammed into one side
help 2021-12-07 23:51:57 and then magnets just yeet them out to make the only actually decent AA weapon in the game
help 2021-12-07 23:52:16 but a terror for ground vehicles that are blacklisted
help 2021-12-07 23:52:32 quite the annoyance unless used for AA like  think it should be used for
help 2021-12-07 23:52:45 but yeah
help 2021-12-07 23:52:57 its basically just a cannon in real life, but...
help 2021-12-07 23:53:06 it has a LOT of magnets at teh back
help 2021-12-07 23:53:12 and its a block
help 2021-12-07 23:53:18 yeah thats what I said at first
help 2021-12-07 23:53:26 make a smol version
help 2021-12-07 23:53:47 4 block long barrel made of half blocks
help 2021-12-07 23:53:52 it doesn't need to shoot
help 2021-12-07 23:54:11 and add a informational section next to everything
help 2021-12-07 23:55:08 such as "the cutter first started appearing around xx/xx/xx, but boomed in popularity a few months later. After that, it evolved into the next attraction, the shredder ball."
help 2021-12-07 23:55:22 yeah TNT ball
help 2021-12-07 23:55:26 and it will work!
help 2021-12-07 23:55:36 just make sure it doesn't explode
help 2021-12-07 23:56:57 ping once your done with that
help 2021-12-07 23:58:09 ok
help 2021-12-07 23:58:14 put it on a turret
help 2021-12-07 23:58:22 and use half blocks
help 2021-12-07 23:58:45 you can so it easily without changing the dimensions wit half blocks
help 2021-12-08 00:00:41 replace all the full blocksin that building with half blocks and half wedges
help 2021-12-08 00:01:03 there are 2 half wedges, one in the s=wedges category and one in the halfblock category
help 2021-12-08 00:01:16 choose the one in the halfblock category
help 2021-12-08 00:02:08 I think you should make it so everything in the museum  turns a bit
help 2021-12-08 00:02:31 like the robot, you press a key and the gun points upwards an left at a 45 degree angle
help 2021-12-08 00:02:35 it would be easy to do
help 2021-12-08 00:02:45 and looks extra good.
help 2021-12-08 00:02:54 wouldn't be hard
help 2021-12-08 00:03:07 not all the builds, just the ones that have motors in them naturally
help 2021-12-08 00:03:13 maybe not the shredder
help 2021-12-08 00:03:50 just sayin, it would add some extra 
flare to your build
help 2021-12-08 00:04:27 im not saying they would KEEP moving
help 2021-12-08 00:04:35 they would move to a certain position and stay put
help 2021-12-08 00:05:16 they would move, but only after you press a button. after that, they stay in their "showcase" position
help 2021-12-08 00:05:49 yeah the moving parts like the turret of a cannon would point at an angle when you spawned it in
help 2021-12-08 00:06:02 but it would stay pointed at that same angle
help 2021-12-08 00:06:26 imma brb, din din time
help 2021-12-08 00:06:31 good luck!
help 2021-12-08 00:22:50 I am back
