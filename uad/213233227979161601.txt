creations-chat 2020-03-17 09:27:30 `there can only be one Mihaly`

Sukhoi Su-30SM in Ace Combat 7's Sol Squadron camo, 525 blocks

complete with the usual things in my Sukhoi builds and a few new ones:
- retracting landing gears
- 3D thrust vectoring
- operational ailerons, canards and elevators
- took it a step further and gave it operational rudders (which can act as airbrakes too)
- seating for 2 (enter from the bottom of fuselage)

things omitted from actual Su-30SM:
- dorsal airbrakes (it slows the plane down in flight)

creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:14:53 ok I feel like mihaly's livery is starting to be overdone
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:09 also, that's not even mihaly
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:15 mihaly's tail is orange
creations-chat 2020-03-18 10:15:32 so therefore it makes me the true Mihaly

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:47:36 is it possible to spawn multiple builds at once in vip severs?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:47:43 I've seen some people do it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:48:18 icic
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:48:42 that would mean having the alt run on another device, right?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:49:17 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:49:25 too troublesome
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 14:49:27 rip me
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 12:32:18 damn boi, that's massive
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 12:50:34 well boys, we did it
the supercarrier is no more
creations-chat 2020-03-27 10:53:40 if he doesn't use a control surface, the ailerons won't function
creations-chat 2020-03-27 10:54:04 cus if he used panels, it will stick to the other wing panels
creations-chat 2020-03-28 15:22:46 ooooooo
creations-chat 2020-03-28 15:22:59 that looks simple but somewhat unique
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:46:09 has anyone made an F-15 with a variable intake?
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:46:15 cus i tried
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:47:44 and the scary thing is that she's the largest fighter i've built to date
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:12 he wide
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 11:02:16 but snazzy

creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:34:32 <@393679134779375616> I'd make the tail about 1 or two blocks longer. the distance between the end of the main wing and tail wing is a bit longer when I look at the blueprints
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:34:46 but apart from that, in  terms of how it looks, it's really good!
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:36:45 I'll be honest, I'm not sure what you're trying to go for <:GWjiangoOmegaLUL:389904150886088723>
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:36:56 but it looks like a Typhoon?
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:37:41 icic
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:38:28 I'd make the vertical stabiliser bigger, it's absurdly disproportionate to the main wing imo
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:38:39 at least from the camera angle you've given
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:39:34 also, try to put the rear landing gears wider apart, you're going to have some slight instability issues if you plan to move the plane around on the ground
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:39:44 > so make the rudder bigger?
yeah, essentially that
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:40:16 np
creations-chat 2020-05-25 03:40:44 aye np
creations-chat 2020-05-25 05:30:47 ooo, that's really neat

creations-chat 2020-06-04 02:29:26 super simple
creations-chat 2020-06-04 02:29:46 just make sure the larger control surfaces dont touch the the mainwing other than the motor 2s

help 2020-06-04 14:09:36 i think he meant the ballasts
help 2020-06-04 14:48:04 <@665957175515938837> whichever you're more comfortable with. however your plane will move more realistically if you use a keyboard with "custom" control surfaces
help 2020-06-04 14:48:23 i.e motor 2 controlled ailerons, flaps, rudder, elevators

help 2020-06-05 16:09:21 i guess a quick fix for the time beind is to somehow add more lift at the front

help 2020-06-05 16:10:50 replace the front of the intake with normal delta wing panels
help 2020-06-05 16:11:04 and try topracer's advice too
help 2020-06-05 16:13:15 you can make it more flush with the design, but otherwise, you've got the idea
help 2020-06-05 16:15:03 there's only one way to tell and that's to test it
help 2020-06-05 16:15:12 it wont eradicate the issue completely tho

plane-crazy 2020-06-09 05:49:42 the vertical stabliser will be a huge issue tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 05:52:03 > you can use motor locking to move the vertical stabilizer to the correct position
that's one of the solutions in thinking of

creations-chat 2020-06-17 03:40:31 im getting 503
help 2020-06-17 04:54:39 most likely the torque from the propellor
help 2020-06-17 04:54:58 is there a way to counter it? not sure myself
help 2020-06-17 04:55:21 can you screenshot the whole build?
help 2020-06-17 04:56:26 im not sure if the problem still exists, but whenever i spawn in the airport and my build has the standard control surfaces, they will never respond accordingly
help 2020-06-17 04:57:03 if you've spawned from the airport, that *might* be the issue. otherwise, if it's design related, we'll have to see the whole build
help 2020-06-17 04:59:28 how about in build mode?
help 2020-06-17 04:59:37 and a little closer please
help 2020-06-17 05:05:22 <@!607098626153644032> check all your control surfaces and see if they're all set to automatic. that means it will follow your mouse
help 2020-06-17 05:05:54 otherwise, there's literally no other factors causing your plane to roll to the left other than the torque from your engine
help 2020-06-17 05:06:50 i also have this issue on my Zero but since i use keyboard controls and motor-powered control surfaces, it's easier to counter

help 2020-06-29 02:34:15 I don't think it'll explode mid air
help 2020-06-29 02:34:22 very likely
help 2020-06-29 02:34:41 I haven't made cannons like those tho, so I'm not too sure
help 2020-06-29 02:36:00 that could work, but that would also mean that you'll have to set seperate keybinds to every TNT ball

creations-chat 2020-08-23 13:24:17 instead of using full blocks in the centre, consider using half blocks/wedges
creations-chat 2020-08-23 13:24:31 you'll give the engine more depth

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:14:35 this is painful
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:15:08 girls: you dont understand pain
me:
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 01:23:58 take a shot of water everytime you see a tutorial f22
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:17:28 im not sure about you guys, but the F/A-18s are pretty tricky to build
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:17:36 like, look at that
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:14 everything about this glorified F-5's proportion is whack
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:38 > I'm losing speed when I adjust pitch
your wing panels will rotate against the direction you're travelling in, causing drag
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:44 hence, slowing you down
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:59 you can use this knowledge to create spoilers
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:19:20 it pretty normal
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:19:43 if you can get your plane to pitch up quick enough, it's possible
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:20:16 not sure if giving your plane TVC would help in PC, but it's nice having them
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:25:03 not the best example, but i built my Su-30SM with """"3D"""" TVC
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:25:22 it's possible and the mechanism is simple
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:25:24 w-what
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:25:36 stop, you're gonna throw yourself into the backrooms

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:03:35 lockheed partnered with yakovlev in the research for the yak-38's successor
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:03:44 and they used that information to build the F-35B

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:21:19 i'm trying out a different building style for this
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:42:47 E/A-18G lookin promising
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:43:04 yes, with the power of american oil and freedom, this growler flies without ailerons
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:45:16 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:47:10 working on three aircrafts at the same time is hard but satisfying

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:11:11 not a huge fan of 3D models, much prefer reference phtos
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:40 the more reference, the better
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:48 just dont confuse different variants of aircrafts
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:15:24 while looking for reference for me hornet, i *somehow* confused the F/A-18D with the F/A-18F
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:15:29 ***somehow***
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:15:55 what i love about the flanker family is that they're all evolutions of each other
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:16:08 it's basically a flying AK
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:17:07 Su-27 = AK-47
Su-30 = AKM
Su-34 = RPK
Su-35 = AK-103

reversed engineering amirite

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:18:08 the type-56
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:18:19 yeah the su47 is a groza

I'm looking, just figuring out how you could make it better
creations-chat 2020-09-21 04:08:54 - instead of having a flat body, give it some varying depth and volume. see the F-15 or the F-16
- instead of using 1x2/1x3 delta panels, use 1x1 delta panels. see the JAS-39 or the AJ-37 for reference

creations-chat 2020-10-26 04:59:37 i personally think it's spot on. flankers' wings tend to look huge until you build the aft section of the aircraft

plane-crazy 2020-10-27 10:59:42 Mirage IV update #2.1: initial intakes are done, might need some revision
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 11:00:18 however, it's possible i might need to do a fold
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 11:00:43 based on the proportions i'm using, i think it's quite inevitable
creations-chat 2020-10-30 00:24:14 <@!588055079899103299> i personally feel like you use use 1x1 deltas for the vertical stabilisers. but understandably, the angle of the leading edge is pretty much in betweem 1x1 and 1x2. otherwise, it looks great already <:GWjiangPepeThumb:407619074466643978>
creations-chat 2020-10-30 00:29:59 i think the real question is if the city names are able to not get yeeted by the roblox filter system
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 00:30:56 its very reminiscent of my first Zero build

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 08:15:52 and here's a comparision to the Tu-95, whose wheels are significantly larger
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 08:16:10 not sure whther to go oversized or undersized

EDIT: got rid of the image with reference picture. it shouldn't be there anyways
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:06:39 > also i seriously doubt its the *first*
in the whole of PC, I'd agree with you. but literally no one has talked about the IV here.
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:06:50 also, my bad for posting 8 images, I won't do it again
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:12:20 <@456226577798135808> nope, it's really t h i c c
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:12:38 that image doesn't really justify how thicc it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:16:24 - larger vert. stabilisers
- place the wings higher
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:16:34 I'll take note of these the next time I build an Mir IV
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:18:44 I think the game is far too hardcoded to do that. even then, I think it's gonna lag too much for it to be feasible
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 13:22:13 btw that's a neat Mirage III (?)

help 2021-06-08 12:14:48 they actually did some motorlocks. but yes, experiment more with it. 

one look and i think you can make the transition from the intakes to the exhaust look more flush with some basic motorlock with disconnectors or tnt

creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:55:45 not sure how you're getting that many downvotes so quickly. i say this is one of the most on-point Felons i've seen on PC to date
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 01:27:01 i'd say the E/F intakes are simpler, since it has 4 distinct sides
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 01:27:16 if they're talking about the C/D variants, ehhh im not sure
creations-chat 2021-07-12 05:51:45 I have a few things to say 

- the extended leading edge should be shifted a little further up the nose
- the elevators can probably be pushed back 1 or 2 blocks
- consider using large rockets/jet engines and motorlock it? (though given the scale i think it's fine as it is
- the shape of the elevators could be tweaked a bit, sweep it back maybe? 

other than that, i think it's a pretty good Super Hornet. kudos on the afterburner! üëå
