general 2021-12-16 05:35:05 i just verified
1 MINUTE AGO
general 2021-12-16 05:35:16 and i join into chat in flames
bot-central 2021-12-16 05:35:38 !help
general 2021-12-16 05:36:13 neat
general 2021-12-16 05:36:31 anyways time to get laughed at by profiessional builders due to my skill issued frigate with turrets
general 2021-12-16 05:36:40 and no i am too lazy to build missiles
general 2021-12-16 05:36:45 its jsut guns n rockets
general 2021-12-16 05:36:53 desptie knowing how to build one and ahving space to
general 2021-12-16 05:37:03 i didnt build a missile on the frigate
general 2021-12-16 05:37:27 also, has anyone built any spaceships based on stuff from EVE online?
general 2021-12-16 05:37:31 genuine question
general 2021-12-16 05:39:28 the first one...
that isnt a ship from eve online i think.
UNLESS ITS THE CALDARI TITAN AND IM JUST DUMB.
Second one is definitely a avatar
a accurate one too,
general 2021-12-16 05:39:43 OH DAMN
thats a very good rifter
general 2021-12-16 05:40:00 it looks so perfect i woudl think its photoshopped but no
general 2021-12-16 05:40:45 that looks worse than my frigate
and that was originally a 1 turreted rustbucket
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:41:30 aight so
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:42:05 sorry if this a stupid question but
HOW DO I MAKE STUFF FLAOT INFINITELY
iVE FOLLOWED 3-10 TUTORIALS
i jsut want to make ships from highfleet ARGHHH
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:42:41 how you not know how to make a star
we have enough types of wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:42:47 yet you neglect to think we cant
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:43:44 very simple answer
oh also how do i make stuff like spaceships or hoverships float and stop while not holding my movement key
this is a genera; question im very confused.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:44:06 also i am trying to make ships from Highfleet
j-just google it
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:44:36 wait literally jsut 1 of thsoe can do that and still allow for flight?
B R U H
ive spent 3 hours researching
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:44:42 and all it takes is  O N  E
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:45:18 so basically turn off anchor while flying?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:45:29 that sounds slightly hard to make but ill try
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:45:39 first ill make a simple hover engine test.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:45:48 and hopefully not make spinning death in the attempt.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:46:17 put a triangle wedge or corner wedge on there
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:46:45 anyways with this new knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:46:58 i shall make the astero-class frigate from eve online
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:47:10 because for some reason ive been thinking fo palying even recently but uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:47:12 its went to crap
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:47:17 so instead i do this
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:48:50 prntscreen screenshot then send it to your own email and download it to the phone
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 05:48:58 overtly complicated way to do this
general 2021-12-16 05:50:07 i diagnose you with down bad
its near christmas
now is not the time to talk about how thicc your sister is, this is not the month to do this.
general 2021-12-16 05:51:04 fun fact you make a full terrain speeder one using hover drives.
why do i tell you this? because i want to see the ppl cry about this.
general 2021-12-16 05:51:34 rickje
general 2021-12-16 05:51:48 what the hell rick
general 2021-12-16 05:53:29 rick this is going into a cursed comment compilation and you already know this
this was cursed.
i am going to go bleach my eyes at r/eyebleach
general 2021-12-16 05:53:57 grab the shotgun.
we ride at dawn
general 2021-12-16 05:54:48 fun fact
ive been targetted by half of a server ocne for killing a very unarmored battleship in a very tiny boat.
general 2021-12-16 05:55:02 I ALSO SOMEHOW W O N  that.
general 2021-12-16 05:55:15 i beat 7 people in my dinky little somali priate boat
general 2021-12-16 05:55:43 this included 1 JET
2-3 BATTLESHIPS
4 PLANES
1 CAR
AND A SHREDDERBUG.
general 2021-12-16 05:56:07 i perfectly timed it.
general 2021-12-16 05:56:17 bruh moment
general 2021-12-16 05:56:42 cringe.
general 2021-12-16 05:56:59 anyways now that im done with school, expect me to learn hwot o build better
general 2021-12-16 05:57:06 and i might actually use motor-locks for once.
general 2021-12-16 05:57:11 never sued them and tis dd
general 2021-12-16 05:57:14 I KNOW THEY WORK.
general 2021-12-16 05:57:44 this is not a joke i got done with my first semester on monday.
general 2021-12-16 05:57:55 its now Wednesday.
general 2021-12-16 05:59:23 aight so
general 2021-12-16 05:59:33 should i build Minmatar ships from eve online?
general 2021-12-16 05:59:45 cause uhh. yeah minmatar ships can be very easily remade ingame
general 2021-12-16 06:00:00 they only use autocannons (guns) and missiles (rockets)
general 2021-12-16 06:00:42 first test of my very bad amount of skill is making the Vakyrie light drone or at elast a droen wither with a turret or atelast one that looks decent.
general 2021-12-16 06:00:55 and when i mean drone i basically mean edited ground missile
general 2021-12-16 06:01:01 with guns and wings.
general 2021-12-16 06:01:27 quieres hot cocoa?
general 2021-12-16 06:02:07 that means do you want hot cocoa
general 2021-12-16 06:02:15 quieres means do you want.
general 2021-12-16 06:02:19 ITS BASIC SPANISH.
general 2021-12-16 06:03:23 i suggest not telling me any ww2 german jokes
i wont explain further
general 2021-12-16 06:03:59 i know how to make drones, they are simple enough.
but i want to make it also be pilotable by players if edited.
general 2021-12-16 06:04:10 hwoever we start tommorow, probablu
general 2021-12-16 06:04:28 gone, reduced to atoms
general 2021-12-16 06:04:54 rick said why
general 2021-12-16 06:05:14 rick was the old owner if im correct or si the current owner
HE NEEDS NOT ELABORATE
general 2021-12-16 06:05:43 do you want hot cocoa rick
general 2021-12-16 06:06:38 i joined like less than an hour ago despite having played the game back in like 2019
general 2021-12-16 06:07:57 rick i asked if you wanted hot chocolate
this is a yes or yes question
general 2021-12-16 06:08:27 consume hot cocoa
general 2021-12-16 06:09:07 can someone use unde on me
general 2021-12-16 06:09:16 cause i wanna see the bots response
general 2021-12-16 06:09:49 thank
general 2021-12-16 06:10:47 put a hover drive on it
general 2021-12-16 06:10:59 VROOOOOM
general 2021-12-16 06:14:31 helo
woudl you like some hot cocoa
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:16:23 if he didnt call that the gjallarhorn ima be upset
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:17:28 anyways thank you for the knowledge on hwo to hover forever using anchor blocks with toggles
 will be sure to make some very bad hovercraft which are basically gunboats/gunships.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 06:17:34 and not a ac-130
general 2021-12-16 06:19:00 i have enver ehard of this
probably for a good reason
general 2021-12-16 06:19:30 no
general 2021-12-16 06:19:45 <@!715148402022678608>  yes spamming :real:
general 2021-12-16 06:20:21 <@!404509323360862209>  No spamming.
general 2021-12-16 06:21:07 <:OMEGALUL:528987216643489792>
general 2021-12-16 06:21:52 tinon do you want hot cocoa
is december
is cold
general 2021-12-16 06:23:03 le trol
general 2021-12-16 06:23:22 anyways so uh Tinon? what do i build before i needa go sleep?
general 2021-12-16 06:24:49 E
general 2021-12-16 06:25:36 yes but can you drop it on people
general 2021-12-16 07:00:50 hello chat
general 2021-12-16 07:00:52 anyways uh
general 2021-12-16 07:01:08 tmrw i make a spaceship or hovering gun-platform, i guess.
general 2021-12-16 07:01:25 probably could build a drone of some sort.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:03:00 hello again chat
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:03:21 so uh
now that i know hwo to make stuff float in the middle of the air using keybound anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:03:30 ima build somethign tmrw
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:03:35 currently sleep is needed
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:03:45 30,000.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:20:22 i return
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:20:46 anyways time to build a proof of concept to myself on a spaceship/ship that never falls down while in the air not oving
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:21:01 i could just set a keybind to like E or smthing for this
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:22:03 i dont need luck
i only need keybinded anchor blocks
general 2021-12-16 17:26:15 alright so
general 2021-12-16 17:26:25 the Snow blaster is classified as a thruster?
general 2021-12-16 17:26:29 w-what
general 2021-12-16 17:26:48 im sorry this makes 0 S E N S E
general 2021-12-16 17:28:24 snow pipe/blaster i forgot which one
the oen in the tab with hover thrusters
general 2021-12-16 17:28:27 yeah that one
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:41:25 i made my acc in 2018
probably before you
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 17:41:50 also i dont even know who you are
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:06:54 aight so heres the frigate after i made it fly
it is indeed trash
but it has guns, so.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:08:30 basically what it is
its actually decent on the water
in the air? not sure
no ones killed it yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:28 its meant to kill stuff not look pretty
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:10:11 how exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:10:35 am stupid
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:10:53 doesnt that fling you to brazil
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:11:20 im going to add a cannon on thsi that shoots fabric wings with seats on them
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:11:31 tactically flinging people
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:11:38 532
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:11:45 and thats with a hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:12:29 it slows down rpetty fast
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:12:39 if i press S my speed goes down pretty quick
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:13:27 also in my server theres a guy abusing blacklist to fire his turret at ppl
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:15:45 found how to counter the blacklsit guy
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:15:50 the answer is rockets
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:15:57 damn its a good thing i installed a rocket turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:17:12 nah
i dotn spam cutters
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:17:14 i use guns
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:17:26 all 10 guns are on turrets on the flyng biscuit i call a frigate
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:17:32 5 gun turrets
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:17:39 2 at the bottom
3 at the top
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:19:23 then theres the 2 rockets on 1 turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:19:30 damn i need put in more rocket turrets
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:19:33 or add a missile
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:19:36 both would work
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:19:56 has any1 built a missile with a hoverdrive?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:20:29 i somehow just recorded a video
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:20:30 uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:20:33 w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:22:38 whered the video go
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:22:50 the video vaporized
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:23:50 also whyd y video dissapear
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:23:53 it vaporized
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:04 i got a ping about it but the ping is gone
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:16 im not even sure what happened but uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:33 i got a ping in ehre i went to check and the video was gone
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:38 no response or reason
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:47 it was the one of my frigat ehovership thing i built
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:24:50 like 5 second video
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:36:10 random fun fact about the frigate that looks like a dry biscuit i built
it supposed to be based on highfleet in the diea and grand scheme of things
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:37:01 its a giant block of parts and guns? check.
it can execute some things, but not others without tweaking it.
it also has no fuel blocks, but even then we arent using conventional thrusters.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:41:22 also i built it to the music of the elite strike fleet groups you can encounter if you have your radar on
i will explain what they are in 1 sentence.
"If you start to here this.... *Tanc a Lelek*
Your already dead."
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:41:33 and i truly do mean that
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:41:37 first SG? fine.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:41:52 SECOND? 300 SHIPS WITH HEAVY ARTILLERY.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:43:09 tanc a lelek plays ingame when you have your radar turned on for more than a second
its also how you die to 6 cruise missiles.
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 23:32:56 alright im back
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 23:34:08 And, i bring a simple idea to you all
I've said this once ill say it again
giant hoverships that are N O T V T O L S based on stuff from Highfleet.
the-dump 2021-12-17 02:05:24 O O F
the-dump 2021-12-17 02:10:40 
the-dump 2021-12-17 02:10:49 now then time for no context memes
the-dump 2021-12-17 02:11:11 
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:14:22 would work
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:14:37 the cluster of bricc
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:15:32 somehow my frigate which i converted to a flying ship would fly better than that id think
it looks like it turns at the speed of a snail
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:17:50 exposed motorlocks
CRINGE
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:11:13 i just get back from playing highfleet and i immediately run into ppl messing with a moderator
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:11:18 i am seriously confused
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:17:15 anyways so uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:17:25 should i make a ship with Gimballed engines?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:17:33 like a vtol but with r o c k e t s
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:42:40 alright so i was on the subreddit, right?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:43:08 then i see a x-shredder.
THEN I REALISE IT HAS THE PERFECT SET OF CONTROLS TO BE SUED TO RECREATE STUFF FROM HIGHFLEET.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:43:28 ships in highfleet generally use GImballed engines and the one i wanna recreate is the Lightning.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:43:42 and no i wont actually build the shredder im copyng the controls
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:43:49 i want to sue its engine, not the ship.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:44:38 the X-shredder has a very unique and very usable design. i will recreate its engines, and test.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:44:51 3 hours is enough to test.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:50:56 fairly sure i shot down 2 battleships in a very tiny somali pirate-escue boat like 4 days ago
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:51:22 without taking damage
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:51:33 yeah those 2 battleships had skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:51:37 mine was 46
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:52:20 mine was raw blocks, very small, and only waterwheels.
main trump card? rockets.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:52:29 1 rocket and 2 guns on a turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:52:49 the thing is it was only 1 rocket i fired per cycle
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:53:21 i kinda dismantled it already and rebuilt it into something bigger so uhh...
I c a n t
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:53:46 but what i do remember
IS THAT IT WAS LIKE 6-8 BLOCKS LONG.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:54:34 i can rebuild it by memory. 2 water wheels in a back chassis, and 2 for turning. 1 turret near the front with one left mounted rocket and 2 guns on the right.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:55:06 i built thsi ship like on monday, dude.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:55:19 its not hard to remember a boat i built in like 25 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:55:44 less than 25 actually
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:55:46 shits small
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:55:56 if i had a photo id send it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:07 unfortunately, i didnt take one as i already planned toe dit it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:12 it si now my Frigate.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:23 i made it l o n g
and gave it more turrets
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:35 then i made it fly
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:43 i ahve a video of the flying frigate.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:54 the back like 8 blocks was where the original ship was.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:56:59 near the back.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:57:21 shut the hell up and let me speak. I edite dhte boat and amde it larger.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:57:48 the original is still intact, if you looked at the back end of the frigate youd see a oddly opened area with 2 staalizers.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:58:07 where thsoe 2 parralel stabalizers are were where the waterwheels went.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:58:31 Join my Server, ill show you the frigate.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:59:04 Ive repalcedparts on the seafaring version, the waterwheels wer repalced by water propellers
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:59:16 because i didnt know hwo to make a stabile hover drive for a B O A T
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:59:29 ill show ya directly.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:59:50 Fine.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:00:46 Dont get amd at me for thsi but Parts ahev been replaced. the back propeller was where the waterwheels went.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:00:58 ived edited this ship more times than i can count.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:02:14 Give em critiques, but i am no liar. See that large waterprop 2 in the back? those were where the 2 waterwheels went, The other 2 waterwheels are on the side mounted ones that look like tubes pointing left and right.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:02:27 the original design was very flat
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:02:50 i know its flat THE ORIGINAL BOAT WAS FLAT
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:04:46 Recorded, gonna dm you it because for some reason they disspear if i post them in here
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:07:17 I gave them proof.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:07:21 Now, i wait.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:08:05 however jsut to prove that im not being stupid.  the farthest back turret is where the original turret which was at the FRONT OF THE BOAT was.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:10:09 ppl saying that i didnt murk 2 battleships in a dinky little boat
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:10:17 which i did, because they had skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:10:40 technically if i made the frigate wider and made it a cruiser i can get shipwright 1
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:10:56 correct
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:11:08 yes because i suck at building
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:15:27 the thing is that larger boat back end is the original boats frame, just expanded.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:16:09 AC 130
giant wingspan, if it didnt have that itd not fly or evne if it could itd be terrible to fly
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:16:57 the ac130 is HUGE.
if someone built one with like a 1x1 wingspan itd just wobble like crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:17:38 mini AC-130S have been built
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:17:57 how do you make a normal-plane sized ac130 and make it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:18:18 rockets do nto care for blackists
rockets are rockets
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:18:56 no proof =/= it existed
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:19:03 you clearly did have one
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:19:08 im jsut trying to build rn
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:35:54 aight so i built the engine of the [REDACTED], time to NOT USE AS INTENDED and instead put a gun turret on both sides of it along with a anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:37:21 he got downvoted by the 10 yr old shredderscrubs tryna actually find a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:42:27 anyways, the [REDACTED] is complete
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:42:36 i will not be saying its anme nor hwo i made it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:42:54 because youd get mad at me
no its nto a classic shredder, no, its not a  O R B .
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:42:56 the X
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:42:59 the x.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:43:04 no cutters, only g u n
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:43:24 main purpose for it? its fast.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:43:40 as in it goes at 4k if you rpess your speed key for less than 3 seconds.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:44:30 honestly the thing is
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:44:41 the X-shredder looks like somethign youd find in Highfleet.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:44:55 thus i steal the design and remove the cutters because i know cutters are annoying
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:45:00 they piss me off too yknow
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:45:09 instead it got turrets.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:45:59 Shuriken Cannon?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:46:07 neat.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:46:48 alright time for a random unpopular opinion
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:47:12 but uh, shredder bugs, annoying as they may be, are fun to fly, especially the x-shredders, specifically ebcause tis manuevers very well.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:47:33 and when i mean well i mean THIS MOVES BUTTERY SMOOTH.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:48:12 whenever i see someone while pilotign this ima make a highfleet joke
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:49:10 also when i do get speakers ima keybind it to t and set it to Tanc a lelek.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:49:17 which is used as the Strike group music
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:49:28 they kinda tresh
cause motorlock exists
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:50:17 i think thats only sued for railguns
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:57:22 anyways time to get a screenshot of the [REDACTED]
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:58:24 this is the REDACTED
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 05:59:52 any gun cant shoot through that gap, its too large. a 50 BMG could go through that.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:00:36 My server is under siege by shredderbugs.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:00:40 You know what to do.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:01:54 i will not waste a good battle.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:04:57 i killed 3 shredder balls, and 16 assorted shredderdrones.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:05:07 and ive taken 0 total damage thus far.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:13:08 Total Kills thus far is 11-13.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:13:18 All of which were either shredders or cancer turrets.
general 2021-12-17 06:18:20 buenos noches
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 06:42:04 Lightning-Class Interceptor, 2 Turrets, good mobility, Buttery smooth controls
general 2021-12-17 18:13:10 aight so
general 2021-12-17 18:13:38 i got a spam message from a guy named pe
dudes tryna make me go into a discord about his friends mc server
Which isnt his server bu likely a tokenlogger.
general 2021-12-17 18:13:53 if you ever see them or anything related to Blockfun, i suggest you block them.
general 2021-12-17 18:14:27 a bot
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 19:18:31 where dio you even find the private servers or colors fr our name
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 19:18:42 i cant see #colors or the ps area.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 19:22:30 so you need expert to have colored names? thats wrong.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 19:23:09 so i needa spend the rest of christmas break to have a tan-colored username?
bot-central 2021-12-18 07:16:12 -servers
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 02:44:45 a boat of course
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 02:44:57 anyways
has anyone rebuilt the boat from DST before?
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 02:45:06 yknwo the  P L A T F O R M B O A T
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 02:45:25 the boat from dont starv is a pancake
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 04:11:51 i wonder if anyones made ships from Highfleet yet?
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 04:11:55 this my third time asking
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 04:12:07 ITS A HOVERSHIP WITH A TURRET. thats all it needs.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 04:19:39 I havent even checked yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:06:41 im back
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:06:46 anyways uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:06:52 i searched hoverships
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:06:55 i was nto dissapointed
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:06:59 but uh, anyways.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:07:13 the ships from Highfleet dotn truly hover, they fly and hover.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:07:20 basically a spaceship not meant for space.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:22:55 is the datastore no longer having a seizure?
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:25:28 it does appear datastore isnt tryign to die
good, i can play
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:40:06 aight so
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:40:19 i upgraded the ship i was working on recently and uh.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:40:28 it now actually looks good
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:40:32 due to gunmetal coloring
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:51:35 Customization of current project is Complete.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:51:46 Both turrets have special auxiliary weapons mounted.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 06:52:00 1 has extra firepower in Guns, the other has 2 Rockets.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 20:16:18 I am back with something new.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 20:16:44 a UAV with a Cargo Pod, said cargo pod holds the pilot seat.
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 20:17:00 also, use the camera glitch, then cargo drop yourselve somewhere safe
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 20:17:04 i chose the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 20:17:57 the UAV variant of the larger variant which isnt a UAV.
general 2021-12-22 17:42:54 uh so
general 2021-12-22 17:42:56 random question
general 2021-12-22 17:43:00 my discord audio is glitched
general 2021-12-22 17:43:04 where i cant hear anything
general 2021-12-22 17:43:22 and i dont have a tab to change my audio
general 2021-12-22 17:43:33 my audio tab is goen and my audio is gone  H E L P
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 04:50:35 oh god no
EVERYWHERE I GO
I SEE MOONDROP OR SUNDROP
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 04:50:36 AAAAAAAAAAAA
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:47:19 anyone know how to make a Flak cannon?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:47:28 and i mean a cosmetic one thats just a firework gun
general 2022-01-15 17:14:05 uh hello
general 2022-01-15 17:14:11 yeah so uhh
general 2022-01-15 17:14:36 what is yalls opinions on sun and moon from security breach
mien s that they have too much wholesome content.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:22:29 i want to bleach my soul after seeing that-
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:23:02 *i rarely ever speak in this discord and yet it is advancing my path towards insanity /j*
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:24:15 throw the rat into the deep frier.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:24:54 Kentucky Fried CRat
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:25:04 reggie is a accursed being
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:26:02 i am running on so little sleep and so much coffee and eyestrain i am seeing shit in my peripheral as of current and the cursed images/videos are not helping with this-
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:26:13 there is no punchline.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:27:06 i currently feel as if my skull is a giant microwave slowly turning my brain to mush-
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:28:16 reggie is indeed a boy.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:28:19 i know this.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:28:28 i have seen many things i wish to unsee
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:28:31 but i cannot
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:28:39 ... i would rather not talk about it
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:29:02 the rat is a accursed being.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:29:27 created on twitter, and shortly used for some very cursed content.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:29:41 m8 how old are you
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:30:06 because its a fictional char and thus logic does not exist
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:30:39 so
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:30:39 the rat is around like 4'7 i think
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:30:56 this rat is fairly tall.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:32:31 m8 i rarely ever speak in here why do you think I have a whitename?
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:32:50 cause i aint talented. i havent played plane crazy in like 2 months.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:33:21 needs less cutters. needs more dakka.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:34:32 you are one of us.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:34:48 that is the pot insulting the kettle.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:35:04 ... dammit
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:36:16 i came into this chat to look at memes and promptly got hit with a sudden burst of shock on a already bad day of mine.
the-dump 2022-04-27 23:36:36 i did 6 overdue lessons and a TEST for my algebra class. not fun.
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 04:40:08 soo-
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 04:40:30 randomly built smth when i got online, dont have an image of it yet-
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 04:40:52 *i decided i wanted to build a drone. But i dont follow tutorials so i just.... made a really tiny plane-*
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 04:41:14 *somehow it lasted more than 5 minutes in combat without taking dmg and that surprises me-*
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 18:17:28 ... welp im bored of basically enve rplayign the game despite wanting to build things
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 18:17:51 time to test cancerous designs for 0 reason cause i honestly got like 0 idea on whatto build other than a boat or smth-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 18:21:44 I am a conniseur of all tbhings gunship so this is definitely not going to end in something well-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 18:21:56 *this is gonna go downhill very very quickly*
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 18:31:42 welp it ended badly
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:32:04 Hate. very much hate.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:32:32 i hate this image. why did i decide to make such a wretched creation
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:32:36 this is so very wrong
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:32:40 images that make you angry
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:35:47 thanks I'll use tyhis in response to actual shredder suers
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:35:58 i hate the damn things just as much as anybody else.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:36:10 *however i HAVE soloed a shredderball in a tiny drone.*
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:36:13 i do not know how
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:48:50 Less cancerous, more of "One-time use missile"
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:48:54 still cursed.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:49:34 upon impact
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:49:38 the warhead detonates
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:49:46 and the entire "shredder" turns into dust
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:49:54 i dont have one-
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:50:15 so instead i go with this
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:50:26 its bigger, and probably faster anyways
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:21 it can also
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:23 1shot a hercules.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:27 ... i do not know how.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:29 but it does.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:36 it just... makes it disintegrate
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:51:43 this is cancerous but somehow very fun to use-
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:55:57 ... Not enough explosive power.
the-dump 2022-06-20 18:56:00 it needs more TNT.
the-dump 2022-06-20 20:43:57 I THINK THE DEFENSIVE SATTELITE WAS GOING UP TOO FAST
the-dump 2022-06-20 20:43:59 HELP
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:46:54 behold the worlds most bad boat-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:47:09 this is utter garbage at every role cause idk how to do turrets-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:47:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:47:42 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:47:48 but 1 rocket splits it in half
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:48:52 i honestly need to learn how to do those 2 motor2 turrets
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:48:59 cause i cant exactly do them
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:50:11 it remotely has one
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:50:31 i honestly wanna follow a SAM tutorial and give it like 3-4 Surface-to-Air missiles-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:50:35 ... but thats just me
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:50:59 in giving it SAMs, it'd need to lose like every other turret on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:51:15 so, I might do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:55:20 of course it is
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:55:24 just give it a camera
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:57:11 ... you can always try to aim without the camera
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:57:16 but that might be a built faulty
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 20:59:48 technically isnt it possible to make spike missiles? like, missiles with cutter tips that you just have PLOW through enemy armor multiple times?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:02:12 then just have it dash in agian to cut ANOTHER block-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:02:21 or just have it use a spring to launch a cutter frowards
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:03:39 that could work
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:03:47 but what about "dummy" missiles?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:03:48 Decoys?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:05:00 maybe have the cutter spinning to do multiple hits?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:05:11 so, a fusion of a shredder and a missile
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:06:24 put a motor2 on a motor2 at a dif angle?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:08:43 ... WELP.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:08:47 THE MISSILE WORKS ON THE BOAT-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:08:57 THEY ARE F A S T
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:09:46 ... i already do that-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:09:51 ... so I've been doing it right?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:10:34 so to make an impact missile i need to get TNT on the places where the blocks are, right? and have them all be set to explode on impact?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:11:31 SAMs, installed on my boat-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:11:35 2 SAMs.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:11:48 
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:11:51 like this
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:59:33 well the SAMs arent impact missile, but they do explode if i press the key a second time-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:59:43 should i disable arm on key for them or smth?
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 21:59:47 or keep them like this
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:02:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:04:48 yeah turning off the arm on key
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:04:52 made them impact
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:20:07 but i want them to be impact missiles-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:23:20 THATS IT, IM GETTING ME S A M S-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:23:34 *literally just impact missiles with superrocketengines. thats all they are-*
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:23:39 they explode. thats it-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:23:50 they however dont often impact and have to manually triggered-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:24:06 they are mounted on a boat.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:31:22 o h
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:37:25 well i moved their camera
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:37:27 they work now
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 22:37:31 infact they have trails
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:28:23 man this guy doesnt want to accept a tie.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:28:26 HE IS IN PIECES
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:28:29 LITERAL PIECES
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:29:16 "I win" no, nopt really. we are both sunk.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:29:17 BECAUSE OF A BOMBER
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:30:03 
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:30:13 *... this is annoying, dont be like this guy*
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:34:29 2 SAMs and 4 small machinegun turrets.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:34:41 even though i miss with the SAMs 90% of the time.

plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:53:04 its honestly fun to just see peoples reaction to it just ZOOMING towards them
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:53:46 it doesnt have cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:53:53 it is literally just a bomb
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:54:56 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:55:05 it does have stabiltiy issues and sometimes wont launch
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:55:08 but yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:57:01 LOTS OF TNT IS ON IT-
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:57:07 yet somehow it doesnt have a decent blast-force
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:57:13 theres like, 50 pieces fo TNT on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:58:37 i made it for the memes, shut
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:58:40 s h u t
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:58:47 S H U T
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:58:53 SILENCE, COLORED ONE
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:09 no i did i thought it'd be funny to jsut strap TNT to one
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:13 Cringe.
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:24 atleast its not an x shredder
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:40 shut the actual fuck up with your dead memes my guy
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:48 its a guided missile
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:52 it has no cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 23:59:56 it just manuevers well
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:00:43 doesnt matter its a guided missile-
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:01:07 i t s a m i s s i l e
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:01:18 why are you pinging a mod
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:20 you do realize that the father of shredders are guided missiles.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:24 thats not a good analogy
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:40 its a shredder HULL turned into a missile.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:43 shredding implies cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:45 this has none
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:55 ... how is a bomb a copy
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:02:57 its a b o m b

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:03:52 i still had a shredder lying around in my saves when i joined, and thus i turned it into a bomb
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:04:02 because i hate them just as much as anyone else but this thing is a meme ship
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:04:32 *... I'm 14, what the hell you asking about*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:04:56 ... is a meme ship
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:05:52 I am, i am just chaotic.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:06:13 i am always chaotic. I blame my humor being based on therussianbadger videos and SFM shitposts.

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:10:34 *Why are you pinning shit on someone who doesnt even know who the fuck your talking about*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:11:21 that'd just be a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:11:43 like, how the hell would that be kamikaze its a cessna with bomb bays

the-dump 2022-06-21 00:14:36 before that i didnt do that.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:15:52 I hope yall know that this is literally just unneeded harassment towards someone who wants to meme-
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:16:28 *HOW IS A MISSILE MADE FROM A SHREDDER N O T A MEME*
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:16:57 thats not chaotic at all thats just stupid.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:17:30 I got branded with a nickname due to my PFP and shit going for "meme lord" is just... stupid.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:17:52 no but you sure as hell do-
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:18:29 thats actually a real thing.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:18:35 well it WAS but yeah that does exist
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:18:39 or did.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:20:03 i have literally sat in this server for like 9 months now and i rarely go here because i rarely play this game at all.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 00:20:27 but SAMs are cool-
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:20:55 because i play the game so rarely i don't try to get better at making good-looking builds.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:21:11 cause you PLAYED FOR 8+ HOURS A DAY BUILDING-
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:21:15 thats not healthy.
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:21:23 THAT WILL NEVER BE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH-
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:22:39 You might wanna think before you speak, cause i think you are very close to breaking the rules with what you say. I don't wanna be on your bad side, but you are VERY VERY close to saying something that'd break the rules
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:23:54 You keep trying to do this thing in particular i do not know why, but seriously, why do you keep trying this
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:24:01 I am not an unde-
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:24:17 *.... no the fuck i aint-*

the-dump 2022-06-21 00:25:50 ... thats photoshop,
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:27:55 or an old online birthday card site. probably the latter.

the-dump 2022-06-21 00:32:39 i now see why i play this game so rarely
the-dump 2022-06-21 00:32:47 Cause of yall.
general 2022-06-21 00:42:56 mech vs boat, though-
general 2022-06-21 00:43:00 *that depends*
general 2022-06-21 00:43:05 *Depends on the boat-*
general 2022-06-21 00:43:16 boats have shite aim on lesser quality ones.
general 2022-06-21 00:43:19 so... missiles
general 2022-06-21 00:43:22 get missiles
general 2022-06-21 00:43:24 or just aim good
general 2022-06-21 00:44:54 i use a frigate that is *VERYSLOW*
general 2022-06-21 00:45:01 ... but it does have 2 SAMs.
general 2022-06-21 00:45:06 which i dont use for SAM duties
general 2022-06-21 00:45:09 i just use them as missiles
general 2022-06-21 00:45:41 i dont exactly have much aircraft
general 2022-06-21 00:45:46 and i have 1 boat-
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:06:33 *the vehicle with the Davy Crockett Recoilless Rifle?*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:07:51 with a gun that fires explosives-
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:07:55 *could fire a Cluster Bomb-*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:08:07 the sheetmetal brick?
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:10:07 for detail: *it needs guns. give it a artillery cannon*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 01:19:48 yes
general 2022-06-21 15:46:01 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

general 2022-06-21 15:48:43 .... do you not know how blacklists work my guy
general 2022-06-21 15:48:59 *it blacklists you from DOING ANYTHING in that channel-*
the-dump 2022-06-21 15:49:30 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/942681995295748128/977790370316423199/image0-9.gif

general 2022-06-21 15:52:03 are you suggesting it to work like starscapes media blacklist, where you can see stuff, but not post or talk in that chat?
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:53:09 you are either trolling, or, if not, i think the default keybind is g
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:37:44 a simple boat, with 2 impact-sensitive missiles-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:37:49 *which actually work decently*
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:37:52 somehow
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:40:21 *better turning-*
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:40:32 however these missiles arent the fastest
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:40:41 mainly due to a superrocketengine making them wobble a lot
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:40:42 so
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:52:48 so if i do that it just expldoe upon connecting either way?
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:52:56 but what if it misfires and falls into the water-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:53:33 the motor already is toggled so it can guide
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:53:36 its in a holder
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:54:19 but why would i do that it works just fine like 75% of the time
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 01:54:27 plus i'd have to set that for 2 MISSILES
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:00:01 the suspension tip works pretty well
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:00:15 but i have to camera guide them or they shoot a bit offcourse-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:01:01 yeah that detonates ALL of the tnt at once
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:02:15 thanks m8
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:03:35 but thats not a bad thing it detonates like, a second after the other not just ALL at the same time-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:04:29 they all have 75 impact though
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:25:17 judging from the effectiveness of INSTANTLY TEARING A SPEEDBOAT MY FRIEND MADE into tiny tiny pieces, y e s
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:37:14 something slow so i can hit it with missiles /j
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 04:01:31 more b o a t
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 04:10:47 for melting nearby missiles-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 04:10:53 oh, and tank version
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:35:59 turned my missile boat into a artillery platform-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:37:59 i know its bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:38:02 but, missiles
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:15:23 and then i decided to give this "Sattelite" *aka something that users helium and parachutes to hover in place at a certain height* PD guns and a "rangefinder" missile tha ti just... strapped guns to-
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:15:38 i dont even know if that can be called a missile tbh
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:15:42 its more of a guide munition
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:20:25 also the sattelite can fire all 4 of its turrets in all directions
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:20:30 so, thats neat
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:20:33 i guess
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:22:47 idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:27:21 yes yes i know
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 18:27:23 now shut up
general 2022-08-04 20:19:10 we just see it as yellowish-orange-white because we arent supposed to stare at it and doing so burns our eyes.
general 2022-08-04 20:19:33 *or it could be orange due to the fact its basically made of pure energy and fuel and its burnin all the time but eh*
general 2022-08-04 20:19:49 you would literally go blind
general 2022-08-04 20:20:17 dude you have a changed pfp dont you lecture me about science
general 2022-08-04 20:20:30 :)
general 2022-08-04 20:20:44 *I have seen the void to never return.*
general 2022-08-04 20:20:46 I just know.
general 2022-08-04 20:20:50 i regret knowing.
general 2022-08-04 20:21:23 changed is weird.
general 2022-08-04 20:21:28 like everything about it
general 2022-08-04 20:21:49 sure maybe there was a good artstyle that doesnt change the fact *its a game about avoiding creatures made of liquid latex*
general 2022-08-04 20:22:41 in the upcoming extension things go from cursed to MORE CURSED
general 2022-08-04 20:24:12 to be frank i really could not care
general 2022-08-04 20:24:26 Also, does base changed even have a 9-tailed fox?
general 2022-08-04 20:24:55 ... *you bought the expansion didnt you*
general 2022-08-04 20:24:58 or got an image from it
general 2022-08-04 20:25:27 ok cool i guess
general 2022-08-04 20:25:42 ... play project wingman.
general 2022-08-04 20:26:32 nice
general 2022-08-04 20:26:56 alrighty then
general 2022-08-04 20:28:01 go to <#495286269459300364>  you absolute buffoon
general 2022-08-04 20:28:14 you cant embed here without special roles
general 2022-08-04 20:29:07 m8 you are the definition of slender
general 2022-08-04 20:29:29 :)
general 2022-08-04 20:31:06 your bein sarcastic but if you weren't i would definitely try to send that one gif of morshu telling you to get out. except that'd be rude.
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:33:11 I was wrong, <@456226577798135808> 
You, my good sir, have a decent outfit.
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:33:51 oki doki
general 2022-08-04 20:35:44 they wanted freecam or smth, which they probably wouldnt have got either way they did from what I see of this
general 2022-08-04 20:36:31 Freecam as a external program is most likely a virus, the only way to really get freecam is either command or by exploiting. neither are good, dont cheat or i will sick the shredders in my basement on you
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:38:52 that looks like how a slender would look in like... 2012? and even then thats better fashion sense then whatever the current slenders are.
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:39:01 4k robux for a literal FACE, imagine.
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:39:58 havent spent any on PCC. have spent like over 200 on roblox itself.
the-dump 2022-08-04 20:40:05 Mainly for outfits and gamepasses.
general 2022-08-04 20:40:59 you do realize the more money the devs get the more funding they have to keep in running, right?
general 2022-08-04 20:41:08 money is essential for literally everything in the world.
general 2022-08-04 20:42:00 Most of them are edgy ace combat protag wannabes, and the other 25% are just flat-out toxic for the purpose of ruining peoples fun tbh.
general 2022-08-04 20:42:55 that poor jet
general 2022-08-04 20:43:03 what have they done to that thing
general 2022-08-04 20:43:09 that is so very wrong
general 2022-08-04 20:43:39 this is why we cant have nice things
general 2022-08-04 20:44:20 ... I dont even-
general 2022-08-04 20:44:33 ... my brain just crashed like a windows vista hold on
general 2022-08-04 20:45:04 Make it look like it was haphazardly built yet somehow not exploding
general 2022-08-04 20:45:22 I am fairly sure that thing was a prototype for a tank destroyer
general 2022-08-04 20:45:37 ... one with 7 cannons? i forgot
general 2022-08-04 20:45:57 dang i was just guessing
general 2022-08-04 20:46:03 i did not think id be right
general 2022-08-04 20:47:03 that literally looks like the scorpion from halo 3 for some reason
general 2022-08-04 22:02:16 *.. or tuna*
general 2022-08-04 22:02:36 Tuna=Fishes get REALLY, REALLY BIG and that could easily fish like 500+ of them
general 2022-08-04 22:03:17 at that point you are using the fish for target practice
general 2022-08-04 22:03:20 or for fun
general 2022-08-04 22:03:22 still not good
general 2022-08-06 00:39:34 Tailed i have a question-
general 2022-08-06 00:39:39 *if you even are here that is*
general 2022-08-06 00:40:15 ... that question is *where the hell did you even get that PFP*
general 2022-08-06 00:40:31 i know its from changed. what i dont know is *where the hell in the game does a kitsune even exist*
general 2022-08-06 00:40:41 not you, <@619312093962829849>
general 2022-08-06 00:41:10 ... that PFP looks strangely familiar.
general 2022-08-06 00:44:33 people on the streets are probably spies.
general 2022-08-06 00:44:41 Unless im confusing that with korea.
general 2022-08-06 00:44:44 Korea is worse.
general 2022-08-06 00:45:02 every "Citizen" on the streets in north korea are paid actors. thats not a joke.
general 2022-08-06 00:45:11 they are literally faking citizens.
general 2022-08-06 00:45:42 and everyday transit. and workers.
general 2022-08-06 00:45:49 Everyone, is, hired.
general 2022-08-06 00:45:55 the real citizens work from home.
general 2022-08-06 00:46:18 fuckin performers, who were actual citizens who got good jobs.
general 2022-08-06 00:47:05 they also brag about havign a powerful (insert military thing here) when its actually ABSOLUTE CRAP.
general 2022-08-06 00:47:17 THEIR MISSILES LITERALLY HAVE FALLEN APART AND SHATTERED IN THE MIDDLE OF TAKING OFF.
general 2022-08-06 00:47:51 play new vegas or i will make you commit tax fraud
general 2022-08-06 00:48:17 honeslty I'm surprised their "Nukes" havent actually just exploded from how terrible everything is there.
general 2022-08-06 00:48:23 like, exploded without control.
general 2022-08-06 00:48:28 they do not have a grasp on anything.
general 2022-08-06 00:48:30 at all
general 2022-08-06 00:49:08 they probably force people to, because *its a dictatorship*
general 2022-08-06 00:49:11 THAT WE SOMEHOW ALLOW.
general 2022-08-06 00:49:56 why do we allow a dictatorship ran by ONE PERSON who has their country so UNBELEIVABLLY UNSTABLE that it is liable for a LITERAL REBELLION to break out in less than 4 years.
general 2022-08-06 00:50:41 ... the US isnt any better.
general 2022-08-06 00:50:57 with how things are going we nearly BOUND to have a nuclear war or a second civil war within 15 years.
general 2022-08-06 00:51:20 everythings going to crap and theres nothing we can do about.
general 2022-08-06 00:51:23 EVERYONES CORRUPT.
general 2022-08-06 00:52:04 THE WORLDS RAN BY BILLIONAIRES WHO EXPLOIT THE COMMON MAN/WOMEN/ANYONE FOR MONEY AND LABOUR.
general 2022-08-06 00:52:27 its a goddamn wonder we HAVENT IMPLODED YET.
general 2022-08-06 00:52:43 more of a look on life on how messed up everything is.
general 2022-08-06 00:52:52 FACEBOOK LITERALLY TRACKS YOUR EVERY MVOE.
general 2022-08-06 00:53:10 you can download you data. it has *every single thing you've done on your phone/pc recorded. everything.*
general 2022-08-06 00:53:12 its not ok.
general 2022-08-06 00:53:43 ... nope, its still bad.
general 2022-08-06 00:54:31 everyone thinks that the world is fine and dandy but in reality we are 1 step away from everything exploding and going to hell.
general 2022-08-06 00:54:45 nothing is alright, and everything is terrible, once you think on it.
general 2022-08-06 00:55:02 i do, there jsut *isnt a reason to make false hope right now*
general 2022-08-06 00:55:14 there is literally 0 reason to. everything is going terribly.
general 2022-08-06 00:58:53 most likely.
general 2022-08-06 00:59:17 we literally allow towns and garrisons for *those who shall not be named* in the us.
general 2022-08-06 00:59:23 ... like, why the hell?
general 2022-08-06 00:59:41 our world fakes itself as everything being fine when it is indeed, Not Fine™️
general 2022-08-06 00:59:46 anyways hi nine
general 2022-08-06 00:59:52 sorry about the ping
general 2022-08-06 01:00:05 the conversation went from normal to me ranting-
general 2022-08-06 01:01:55 ... no we allow "Sundown-towns" to exist, and frankly that is concerning.
general 2022-08-06 01:02:03 google the term and you will understand why.
general 2022-08-06 01:04:33 cause theres no reason to eb positive when the entire world is going this horribly.
general 2022-08-06 01:05:35 Your lifes going just fine, but look around and you will see that soon enough, everythings gonna come crashing down.
general 2022-08-06 01:05:47 And this will be relevant to you. eventually.
general 2022-08-06 01:05:56 everything that can go wrong shall go wrong
general 2022-08-06 01:06:39 ... did you just insult me for existing?
general 2022-08-06 01:06:45 Ok, thats just rude.
general 2022-08-06 01:08:06 development takes time, i dont blame them.
general 2022-08-06 01:09:24 ... is that sand, or?
general 2022-08-06 01:09:25 ?
general 2022-08-06 01:16:45 blocks you can put textures on
general 2022-08-06 01:17:31 rockets are "Guided" a bit already, but for missiles, you need a multiblock design, around 18 OR MORE BLOCKS just to make ONE MISSILE.
general 2022-08-06 01:17:52 itd be a lot easier if we could get a missile weapon we can just aim with the mouse
general 2022-08-06 01:18:09 if you arent using a motorlock one, thats a average cost.
general 2022-08-06 01:18:33 stuff you dont have to build with multiple blocks, i mean.
general 2022-08-06 01:18:59 Like a "missile rack" in the weapons category, with 3 1-time use mouse guided missiles.
general 2022-08-06 01:19:15 thats a turret, and that makes sense.
general 2022-08-06 01:19:52 you responded with a turret design though.
general 2022-08-06 01:19:59 4 blocks?
general 2022-08-06 01:20:09 how the hell do you make a missile with 4 blocks
general 2022-08-06 01:20:17 8 is more... reasonable-
general 2022-08-06 01:20:30 8 is more reasonable cause that would work for a anti-ground one.
general 2022-08-06 01:20:43 for a SAM you need MOTOR 2S for better control
general 2022-08-06 01:25:23 or people who make giant MISSILE BATTERIES to make the people flying suffer due to 180 SAMs at once.
general 2022-08-06 01:25:36 because there'd probably be a config for types of missile.
general 2022-08-06 01:25:43 be it Anti-ground, anti-ship, or ANTI AIR.
general 2022-08-06 01:25:50 anti-air would be the most annoying.
general 2022-08-06 01:25:55 because its FAST
general 2022-08-06 01:26:38 suicide uav?
general 2022-08-06 01:26:43 dude, thats just a missile.
general 2022-08-06 01:26:59 if it has a gun, its a UAV though.
general 2022-08-06 01:27:12 unless its a missile, that shoots missiles, then its an MIRV.
general 2022-08-06 01:27:39 if its a missile that shoots unguided rockets, it is ALSO an mirv.
general 2022-08-06 01:27:50 most MIRV's use unguided rockets.
general 2022-08-06 01:28:59 if its a missile, that shoots missiles, that have guns, its...
general 2022-08-06 01:29:01 .... no
general 2022-08-06 01:29:03 dont do that
general 2022-08-06 01:29:22 taping 2 missiles to another missile works
general 2022-08-06 01:30:29 thatd be a UAV
general 2022-08-06 01:30:35 or a bomber
general 2022-08-06 01:30:53 autonomous missiles with heat-seeking would ALREADY be scary.
general 2022-08-06 01:31:09 AUTONOMOUS DRONE PLANES IN A GIANT SQUADRON, HOWEVER?
general 2022-08-06 01:31:12 THAT IS INSANITY.
general 2022-08-06 01:31:14 THAT IS MAD.
general 2022-08-06 01:31:21 THAT, WOULD BE WORSE THAN SHREDDERS.
general 2022-08-06 01:31:23 A LOT WORSE.
general 2022-08-06 01:32:20 ... w-what the hell are those?
general 2022-08-06 01:32:29 ... do they even have engines?
general 2022-08-06 01:32:47 S T E B
general 2022-08-06 01:33:16 now imagine autonomous boats on the water with gunnery AI gunning down your plane.
general 2022-08-06 01:33:37 or, autonomous boats ARMED TO THE TEETH WITH AAMS.
general 2022-08-06 01:33:55 imagine a drone boat with 18 ARMORED ANTI-AIR MISSILE RACKS.
general 2022-08-06 01:33:58 WHICH IT CAN RELOAD.
general 2022-08-06 01:34:24 sounds like a job for someones submarine. or missile.
general 2022-08-06 01:34:25 or both
general 2022-08-06 01:35:08 how did you even build those?
general 2022-08-06 01:35:14 and how did you build SO MANY OF THEM?
general 2022-08-06 01:35:26 you cant copy and paste blocks you had to BUILD THOSE THINGS BY HAND
general 2022-08-06 01:37:03 no im surpised someone had the determination to build 100 12-block spike missiles
general 2022-08-06 01:37:14 *ace combat 7*
general 2022-08-06 01:38:11 it is not very hard to make UAVs.
general 2022-08-06 01:38:32 i made one by shrinking a starter plane design and puttin a gun on it
general 2022-08-06 01:38:50 6 blocks is all it takes to make a insanely tiny plane
general 2022-08-06 01:39:33 ... 3 if you want to drop them from planes or smth, but anything smaller than 3 is probably impossible.
general 2022-08-06 01:39:39 unless you use glitches
general 2022-08-06 01:40:03 .. but even then, why?
general 2022-08-06 01:40:11 one turret would get rid of that UAV
general 2022-08-06 01:41:38 if you paint it in cyan/atmospheric camo i am going to bomb your building area with cluster bombs
general 2022-08-06 01:42:50 i put cameras on my missiles because i dont drop them from planes.
general 2022-08-06 01:43:01 because i cant make a competent enough plane to do so
general 2022-08-06 01:43:44 oh god, those are fast.
general 2022-08-06 01:44:07 ... and now i wanna build one, put a camera on it and just NYOOM into someone
general 2022-08-06 01:44:12 cause that sounds fun
general 2022-08-06 01:44:34 ... however to make my own competent ANYTHING i need to learn motorlock dont i
general 2022-08-06 01:45:06 i have ideas, but they require too much motorlock for my puny brain to comprehend-
general 2022-08-06 02:19:58 ah yes, recoiless howitzers.
the-dump 2022-08-06 02:41:43 a weapon to surpass metal gear /j
the-dump 2022-08-06 02:41:48 *this is very terrible, please do not do this*
general 2022-08-06 04:36:42 Medium rare, just enough for the fat to taste the best, and just enough to easily cut apart.
general 2022-08-06 05:44:55 question, why do yall not like haydog or lgbtq people anyways?
general 2022-08-06 05:45:04 just a question cause yknow, it makes 0 sense to me-
general 2022-08-06 05:48:51 its something i got from my friend, do i need a reason to want a special PFP made by my friend or something?
general 2022-08-06 05:49:07 i am beginning to see why i stopped playing this game.
general 2022-08-06 05:50:54 like 7 in the actual LGBTQIA roster, and god knows how many more neopronouns. honeslty i dont care about what peoples genders are simply because *why should i care about what someone sees themselves as unless its legitmately breaking the law?*
general 2022-08-06 05:51:40 my brother in christ you brought up the gender argument in the first place
general 2022-08-06 05:52:02 oh, sorry wrong person
general 2022-08-06 05:52:28 I meant <@538959322114424833>
general 2022-08-06 05:55:17 Honestly, the second one of yall starts publically getting people to laugh at hay I'm just gonna leave. cause insulting somehow for something not under your direct control is just plain rude.
general 2022-08-06 05:56:39 You need to build a good build for expert ranks.
general 2022-08-06 05:56:42 and i cant do that.
general 2022-08-06 05:57:00 I"m not skilled at motorlocking or anything, really
general 2022-08-06 05:57:20 is there a minimum block count?
general 2022-08-06 05:57:34 why do you need 4000 blocks minimum, thats... counterproductive
general 2022-08-06 05:57:38 ... oh
general 2022-08-06 05:58:22 Build a giant tower you mean?
general 2022-08-06 05:58:25 ... i can do that.
general 2022-08-06 05:58:49 Actually if i actually tried to build smth i could make a decent plane but i am burnt out on making stuff not even related to the game.
general 2022-08-06 05:59:05 I have spent the past 5 weeks making starship sprites and i am VERY burnt out.
general 2022-08-06 05:59:31 yes. they just dont care much
general 2022-08-06 06:00:18 ANYWAYS
general 2022-08-06 06:01:14 its 12:00 am for me, I am very tired, I'm gonna go and hope this server doesnt explode before i get back online so i can continue to get tired of building things
general 2022-08-06 06:02:01 I barely understand this games creative engine beyond "just try and hope it works" as a design method
general 2022-08-06 06:02:50 which originally resulted in me building a Nye-uncontrollable brick-shaped plane with engines that could go at 6000 per second due to *god knows how many* super rocket engines.
general 2022-08-06 06:03:32 my design theorem does not exist as i am simply too bad at the required skills for the cool and ACTUALLY GOOD pvp stuff because it all requires motorlock or some overtly complex design for a engine or smth.
general 2022-08-06 06:04:19 i dont have time to spend 8 HOURS designing a visually pleasing A-10 Thunderbolt II with air to ground missiles.
general 2022-08-06 06:04:36 WELL TECHNICALLY I DO but honestly its just boring to spend that long building
general 2022-08-06 06:05:32 if i were to even try making a plane i would start with smth small, but decent, maybe a motorlocked ww1-ww2 plane?
general 2022-08-06 06:05:39 smth that wont take forever
general 2022-08-06 06:06:03 *unfortunately that is how i learned the physics engine and how to build missiles*
general 2022-08-06 06:06:36 before tutorials i knew all of NOTHING about  the engine and just made painted tut planes with more guns.
general 2022-08-08 01:42:21 this is proper pimple popping etiquette. if it doesnt have a head, and you pop it, it has a higher risk of infection
general 2022-08-08 01:42:27 which ON THE NOSE
general 2022-08-08 01:43:02 could mean that pimple is on an area labelled "the triangle of death" as infections there will spread to the brain. also, yes, wait for a head
general 2022-08-08 01:43:31 No, I've had those too. they are also pimple. they're just nasty little buggers you cant pop.
general 2022-08-08 01:43:40 and they can develop IN YOUR EAR TOO.
general 2022-08-08 01:43:48 zits can appear just about anywhere
general 2022-08-08 01:43:59 Be glad you havent had a zit in your armpit.
general 2022-08-08 01:44:05 Armpit pimples FUCKING HURT
general 2022-08-08 01:44:15 ... OUCH.
general 2022-08-08 01:44:20 my sincerest condolences
general 2022-08-08 01:44:50 no its because it wont come out fully, it'd still be inside where you popped it and it'd get fucking infected.
general 2022-08-08 01:45:04 same.
general 2022-08-08 01:45:58 i have 2 scarred ones i popped right now.
general 2022-08-08 01:48:44 that happens, but very rarely.
general 2022-08-08 01:48:55 at that point, get it popped by a doctor or it'll get infected.
general 2022-08-08 01:49:21 cause thats a serious risk with pimples inside the nose and eyelid
general 2022-08-08 01:49:27 they can VERY VERY EASILY get infected.
general 2022-08-08 01:49:32 and usually thats not good.
general 2022-08-08 01:50:09 if its in your eyelid you white blood cells might fight the eye itself and make it go blind.
general 2022-08-08 01:50:19 i... i dont think you should do that my guy
general 2022-08-08 01:51:29 ... you do know that implies cutting it out, keeping it in cold storage, and then stitching it back on?
general 2022-08-08 01:51:39 at that point just go to a doctor its probably cheaper
general 2022-08-08 01:51:56 can you pop them back in easily? not sure
general 2022-08-08 01:53:36 that will most likely be possible in the next 10 or so years
general 2022-08-08 01:54:06 you are a lower rank then this guy, dont talk about building to a guy with ALMOST 3 EXPERT RANKS
general 2022-08-08 01:54:45 it used to mean they built better stuff
general 2022-08-08 01:54:51 now? not sure
general 2022-08-08 01:56:03 dont fuckin 🤓 me, i can eat your drywall
general 2022-08-08 01:56:52 your asbestos walls will be forfeit instead
general 2022-08-08 01:57:28 ok dweeb, whatever you say
general 2022-08-08 02:00:26 the only people who build ships are people who make 11000 different aircraft carriers that are good, but theres too many carriers to count-
general 2022-08-08 02:00:44 Seriously, i have seen 180 of the same carrier shape under 17 DIFFERENT NAMES.
general 2022-08-18 23:43:07 also, that kind of revolver wouldnt exist in 1869.
general 2022-08-18 23:44:17 We didnt really use catridge firing revolvers until like 1873, when what is the STANDARD for most revolvers of the time was released, the Colt Single Action Army, or Peacemaker.
general 2022-08-18 23:45:30 I like the Era of the 1870s, mainly for the firearms. so when someone gets a a insult *Completely wrong related to guns* I sometimes respond with the correct info
general 2022-08-18 23:45:54 What WOULDVE been used commonly in 1869 wouldve been the Black powder Cap and Ball Revolver, the Colt walker.
general 2022-08-18 23:45:59 which is a BIG HANDGUN.
general 2022-08-18 23:46:04 like, its a heavy gun
general 2022-08-18 23:47:11 OH so your a shipwright V?
general 2022-08-18 23:47:33 *I wonder, How many* ***Copies of the same Carrier design did you make?***
general 2022-08-18 23:47:46 Most aircraft carriers look the Exact same, or VERY similar.
general 2022-08-18 23:47:55 its a runway with a few point defense guns and thats about it
general 2022-08-18 23:48:07 ... So you made battleships? Good on ya then.
general 2022-08-18 23:48:16 I despise carriers and people who are ace combat wannabes
general 2022-08-18 23:48:25 OH-
general 2022-08-18 23:51:47 I've been here for like 3-6 months but since i play the game so rarely i could care less about buildin all the time

the-dump 2022-08-27 02:54:07 THIS ISNT A RAM ISSUE.

the-dump 2022-08-27 02:55:16 it makes building NEAR IMPOSSIBLE

the-dump 2022-08-27 03:01:12 THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH STUFF FOR A TANK-
the-dump 2022-08-27 03:02:02 i left, but if this guy comes back into a server I'm in again i swear i will try and use a magnetic explosive ball railgun to destroy the damned thing
the-dump 2022-08-27 03:03:02 that is way too unneeded for a fucking tank

general 2022-11-10 00:49:16 its a bolt-action .50 BMG
general 2022-11-10 00:49:40 because a full-AUTO blowback SMG in 50cal THAT SIZE would either shoot itself out of your hands or break your shoulder like it was made of balsa wood
general 2022-11-10 00:50:12 also, even if it WAS a SMG its ballistic firepower due to the shortened barrel and lack of pressure would make it less powerful than a normal .308 round
general 2022-11-10 00:54:39 Source: Brandon Herrera, a person who is making a ak47 is .50 BMG doing a video on this gun and uh, proved that it wouldn't work or was highly impractical if it did work
this is isnt advertising its just actual knowledge from someone who makes guns and uses and reviews guns for a living. somewhat.
dude owns a company that makes custom-built AKs and the like, and the guy himself has a license for fully automatic weapons and the like
I did take this knowledge from video on the thing and since the dude is literally machining a ak-47 upscaled to work as a semi-auto .50 BMG sniper or the like, i think i should believe them more than some reddit meme found on some random subreddit after its been stolen from twitter

general 2022-11-10 01:09:37 and naval mines are just TNT blocks with toggle ballasts and disconnectors to hold them in the hold
general 2022-11-10 01:10:40 then make a big or compressed torpedo
general 2022-11-10 01:10:58 so you can launch saturated ordinance at the boats you wish to explode to more effectively turn them to dust
