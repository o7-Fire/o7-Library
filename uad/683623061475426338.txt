help 2020-07-04 01:51:48 the where you should build the fold thingy is the distance between the folding parts / 2
help 2020-07-04 01:51:53 lemme give an example
help 2020-07-04 01:52:05 if the distance between the two is 4 blocks
help 2020-07-04 01:52:25 then you should build the folding thing 2 blocks from the edge
help 2020-07-04 01:52:36 let me try to build an example and give you a screenshot
help 2020-07-04 01:53:36 Alright, so when you try to fold this
help 2020-07-04 01:53:57 its distance is 4 block
help 2020-07-04 01:54:29 then you gotta build the folding thing 2 block from the edge, like this

help 2020-07-04 01:55:29 like this
help 2020-07-04 01:55:38 the light blue is the edge

help 2020-07-04 01:56:38 but i explained one of the easiest way i think
help 2020-07-04 01:57:03 well there is a problem with two - motor fold thingy
help 2020-07-04 01:57:23 you cant install it on stuffs distanced 3, 5, 7, 9, blocks
