The Tale of araresu (419398437516345345)
general 2022-03-30 17:49:28 how come everyone is so unexpectedly toxic and grammar freaks in the game
general 2022-03-30 17:49:45 i ask one small question some rando attacks me
general 2022-03-30 17:51:03 just proved my point
general 2022-03-30 17:51:13 but ok
general 2022-03-30 17:51:50 well damn ur not wrong at being a failure in basic social interaction
general 2022-03-30 17:52:29 ok
general 2022-03-31 17:44:40 call me stupid but how do i actually use the weapons
general 2022-03-31 17:44:44 like the gun
general 2022-03-31 17:44:54 i cant figure it out

bot-central 2022-04-02 18:09:52 ?rhelp
general 2022-04-02 18:12:06 ok so let me get this straight, u need talent, and also learn how everything in the game works just to suggest something
general 2022-04-02 18:13:08 it still requires some talent
general 2022-04-02 18:13:50 bro this game is literally an invention game
general 2022-04-02 18:14:35 and also the fact that the request is so specific, and the admins would probably know if u stole it off of youtube just to double check
general 2022-04-02 18:14:38 theres no winning here
general 2022-04-02 18:15:46 the fact that to be able to suggest u need talent in the game which has nothing to do with trying to make the game better by ur thoughts
general 2022-04-02 18:15:49 its just stupid
general 2022-04-02 18:16:15 bro omg what
general 2022-04-02 18:16:19 suggesting in general
general 2022-04-02 18:16:46 u need to build something in game to be able to suggest in the server ffs
