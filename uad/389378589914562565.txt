creations-chat 2020-01-25 11:54:32 I made one a while back but sure no harm in 2
creations-chat 2020-01-25 11:55:05 The only thing that annoys me about my sea king is that I can't make a 5 bladed rotor
creations-chat 2020-01-25 11:55:16 I really wish there was an easier way
creations-chat 2020-01-25 11:55:32 Cus even using motors to angle the blades it isn't perfect
creations-chat 2020-01-25 11:55:55 K
help 2020-01-25 12:07:02 So I'm making a sea king and the whole thing is done except the rotors because I want to make it 5 bladed. Anyone know a way to make a symmetrical 5 bladed rotor? I'm really struggling here
help 2020-01-25 15:10:13 Can anyone help me on my previous request about the 5 bladed rotor?
help 2020-01-25 21:05:54 <@!356496377444040706> assuming those wheels are half cylinders, if you replace them with propellor engines you can turn it that way and it will look normal
help 2020-01-25 21:31:05 <@!356496377444040706> yes i did mean like that

creations-chat 2020-01-30 19:19:06 wings more like a 109 but other than that great!
creations-chat 2020-01-30 22:12:43 Nice work! Love the colours, maybe add some gear and that would be cool!
creations-chat 2020-01-30 22:12:52 I prefer the black canopy

creations-chat 2020-01-30 22:15:07 Why thank you! It's a very old build so I reckon I could do much better now but Ive kept it because ive seen no need to get rid of it
creations-chat 2020-01-31 19:24:53 <@!441250402567192576> that is possibly the worst explanation of physics ive ever heard

creations-chat 2020-02-02 15:10:45 lol
creations-chat 2020-02-02 15:13:37 dont make the canopy stick above the fuselage and itll look better
creations-chat 2020-02-02 15:14:10 also maybe take that last 1x2 delta off of the wingtip because the mig21s wings have a slight flat edge
creations-chat 2020-02-02 15:16:11 np

creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:37:11 here is my LAAT/I gunship. look, i made this for posting to the server cus i thought it would be a good idea, and well i know its too tall, too thin and not very good but i spent a lot of effort on this and so i dont mind you downvoting as it is your honest opinion, but please dont verbally criticise it too much as i am very aware it could be way better. thanks anyways
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:37:41 
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:37:51 
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:40:19 thanks for the criticism, maybe if i enlarge the cockpit a bit or move the rear cockpit back more and higher it would look a tad better?
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:40:46 cus the problem is the reason its so thin is i never imagined it so big so i didnt counter the thickness
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:40:49 thanks very much
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:41:13 only 3 blocks eek
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:41:48 got it, may look a bit less tall then. thanks to you all very much for the feedback!
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:46:30 yes, im planning on adding that at a later date. im not entirely finished yet as it doesnt fly
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:49:37 so ive redesigned the cockpit a bit in hopes of making it look less tall, how does this look for a design? i shall also increase the thickness by a half block each side
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:50:25 i shall increase the thickness
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:50:40 thiqque
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:50:55 no, chonk is bad
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:51:01 thats hard for me
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:51:10 like my viggen, too chonk apparently
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:51:30 its hard
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:57:31 Ah yes
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:57:54 The ones that look kinda like sci-fi versions of skycranes lol
creations-chat 2020-02-06 19:58:02 That would be cool

creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:54:14 They vibin tho
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:55:53 Kinda cool tho
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:56:19 I imagine it's hard to make it to scale completely due to the size
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:56:25 Ye I guess
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:57:48 I think in general it's a thing for "experts" to instantly downvote or heavily criticise creations even if they're good just to keep their morals and ego higher than the clouds tbh
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:58:47 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:59:05 It's really hard to make detailed and accurate creations that small
creations-chat 2020-02-06 23:59:44 Why the hell do people like my LAAT so much I despise the thing
creations-chat 2020-02-07 00:00:00 Im completely remaking the body essentially
creations-chat 2020-02-07 00:00:57 Thanks, I put a lot of effort in but I definitely think it's too tall
creations-chat 2020-02-07 00:01:38 So instead of remaking the whole wing and engine boom section im just enlarging the cockpit and making the spacing between the 2 canopies larger
creations-chat 2020-02-07 00:01:49 Also making the body thiccer
creations-chat 2020-02-07 00:01:53 Not too chonk tho
creations-chat 2020-02-07 18:30:39 hey all, my LAAT progress is going great! ive reworked the thiccness and the canopy and also built a wing mounted turret, what do you guys think of the improvement? again i want to thank everyone that helped!

creations-chat 2020-02-09 15:27:12 np
creations-chat 2020-02-09 16:32:18 epic!
creations-chat 2020-02-09 16:46:53 its good, i just think the colour kinda throws it off... also maybe add a tad more detail and make the wings a bit wider. other than that its great. definatly not shit.
creations-chat 2020-02-10 21:08:02 Uh nice

creations-chat 2020-02-12 22:14:43 May I ask what is it with people running on the lowest graphics setting? Not trying to be rude but is it that your pc can't handle max graphics or does it bring some sort of benefit? Just wondering

creations-chat 2020-02-12 22:18:18 I have had no performance issues with my pc and I've always ran at max settings, maybe it's just an internet latency thing

creations-chat 2020-02-14 22:06:50 I only saw people making concordes when I made mine and I mean I know in no way is that bad because as long as they aren't copying it's fine but it's kinda annoying cus I built it for that wow factor, considering not many people have made concordes. But now there is lots
creations-chat 2020-02-14 22:08:31 I've kinda improved mine and I think the canopy and colors looks better but I won't post pics cus literally no one wants to see another pic of my Concorde there is so many
creations-chat 2020-02-14 22:08:41 Don't wanna be that one reposter yano?

creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:13:40 To be honest, isn't the point of posting creations in here to get others opinions?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:14:23 An opinion doesn't have to be "valid" it is his opinion, and he stated what he thought of it
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:15:10 Okay what do you even have to contribute here?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:15:35 In your words, if you don't have a valid opinion to say about others opinions, then fuck off
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:15:53 And right now what youre saying isn't considered helpful nor valid
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:16:02 How am I clout chasing?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:16:15 You are being salty for no reason and it's ridiculous
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:16:36 Over someones fucking opinion, why else do you think this channel was made?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:18:27 Yes, to post creations. But there would be no point in posting them if no input was to be gained?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:18:40 And he provided input, and you got annoyed
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:18:45 Do you see the problem?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:19:22 > noob stop trying so hard to be vipempire nobody fucking cares about your useless opinion fuck off
<@456226577798135808> doesn't sound exactly positive to me
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:19:58 Bruh you are contradicting yourself so hard
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:20:24 Or scroll up?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:21:18 <@454570394343702529> is right, there is things to be improved off of it.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:21:28 It's not impossible, there is plenty
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:22:01 And yet I made a 6 bladed Heli yesterday
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:22:07 Improvise, adapt, overcome
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:22:48 Okay did you really just ask for his feedback then proceed to justify yourself and end with "end of"
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:23:05 Also yeah there are 3 blades props
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:24:26 That wasn't your reasoning beforehand, and even if so you can place props inside
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:24:51 It provides ample power, especially for a vehicle of that size. I can tell by the looks.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:25:43 In fact it may not have had enough power, but why not add more props inside?
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:25:58 Yeah you're right
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:26:36 But at this point i think even the smallest criticism will end in execution
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:26:40 So did noob
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:26:45 He gave plenty
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:26:59 Stop tryna bury his reasoning in your salt
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:27:49 Salt
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:28:50 Who said it needs to do anything? <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:30:29 Dude don't even question it
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:30:47 At this point the slightest criticism may end in mass genocide
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:30:52 Not true
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:31:05 Not how it works
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:31:45 You saying end of doesn't mean I have to obide by you considering you were being unreasonable
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:32:01 This guy makes literally no sense
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:32:12 Well ima head off because it's 1:30am and I have a piano exam tomorrow. So count me exiting now.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 01:32:42 No

creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:50:49 As soon as I made mine everyone started to make them
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:50:55 🤔

creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:53:51 Uh
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:54:06 Idk
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:54:51 I'll admit it's kinda annoying the way I made Concorde cus I haven't seen many then they start flooding in

creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:55:08 But what do I make next

creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:57:38 What about it
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:58:32 I was just saying I saw like none, and a coincidence that they decide to post all at once after I posted mine
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:58:49 It's not a bad thing I was just mentioning it's a tad annoying
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:59:01 Wtf kind of logic is that
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:59:42 Ah yes, I post a Concorde, then about 5 people suddenly telepathically find the server and happen to have concordes saved
creations-chat 2020-02-16 11:59:57 Also why are you making this into an argument just drop it.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:00:24 Right
creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:00:45 Again I didn't say it wasn't allowed, so jet fighter just drop it

creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:03:13 Not well executed? Not tryna be rude
creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:03:44 Okay but time doesn't really matter

creations-chat 2020-03-19 22:18:54 <@439783199988514817> if you think he has a lack of something, it would be wise to advise on what he can improve. Yes, he "is the builder" and it is up to him entirely what he puts on it but if you think it's missing something, tell him what to improve. Don't just be like "yeah it's missing something, not gunna tell ya what tho"
creations-chat 2020-03-26 19:43:40 yeah

plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:13 yeah maybe instead of adding trail blocks they should actually work on game fixes
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:40 and i mean every update says it has "performance updates and bug fixes" but i never seem to feel a difference
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:56 i respect due to roblox game engine bug fixes are probably quite hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:16:22 yeah fax
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:06 imagine if madattak remade the game on unity
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:39 i mean i think the reason hes created it on roblox is because its relatively easy to code compared to other engines and its also free
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:53 i love KSP
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:59 but the kraken is unforgiving

creations-chat 2020-04-22 11:59:13 Very gucci
creations-chat 2020-04-22 12:00:38 Indeed
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:22:49 18t is good
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:33:36 Change the colour and it would be better
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:34:32 Agreed
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:34:47 Try 100 110 75 for the hex colour
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:34:57 It's a good military green
creations-chat 2020-04-22 23:35:19 Sure

creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:08:29 nose a bit pointy, but im not sure how to get it any less
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:09:24 any suggestions on how to improve my 206?
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:09:47 because i like the realistic spin and shutoff
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:09:54 its personal choice.
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:10:08 does for me
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:10:17 is that the one thing you can pick out of it?
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:11:19 also using rockets eliminates most torque
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:11:25 which is why i do it
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:12:26 not on small rotors, it maintains speed
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:12:35 i could literally show you in person
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:13:11 i mean it is compared to some other helis
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:14:48 i appreciate the criticism, i really do. but what im saying is that ive heavily trialed and tested this heli and found that rockets work best for rotor rotation. motors create too much torque and often too glitchy, the rotor maintains a complete constant speed upon blade pitch being added and it works perfectly, as opposed to the motor rotation method being clunky, glitchy and unreliable
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:15:14 of course i am not saying this goes for all builds. i am just stating that this is what worked for me, justifying my use of rockets
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:15:16 thats all
creations-chat 2020-04-26 21:25:19 also my UH-1 Irquois Huey, which im not particulary proud of

creations-chat 2020-04-30 20:21:40 the motors rest on blocks
creations-chat 2020-04-30 20:21:44 so it limits it
creations-chat 2020-04-30 20:21:54 thanks
creations-chat 2020-05-01 12:18:50 Is there anything else I can add to my wildcat?
creations-chat 2020-05-01 12:22:24 <@445069748372373506> in my opinion the problem is you either make it too wide or too jagged, so maybe just do 2 lines of half wedges and make them tilt inwards with motors to create a neat and continuous angle
creations-chat 2020-05-01 22:13:33 <@456226577798135808> as it clearly deeply offended you, block counts must have some sacrilegious meaning to you?
creations-chat 2020-05-01 22:13:56 why does it matter?
creations-chat 2020-05-01 22:14:02 its just extra info on it
creations-chat 2020-05-01 22:14:40 what about it?
creations-chat 2020-05-01 22:15:07 what im saying is that it doesnt affect you

creations-chat 2020-06-28 20:01:21 Just asking because it looks remarkably close to mine

general 2020-06-30 16:26:20 it flies alright
general 2020-06-30 16:26:32 but obvs the game makes it slow to help my frames
general 2020-06-30 16:27:01 and i was wondering if there was any specific block that could cause excess lag that maybe i could shed? like wing panels? do they cause lag?
general 2020-06-30 16:27:10 because i really wanna make this thing a tad faster
general 2020-06-30 17:02:09 mkay thanks for the motor suggestions, i havent got many but ill try to get rid of as many as i can.
general 2020-06-30 17:02:44 i dont think it helps that i had to use singular blocks for the underside to pattern the ablator so there might not be much i can do
general 2020-06-30 17:02:52 ill post the finished thing later.
creations-chat 2020-06-30 18:16:12 <@!533881657380569089> i used emojis on text plates

creations-chat 2020-07-06 17:44:00 helium above the centre mass of the bike would help keep it upright
creations-chat 2020-07-06 17:44:56 for my old bike to roll it i made it so it was supported by cameras but when it rolled motors angled the cameras in such a way that when it rolls the cameras were still flat

creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:25:15 
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:25:23 NOT MINE ^^^

creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:29:18 I have about 24 days in the game and I am not sure how much time people have to spend to be that good
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:29:35 I'll upload a pic of my Saturn V later but I'm not liking where it's going
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:30:47 I used to play a lot but I kinda gave the game a massive break so that's probably why it's only 24
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:31:25 Is that like gemini or something?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:31:34 What is it
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:32:11 Ohhh
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:32:13 Right

creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:34:38 It looks like a crumpled snake when not spawned
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:37:13 Holy sh** people really liked my spitfire for some reason
creations-chat 2020-07-13 12:37:22 Now I'm pressured to finish it really well

help 2020-07-13 15:05:27 i really need an honest opinion here
help 2020-07-13 15:23:04 ight thanks
help 2020-07-13 15:35:25 okay i appreciate the response but when spawned they looked way too long due to the height of the fuselage and so i settled with these wings
help 2020-07-13 15:35:29 
help 2020-07-13 15:35:45 i believe they look better, maybe could be moved 1 forward but ill see
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:41:55 <@!724461096349728824> i will show you my problem
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:42:19 
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:42:27 the fuselage isnt that tall
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:42:35 so the wings being long make it look weird
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:44:29 right side is the redo, im just gunna stick with this.
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:45:41 ok yes this looks better
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:45:45 maybe you were right lol
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:47:12 camo bit too bright, tracks i believe could be better because tanks tend to have wheels not just in a straight line
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:48:14 im just giving things he could improve since he asked
creations-chat 2020-07-13 20:31:01 im so glad i finally finished my spit

help 2020-07-14 16:43:00 mkay no problems with that, im not too familiar with locked motors as my spitfire was my first build using them, do you maybe have a design i could use to pull it in?
help 2020-07-14 16:45:46 oh right so id have to rebuild a lot
help 2020-07-14 16:47:31 would you recommend maybe deleting the back bit and just rebuilding that? like the barrel behind the Styrofoam
help 2020-07-14 16:47:42 because i dont want to have to rebuild that reciever bit
help 2020-07-14 16:48:38 ohhh i see

creations-chat 2020-07-14 18:46:34 <@!693859644493266954> 5 mins? that took you like a couple hours lol
creations-chat 2020-07-14 20:57:53 <@!511559470376026135> thats literally what the other guy did right?
creations-chat 2020-07-15 10:44:27 To be fair grouper this whole server is about voting if you like the creation or not. So if they give you feedback or not, you can't really complain that things didn't go your way. As for people like VIP tho, he kinda just randomly downvotes everything just because he doesn't want people to "be on his level" or whatever.
creations-chat 2020-07-15 16:03:25 it aint much yet but this is a WIP Space Shuttle as you can see, thoughts?

creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:22:35 i dont know, because one is more finished than the other
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:22:45 the bottom looks longer so maybe that
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:23:13 i know its a stretch but im going to very briskly attempt to get into hall of fame
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:23:32 ive never given it a go so i mean its worth a shot, even if im not picked
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:57:13 i have a feeling my shuttles gunna get lost in the ever growing sea of creations
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:57:17 lmao
creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:09:06 <@705533053740777584> yes
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:14:16 It was kind of hard to do it right at the scale, but I just ended up settling with that. I don't think it looks bad.
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:14:39 <@725583147928125461>
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:15:34 Bruh okay, well I'm happy with it and quite frankly that's what matters, I don't know why you have such a problem with it.
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:16:33 Saying it's not that hard doesn't seem that helpful in my eyes, but if you really say so then my apologies, and thanks for the feedback.
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:18:25 In what way do you suggest I could improve it?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:19:51 What do you mean?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:21:14 Bruh, you said the nose was weird. I asked what could improve on the nose
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:22:05 I mean it was a given considering you were saying "the nose looks weird" claiming it was feedback, I then asked how I could improve t
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:22:37 Hm ok
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:24:34 It doesn't look it but by the way I've constructed the nose making it even bigger makes it look way too big so I just settled with that
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:24:41 Can I see your shuttle by the way?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:25:33 Okay
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:26:34 Or if you've posted it just link me the post
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:27:35 Ight
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:28:47 Honestly looks good, if you added some detail on the SRBs like the O rings and stuff that detail I think would make it better
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:28:56 Savage
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:30:06 Also maybe use colour differenciation like for instance making the white slightly beige in certain places, makes the orbiter seem more worn and reused
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:30:15 I found it quite effective
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:30:18 Well
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:30:43 You could maybe make the flag with wing panels or control surfaces and then pull it in with locked motors?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:32:00 You just set the motor on lock and put the keys to ones you don't use and it pulls the greyish bit of the motor inward by a half block distance
creations-chat 2020-07-22 00:57:22 i like
creations-chat 2020-07-22 11:02:13 Moose
creations-chat 2020-07-22 11:04:24 Lmao how many times has this 747SP been posted...
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:41:28 i dont wanna be that guy but can you guys maybe drop an upvote on my shuttle? im tryna get to hof for once
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:42:50 ok then dont, ive seen others ask just for hof so i assumed it was okay. sorry.
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:43:23 okay sorry
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:45:23 <@!670939038999511041> i wasnt crying i just asked and then i apologised idk why youre being so harsh
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:45:40 my first post of it got 58 so i wasnt sure
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:46:03 i know i know
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:46:33 bruh yall dont need to be so harsh to me i simply just asked but i realise it was a bad decision so im sorry for asking
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:46:37 can this be left?
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:48:07 ffs i didnt know it was so hard to get in like youre kinda being a bit too harsh on me here
creations-chat 2020-07-22 13:49:09 i havent ever got close to reaching it so i didnt know what to expect, due to the mass amount of creations being posted i didnt think that it would be much noticed. thats all.
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:47:20 i agree
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:48:42 some people just dislike for no reason, thats all i can say
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:49:06 im kinda giving up on this server, i feel its overly harsh and biased
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:49:50 i know
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:52:10 like with my shuttle, i didnt think it was so bad, and i decided to really push myself and go for hall of fame. and so im aware a lot of people brush past creations and not see them so i politely asked for maybe a couple of upvotes to even see if i could reach the hall of fame. and i mean fair enough if you dont want to upvote thats totally cool and up to you! but to say im "crying about it" and that its "not even close to making it" is just rude
creations-chat 2020-07-22 14:52:33 maybe i shouldve said "can you check it out" instead of "can you upvote" thats my bad
creations-chat 2020-07-22 17:15:06 <@!489910972946055172> tbh it kinda does look the same as the creation
help 2020-07-22 21:09:06 okay excuse me here, but does anyone have a decent design i can use for the doors on my 737-100? ive been trying a while and cant get them like the real thing. any help would be appreciated

creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:34:03 e
creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:36:40 that one doesnt look like mine, but in a game he had copied my Ka-50 after he asked to see it a bunch of times, i dont think its that one, or at least if it is that one hes changed it a lot.
creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:38:39 i do agree, that one is very different in some aspects, but in game you had completely copied my cockpit method, the nose, the intakes, and also how i locked the tail.
creations-chat 2020-11-12 16:40:12 manifolds look great bud.
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 19:40:44 <@!209005642000760832> yeah, it does.
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:45:36 sorry to disturb you all, but i just wanted to show you all not what to be. this kid called "xcawsx" did a BLOCK FOR BLOCK copy of my Mil Mi-18 from rens' video, ive never met him, but this pisses me off really. he didnt even ask. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/748183765016248338/777734023702642698/unsure.PNG
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:47:10 this is mine. clearly just copied. if you meet this kid, give him my greetings.
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:49:12 yeah, does feel very bad.
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:51:02 i put a solid 12 hours or so into that on and off, and to see some limp wristed shit stain come over claiming its his, and POSTING IT TO OTHER SERVERS. this is why i shouldnt put effort into a game like this. (that Blackburn Buccaneer is hot btw)
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:52:47 idk which mod will care enough to take action
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:58:51 im assuming im not gunna get a mod response, ima just hope people find out about him, i shouldnt be too annoyed i guess, its just a build idk.
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:01:03 its on one of rens best build vids tho, and he clearly did a shit paint job. its just so obviously a copy. (thanks ViRAtech, i agree)
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:33:29 yeah
creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:22:33 i think saying "EvErYtHiNg" is wrong with it is a bit much but yeah it could do with some improvements
creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:24:35 wow longtime you really got me there, you must feel so proud of yourself. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:31:39 yeah sure its a custom carrier but that doesnt mean you need to shove an AA/M point-defense weapon system on a fucking ww2 carrier..... at least keep some realism... you dont see people building custom ww2 aircraft and strapping sidewinders and AIM-120s on do you now
creations-chat 2021-01-24 12:34:08 <@!200793484053970944> dudes got the cognitive ability of an airdryer

creations-chat 2021-03-27 14:01:21 tbh it is literally just a box
creations-chat 2021-03-27 14:03:40 I don't like it when people post creations (willingly opening themselves to criticism) only to throw shade when they don't get the reactions they want. that's not how it works.

creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:14:13 tail is whack, im planning on re working it
creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:15:59 yeah true, i am going to rework the tail and try get rid of some of those exposed motors but i only really have a problem with the tail
creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:17:58 i mean i will post it after i fix it now that i have feedback, but whats wrong with it being a wip? its not like im complaining i just asked for feedback.
creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:20:54 wack rule the hell

in that case the build is completed, but im planning on editing the tail post completion <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:25:11 but it is completed? i said its done so its done. i just plan on editing a few things. wack rule
creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:28:25 yeah well just decided its finished <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2022-04-28 01:14:56 I think it looks good
creations-chat 2022-04-28 06:47:16 yeah they're literally just signs
creations-chat 2022-04-28 07:14:22 place signs on disconnectors and colour the signs white??? even though its not pc it's doable
creations-chat 2022-04-28 07:21:08 I just said it's not pc
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:22:01 add more to the paint job and that'll be sick
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:25:28 damn bruh I ain't hating I was just dropping a suggestion

 the tan colour seems intentional so I didn't know if you planned on repainting
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:27:20 yeah I feel you some mfs really like to do anything except compliment a build lmao

ion really get why people can't focus on more positive sides of a build with actual suggestions for improvements rather than jus insulting it or smth
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:31:29 you could try add tow cables or smth
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:35:04 I meant on the back above the engine compartment, or above the front glacis

idk just tryna think of things, but I think that if you keep the paint job detailed, with wear, fading paint, exhaust marks, dirt n shit then all those details will come together I feel like you're good
creations-chat 2022-04-28 10:37:16 weathering always looks dope on builds, especially ww2 aircraft and vehicles as they rarely were seen fresh out of the production line, but its your build and if you prefer a more clean newer look then it would still look hella detailed. you're fine either way

creations-chat 2022-04-29 23:12:22 📠
creations-chat 2022-04-29 23:16:22 the colour is supposed to be white, I used a faded offwhite but because its a hover block the light illuminates. anything darker and it would be grey

which I don't rlly want, you physically can't use a "whitish" colour without it lighting up, if it's whitish then it'll light up, that's just how the colour white is. even with very faded whites like I used. I've tried a lot and any darker turns it a weird grey, and when it's grey the light is more obvious as the background of the hover block is darker than the light
creations-chat 2022-04-30 11:15:49 wait yo are you the hars I used to be friends with?

creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:25:57 mfs when people use the downvote feature to it's proper use and don't randomly up vote shit they don't like
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:28:23 W gif
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:32:11 I can understand why u think this server is toxic but mf you literally reposted because your shitty tank got down voted.. the feature is there for a reason. then you start complaining about it like what <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

there is literally kids getting hundreds of downvotes and you complain more than them
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:33:54 no. they didn't downvote because bog did, they downvoted because they think its bad. they just agreed with him
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:36:30 tf u mean oh yeah? yes.. just yes <:m_:778994206948589638>

your original almost got half of the votes as downvotes thats not even good to begin with lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:38:14 bro calls the server bipolar but is the same mf that got mad and left only to instantly rejoin 💀

creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:53:31 German engineering at its finest, just drop the plane in the water and you have a seaborne aircraft
creations-chat 2022-05-29 16:04:09 yeah fax
