general 2020-09-30 21:55:35 i have a ryzen 5 3600x and a 3080
general 2020-09-30 21:55:36 :)
general 2020-09-30 21:55:57 i got lucky
general 2020-09-30 21:56:02 really really lucky
general 2020-09-30 21:56:15 i went for the EVGA ones
general 2020-09-30 21:56:23 they didn't release straight away
general 2020-09-30 21:56:41 does it run well?
general 2020-09-30 21:56:44 yeah it runs alright
general 2020-09-30 21:56:55 i think the 3080 is bottlenecked by the 3600
general 2020-09-30 21:57:22 im running 3200mhz 16gb in XMP (or whatver the amd version is) so yeah
general 2020-09-30 21:57:35 well its either i didn;t get a 3080 or i stuck with the 980ti
general 2020-09-30 21:57:49 rather have a bottlenecked GPU than CPU
general 2020-09-30 21:58:20 i was gonna get a 2080ti
general 2020-09-30 21:58:28 but i saw the 3080 and i was gonna give it a go
general 2020-09-30 21:58:56 already had a 850w psu
