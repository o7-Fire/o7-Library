general 2023-02-16 17:51:03 SEND THIS TO ALL THE SERVERS YOU ARE IN, PLEASE.
This is IMPORTANT

Do not accept a friend request from Tanoshii#0001 He is a hacker. Tell everyone on your friends list because if somebody on your list adds one of them,  they'll be on your list too. They will figure out your personal computer's IP and address, so copy & paste this message where ever you can. He is going around sending friend requests to random discord users, and those who accept his requests will have their accounts and their IP Addresses revealed to him. Spread the word and send this to as many discord servers as you can. If you see this user, DO NOT accept his friend request and immediately report it.
