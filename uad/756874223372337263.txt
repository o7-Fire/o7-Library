creations-chat 2022-03-10 00:19:06 <@!765318482753224704>  I figured out how to make the front of kitt
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:15:22 does anyone have suggestions to make white wall tires for my delorean?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:17:44 <@!792863390392385556>buster123 THE delorean
creations-chat 2022-04-03 18:19:51 i tried to make it to scale
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:13:40 i put the guns to weaponize it like in the movie, and put legacy glass so you can see the blue quill in the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:16:06 well, yes. not exactly proud of that.
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:17:48 im not very good at camera and motor locking
creations-chat 2022-04-11 01:20:37 well, i met a guy named DestructiveLogic, and he inspred me to upgrade my DeLorean and start basic motorlocking, even tho he is on a higher skill level than i am
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:09:46 yea, i know
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:11:33 i recolored it to a picture i saw of a crossover between the ecto-1 and delorean time machine. i have both cars separate, but all my builds get downvoted for some reason
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:17:33 that looks so good! heres a picture of mine
creations-chat 2022-05-01 15:30:17 i also built ecto-1 from ghostbusters afterlife, and ecto-1a from ghostbusters 2
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:14:10 ok you didnt have to say that. i do the best i can because im not very good with motor lock
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:16:10 i'd like to see you try. scale, function, and shape. it was a sh*t show making the DeLorean
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:17:51 i've only been playing for 2 years
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:19:35 well i dont really experiment with motor or camera lock and i keep things basic, but good so i dont have 14 mental breakdowns in one build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:21:30 why are you guys being so mean? i came here to share my builds, get feedback and get positive build reviews
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:23:27 this build uses both motor locking and camera locking
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:25:23 i use exposed motor lock as detail
creations-chat 2022-05-02 21:27:04 no
creations-chat 2022-05-04 20:36:27 ya know what? i m gonna revisit an old build and make a better one.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 20:38:15 i'm gonna remake tordbot from Eddsworld
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:03:47 <@690017479006748791>  sure, i have a DeLorean time machine tutorial if you wanna build that. Warning: takes 2 hours to build
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:05:29 yeah, the video is an hour long and it takes longer cuz u have to pause and build frequently
creations-chat 2022-05-04 21:07:36 well, what can i say execpt you need time and patience to build it. i just record and upload after nonstop building
creations-chat 2022-05-05 22:03:37 thats not a good thing
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:33:02 old tordbot vs progress on the new one (old on the left, new on the right)
creations-chat 2022-05-05 23:35:03 also yes, there is a full interior for the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:41:29 yea
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:43:49 technically its not a repost its just another screenshot
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:45:43 eh i dont care too much. haters gonna hate and i dont have the time or patience to care
creations-chat 2022-05-08 16:47:25 that looks really good
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:05:06 still, i dont care
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:07:44 yeah, so? thats just what i do. my builds may be simple, but thats just how i do it
creations-chat 2022-05-08 17:10:31 eh i figure stuff out as i go on. i met destructivelogic in a server on accident and taught myself simple motorlocking after seeing his complex delroean so i tried to take it simple and maybe in some time from noe, i'll be a better builder

creations-chat 2022-05-08 18:07:30 i'll post my builds all i want
creations-chat 2022-05-08 18:18:47 no lol
creations-chat 2022-05-08 20:06:48 actually ive been playing for 2 years i was just bored and posted half of my builds
general 2022-05-11 23:32:24 i have tordbot, but it moves slow and isnt really built for combat
general 2022-05-11 23:33:26 at least i made it the most show accurate and it has most of the simple features like the chest missiles and the jetpack effect (no, it doesn't fly sadly.)
general 2022-05-15 13:56:52 should i make the innovation security vtol jet?
general 2022-05-15 13:57:13 i made one a while ago but it sucks so i might make a new one
general 2022-05-15 13:57:54 i also made the tank but that kinda sucks too
general 2022-05-15 13:58:39 in innovation security, im a tier 4 guardsman and several points away from elite tier guardsman
general 2022-05-15 13:59:03 oof
general 2022-05-15 14:00:17 i would go to more trainings but they last like an hour and i dont really feel like doing them most of the time, seeing how the server floods 0-60 within like 2 seconds, giving me little-no chance of being able to get in
general 2022-05-15 14:01:13 oof
general 2022-05-15 14:01:27 there are times where i was playing while eating dinner
creations-chat 2022-05-29 02:55:30 yes it is
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:56:37 comming next week to my youtube channel...
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 22:04:25 yikes
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 17:55:09 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcX6aXiKoRE the new rail delorean extension is out now
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:14:35 yeah, it says i dont have permission to type in <#537387160261885962>
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:16:19 why?
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:17:17 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:17:45 im probably never gonna be able to type there cuz i dont have expert rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:20:32 i have 16 plane crazy vids and 369 subs
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:24:33 yeah, im never gonna be able to post my videos
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:24:41 idk how to get expert rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:27:39 well, my builds that look really good get too many downvotes and alot more downvotes than upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:27:49 so yeah.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:28:53 i feel like the rules to post in <#537387160261885962> should be lighter
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:29:28 it should be something like 'as long as you have a channel, go for it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:30:02 well, my DeLoreans and ECTO-1 have quality
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:30:09 and so does K.I.T.T.
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:31:04 it just sucks that i have to post it in <#537387160261885962> or else i'll be considered breaking the rules
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:31:21 the ecto-1 did take effort
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:31:26 so did the delorean
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:31:38 ecto-1 and delorean time machine are both on mk5 rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:31:49 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:32:08 so i can post the vid there?
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:34:19 i did
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:34:26 it got downvoted like crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:35:18 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:35:42 go in <#384025409945337856> and search ecto-1 until you find mine
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:39:14 i tried to hit the colors as accurate, idk how to do the proper wheels, and i just honestly worked to the best of my ability
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:40:23 that usually never works too grat for me
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:41:24 try to build a car
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 20:41:41 maybe not something like the delorean or the ecto-1 cuz those are kinda complex
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:48:35 ok so i think i just invented something
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:48:55 piston suspension
creations-chat 2022-06-22 17:51:09 oh
also among us isnt funny anymore
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 17:53:30 not anymore
creations-chat 2022-06-22 17:53:49 i dont care
creations-chat 2022-06-22 17:55:52 cool

creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:23:59 does this look ok for the front of a 1957 Plymouth?

creations-chat 2022-10-18 21:25:30 ill see what i can do. the flux bands were hard to pull off, or else it will disturb the roof and roofrack motorlocking.
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:47:26 imagine not knowing that it's my tutorial that i modified

creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:10:31 i don't repost. I update my builds and post a picture of the update with an update log included.
creations-chat 2023-02-03 01:53:30 <@813185366017310821>  I already had a 1959 Cadillac so I figured "Why not?" so I made it. I got lazy and didn't really think about it, so I didn't add all the dirt on the car. The engine was tricky to pull off because i couldn't find any good pictures, and the wheels and secondary Cadillac were definitely a challenge.
creations-chat 2023-02-08 21:18:51 this is true. I have the lego set on my desk, and I figured it would be easy to base off of. The interior is also based off of the set. Good eye for pointing it out tho, 'cause I was gonna reveal that when the interior was done.
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:34:02 here's my Ferrari F40. any suggestions?
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:43:08 it was hell to make
creations-chat 2023-03-19 18:45:11 plus on a 7-wide scale, limited wedge variety, and not the best at motor locking, make this harder to do

creations-chat 2023-03-25 01:14:35 idk i think the bot died or smthn
creations-chat 2023-04-15 18:34:24 you're thinking of the wrong car. idk what this is, but I built a Ferrari F40, which is why the license plate literally says 'RARI-F40'

creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:19:01 motorlocking is a fascinating thing. If it's as little as 1 wedge angle off, it can mess up the whole thing and it won't work
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:21:46 yeah. making these upgrades to the delorean was a challange, but  figured it out and everything works and looks good
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:23:52 and making my Ferrari F40 was also quite a challenge but I got it done
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:26:03 i try to conquer both in a build
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:52:00 yeah, my tutorial. It was the first delorean I posted on the channel
creations-chat 2023-04-29 01:56:42 the new delorean shown in the picture is soon to be a tutorial, uploaded as mk4
