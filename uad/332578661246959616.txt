plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:11:58 so uhh apperantly you can reach space
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:12:34 when the stars start showing you're in space
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:13:46 do you have wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:14:36 why are they dots
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:14:51 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:14:55 lol I'm stupid
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:15:06 well time to keep going up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:15:56 I'm pretty sure there's not limit to how far up you can go
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:19:01 is is it possible to build a functioning ship that doesn't require boosters
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:19:37 something that goes forward
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:20:05 and can fly more than 2 inches
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:08 helium blocks+ big rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:35 what did you try to do
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:53 no use super rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:32:22 yea
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:32:32 that's literally it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:32:52 make a huge helium platform
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:33:06 and then place as many huge rockets as you can
help 2018-12-05 01:34:00 how do disconnectors work
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:35:19 no make the platform heium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:35:23 heilum
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:35:32 make everything helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:36:39 no first fill it with huge rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:36:45 then helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:36:53 all of them pointing up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:38:38 make it so you go up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:38:44 when you press W
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:38:46 k?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:43:46 waffle huge rockets are stronger
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:44:44 k fine go with super
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:30:41 nah
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:30:49 there's never enough thrusters
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:31:08 are they pointing up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:33:08 you might also need helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:35:07 what's the difference between delta wings and normal wings
help 2018-12-05 03:27:31 ?
help 2018-12-05 04:16:10 put more weight on the back
help 2018-12-05 04:16:20 or use helium like a cheater
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 23:56:25 I'm pretty sure my planes don't work because I use helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 23:56:41 I should probably stop using helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 23:58:55 oh no
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 23:58:59 kill it now
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:01:29 Aero how do you use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:03:06 doesn't work very well but I'll try it again
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:03:27 restart it
