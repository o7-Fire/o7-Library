plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:54:07 I built a "helicopter" that flies using one

plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:58:17 Its Swedish isn't it
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:58:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:59:12 Its made out of carbon fibre re enforced plastic tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:59:59 Ot looks like a small fishing boat on radar
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:00:59 Doesn't the HMS queen Elisabeth have 2 Bridges ?

general 2021-05-25 17:42:30 Tap 10 times on the dark mode option
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:45:30 Yikes
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:46:04 Who are we kidding most of us are weebs
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:46:59 Ha I'd do more stupid stuff but My laptop is potato
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:47:25 Lucky
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:48:34 Bruh I have an A-10 but I am terrible at making stuff look good
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:48:43 I need to re do it
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:49:37 Idk I just build like car stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:50:00 Nice pfp
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:50:26 Animatic audi quattro
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:51:54 Ugh I'd be able to get helicopter mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:52:11 But I can't post images and stuff
bot-central 2021-05-26 06:53:45 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:54:10 Same
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:54:31 Well mine don't look accurate and they barely work
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:55:06 Subs are annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:55:33 I can never get them to work properly in terms of diving
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:56:01 Its either up or down they never stay still
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:56:52 Yikes
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:57:59 Well I suppose a subs original purpose was for destroying boats undetected
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:59:38 Meanwhile a long time ago
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:00:11 I built a Mercedes unimog
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:00:33 That was proof of concept
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:01:16 Planes are kinda op In pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:02:11 I mean I'm a car guy but I love the A-10
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:02:44 We need logic blocks and sensors
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:03:03 Ah cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:03:35 Yea radar would be nice too
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:04:28 Uea planes that use torpedoes had to slow down massively which made them vulnerable to AA fire
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:05:06 Yes closed system
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:05:39 Yea physics be broke
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:06:01 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:06:52 I wanna make one of these but I can't find a scale that works
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:07:38 The suzuki cappuccino one of my 2 dream cars
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:09:06 Does that work?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:09:33 Is the idea to push the ball into the wall which will propell you forward?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:10:31 Ye a magnet on a rope can be funky
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:11:46 Although making no sense physics wise
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:12:45 F
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:13:29 Imma record my helicopter tonight
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:14:02 Its literally just a giant flying swash plate tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:14:32 I couldn't do pitch on the blades bc pistons aren't reliable enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:14:57 So it just changes the speed of its blades to climb and fall
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:17:51 Have a look at ranks
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:18:00 And rank request obvs
bot-central 2021-05-26 07:20:52 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:47:01 Ik it's hard to see but I built a strandbeest
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:48:04 Basically a set of linkages that turns a circular motion into a stepping one
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:48:29 
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:49:01 Its the mathematics for a strandbeest
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:50:04 Scale doesn't matter because its all relative
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 07:51:45 I'm not gonna claim it to be my work bc it's not but basically if the scale were 1=1cm then the rod measuring 15.2 would be = 152mm
the-dump 2021-05-26 07:57:25 I'm confused
the-dump 2021-05-26 07:58:01 
the-dump 2021-05-26 07:58:03 Old shitpost

the-dump 2021-05-26 08:20:45 Tho I can't decide if its an abrams tank or a challenger
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 08:30:25 
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 11:39:43 Crappy pc stupid good Internet
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 11:40:40 I don't  lag physics just slows down
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 11:42:54 I might make the toyota very high-lux
the-dump 2021-06-01 15:46:00 Anyone who has worked on cars can probably relate
