general 2020-09-22 20:53:34 yeah super easy
bot-central 2020-09-25 05:10:23 -mapsuggest we need the water to not let you sail off the edge of the world, also, a redesigned airport with a proper terminal with jetways and stuff.
bot-central 2020-12-20 01:52:41 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-12-20 01:52:57 ?rhelp
bot-central 2020-12-20 01:53:04 ah
general 2020-12-20 02:05:19 Would the rank for an SSTO be Rocket Scientist or Aeronautical Engineer?
general 2020-12-20 02:05:25 seems like a bit of both
general 2020-12-20 02:07:43 I made an SSTO, so which rank do I request, because it is a spaceplane SSTO which means that I could do rocket scientist or aeronautical engineer, correct?
general 2020-12-20 02:08:14 Single Stage to Orbit
general 2020-12-20 02:09:52 Specifically, the SSTO is a spaceplane so it is a plane too lol so that is where my confusion comes from
general 2020-12-20 02:10:15 It goes to space but also is a plane
general 2020-12-20 02:10:35 Ok
general 2020-12-20 02:11:31 This is what I mean
general 2020-12-20 02:11:43 Meant to go to space but also is a plane
general 2020-12-20 02:12:03 my take on an SSTO
general 2020-12-20 02:12:17 big needle at the front
general 2020-12-20 02:12:22 for aerodynamics
general 2020-12-20 02:12:30 then the back has a ton of rockets
general 2020-12-20 02:12:39 meant to be a passenger craft
general 2020-12-20 02:13:07 like a passenger craft with a ton of space to float around in
general 2020-12-20 02:13:23 IK
general 2020-12-20 02:14:08 I understand there is no air resistance but that does not mean I do not want to make it seem aerodynamic
general 2020-12-20 02:15:24 I might try stratolaunch though
general 2020-12-20 02:15:47 have a gigantic plane carry it up
general 2020-12-20 02:16:07 then launch it from higher up where there is less drag
general 2020-12-20 02:16:16 true
general 2020-12-20 02:16:22 but space shuttles are harder
general 2020-12-20 02:16:33 yeah

general 2021-06-08 03:50:57 do we still have a shredder bug issue in PVP?
general 2021-06-08 03:51:05 just wondering
general 2021-06-08 03:51:14 ah that will never leave then
general 2021-06-08 03:51:30 oh god no
general 2021-06-08 03:51:35 what are the shredder balls
general 2021-06-08 03:51:42 I do not want to know actually
general 2021-08-17 02:08:23 obcpro is screwing around in <#695336597817655368>
general 2021-08-17 02:08:31 lol
