The Tale of superbro133 (256319580543254528)
help 2018-10-21 09:04:27 im just slowly dying inside as most of these creations are better then mine
help 2018-10-21 09:04:50 since theres no real feat in making variable suspension experiments and car-to-boat design
help 2018-10-21 09:04:55 unless i missed something
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:03:26 wotme
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:03:27 huh
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:03:36 i dont even
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:03:45 i can build boats, dont get me wrong
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:03:55 ymetho
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:04:34 <@!294956031153405952> i'll give you a hand drax
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:04:58 say i just thought
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:05:11 what if we made a ramp
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:05:13 and a carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:05:36 and i used my V.S.V (posted in creations) to jump onto it
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:06:07 what exactly is a magnet drive?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:07:01 i see
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:07:50 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:01 how can i tap into this physics phenomenon
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:30 also
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:33 got my first upvote
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:34 yeet
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:13:12 also, if madattak leaves the magnet drive in
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:13:21 it will be lit
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:13:36 because there could be a rank called "quantum physicist"
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:13:37 or something
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:13:41 whenever you use a magnet drive
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:19:01 yee
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:42:47 Can a mod rank me Advanced? https://gyazo.com/dbce5977866ca1af96ca6d8787d28721
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:43:29 oh hold on
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:43:52 https://gyazo.com/694c6015edc1f89545a2fbb67e0b3dfc my first creation here, tried a variable suspension system that allows me to adjust to terrain, equipped with 3 headlight-shaped arena guns
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:43:52 heres the repost
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:43:56 this is why
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:44:17 the gun is on the front and it's not attached to the suspension

plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:28:56 Would a hovercraft count as a VTOL if it used balanced vertical jet engines for takeoff, landing, and height adjustment?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:29:10 actually, scratch that i said that, because it does
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 16:30:42 i cant wait to start working with rockets btw, any advice?

help 2018-11-07 23:09:43 Any tips for designing a VTOL? Do you recommend motors for rotating the engines or specialized 'up' engines for take off and landing?
help 2018-11-07 23:14:18 I was thinking of designing either that or a car that can maneuver when flipped upside down.
help 2018-11-07 23:15:25 Effectively, a car of this design would be able to traverse the currently rough terrain much easier, being able to resist Arena contraptions that are designed to flip a given vehicle on its top.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:17:49 Im gonna make a VTOL, but I barely know how to make a plane. Should I work on experimental cars instead?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:17:55 THis chats mor active so
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:18:02 i figured i'd ask here instead of help
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:18:04 kek
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:20:12 I had a neat idea of making a car that can meanuever upside down and give it some neat combat abilities to dominate the ground.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:21:17 I upvoted, it's a nice design.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:21:37 It appears to be a replication of your standard f16 to me
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:21:44 nice and big, fast flying
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:23:56 One idea that could make it even faster (if these arent already in use) is equipping the jet with Super Rocket Engines and cutting the bulkiness of the craft down.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:24:44 With enough work you could potentially make it achieve the fabled speed of Warp Drive.
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:25:45 Well, I work with cars and not planes primarily (ive experimented with boats and subs) and i have a vague idea of aerodynamics
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:25:50 and im just gonna say it here
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:25:58 if you want to achieve such an insane speed
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:26:17 you need to slip rocket engines
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:26:23 e v e r y w h e r e .
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:26:36 that
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:26:43 and you gotta cut down on the amount of briccs
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:27:02 less bricks equals less weight to calculate meaning it can fly faster and with more maneuverability
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:27:24 hell, if you hollow out some of the detailing (like the center of the jet) you can cram in some super rocket engines
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:28:06 however your plane will most likely need some form of adjusted, more sensitive steering
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:28:14 otherwise uh
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:28:27 you will basically soar off into nowhere at top speed unable to return to the map
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:14 Hmm, first things first
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:27 replace the rocket engines with supers if they can fit
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:29 they are like
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:31 2x2
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:32 or
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:34 idk
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:34 1x1
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:37 oh
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:38 gg
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:29:43 i knew they were 1x1
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:19 also, why not save your old jet as your basic jet
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:28 and give this one a sweet paintjob to reference the fact that it's
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:30 basically
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:36 well, the equivalent of a sports car in the jet world
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:44 like a lamborghini to a honda civic
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:30:59 thats..
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:31:00 hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:31:48 it appears that you have achieved one quarter of the goal
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:31:54 2000SPS is warp speed
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:32:11 Mach 1 is 6860SPS
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:32:22 sizing down the jet could help too
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:32:34 also, i thought of a cool black and blue paintjob for this hyper-jet
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:32:36 sure
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:32:44 lets take this to dms btw
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:33:00 idk if you can screenshare but i can help as you build
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:33:09 and maybe i can learn how to get my own planes off the ground
creations-chat 2018-11-07 23:33:32 k
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:29:33 just a note to everyone who gives a remote shit about me im quitting this game because i cannot assemble a proper vtol, plane, or anything that can take off and fly without crashing and failing horribly
help 2020-04-17 01:52:33 For whatever reason my experimental plane with hover-based landing gear is struggling in the air for an unknown reason, it refuses to stop wiggling up and down despite my best efforts, and I am not quite sure what's wrong with it, it's using two pairs of wings parallel to each other and the lift is fairly centered, it flew straight on my first few tests but the second i added a few tiny adjustments (guns and a trapdoor) it started wobbling, furthermore after reverting the design to before it started wobbling, it still continues to wobble, can someone help me resolve this **C r i s i s**?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 01:54:03 yea
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 01:55:32 y
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 01:55:40 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY*YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY*
