plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:54:29 it was meant to go on the back of a plane but i overdid it a bit and now the motorlock is like half a plot
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:54:53 im still building it though
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:55:05 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:55:11 its not even too big
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:55:49 the scale of it isnt too bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:56:32 yeah but it would weigh alot
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:56:47 i am planning on building 2 of them and making a eurofighter typhoon
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:57:00 im gonna shrink the motorlock first though
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:57:35 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 18:59:17 i can probably make it 2/3 the size
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 19:00:32 yeah i agree
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 19:00:38 its worth it imo
creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:11:00 afterburner (unfinished)

creations-chat 2022-06-07 19:21:26 thats really accurate
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 19:48:42 420
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 19:51:53 ive shrunk it too so i have even more room but im doubling the size though so that its a proper cylinder and it won have gaps

plane-crazy 2022-06-08 17:38:26 because of all the motors all of the trails just start randomly falling and its so annoying
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 17:51:46 https://streamable.com/5zvlns does anyone know why this happens
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:15:16 they are connected but it just randomly falls
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:23:28 thanks, ill rebind some of the motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:49:23 i have now decided that im not gonna build a second afterburner
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:49:29 everthing becomes too complicated
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:52:58 all of the motors just start braking no matter what i do to try to fix it so its too complicated, i definitely could come up with a work around but im not going to because of how long it would take
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 18:56:29 what plane should i put it on
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:16:17 what plane should i put this on
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:18:21 yeah ill have to make do with what ive got left
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:24:11 it wasnt built for being the lightest thing in the world and i can always just put so many thrusters my ears will want to fall off so that it will even take off, if i did a mig and put it at the front of it then its difficult to cover up the bottom of the motors where as if i put it as an afterburner i could easily just use the motors as a detail for the rest of the design, i could do an f35 ***paragraph***
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:29:00 great idea
creations-chat 2022-06-08 19:33:05 i could make a really good burnt looking paintjob on the thing that i made i cant remember the name of the engine thing

plane-crazy 2023-04-05 20:33:48 you only need that much room to do it
plane-crazy 2023-04-05 20:34:05 ill try it
