plane-crazy 2019-06-22 04:55:56 it's eerie isn't it
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 04:56:16 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 04:57:22 The movie 'First Man' makes Gemini 8 look terrifying. Between the overwhelming launch with excruciating noises, and the spinning scene where the rocket spin uncontrollably, it's really creepy
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 04:58:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 05:00:47 ew

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:36:40 I also appreciate your feedback. It'll help me with my upcoming Saturn V launch. July 20th, since that'll be the 50th anniversary. Don't know if I'll be able to wait all the way, but I'll try.

creations-chat 2019-07-10 15:58:55 @Deciduus Sorry I'm late, but Deciduus... yes, I used Movie Maker. lol, I've had Shotcut for a little bit, but in this video I didn't use it.
creations-chat 2019-07-10 15:59:44 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-10 15:59:56 The reason I used Movie Maker is because uh
creations-chat 2019-07-10 15:59:57 well
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:00:04 Narrating in Shotcut is a pain in the butt
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:00:42 I have some pirated copy of Adobe Premiere CS3 and I might want to learn how to use it, but it seems pretty outdated, still probably better than what I'm using now, though.
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:13 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:26 the reason i dont is because i dont have the time to learn it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:51 I spend all of that free-time making rockets instead of learning Adobe, lol
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:53 but yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:02:00 thanks for the feedback

creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:10:08 which brings me to Plane Crazy's largest atrocity:

creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:05 if you dont build rockets, warships, or any ridiculously large-scaled vehicles, then it's not really a problem
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:24 b u t
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:31 if you do then you need a butt load of alts
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:40 w0w
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:52 probably
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:12:27 If the Plane Crazy devs could do it, then they would have by now.

plane-crazy 2019-07-10 20:40:22 the story is
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 20:41:01 In 2015 I thought it was funny to make myself way younger because I thought you could change your age, and that it didn't restrict what you say so much
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 20:41:22 @Pro416, look at you, jumping to conclusions

plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:02 he spent 2-3 hours on a pet hop.
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:03 shop
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:10 The creator of the Purge joined us.

plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:28 but then...
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:46 I accidentally unanchored his whole build which was about to be imported to a new game.
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 04:08:50 it fell to the ground.

help 2020-07-22 03:30:38 it has gravity turn capabilities so i used wing panels
help 2020-07-22 03:30:41 but
help 2020-07-22 03:30:44 that acted as helium
help 2020-07-22 03:30:46 for some reason
help 2020-07-22 03:30:51 and it just wobbles around
help 2020-07-22 03:30:53 i've tried everything
help 2020-07-22 03:30:56 nothing works
help 2020-07-22 03:31:23 ...

help 2020-07-22 03:32:41 im trying to get it flying
help 2020-07-22 03:32:54 so it has gravity turn capabilities
help 2020-07-22 03:33:04 so i decided to use wing panels for stabilization
help 2020-07-22 03:33:10 but they just acted like helium
help 2020-07-22 03:33:15 and made it rock back and forth
help 2020-07-22 03:33:23 i've tried every config i could but nothing worked
help 2020-07-22 03:33:41 the top
help 2020-07-22 03:33:55 WAIT
help 2020-07-22 03:34:00 sorry i read that wrong

help 2020-07-22 03:35:19 or all throughout

help 2020-07-22 03:39:48 when i try to gravity turn (aka steer it) it wants to correct its orientation
help 2020-07-22 03:40:00 and straightens
help 2020-07-22 03:40:16 it wants to always point up
help 2020-07-22 03:40:19 yes
help 2020-07-22 03:40:28 it tries to correct its orientation to point upward
help 2020-07-22 03:40:37 and keeps going up

general 2021-01-24 23:15:10 it'd be cool if there was one surface on a ball that you could weld to something
general 2021-01-24 23:15:36 balls are pretty much useless except for the use of using them as ammo or shit loads

general 2021-01-24 23:18:46 <@!693059154847203328> more than 2 airports, with runways large enough to land comfortably on, a large ocean, while there also being plenty of land, maybe like a desert and a snow area and plains and some mountains
general 2021-01-24 23:18:48 maybe some islands
general 2021-01-24 23:18:57 rocket launch pad in the middle of the ocean maybe
general 2021-01-24 23:19:26 DOCKS
general 2021-01-24 23:19:36 what if there was like a little neighborhood too
general 2021-01-24 23:19:39 idk
general 2021-01-24 23:20:20 it would be cool if the new map had a cool underwater area that you can explore, good for submarines or something
general 2021-01-24 23:20:34 like a coral reef and some caves maybe
general 2021-01-24 23:20:58 yes
general 2021-01-24 23:21:00 water island
general 2021-01-24 23:21:07 make a beach
general 2021-01-24 23:21:20 maybe a volcano
general 2021-01-24 23:21:36 it'd be cool if the volcano erupted sometimes but i could see how that'd be tedious and lag inducing
general 2021-01-24 23:21:58 wait for real?
general 2021-01-24 23:22:16 rip
general 2021-01-24 23:22:27 the new plane crazy rewrite should have multiple modes
general 2021-01-24 23:23:09 maybe better pvp effects, there could be a gamemode where there's like floating rings you fly your plane through
general 2021-01-24 23:23:18 idk
general 2021-01-24 23:23:31 challenge gamemode?

general 2021-01-24 23:26:32 replace rick roll
general 2021-01-24 23:26:40 but make it so you can actually see it without glitching
general 2021-01-24 23:26:52 thatd be pog
general 2021-01-24 23:27:18 oh also if you actually make a new map prototype it'd be pog if you made it public so people can see it
general 2021-01-24 23:27:30 and maybe a speed coil so people could get around faster to look at it
general 2021-01-24 23:27:44 i'm sure people would support it every step of the way and help get it to the real game
general 2021-01-24 23:27:45 pog

general 2022-08-31 19:16:59 and toward the end of the day
general 2022-08-31 19:17:02 he vomited in the bathroom
general 2022-08-31 19:17:03 came back
general 2022-08-31 19:17:11 started to dry heave a bit in the room
general 2022-08-31 19:17:14 and he was at the desk next to me
general 2022-08-31 19:17:18 i fucking booked it out of the room
general 2022-08-31 19:17:30 i ended up having to hold the door open for him
general 2022-08-31 19:17:36 while he clutchedh is stomach and walked into the hall
general 2022-08-31 19:17:40 im surprised i didnt get it

general 2022-08-31 19:18:27 are just
general 2022-08-31 19:18:31 for barf
general 2022-08-31 19:18:31 discussing our hatred

general 2022-08-31 19:18:43 only twice what
general 2022-08-31 19:19:16 i lasted vomited when i was 8 years old (im 15 now) but before that i vomited like once a year or two
general 2022-08-31 19:19:45 what actually gave me the phobia of vomit is my sister got the stomach virus when i was 7 and she was 8 and
general 2022-08-31 19:19:51 she barfed all fucking night super loud
general 2022-08-31 19:19:53 like every 10 minutes

general 2022-08-31 19:21:47 and he came home like nothing happened, he was a huffing and puffing a bit though
general 2022-08-31 19:22:04 and he didnt even tell us that he fucking threw up until after he had been around us for like an hour
general 2022-08-31 19:22:14 and me and my mom both have phobia of vomit
general 2022-08-31 19:22:18 that was right after he had covid too

general 2022-09-10 01:21:52 what so you just want me to pretend i enjoy making tutorials
general 2022-09-10 01:22:02 no im not gonna pretend i enjoy doing something i dont enjoy
general 2022-09-10 01:22:11 ive said it many times and if you cant handle it then just ignore it
general 2022-09-10 01:22:16 i enjoy making showcases yes
general 2022-09-10 01:22:21 but heres the truth, nobody likes making tutorials
general 2022-09-10 01:22:24 nobody
general 2022-09-10 01:22:27 they're miserable to make
general 2022-09-10 01:22:40 only reason anyone makes them is for the views
general 2022-09-10 01:22:44 like mad vulpen
general 2022-09-10 01:22:52 he got like 40k subs from doing shitty tutorials
general 2022-09-10 01:23:13 true but theres already so many good guides that already have a bunch of views
general 2022-09-10 01:23:20 fireyoblivion, namnam
general 2022-09-10 01:23:28 no point in doing the same thing as them
general 2022-09-10 01:23:30 hi
general 2022-09-10 01:23:45 they've pretty much already covered most things to cover within the game
general 2022-09-10 01:23:55 i suppose a rocket guide could be beneficial to the community though

general 2022-09-19 02:28:37 oh nvm
general 2022-09-19 02:29:01 i thought you meant platm the guy who worked on an f14 for like 6 months and it was probably the best in plane crazy and he was about to finish it but his roblox account got terminated
general 2022-09-19 02:29:05 i feel so bad for that guy still

general 2022-09-19 02:29:49 i would probably
general 2022-09-19 02:29:52 be extremely upset
general 2022-09-19 02:29:56 maybe even shed a tear
general 2022-09-19 02:30:22 i mean not only was his roblox account that he had robux and friends and progress in games on just gone forever, but also his builds that he spent months on
general 2022-09-19 02:30:31 when you think about it like that it doesnt seem so ridiculous
general 2022-09-19 02:30:34 man handled it like a champ

contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:36:33 it's ok ig there's only so many ways you can make a build in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:36:45 but i wouldn't recommend doing deliberately that going forth
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:37:03 bro you dont gotta call me sir lol im 15

dumbass kids dont understand that content creators dont wanna give away builds they spent weeks on for free
not to mention the fact that not only would the tutorial take a ridiculously long amount of time and be extremely difficult to make, but the kids in the comments would make a million mistakes and complain that its too hard and doesnt work
creations-chat 2022-09-26 18:04:00 ong, i hate tutorials and i hate making them but the only reason i make them sometimes is because they literally save my channel

and then also the weird ugly golden half block ball thing on the top of the rotor should probably go too

its always annoying as fuck when someone downvotes your build just to do it when they suck ass at the game
half the people who downvoted my donkey copter are posting literal cabbage mobile shit
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:41:15 i mean whats even your reasoning for downvoting it other than the fact that it isnt perfectly roscale
everyones entitled to an opinion but its annoying when someone downvotes a good build just to go against the grain and then they just say they "don't like the build" like dog it's clearly the best that can be done in plane crazy, an extremely limited game
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:43:25 fr man 😭
naw i still understand why people downvoted it, it's a meme build which a lot of people don't like because it's not AIRBUS EMB-747-1080TI 🤓 and it's also not the best quality either
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:45:34 donkey copter most upvoted build in plane crazy in 2 minutes!! <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081> 
also thanks for the compliment
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:47:39 <@910695311675097178> don't take the mass downvoting personally, the PCC doesn't like basic 1 block wide builds
that's good for a first motor lock build and you're going down the right path, it just needs some details and the exposed lock sticks out a lot which there isn't much you can do about at that scale
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:54:34 ok dude i get your frustration but just let it go it's not worth it
also it's not even your build
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 01:57:14 hey i got a question for the camera lockers out there
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 01:57:32 how tf you guys do camera lock in large amounts in small spaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 01:57:35 if you cant motor lock it
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 02:01:28 how else would people do the canopy framing on helicopters
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 02:03:49 
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 02:03:58 where tf you hide the motors

plane-crazy 2022-09-29 02:05:49 but even then like
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 02:06:04 if you dont have the motor right by what you're angling

general 2022-10-06 23:32:00 autotune wasnt invented until the late 90s so kind of redundant
general 2022-10-06 23:32:02 but still true

general 2022-10-06 23:32:45 my friend always tries to get me to listen to kanye west and he'll recommend a song to me and i'll listen to it and highly dislike it
general 2022-10-06 23:32:49 that goes for like every song of his

creations-chat 2022-10-10 14:55:57 <@1004207882784489472> tail boom is a bit too short and fat, rotor housing looks kind of goofy and has sharp, abrupt angles
the jet on the front looks kind of odd too, but everything else is good
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:39:30 <@439829923192897536> i love how you put the <:EYES:525319504721608705>  like you're hyping it up even though it's just some goofy roscale build with bad shaders
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:41:33 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:46:50 fr, im so sick of people putting shaders on their builds in creations to try and hide their goofy ass roscale build's flaws and get more upvotes
and when the shaders are bad it just becomes hilarious
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:49:07 morfix's new hind is goofy af so i am going to have to disagree
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:54:47 its just so fucking funny when people put the eye emoji like they're hyping it up and then proceed to post some goofy ass build
like this is just so hysterical
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:56:52 bro its literally a challenge to make a decent build under 500 blocks

creations-chat 2022-10-11 17:11:17 🤓 🚨
general 2022-10-12 02:51:26 in order to be born, you needed: 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 second great-grandparents, 32 third great-grandparents, 64 fourth great-grandparents, 128 fifth great-grandparents, 256 sixth great-grandparents, and 2,048 ninth great-grandparents-- for you to be born today from 12 previous generations, you needed a total of 4,094 ancestors over the last 400 years. Think for a moment - how many struggles? How many battles? How many difficulties? How much sadness? How much happiness? How many love stories? How many expressions of hope for the future-- did your ancestors have to undergo for you to exist in this present moment; and you want to be a femboy sl*t.

creations-chat 2022-10-23 19:56:19 <@763062253410844702> build blows, but that garageband cover is FIRE 🔥
creations-chat 2022-10-23 19:59:54 i dont think i need to provide feedback for every build i dislike, but since you requested it-- sure

the shape of the tail boom is blocky and inaccurate, the build as a whole could use a lot of detail and some weathering, the external fuel tanks on the wings could be smoothened out a lot either with motor lock or adding signs and disconnectors to each side, the colors seem a bit inaccurate, and generally im just not a big fan of the build

it's not a terrible build, it's just not good imo either
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:47:44 that was pretty good, thats a really nice piano
all i have is a 25 key midi controller with mini keys so i cant really play much but its really fun to play with and its good for basic melodies
and ive also played roblox piano since march and ive played guitar for two years so i think i would be decent at learning piano
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:49:50 its goofy, looks like a mix between the mad vulpen tutorial and my c-130
windshield is too high, the fuselage is too tall, and the nose is kind of strange looking
it could also be a lot smoother
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:51:59 i figured, that piano you were playing on is still really nice even though its not yours
good playing 👍 killed me how you didnt end on the resolve chord though
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:54:05 that makes me happy to know people are using my crappy builds for inspiration 🙂 
like i said its pretty decent but i just think it needs some work
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:07:44 JESUS CHRIST WHAT IS MINTY'S PROBLEM
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:10:22 literally the best f4 in the game and minty probably looks at it and goes "ehhh the f4 phantom is overrated. i don't like the build." and downvotes it
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:12:33 shes legit the bitch of PCC
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:14:36 pcc standards are so scuffed, my fucking donkey helicopter  got 415 upvotes and then the best f4 in the game gets less upvotes in the same amount of time elapsed
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:16:39 ong, what ive tried to tell her is that you shouldnt downvote a build just because you dont like the real thing, you should downvote it if the quality is bad

like im not even a fan of the f4 phantom but theres literally no universe where i would downvote that because the build is gorgeous and smooth and detailed and the camo is wonderful and the angles are splendid annd MMMMM 😋
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:18:44 ive seen her builds, they're not even good they're just goofy
she made some mig 23 that looked like a drawing made by an 8 year old
she is literally epitome discord mod
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:20:56 i didnt have any pictures of it but it was unpainted and all the angles and proportions were ridiculously wack
she claims her builds are "experimental" and "test builds" or something but its obviously just an excuse
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:23:02 used to be a he <:trollface:775024642104229898> but shes been a she for like 2 or 3 years i think
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:25:04 that f4 could get into the hall of fame and literally be the best thing in there, i mean if this thing could get in then the f4 is an easy W
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:32:25 my friend who hasnt finished a build in 2 years just called SR's f4 trash 🗿

plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:17:17 this man is either improving faster than anybody ever has before or he's using sorcery
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:17:28 ok copying is also a valid possibility
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:17:49 obviously the f18 on the bottom pic isnt that great but its like 1,000 levels above the first picture
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:18:42 right but thats a lot more than just advice
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:20:27 yeah its mediocre
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:20:29 but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:20:42 the first one is absolute horrendous horseshit
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:20:50 and the second one is mediocre but decent
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:20:59 and all this happened in the span of like a week or two
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:52:52 WOW ok

plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:54:23 it would take most people at least a year to get to the level you're at now
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 19:54:29 He

creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:39 <@993299330695975002> nice madvulpen copy
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:17:11 lmao it obviously is, every aspect is exactly the same except the paint because copiers never know how to paint their copies decently
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:19:42 buddy, think whatever YOU want but it 100% is-- you can keep denying it, that wont get you anywhere, but you and i both know deep down that you copied it

also judging by your pfp and bio you have clearly been around mad vulpen's f-22 a lot which raises the likelihood that you copied or took heavy inspiration
edit: nvm i got it backwards but you still copied
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:21:45 it doesnt look like a tutorial, but it does look like madvulpens f-22 showcase
also <@993299330695975002> are you a vulpen fan just answer honestly
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:24:41 ^^^
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:27:18 delivery Lol
2. ok you might not be a fan but you still copied him L
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:30:02 wait ayo ignoring the paint the FRONT OF HIS ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER LOL
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:32:51 yeah
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:47:14 look at the engines, the intakes, the gears, the spine, the wings, the aft
a lot of it looks either copied or heavily inspired by vulpen's
i will agree that shiro's f-22 is better aside from the paint, but the livery is ass and a lot of components are blatantly copied from vulpen's
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:55:26 fabric wing panels make it wobble a lot less, so try adding a bunch of those in the nose
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:57:40 WIP f-18 any feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:00:06 it uses rockets because its a 2 wide and hover engines made it too laggy so its slow (max speed is only like 570 😭)

creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:13:25 hover engines, but you need to have a good computer to add them on large builds because they induce lag
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:16:51 a hover engine is just a hover thruster placed facing an unpowered motor (they both face toward each other) and you use the keybinds set to the hover thruster to control the speed
you can stack them and sh i'd probably look up a tutorial though just so you understand
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:20:46 hull shape kind of funny, colors a bit bland, ladders look kind of blocky
but thats me nitpicking, its pretty solid
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:23:43 ~~🤓~~
(jk)
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:31:17 oh yeah that happened because of an error lol it was less steep of an angle before but i made a mistake and that happened and i just kept it because i thought it looked okay
but ill put it back
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:35:55 bro not laggy? what are you on they dropped my f18 from 35 fps to 15 fps i had to replace them with super rocket engines
you must have a really good computer
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:43:09 2019 type beat
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:54:40 you asked for feedback, people give you feedback, and then you just combat it and argue that there's nothing wrong Lol
if several people are saying something then usually something's up
i mean no offense by this
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:03:37 much better
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:05:47 bro it wasnt because it was "unique" its because you copied a youtuber 💀 
LOL HE LEFT
creations-chat 2022-11-15 14:11:19 bro a 186 mph train should NOT be 600 sps lol it should be like 250
creations-chat 2022-11-15 14:13:24 bro i just called it a plane 💀 i really dont know anything about trains
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:38:07 BRO MINTY UPVOTES A MID TOMCAT THAT LOOKS LIKE EVERY OTHER ONE BUT SHE DOWNVOTES SR'S F-4 PHANTOM
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:41:12 (no offense to scout, its not bad it just kind of looks like every other f14 i see)
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:43:26 Fr
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:47:08 surprised she didnt go "F-14 is overrated. i don't like this build." and downvote it
creations-chat 2022-11-15 20:30:50 because its funny, its obviously satirical
builds that are bad but obviously weren't made as a joke get downvoted because they're actually just unironically bad
creations-chat 2022-11-15 21:23:58 who desired
oh
creations-chat 2022-11-21 04:57:55 any feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:09:40 yeah the nose isnt long, it actually looks too short from above whilst looking fine from the side
i was told the issue is that i need to move the LERXS back by a block but the way i set up the motor lock i cant do that 😢
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:30:03 left or right
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:38:16 i liked left more because the shape is a little more accurate and its a little less goofy and skinny looking but all my friends said right because its shorter so i think im going with right but i prefer the look of left more too
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:47:45 yeah i mnot a fan of this shape but the people of Borschuna are going to murder me if i change it back
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:52:20 it became 10% less toxic when edmund left
still has a couple toxic mfs though
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:24:48 he used to be cool but then he just started bullying me for no reason and it got to the point where he fucking started selling pictures of my FEET to people on gaijin
FOR ACTUAL MONEY
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:30:12 1. decent looking custom engine wasnt possible to make, but thanks for the suggestion

2. the elevators, or "pitch wings" as you call them lmao, are actually fine its just hard to see the edges because of the color of the asphalt

3. im not sure what you mean by the ailerons looking disconnected (yes those are ailerons not flaps) but they're literally just control surfaces on the back of the wing so im not sure how they look "disconnected" that's about as solidly filled in as it can look

4. wing length is kind of hard to accurately judge because the canopy is a little too wide so it throws off the scale of everything a little bit, but i see where you're coming from
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:32:43 blackmailed me, i dont really want to talk about it
i was obviously extremely naive about it but i still definitely didnt do it willingly
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:40:16 ah i understand the wing length thing now, you meant width
i'll try to see what i can do about that
still don't understand the disconnected thing
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:06:08 blackmail
he ended up claiming he was "joking" but it was actually a thing that could have potentially ruined my friendship with a certain friend, or at least i thought at the time
i was still being fucking stupidiot though
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:09:11 GAH DUM
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:12:20 (the fool doesn't realize he's talking about the majority of fighter, attack, and training aircraft, and that the slightly overscale size allows for more detail)
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:27:10 no that wasnt a joke why tf would i do that
he said HE was joking later but i didnt KNOW it
and he literally ended up SELLING them to people (what the fuck)
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:35:54 yeah i understand that now and i kind of understood that back then but i was being naive as hell and made a fucked up mistake and let a fucked up person take advantage of me
it only makes matters worse that i literally have midget feet Lol
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:33:16 tf you talking about that shits horrid
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:37:08 there's your problem, you are making a giant anime crystal in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:50:11 bros got so worked up over me not complimenting anime that he got warned for bad word usage LMAO bro was probably like "anime so good you suck you fucking #### i hare you peopl build what the f####ing want you stupid ###!!" 🤓
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:56:50 <@1004207882784489472> gemotry darsh fcube my beloved..
i remember making a 3d one out of paper and tape in 2nd grade and i was so proud of it but then my mom threw it away when i got home and i was distraught <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-22 17:34:54 L
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:06:58 
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:10:08 really messy and bad and too close together, i was just happy that i was able to make gears that properly fold into the engines
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:13:32 retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:20:01 
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:22:02 retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:25:20 there are no others, theres only one on the wheel and then the motor is covered with a grey wedge so only one hole can be seen when retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:43:07 i couldn't because of the way i set up my motor lock
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:45:35 alright then what do you suggest i do, i couldnt do rotated control surface engines because they looked like shit and didnt fit with the smooth style of the spine so i resorted to large jet engines because my friend who's significantly better than me told me to
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:48:02 yeah bro an expert
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:50:33 no, i just sent his f18 which was made less than a month ago so theres no excuse for it to be so bad

also wtf happened to upvotes and downvotes on my f18
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:52:51 yeah i wish i could do that, i spent like an hour trying to but it wasn't possible <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:54:57 alright, putting aside your... expertise... 💀 how do you think i should improve the aft of my f-18, criticism is fine if you can back it up or provide helpful information on how to improve it
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:57:16 well sometimes a build is so fucked up beyond repair it isnt even worth listing all of the problems because it's just so bad and has so many issues, but i don't think my f-18 has that issue (no i'm not implying that my f-18 is perfect or anywhere near perfect it still has a sizable amount of flaws)
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:59:41 because your f18 isnt done yet its really solid so far
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:12:34 you cant react to messages in creations chat, but b-29
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:14:58 j-20 is really just a shitty f-22 and su-57 knockoff though
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:17:05 oh dear i worry for this man.. you're in for a real shit storm dude  <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:24:21 thats understandable, thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:41:49 FR 2 wide f14s in plane crazy are ALL the same
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:45:37 the fact that my f18 got a significantly worse downvote to upvote ratio than my donkeycopter says a lot about this server
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:47:47 darknetwhite try not to screenshot or record your build with shaders challenge <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:03:01 i mean it has some issues like the bland livery, exposed motors, and lazy ass canopy
creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:06:26 oh i thought you were being sarcastic and trying to say that its really good but has shaders which is far from true, only thing i like is that he put the effort into angling the landing gears
everything else i agree with you on
also its one wide Lol

plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:36:27 one thing i dont know why it doesnt even matter how hard you try
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:36:37 last two times i got people to record my builds they lagged for them
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:36:56 but i asked a vip server if my f18 was lagging for them
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:36:57 and they said no
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:05 one person said a little bit but 3 people said not at all
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:12 so i guess it depends
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:17 very slow
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:18 very funny
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:22 max speed 550

plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:37:54 2 wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:38:01 because 2 wide is superior width
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 22:38:48 yeah probably because he doesnt have a $600 dollar discontinued lenovo laptop that he got for $450 on clearance sale with intel graphics

contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:18 the pavehawk is really good
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:21 will probably get like 2nd place
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:28 maybe 1st if the other submissions are all mid or bad
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:37 but i think it like
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:47 ties with artyom's spaceship thingy
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:36:26 this kind of hurts to see because that sharp edge could be easily fixed with a half triangle wedge down
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:36:49 thats just being nitpicky though
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:24 this too
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:37 barely even noticable, thats just nitpicking dude
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:53 literally and
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:01 what do you expect its roscale
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:04 the game is
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:05 extremely
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:06 limited
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:22 there probably isnt really anything he could do about that without piston locking it
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:27 which causes lag
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:41 and he might not be able to fit a piston without it sticking out
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:45 theres probably a reason it looks like that
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:54 not everything can be reasonably done
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:21 the nose on this one is better Lol
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:27 i meant the top one
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:28 Lol
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:18 it looks like you could put a half triangle wedge down there
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:20 but alrigh
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:44 idk what to do for the contest the deadline is closing in and i was gonna make a ch-53 but i couldn't do the stinking nose
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:01 now i'm thinking i might make like a blackhawk or an apache or a cobra or something
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:07 but i don't feel motivated
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:02:32 barney baby ❤️
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:03:42 can you make an exception for the one guy who made a badass apache like 2 days before the contest started
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:04:01 i feel bad for SR Lol

contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:14:27 i doubt i'll be able to finish by the contest deadline but i'm going to try
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:14:49 100% not going to get in the top 3 winners though
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:18:51 even if i dont finish in time for the contest or if it's too mid to make it to the top 3 winners i still need another build to showcase on my channel

contest-chat 2022-12-04 15:00:09 around 2.2 feet but for the sake of detail and interior and sh its easiest to round up to 2.25 feet
contest-chat 2022-12-04 15:00:21 or thats just what i do at least

contest-chat 2022-12-06 05:33:06 either that or nobody's participating 😢

contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:11 not justneut 💀
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:37 dude downvotes all my builds when this is his latest build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:40 💀
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:10 FR
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:24 like theres nothing wrong with downvoting a build if you dont like it
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:36 but when you're downvoting all the good builds and upvoting all the shitty ones that are on your level
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:41 you are literally
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:45 bringing the noobs up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:51 and pushing the good people down
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:00 therefore worsening the quality of the builds in creations
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:15 then thats stupid
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:26 downvote a build if you dont like it not because its good
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:42 if you think a build is good then legit upvote it not the opposite
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:25:30 bro this aint even bad its just 1 block wide
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:25:54 has a couple of exposed motors but its not bad its just not that great either
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:03 like it looks like it could be a namnam jet
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:15 so its just yknow mid but its nothing to argue over lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:21 like he probably couldnt even make that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:43 OH MY GOD THERE WAS A PISTON LOCK FAIL AND I DIDNT REALIZE IT
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:48 im going to Die
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:54 😭
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:06 ok guys just pretend the window isnt too wide
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:37 luckily the other side is fine so the picture of the other angle was okay
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:41 but that one is way more noticable
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:43 morfix
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:49 im in the lead rn because my builds at the bottom
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:53 but his is gonna pull through
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:02 and probably barely beat mine
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:16 i mean i hope that isnt the case
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:22 but it prob is
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:25 king stallion
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:36 similar name though
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:38 and similar role
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:39:02 actually the nose is pretty similar on the sea king
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:39:07 fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:15 theres actually a variant of the ch-53 called the mh-53 sea dragon so
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:27 if someone called it that i wouldn't be too disappointed
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:42 i Love sea helocopte
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:41:43 you probably felt so cool drifting through the air in that thing with the ninjago music

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:12 it looks really fun
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:31 definitely nothing like flying a big fat laggy ch-53 that can barely fly
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:45 m:
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:45:10 then its unstable and wants to flip over Lol

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:45:28 helicopter physics are ASS in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:00 like it make no sense that the more you angle the blades the more it wants to flip over
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:03 but that is the case
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:11 which is why so many people use fake or semi fake rotors
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:21 good advice
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:30 damn bro's bringing actual real life physics into the game
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:35 that's actually a reasonable explanation though
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:57 every helicopter i've made does that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:48:03 unless it's not accelerating lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:21 you so would have gotten into the top 3 with that 😩
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:32 probably the best 1 wide apache
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:39 ofc assuming you add detail
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:53 i dont know why i said 1 wide Lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:21 i thought the canopy was 1 wide but then i looked closer
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:23 and realized
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:24 it is Not
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:38 how tf did you
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:30 yeah that one part
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:35 yeah fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:59 then you're Screwed

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:53:58 very interesting
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:53:59 btw uh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:06 whats the shortcut for that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:08 unicode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:11 sotgiswg
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:24 you can do keypad shortcuts for unicode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:32 i never do it because im small brained
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:39 but im just curious how you got that so fast
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:45 so i assumed you did keyboard shortcut
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:51 rather than looking it up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:34 ok then you have a fast computer because that would have  taken me about 10 seconds
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:43 took you about 4 or 5
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:49 what am i Doing

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:12 if theres something i need that isnt here i just look it up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:15 like "star unicode"

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:58:51 oh i know how to fix tag mode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:58:53 for most of them
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:00 just put "bruh fr" or "dude what" after it
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:02 or some random sh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:05 but those usually work
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:16 and then just size up text so the "bruh fr" goes out of the box
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:35 works like 75% of the time for tagged symbols
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:42 you prob already know though

contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:21:11 and yeah i am winning so far i guess 🤩
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:21:39 gotta say i didnt expect this
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:21:42 yeah fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:21:50 benefits of submitting 10 minutes before it closes
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:28 fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:45 you should uh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:50 i mean to be honest
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:57 just do what you feel like
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:13 it doesnt really matter when you finish a build unless you have a deadline or people waiting on you
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:17 like contest or youtube channel
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:31 on Galapgos
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:44 but if you want to finish it for your own sake but you cant find the motivation
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:07 just try to sit down, put on some music, particularly energizing music, and build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:17 and just focus on one part at a time
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:36 and you'll soon just find yourself building without thinking about if you're motivated or not
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:39 On goose
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:58 yeah fr dude

general 2022-12-23 04:15:36 😬
general 2022-12-23 04:16:06 honestly motor locking kind of made it impossible for old players to catch up to the new standards
general 2022-12-23 04:16:09 its so sad
general 2022-12-23 04:16:19 no way fr
general 2022-12-23 04:16:31 you were a big inspiration to me early on
general 2022-12-23 04:16:40 yeah
general 2022-12-23 04:17:39 but yeah its really sad when i see friends who used to be amazing at the game and quit for a while come back and try to make stuff and it's just not good because of how much the standards have changed due to the cultural phenomenon that is motor lock
general 2022-12-23 04:18:32 oh damn your f18 would be so good if you added some detail
general 2022-12-23 04:18:42 prob better than mine

general 2022-12-23 04:21:16 but that was really cool lol
general 2022-12-23 04:21:25 we legit ended up building pvp toilet mechs
general 2022-12-23 04:21:30 that was the theme
general 2022-12-23 04:21:37 simple times
general 2022-12-23 04:22:05 the theme was actually battle toilets but close enough
general 2022-12-23 04:22:21 i remember tank fish made like some giant ass crazy toilet spaceship thing
general 2022-12-23 04:22:38 he didnt finish and he didnt say a single word but we were all in awe
general 2022-12-23 04:22:58 like everyone just had crappy toilets on wheels or legs that barely worked
general 2022-12-23 04:23:05 fr?
general 2022-12-23 04:23:32 kinda funny you mention that because i literally stopped animating the intro to my next video to talk in here

general 2022-12-23 04:26:18 looking back tank fish's builds didn't age quite so well
general 2022-12-23 04:26:28 still aged better than my old dogshit builds but
general 2022-12-23 04:26:30 Yeah
general 2022-12-23 04:27:16 i recall my old friend made some tank fish giant bomber spaceship thing tutorial and lied and said it was his for months
general 2022-12-23 04:27:20 aramada 💀

general 2022-12-23 04:30:43 oh
general 2022-12-23 04:31:19 honestly because its so hard to making helicopters accelerate well with real rotors
general 2022-12-23 04:31:33 the more you angle the blades the more it tips over when you go fast
general 2022-12-23 04:31:45 sizing?
general 2022-12-23 04:31:55 small
general 2022-12-23 04:32:00 "roscale"
general 2022-12-23 04:32:16 ok so he calling out mini builders

general 2022-12-23 04:33:32 say that to me again 😈
general 2022-12-23 04:34:11 why do you think there's hover engines on the blades
general 2022-12-23 04:34:26 the rotor does work but
general 2022-12-23 04:34:34 there is a few props inside
general 2022-12-23 04:34:36 to help it
general 2022-12-23 04:34:41 because its extremely heavy
general 2022-12-23 04:34:44 thank
general 2022-12-23 04:34:46 btw

general 2022-12-23 04:35:07 yeah
general 2022-12-23 04:35:27 another reason people add props inside to control their helicopters
general 2022-12-23 04:35:30 weight
general 2022-12-23 04:35:37 sometimes the rotor can't do all the lifting
general 2022-12-23 04:35:58 FR its 15 degrees in AUSTIN TEXAS

creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:30:37 also he already literally took a screenshot of my f18 video and posted it in creations earlier which he got warned for, so i already know he watches my videos LMAO
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:32:45 its honestly hilarious
i feel kind of bad for getting him warned but i think he should maybe learn a lesson that he shouldnt copy other peoples stuff and put it in creations
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:41:14 its really good but i think it could use a little more detail and maybe some color variation or something

general 2023-02-04 04:36:24 what
general 2023-02-04 04:36:54 scale isnt an excuse just lower the increments lmao
general 2023-02-04 04:38:06 body shape looks like it was drawn by a 5 year old, neck is too fat, no strings, fretboard is wrong color, bridge looks like a ☒, pickguard look goofy af, and what is that random line in place of the knobs
general 2023-02-04 04:38:18 oh shit thats plane crazy 💀
general 2023-02-04 04:38:24 im so sorry i thought that was roblox studio
general 2023-02-04 04:38:31 ok DAMN
general 2023-02-04 04:38:35 i am a fucking idiot
general 2023-02-04 04:38:43 to be fair if that was roblox studio it'd be dogshit
general 2023-02-04 04:38:50 but for plane crazy that's extremely impressive
general 2023-02-04 04:38:53 how tf did you do that
general 2023-02-04 04:39:37 wanna know how
general 2023-02-04 04:39:43 because im a fucking illiterate dumbass
general 2023-02-04 04:39:46 Lol
general 2023-02-04 04:40:10 i still dont understand how it was possible to make that
general 2023-02-04 04:40:51 i guess its an esquire instead of a telecaster because theres no neck pickup
general 2023-02-04 04:40:58 either that or it's just a WIP build lol
general 2023-02-04 04:41:19 yeah lmao
general 2023-02-04 04:41:48 wait you're SR_BN
general 2023-02-04 04:41:52 you're SR

general 2023-02-04 04:42:27 that was my suspicion

general 2023-02-04 04:43:51 tele > strat 💯
general 2023-02-04 04:44:10 you probably already know that you just based your name around stratocaster because SR haha funny pun
general 2023-02-04 04:44:20 jazzmaster is pretty sick
general 2023-02-04 04:44:32 i dont know exactly what they're good for besides indie rock and surf rock
general 2023-02-04 04:44:45 sticknub appearance
general 2023-02-04 04:45:03 my dad has a fender player strat and i have a squier classic vibe 50s tele
general 2023-02-04 04:45:08 yeah Lol
general 2023-02-04 04:45:11 im illiterate
general 2023-02-04 04:45:45 when people mistake your plane crazy builds for roblox studio builds you know you're doing good
general 2023-02-04 04:45:56 even if the person who mistook it for a studio build is calling it shit
general 2023-02-04 04:46:05 because thinking it's a studio build is just
general 2023-02-04 04:46:07 enough said
general 2023-02-04 04:46:10 the build is Good

general 2023-02-04 04:47:28 💀
general 2023-02-04 04:47:46 like how the cinnamon toast fuck did you do the neck
general 2023-02-04 04:47:49 and the pickguard
general 2023-02-04 04:47:50 and
general 2023-02-04 04:47:55 honestly the whole thing
general 2023-02-04 04:49:58 my guitar
general 2023-02-04 04:49:59 do you approve
general 2023-02-04 04:50:02 but

general 2023-02-04 04:50:04 same guita
general 2023-02-04 04:50:07 Nice
general 2023-02-04 04:50:22 it sounds so good for rockabilly, blues, and early rock
general 2023-02-04 04:50:29 chad honestly
general 2023-02-04 04:50:48 hi morty
general 2023-02-04 04:50:54 got outdated
general 2023-02-04 04:50:58 settled for something more obnoxious
general 2023-02-04 04:51:35 yes
general 2023-02-04 04:52:02 the motors and wing panels and fireworks give it away though
general 2023-02-04 04:52:15 exactly
general 2023-02-04 04:52:23 if it wasnt for that it would look like a studio build for sure
general 2023-02-04 04:52:32 oh yeah and the text kind of gives it away too
general 2023-02-04 04:52:36 plane crazy text
general 2023-02-04 04:52:54 telecaster
general 2023-02-04 04:53:03 looks like someone's first time using roblox studio
general 2023-02-04 04:53:09 but still 100% looks like studio nonetheless
general 2023-02-04 04:53:58 funnily enough like 2 and a half years ago i made a giant telecaster in plane crazy
general 2023-02-04 04:54:01 it looked like crap
general 2023-02-04 04:54:04 i have a video on it
general 2023-02-04 04:55:16 they're the same people that dress up as giant cartoon animals and get turned on by drawings of mascots
general 2023-02-04 04:55:19 so is it really a surprise
general 2023-02-04 04:55:29 <:SleepingShaq:770667421136060477>
general 2023-02-04 04:55:37 so pretty when it sleep..
general 2023-02-04 04:56:02 the tortoise shell pickguard doesn't go very well with the baby blue body though i'm sorry 😭
general 2023-02-04 04:56:16 ah
general 2023-02-04 04:56:19 makes sense
general 2023-02-04 04:56:23 that will look cool
general 2023-02-04 04:56:45 in guitar center i saw a cool squier classic vibe jazzmaster that had a white body with a golden pickguard
general 2023-02-04 04:56:47 it looked really cool
general 2023-02-04 04:57:07 i think it was j mascis
general 2023-02-04 04:57:23 
general 2023-02-04 04:57:25 it looked like this
general 2023-02-04 04:57:26 so hot
general 2023-02-04 04:57:32 played well too
general 2023-02-04 04:57:35 action was kind of high though
general 2023-02-04 04:57:41 to be expected with a trem system like that
general 2023-02-04 04:57:55 jazzmasters have high action that's just how they are
general 2023-02-04 04:58:07 yeah
general 2023-02-04 04:58:24 honestly it's a squier with a trem bar
general 2023-02-04 04:58:29 can't expect it to stay in tune
general 2023-02-04 04:58:39 my dad's MIM strat can barely stay in tune
general 2023-02-04 04:59:11 bro telecasters are supposed to stay in tune really well but my classic vibe 50s tele cant hold tune 😭
general 2023-02-04 04:59:32 the tuners are supposed to be really good though and it has a real bone nut so i suspect that the person who strung it didn't do a very good job
general 2023-02-04 04:59:42 might just need to restring it
general 2023-02-04 05:00:16 i mean let's be honest the people making classic vibe guitars are probably 14 year old indonesian kids making 50 cents an hour
general 2023-02-04 05:00:22 it's terrible when you think about it
general 2023-02-04 05:00:39 fr
general 2023-02-04 05:00:47 it's on par with my dad's player strat
general 2023-02-04 05:00:49 which was twice the price
general 2023-02-04 05:00:56 over twice the price cause we got the tele on sale
general 2023-02-04 05:01:06 and it's like the same quality
general 2023-02-04 05:01:10 except for some of the hardware
general 2023-02-04 05:01:36 the finish on the fretboard is a bit softer so it wears down easily and you can see all the places where i bend when you look closely
general 2023-02-04 05:01:43 and the input jack is a bit loose
general 2023-02-04 05:01:51 but other than that
general 2023-02-04 05:01:58 it's a pretty much equal guitar
general 2023-02-04 05:02:10 when you pay twice as much you do not get twice the guitar
general 2023-02-04 05:02:15 you get like 1.25x the guitar
general 2023-02-04 05:02:39 ah
general 2023-02-04 05:02:42 9s or 10s
general 2023-02-04 05:03:51 i wish there was like
general 2023-02-04 05:03:57 9.5 gauge strings
general 2023-02-04 05:04:17 9s sometimes feel too thin and frail and easy to bend and feel like they're gonna break when you bend sometimes
general 2023-02-04 05:04:24 and 10s are a little bit heavy for me
general 2023-02-04 05:04:28 💀
general 2023-02-04 05:04:40 so i'm assuming you don't ever bend LMAO
general 2023-02-04 05:04:42 11s gah dam
general 2023-02-04 05:04:54 ernie ball or d'addario strings
general 2023-02-04 05:05:01 should have gotten a strat smh
general 2023-02-04 05:05:08 alr
general 2023-02-04 05:05:33 strats are a little overrated
general 2023-02-04 05:05:37 i get why they're so popular but
general 2023-02-04 05:05:50 you can't use the whammy bar without going out of tune
general 2023-02-04 05:06:00 2 of the pickup positions are basically useless
general 2023-02-04 05:06:12 the middle pickup is positioned right where i like to pick so i always hit it
general 2023-02-04 05:06:41 and when you bend the other strings lose tensions because of the trem system
general 2023-02-04 05:06:52 so it's easy to get caught on the other strings when bending
general 2023-02-04 05:07:10 9s lol
general 2023-02-04 05:07:16 fenders come with 9s too
general 2023-02-04 05:07:31 9s are kind of the standard
general 2023-02-04 05:07:33 and 10s
general 2023-02-04 05:07:42 but most guitars come with 9s
general 2023-02-04 05:07:56 the 11s are gonna kill your fingers bro
general 2023-02-04 05:08:09 my dad's strat has 10s and it's already significantly harder to bend in the lower frets
general 2023-02-04 05:08:27 bending below the 7th fret with 10s is already hard enough
general 2023-02-04 05:08:29 i can't imagine 11s
general 2023-02-04 05:08:48 you will NOT!!
general 2023-02-04 05:09:23 oh nice how long you been playing
general 2023-02-04 05:09:34 i started on my sister's old shitty mini acoustic guitar from when she was 6
general 2023-02-04 05:09:40 (she quit after learning like 2 riffs)
general 2023-02-04 05:09:56 but my dad got the strat which he shared with me when i was at almost a year
general 2023-02-04 05:10:14 and then i got my first very own guitar (classic vibe tele) for my birthday a month ago
general 2023-02-04 05:10:21 and i'm closing in on 3 years of playing
general 2023-02-04 05:10:52 i don't feel super happy about my progress though because hardest solo i can play decently is like the stairway to heaven solo or the back in black solo
general 2023-02-04 05:11:15 i can technically do some harder stuff but that's the limit of where i can actually sound good
general 2023-02-04 05:11:40 i know the metallica fade to black outro solo but it doesn't sound that great when i play it lmao i'm gonna need a lot more practice for that one
general 2023-02-04 05:12:46 obviously
general 2023-02-04 05:12:54 i know the whole song <:sunglase3d:1065308030729728122>
general 2023-02-04 05:13:01 oh
general 2023-02-04 05:13:15 for a while i only knew like the first 2 or 3 licks because i couldn't remember the rest
general 2023-02-04 05:13:28 but i relearned it and i've been practicing it almost every time i play
general 2023-02-04 05:13:42 imagine having a guitar teacher
general 2023-02-04 05:14:03 on galapagos.
general 2023-02-04 05:14:17 i elarn BETTER CALL SAUL! intro by ear.
general 2023-02-04 05:14:21 so pro musican
general 2023-02-04 05:14:50 i started playing piano in december
general 2023-02-04 05:14:58 i've been wanting to learn piano since before i started guitar in early 2020
general 2023-02-04 05:15:07 but i didn't have a keyboard to learn on
general 2023-02-04 05:15:14 but for christmas i finally got a yamaha p45
general 2023-02-04 05:15:16 and it's great
general 2023-02-04 05:15:32 and i can guarantee you the reason i actually want to learn piano
general 2023-02-04 05:15:45 is because i haven't been forced to since the age of 5
general 2023-02-04 05:15:54 taking lessons every week and learning classical music
general 2023-02-04 05:15:57 sounds miserable
general 2023-02-04 05:15:59 music should be fun
general 2023-02-04 05:16:02 i did
general 2023-02-04 05:16:11 there's like two licks in the smoke on the water solo that i always fuck up
general 2023-02-04 05:16:18 if you listen to it you'll know which ones i'm talking about
general 2023-02-04 05:16:35 there's another tricky fast lick near the end but i can do that one pretty well because it's simpler
general 2023-02-04 05:16:44 but the first two fast licks get me tripped up
general 2023-02-04 05:16:46 mainly the first one
general 2023-02-04 05:17:01 first one is the hardest, second one i can kind of do, and the last one is fine
general 2023-02-04 05:17:04 fr
general 2023-02-04 05:17:24 you should learn the crazy little thing called love solo
general 2023-02-04 05:17:30 it's not too hard but it sounds sick
general 2023-02-04 05:17:33 and it's not too easy either
general 2023-02-04 05:17:43 YOU HAVE A GRAND PIANO?
general 2023-02-04 05:17:55 or is that a museum
general 2023-02-04 05:18:01 please tell me that is a museum

general 2023-02-04 05:20:16 honestly you have all those extremely high end instruments available for use
general 2023-02-04 05:20:22 you should try learning guitar or piano
general 2023-02-04 05:20:29 so many people would kill for that stuff
general 2023-02-04 05:20:38 don't let it just hang on the walls and collect dust that's so sad

creations-chat 2023-02-10 18:58:25 gjsolo style is basically shitty 2020 pvp jet tutorial lookin ahh plane with cheese grater wings and stabilizers, zero detail, terrible proportions, ugly paint, and exposed lock
(and dont forget spamming rockets and guns all over it)
creations-chat 2023-02-10 19:15:35 lol Yeah
making engines is legit impossible sometimes
creations-chat 2023-02-10 19:18:21 FR 💯🔥
creations-chat 2023-02-14 21:19:30 lmao that'd be like 20 times the length of the map 💀
general 2023-02-22 23:56:13 💀
general 2023-02-23 15:31:14 never have more than 6 in a single hover engine and try as hard as you can to make sure they dont collide with each other when you lock because that causes a ton of extra lag
general 2023-02-23 15:31:43 typically you'll need a few hover engines for a medium sized build
general 2023-02-23 15:31:50 each having like 5 or 6 hovers in them

creations-chat 2023-03-01 15:30:13 💀
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:21:35 first of all
i said that because hes obviously joking
second of all, have you seen your builds 💀 i always see you downvoting everyones builds even the really good ones when literally all your builds are dogshit
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:24:19 yeah sorry bro fr
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:37:12 note: a lot of the builds you downvoted werent necessarily great, but still leagues ahead of what you are capable of doing -- that being said, a lot of the ones you downvote are still good
edit: i have more, gonna post when the cooldown ends

creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:47:33 i know but it just seems hypocritical to downvote good builds when you're actual dogshit at the game and couldn't make something even half as good, i don't usually like the "if you can't do better then don't criticize it" argument but you're just such a hypocrite lol

like by your logic you should be downvoting your own builds cause they're ASS, and yes i see the one you just sent, that is garbage too

edit: WHAT 😭
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:54:26 bro just face the facts the SU-57 is ASS, like if i had the same amount of education, budget, and team size as the people that designed the SU-57 did, i could definitely do something better and anyone could

also its true that most 1 wides suck but downvoting every single 1 wide even if its pretty good for a 1 wide is dumb
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:19:50 god damn justneut out of all people finally said something that isnt insane
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:22:58 how could you say that when this exists

creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:58:21 np just here to make things right
creations-chat 2023-03-01 23:03:20 bro why are people even discussing this, solee's airliner looks like it's from 2020, enough said
creations-chat 2023-03-01 23:05:25 BRO HE HAS MEATRIDERS WHAT 😭 the scottybrother effect.
does it have really mechanically complex landing gears or a decked out interior or something because it literally looks like every airliner from 2020
like it's not horrid but it's surely not good either
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:31:54 how could he mix them up they look so extremely different 😭

creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:43:06 i appear to have been deceived by its introduction date..
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:45:07 look i dont understand how the generation classification bullshit works okay i just saw that first generation is 1940s, second gen is 1950s, third gen is 1960s, fourth gen is 1970s, and fifth gen is 2000s and went by that information not knowing there was anything more to it
do not Kill me
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:56:03 ok so its not about the decade they enter service but the decade they were developed in? then why isn't the f-14 considered a third gen by that logic
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:58:07 you will Never be as good as scottyboo ❌🧢 🗣️
creations-chat 2023-03-02 19:25:09 thanks i know that now
creations-chat 2023-03-02 21:00:14 it's acceptable but i've seen much better, if you can try to use angle lock to make the canopy look smoother, i'm talking about both how the place where the canopy meets the fuselage looks sloppy from the side and how the wedges look sharp and unsmooth

creations-chat 2023-03-09 15:37:26 well it probably was actually well built even if it was cringe af
this one kind of just sucked on top of being cringey

creations-chat 2023-03-15 16:25:10 damn bro didn't know the f-35 was a helicopter

creations-chat 2023-03-15 16:27:33 Hars
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:56:54 same bruh i got so disapointed
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:59:55 yes it would be deserving of at least 50 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:02:56 yes even if there wasnt exposed motor lock it would still be deserving of at least 50 downvotes, you asked a question and i answered it
it has a wooden texture for some reason which looks weird, the wedge work could be massively improved, there's no detail, and the proportions are wack
creations-chat 2023-03-17 00:28:56 it looks literally exactly the same except the new one has worse colors
creations-chat 2023-03-17 01:00:02 motor
creations-chat 2023-03-17 01:41:40 motor lock it in

creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:35:11 that man is a fucking beast, i met him once, that was an encounter that... crashed my computer <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:37:15 put a half triangle wedge on top of the glass, then motor lock a half wedge down pointing in the same direction into the wedge next to it, i always do that on my airliners and cargo planes and it helps a lot, especially when looking at it from a bird's eye view
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:40:35 and if that's hard to understand, here's kind of a visual representation of what i said
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:42:43 under cabin thing what <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
also refer to the image i sent since you don't understand it in words
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:44:45 what are you talking about the cockpit? because i kind of suck at cockpits myself so idk if i can help with that
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:44:36 1 wide with exposed lock and no detail <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:47:19 imma be honest i actually really like this, not because its technically good because its definitely not, but that's where the charm is
it reminds me of back when i used to not get sucked in to trying to make my builds look as good as i could and takes me back to a simpler, more fun time
no it isn't a very good build but it has charm and it looks fun, you should keep it
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:55:27 keep practicing and you'll get better at building, but just remember to play the game for fun, that's the most important thing
also if you're new to plane crazy that's actually pretty good for someone starting out because even though it isn't that good, it looks clean
idk how long you've been playing but if that's true you're on the right path
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:57:55 i don't usually do that i'm typically an asshole in this server but something about that plane touched me deep inside
like you can literally see that 2 minutes earlier i made fun of a jaguar for having exposed lock lol
i think i'm gonna try to start being more supportive and less critical because lord knows this server could use more positivity
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:00:48 i know i know i dont know what it is but it just reminded me of my first few months playing plane crazy and how fun they were thats all
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:03:02 hi vip long time no see
quick question do you remember who you learned motor locking from or did you figure it out yourself
because i remember you showed it to me at like the beginning of 2020 at least half a year before it started catching on
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:07:29 i remember before motor lock we had to use this old piston locking method, which ironically was also taught to me by vipempire, it was most useful for closing the gap between rocket stages
pre motor lock plane crazy was a different world, it's like before motor lock was BC
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:12:10 bro really just accidentally discovered motor lock
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:15:30 i think i found the exact moment it started catching on
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:17:38 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:27:23 dude what that's actually decent 💀 its not perfect but with a little tweaking it could be great
so the nose is a little bit too long, try making the nose a block shorter
also try making the back of the canopy about a block longer
and maybe try working on the colors because they look a bit too vibrant and harsh, almost like default colors (pretty much never use default colors)
and then obviously when you finish you can add some weathering and details like text and stuff, but you've got a solid base

(and what i mean by making the back of the canopy longer is adding a custom angle that's 3 blocks long to the back of it and make it glass material)
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:29:59 what? i dont think you would, you'd just probably have to turn the half wedge down 1x2 on the nose into a normal half wedge down and make the lock angle on the nose 2 blocks long so that it'd be the same length as a half wedge up 1x2
creations-chat 2023-03-19 14:26:35 honestly those shaders look kind of crap, it looks better without shaders
creations-chat 2023-03-19 14:30:44 fyi: the bloom on the shaders are way too high and so are the contrast, vibrance, and reflections
all of these things make it hurt to look at and are generally not aesthetically pleasing; if this is your taste and you like it, then cool, but you did ask for our opinions and this is mine, so take it into consideration
also on a sidenote, 4 hours isnt really much in plane crazy, most good builds take several days of consistent work, perhaps even a few weeks

general 2023-03-21 15:54:25 when was the last time someone posted a good rocket in creations
general 2023-03-21 15:54:49 boxness try not to be a weeb challenge furry
general 2023-03-21 15:54:52 fr
general 2023-03-21 15:54:56 bring back rockets
general 2023-03-21 15:55:08 literally everyone used to make rockets and then motor lock seemed to have kind of killed them off
general 2023-03-21 15:55:17 ya
general 2023-03-21 15:55:26 you see i stopped when everyone else stopped
general 2023-03-21 15:55:29 i am a Sheep
general 2023-03-21 15:55:48 this was the last rocket posted in the pcc 💀
general 2023-03-21 15:56:28 i wouldnt say its hard to make a rocket that looks good (excluding interior) its just so god damn hard to make them fly right
general 2023-03-21 15:56:43 and most of the people that build rockets dont even make them gravity turn they just go straight up
general 2023-03-21 15:56:46 helium mfs
general 2023-03-21 15:56:50 yeah fr
general 2023-03-21 15:56:56 hi genty bab
general 2023-03-21 15:57:15 ive made the gemini a couple times before
general 2023-03-21 15:57:17 its not easy
general 2023-03-21 15:57:31 that was before i discovered angle lock though
general 2023-03-21 15:57:33 so
general 2023-03-21 15:57:43 angle lock probably makes the gemini way easier
general 2023-03-21 15:57:57 because of the messy engine struts
general 2023-03-21 15:58:05 and the service module
general 2023-03-21 15:59:24 damn my f18s kind of dogshit
general 2023-03-21 15:59:37 now i remember why i havent built anything in over 3 months
general 2023-03-21 16:00:18 its not bad but its definitely not that good either
general 2023-03-21 16:00:31 i think it just got upvoted to heck because it was the last build in creations before...
general 2023-03-21 16:00:35 the hyperbitch incident
general 2023-03-21 16:01:12 and the combination of the spineless new players that think everything is good and the people who are desperate to see a build that isnt dogwater
general 2023-03-21 16:01:19 it just got a lot of upvotes
general 2023-03-21 16:01:32 i upvoted it and i dont think its that good its just it doesnt physically pain me to look at like 99% of the other builds
general 2023-03-21 16:02:03 so true
general 2023-03-21 16:02:28 just realized theres a new contest woooOOO
general 2023-03-21 16:03:01 ive never played clash of clans <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-03-21 16:03:35 what is bro saying
general 2023-03-21 16:03:43 not everyone has a good computer
general 2023-03-21 16:03:49 vanilla pc W
general 2023-03-21 16:03:52 vanilla plane crazy W
general 2023-03-21 16:04:30 this was probably honestly the last decent rocket posted in creations
general 2023-03-21 16:04:32 and thats from october
general 2023-03-21 16:04:51 it isnt even that good it just isnt dogshit
general 2023-03-21 16:06:08 yeah it has a pretty decent interior with angle locked panels and stuff
general 2023-03-21 16:07:09 oh damn this is actually really good
general 2023-03-21 16:07:32 obviously
general 2023-03-21 16:08:06 no bro i spent a month or two building a soyuz module in roblox studio and that has almost all of the main details
general 2023-03-21 16:08:18 and the solar panels arent too bad
general 2023-03-21 16:08:23 not sure why he chose wooden texture though
general 2023-03-21 16:08:30 for the solar panels
general 2023-03-21 16:08:33 that looks a bit weird
general 2023-03-21 16:09:12 i cant even spawn like half of my builds
general 2023-03-21 16:09:16 either that or it just isnt worth the effort
general 2023-03-21 16:09:20 because they lag and look bad anyways
general 2023-03-21 16:09:26 i still have potato laptop
general 2023-03-21 16:10:11 honestly miner is fr on some different shit
general 2023-03-21 16:10:39 miner is literally a god

general 2023-03-21 16:11:02 nobody will ever be as good at rockets and launch complexes as he was
general 2023-03-21 16:11:08 even his builds from 2 years ago are still godly
general 2023-03-21 16:11:25 my builds always age like milk
general 2023-03-21 16:12:28 i need to shit someday
general 2023-03-21 16:19:19 how is it even possible to build something that big
general 2023-03-21 16:20:02 damn and he probably used three accounts for this
general 2023-03-21 16:20:08 ik ik
general 2023-03-21 16:20:16 how do you like
general 2023-03-21 16:20:25 have more than two accounts

general 2023-03-21 20:08:28 yeah it looks mid af but its still better than that tank by a tenfold
general 2023-03-21 20:08:55 ive never played flightpoint but i dont think its mid
general 2023-03-21 20:09:27 it looks like the physics and flight mechanics are kind of poop but you can make builds that look roblox studio level
general 2023-03-21 20:09:36 so thats a W in my book
general 2023-03-21 20:09:46 also chiseled cheese isnt unde

general 2023-03-21 20:10:08 since when did he do a face reveal
general 2023-03-21 20:10:38 when i was 13 i sounded similar to how he does
general 2023-03-21 20:10:41 hes simply a late bloomer

general 2023-03-26 04:27:42 Hello, PCC. This is your speaker, Joman. As you can see, I am posting in creations. This is because I am superior as a member of PCC. Anyway, this is my Kippykuro Mach 2, also known as "KIPPYSMASHER". Anyway, my second message is to downvote the plane above this post. 600 upvotes is ridiculous, please downvote it immediately.

general 2023-03-26 04:36:14 I deem this statement as BLASHPHEMY. Such a mere peasant as you living an inconsequential, unfulfilling, and untruthful life has absolutely No warrant to speak further on this matter, especially words of such hate and deceit.
general 2023-03-26 04:36:43 The power of JomanKujo is simply too great for your smooth brain to comprehend
general 2023-03-26 04:36:55 but how can i blame you
general 2023-03-26 04:37:06 Joman is immortal, his strength is inhuman, and so are his capabilities
general 2023-03-26 04:37:51 it would be futile to even attempt the unfeasible task of comprehending the great power of Joman
general 2023-03-26 04:39:00 Our great lord will be ready to accept you into his humble religion when you are ready
general 2023-03-26 04:39:09 but you are clearly not prepared to experience JomanKujo yet.

creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:11:39 now i understand why you have "monkey" in your name, bro literally has a monkey brain, none of you eskeline meatriders know wtf a joke is holy shit

creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:26:12 kindergarten level insults fr
also you say that about him not being able to finish it because you'll never know what it's like to actually put time and effort into a build <:squam:801278498156183562>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:28:16 expert designer is the highest rank you have you legit cannot diss him for that 🧠
also he may have an anime pfp but he's proved himself to have 10x the amount of common sense that you and your little brother Harry have just by two messages
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:30:24 HARRY DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE dumbledore said calmly
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:35:32 lmfao we could make a play, someone call up shakespeare 🔊
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:37:36 you're not gonna wanna hear this but me and jeff are both contest winners, which means that we have a say in which builds go into the hall of fame <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
(and not to sound egotistical, but this also means that we have proved to have building skills good enough to win a contest, so you and your goofy little twin tailed plane cant really be saying shit)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:40:47 better, right, let's see him win a contest or post literally any build that gets over 200 upvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:43:13 and that is a great compliment to me because jeff's ship is really good so far, the issue here is that you think that eskeline is some god at plane crazy which is delusional (and i get it, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but come on man)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:45:53 admittedly i'm not the best builder and i don't build very often, but you gotta keep in mind that i was banned in this server for over a year until i was unbanned in september, which means that an entire surplus of a year's worth of my builds didn't get posted
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:48:04 actually it's a legacy hornet 🤓 but i appreciate the compliment even though i wasn't very happy with how it turned out
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:53:12 you dont understand that builds with tons of motor lock angling and piston lock are difficult to spawn in, especially when you factor in the lag caused by these builds and the glitching of motors
of course your builds are easy to spawn in because they're tiny, have no detail, and are probably like 150 blocks as opposed to jeff's build which is unfinished and already probably over 2000 blocks
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:55:25 damn that improvement CRAZY 🔥
my compliments to your drive 👏
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:57:27 i know how it is brother, its tough 😔 especially having a budget lenovo laptop that runs the game at 15-20 fps when i spawn in a build with a lot of piston lock
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:59:32 get good? my brother in allah, getting good in this game IS using techniques like angle locking, folding, and piston lock
if you keep playing the game and improving for a few years like we have you'll understand, but hopefully you won't waste 4 years of your life on a roblox game like i did
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:01:35 in a year im projected to have enough money from youtube to get myself an MSI sword with an RTX 3060, 1 TB SSD, an i7 processor, and 16 GB ram which are all pretty mid-level specs so i'll finally be able to do other things than just roblox videos and finish videos faster because davinci resolve won't be running at 5 fps <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:12:16 yeah one that can handle literally anything that isnt roblox or minecraft
having a decent computer opens the doors for so many things
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:15:37 bro REALLY trynna put down GAMESLAYER

creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:31:25 OH MY GOD IT'S LORD JOMAN

Joman solos 🔥
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:33:51 JOMAN POPPING OFF 🗣️🔥💯
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:35:54 bro think he superman without the super 🤣
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:37:57 absolute DUMBASS 🔥 you're using "you're" incorrectly, in this context "your" was 100% correct ❌🧢
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:40:00 common joman w, i would expect nothing less from the representative of the plane crazy community
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:42:04 my man why you keep using the word "captivated" incorrectly, just listen to joman and redeem yourself by turning to the sacred Holy Jomanism
general 2023-03-27 21:42:25 im proud of this community
general 2023-03-27 21:42:46 
general 2023-03-27 21:45:00 he had a big ego and people started arguing with him and more and more people got dragged in and it turned into a hilarious shitshow
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:46:18 dude you talk the talk but can you walk the walk? at this point i'm scared for you, have you seen what joman is capable of? he bypassed the closure of <#384025409945337856>, one day he's gonna punish you for your sins and you will be sorry
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:49:20 tech, tell him, joman's wrath is real shit
<@584060481522761728>, i used to not believe in joman either, until i truly experienced his might, now i am a faithful Jomanian and you should become one too
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:51:47 HE DON'T MISS HE DON'T MISS
love that guy
<@584060481522761728>  my recommendation for you is to check out Joman's powerful speech during the great creations channel famine
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:53:55 oh shit dude you okay?
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:57:21 he's not mocking a tragedy he literally just built an aircraft that holds historical significance
i will say it is horseshit but he's still not mocking a tragedy <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:00:11 i know what kamikaze is dude i'm just saying him building a suicide bomber from WWII isn't mocking what happened, you must have horseshit for brains 👍
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:02:21 that isn't mocking the event silly that's just adding details that make it more historically accurate, have you ever been to an airshow or a WWII museum?
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:04:29 goodbye king joman 👋
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:06:34 please learn the difference between "You're" and "Your" you're making an ass of yourself (although i don't blame you because they don't teach that in kindergarten)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:08:43 no it started way before that, eskeline was basically just being egotistical and had some little meatrider sidekick bullying people and saying eskeline was better than people who are actually objectively much better at the game than he is
i have a $500 laptop and i was just saying that i was gonna buy a better one when i got enough money from youtube and he tried to make it seem like that's an unreasonable decision
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:11:54 when your comment gets deleted in creations chat and you have to wait 2 minutes to post again <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:14:01 yeah at least he understood what a joke was, he was just way too obsessed with eskeline for some reason
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:20:17 caught you downvoting a joman build once
nice try
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:38:00 why are you posting this in creations chat
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:40:22 i havent been unde for 3 years <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:55:30 no but its true though all of my shoes are under $60 and work just fine
(all of my 3 pairs of shoes)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:57:36 who the FUCK cares about trends 🔥 if you judge someone for not wearing $200 dollar trendy shoes then you need to reassess your life
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:59:48 when your feet 🦶 stop growing you can keep the same shoes for several years

general 2023-03-30 05:21:44 anything thats addictive and detrimental to your health i do not approve of
general 2023-03-30 05:22:39 because you're just destroying your lungs and wasting money over something that stinks and isn't even that enjoyable

general 2023-03-30 05:30:34 i did it to TheSecretSpy and hes still mad at me
general 2023-03-30 05:31:18 honestly dont understand the no pork thing in islam
general 2023-03-30 05:31:43 like it made sense a long time ago when pork poisoned people so they felt like they had to get people to stop eating it by saying god said not to
general 2023-03-30 05:31:52 but like times are different now and you wont literally die from eating pork
general 2023-03-30 05:31:57 lol
general 2023-03-30 05:32:11 i deadass dont eat pork though it nasty
general 2023-03-30 05:32:36 TRUE
general 2023-03-30 05:33:16 yeah fr steak and chicken are way better than pork
general 2023-03-30 05:33:27 bacon is only type of pork i like
general 2023-03-30 05:33:34 and i dont even like it THAT much
general 2023-03-30 05:33:35 its just
general 2023-03-30 05:33:38 you know

general 2023-03-30 05:33:44 still rather have brisket though
general 2023-03-30 05:33:45 like fr
general 2023-03-30 05:33:57 beef is just superior to every other meat in every way
general 2023-03-30 05:34:12 fried chicken is a close second but
general 2023-03-30 05:34:18 i mean come onm
general 2023-03-30 05:34:20 brisket
general 2023-03-30 05:34:21 steak

general 2023-03-30 05:34:43 then do it
general 2023-03-30 05:34:56 vinegar peanut butter lemon pepper chicken
general 2023-03-30 05:35:18 Lol
creations-chat 2023-03-30 05:36:21 i dont think it counts as NSFW in this server because theres no nudity or anything thats overtly shrekshual its just an anime girl wearing revealing clothing (still cringe as fuck)
general 2023-03-30 05:39:15 fishing boring af
general 2023-03-30 05:39:50 fishing is boring you deadass just sit there and wait for a fish to bite, which usually never happens
general 2023-03-30 05:39:55 but on the off chance it does
general 2023-03-30 05:40:09 you either have to make the choice to release it back, bleeding and suffering
general 2023-03-30 05:40:10 or take it
general 2023-03-30 05:40:11 kill it
general 2023-03-30 05:40:13 and eat it
general 2023-03-30 05:40:19 which is a whole other process
general 2023-03-30 05:40:32 yeah whatever bullshit
general 2023-03-30 05:41:09 and im gonna be honest
general 2023-03-30 05:41:25 fish dont even taste good unless it's done really well by a professional
general 2023-03-30 05:41:30 and most people aren't professionals
general 2023-03-30 05:41:38 fish is just ass imo most of the time
general 2023-03-30 05:41:42 i very rarely like fish
general 2023-03-30 05:42:18 👍
general 2023-03-30 05:42:57 oh no are you gonna block me i've talked to you more than once 😭
general 2023-03-30 05:44:46 that is super annoying to deal with ong
general 2023-03-30 05:44:54 i dont really know how to handle it when that happens to me
general 2023-03-30 05:45:14 i usually end up chatting with them in an attempt to be nice
general 2023-03-30 05:45:18 and then they get the wrong idea
general 2023-03-30 05:45:22 and think we best friends
general 2023-03-30 05:45:26 when we arent
general 2023-03-30 05:45:34 and then i feel bad
general 2023-03-30 05:45:40 and end up just ignoring them after that
general 2023-03-30 05:45:41 lol
general 2023-03-30 05:46:25 theres probably at least 4 or 5 people who think they're friends with me when they aren't
general 2023-03-30 05:46:31 and it's really sad but like

general 2023-03-30 14:58:00 i have a build with 425 upvotes but i know i would be insane to even think about asking for it to undergo HOF voting because its a meme build
general 2023-03-30 14:58:09 so same should probably go for you
general 2023-03-30 14:58:17 think about why your builds have upvotes
general 2023-03-30 14:58:28 if its because its funny or its a meme build then it's most likely not going to get HOF
general 2023-03-30 14:59:32 yes

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:19:29 you say that but you used "it's" incorrectly, when in that context, it should have been "its"
i can tell you're 11 years old and use proper grammar to make yourself seem smarter when instead, it makes you look like a fool
i know because me and many others did the exact same thing at that age
creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:23:54 <@767464181938126849> bro you downvoting this but you make 1 wides that look like BOOTYHOLE 🍑 what is your Problem 🗣️🔥

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:28:33 it'd probably have 300 upvotes and 13 downvotes if it was fully finished and fully detailed, unfinished builds never do well because... well they aren't finished, but as a start it's probably already one of the best fronts of an f15 in plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:56:34 aint no way you actually tried
creations-chat 2023-04-01 23:44:44 they use pistons to extend parts of the build

honestly it's a good build but it is not deserving of HOF, i only upvoted it because we need a new hof build and the hof standards need to be somewhat reachable

creations-chat 2023-04-12 13:52:12 for decent builds real criticism is very helpful but when there's just too many problems with the build to count and it just looks ugly as hell there isn't a whole lot you can say besides "it looks like shit" because going into everything that's wrong with it would take a school essay's worth of words
creations-chat 2023-04-12 14:11:23 this your f18? 💀
I'll take slow laggy f18 that looks decent over a fucking 1 wide goofy ass mf with shaders
creations-chat 2023-04-12 14:14:41 true, however, im lazy as fuck so i dont work on my builds that much so the actual time i spent building was probably like 12 hours
(i am still a slow builder)

nahh who tf puts LGBTQ flags on their builds 💀
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:09:16 his ships arent too bad its just he keeps posting the same shit and putting LGBT flags all over his ships (for literally no reason)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:11:33 yeah exactly
that and the fact that he keeps posting the same ships over and over with 240p videos from the roblox launcher is also annoying
but like i dont have anything against LGBTQ people its just putting that shit everywhere and in places it doesnt belong is kind of annoying
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:13:38 nah bruh it's like if i put an american flag on a japanese ship that'd just be stupid af, it has nothing to do with the build and it's just cringe 🗿
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:16:54 ok ig you're right
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:18:58 okay maybe the colors on a flag do matter <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:00:23 see you thought he was defending you but hes just toxic to everyone besides the 9 year olds that simp for him for no reason <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> hopefully you can see why nobody likes eskeline now
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:04:21 nah bruh lookin through your message history in creations chat and you basically just argue with anyone and everyone in here
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:06:33 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:12:37 i actually agree with this, like i dont care if you like men or women or trans people or nonbinary people its just kind of been shoved in everyones faces for years and im a little bit tired of it
like i know this is different because of historical context but what if i went around everywhere advertising that im straight for no reason and putting straight flags all over my stuff and being like "im straight and im proud" people would be like "ok??" and they'd rightfully be annoyed probably
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:15:13 to be fair eskeline didnt start this one he just joined in with some bad takes, it started with themorfix telling fonnefox to delete his ship and then i joined in and made the argument bigger so this ones actually on me lol im sorry guys
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:20:26 <@407347404858458123>'s builds in a nutshell
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:25:50 agreed
like it's not that big of a deal but it's still a bit obnoxious and cringe
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:28:12 i just realized that the texas flag is like 1/3 polish flag
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:30:21 ok literally when did he say that 💀
this isn't the same thing as that, it's just most people aren't that loud and obnoxious about their segtuality, doesn't mean you have to stay in the closet and never talk about it and be ashamed of it, he's just saying the nonbinary and trans flags on your ships are extremely irrelevant to the build and come across as obnoxious because of that
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:32:24 good point, i just wanted to voice my opinion and that started an argument that i haven't backed out of yet because it's entertaining Lol
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:35:27 you don't have to incorporate flags that represent your segtuality into all of your builds like a watermark so that people know people like you play the game though 💀 it's a building game segtual diversity literally doesn't matter, i just don't understand why so many people are so loud and obnoxious about their beliefs
and this doesn't just go for the LGBTQ community either, it goes for a lot of things, that's just one of the big examples
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:37:29 think about this, do i have to put texas flags all over my builds to let people know that texans play plane crazy? no, most people dont even think about whether or not texans play plane crazy, and to be frank it doesn't matter in the slightest
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:39:34 so anyways keep doing it if it makes you happy, that's just my opinion about it
that's all i have to say on the matter
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:41:37 bro just because creations isnt filled with LGBTQ flags doesnt mean that LGBTQ people arent allowed to post their plane crazy builds 🗿nobody cares about your segtuality, it just doesn't have anything to do with the game
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:46:40 that makes a lot more sense than what you said earlier, again keep doing it if it makes you feel represented, it's just your earlier reasoning was kind of wack
and yeah people are still gonna think it's obnoxious and that won't change but you don't have to stop if you're willing to deal with the criticism and harassment (and it's kind of sad that that's how it is, but most people think it's cringey to plaster something that irrelevant to the game on your builds)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:51:55 alright well i guess you can call being tired of having LGBTQ material shoved down your throat in places it doesn't have any relevance to "homophobia/transphobia"
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:54:20 W response
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:56:34 what? dawg your point don't even make any sense, the nonbinary and trans flags are literally pride flags and that's a fact not an opinion
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:00:14 yeah that's how eskeline is
i think i'm just going to remove myself from this argument because it's become redundant and you've made some decent points
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 16:00:31 hi

You're not even a part of the argument you just said a few stupid things directed at me that didn't make any sense and called it a W
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:06:21 i love how everyone just collectively agrees that eskeline is braindead and instigates conflicts for no reason with points that make zero sense

its true that a lot of whitenames stink at the game or are undes but i dont make hating whitenames and using the trollface emoji my whole personality, unlike eskeline (he literally has like two designer ranks when he isnt even that good at building and thinks that somehow makes him entitled to shitting on whitenames)
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:00:30 i feel you, i joined the server in 2019 and got banned in may 2021 but they gave me another chance in august 2022 so it says i joined in august <:nooo:787097964946259978>

im definitely no master builder myself but come on bro 💀
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:23:09 your build vs my build, your take is Ass
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:27:57 my upvote ratio is better, also that particular build doesnt have that many upvotes because it already won the contest so most people had already seen it
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:30:05 i dont usually do that but i had to do it for the front gear because there was literally no room in the front, incorporating the front landing gear was a tricky task and it wouldnt have been possible had i not used text without sacrificing the avionics and interior
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:34:15 joke build, come on bro you know better that's hitting below the belt
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:36:42 there was a huge argument because he claimed that THIS was better than this (this mf's delusionality and ego is insane)
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:42:46 peak pcc pettiness
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:44:52 window frames, still dont use legacy glass for that
if you feel the need to include window frames, then use angled trails or delta wing panels if you have to
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:46:58 i feel like that perfectly describes eskeline, chaotic neutral
hes just an ass to everyone but his arguments have no real value so he doesnt actually choose sides he just insults the people he doesnt like even if it isnt relevant to the argument
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:49:17 because he sucks, hes hypocritical, hes bad at building yet he acts like hes the best builder in the world, his arguments are bad and have no real value, and he makes shitting on whitenames and using the troll emoji his entire personality

creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:37:28 NAHHH BRUH toxeed tutorials were always trash even in 2019, i remember my first rocket in early 2019 was loosely based off of his rocket tutorial (the design was different but i applied some of the same concepts) and it looked and flew like 5x better than his, bro had no right to be making tutorials
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:40:15 damn bro she a baddie show more angles 😍
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:42:17 pretty much every part of it is laughable, if you're a new player it's not a bad start so i congratulate you but you definitely have a lot of learning and practicing to do to catch up with the current standards
general 2023-04-30 03:42:47 hi what
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:49:28 man thats pretty detailed, i dont really play build a boat for treasure so thats impressive to me, but yeah dont worry about it just have fun and if you want your builds to start looking good then practice more and try to make them look more like the blueprints you look at
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:27:34 something to keep in mind is that most seasoned jet builders add window frames to their canopies to make it look better and more accurate to the real aircraft, and if you intend to add window frames then you can't really make the canopy open which is a sacrifice most people are willing to make

(not to mention if the canopy has any angle lock at all you cant make it open)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:32:47 sounds like the worst decision you made because your builds look mid af Lol 
NVM the fact that your mechs can run is really cool and impressive i couldnt do that (still look mid though)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 17:22:58 dont know how to build? gam3 has had consistently good builds for years, always matching the plane crazy building standards and is a well respected member of the community
you are some punk ass whitename with an inflated ego because your mid ass mech is able to run (which is cool, but it still looks mid)
i Think he might know a little better than you

creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:27:40 bro do you really have to reply to everything i say in creations chat
(ok after looking it does appear to be basically reposted but with a couple of improvements, which technically means that the old one was WIP which aren't allowed in creations, but i still like it and i don't tend to immediately start checking to see if a creation i like is a repost)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:29:59 👍
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:32:08 LMAO bro thinks that you going brb for a moment is him winning the argument 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:21:55 you literally just copied the fuselage of just rens's mig-21 and slapped crappy sweeping wings on it 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:24:03 i like it it's not the best build i've ever seen but it's creative and refreshing and fun
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:26:10 okay my bad it definitely doesnt look identical but theres a lot of similarities and that would explain why the fuselage looks decent but the wings look terrible (not saying you copied it anymore though, upon further inspection the similarities are surface level and limited)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:30:53 so for the inward part of the wing that doesnt rotate, the angle on the back is inaccurate and should look a little more like the way i drew on it, also the gap is a little bit too big
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:33:11 so upon closer inspection (again lol) your wings arent as awful as i initially thought they were compared to the blueprints, the su-22 is just really ugly (what i said before still holds up though)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:35:36 if you can yeah, the back angle of the inward parts of the wings is inaccurate and the gap between the rotating part and inward part is a little bit too big, maybe change that from a 1x2 delta wing to a 1x1 delta wing
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:37:47 so basically try to make it look a little more like the red line i drew, also if you could find a way to hide the motor 2 on the wings that would improve it by a lot
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:46:39 it looks pretty good to me
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:49:55 maybe raise the seat up by a half block so you're not staring into a red wedge <@767464181938126849>
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:52:35 why do you care so much that it's like half a block overscale lol it's plane crazy true roscale for a literal go-kart would be unachievable
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:57:49 you probably think that all jets should be 1 block wide <:squam:801278498156183562>
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:27:36 i dont think so, they arent even the same scale and hexagon posted his 4 minutes later which isnt enough time to copy an entire plane

creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:20:35 if i had a dollar for every time a whitename unde got roasted to hell in creations chat and then said "FUCK YOU GUYS THIS COMMUNITY IS SO TOXIC IM LEAVING" i'd be a millionaire
(and it's true this community is toxic, but it's always the same response from all of them out of pure copium it's hilarious)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:22:37 holy hell dude it just keeps getting better <:noway:1021283202561744977>
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:24:47 okay while this is absolutely true...
It is kind of funny watching bad builds get roasted and seeing the uploader reciprocate in a comically immature way
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:27:02 well there's a difference between low effort builds and bad builds
most bad builds are most likely built by new users who arent good at the game yet, doesnt necessarily mean its low effort because they could have put hours into it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:29:37 i've never been a great builder (there's always some goofy downside to my builds because i can't ever seem to get everything just right) but i've definitely been considered at least average due to my experience in the game, and as someone who has been playing since early 2019 i just got bored of plane crazy and sick of the bugs so yeah you're 100% correct
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:33:00 i think it's mostly because of That other thing <:trollface:775024642104229898> and the reposting
but your builds aren't bad
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:35:42 me watching my 11 year old self joining plane crazy for the first time (i have wasted 4 years of my life on this broken game and have been continuing to make plane crazy videos purely out of obligation and demand for years)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 22:16:31 no way bro says he likes the skycrane but comments on the f14 💀
but yeah nose like a 🪡
creations-chat 2023-05-04 22:20:33 fair point
creations-chat 2023-05-04 22:48:06 or a pepsi harrier
creations-chat 2023-05-04 22:55:04 bro he aint a snitch anyone with a brain can very easily see that it is not plane crazy 💀
you shouldn't be breaking the rules anyway
creations-chat 2023-05-05 00:15:22 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:30:33 it got dogged on because these are the standards (this is considered a slightly above average jet - built by <@1004207882784489472>)
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:32:35 ok yeah i probably undersold it a bit maybe that wasn't the best example
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:34:41 this is old but it was good for its time and now something like this would be considered an average jet (built by <@449992260516446208>)
but anyways yeah just keep practicing, and if you post your builds expect feedback because the standards for good builds are pretty high and if your build isn't good people are probably gonna roast the hell out of it here
creations-chat 2023-05-05 14:02:14 thats what makes it average, its not perfect but its still pretty good
creations-chat 2023-05-05 14:40:34 colors are too bright, no detail, and the tower looks very boxy and plain
i dont know what ship that is so these are just my opinions on why it looks mid
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 14:41:49 hey what are the downfalls of disconnector lock again
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 14:42:05 i remember theres some reason i never use it but i forgot what it was
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 14:42:10 obviously besides it taking up space
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:02:17 💀 whitename roscalers when you tell them a plane can look good and function good without being less than 50 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:03:34 i didnt realize you were one of those people 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:03:37 build a boat is Not better
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:04:05 yes build a boat has a scale tool and no collision building which is a game changer... but the physics are ASS!!
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:04:36 and you either have to grind for hundreds of hours or spend a bunch of robux to get the scale tool and the pilot equipment set required to make builds fly
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:05:26 he's true!!
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 15:05:56 gacha life is better than plane crazy

creations-chat 2023-05-08 20:18:57 these are deadass worse than average
creations-chat 2023-05-08 20:21:10 right but the average person who plays plane crazy has like an hour of playtime and 3 builds, when most people say average build they dont mean the average person who has joined plane crazy before, they mean the average person who frequently plays the game and has several decent builds

bro's mad someone actually put the time and effort into replying with actual constructive criticism
and even if it is a little bit harsh, he clearly verbalizes what improvements need to be made to the build, therefore making it constructive

general 2023-05-11 14:37:57 i will say your anatomy and posing is really good
general 2023-05-11 14:38:17 my drawings always look like they were drawn by an 11 year old who doesnt understand anatomy
general 2023-05-11 14:39:19 i think my issue is
general 2023-05-11 14:39:22 i rarely practice
general 2023-05-11 14:39:36 also im used to drawing with chicken scratches because thats how i draw on paper
general 2023-05-11 14:39:44 so i kind of suck at digital lineart
general 2023-05-11 14:39:59 oh yeah also
general 2023-05-11 14:40:09 you know how most artists like
general 2023-05-11 14:40:16 make a sketch constructed of basic shapes first
general 2023-05-11 14:40:23 to get an idea of the proportions and posing
general 2023-05-11 14:40:29 well i dont do that because i dont really know how
general 2023-05-11 14:40:31 so i kind of just

general 2023-05-16 14:20:38 man stfu stop acting like whitenames arent allowed to talk in this server
general 2023-05-16 14:20:55 someone with a white name
general 2023-05-16 14:20:57 (no roles)
general 2023-05-16 14:21:05 basically no ranks
general 2023-05-16 14:21:07 the new people
general 2023-05-16 14:21:25 for some reason people with ranks think its funny to harass the whitenames
general 2023-05-16 14:22:05 i mean this F34RL3SS guy is definitely your stereotypical cringe unde whitename though so
general 2023-05-16 14:22:13 the trolling is justified for this one
general 2023-05-16 14:23:08 not everyone who uses discord is on it 24/7 though
general 2023-05-16 14:23:14 my cousin has discord and he checks it like once a month
general 2023-05-16 14:23:31 yeah

general 2023-05-16 14:23:57 most likely
general 2023-05-16 14:30:40 bro the creations standards in this server have dropped drastically
general 2023-05-16 14:30:49 builds that would once be considered crap are getting a lot of upvotes
general 2023-05-16 14:31:31 like you??
general 2023-05-16 14:31:57 in the small pictures it looks acceptable but when you expand them it looks like crap
general 2023-05-16 14:32:27 idk somethings just off
general 2023-05-16 14:32:31 no i mean
general 2023-05-16 14:32:34 when you click on the pictures
general 2023-05-16 14:33:03 like this looks like something someone would make in 2020
general 2023-05-16 14:33:42 LMAO
general 2023-05-16 14:33:48 no thats not good
general 2023-05-16 14:33:51 generally
general 2023-05-16 14:34:22 well you got a pretty good upvote to downvote ratio since the standards have dropped so low
general 2023-05-16 14:34:30 so a lot of people must think its good
general 2023-05-16 14:34:34 guess im in the minority
general 2023-05-16 14:34:48 oh cool
general 2023-05-16 14:34:52 ok so im not crazy
general 2023-05-16 15:01:00 ong
general 2023-05-16 15:01:28 thats actually pretty good for a tiny plane
general 2023-05-16 15:01:40 my friends told me to change it and said it was "cringey"
general 2023-05-16 15:01:44 and i kind of agreed
general 2023-05-16 15:01:54 it more accurately represented my personality though
general 2023-05-16 15:02:25 an hour what
general 2023-05-16 15:02:30 that would probably take me at least 3
general 2023-05-16 15:02:35 probably because i get sidetracked
general 2023-05-16 15:02:39 and distracted
general 2023-05-16 15:02:41 easily
general 2023-05-16 15:02:44 but still
general 2023-05-16 15:03:41 
general 2023-05-16 15:03:42 actually pretty accurate
general 2023-05-16 15:04:16 and that's probably why your builds kind of stinky
general 2023-05-16 15:04:32 your builds always seem like they're almost good but not quite
general 2023-05-16 15:04:37 like a few things are just a bit off
general 2023-05-16 15:04:41 or they lack something
general 2023-05-16 15:04:58 i don't know that's the thing
general 2023-05-16 15:05:10 like this is just flat out goofy
general 2023-05-16 15:05:38 january was only a few months ago
general 2023-05-16 15:05:49 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
general 2023-05-16 15:06:03 i have not changed since december
general 2023-05-16 15:06:07 that was when i built the king stallion
general 2023-05-16 15:06:14 which was my last serious build
general 2023-05-16 15:06:42 i still cant tell if im happy how my king stallion turned out or not
general 2023-05-16 15:06:48 it looks good but it also looks bland somehow
general 2023-05-16 15:06:56 kinda weird
general 2023-05-16 15:07:05 definitely didnt deserve to win rotorcraft competition
general 2023-05-16 15:07:29 i think everyone just pitied me because it took me like 2 weeks and i barely finished it in time for the contest
general 2023-05-16 15:07:34 they had to extend it so i could finish
general 2023-05-16 15:07:48 that was peak stress
general 2023-05-16 15:08:42 nah bro did you see that like
general 2023-05-16 15:08:46 one halo ornithopter thing
general 2023-05-16 15:08:48 that got 2nd place
general 2023-05-16 15:08:51 that was so cool and innovative
general 2023-05-16 15:08:57 that should have won
general 2023-05-16 15:09:03 wow okay
general 2023-05-16 15:09:09 🤐
general 2023-05-16 15:10:32 that was probably the last competition where there were actually good submissions
general 2023-05-16 15:11:04 theres a couple of decent ones in the ongoing clash of clans one but not quite as good as the rotorcraft contest for obvious reasons
general 2023-05-16 15:11:42 which one did you win
general 2023-05-16 15:11:46 oh
general 2023-05-16 15:11:47 right
general 2023-05-16 15:11:49 the uh
general 2023-05-16 15:11:57 i forgor what plane it was
general 2023-05-16 15:12:04 but it was in the attack aircraft competition right
general 2023-05-16 15:12:49 what was your plane even supposed to be
general 2023-05-16 15:12:55 like an a-1 skyraider or sum
general 2023-05-16 15:13:16 it definitely doesnt look like a skyraider
general 2023-05-16 15:13:27 
general 2023-05-16 15:13:35 yeah
general 2023-05-16 15:13:51 the contests always go on for way too long and have like no submissions
general 2023-05-16 15:14:14 remember when contests used to get like 30 submissions
general 2023-05-16 15:14:20 and they were actually good
general 2023-05-16 15:14:34 now contests get like 5-6 submissions
general 2023-05-16 15:14:44 which usually arent very good
general 2023-05-16 15:15:22 yeah
general 2023-05-16 15:15:35 i know i sound like a broken record saying this
general 2023-05-16 15:15:40 but if rick wants plane crazy to stay alive
general 2023-05-16 15:15:46 he has to fucking give us more updates on pc2
general 2023-05-16 15:16:01 he said he would start giving us more updates on the development and he has not done that at all
general 2023-05-16 15:16:10 only thing hes updated us on is his laziness
general 2023-05-16 15:16:14 fr
general 2023-05-16 15:18:09 f15 done got showed the beast 🥶🗣️🔥
general 2023-05-16 15:18:19 <@402617794606399488> Too many emojis.
general 2023-05-16 15:18:31 FIAHHH 🔥
general 2023-05-16 15:19:24 ok so honestly back to jef contest
general 2023-05-16 15:19:28 this ac130 is kind of goofy
general 2023-05-16 15:19:31 but i think it should have won
general 2023-05-16 15:19:36 maybe
general 2023-05-16 15:19:37 idk
general 2023-05-16 15:19:53 i mean jef's silly prop looked good but it was kind of inaccurate to the real thing
general 2023-05-16 15:20:06 and the ac130 also clearly had a lot of effort put into it
general 2023-05-16 15:20:11 even if its a bit goofy looking
general 2023-05-16 15:20:41 i just remember i kept hearing everyone say it looked goofy
general 2023-05-16 15:21:15 how do you even make an accurate plane in simple planes
general 2023-05-16 15:21:46 No
general 2023-05-16 15:21:58 i never realized how many roles sympto has
general 2023-05-16 15:22:03 thats a lot of roles
general 2023-05-16 15:22:45 nvm he doesnt have that many
general 2023-05-16 15:26:53 finally
general 2023-05-16 15:26:56 good riddance to that kid
general 2023-05-16 15:39:25 i hate how they still make you put in your credit card info
general 2023-05-16 15:39:36 its free but its not REALLY free
general 2023-05-16 15:39:40 you still have to have a way to pay for it
general 2023-05-17 15:21:08 what build
general 2023-05-17 15:21:28 thats fire though
general 2023-05-17 15:23:06 6.5/10
general 2023-05-17 15:23:16 its smooth and easy to look at but severely lacks detail
general 2023-05-17 15:23:27 and the rockets just slapped on are a bit silly
general 2023-05-17 15:23:34 overall not a bad build
general 2023-05-17 15:23:38 not a great one either though
general 2023-05-17 15:23:43 its decent
general 2023-05-17 15:23:56 it has a solid base
general 2023-05-17 15:23:59 proportions are pretty good
general 2023-05-17 15:24:08 just needs more detail and maybe a rework on the intakes
general 2023-05-17 15:25:25 warm
general 2023-05-17 15:26:25 ass fry
general 2023-05-17 16:24:53 i see a lot of improvement

general 2023-06-13 02:59:51 of the song

general 2023-06-13 03:00:20 people dont appreciate guitar anymore 🗣️‼️
general 2023-06-13 03:01:04 beat it is definitely not harder than eruption
general 2023-06-13 03:01:07 in its entirety at least
general 2023-06-13 03:01:17 theres obviously parts of eruption that are easier than beat it like the tapping part

general 2023-06-15 03:15:11 that too
general 2023-06-15 03:15:22 probably doesnt help that i was on the humbucker
general 2023-06-15 03:15:29 because the strat we have has a humbucker in the bridge

general 2023-06-15 14:03:52 the almond pickguard looks so much better
general 2023-06-15 14:03:55 makes it look vintage
general 2023-06-15 14:03:56 i love it
general 2023-06-15 14:04:09 jazzmaster my beloved..
general 2023-06-15 14:04:32 for some reason me and my dads strat's whammy bar is like really low
general 2023-06-15 14:04:44 no matter how many springs we have or how we set the bridge
general 2023-06-15 14:04:47 its always super low
general 2023-06-15 14:04:54 like it gets stuck on the knobs and the cable
general 2023-06-15 14:04:57 its awful
general 2023-06-15 14:05:28 ok now thats the dream
general 2023-06-15 14:05:42 you may disagree with me on this one but
general 2023-06-15 14:05:46 any guitar in sunburst
general 2023-06-15 14:05:50 with an offwhite pickguard
general 2023-06-15 14:05:52 is the hottest
general 2023-06-15 14:06:29 i would have gotten the classic vibe 60s telecaster which is sunburst with binding
general 2023-06-15 14:06:41 but my dad told me to get something that isnt sunburst since we already have a sunburst strat
general 2023-06-15 14:06:48 so i got the 50s in white blonde with a black pickguard
general 2023-06-15 14:06:59 and i love how it looks too but sunburst is just something else
general 2023-06-15 14:07:01 so classy looking
general 2023-06-15 15:01:04 well i know money and another brick in the wall
general 2023-06-15 15:01:10 im redoing the comfortably numb solo on my telecaster today
general 2023-06-15 15:01:16 i just dont like how my dads strat sounds
general 2023-06-15 15:01:38 theres this weird crackly breaking up thing with the fake ass modeling amp distortion

general 2023-06-25 17:26:18 roblox games only make a lot when they're popular
general 2023-06-25 17:26:22 otherwise they don't make shit

general 2023-06-25 17:26:53 500 players is a lot dude
general 2023-06-25 17:27:04 brookhaven is just unfair
general 2023-06-25 17:27:08 there's no reason for it to be popular
general 2023-06-25 17:27:10 it fucking sucks
general 2023-06-25 17:27:15 there's so many good games out there
general 2023-06-25 17:27:20 and brookhaven makes millions of dollars
general 2023-06-25 17:27:21 per month
general 2023-06-25 17:27:36 im talking about even just the game
general 2023-06-25 17:27:38 as a game its trash
general 2023-06-25 17:27:42 the models are trash

general 2023-06-25 17:28:00 its mostly comprised of free models and hurts to look at
general 2023-06-25 17:28:04 its just awful
general 2023-06-25 17:28:09 why is it so popular
general 2023-06-25 17:28:16 bloxburg i get it bloxburg is a decent game
