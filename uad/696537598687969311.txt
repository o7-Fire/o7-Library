plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:20:32 while still staying in the same position in the air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:21:55 it can
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:22:09 cant rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:22:30 if I roll it upside down
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:22:36 it will fail
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:23:34 and my thing is capable of pitch but if it will move forward
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:23:48 does it have to stay in the same place in the air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:23:59 damn
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:30:51 so even though an F-35 is considered a vtol jet it doesn't count as a vtol here?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:15 cause it has to be able to turn upside down
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:22 while maintaining the same position
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:30 you know what im talking about
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:31:52 B variant
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:32:56 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:07 idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:16 it said it needed to be capable of roll
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:46 so it doesnt have to be able to control roll while in its vtol mode?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:33:58 and only while it is just flying horizontally?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:34:14 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:34:22 idk ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:35:34 
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:35:40 I assumed it was supposed to be capable
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:35:47 of yaw pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:35:53 while in mid air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:36:02 while also maintaining the same position in the air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:36:23 meaning its not moving forward or backwards
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:37:31 idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:01 im very confused
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:18 so does an f-35 b count or not
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:33 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:42 its a jet
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:51 that is capable if vtol
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:38:55 like a harrier
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:11 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:39:32 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:40:43 the requirements arent clear if it wants all roll pitch and yaw while in vtol mode while maintaining the same position or if it wants that while flying horizontally
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:43 yea it can go up and down
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:48 but it cant flip while mid air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:41:52 and maintaining the same position
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:01 it looks like the requirements want that though
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:05 it can
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:23 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:39 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 19:42:47 alr
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 06:58:17 for the vtol engineer role is it ok if helium blocks are used to keep the nose of a plane up?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 06:58:48 damn
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:03:46 this look any good to you guys?
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:16 damn
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:19 oh well
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:28 it was supposed to be an f-35
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:33 and it is custom
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:52 yea its in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:04:57 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:05:08 I see
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:05:31 so delete it either way?
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:05:50 how can I make it better

plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:10:53 
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:11:04 thats kinda hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:16:49 did I fix it because I feel like it still sucks
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:17:21 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:21:07 I didnt know what you meant by not making it go to the sides as much
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:21:27 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:21:39 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-29 03:22:04
