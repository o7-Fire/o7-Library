creations-chat 2018-10-26 09:44:37 sick
bug-reports 2018-10-26 11:47:25 The save system is broken, I was working on my airship and when I loaded it back in the colors changed, and a top part was missing that I made ages ago
bug-reports 2018-10-26 11:48:40 I think what it did, is changing the color to the preset RGB colors that we have in the game. I used custom RGB colors through a different site.
bug-reports 2018-10-26 12:25:40 I figured that out about the boundaries, but I am more sad about the color
bug-reports 2018-10-26 12:26:06 I used custom RGB colors, to get just the right colors. and when I reload the build it switches to the closest color it can find that the game offers

plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:55:38 I can imagine
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:55:51 Try and make it so his hatch opens up too
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:55:55 So like you can store stuff inside
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:55:58 that'd be even more sick
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:56:24 I mean the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:56:29 It's where he recycles right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:57:02 That part
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 09:57:02

plane-crazy 2018-10-27 11:44:50 with a SNEK
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 11:44:54 he could move you easily
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 11:44:57 hahah xD

plane-crazy 2018-10-27 11:46:37 he beat snek
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 11:48:06 By making a 4k+ fantasy airship
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:34:31 https://i.gyazo.com/4b208202ff9332658edb6d88388895c8.mp4 SNEK | BrywireWasTaken | 730 | Inventor
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:34:44 You think that's good enough for inventor?
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:36:05 Thanks
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:36:37 Yea
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:36:39 They are
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:37:01 I wish I could make it longer tho, but that would require a bigger plot
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:37:14 You can't like, make turns in the design because of the ropes. It has to be straight
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 12:38:47 That'd be sick
creations-chat 2018-10-27 12:39:08 it's still really fun to play around with tho
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 12:39:35 Mehh
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 12:39:39 My airship is 4k+
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 12:39:43 and it flies without lag
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 12:40:01 (Probably because it gets airborne through helium)
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:17 I made rayquaza
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:18 It actually flies
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:41 That
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:43 and some other things
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:50 First i made a snek https://i.gyazo.com/4b208202ff9332658edb6d88388895c8.mp4
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:10:56 Then, I formed it into rayquaza
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 13:11:30 It already captures ppl
creations-chat 2018-10-27 13:29:27 Epicccc
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:03:31 <@!348756891457028096> I bet if you can make that fly, you'd get inventor
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:03:50 I mean, it's what I did with my snake
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:04:07 who?
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:05:19 Are you at the top of your build limit?
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:05:28 dz?
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:05:49 Then i'd suggest make it bigger
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:05:50 that way, you can get a better shape into it
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:47:52 I mean I had a snake
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:47:59 Xpert told me to make it fly to get inventor
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:48:04 So I made rayquaza
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:48:48 I honestly think some of the qualifications has to get updated in some ways
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:48:53 just to make it harder to earn them
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:49:05 You can start by making it 1 rank per creation maybe?
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:49:07 Or 2
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:49:22 Because some ppl just make giant things and get 420+ ranks
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:50:06 I mean
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:50:37 
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:50:41 I made that
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:50:44 For 2 ranks
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:50:50 just because I didn't want every in one go
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:51:14 LOL
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:51:55 There are tons of ranks yea
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:52:04 But it shouldn't feel like you're going from gym to gym for badges
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:52:13 im probably just ranting though
creations-chat 2018-10-27 18:52:14 ignore me
help 2018-10-27 20:29:56 I think it's already on
help 2018-10-27 20:30:01 idk how to load it tho
