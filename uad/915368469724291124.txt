When it snows, the snow does not melt and builds up over many years to make large, thick sheets of ice, called ice sheets.

Just like me trying to make history.
But who's to judge the right from wrong.
When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
That violence breeds violence.
But in the end it has to be this way.

I've curved my own path, you've followed your wrath;
But maybe we're both the same.
The world has turned, and so many have burned.
But nobody is to blame.
It's tearing across this barren wasted land.
I feel new life could be born beneath
The blood stained sand.

Just like me trying to make history.
But who's to judge the right from wrong.
When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
That violence breeds violence.
But in the end it has to be this way.

I've curved my own path, you've followed your wrath;
But maybe we're both the same.
The world has turned, and so many have burned.
But nobody is to blame.
It's tearing across this barren wasted land.
I feel new life could be born beneath
The blood stained sand.
