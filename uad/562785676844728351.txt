plane-crazy 2022-11-26 09:29:19 whats the best way to make a big ship move on water
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 09:33:39 spamming intensifies
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 10:02:46 decided to just spam super rockets cause my ship turned into a submarine with conveyor engines

plane-crazy 2022-11-27 00:24:42 For god's sake can the frickin motor just lock properly lock and not weirdly reset it's position after wasting 5 seconds of my time.

bug-reports 2022-11-27 04:42:37 after I move it to the right spot it just pops back
bug-reports 2022-11-27 04:42:49 really annoying
bug-reports 2022-11-27 04:43:00 sometimes it doesnt happen tho
bug-reports 2022-11-27 04:53:52 ok it seems that if I hold the locking key for a while instead of letting it go as soon as the stuff is in place then the lock will stay
bug-reports 2022-11-27 11:57:48 you gotta place them on a certain side then sorround it with something like signs
