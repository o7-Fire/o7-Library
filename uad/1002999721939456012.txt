general 2023-01-21 22:57:18 yeah
creations-chat 2023-01-22 23:47:25 i think plane crazy community needs to lower their standards, while people appreciate critics maybe people could  be a little more empathic with new users, not everything needs to be the god of motorlocks and details to look good, i know motorlocking is good for adding details and that but people need to appreciate buildings that dont have motorlock at all, its like a requirement to get upvotes, not everyone can make hyper realistic buildings and i know there are simplistic but good buildings that get upvotes, like for new people its a little sad getting 90 downvotes when posting their best (at least for them) buildings.
creations-chat 2023-01-22 23:58:57 but, i mean, i see really good builds here that get so much downvotes, not the best but they look really fine to me, and people can never think about something that isnt skill issue
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:02:00 but look, this is my bus, its not the best building of plane crazy but it looks fine, it got all the details it could get as a motorlock noob
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:04:59 i said all the detail i could as a motorlock NOOB, it even has windshield cleaners that work!
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:07:28 and it looks alright
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:11:09 so you are coming with the roscale argument?

creations-chat 2023-01-23 17:56:57 
creations-chat 2023-01-23 17:59:03 no idea how to, exposed motorlock moment
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:02:06 not gonna lie this look really good
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:02:48 its impressive how back then people really liked everything people builded
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:08 i mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:46 in old posts you see how people made planes that right now would get like 2000 downvotes but people really loved it
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:58 like even rickje was a noob back then i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:54 i think motorlock is what made people standards really high
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:06:12 when communities are tiny the toxicity is tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:06:56 like back then you could post a tutorial plane and you were in the hall of fame
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:22 i think people were not noobs back then
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:39 it was the limited resources
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:56 like
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:02 imagine if motorlock didnt exist
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:10 or it wasnt an intentional design
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:14 and rickje patchs it
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:39 skill issue is not always the answer my man
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:45 im a good motorlocker
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:50 a decent one i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:03 i can even do angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:22 but for noobs its hard
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:44 i remember my first time in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:49 i made the worst plane in history
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:54 spammed with control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:10:53 like i would love to see boxness first building
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:10:53 some examples
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:11:48 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:12:12 i need to work on the exposed motorlock tho
creations-chat 2023-01-23 18:13:17 yes yes! that one!
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:13:45 the amount of motorlock that has makes me wanna cry because skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:15:14 oh no
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:15:15 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:15:34 the problem for me is that motorlock  can be laggy as hell sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:25 also i hate the flashing textures when you fuse a block with another
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:53 that bug its hard to explain
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:39 yes but i mean like look at the 20 downvotes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:45 i feel people downvote because yes sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:18:58 you cant make an omelette without lagging the whole server
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:02 i hate it when someone cooks and omelette in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:06 and then the whole server lags
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:48 like
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:51 what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:57 that aircraft looks lovely!
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:59 to me
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:22:02 i mean, this looks really good but THIS cant be a standard
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:22:08 not saying you cant make that
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:23:01 im trying to say that this amount of detail cant be a standard for pcc
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:23:28 and thats good
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:23:54 i mean with a horn as the maneuver is enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:24:20 lazy but looks fine enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:24:46 like just paint it and there you have the handle
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:25:30 me annoyed because you cant put  a half wedge in the center of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:27:58 this can sound like skill issue but i feel like no matter how hard i try i cant make a good build that the pcc likes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:28:45 also that one upvote that i get from the toxic noob
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:29:51 the exposed motorlock looks like a metal beam, cool
general 2023-01-23 20:01:13 ahhh shii here comes pacman!
general 2023-01-23 20:02:38 you cant say a bad word on a pcc server!
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:06:04 its funny like
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:06:11 the pcc discord hates pcc reddit
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:06:22 and pcc reddit hates pcc discord
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:06:56 like in the discord they say that in the reddit they only post bad builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:07:38 but look at this
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:07:57 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:10:07 but that isnt true
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:10:12 there are good builds on the reddit
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:10:36 but people here like to throw trash at the reddit
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:21 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:26 oh noOOo
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:30 Epxed motorlcok
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:42 this is not roscale at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:45 people of pcc
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:12:47 downvote him
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:15:54 it doenst look bad at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:16:00 this is because of the standards
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:16:22 when pro people meet noobs it starts the conflict
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 20:19:35 both
