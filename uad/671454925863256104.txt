plane-crazy 2022-09-02 01:38:38 pinhead kindaaaaa
general 2022-09-02 01:39:39 is it just me or is it normal to fill empty spaces in your plane with explosives (every one of your planes)
general 2022-09-02 01:43:19 i have a question!11!1!1!
general 2022-09-02 01:43:38 how large should i build my planes (like an f-15, or an f/a-18 or something)
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 01:47:03 what is a block that has absolutely no collision
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 02:05:32 damn i need one that isnt transparent for my missiles
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 02:05:47 mhmhmhmhmhmhmmhmhmhmh why
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 02:06:06 well im screwed then
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 02:07:01 a frigate's tomahawk missiles
general 2022-09-04 14:59:45 most lag machines dont seem to work too well or are poorly made
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:07:31 a delicate balance (i came back from afk to see this)
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:09:02 its balanced i was just getting a screenshot of glass and water showing that its invisible and came back
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:09:08 i'd say its slightly more back heavy
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:10:45 recently ive just been adding small details to my old planes, i made functional afterburners and wing contrails when turning up
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:11:19 what plane is that based off of?
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:11:30 it kinda looks like a prototype boeing plane
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:12:48 cool, it kinda reminded me of that boeing prototype jet that competed with the f22
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:13:52 im thinking of the wrong plane it competed with
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:14:48 the x32 looks like a cursed f16 but i think that it was some sort of navy variant for something
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:15:58 i hate working with landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 15:17:56 i think ive seen that
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:12:23 i like planes
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:12:26 they are cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:13:07 ah yes, a respectable being.

plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:23:06 aviation is just an amazing achievement of humanity, the ability to start from ultralights, to literal jet turbine engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-04 19:23:24 is that an IFV

general 2022-10-04 22:53:26 in progress
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:35:56 (not complete at all, just started about 30 minutes ago)
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:36:21 still working on angles
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:37:39 remaking my F/A-18 because my old one is shit
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:37:59 yeah i know im not a great builder and i havnt added the intake yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:38:07 im mainly testing custom angles with this one
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:38:26 im trying to work on the wings currently
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:38:42 im trying to fix their angle
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:38:56 but the nose is just horrible
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:39:52 oh god (first person view)
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:40:21 yeah i dont use first person
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:41:07 should i make the motor lock tower taller?
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:41:17 ignore the other two cockpits
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:42:56 i like adding a lot of functionality to my planes such as afterburners and force effects, signs, and other stuff.
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:43:50 should i keep it how it is? (two 4x1 delta wings) or change it to two 3x1 delta wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:44:39 
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:44:40 f/a-18
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:45:02 yeah im trying to fix them
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:46:55 sorry im too stupid to know what trailing edge means, is it the slope behind the canopy?
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:47:07 what the hell
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:47:26 oh okay
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:47:49 ignore the one off-centered block
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:49:27 thats kinda how i previously had it
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:50:04 my old f/a-18 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:50:14 i always make my planes too small so im trying to avoid that with this one
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:53:17 yeah i had some trouble with the elevators because they were connected to the motor locked wings at the front so their height is wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:53:52 so i want to add a custom angle here but my motor lock tower is in the way, and there is no other place where i can have my tower completely concealed at
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:55:32 why does this happen with my custom angles
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:55:35 its not aligned properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:55:45 ~~like egypts government~~
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:56:13 am sad very
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:57:18 but what about the top of the aircraft behind the cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:57:57 
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:58:27 oh man i really am stupid
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:59:10 my brain is not functional  due to severe sleep deprivation and being blocked by albanian patriotic war songs
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 02:59:38 i hate everything
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:00:08 why must this plane be shaped in a... interesting way.
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:00:52 my russian logistics man is telling me you should leave it there
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:02:02 here is a project that i am considering to abandon F-15E
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:02:16 i do like the canopy though
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:02:23 a lot
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:03:02 JESUS WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:03:13 I FOUND A BUILD FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT IT
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:03:38 🤡 (It was titled F-35) it has no intake and it looks so fucking goofy
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:03:59 this is from a couple years ago it looks... very.
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:05:11 i didnt even use photos or sketchfab to build it i just started placing blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:05:55 this is an old plane i built in a couple of minutes for the only goal of exploding my friend's boat
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:06:28 you could take a guess why i "modeled" it after a japanese zero
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:06:34 i think it took me like 15 minutes for it
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:06:54 it doesnt fly well... at all..
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:07:14 i also used to make a couple of boats
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:07:43 this was a really old boat i built im not sure when i did
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:08:08 and then i have this one now im still working on
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:08:38 inspiration from this
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:08:55 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:09:57 oh and i SUCKKKKK at making ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:10:31 (the barrel is not supposed to be that long, i just made it like that when i was trying to fling my friend with it)
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:11:20 atleast it has actual stearing
plane-crazy 2022-10-08 03:12:27 heres my friend propulsion sys- i mean "rocket"

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 00:39:59 how do i fix the wings? (im only focusing on the wings rn then ill fix the rest) also yes those are custom angles at the end of the wing
help 2022-10-18 00:43:55 how do i fix the wings (i know the rest looks shitty)
help 2022-10-18 00:50:06 i did im working with the speed and length
help 2022-10-18 00:50:11 thats not a 1x4
help 2022-10-18 00:50:35 more accurate image
help 2022-10-18 00:50:40 i just held my key for too long

help 2022-10-18 00:52:22 yes
help 2022-10-18 00:52:34 the main purpose of this build it to experiment with custom angles
help 2022-10-18 00:52:39 i currently have three
help 2022-10-18 00:53:22 oh im really off
help 2022-10-18 00:55:14 oh also-- is the fuselage too long for the aircraft?

help 2022-10-18 01:26:04 oh
help 2022-10-18 01:26:09 i didnt think of that

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 23:10:50 do fabric parts have more friction or is that not coded in this game
help 2022-10-18 23:23:46 how do i connect >:C

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 23:33:35 (upd)
help 2022-10-19 00:18:32 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:19:02 thenk

plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:22:49 how can i fix the nose cone? i need it to be longer. (this is the f/a-18)
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:24:17 i dont think i have any space for more angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:40:34 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:53:44 thats cool
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 00:54:17 if i had to guess its because of speed and mass, but idk i never make tanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:31:40 i really wish i knew how this game's physics worked in depth...
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:33:41 where might i find an in depth explanation
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:34:47 in a very detailed explanations to if it contains anything such as inertia or advanced aerodynamics or advanced friction scripts
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:35:34 doubt it but the information is useful
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:36:52 friction against air particles by different surface material/texture
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:37:13 aw damn
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:37:37 any other than the wing panels and delta wings?
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:39:00 on my way to liechtenstein to plot against serbia
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:39:15 well... i am...
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:39:20 thats what im building rn

plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:39:50 and the end of the ailerons
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:41:09 how the hell can i make the engines when it currently looks like this 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:42:07 oh god

help 2022-10-19 18:12:34 why wont these connect, it just falls off
help 2022-10-19 18:13:36 no the rudders are fine but the elevators fall off
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 18:14:27 i havnt started the engine part yet so it just looks cursed rn
help 2022-10-19 18:14:47 
help 2022-10-19 18:14:50 does that help?
help 2022-10-19 18:15:20 my only issue rn is that camera not connect
help 2022-10-19 18:16:22 ah, okay, i found the issue.

plane-crazy 2023-06-25 02:06:08 make a helicopter
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 02:07:04 do a dual rotor helicopter than
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 02:07:06 theyre easier to make
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 02:08:04 do you recreate planes or make or own designs
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 03:34:08 the tracking is shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:22:55 does anyone know if plane crazy's physics system is advanced enough to have functional flaps to generate more lift
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:24:52 yes as in it can or yes as in you know it cant
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:24:56 i know its very simplified
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:38:42 ok cool
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:47:54 rickje literally just got a quick cash grab

plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:48:47 lets see
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:48:57 what percent does he make from money spent on the items
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:49:40 okay and there was limited of like 2000 hats right
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:11 okay how much was each hat when initially released
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:39 roughtly 300k was spent on it if all of them were bought
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:49 so
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:53 he roughly made
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:55 207900 R$
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:50:58 just from motor hat
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:51:27 im gonna plug that into the dev ex thing to see how much money he made
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:51:59 okay
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:52:02 so he should have made
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:52:06 727.65$ USD
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:52:11 from motor hat alone
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:52:43 that hat was literally two blocks slightly different colors
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 00:52:49 and he made 727 dollars
