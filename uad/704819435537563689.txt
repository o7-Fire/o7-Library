general 2021-10-05 16:38:13 Could I just make a 100 block cube that can hover using propeller blades and call it a helicopter
general 2021-10-05 16:38:32 Let’s say I added control to it
general 2021-10-05 16:38:36 With small propellers
general 2021-10-05 16:39:14 I have an Apache but it only uses it’s propellers for stability and small propeller engines for lift and control
general 2021-10-05 16:39:20 Do that technically isn’t a hell?
general 2021-10-05 16:39:28 Heli
general 2021-10-05 16:39:53 Oh
general 2021-10-05 16:40:22 I have a v22 that uses propellers and hover engine in its engines but it isn’t a heli. could that get vtol role?
general 2021-10-05 16:40:48 I said it isn’t heli
general 2021-10-05 16:40:57 It’s a tilt rotor aircraft 🤓
general 2021-10-05 16:41:16 Yes
general 2021-10-05 16:41:23 But not like the v22 lol
general 2021-10-05 16:42:39 Why?
general 2021-10-05 16:42:59 I tried spamming super rockets but it wasn’t near fast enough to even fly
general 2021-10-05 16:43:23 Not hover engines for hovering
general 2021-10-05 16:43:30 For thrust
general 2021-10-05 16:43:32 The glitch
general 2021-10-05 16:43:42 Ah ok
general 2021-10-05 16:43:49 Ok
general 2021-10-05 16:43:57 Lol it looks pretty good I think
general 2021-10-05 16:44:01 Just a lot of motor lock
general 2021-10-05 16:44:55 Im making a ho229 rn
general 2021-10-05 16:45:04 It looks good but it’s very messy before spawn
the-dump 2021-10-05 16:47:45 It isn’t a bomber though
the-dump 2021-10-05 16:47:52 Just because it can bomb
the-dump 2021-10-05 16:47:55 It’s cargo

general 2021-10-08 00:45:44 Why can’t we use helium in planes
general 2021-10-08 00:45:58 I have a ~1700 block plane
general 2021-10-08 00:46:12 That’s nose heavy and I can’t add anything
general 2021-10-08 00:46:15 To fix
general 2021-10-08 00:46:38 I have a version without helium that I might post and a version with like 6 helium blocks
general 2021-10-08 00:47:02 It’s extremely heavy already
general 2021-10-08 00:47:16 Hover engines doesn’t mean hover drive
general 2021-10-08 00:47:48 I was told otherwise?
general 2021-10-08 00:47:59 For a vtol aircraft
general 2021-10-08 00:48:12 I was told you can use hover drive you just can’t use them to hover
general 2021-10-08 00:48:22 Agreed
general 2021-10-08 00:48:51 I forgot
general 2021-10-08 00:49:01 But I think they were a mod
general 2021-10-08 00:51:24 How is my 1700 block plane supposed to fly without hover drive
general 2021-10-08 00:51:54 What
general 2021-10-08 00:52:11 But you can’t control throttle with that
general 2021-10-08 00:53:10 Maybe

general 2021-11-16 01:05:42 i was planning on using trapdoor
general 2021-11-16 01:05:52 but using a motor configuration would be fancier

creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:47:39 How would that be possible on a wedge
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:49:42 It would overlap and look glitched lol edit original message if respond

I guess but that’s very difficult and piston lock is hell
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:53:57 Oh yeah I didn’t think about how the piston would be exposed

You can put the piston farther back and use a   camera
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:56:52 1x0.9 block and cylinder is all I can think of

But I don’t like using 1x0.9 blocke

Yes the jet is amazing rn
creations-chat 2021-11-18 13:59:42 No circle on wings though
You can by motor locking disconnecter at wing level and put text on that
Yes
Looks like he added some sort of text block idk why there’s no circle
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:02:56 I hate this channel slow mode
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:05:27 Yes but creations itself is toxic bc some people need help and other downvote but won’t say why so they can improve
bug-reports 2021-11-18 14:14:01 Dang man just pinged rickje
creations-chat 2021-11-18 14:15:29 Yes. Though it is very hard to criticize a build without sounding mean. I told a guy his f35 back horizontal tail things were way too big (they were about at big as the wing itself) and he and his friend got mad and blocked me
bug-reports 2021-11-18 14:21:02 Rules say otherwise. Ik it says unnecessarily but it states don’t do it in general
general 2021-11-18 14:21:52 Nice nft

creations-chat 2021-11-21 01:55:42 tell him how to improve instead of calling it bad
creations-chat 2021-11-21 01:58:37 true but you can point out key things like make the wings with custom control surfaces, and fix the shape of the fuselage
