I use a tonne of motor lock and that was only last year or so
52 downvotes on it though
creations-chat 2021-03-02 17:58:55 I find that only tanks and helicopter s get upvoted these days
With the exception of small wired planes 
Big planes always are downvotes except bombers

Thanks for the help, I’ll change the colours up a bit and should I make the cockpit window glass again or keep it like right now
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:02:16 Ah yes! To get upvoted take the picture at night or sunrise

By the way how can I easily get designer V
Designer V is the most common expert rank and loads people with it only have that as a rank
help 2021-03-02 18:04:04 How can I change my nickname/display-name on this server
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:04:58 Well that’s good, I’m currently making “The Tent” from the grand tour (New Top Gear)

That dornier will get more upvotes than my I heavily motor locked to scale plane
creations-chat 2021-03-02 18:10:48 I bet that dornier will get more upvotes than my I heavily motor locked, to scale plane (the English electric lightning)

I can tell the sort of people who are in this server hate fighter planes which have detail and the sort of plane you built is to them unique so you’ll get more upvotes than down

I’m starting to understand how the human brain works...

It would be usefull to prevent builds being deleted when accidentally pressing on save instead of load

bug-reports 2021-05-28 20:48:23 Pressing on the lock prevents you from using save till you unlock it

bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:37:31 When I joined a server, all images went blurry

Normally buttons on mobile and images get blurry with time
The more lag the blurrier it gets and then it crashes

But this time it was already blurry
I know this happens on other games but it is the first time it has started at the blurriest stage.
This only happens to mobile players
creations-chat 2022-02-17 13:37:52 Good 👍
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:47:27 
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:47:48 When it gets this blurry, I just leave and rejoin because I know I will lag out
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:49:23 If I join a pvp server with the blurry buttons, they will stay in then next server so I have to exit the game and join in on the recently played page
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:53:14 The longer I am near bigger builds, the quicker it will get to the stage where angled blocks have weird dots on them
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:54:20 I have experienced since I started making builds over 500 blocks in size
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:54:46 I have spoken to other mobile players in servers and they also say that they have this problem
bug-reports 2022-02-17 13:55:40 People on pc/laptop don’t have this problem

bug-reports 2022-02-17 14:02:55 This bug was only on games!
bug-reports 2022-02-17 14:06:22 The blurry buttons has been on games since I started playing plane crazy and also on jailbreak
Just today it is now everywhere
bug-reports 2022-02-17 14:07:13 Roblox has never done shit for mobile
bug-reports 2022-02-17 15:01:50 If you could play on mobile and have graphics on the highest, throw your plane in lava and try cause lag
You would get the blurry buttons
bug-reports 2022-02-17 15:02:37 It is an issue on roblox, you wouldn’t be able to fix it.
bug-reports 2022-02-17 15:03:01 I thought it was only plane crazy till the site went blurry
bug-reports 2022-02-17 15:03:23 There is a possibility it is something which can be fixed

Turn cameras
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:30:12 And also I can’t open trapdoors

Some mobile players can but there is a large green button covering 10% of the screen
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:30:54 What would be a good idea is if mobile players just tapped on it with no special button
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:31:46 Like on computer, you would click on the trapdoor and it opens, no green marker on top
bug-reports 2022-02-17 19:40:06 Maybe you could add an option in setting to add block contours so that building is made easier

creations-chat 2022-04-02 14:59:29 <@!882767865604882453> wings are fat and you could add shades with paint
The paint on it’s own isn’t great either, you could motorlock wing panels in the wing to make camo at an angle
creations-chat 2022-04-02 15:07:18 If you don’t want cheese grater wings, motorlock wing pannels over them or only add control surfaces at the back of the wing where a real plane would have them

I see why it would be difficult to make the wings les thick, you have landing gear
Then perhaps angle lock the wing from the landing gear to the edge making it like the avro vulcan if you want to keep the landing gear

||farschulpanzer 1 with panzer 3 turret and wood gasifier||
creations-chat 2022-04-06 19:13:51 I see the effort to make it detailed but there are many issues
The turret is quite elevated 
The tracks don’t look great, you could try put cylinders and angle signs
Put a sign at the end of the gun barrel to show the hole in the gun
The exhaust rust doesn’t really improve detail
You could try desert camo like in the image shown, it is lighter with two beige shades and would make it easier to see detail
You could also add the tank number on the side as detail
And the last thing is that you could move all the buttons into a corner of the screen which you crop off the image
