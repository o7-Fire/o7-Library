creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:11:12 Ok someone give me proper feedback on how I can improve my F-18
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:37:11 <@!780574146919792700> no I didn't I can un lock to show you and <@!438492646311329794> that was a lot of info I was making this for a carrier but it came out to big just a little and some angles you can't get due to plane crazy is plane crazy its a video game not a building simulator. Exposed motor lock I understand is anoyying I couldn't get it to go away. Folding the wing upward would of added a motor and no I am not flying in the back seat thats the wizo's job it just looks like that because my internal view has somethings that make it look weird.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:40:06 <@!389516889501728779> thank you for that. <@!438492646311329794> I have canopy framing just its hard to see because of the canopy. I colored it dark. and what I mean by impossible is how my motor locking worked out I couldn't do to much. You don't need all the details to make a plane look good.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:42:08 <@!780574146919792700> why would I post a build that I copied in PCC? thats just not a smart idea.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:44:09 <@!438492646311329794> ok those are somethings I can fix thank you for that I will either rebuild or fix em if I find a way through my motor lock.
creations-chat 2021-03-03 02:36:00 I was about to say the black makes the nose pop but then I relize the WHOLE NOSE IS A DIFFERENT COLOR

creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:04:45 <@!610450108718252086> I just want to clarify is it a F-15 and if it is your canopy is nothing like it and you need more of a spine down the middle. Your wings are pretty good besides those back wings need to have more of a double spike on the start and make it kinda like this. Your wings should look like the picture and use motor lock to add your ailerons
creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:07:24 <@!610450108718252086> Need to show respect for the lad that is wearing that awesome hat.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:29:25 Any Feedback
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:32:05 I might but it's gonna become a bit wider and on each side will be detail. But it's kinda funny how it's my first real battleship I tried on
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:34:24 It just shows how a little effort can make something be decent.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:45:56 <@!310238229666201602> Love the 40k Chainsword. Don't see a lot of 40k in PCC.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:49:35 How could I fix the hull? Is it to wide? And I use a custom wedge to make it look like that I don't need more then 1 angle on each side so eh.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:53:03 It needs to be longer is the problem. It's my first custom battleship and a new tatic to my build. I will see how this turns out and if not then I can just restart.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:55:10 See thats the problem I like the single angle and not multiple little different angles. But what it really needs is a longer and less wide type of hull. Which I will try in my next shot
creations-chat 2021-03-17 17:28:29 Any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-03-17 17:43:23 Lmao I just built the plane to see what people would think XD.

bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:34 and loading a build
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:38 both didn't work
bug-reports 2021-04-09 03:26:59 What I did was just leave and rejoined and it worked lol
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:27:39 yea never mix a F-4 with a F-14 that looks like cancer
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:29:42 thats the product of a F-14 and a F-4 that had a kid that was autistic. It also has these weird F-18 lookin wings like why. I mean I see where you are trying to get but personally it looks like some rushed navy plane. Like a product of a poor country that needed a carrier ops fighter
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:33:21 I think what would help is spreading the wings in the back. then make a buble canopy and try that and see if that makes anything better
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:37:32 and make the front of the canopy a shorter slope since it's a smaller build.  The nose looks like its with the canopy so it makes it feel like its thrown inward and doesn't have a distinct canopy. So instead of the wedge you have half the length of the wedge so you can get something like this.
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:40:53 np
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:43:00 is this based off of anything? And if not make the cannon barrel longer. It looks like a stub rn

creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:49:46 I honestly due to the lock didn't have a good space to add the gun without it looking bad. so I put it on the side cause why not.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:59:20 ok I might. that was my first true pvp tank I've built so I think it's got some decent armor for what it is

creations-chat 2021-08-02 06:39:15 sadly I can't add rockets. my pc wont render the rockets or my game is just broken cause I try and fire them while flying and they disappear
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:34:00 Custom CAS turbo prop so far (WIP) any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:38:03 That look any better?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:41:12 I'm still deciding but I think im gonna put 2 propellers on the wings and kinda get a p-38 ish look
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:55:51 should I do a rear prop?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 18:23:40 Ok not a turbo prop but it's gonna look cool once finished

creations-chat 2021-08-04 20:18:41 Custom turboprop ATG any feedback
creations-chat 2021-08-05 20:35:49 he has 2 exposed motors and thats only on the wings. so what
creations-chat 2021-08-06 00:35:40 <@!514201352142979074>  https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/872989838415114321 I feel like your main wings and your vertical stabilizers need to be moved back a few blocks. your vertical stabilizers are also a bit to thick. You should make them like a block thinner. Other then that it's pretty good

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 04:32:44 So if you have a plane that goes 600 speed that would be like 600 kph which equals 372 mph, now mach is 767 mph so that means you need to go around 1234 kph to hit mach. Which is about 1250 sps?

general 2022-04-02 01:06:37 The tomcat is a Interceptor aircraft based off of carriers
general 2022-04-02 01:06:47 it was also know as the MiG killer
general 2022-04-02 01:06:50 The Hornet
general 2022-04-02 01:06:56 is a multi role fighter aircraft
general 2022-04-02 01:06:59 that can do everything
general 2022-04-02 01:07:03 from CAS
general 2022-04-02 01:07:04 to
general 2022-04-02 01:07:09 Intercepting bombers
general 2022-04-02 01:07:11 and dogfights
general 2022-04-02 01:07:19 F-14 was more of a Interceptor I thought
general 2022-04-02 01:07:25 its CAS was shiz
general 2022-04-02 01:07:35 Yea
general 2022-04-02 01:07:47 F-14 is a fighter that was used as a interceptor aircraft
general 2022-04-02 01:08:04 MiG-28 from topgun was a F-5
general 2022-04-02 01:08:08 idk why they didn't use real migs
general 2022-04-02 01:08:30 Ah
general 2022-04-02 01:08:31 Ok
general 2022-04-02 01:08:41 Goblin haha
general 2022-04-02 01:09:07 Goblin was a aircraft that was based off of a flying carrier type project I believe
general 2022-04-02 01:09:21 They were trying to take a B-52 or something and make it a carrier
general 2022-04-02 01:09:24 for small craft
general 2022-04-02 01:09:29 L
general 2022-04-02 01:09:32 ah
general 2022-04-02 01:09:39 that was the other plane I was thinking off
general 2022-04-02 01:10:01 Haha forgot about that
general 2022-04-02 01:10:08 Yea
general 2022-04-02 01:10:11 Maybe
general 2022-04-02 01:10:15 I don't remember
general 2022-04-02 01:10:19 Yea
general 2022-04-02 01:10:35 Didn't they try some of the first like round the world missile launchs off the B-52
general 2022-04-02 01:10:47 Some experemental shiz
general 2022-04-02 01:11:32 I like the paint on it ngl but their numbers with the F-14 are ass
general 2022-04-02 01:11:43 they have really bad kill ratios with it
general 2022-04-02 01:12:13 I think
general 2022-04-02 01:12:16 I don't remember to much
general 2022-04-02 01:12:29 Probably
general 2022-04-02 01:12:36 they still had like 35/45 kill ratios XD
general 2022-04-02 01:12:39 3/4 kill ratio
general 2022-04-02 01:13:18 It was probably cause all the engine failures the F-14A and F-14B's had
general 2022-04-02 01:13:33 so unreliable
general 2022-04-02 01:14:02 Make a Su-34
general 2022-04-02 01:14:23 Su-34 would be odd but fun
general 2022-04-02 01:14:34 hmm
general 2022-04-02 01:14:35 make a
general 2022-04-02 01:14:41 F-16C Block 50
general 2022-04-02 01:14:46 Isreali paint
general 2022-04-02 01:15:13 I want to make a F-14A for pvp but can't get the right angles

creations-chat 2022-04-18 17:55:55 he
creations-chat 2022-07-31 03:47:32 @here doesnt anyone know how to convert SPS to MPH????
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:48:21 <@927438201503772682> here?
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:48:34 Sps to MPH I have summer brain my head doesn't want to work
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:05 So if im going
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:08 900 sps
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:11 that equals
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:32 its 5 cm
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:36 ik that
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:49:48 My conversions just werent working
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:50:07 im trying to figure out how many G's im pulling if im going 900 sps in a 11 second turn circle
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:50:18 proving how broken PC is
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:51:56 u sure thats correct???? 1 stud is 5 cm????? 1/20th meter? that doesnt add up cause 900 sps = 3006
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:52:26 explain your math?
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:52:47 so if im going 900 sps im going 3000 mph and pulling a 11 second turn circle
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:52:50 JESUS CHRIST
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:53:02 my poor pilot's back is obliterated
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:53:09 Real
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:53:36 https://tenor.com/view/giga-chad-gigachad-big-gif-21053844
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:53:37 my pilot rn:
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:53:52 ik 1 stud is 5 cm
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:54:11 I did maths and 1 stud=5cm so 900 stud=4500cm
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:54:49 wait so 20 studs is 1 meter per sec
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:55:39 now my conversions are saying im only going 100 mph which make no sense
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:56:33 0.62620743779080167979mph is 1 sps on dev forum
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:56:46 563.586694012 thats my speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:57:15 so around 564mph im just gonna say 1 sps = 0.6 mph
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:57:25 so 900x0.6
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:57:36 540 mph
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 03:59:48 jesus christ I am the embodiment of that emojiðŸ¤“
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:04:07 I can't calcuate G force jesus
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 04:06:06 well ik im pulling more then 40g's
