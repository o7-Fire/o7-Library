The Tale of partiallyfrozen (622209830794428460)
bug-reports 2020-05-15 07:02:46 The new pontoons are messing up my torpedoes and im not sure how to fix it
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:51:37 The full block pontoons have messed up most of my boat builds, could we revert or get the old mechanics??
bug-reports 2020-05-18 06:02:28 torpedoes are freezing when fired off the deck of my ship, they bug fowards slightly when they are touched though
bug-reports 2020-05-20 05:47:19 the outlines are gone and i hate it
bug-reports 2020-05-20 06:04:18 oh...
bug-reports 2020-05-20 06:04:31 i still hate it though
bug-reports 2020-05-20 06:04:56 it makes everything feel like plastic and it kinda loses texture in builds

plane-crazy 2023-07-06 03:49:41 Does anyone know why large ships get incredibly slow? Any ways i can improve it or common mistakes that slow them down?
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 03:50:13 Anything that can be done?
plane-crazy 2023-07-06 03:51:39 Well thats a shame, but thanks for settling my problem of trying to figure out why the boat just keeps getting slower lol
