help 2023-05-13 15:05:37 personal preference really, but I like to have to rotation wings (red) on the outside and the up/down on the inside (blue)
help 2023-05-13 15:05:47 split wing thing
help 2023-05-13 15:05:59 oh wait its motor wings
help 2023-05-13 15:06:21 tail ones rotation front up/down
help 2023-05-13 15:07:12 hmm
help 2023-05-13 15:07:46 might be weight issues. if theres alot at the front then your "roll" will turn into a turning nose dive
the-dump 2023-05-13 15:23:22 dont worry, I have been promoting this for the past 20 years
the-dump 2023-05-13 15:23:44 police keep showing up but its probably the neighbours doing somethin

help 2023-05-13 17:29:47 ballast spread evenly?
help 2023-05-13 18:27:49 I know this sounds stupid but try building a giant pad above it that is completely flat and connected to the main submarine, you can disconnect it underneath, i think that you have a tall part that the water just kinda wants to keep up
help 2023-05-13 18:27:56 I find that happens with my planes sometimes
help 2023-05-13 18:28:01 tip of my rudder never goes under

plane-crazy 2023-05-20 22:42:04 IT has to be a plane for Aeronautic engineer right
plane-crazy 2023-05-20 22:52:56 I have this old thing that flies but it does not look like a plane but its about 3k blocks
bug-reports 2023-05-22 01:23:31 I have found this bug where a single block, covered with hover thrusters on every side with ignore others on, will float completely stable without dropping.

The strange thing is that this will still apply after the hover engines are turned completely off, it will still float with no movement whatsoever
help 2023-05-22 13:42:52 how come if I have a conveyor engine and more than one landing gear it freaks out and breaks
