plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:01:57 What does the locked motor add to the bomb
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:02:20 That‚Äôs not how they work
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:06:45 They don‚Äôt work like reality when a tnt explodes it destroys the blocks around it in the set radius any more tnt does not increase the effect besides force based on the explosion
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:07:32 ‚Äúwind would be eazy to add‚Äù yeah sure.....
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:09:58 Yo anyone got good torpedos?

general 2020-10-23 17:05:30 Who needs all those different shells when you can just flak them
general 2020-10-23 17:09:25 You say flak is bad but you gotta realize that it‚Äôs a shell full of explosive the size of your body
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 17:12:38 How many of you here agree with tnt armor being used in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 17:13:04 Forward

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 18:07:30 Wait if you say ‚Äúping (incert name here)‚Äù does the bot warn you?

creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:29:15 It‚Äôs the smallest sub you can make
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:37:05 One time I managed to get a glitch that gave me 2 motor slots unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get to finish placing all of the first motors before and untimely discontect
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:48:15 I did a size comparison my extensors bridge is shorter that his üò¶
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:52:26 Is this enough motor?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:54:43 Only if the glitch blesses me with 2 motor 1 slots   Oh wait
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:59:51 Like that silly

creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:15:36 No one likes my plane.....
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:40:38 I would say the desert ones
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:03:30 I am super confused on how or why people upvote stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:07:42 I can understand calling it low effort because it‚Äôs simplistic but I think people see rigidness as effort
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:14:51 Bruh use wells on your turrets
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:26:02 Down here salt is a way of life
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:58:15 An extensors bridge can‚Äôt appease the mass I don‚Äôt know what will
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:32:41 Down here salt is a way of life
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:51:55 I can‚Äôt figure out how to get stability without helium help plz
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:52:57 Aw yes I‚Äôll use flaps in order to escape the spin
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:55:38 Wait a minute if I don‚Äôt want to use helium I need to move the fins so upon going back down they invert their stability yay.....
creations-chat 2020-10-24 03:59:56 If my rockets jumps off on start above 800 but goes bellow during flight does it count as 800 reached off engine power?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:00:46 I don‚Äôt under stand how is gets a stupid speed boost when is starts to take off the first second is 2000 and after that it drops to 900
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:31:36 Once you pass 700 there is no space for anything but super thrusters
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 05:35:23 Anyone here gotten the mad scientist or crazy scientist ranks?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:52:08 Majestic
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:54:27 Fun fact in this game ever block is effected by drag no matter what you do, if you want to increase the speed of your creation try limiting how much surface area is pointing forward by using small pieces and/or beams
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 06:01:37 Yeah your forgetting a wing
general 2020-10-24 08:24:36 It‚Äôs 12:24 why are you all here

creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:15:20 IKR its not in ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:16:22 Crinjge you have no ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:19:58 I‚Äôm on a quest for ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:22:39 That‚Äôs not chunky still
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:26:36 People just stop with being salty with self upvotes it‚Äôs not gonna summon satan
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:28:42 It‚Äôs just unnecessarily toxic
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:37:27 I honestly just have to post all of my stuff so I can grab the ranks WAIT my torpedo might give me a chance at inventor
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:39:33 Here‚Äôs the thing, my torpedo goes an a straight line at high speeds and is dropped into the water. it‚Äôs a true torpedo
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:42:30 If I post it though I‚Äôm gonna need a big daddy torpedo because it‚Äôs maximum drop height for boats is awful
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:48:58 Make the like boats Ôøº buoys with seats
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:21:52 Why not piston lock
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:25:44 Yo how about the power of camera orientation?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:30:07 Somethings wrong about that block
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:33:40 @0BC oh boy aw man it‚Äôs not blue
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:35:26 I needed to take a better approach: make an account with an identical name but with one difference, then ping it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:36:28 It must be the rank thing
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:50:45 How many blocks are required to create a working sub? Making sure it moves in the intended direction, can turn
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:54:15 Wood in a sheet like fashion
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:56:26 You might be too front heavy
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:22:45 Need help improving
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:23:46 That‚Äôs darker than I thought. My mouse is still there
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:26:03 Not sure how that improves it but ok

general 2020-10-25 03:28:54 I ask you if he have a comment on thy plane in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:30:48 I thought green was the uncreative color
general 2020-10-25 03:33:43 Ok this is unsuccessful...

bot-central 2020-10-25 03:39:46 I see how it is...
bot-central 2020-10-25 03:40:22 Yeah I see that
bot-central 2020-10-25 03:41:02 I was hoping to see what it was going to give me
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:42:29 You almost did the same picture
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:43:55 I need to get better at using motor locks for decoration
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:46:47 Actually I don‚Äôt think I can use motor lock for any detail as the wings having to fold take up too much space
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:49:50 I discovered motor locking while building it but because of its size and placement of wheels and wings made it hard to add stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-25 04:18:29 I dare someone to only use staircases as scaffolding on a large build
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:32:17 I think there might be a bug with speed over 700. And if there isn‚Äôt, then there is on takeoff when it starts at 2k
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:51:50 But seriously how am I supposed to attempt to beat the challenges if 200 super rockets don‚Äôt make the speed pass 700 during flight
bug-reports 2020-10-25 06:20:32 You‚Äôre not helpful
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:41:36 I‚Äôm one step away from doing the thing but I have no idea how I‚Äôm gonna make a mini vtol on top of a rocket.

creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:40:38 Moonshine, chloroplasts require sunlight to produce energy and the sun is required for the moon to shine, also alcohol is sugar
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:47:29 How I show video gosh darn it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:52:24 All I have to say is put a 5v5 motor on your creation and spin to win
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 20:48:50 Obc has arrived
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:50:20 I ask you to add wells gosh darn it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:51:28 All turrets should have wells
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:55:58 Did you know that there was suiside bombers before the kamikaze?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:06:37 A narwhal photobombed me
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:12:05 Did I hear torpedos?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:13:07 People think they can attach an engine to the back of tnt and call it a day
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:15:30 If it helps I do have experience with torpedos and have a mini droppable torpedo for boats
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:16:50 No no no sir I can make them for planes it just requires some tweaking I plan on making one for high drop heights soon
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:20:04 If you search what I have posted you should find the micro torpedos that I had on my boat
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:28:26 It‚Äôs pain trying to make larger torpedos
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:49:03 Reloading is eazy, it‚Äôs accurate torpedos that‚Äôs the problem
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:51:39 For it to qualify as a torpedo it must be able to travel in a straight line including up and down
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:54:34 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:57:35 If your a boat I got a torpedo for you

creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:21:15 Shotguns that snipe missiles targeting the tank
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:23:29 Ah missiles imagine being in a plane and a heat seeking missile approaches you from behind and slices your plane in half with a tungsten rubber band
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:05:57 When you finish painting and the block count drops
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:12:41 Welp I can‚Äôt find the missing part guess I‚Äôll paint again
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:14:31 Oh boy I crashed so I can‚Äôt undo the save
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:25:44 Should I begin my rocket challenge?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:12:29 Today I figured out that spring exists and that it is a better disconnecter.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:14:15 Spring has break weld and auto retract. You can use it for reloading as well. The break weld means I don‚Äôt have to use tnt is I don‚Äôt want the thing I‚Äôm discarding to leave a trace
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:19:05 I mean you did cause this to yourself
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:49:41 What is the larger plane yes have ever seen?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:55:59 A Uboat is a boat that dives
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:57:48 No no no you don‚Äôt get it a U-boat is literally just a boat with ballast tanks
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:59:43 A submarine is designed to be underwater U-boats are not. They effectively hold their breath and aren‚Äôt meant to stay underwater.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:01:46 ‚ÄúWhat if we did a controlled sink‚Äù
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:03:12 It‚Äôs just like how kamikaze is a type of suiside bombing. It was the one with kites on peoples feet.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:04:27 Not gay they were smart bombs
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:07:46 Kamikaze is a type of suicide bombing where they tied a kite to their feet and gave them a bomb.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:09:33 The glider suiside bomber are way more effective
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:11:23 I‚Äôm on team not a submarine
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:12:33 It‚Äôs like that plane they threw off a cliff and said it flied
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:13:35 <@!410455661814480896> those are called actuator tanks and they exist and were used often
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:15:01 It‚Äôs important to note the Uboat Ôøº relied on batteries to stay underwater
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:17:29 The Uboat is basically a plane that can‚Äôt use its engine in the air
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:18:49 That information is for normies
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:21:17 Once the Uboat drained its batteries it would have to surface
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:22:19 They say they are a sub because they are the precursors to subs

creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:12:57 I love how adding a few signs as detail makes people upvote something they could call low effort
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:13:59 If you would stop the particles from appearing in the crevasses I think it would look better
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:23:12 When you configure cameras you can point them at blocks doing this will also make them twist what they where welded to and they can break apart welds
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:46:43 Why do people upvote jets so much
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:48:33 Make wing triangle get 50 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:50:34 Does anyone have a good engine for large planes?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:51:36 It just has to have a cruising speed of at least 200

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:02:25 From my experience crossouts growth does not flatten out early  like most game and you progress at the same rate to where I am
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:03:27 I play both games the progression in war thunder and the things you mentioned are really bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:05:02 And in crossout you and make money when changing anything about your vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:08:30 The way you progress in crossout is through the market. I can sell a part for more than I bought it for.
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:10:11 Eh your gonna use the market way before you can manage to even get in a clan
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 21:12:00 You need gold to craft and the way your gonna get gold is through the market. And it‚Äôs a good idea to make sure your actually making a profit by crafting.

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 20:56:09 Water is laggy
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:33:40 The rails in the game are designed so badly their width is understandable because of block size but doesn‚Äôt do you any favors and the turns and elevation change are a pain to deal with
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:34:22 The only good things about them are the indentations they have
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:35:46 I do want to know how many people would be willing to accept a track width change
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:37:34 The current tracks have indents
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:37:55 I use it to effectively make hover trains
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:39:27 I was thinking of shrinking the gauge by 2 blocks and halving the width of the rails
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:41:56 Two gauges would be redundant
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 21:42:50 Must trains will only be made for 1 gauge and also double the tracks

the-dump 2020-11-15 22:36:51 Annoyed of having to rearm the mousetraps every time they get set off? Well your in luck! Introducing The Revolver Mousetrap! All you gotta do is open the chamber, place a bullet in and close it up and it‚Äôs ready for action! The Revolver Mousetrap has 6 uses before it has to be reloaded! Thats 6 mice dealt with before you had to do anything! 
‚ÄúNow what if the quick little mice get the cheese before it can go off?‚Äù
Unlike regular mousetraps, The Revolver Mousetrap has the speed of a bullet, nothing is escaping it when it goes off?
‚ÄúMy little Timmy keeps activating the mouse traps in our house, how will The Revolver Mousetrap solve my problem?‚Äù
Not a problem at all! The Revolver Mousetrap will give little Timmy a little sting on his hand for being such a bad boy and you‚Äôll still have 5 more uses on mice!
‚ÄúThanks The Revolver Mousetrap! I don‚Äôt have to worry about those pesky little mice or Timmy again!‚Äù

plane-crazy 2020-11-18 06:52:05 Does anyone got any good heli stabilization tips?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:08:52 But seriously I need some help on stabilizing my gun. Does anyone got any heli stabilization tips?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:14:46 Ok but the physics it uses only apply to this game due to how we make helicopters fly
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:16:35 Its mainly to fix my pitch as I don‚Äôt wanna wing spam it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:20:37 Yes but helicopters have a little thing called a swash plate that facilitates their job and because they have constant rotational speed it less lessens the efficiency causing a lot of problems for no gain. Like how long it can hover
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:22:50 In this game helicopters work by effectively having a massive parachute on top that makes them stable by slowly descending
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:24:44 Try and make a heli stable while slowly ascending. You‚Äôll realize the physics problem with the amount of drag of your blades
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:27:10 While slowly descending your rotor will try to be above the center of mass, if you go upwards it will try and be below it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:29:15 The rotors don‚Äôt have a sense in direction as long as your moving up there is more drag on them than your body so they will try to move below you center of mass
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:30:47 Put fins on the top of a rocket to facilitate this principle. On a regular heli the blades will try on go up with the help of a gyro. You do not have a gyro
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:34:20 I‚Äôm talking about this game not real life helis that don‚Äôt use the same principles to fly in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:36:47 first off their is not lift in this game and lift is not inherently upward. THE METHOD IS A SWASH PLATE the have acces to changing the coefficient of lift of their blades
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:39:26 Without a swash plate you can not move, you can not stabilize yourself, you can not fly
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:41:16 How do you think helicopters move
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:43:03 Your ‚Äúlift‚Äù is only facing up while your facing up it does not stabilize you
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:45:53 ‚ÄúHelicopter technician‚Äù and I we were talking abut the difference between roblox and real life based on how we get a heli to fly in roblox well

general 2020-11-21 01:50:26 I heard that Jesus can walk on water can he walk on liquid thorium
general 2020-11-21 01:51:46 Imagine using uranium in a reactor
general 2020-11-21 01:52:43 Uranium is supper bad it‚Äôs sucks for power and it likes to turn into steam on you
general 2020-11-21 01:53:36 I love how movies represent nuclear reactors
general 2020-11-21 01:53:59 They think a melt down involves a large explosion
general 2020-11-21 01:54:44 And that reactors still use uranium or are prone to meltdowns in the first place if damaged or unattended
general 2020-11-21 01:54:50 Yeah
general 2020-11-21 01:55:01 The uranium steam was the problem
general 2020-11-21 01:56:36 But all reactors now use thorium because it gives way more power easier and cheaper to mine
general 2020-11-21 01:57:00 And it needs a small bit of plutonium to work in a reaction
general 2020-11-21 01:57:33 So there‚Äôs a well below it that will melt before it can have a failure

plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:24:36 Do people not understand how explosions work it the first place?
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:28:29 people think stacking explosives in games like roblox makes them more powerful.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:31:20 Roblox uses the most comon and simple design, there‚Äôs a radius 
anything in that radius is hit by the explosion
anything hit by the explosion has its specified event happen
in this game it‚Äôs destroy block and give momentum
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:32:29 Also when an explosion goes off it triggers explosion event
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:33:43 Spawning a particle that is what you see as well as breaking any joints in its separate radius
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:34:10 That‚Äôs not the point
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:35:16 unless there is more tnt along the face and it isn‚Äôt destroyed by subsequent explosions, it won‚Äôt deal any extra damage
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 08:35:59 Soon

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:37:38 Like he was a weeb himself
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:48:27 the best way to balance the game against shredders would be to add localized fuel and then make fuel mandatory in pvp forcing the shredders to carry fuel on them making them way easier to take down
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:50:08 Well currently for missiles you only need a thruster and a tnt block adding fuel to them isn‚Äôt really a next to them as we add blocks o them anyway
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:51:26 Most shredders are poorly designed and suck at cutting through layers of blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:52:55 But of course you can still make a super fast shredder that can deeply cut through creations and doesn‚Äôt need blacklist to function
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:53:09 And make them small
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:54:14 I good shreader uses a nose and has I few lined around the head to counter sliding across the target
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:55:40 Sabers are effective for damaging the enemy but they can still skid on your target not dealing much damage when this happens
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:56:46 also if in a swarm using the weapons like lava in some of them would greatly increase the damage dealt by said shredders
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:09:53 the role of the plane is plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:12:07 I challenge someone to build a plane that only qualifies for rank 1 of aeronautical engineer and make it get positive upvotes

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:17:44 It uses parachutes as a moment dampener
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:17:57 but it‚Äôs super had to deploy
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:18:02 Hard
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:23:18 I have found better ways since it was made
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:27:12 It‚Äôs a big boi platform that floats

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:40:07 I‚Äôm counting the heli as a stage but it‚Äôs weird as I don‚Äôt know if the pod should land in the water or the heli should go to the water

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:45:37 It will look like a rocket and a heli
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:46:44 Inside a rocket is a folded heli that when it lands will be a full functioning heli
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 01:48:39 Currently the only thing weird will be the front of the heli and how the blades aren‚Äôt directly connected to the heli

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:50:59 ha I didn‚Äôt build that
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 03:53:00 It‚Äôs the idea of showing stuff off with the idea of being praised for owning such a thing rather than the skill used to get it

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:34:34 Obc ranting
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:35:28 So what your saying is we need to purge of all who downvote by ourselves?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:36:12 Get out your pitchforks people I‚Äôll send you their location and you‚Äôll hunt them down
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:37:53 Many blocks shouldn‚Äôt be used for the purpose that they are used for its misinformation spread through plane crazy servers
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:38:21 Like control panel spamming on large planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:39:45 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:40:59 Roblox is not a good information channeled game how stuff works and why it works is a thing you have to trust in a random person with a 25% chance of being right
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:43:20 On toxicity it‚Äôs sort of a lineage passed on
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:44:36 Like self upvoting literally does not benefit them in any way yet people crucify people who do it. It‚Äôs simply a way continuing it to avoid it
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:44:47 Also ego
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:46:33 Like what do people upvote or downvote on in creations what is their reasoning beyond the toxic people
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:48:21 Weather or not they have a better version/ seen a better version?
If they think it took a certain amount of time?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:48:32 It just looks nice?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:48:58 Or do people vote on how creative it is?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:49:53 well compared to what
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:50:37 People avoid things that aren‚Äôt conventional when voting
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:52:02 When you present your creation how do they trust what you say about it?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:55:03 well what if a feature of yours they don‚Äôt believe so they downvote for you lying
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:55:46 Like something like custom slopes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:59:25 You just have to realize that this community isn‚Äôt well structured and many people come here with ideas they developed while playing the game before coming here and when they got here mimicking the toxicity they see as what‚Äôs we see as toxic is most of the guidelines you can see
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:00:48 It‚Äôs hard to find what‚Äôs a healthy idea of comers in Pcc but it‚Äôs easy to find a toxic one
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:02:39 The mods would effectively have to put out a way to vote in order to fix how voting is
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:04:53 Tutorial build posters think in a manner of this
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:05:10 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:07:24 The only way to try and prevent toxic behavior beyond banning anyone who does it is by trying to shape peoples opinions
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:09:45 That‚Äôs the point of what I say
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:19:54 That‚Äôs called ego
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:20:44 If they ask you why you down voted just mentally destroy them

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:52:12 Then would itself move toward the target or would it launch something

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:00:47 a plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:01:57 No no I got better
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:03:47 an F-15
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:04:45 Rotors don‚Äôt make heli fly
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:05:08 they give lift
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:05:29 you need pitch yaw and roll
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:05:36 All in place
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:06:22 you run into a runway affect that happens while in motion
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:06:32 You tilt forward
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:06:38 You slide forward
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:06:48 The rotors catch
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:07:07 The fuselage swings
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:07:12 More tilt
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:08:30 In order to change your outcome you need to have the ability to resist turning
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:09:11 Having a higher mass to blade coverage does help
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:09:40 So that momentum can overpower the drag off the blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:10:17 Also slowly falling will stop another affect you don‚Äôt want
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:11:02 Yes and no
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:11:13 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:12:19 It is super easy to stop rotors from Turing you with coaxial and thruster blades only being a minor inconvenience
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:12:50 Did you max them out
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:13:14 Yeah what is on the back of your creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:13:29 10 ballast block is super heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:14:00 Less
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:14:12 And if it‚Äôs ice way less
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:14:44 0.28 is water buoyant I think
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:15:05 Well it may be reg block with 1 being water
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:15:15 That would make more sense
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:16:13 I only need a single ballast block to balance my helivolver and it is super back weighted
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:16:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:01:50 Roblox got rid of glass having a glow effect underwater
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:02:10 I used it as an antenna for subs and now I can‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:03:18 Glass is still super useful underwater as it can be used as a sonar
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:12:37 Only when over it and it has a layering error with the water layer
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:13:21 Only at high graphics when the surface swaps to being transparent
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:13:45 It has to do with graphics settings
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:14:17 The sonar thing while underwater has to do with rays so it‚Äôs at that point
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:15:44 the sonar is like a squish so in a sub I can see things like boats far away underwater and while they are on top of me even if there is no line of sight between my character and the boat due to refraction
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:16:37 Roblox has an interesting lighting engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:17:04 It sucks on shadows  but it‚Äôs glass and beams are good?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:18:23 Low line count I guess with a bad shadow compensation
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:18:57 It‚Äôs just how they calculate indents for shadows
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:19:57 It‚Äôs not designed for the purpose of geometric patterns
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:21:34 It‚Äôs like .jpeg vs .png .jpeg was made for organic shapes and suffers when rigid lines are used
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:23:24 It‚Äôs from its lossy compression cutting details that would be hard to notice on organic pictures
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 00:24:23 The more you know
general 2020-12-09 01:22:12 No air targets boo
general 2020-12-09 01:22:59 Lol I tried air realistic in a bomber and spun out after getting off the runway
general 2020-12-09 01:23:56 Stalling is sad
general 2020-12-09 01:24:42 Do gunners still auto target?
general 2020-12-09 01:25:13 In realistic
general 2020-12-09 01:26:12 The funny part is when they hit they one shot the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 01:27:38 Not enough 8s
general 2020-12-09 01:28:21 Don‚Äôt break every part of your tank then

creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:33:11 <@!714733688084234250> WHERE ARE MY TRACKS
creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:36:03 I wanna chain a suggestion of changing rails with it
creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:38:27 I have a picture of it but I should do some cleaning up with it. I feel like I need a essay to convince people tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:12:04 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:13:50 yo how would you guys feel about the rails changing size?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:14:39 Why larger????
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:14:58 1 full
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:15:10 Thicc queues
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:15:37 Why larger trains do mean like longer?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:16:13 but why larger
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:16:54 When you crash and loose all your progress
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:19:10 I don‚Äôt get why you would want larger
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:19:38 I understand big build but the current size is quite fine for this purpose
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:22:06 You confuse me blue
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:39:47 Describe unde train
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:41:42 I‚Äôm tempted to build a joke model for regular tracks but should I actually put effort into it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:20 Is it tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:53 How
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:43:19 I literally made 10 rotors in an hour while testing my gun
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:43:44 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:43:56 One did
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:44:18 It desided its people needed it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:45:35 I physically can‚Äôt fly with them for i am too laggy
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:46:42 I‚Äôm confused on how this angles the blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:47:48 I see you tilt the rotor to tilt the blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:48:20 I would say you kinda did a loop around it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:09 Why do you have a swash plate on the tail
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:25 You do realize it‚Äôs supposed to be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:46 A swash plate is entirely useless on it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:50:14 Swash plates are for pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:50:24 that‚Äôs what they do
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:50:44 It‚Äôs literal overkill
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:51:12 You could just power the motors on the blade
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:51:46 it‚Äôs a literal translation of angle happening there
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:52:40 welp
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 04:55:02 I just realized how stumpy the nose is on my plane help
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 04:59:26 Never
creations-chat 2020-12-09 05:05:09 Yo should I line the wings of my big plane with cutters so I have the ability to decapitate things
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:07:39 Yo should I line the wings of my big plane with cutters so I have the ability to decapitate things
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:07:50 it wouldn‚Äôt look as nice tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:08:16 You lock it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:08:43 Yes but the square is much smaller than the circle
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:08:53 what why
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:10:36 The motor goes in body
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 06:10:26 I‚Äôll go with the spasm one
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 06:36:49 I can‚Äôt think of a way to change My wing folds
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 06:37:06 I‚Äôm trying to redo my folds so they lag less
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 06:38:22 All the other folds went well but I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm gonna do this one
creations-chat 2020-12-09 17:12:01 Why does it get 90
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:16:04 Why spinnana
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:18:16 yes French turrets
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:18:27 More barrels the better
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:18:45 should I make a meme turret
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:26:30 Frigets speedy boi ships that more in the line of attacking smol ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:26:41 Their guns aren‚Äôt as big
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:27:02 cruiser best
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:28:24 Make a literal catapult
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:28:54 Carrier with its own offense
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:29:09 Shoots planes at its enemies
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:30:59 It‚Äôs not kamikaze it‚Äôs just suiside bombing kamikaze is a type
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:31:10 Get yo facts straight
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:32:11 They where smart bombs
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:33:32 Except I fire bullet shields at you
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:33:46 and I have way bigger projectiles
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:34:39 Shells cost money as well
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:38:28 If I‚Äôm gonna build a battleship I‚Äôm gonna make it work and it‚Äôs gonna use a range finder
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:38:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:43:31 Range finder is easy already built one just gotta get it to flush
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 17:48:03 The true challenge is calibrating it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 23:09:59 People need to stop with the jets
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 23:10:39 be more original
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 23:11:13 There is 22 pages of MIG jets
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 23:24:22 b-29 superior

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 02:06:50 you just have to wait for a server to open and get a chance at joining said server
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 02:07:03 Who are you
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:35:58 Imagine using conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:36:47 Studs per second
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:37:01 Units per second works too
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:40:04 I haven‚Äôt myself built a conveyor drive but if they only get to 2k with multiple on a small craft and they are laggy I don‚Äôt know why I would ever use them
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:41:37 They don‚Äôt seem to have any upsides compared to a mag engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:41:55 beyond placement efficiency
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:42:42 Tell us
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 05:50:30 Before and after torpedos
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 05:51:18 Nothing like a dingy splinting a battleship in half in a single shot
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 05:52:14 They made ships wider because torpedos would literally one shot them
general 2020-12-10 06:00:53 <:Duck:606204496695001091>
general 2020-12-10 06:01:42 No
creations-chat 2020-12-10 06:03:14 Off brand Nerf
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:03:54 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:04:05 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:08:13 Burn
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 17:18:23 Red
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:00:24 Wait the lamp speed run caught on?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:00:44 hooray
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:01:36 I should probably try and run it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:03:13 Basically from a new login to the game(first time joining with said account) you touch the lamp
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:03:19 nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:03:35 I don‚Äôt know how fast that is
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:04:16 As long as you didn‚Äôt move when it ended
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:05:25 I might be cheeky and use vip2 in order to make use of gravity and pvp stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:09:28 Vip2 is Normally empty as a curtesy for people who don‚Äôt want lag and my purpose is knowing what plot I‚Äôll be on
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 18:10:10 also if I use a new account the server got to be loaded
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:43:02 I don‚Äôt got any planes currently because I don‚Äôt want to pull out the one I have and the next plane I have will be massive once it‚Äôs done
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:45:38 No more mig
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:45:45 We need a purge
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:48:05 speaking of my big plane should I line it‚Äôs wings with cutters or leave it decorative
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:49:22 I mean it‚Äôs gonna be a wing double the height of the plot on a massive plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:49:50 The wing itself is 2 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:51:19 And I want to be able to slice things in half with my plane but it won‚Äôt look as good
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 19:52:56 Maybe
creations-chat 2020-12-10 20:09:59 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/786676818974343238 over use of disconnecters can be done in 4 and it would take less space
creations-chat 2020-12-10 20:14:50 imagine deleting downvoted
creations-chat 2020-12-10 20:16:52 imagine being salty for someone taking a downvote away
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:53:15 I might detail the inside of my plane but I‚Äôm not sure if I should
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:54:00 it‚Äôs at the size of where I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 01:10:26 you would need to pester rickje for more
general 2020-12-11 01:11:49 The grammar in my suggestion is awful I think I was half awake when I wrote it
general 2020-12-11 01:12:30 readability
general 2020-12-11 01:12:54 Crossout
general 2020-12-11 01:13:16 oh
general 2020-12-11 01:13:28 Remember when rocket league was free
general 2020-12-11 01:13:57 and then people crashed their entire server by creating accounts
general 2020-12-11 01:14:45 they made it cost money for a while because the servers couldn‚Äôt get updated in time
general 2020-12-11 01:15:00 because of how many people where buying the game
creations-chat 2020-12-11 01:19:58 Only 1k
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 01:21:38 that‚Äôs a you problem
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 01:22:01 What did you do
general 2020-12-11 05:23:15 Large servers that don‚Äôt got many ranks have seizure at the end of the list of online people
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:27:29 He the swash plate man
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:29:07 I just thought of a simple swash plate design
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:29:49 it would require 8 moving parts
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:33:36 The only problem I see is it being super aggressive
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:41:52 so I doubt I‚Äôll be airborne before glitches arise
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:45:55 Yes place a wing in a hangar
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:49:52 Maybe I can do it in five
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:50:41 lock motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:51:40 unlock the lock motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:52:56 No fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 19:40:46 someone complaining on designer ranks being too high and he got solid proof but all i can say is advertizing

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:51:59 There 7 discussions at once wait your turn
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:53:00 Then don‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:56:27 That‚Äôs a problem if ya know the ships faster than you and has torps
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:57:06 with a sub?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:57:55 You‚Äôll get disarmed by said boat and it won‚Äôt help with the torps
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:58:15 Also you‚Äôll give away your location making aiming easier
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:59:38 yeah that‚Äôs true
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:00:20 Im quite bad at aim but that‚Äôs from lag
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:00:56 Missiles need to be above water to fire and will die if they hit water
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:01:55 You won‚Äôt but still the boat will take it out or just use it the line torps up
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:16 how fast is sub
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:02:53 understand able
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:04:41 missiles help by being good at overall damage but if you have problems with speed they won‚Äôt save you
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:04:56 also you can use regular glass as a sonar
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:05:32 if a sub that size gets hit by a toro it‚Äôs gonna die
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:06:37 sub do sub things it does it‚Äôs job it just won‚Äôt survive many targets
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:07:10 Like anything in the air or on the ground or that travels faster than 28 in the water
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:09:00 Gun with wings is an assault glider
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 02:04:06 3 wings?

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:17:45 I must increase size
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:28:56 Aw man my plane is smaller by a few blocks it must be bigger
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:35:01 Because it can be
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:35:40 An aero foil
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:36:17 Is there a middle ground the first looks too flat but the second is just super sharp
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:36:33 I‚Äôll go with bachelorette number 2

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:41:49 My plane currently is 13 by 13 but I think I‚Äôll make it go to 15 by 17 or higher
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:42:39 Not having to worry about hidden folds helps
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:44:13 See you‚Äôll easily be able to fit inside
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:44:17 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:44:30 I have lots of wide space to use
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:46:04 We could just ask them to work on the code instead of giving us new blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:47:12 Unless maddattack doesn‚Äôt put notes in his code I think rickje would be capable of making it easier to work on
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:50:40 Complications with making wider
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 03:50:53 Eh

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 04:01:28 It‚Äôs purpose is to get the power to a blade shot off during pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 04:01:41 it‚Äôs flair
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 04:02:14 yes?

general 2020-12-15 05:22:23 like mine goes from off to spark and then to high
general 2020-12-15 05:22:47 so I can effectively twist it on
general 2020-12-15 05:23:27 What I mean is I can make it spark before I let it have glass

creations-chat 2020-12-15 20:06:59 plane flew
general 2020-12-15 20:12:29 So if one was to build a new map for plane crazy would rickje accept it?
general 2020-12-15 20:13:31 Assuming the plots stay the same size at the same coordinates
general 2020-12-15 20:16:04 Depression
general 2020-12-15 20:16:57 yes but a problem with using them is how the plots are set in
general 2020-12-15 20:18:33 inject carosine into your skin instead
general 2020-12-15 20:21:55 so for a new map to have the best chance to be accepted by rickje it would need the plots to be left the same size and distance from each other as well as having space for things like the lava for summer event
general 2020-12-15 20:22:52 It doesn‚Äôt say anything
general 2020-12-15 20:23:20 Oh?

general 2020-12-17 20:07:20 When you go to grab the snow blaster you have to turn it off to enter
general 2020-12-17 20:07:42 This in its self takes out lots of particles
general 2020-12-17 20:08:00 but if you let it and don‚Äôt break it

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 21:46:47 Like a hover bike that works like a hover bike
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 21:47:43 Not a phony hover bike
creations-chat 2020-12-17 22:57:17 <@!658033058502410240> oh I‚Äôm sorry you think that‚Äôs a lot of time.

You have to realize that time isn‚Äôt a factor of effort or skill
creations-chat 2020-12-17 22:59:22 Because it is probably
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:01:04 Yo what if a built a jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:01:16 like a mig
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:01:32 I bet no one has ever done that before
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:05:50 Should I hide missiles in the wing of my biig plane?

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:10:42 Naw 4
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:11:03 the sides have marks so is a squeezed disc
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:11:20 and then the engines are then folded in place
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:11:54 Engines look a bit too long for just one fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:12:07 But I guess they can fit
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:12:16 so yeah 3 folds
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:19:00 I mean I guess it‚Äôs good enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:19:04 Not as big

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:08:13 here‚Äôs a pro tip
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:08:24 For rotors without swash plates
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:08:35 just in power the bottom motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:08:46 magic

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:09:18 that‚Äôs what springs do
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:09:36 If auto is left on they are button press
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:09:48 If off, it‚Äôs toggle
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:10:34 they have a good use for guns
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:11:03 the break weld is really nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:11:15 as it can make it start locked
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:11:51 altho it has a slow retract
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 04:14:00 That‚Äôs a you problem

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 22:28:56 Or in blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 22:30:20 It‚Äôs like searching for the paint block
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 22:30:46 You look in blocks but forget the sub tab block exists
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 22:32:36 If you can‚Äôt find it it‚Äôs probably in a sub tab

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:13:53 the mess up
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:14:14 it‚Äôs over 255
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:14:36 it wasn‚Äôt valid
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:15:16 You just need to find your own code
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:15:39 But not I know how to really confuse people
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:18:06 we got a coo| arctic camo color 216 270 248
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:19:06 It‚Äôs a nice slightly shaded light blue on white
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:19:22 totally not a joke color
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:20:30 why ask when one can stalk
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:28:22 I love being teared into a knot
general 2020-12-19 05:29:30 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-12-19 05:29:39 Oof
general 2020-12-19 05:29:52 I just looked at my ping
general 2020-12-19 05:29:54 It crashed
general 2020-12-19 05:30:09 19051.27 ms
general 2020-12-19 05:30:16 op
general 2020-12-19 05:30:21 Not a crash
general 2020-12-19 05:43:23 Yay
general 2020-12-19 05:44:33 Still to my opinion that III and IV should also have values
general 2020-12-19 05:44:58 I II are too small to get good scores without it being a joke
general 2020-12-19 05:47:25 speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:05:58 regulations are lies
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:08:24 I would feel better getting hit by planes with cannons rather than missiles
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:08:41 And more
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:09:15 Well it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just that
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:11:07 Well getting hit by missiles takes out my entire vehicle most the time so getting hit by cannons means they don‚Äôt just have to effectively one shot me while I‚Äôm trying to fight someone else
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:11:42 also locked motors that move are still welded when power is stopped
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:04 add drop to it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:19 newbies can‚Äôt aim
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:32 auto cannons are fine
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:13:20 Shredders exist it‚Äôs not like shredders with auto cannons make much a difference
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:13:41 hell
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:15:38 shredders are a style of melee craft in the game that are a nuisance to public pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:15:48 some are actually good
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:16:00 Most are just pests
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:16:49 I‚Äôm tempted to make a shredder to see how good I could make one
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:17:17 well
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:18:28 most shredders suck at their existence
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:19:40 fuck I started too late got third
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:19:48 ack
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:54:15 So I was originally gonna do the 13 Yule lads but I wasn‚Äôt sure how I was gonna spin them
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:54:39 I‚Äôve changed my mind to a tree with a twist
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:56:34 Is this a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:58:13 Helium is one way
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:58:27 But it disqualifies you
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:58:54 He might be purple but I have heli tech
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:59:25 You don‚Äôt have it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 21:59:54 So does mine
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 22:00:09 Excuses
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 22:00:46 My recording are 1fps at minimum graphics so I speed them up

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:09:54 Cool
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:10:26 Turing right on a heli I can assume
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:11:10 uhh if it‚Äôs a thruster blades it‚Äôs from resistance
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:11:33 it can also be from having the lower motor powered which is never a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:12:30 letting the rotor be independent as much as you can is always a good idea
general 2020-12-20 01:12:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:13:23 It doesn‚Äôt seem like the rotation is that bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:13:29 From text
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:13:40 Ooh
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:13:51 Are they all at the same speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:14:08 Then it‚Äôs collision
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:15:08 if they are all the same speed the only way of having random torque on a setup like that is if there‚Äôs friction on one of the blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:16:32 UWU....
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:17:10 It would slow down a motor making it spin
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:17:46 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:17:54 I would need to see it then
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:19:19 lol

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 04:54:09 That is sand
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 05:05:58 More engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 05:36:51 Springs don‚Äôt like to move when not triggered
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:24:26 More
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:25:23 My wings are gonna need one more fold as well
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:26:27 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:29:19 I have no guide on mine it‚Äôs just a big plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:29:34 so it‚Äôs proportions are bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:32:12 I plan on finishing it then going for a bigger and better plane eventually
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:32:31 Planet fall
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:22 you will be far over
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:36 maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:34:05 I have built mine with lag in mind and it‚Äôs almost at 4K already while being a shell
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:35:36 Free fallin yea
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:50:35 Funni plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:50:43 You can‚Äôt hold other planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 08:15:19 It‚Äôs called legacy glass
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 08:24:44 Wait are you messing with someone‚Äôs build on them?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 08:25:03 I‚Äôm confused
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 21:01:01 so how‚Äôs it goin
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 03:57:24 Bro
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 04:12:09 You mean the spar pot
creations-chat 2020-12-21 04:19:22 What most people do is use it even when they don‚Äôt have to
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:32:22 My biig plane (wip)
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:32:33 What do you guys think about it so far?
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 05:34:37 Such usefull information
creations-chat 2020-12-21 07:57:10 A biig plane need thoughts on its current shape
general 2020-12-21 07:59:55 <@504076583305478153> there‚Äôs a technique for this, it‚Äôs called using a control panel
creations-chat 2020-12-21 08:01:18 Blocke? Bruh the pain that implies
creations-chat 2020-12-21 08:04:26 I refuse to think of the front being blocky
creations-chat 2020-12-21 08:07:55 There is not enough wedges in the game to fix it
 Also half the front is missing and the can‚Äôt see the design on the bottom
creations-chat 2020-12-21 08:10:52 What jet?
bug-reports 2020-12-21 08:12:39 I‚Äôve only ran into it when moving
creations-chat 2020-12-21 08:15:33 Oh your out classed heavily
help 2020-12-21 08:19:23 The friction test kinda sad
bug-reports 2020-12-21 08:19:53 Weird bug not that important
bug-reports 2020-12-21 08:20:24 When a block is set to ice and then changed back it keeps the weight
bug-reports 2020-12-21 08:20:48 effecting it‚Äôs buoyancy is how I found it
bug-reports 2020-12-21 08:21:29 By reloading the creation fixes it but it was weird
general 2020-12-21 08:22:40 You had to mess with it
general 2020-12-21 08:23:02 roblox
general 2020-12-21 08:23:08 Become racist
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 08:23:50 Details
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 08:24:01 Lots more
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:15:07 Yo that plane up there is super small
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:15:50 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:16:11 Hehehe
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:16:43 well leaving and rejoining is super dumb
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:17:08 You do know tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:21:20 So shredders
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:21:39 sorry shredders with guns
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:23:04 shredders are a category for annoying drones that fly directly at their target usually using cutters but can also carry other weaponss
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:23:57 ya blacklist cubes
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:24:34 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:24:55 Flying turrets?
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:25:33 all I can think of is a box plane that has turrets and anchors to fire
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:26:58 l√∂ng
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:27:25 He in his zeplin phase
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:29:28 when most people see shredders they are most likely to find one that is dysfunctional and sucks at its life
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:29:47 they aren‚Äôt put together with thought
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:30:26 many of them can Ôøº barely damage their target
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:30:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:30:45 Well
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:30:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:31:00 It‚Äôs just bad keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:31:38 for planes I would normally use W and S
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:32:06 shift and ctrl
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:32:59 you just need to revamp your keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:33:42 I use P [ ] and \  for setup
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:29:37 The ones with winter wheels
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:34:29 Woah nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:34:51 Cool
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:37:13 Can I have half of it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:37:26 don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôll grow back
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:37:46 I need at least 50%
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:37:59 To make it worth shipping
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:38:24 it‚Äôs expensive to relocate livers
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:39:07 Don‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt need it for a gamer pc
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:39:24 I just need it for my
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:39:30 Collection
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:39:58 Yes shoot guns at your enemies
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:40:37 autoloaders are super eazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:41:24 my helivolver has an auto loader
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:42:30 you don‚Äôt have a choice HE
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:43:54 Bro your gonna be using explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:44:24 The autoloaders for those don‚Äôt take up any space
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:44:51 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:44:58 that‚Äôs called a hopper
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:45:38 autoloaders need to set the ball into place without the risk of spillage
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:46:23 Again my helivolver has 8 rounds and it still takes up a seriously low amount of space
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:47:23 It‚Äôs a 1 by 2 by 5 space
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:48:06 one of the spaces is used by a magnet for firing
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:49:52 The barrel is off set so a piston is used to set the pellet into place for firing and hold it in place for movement
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:52:03 Fold good
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 03:52:18 prelock the joints
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:00:47 Blood
creations-chat 2020-12-22 04:04:25 Its blocky
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:07:07 don‚Äôt you want to shoot something out of the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:08:15 then what are you gonna shoot
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:09:38 How?
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:09:55 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:09:57 Boooo
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:10:07 That‚Äôs laziness
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 04:11:24 it accomplishes nothing
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 19:10:38 What if it was bigger
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:46:13 as a joke competition we can see who‚Äôs the best at flying an armed starter plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:46:46 as a gag I do I skip tutorials on games for fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:46:55 if I can
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:47:45 sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know if they give you extra rewards if you do them but if there‚Äôs no signs of that I try to skip it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:48:08 if I can‚Äôt to do it as fast as possible
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 22:52:35 kiddo that‚Äôs a big ship you got there
creations-chat 2020-12-22 22:58:08 <@!709475765963718688> I would suggest a little more time between each creation post to there‚Äôs a clear line between each creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 23:04:18 we have all
general 2020-12-24 01:40:34 Aw man I was hoping to vibe in ant sim but the announcement was at 9am...
general 2020-12-24 01:41:10 I typed and then left and then finished typing
general 2020-12-24 01:41:21 bruh why
general 2020-12-24 01:42:06 I literally went to another channel did it say I was still typing?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 01:43:41 Boats do have noses
general 2020-12-24 01:51:56 What if I typed a long message and wait a super long time to send it
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 02:20:00 Another suggestion about walking under water
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 02:23:10 I want to tell them how hard to do that in games
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 02:25:40 Also it‚Äôs a roblox thing
general 2020-12-24 02:27:11 only spring guns have recoil
general 2020-12-24 02:27:25 Yes
general 2020-12-24 02:27:36 it‚Äôs 13+ not 18+
general 2020-12-24 02:28:03 The 13+ is for discord rules
general 2020-12-24 02:30:55 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 05:37:56 I don‚Äôt understand
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 05:38:06 Whyyyyyy
general 2020-12-24 05:40:17 Decal blocks are cool but I feel like in a way they are gonna be a cheap way to detail
general 2020-12-24 05:40:34 No
general 2020-12-24 05:41:27 just think you could just take a picture then make a box with pictures as details instead of actually building something
general 2020-12-24 05:41:40 no
general 2020-12-24 05:41:59 more space in chest now
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:41:00 Why do people suggest planes without elevators so much
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:41:19 It‚Äôs such a common request
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:47:32 ah the furry aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:48:44 We do not speak of them
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:49:27 that‚Äôs what I do
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:06:00 Lol imagine not knowing how to clip
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:07:06 As a not well known fact
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:07:31 You have 1 block of space below the ground
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:09:30 so if you hit build height
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:09:51 Clip all your blocks into the ground for more height
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:11:15 I don‚Äôt know why there is but there is
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:27:52 Eeee inefficiency
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:28:16 So much inefficiency
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:31:23 It is
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:32:05 I‚Äôm talking about the space used and amount of motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:32:17 And disconnecters
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:32:36 it‚Äôs a massive space waste
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:32:50 it is
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:33:56 people being inefficient doesn‚Äôt make it less inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:36:20 people being inefficient doesn‚Äôt make it less inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:37:20 you can half it
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:38:57 I‚Äôll find the time later not in the mood right now

plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:41:00 Hm you can‚Äôt search | up
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 07:41:05 huh
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:01:38 You gotta be kidding me his motor tower isn‚Äôt straight
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:02:59 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:03:44 The bet I made above
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:04:21 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/791570600350842921
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:23:52 I swear I have sent 50% of my time trying to Ôøº decipher this build
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:24:25 Color
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:28:21 I‚Äôm gonna finish this tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 09:36:01 There‚Äôs like 3 blocks left to place but I want sleep so bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:11:34 Ok I finished the model finally
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:11:56 just gotta edit some images then I‚Äôll put it here
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:12:10 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:12:29 That‚Äôs not what + do
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:13:07 It‚Äôs supposed to be to the power
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:14:48 e is also a constant
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:16:09 15 zeros would be weird number*10^(how many zeros)
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:16:27 why?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:18:35 yes the one of the tutorial build hovers?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:20:07 its nt that hard
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:20:14 and its not a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:20:34 a glitch is a unexpected interation
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:21:04 motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:21:10 l o c k
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:22:05 Here is that model
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:22:06 
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:22:06 
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:22:07 
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:23:21 <@!467565971918422017>might as well tag you <@!251880826386513924> here is that bet
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:23:55 motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:24:36 an old argument on calling someone inefficient with space
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:25:00 all the signs would be replaced with text
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:25:23 and be made invisible just in case
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:26:21 signs don't have the same conections as text so i cant test it without ripping it appart
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:26:41 luckily they dont do much
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:36:31 f-17
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:38:07 Mag engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:38:18 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:38:37 is it tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:39:00 yes but
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:39:22 people with fight you with conveyer engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:39:44 also mag drives slide more
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:40:24 You somehow have acceleration instead of a single speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:40:46 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:40:52 Multiple
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:41:01 To many types and sizes
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:41:17 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:42:08 also you can tone down the mag engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:42:18 So it has a lower max speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:42:44 and use other engines so you don‚Äôt stall on it
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:43:02 it‚Äôs mag piston
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:43:07 or mag motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:43:26 One magnet pulls the entire creation
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:43:42 it‚Äôs not laggy at all
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:43:53 well
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:44:15 it‚Äôs not as bad as other options
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:45:29 Just use the prop your using to go 31 with and set a mag engine to make you have the desired max speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:49:04 No exceptions
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:50:21 I need a sub again
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:51:11 Russia?
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:52:02 Wait a minute
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:52:56 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:53:16 That‚Äôs no
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 22:54:02 I don‚Äôt trust this statement
general 2020-12-25 00:48:06 you get grass

general 2020-12-25 01:01:43 How big does sub need to make to qualify as sub commander
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:04:08 How thicc of sub do I need
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:04:42 For the rank
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:07:40 Guess I‚Äôll make a new sub
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:13:51 What if we

plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:34:55 I have none of those
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:50:48 The debate came off your creation so I tagged you so you could at least look at it as it‚Äôs based off yours
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:50:59 creative property
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:54:08 Oki
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:56:43 finally landed my bullet

bug-reports 2020-12-25 05:17:32 That is the ice spawn
bug-reports 2020-12-25 05:18:23 I would still call it a glitch
bug-reports 2020-12-25 05:23:34 If your a boat it‚Äôs a pain to get spawned on ice
bug-reports 2020-12-25 05:23:56 And if you want to spawn on ice it‚Äôs hard to get it on there
general 2020-12-25 05:25:52 suname help us
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 05:27:13 Aaaahhh
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 05:30:36 All

plane-crazy 2020-12-26 22:54:59 Revelation
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 23:41:54 Is there some secret to having planes trail you?
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 23:42:23 it doesn‚Äôt look hard at all yet somehow people love them
creations-chat 2020-12-28 01:51:11 U-boat not boat enough
They are more boat then sub
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:57:11 Blades have drag
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:57:25 Lots of drag
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:57:34 so much drag
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 01:59:42 Girl choppers?
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:00:10 I never know choppers where so sexist
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:00:33 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:01:06 You‚Äôll need 6 keybinds on it tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:01:14 well
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:01:16 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:01:19 Nvm
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:02:04 Helis take up lots of key binds
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:05:37 Hahah
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 02:05:56 Only 25
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 04:44:42 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 04:44:54 you can‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 04:45:18 By illegal we mean you should never justify using them
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 04:45:41 also there is to many of them
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 04:46:04 You can justify murder you can‚Äôt justify shredders
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 05:07:31 Then make it :p
creations-chat 2020-12-28 18:13:54 The one that isn‚Äôt dying inside
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:13:54 Nice friend you are
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:16:26 Should I make a heli that uses only one rotor and a single motor to fly?
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:17:03 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:17:47 the main problem is powering the rotor with enough force to stay in the air
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:18:17 I tried it before when modeling on my helivolver
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:18:50 Wings cause a stupid amount of drag even if they are flat
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:19:32 So to make the rotor work and look nice wasn‚Äôt happening with the space I had
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:22:01 I probably won‚Äôt be able to get it in the air due to roblox glitches on my swash plate
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:22:18 well I‚Äôll run it on a lower gravity
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:22:45 Lag don‚Äôt like moving blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:24:54 You need more detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:25:28 Extra detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:25:32 paint
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:25:47 try it out
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:27:25 It will
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:52:10 Question should I make my swash plate encase my rotor ‚Äúcore‚Äù, or should I do some welding on fix the problem
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 20:55:02 Naw I‚Äôll make the ‚Äúcore‚Äù stack the swash plate
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 21:00:26 I am sad to say it has not
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 21:48:08 Ok then
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:08:50 I would say give it camo paint
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:09:16 No they don‚Äôt Mr.engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:09:30 Custom
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:12:48 Paint the engine in ice
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:13:10 It will give it a shine add make it super light
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 22:20:40 I see what‚Äôs happening yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:03:10 Oh no the swash plate I used isnt Omni directional
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:07:09 I might have a fix
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:07:23 key word might
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:15:53 Welp the current design doesn‚Äôt work
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:15:03 Blame anything physics or graphics on roblox
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:15:23 you know how glass sees through water
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:15:35 That is literally one line of code to fix
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:16:16 it‚Äôs a layering issue that can be solved by dragging a line of code
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:16:27 Fixed makes it not work with movement
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:16:43 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:17:02 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:17:09 it shouldn‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:17:29 What do you mean by bend
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:18:08 What direction is it pointing
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:19:14 All jets need angle motor locking to survive
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:30:28 Ok

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:51:51 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:52:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:54:35 it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:54:40 prototype of my single motor powers heli setup
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:55:40 This swash plate works in concept but only in one axis and has weird physics
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:55:54 The orange is a giant cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:56:43 It‚Äôs not a harrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:57:10 It‚Äôs a larrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:58:29 The orange cylinder of wings is to give tourque to the blades for lift
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:58:33 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:03:42 150 of what size?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:03:54 smart bombs?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:04:52 That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt even need a fold
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:20:30 Should I continue lacing the wing of my big plane with cutter into the next fold or just continue one without them
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:03:10 Smol
general 2020-12-29 04:21:35 So wait sub commander and floating fortress are unobtainable then?

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 01:35:56 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 01:36:04 It‚Äôs a force shutdown
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 01:36:22 You can use it to get rid of outdated servers
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 01:38:12 If you make a script for cleaning old servers so more update servers don‚Äôt get hit

plane-crazy 2021-01-04 20:55:11 Oh that‚Äôs normal
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 20:55:49 What‚Äôs really wierd is when the creation is lagging behind the tracks
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 20:56:32 You just gonna need to find a better track
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 20:57:08 You could ask to see other designs
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 20:59:17 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:33:19 Wow you finished your plane with out testing
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:33:50 Auto saves happen when you spawn in a creation
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:34:32 They have durations and maybe a check if you‚Äôve placed a block
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:34:53 Also auto saves happen when you mass delete
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:38:18 Your not allowed O
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:38:34 it could be a loading issue
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:38:46 they have a safety
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 04:39:02 That exists for some reason
the-dump 2021-01-05 05:32:17 Remember when a bunch of cosplayers and 5 idiots showed up outside of Area 51

general 2021-01-05 23:07:39 Lol the suggestion I got warned for is still up and yet to be responded to
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:15:17 Lol two of those planes above look like made in ksp
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 18:36:29 Trash
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:47:19 mag drives are better than hover engines and conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:47:40 They don‚Äôt lag they get you to stupidly high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:47:56 a single one can get you to 6k
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:56:12 they are not
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:56:32 I did a comparison
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:57:00 The only lag from using mag drives is from the creation itself
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:01:46 https://youtu.be/tDnVSqabHbE

the-dump 2021-01-11 00:04:12 Blood?
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:04:58 I still wouldn‚Äôt say it qualifies
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:12:20 doesn‚Äôt qualify for politicalÔøº either
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:15:55 It has to do with the emote pog champ and statements from its creator
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:16:36 the meme I shared has to do with reactions to said event so it does not have a side making it not political
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:17:46 removed because of ‚Äúsupporting his statements‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:56:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:56:48 but it‚Äôs not lag?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:57:32 my helivolver shots explode in contact really well but in testing sometimes they don‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:58:34 it might have to do with the propelling force still on it when it hits the target
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:59:19 because the speed on my helivover shots are high yet they don‚Äôt suffer from that at all
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 16:59:48 oh so do mine but the explosion always happens relative to the target it hits
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:00:13 like if I hit a moving target the explosion will be off to the side
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:00:23 Right where I hit them
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:00:43 I have
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:01:16 no they suck
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:02:12 just shoot tnt balls at a slower rate
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 17:03:17 because all of my shots have been compensated on the lag dealing the damage they would of even as they are half a second off
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:36:55 thruster landing 3 boosters at the same time sounds like hell
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:49:40 Already does
bot-central 2021-01-12 04:18:00 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:35:11 shoot it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 20:15:21 can someone make a complex shell for larger guns?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 20:15:50 I wonder if you can make a shell that turns sideways
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 20:16:54 anything better than tnt balls would be nice

plane-crazy 2021-01-19 23:12:01 its like a fracture
bot-central 2021-01-21 01:38:50 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 01:44:34 only need one tail
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 05:41:22 I don‚Äôt wanna fix my giant plane but i kinda want it to at least get me expert to make it not feel like a waste
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:13:21 for gamerpoints use motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:13:50 visual only
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:15:51 they cant fix it going under or making it more usable
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:16:34 it‚Äôs effectively and extra block of hight
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:17:42 well that would be one way to fix it lower the build plate by 1
creations-chat 2021-01-27 04:01:17 pigeon
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:02:32 not sure to say if this is a bug report or not but it would be nice if ballast tanks activated faster when hitting water, it would make the drop height for torpedos much more lenient
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:03:12 its like an effect that may not be intentional but has been around for a long time
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:04:57 a ballast tank only has effects in water and the way it works is by staying on a certain height
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:05:56 when you drop a torpedo the ballast tank takes a while to activate making it liable to go under most boats
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:06:49 ballast tanks dont use physics to work they use script code
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:07:33 I have a boat and you not miss the target they are dropped just above the surface to hit averagely low boats
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:08:20 most people will use helium to give their boat hull a maximum depth of 0.5 blocks
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:10:18 I have trouble hitting those targets with a low mounted torpedo. how do you imagine hitting them with a plane
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:10:49 ...
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:11:09 be quiet
plane-crazy 2021-02-01 19:45:54 bruh plane ranks are just pictures

plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:46:27 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:47:17 i think you need to make the front and back sharper
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:47:39 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:47:56 ah i need to get an expert rank
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:48:38 what expert rank should I go for
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:49:48 ?
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:50:03 well ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:51:29 still think it needs to be more jagged
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:54:02 you need to build the shape how it looks not to its proportions
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:54:47 like it needs to be identifiable not accurate
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:54:57 better
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:55:14 well if you use extra
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 21:55:47 you can effectively half the space of most motor locks
general 2021-03-14 22:03:47 snap chat also isn‚Äôt fun if you attempt to look at a group conversation and you have to fully watch every meme before you can see if it was text they sent

bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:14:28 its funny how many errors are in some games
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:16:38 it is
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:17:24 in most games you‚Äôll find what the most recent update has broken that the dev of that game has yet to fix
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:18:23 apparently
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:19:08 it might be a dev event that they can trigger
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 22:20:10 oh?
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:21:40 if your gonna use thruster blades theres no point of having it be Coaxial as well
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:25:16 the two main ways of achieving a working heli blade is to make it Coaxial(two sets of blades) or to use a form of propulsion on the blades(I call thruster blades)
 you dont need both for your heli to fly and they both are hated in some way.
 coaxial is the more hated due to it looking easier when they are both effectively generic
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:30:39 work all the same and are way less bulky
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 22:48:23 sounds about right
general 2021-03-14 23:12:45 yo mods is there any block rules to sub commander?
general 2021-03-14 23:13:51 its an unlisted rank
general 2021-03-14 23:15:45 i would say thats true but i think i could get around that
general 2021-03-14 23:24:35 among us sus in Minecraft
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 01:20:56 i tried to put some kind of landing system on my helivolver and underestimated how heavy it is
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 02:03:41 what is this conversation
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 04:57:40 i don‚Äôt understand how people vote in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 04:59:40 its like somehow the majority of people who vote in suggestions don‚Äôt vote on weather its good for the game but if it effects what they use
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:01:21 like how does a vote kick system on a server that constantly complains about toxic people in public servers so opposed to it
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:01:45 i understand people not wanting it but not that much
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:03:27 I would hope to think thats what he‚Äôs focusing on
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:04:14 that sounds like hell to code
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:05:16 players are tracked but not in the way where a radar could be easily made
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:06:45 if you are to make a radar making it show a map isn‚Äôt that hard showing anything that moves is hell
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:07:37 oh like a player tag?
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:09:47 ooh like points of interest
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 05:10:20 maybe
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:03:20 sometimes your auto save looks like what you just built when its actually an outdated version sometimes
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:04:27 not a bug just a thing that makes you feel like something didn‚Äôt save
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:05:33 really only a problem when modifying controls
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 19:31:41 ya know i kinda want to make a propeller with a changeable angle of attack

If you want to have a high score, you need to use motor lock

general 2021-03-18 04:08:52 like what if the person who kills you used 5.56 to kill you?
general 2021-03-18 04:09:05 are you just gonna leave him with less ammo?
general 2021-03-18 04:10:03 what if is aim is trash and he uses an entire inventory worth of ammo?

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:50:45 its weird mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:51:39 it requires lots of geometry and sudo connections to work
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:53:35 I would say better than angled motor lock but it requires mechanical knowledge over what regular locking requires
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 02:58:31 sifi turret

plane-crazy 2021-07-25 22:18:29 it seems like the wheels of trains are super genaric
plane-crazy 2021-07-25 22:19:27 its just how the train is resting on the tracks

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 00:01:16 yo how do you guys approach the wheels of the train
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 00:02:12 i just casually cling the the walls of the rails ignore the top section
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 00:02:29 ah
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 00:02:39 the ‚Äúcustom train wheels‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 00:03:12 mine effectively looks like if you only used the bottom wheel and added suspension

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 02:13:17 I would say its the torque of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 02:13:52 since the power of a motor is the combined torque and speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 02:18:06 mono means one
and rail means rail

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 18:56:46 not sure
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 18:57:19 i swear it used to pop up
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 18:59:00 still have no clue why this server hates vote-kick for some reason
bug-reports 2021-07-27 19:01:27 it might have been an old bug but all i remember of locked pistons is the head falling out
creations-chat 2021-07-27 19:03:33 your right their both boats
general 2021-07-27 19:04:56 interesting conversation here
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 19:16:19 nope
bot-central 2021-07-27 20:11:53 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 20:13:19 already a thing we technically got lenses
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 02:20:41 how to get upvotes fast
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 04:26:48 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 20:15:26 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:08:10 conveyor engines kinda suck due to how much they lag and break physics
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:08:28 I would rather use mag engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:08:49 the way it makes you move causes lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:09:54 make sure to not have loose bits in the magnets radius
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 16:16:39 2 devs?

plane-crazy 2021-08-11 16:18:09 you know
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 16:18:18 the standard code slave
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 16:18:52 counts as a dev while still no in charge of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 16:19:13 words
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 01:15:12 Its like one of those cutscenes vs gameplay
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 23:25:59 there‚Äôs a hole in your left wing.

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 06:32:19 how is the plane crazy life?
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 06:34:07 tbh shredder evolution is a fickle thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 06:34:45 it happens but they like to evolve harmful traits erasing all of their progress
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 06:35:49 yep
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:49:20 now press undo
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:52:10 every shredder is the handicapped version of an outdated one
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 03:53:49 ya see people who use shredder normally follow the rules of ‚ÄúI changed a fee details, so now it is original.‚Äù

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:14:10 did they black list you?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:35:24 what is wrong with this picture

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:37:31 vip?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:37:34 private
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 02:38:39 theres also way for damage in there than just the valve missng
creations-chat 2021-12-16 06:53:30 how's this?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 04:13:25 rate the shittyness. Is my mini tank worth posting?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 04:17:40 The turret is kinda big, but it is the best so far I can make it functional and still look somewhat decent
creations-chat 2021-12-17 04:21:41 maybe lighter colours makes the firework look worse
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:25:27 how does one use cutters to cut your on creation?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:26:01 gee thanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 04:26:23 how do i get the cutter to actually cut

creations-chat 2021-12-17 05:24:36 I'm glad your plot asked
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 00:35:07 insanity
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:38:52 how do some of you deal with the torque issue mono axial helis?
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:39:42 yeah coaxial does not have  a dificult torque issue to comecome
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:41:41 the torque plays in if you attempt to rotate the heli and the blades angle it at 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:41:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:42:09 only a few blocks have different weight
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:42:17 most are the exact same
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:43:08 that is your own computer spazing due to less weight
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:44:53 that isn't how the wings work
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 06:22:49 my attempts to have every challenge build in one single creation is going great
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 06:26:59 yes
