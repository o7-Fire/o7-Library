general 2020-05-12 21:24:18 is there no hacker report channel
general 2020-05-13 03:02:12 aeronautical V engineer is literally impossible for a lot of people

general 2020-05-13 03:03:25 <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
general 2020-05-13 03:04:12 I use a laptop, and the laptop can't handle anything above 600 blocks
general 2020-05-13 03:04:38 rip
general 2020-05-13 03:04:51 I've built a plane that was 1100 blocks
general 2020-05-13 03:05:06 it was the phantom from star wars of course
general 2020-05-13 03:06:00 my computer couldn't handle the 1100 blocks, lagged, and would only render like half a chunk
general 2020-05-13 03:06:30 I have no idea what to call it
general 2020-05-13 03:06:39 so I call it a chunk
general 2020-05-13 03:07:23 the only engine I have only made is the magnet engine
general 2020-05-13 03:08:32 I took a previous plane, threw out the rockets, slapped in a magnet engine, painted it black and called it the stealth mobile
general 2020-05-13 03:09:11 8.4 million pounds of thrust can't even compare to having a plane literally made of rockets
