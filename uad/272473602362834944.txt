creations-chat 2022-06-15 01:23:14 same dimensions?
general 2022-07-17 20:54:49 there might be people here from places other than the US
general 2022-07-17 20:55:56 I made a big map in studio for a game I was gonna make that was similar but never finished the placement system
general 2022-07-17 20:56:26 what
general 2022-07-17 20:56:30 how
general 2022-07-17 20:57:01 first of all different map, second of all different game mechanics similar idea
general 2022-07-17 20:57:26 and if that counts as copying then Minecraft can sue plane crazy for copying
general 2022-07-17 20:58:03 because what I was making was about as similar to plane crazy as minecraft is to plane crazy
general 2022-07-17 20:58:23 and plane crazy is a copy of build a hideout and sword fight technically as well
general 2022-07-17 20:58:39 both similar ideas
general 2022-07-17 20:58:58 both are plot based sandbox games which is what I was making
general 2022-07-17 20:59:26 ill take picture of the map I made if I can find it
general 2022-07-17 20:59:55 exactly so what I was making was not a copy
general 2022-07-17 21:00:21 its not
general 2022-07-17 21:01:13 cause people are saying the map I made is a copy cause I tried to make a plot based placement game but got a bit bored
