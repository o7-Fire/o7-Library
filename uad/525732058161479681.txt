plane-crazy 2020-08-24 18:04:31 Lol thats alot of stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 18:05:02 I dont know how to do it with the training wheels though still pretty knew
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 18:09:21 okay its pretty B A D but here it is
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 04:36:53 <@!217336009455566848> can we get harpoons ever?or grappling guns for hooking onto other builds or mountains
general 2021-01-29 15:47:01 <@!217336009455566848> Can you see individual peoples saves and control them? if so can you go to my "USS Budgie" and undo it? I just accidently got rid of my aircraft carrier that took me more than a month to finish and I didnt realize until a day ago and the undo isnt working
general 2021-02-09 22:56:33 Hey rick, we need a  radar system and radar jammer or something that will make you unseen on radars
general 2021-02-09 22:58:52 It'd be cool for stealth planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:54:02 Does anyone know what combination of engines has about the same power as a huge rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:54:39 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:54:52 I tried even one rocket and it was too fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:55:09 I want to make a VTol Jet but im extremely bad at it
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:55:21 And I want it to point down
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:55:33 I would but then it wouldn't look as good
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:56:10 I'd use hover pad but idk if it works while motorlocked into blocks to cover it
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:56:58 will it work if I motorlock blocks to cover the hovers?
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:57:25 Im still relatively new
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:57:53 mm
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:58:03 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 03:58:09 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 04:32:14 So I made a system where the bottom of the plane opens (only the back) to allow the back engine to point downwards and still look really good. Now I need to work on the actual plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 04:33:39 that dudes insult tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 06:02:41 I have a VTOL jet ive been working on and it doesn't have enough power but I cant make it anymore powerful without it having too much power
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 06:11:41 Any tips
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 07:05:48 Elon Dusk

general 2021-07-16 07:00:38 ive seen some stuff where it has mouse and custom control panel surfaces? can someone explain how to do this or send me a tutorial?
general 2021-07-16 07:01:25 yea but how do I do a mixture. because I can do both but not at the same time like some people's planes
general 2021-07-16 07:03:08 so is there a way to disable mouse controlled?
general 2021-07-16 07:03:37 okay thanks

general 2021-07-16 07:18:49 Why is no one answering me but commenting on my name
general 2021-07-16 07:19:27 yes I know about the countries but what rank do I need to make suggestions in <#507673335816126509>
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:28:03 They should make a radar block that picks up pilot/main pilot seats and radar resistant block that if surrounding main pilot/pilot seat on all side will block not show up on radar and if it isnt on all sides then will only show up if the side not covered is facing the radar
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:28:29 or a speed reading gun that shows other's speeds
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:32:44 why
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:33:51 It'll add some stealth aspects for pvp and make stealth planes have more function
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:34:28 give me the reason you don't think it should be added
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:36:31 It could be used on carriers to deploy like a safety mechanism like a net to stop them if they are too fast to stop and too slow to abort
general 2021-07-16 07:36:55 already said it in the dump
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:39:00 I take this as a challenge to make one that is big enough
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:40:01 I play in private servers mostly anyway
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:40:40 it just adds some more feature if you want realism
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:42:02 what difference is a rocket and missle? like missle controls with mouse?
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:42:53 rockets have homing option
the-dump 2021-07-16 07:43:30 fair enough
general 2021-07-16 15:41:17 Gun point
general 2021-07-16 15:42:11 slate and brown color will do just fine
general 2021-07-16 15:42:22 anyway not what I came to ask but whatever
general 2021-07-16 15:42:55 So I asked this last night but i dont think any one understood me
general 2021-07-16 15:44:05 So I know how to make custom control panels and use default control surfaces, but how do I make it as to where I can use both simultaneously on a single plane
general 2021-07-16 15:44:14 ohno
general 2021-07-16 15:44:38 I don't think you understand
general 2021-07-16 15:46:31 So I use custom control surfaces but how do I use both on a single plane where I can fly and move my mouse without it messing me up and fly with my curse
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 22:15:28 How wide are your planes from wingtip to wingtip? just a rough estimate
the-dump 2021-07-16 22:45:53 can we get a cone block
general 2021-10-15 01:05:38 Someone give me suggestions on what to build, I need to work on tanks mostly though
general 2021-10-15 02:17:03 Hey, any ideas on what to build
general 2021-10-15 02:17:18 burh
general 2021-10-15 02:20:30 does anyone else know what I should build
general 2021-10-15 02:20:55 ok

plane-crazy 2021-10-16 20:03:48 how do you guys get inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 20:04:10 and what should I build
general 2021-11-04 01:40:26 Can someone help, when ever I turn lock on my motor it wont move
general 2021-11-04 01:48:08 I meant with my keybinds

plane-crazy 2022-01-19 01:05:09 Bro I hate people who say EZ after they kill your tank with shredder bug like they have skill
plane-crazy 2022-01-19 01:15:22 Here is my MiG 23 intake so far, Im proud of this because it took like 5 motorlock for only the disconnecters
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:07:13 get rid of them but lower your tail lights a bit
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:07:19 they look too high up

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 20:04:25 F/A 18 just isnt as cool as tomcat tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 20:04:45 probably
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 20:04:55 definately
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 20:05:22 Sweep wings in general are hard, I tried making a flogger and it was hard
