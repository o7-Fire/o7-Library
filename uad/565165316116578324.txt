help 2021-09-24 23:08:06 imma try it again
help 2021-09-24 23:16:42 dude really
help 2021-09-24 23:17:11 how do i change some materials with not making it look weird
help 2021-09-24 23:19:44 ok but there are alot blocks that do not change texture
help 2021-09-24 23:19:57 like disconnectors (that i have alot across it)
help 2021-09-24 23:21:32 yeah but if i just add in some spots it might look a little weird
help 2021-09-24 23:23:17 added some more tones to it's belly, really not alot but i think it looks better
help 2021-09-24 23:23:35 it's more like a shadow than a paint by itself
