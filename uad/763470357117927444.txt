general 2021-08-11 00:47:32 Hi*
general 2021-08-11 00:48:43 My laptop is awesome at max graphics no lag
general 2021-08-11 00:49:06 yes
general 2021-08-11 00:50:12 hm
general 2021-08-11 00:50:56 Mine does
general 2021-08-11 00:51:46 Lol
general 2021-08-11 00:52:36 Is it just me or when I load something in and spawn it in like a second after it just turns blocks?
general 2021-08-11 00:53:18 No
general 2021-08-11 00:53:47 If I spawn it in too fast after loading it in it is just a few blocks not the entire build
general 2021-08-11 00:54:01 But when I despawn the entire build is there
general 2021-08-11 00:54:04 LEGO!

events-chat 2022-04-13 01:34:40 I donâ€™t bother to get roles sir
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:35:09 I only build things like ships anyways and they look decent
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:35:36 Armored patrol since none can decide
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:37:35 Iâ€™m currently making *The Mandalorian Juggernaut Rhydonium Transport truck*
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:38:43 I can run 30 at full graphics but occasionally lags because of insanely large builds
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:39:05 4k + probs lags me but idk for sure
events-chat 2022-04-13 01:39:51 People like armored

general 2022-08-17 04:05:27 Y'all think I should enter my 6k+ arleigh burke to get the master ship wright? I might be a bit laggy to drive it forward, backward, left, and right so it would probably be very slow
general 2022-08-17 04:07:38 Do any of you think I should do it?
general 2022-08-31 20:07:47 I really wish that the plots were longer so I can actually make my ship
general 2022-08-31 20:08:12 I fold but the gun barrel is too long
general 2022-08-31 20:09:10 ship gun barrel too long so i can't make gun ;-;
general 2022-08-31 20:09:19 lol
general 2022-08-31 20:09:30 wat
general 2022-08-31 20:10:14 im not pro builder like you guys so motor locking is kinda hard
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:17:54 gun barrel too long to fit on the plot ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:25:04 FIXED IT
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:25:13 i turn gun barrel
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:25:21 well
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:25:24 the entire gun
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:25:30 but it fine
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:26:17 Ello
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:27:46 idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:27:54 the top one is a quad barrel gun
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:45:31 Do any of you think the quad barrel gun in the back is too wide?
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 20:45:48 it used to be 17 blocks wide but it now 15
creations-chat 2022-08-31 20:57:35 YES I REALIZE THAT
creations-chat 2022-08-31 21:00:38 Sinking ehh I didn't put much to the hull so it's nearly non existant
creations-chat 2022-08-31 21:04:56 I can put a bunch of helium to make it not sink if you would like me to do it along with making it not as long
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 21:11:42 e
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 21:12:04 oof
plane-crazy 2022-08-31 21:12:21 where do you get the color role

general 2023-07-07 21:06:00 Hello
general 2023-07-07 21:08:36 where can I find the color roles
general 2023-07-18 18:19:10 is it just me or is the jetpack not working
general 2023-07-18 21:41:14 Bro i made 1 mistake building a plane that i've spent over 2 days and 11 hours building and I had to delete everything after it that connect to it
general 2023-07-18 21:41:28 so I got no back half and no wings anymore
general 2023-07-18 21:41:44 just the front half of a fuselage
general 2023-07-18 21:45:21 59 hours wasted just because of a minor error of making the plane fuselage 1, 1x4 block longer than it should've been
