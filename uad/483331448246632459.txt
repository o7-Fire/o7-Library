plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:14:52 ok..
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:21:07 wait a minute
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:21:11 how did i not know how springs work
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:21:13 i am so dum
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:21:21 i've been using 4 super rockets to power it
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:22:20 it's literally that simple
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:22:22 i just need springs
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:22:23 no ropes
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:22:27 they retract on their own
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:22:29 oh my GOD
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:23:01 dont need a stopper
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:23:04 dont need anything

general 2022-06-08 23:37:10 on a scale of 1-69420 how glitchy are half pistons
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:52:45 why dont the springs fully retract
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:53:22 oh wait a minute
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:53:50 they are fully retracting but the shuttle isn't already in the right spit
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 23:53:51 spot
creations-chat 2022-06-10 21:56:31 WTF
general 2022-06-10 21:56:40 quick question
general 2022-06-10 21:56:48 does auto retract make springs weaker
general 2022-06-10 21:57:30 i'm trying to make a spring powered catapult
general 2022-06-10 21:57:46 and i think when i turn on auto retract its slower
general 2022-06-10 21:57:58 you cant retract motor lock tho
