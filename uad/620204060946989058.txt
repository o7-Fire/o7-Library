plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:01:14 I had a control scheme like that on one my other planes, it can work
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:07:50 definitely
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:08:07 oh sweet decelerons
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:09:46 poggers
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:10:47 ah well, can't have everything off the bat
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:10:57 i'm sure you'll find a solution later on
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:11:57 it triggers my brain honestly, its just so annoying to see them
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:12:30 totally
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:15:39 honestly yeah I just outspeed them
bot-central 2021-04-27 07:19:08 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:25:36 goose go geese
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:27:22 Oh and btw, I know this might not be the right channel, but how do I counter the rolling tendency on single rotor helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:28:28 Yeah, that's what I'm currently using, and it works well
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:28:36 just curious if there are any other options
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:28:45 excluding a tail rotor
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:29:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:29:58 to roll me in the opposite direction
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:30:33 ye sounds good, thank you
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:38:56 made me remember all the combinations of control surface names
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:40:15 those are some kick ass brakes, nice work <@!461639155911229440>
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:42:06 wait rly
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:42:34 makes sense B)
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:43:37 bruh it's nearly 6 PM for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:44:12 what is that spine
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:44:48 Nah, I'm in the Micronesian islands
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:45:16 big succ intake
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:45:47 hydraulics go brr
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:47:35 honestly I kinda think exposed motor lock looks good, unless it's excessive
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:47:44 it adds t e x t u r e
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:48:16 alright yeah that's a lot of motor but I'm sure he can fix it anyway B)
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:48:21 agree
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:48:38 see Savage gets it
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:49:01 banana plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:49:40 when the plane has claws
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:51:32 that's how you know those brakes work B)))
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:53:40 yeah man gotta train that sneak skill
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:54:15 you gotta sleep my friend
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:54:35 bruh B(
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:56:21 yeah I guess ventilation wings are kinda iffy, but if it's a PVP build I wouldn't mind
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:57:17 gotta get them parmesan before I see those
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:57:38 i agree
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:57:47 my brain is suffering B(

general 2021-04-27 09:54:30 yeah it really looks like the tutorial version
general 2021-04-27 09:54:41 bruh moment
general 2021-04-27 09:55:32 Honestly I can't say the word "Inspiration" applies xd
general 2021-04-27 09:55:44 it's just so similar bro
general 2021-04-27 09:55:52 exactly
general 2021-04-27 09:56:04 from the wing roots to the canards
creations-chat 2021-04-27 10:51:52 feedback on this UH-1Y? or should I get a closer pic
creations-chat 2021-04-27 10:58:17 understandable, thank you for feedback, I'll get a closer pick in a second
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:01:27 Sorry, I'll try to post some other pictures, but slow mode has me crippled. I'll also post it unspawned if requested :D
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:07:19 Here is the front, the cockpit doors are open btw
creations-chat 2021-04-27 11:09:34 Thank you very much!
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 13:14:39 yo what
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 13:14:41 spam
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 13:14:58 he really do be grinding them image perms tho
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:18:09 I'd recommend using a motor to set the tail boom at a custom angle
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:22:31 The tail looks like this btw, so a locked motor to set it at an angle would help make it thinner as well
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:29:09 Looks like hell
creations-chat 2021-04-28 00:32:03 Yeah, you really gotta improve that canopy, make it taller and have a rounder front that isn't such a low angle
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:13:11 First of all, the canopy looks much better compared to the last version, so good work. Personally though, for highlighted area, I'd just replace that half wedge down with a corner wedge down, and then place a half triangle wedge on top of it, like this
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:16:16 Looks good, but I'd maybe shorten the canopy a bit, but aside from that it honestly looks good already. Oh, but don't forget to add a delta wing panel onto the sides, you can see AH-1Zs that they kinda have an angle on the side of the canopy
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:18:47 You're welcome friend
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:36:57 Oh, and <@!709209810310004837>, you can also try and make the gun directly in front of the motor if you want. Just attach some trails and stuff to make the guns not directly come into contact with the motor 2.
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:39:47 Perfect!
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:42:04 That isn't necessary, but yeah I think it looks a lot better ngl
creations-chat 2021-04-28 02:29:52 It would look good, so go for it!
creations-chat 2021-04-28 04:25:18 Yeah, I'm loving that camo and the thin intake!
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:02:55 Thoughts on this Little Bird?
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:14:36 Front
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:19:35 Thank you! It might be the fact that it's actually 2 blocks wide and not 3, so it seems really funky.
creations-chat 2021-05-03 08:23:10 Thank you again!
creations-chat 2021-05-03 12:23:53 <@!379257519593357313> very nice R3 !
creations-chat 2021-05-03 12:26:03 Yea, the color is nice, and the hover thruster headlights and windshield framing are great touches.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:20:41 Oh that looks cool
creations-chat 2021-07-06 13:48:42 Pretty sure it has black 1x4 delta wings on it, just very hard to see
creations-chat 2021-07-06 13:53:13 Pants milk<:Yikes:704804144657203220>
