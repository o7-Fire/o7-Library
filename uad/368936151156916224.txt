bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:18 So
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:20 I have a bug
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:24 I have a mini heli
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:35 And its perfectly symetrical
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:46 I have broken it down piece by piece to ensure so
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:43:50 Now,
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:21 As you would imagine, looking at the heli from the rear, you would see the CG horizontally centered. The problem is, its not.
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:24 no
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:30 I'm talking about inside the editor
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:33 The heli si fine
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:34 But
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:39 Actually,
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:46 It leans to the left because of this
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:45:50 *right
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:46:03 Is this a known bug?
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:46:47 The more pieces I remove from the heli, the more offset if becomes.
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:46:55 I had one piece in the middle
bug-reports 2019-07-03 21:47:04 Left over after removing alll of the pieces

bug-reports 2019-07-04 13:07:33 Look plz
bug-reports 2019-07-04 13:07:37 Its a big bug
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:36:10 Hello?
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:36:13 Anybody there?
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:36:44 So, I have a bug. I have a mini heli and its perfectly symmetrical.
I have broken it down piece by piece to ensure so.
Now, As you would imagine, looking at the heli from the rear, you would see the COG horizontally centered. The problem is, its not.
I'm talking about inside the editor.
But actually, It leans to the right because of this.
Is this a known bug?
The more pieces I remove from the heli, the more offset the COG becomes.
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:37:34 Look
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:38:07 Top view
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:38:52 Back view. Notice where the COM is? Keep in mind this heli is perfectly symmetrical.
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:39:20 When I remove all pieces except 1 or 2, look at the COM!!!
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:39:26 There are no pieces stuck under the mat
bug-reports 2019-07-04 15:39:36 I checked by lifting the heli up
