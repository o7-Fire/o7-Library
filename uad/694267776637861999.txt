plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:28:45 T-14 ARMATA (no tracks still wip)
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:29:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:29:12 
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:29:43 The barrel stuff is for pvp its kinda ruins it
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:30:33 based it off this model
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 02:30:42 with the anti air gun on it
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:01:16 When syrian T-72
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:03:53 It isnt its just the camera angle
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:07:18 One of my best lookin tanks
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:09:57 the top of the turret lacks detail tho imma work on that
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:25:08 I mean the materials like the rust and broken cages with the side skirts torn off are pretty good details like actual Syrian T-72
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:27:17 Why hide the top of the wheel? Also how tf am I gonna add tracks
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:29:21 Also the turret is about the same size. Also fake tracks pretty homo. I like suspension wheels to replicate tracks
creations-chat 2022-02-09 07:40:58 I tried fake tracks with wing panels with a tiger 1 I made a while a ago and it just slides around with no real suspension making it sway forward when stoping
creations-chat 2022-02-09 08:04:06 It actually plays this song https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QN3RaeBT1Wo
creations-chat 2022-07-01 21:40:03 its custom so alot of things are different to his T-80U
creations-chat 2022-07-01 21:42:55 kinda like the T-72M1mod that has extra slat armor/aps and composites

creations-chat 2023-06-11 00:14:57 oh its got a lift up face cuz on spring trap it has it too, usually for maintenance
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:21:55 It covers a lot
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:24:45 The league my group is in has specific rules and we are not allowed to have weapons inside tanks.
creations-chat 2023-06-12 20:45:17 Mainly for fun and keeping things fair
creations-chat 2023-06-27 22:30:37 Messed it up but everything was already in place and took forever to get the ship down there, remaking it for sure
