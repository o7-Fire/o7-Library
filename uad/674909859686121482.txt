general 2021-08-21 07:20:31 As a new person to the server is there a almost the deadline for playing crazy 2?
general 2021-08-21 07:22:09 Yea
general 2021-08-21 07:22:29 I’m guessing it will cost robux
general 2021-08-21 07:22:32 If so I’m down
general 2021-08-21 07:22:51 HUH
general 2021-08-21 07:23:00 it looks like it has RTX
general 2021-08-21 07:23:07 why would it not be robux
general 2021-08-21 07:23:26 True
general 2021-08-21 07:23:50 I guess it makes sense but still if it does I got 271 waiting with nothing to do
general 2021-08-21 07:24:27 I was looking at a video on how to make something and just seen (PLANE CRAZY 2!!$) so I looked and came here
general 2021-08-21 07:25:01 I will
general 2021-08-21 07:25:14 Great my nerves are shot now
general 2021-08-21 07:26:41 I think it will be a 2nd game I think people will still play the OG because they may not have a pc iPhone iPad laptop etc that’s good enough to run it
general 2021-08-21 07:27:04 But pc2 will most likely have a fast mode
general 2021-08-21 07:27:34 ( I wonder if crosswind or a breeze is going to be a new challenge for flying )
general 2021-08-21 07:28:25 2022 is only 133 days away
general 2021-08-21 07:28:43 This year went by fast
general 2021-08-21 07:29:37 My brain cannot handle any more change last time something change the pandemic started
