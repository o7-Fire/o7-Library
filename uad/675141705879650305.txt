general 2023-04-12 03:40:21 uh i wanted to help with development but obcpro99's dms aren't open so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2023-04-14 22:00:47 <@&706009538897117185> I was trying to DM obcpro99 and hyperbit that I would like to help work on Plane Crazy 2 but both of their DMs are closed. How can I get in touch?
general 2023-04-14 22:04:17 It just says that does the thing where I'm probably not in a server with them or they aren't friends with me
general 2023-04-14 22:05:21 "Your message could not be delivered. This is usually because you don't share a server with the recipient or the recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends."
