plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:12:03 I just attempted at making a helicopter but I need another level to post it lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:13:21 same
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:14:07 Should I make an UH-60 Black Hawk?
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:14:17 alright
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:14:26 I heard that they are pretty skinny
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:15:00 I think uh-60 would look cool
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:15:39 I'm not gonna make a replica but try to like base it off of a uh-60? idk

plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:20:57 just realized that the uh-60 is thicc, not skinny
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:21:26 I was thinking of an Apache <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:21:58 For some reason my fav thing to make is heli's
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:22:24 The only problem with mine is I can't make them hover
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:22:59 ah
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:23:08 I try to make my rotors realistic
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:24:23 mk
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:25:24 I'm deciding on making a UH-60 or Apache
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:26:32 prob UH-60
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:26:54 I'm finishing some other plane rn
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:27:48 I'm using a tutorial for it so I can get a feel on how to make them better
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:28:30 I learned how to make heli's from tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:28:57 same

general 2022-02-26 19:41:16 So how do you make the nose of a heli smooth and round?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:25:35 Starting to make an Apache attack Helicopter
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:27:39 it's a WIP the nose isn't done
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:29:42 I'm not keeping it like that, I'm just mapping it out
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:31:52 It's literally my second time making a heli
creations-chat 2022-02-26 20:35:36 I am starting over and watching a tut for motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 21:08:50 Should I make an Avro Arrow plane?
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 21:13:59 So how do I make this front "spike" part on a jet?
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 21:28:08 So how do I position the trail right?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 21:57:15 definitely still a WIP but like, front of jet
creations-chat 2022-02-26 21:59:46 Notice how I said WIP? I'm changing the cockpit later.
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:01:49 Well I don't really know how to design planes
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:10:59 is this a better nose or not?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:31:09 Ig it's coming along
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:35:01 You'll see
creations-chat 2022-02-26 22:37:10 Like this?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:23:10 cockpit prototype (ik it's bad)
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:29:34 This is the cockpit without it being motorlocked and piston locked
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 23:33:08 is this even good?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:09:13 Should I make this a Jet or sumthin else?
general 2022-02-27 00:41:25 <:pain:644301805534183464> üî´
creations-chat 2022-02-27 00:47:44 Progress on my fatass jet
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:18:47 Anything I can do to fix this atrocious cockpit?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:29:04 Well sorry for not having as much experience as other people üòê
creations-chat 2022-02-27 03:31:23 I'm really in here trying to get advice but everyone's just toxic, so im prob just gonna talk in other text channels
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:04:02 is this even a good nose and cockpit? Just say "yes" or "no" (jet)
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:26:24 I actually didn't use motorlock but ok
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:53:48 Not people replying to things that was posted like a millennium ago üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 22:50:57 Whats so bad about it? <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 22:52:37 Yeah but I just wanna know whats bad about it
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:19:12 I'm gonna make this but not post it cuz all I get is hate
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:41:04 Building an F-15EX
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:49:26 I told you guys it would happen
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:23:51 lmao I just learned how to do this
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:24:58 I cant figure out how to make it more round
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:26:17 You basically got flung really high
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:26:32 when you get high enough that happens
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:29:36 so how will I tie this nose into my jet...
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:30:24 I told you i just learned it, i know
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:30:41 yup
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:30:53 I never said I liked it either
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:32:29 tbh is there somethin I can do to make it more round
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:14:10 So like how do you make good exhausts?
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:17:51 I can see that üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:24:27 well should I make a Lockheed Martin F-22 raptor?

plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:32:39 Things happen that are unexplainable, kinda like when I saw my friend's d-
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:33:08 Sure...
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:33:55 yeah.. it was real cute <:4Weird:709084058721714324>

plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:37:35 tbh i forgor
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:39:19 alr so I should make this plane?
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:39:50 mk it's set in stone now
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:41:08 ok well give me a less common plane and i'll make it
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:41:40 I'm not that skilled but I try
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:43:16 Creeber (also not mine)
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:45:18 I don't wanna build this...
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:48:07 tie the seat into the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 22:49:32 I wanna know how to make the front spike thing have an actual indepth guide
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 17:43:22 I can't decide if this is ugly or not <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 18:08:20 you cant even see it if it's deformed through glass
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 22:33:52 I did a nose test
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:36:28 It's ugly but its one of my first motorlocked noses
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:39:42 This but a little bit better
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:50:31 Is this nose good or...
creations-chat 2022-03-07 00:51:35 Ik it's not good at all. but I'll add motorlocking later and make it better
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:23:03 I added a simple anglelock so the nose is slightly tilted down now
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:28:11 Cuz I wanted to
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:31:13 So like this? Also I want to have some advice on the cockpit.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:33:10 I'm not basing it off of a real plane, I'm just imagining it in my head.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:39:49 yea its pretty nice
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:43:26 I'll try it
creations-chat 2022-03-07 01:58:33 There, its much better now
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 02:21:43 are you able to add sideways motorlock towers to normal motorlock towers?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:25:12 Added that spike thing to the front
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:34:16 I'm gonna start the wings from here cuz I think it looks cool
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:43:52 This is how the wings are coming along, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:45:57 I wanted it long, I also wanted suggestions about the wings.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 02:48:02 No, I wanted suggestions on how to make the wings any better before I add more.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:12:11 I made it more like an f18s wing
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:16:20 I'm actually trying to make this jet look descent and you have to do this? I'm not an expert designer like you.
creations-chat 2022-03-07 03:27:24 So something like this?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:49:28 Starting to make an empire space shuttle (Kilo Ren's) I'm nowhere close to finished
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 17:08:56 Update on Kilo-Rens space shuttle
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 17:12:04 It's supposed to look fat, it's also a carrier
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 17:13:23 rockets
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:35:37 is this heli cockpit at least decent
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:22:41 This is the front of my jet so far (Not based on a irl jet)
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:33:28 I need a concept for and anglelocked wing on a propeller plane ( I'm extremely new)
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:34:27 Like where to put motors and wings on the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:35:36 I want the wing to be angled up and also custom wedges on both sides of the wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:36:25 That doesn't mean you can't help
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:40:06 See how to the ends are angled without any delta wings
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:41:01 only people who avoid showers say this shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:43:29 imo some exposed motorlocks just look better
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 21:44:35 thats what I mean
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:09:54 I finally got something
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:19:17 I said its something I know it's not good
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:38:05 an anglelocked wing
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:39:51 Atleast im not a furry
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:40:54 huh, so do I
plane-crazy 2023-04-10 22:41:50 What are you on about
general 2023-04-11 21:57:36 how the hell do you angle lock its so confusing
general 2023-04-11 22:01:22 how to anglelock <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2023-04-11 22:02:54 idk how to put all the motors inside a plane
general 2023-04-11 22:03:49 I know what a motorlock is silly
general 2023-04-12 22:03:13 I wanna make a cool jet but idk what to make and I can't think
plane-crazy 2023-04-12 22:16:11 I want a cool plane to build but idk what
plane-crazy 2023-04-13 00:00:06 lol funny cockpit and nose design
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 00:28:14 How to add jet exhausts
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:25:29 I'm pretty new so I want some opinions on this nose and canopy
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 01:28:22 What does that mean
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 21:08:19 Nose and canopy design ( loosely inspired by kamkam )
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 21:21:37 mid
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 21:22:07 its also a style
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 21:22:10 dumbass
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 23:37:42 Whats a plane I should build
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 23:39:08 its a little too big for my liking
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 23:40:56 Aight
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 00:20:24 simple stuka nose
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 00:43:27 yea im adding more long but I cant figure out why the motorlock isnt working
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 00:51:19 I added more long and more color now next is cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 01:37:27 finished cockpit (the exposed motor is here to stay)
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 01:55:38 is it the motor or plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 01:57:00 
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 01:57:51 what about it
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:00:05 Idk if it helps but B-2
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:01:19 Dude im not some nerd that wants to make a 1:1 replica, I'm making it my own
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:02:43 Yeah but I'm pretty new and I don't care about all that
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:04:13 I'm not expert designers so idk what you expect from me
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:06:55 I don't know how to anglelock
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:08:29 someone suggested it to me so I tried to make it, I don't know any planes.
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:10:08 Well at least I know that now, do you have a suggestion so I have something to gain
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:11:35 Thank you
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:13:30 what
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:17:34 It's only on a plane, it's not that bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:19:39 You showed me it before, why again?
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:22:29 Guess I'll go off this one then
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:23:23 
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 02:24:48 ok then, thanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 20:09:47 How would I overlay an image onto plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 20:13:14 Same to you
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 21:09:38 I want a plane to build that will look fine if you dont add the exhausts
general 2023-04-18 21:13:35 I want a plane to build that will look fine if you dont add the exhausts (no propeller)
general 2023-04-18 21:14:53 hell nah
plane-crazy 2023-04-18 22:24:04 Does anyone have a good color code for deep blue
