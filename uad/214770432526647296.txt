This is my carpet bomb drone.

~It flies well in the air

~Bombs spin in the rack, and when released they space out and form a diamond as they fall to the ground

~I can also just deploy them without spinning, or if I choose to, I can Just drop the entire thing without releasing the individual bombs.
