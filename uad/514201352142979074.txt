creations-chat 2021-05-27 00:22:25 make wings longer they are stubby, also put motors for motor flaps more forward, when you use them it will probably look weird

creations-chat 2021-05-27 00:56:39 it looks good but tryhards and motor lock losers are gonna throw a temper tantrum because it's to "simple"
creations-chat 2021-05-27 01:13:10 why is this server just among us
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:39:09 I don’t need to explain my reasoning, and I’d rather you not ping me.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:41:47 Do you know what “ironic” or “humor” means?
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:43:54 Oh no we don’t have ranks we’re completely unskilled, not surprising you don’t have much logic, not my fault you’re getting butthurt over a couple of downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 03:47:36 It’s my choice to give feedback if I want, if I don’t want to I don’t have to, nobody is putting a gun to my head, yes you did whine “I despise people who downvote and don’t give feedback”
general 2021-05-27 03:49:57 <@668314196764655618> you realize I’m not the only person arguing in creation feedback but you single me out?
general 2021-05-27 03:50:21 ok

creations-chat 2021-05-27 04:21:24 I don’t need to, now leave me alone
creations-chat 2021-05-27 04:25:35 stop pinging me, if you want to start an argument with me do it in general
general 2021-05-27 04:27:20 I already said multiple god damn times
general 2021-05-27 04:27:25 I’m not explaining myself
general 2021-05-27 04:27:32 Why are you so butt hurt?
general 2021-05-27 04:27:37 Oh no I got a downvote!

general 2021-05-27 04:31:13 Mass downvote? I downvoted the builds I didn’t like
general 2021-05-27 04:31:20 Just because I downvoted a lot

general 2021-05-27 04:36:35 and I’m the 12 year old alright
general 2021-05-27 04:38:26 you’re throwing a temper tantrum over being downvoted which is pretty immature, so I’m gonna make a assumption like you did and say you’re under 12
