creations-chat 2022-06-04 06:16:08 My builds never look good but they *usually* have functionality
creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:25:12 Just add wings to it and call it the gliding express <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-09-13 18:13:58 Gotta love it when people are trying to antagonize you and they fail to do it right <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2022-09-13 18:15:15 Pretty sure the only place you won’t get called out often is tanmk because everyone is too focused on killing one another lol
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:27:42 You could theoretically use stretched springs (for tension) because they have no collision and just make a compressed motor setup, sort of like a chain link if it had a pivot and one part could pass through the other
creations-chat 2022-10-20 13:29:58 I dunno if you care, but actual airplane windows are rounded to reduce stress on the windows (that would be hell to implement though)
creations-chat 2022-10-20 13:33:42 exactly why I said it would be hell to implement (f e e d b a c k)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:49:33 I’m not good at building in PC, (thus I don’t have a rank) but at least I can respect a good build (phantom)  also, why are there 3 downvotes now
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:52:15 fair enough (I’m shit at designing and building so anything that looks at least half decent is good in my books)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:54:25 I’m the guy who will put 2 swashplates on a parallel rotor setup and expect it to work (it does) <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-10-24 15:57:33 whenever I make stuff I just try to logically figure out how another person did it better ,then rebuild a shittier version from the ground up (with some bad locking because y e s)
creations-chat 2022-10-24 16:00:32 anything mechanical on a heavily motor locked build sounds like wizardry to me bc I barely know anything about *how* to do average locking
creations-chat 2022-10-24 16:03:00 ~~sabotage tactics~~ <:clueless:942802644043464734>    <@867429158330302514> why downvote
general 2022-11-09 23:25:21 tle
general 2022-11-10 15:02:44 38cm weapon?
general 2022-11-10 15:02:58 biggest available to the public is the 190mm
general 2022-11-16 06:45:55 2:30 untill launch
general 2022-11-16 06:46:12 yes
general 2022-11-16 06:46:35 yeah it’s at 2 mins for me
general 2022-11-16 06:47:19 1:05 for me
general 2022-11-16 06:47:35 buh
general 2022-11-16 06:47:41 I’m behind
general 2022-11-16 06:48:10 rocket momento
general 2022-11-16 06:48:19 oh wait we are behind by a bit
general 2022-11-16 06:49:19 they have unleashed the S U N
general 2022-11-16 06:52:29 they installed 1 too many conveyor drives
general 2022-11-16 06:54:24 basically “we have so much money look what we can do”
general 2022-11-16 06:54:50 6k mph
general 2022-11-16 06:55:01 almost Mach 10
general 2022-11-16 06:55:17 mach 8.5 ish i think
general 2022-11-16 06:56:17 i think shooting it with a gun might actually compromise it
general 2022-11-16 06:56:48 thin insulation and steel holding back liquid O2 (highly bobm)
creations-chat 2022-11-17 22:27:59 can’t you make the bomb arm on the drop key? (I could be an idiot and be missing something but i tried)
general 2022-11-23 15:24:49 that kinda ruins the whole point of sushi being seafood
general 2022-11-23 15:25:53 well I know kabunga coffee exists but thats it
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:06:04 I think it is (rocket banks that look like flywheels)
creations-chat 2022-12-01 14:33:38 meme build incarnate
creations-chat 2022-12-13 14:03:33 on the note of that, I wonder if it’s possible to make elliptical orbits (such as in the alpha centuri system) I mean you could probably do it with ropes but that would be boring to time
creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:59:31 you could maybe get it to work using a variable speed motor setup, if that’s even possible? or a weak strength spring as a slight attracting force (although I dunno how you can emulate the changing speeds of an elliptical orbit)
general 2022-12-14 22:53:04 I was gonna say that but just situationally I’m gonna get backlash lol
creations-chat 2023-01-11 22:32:17 i cant say that because barely (if anything) of mine is “better” (just a me-skill-issue-thing though)    <@1005644272541892609> the expectations in creations can fluctuate but they expect something to look at least half decent before they call it good
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:36:37 k
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:36:53 I would say people look for looks more than ability
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:37:09 since you can just motorlock a million motors into a really nice plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:37:20 and solve a bad-flight issue
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:37:53 I think it was the extreme use of motor lock, and the subsequent exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:38:17 also jets have a pretty high skill ceiling
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:39:18 maybe, but it’s also a good bit boxier than some other things
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:39:27 and there is really no smoothing
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:39:31 that might be it
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:40:03 to be fair you really shouldn’t take extreme criticism from me because I hardly have any idea what I am doing
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:40:29 I’m just trying to tell you some more glaring things so you get the rough idea down
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:40:47 once you can get it looking “decent” people will not care
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:40:59 or if it has a point
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:41:17 say like a working mechanical thingy
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:41:30 looks don’t matter because it looks complex
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:41:55 anyways I’m gonna leave you to take from that what you will
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:41:58 so
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:42:09 good luck with future projects
general 2023-01-18 22:54:00 cursed tanmk simulator is more fun because meme game and more shit teammates to yell at
creations-chat 2023-02-01 17:49:24 you could try fitting it directly up from where you are trying to make it now (so there is more horizontal space
creations-chat 2023-02-01 17:51:49 oh well, it was worth a shot
general 2023-02-14 18:08:38 you are sure to wake up
creations-chat 2023-03-29 21:38:10 I think you have to have a certain level with hyperbot (in other words, conversate with others or sorta just exist around the discord for a while)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 15:13:35 you were the one who was shitting on someone else’s build (from a reply chain)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 15:18:29 I think the worst part is that he is malding about being judged but then he judged others <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-06-11 21:06:16 it’s in the maldives
general 2023-06-11 21:06:18 somewhere
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:53:08 I probably can’t help this conversation in any meaningful way (as I’m a whitename) but it’s stupid to try to criticize people for a topic that you don’t have experience in (as you have no colored role)
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:55:09 I wasn’t siding with you, I was explaining how to an outsider your arguments make little to no sense
creations-chat 2023-06-20 22:57:12 ok he is making literally no sense now, so I’m gonna remove myself from this conversation before it gets out of hand
creations-chat 2023-06-20 23:03:52 it would be funny but people would come up with alternatives (like colorlessname) or use something like the cyrillic keyboard for replacing the e or the i or something
creations-chat 2023-06-20 23:05:56 you get the point though right
creations-chat 2023-06-25 23:32:38 the more armored a ship the more brick-y it is
general 2023-06-27 22:51:17 it’s always too hot (thankfully we didn’t lose power)
general 2023-06-27 22:51:31 except for the past 3 winters but that’s winter
creations-chat 2023-06-29 12:28:54 scratch is a block coder made for like first graders, that thing they made is just to let them control it manually
creations-chat 2023-07-12 21:33:32 I would do this but it just so happens to be 110f (43c) outside and I don’t feel like cooking alive
general 2023-07-13 04:41:27 half track small truck (enough said)
general 2023-07-13 04:42:06 halftrack I think would ruin its roadworthiness
general 2023-07-13 04:42:21 i think the engine wouldnt be able to keep up
general 2023-07-13 04:42:37 fake m16 mgmc
general 2023-07-13 04:43:52 toyota van with a open sunroof and a 20mm autocannon sticking out the top <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2023-07-13 04:44:00 quintuple he means
general 2023-07-13 04:44:21 it’s quintuple
general 2023-07-13 04:44:45 then sextuple and septuple then octuple then nonuple then decuple
general 2023-07-13 04:44:50 I forgot 11
general 2023-07-13 04:45:22 is it undecuple?
general 2023-07-13 04:45:40 and is 12 duodecuple
general 2023-07-13 04:45:43 and so on?
general 2023-07-13 04:45:46 I forgot
general 2023-07-13 04:46:02 every roblox community shares like 3 combined braincells
general 2023-07-13 04:46:06 maybe 4 if they are lucky
general 2023-07-13 04:47:10 none because I don’t eat burgers regularly
general 2023-07-13 04:47:40 is this a daily occurance here
general 2023-07-13 04:48:50 I could maybe like fit 2 of the baconator burgers in my mouth but even my fatass self probably couldn’t stomach both lmao
general 2023-07-13 04:49:01 and they don’t sound extremely appealing
general 2023-07-13 04:49:11 maybe not 2
general 2023-07-13 04:49:12 but like
general 2023-07-13 04:49:22 I can 100% stick a potato in my mouth
general 2023-07-13 04:49:55 im the kind of guy who will eat a 10oz steak in like 4 bites
general 2023-07-13 04:49:58 somehow
general 2023-07-13 04:50:27 give me a relative size
general 2023-07-13 04:50:33 I may have overstated
general 2023-07-13 04:50:57 monitor size matters here
general 2023-07-13 04:51:13 if it’s th e size on my phone it’s like a quarter the size of my fist
general 2023-07-13 04:51:18 so like
general 2023-07-13 04:51:53 so like 1.25x fist size
general 2023-07-13 04:52:13 so like as large as like 1.25x someone’s fist
general 2023-07-13 04:52:14 right
general 2023-07-13 04:52:40 mcdonalds only has good breakfast (except in Europe, it’s good there)
general 2023-07-13 04:53:23 I can fit like everything up to the actual finger joints into my mouth for four of them lmao
general 2023-07-13 04:53:38 everything but the thumb because it’s too far back but
general 2023-07-13 04:53:41 oh well
general 2023-07-13 04:55:02 i love being the third tallest in my family at 15
general 2023-07-13 04:55:06 it’s very funny
general 2023-07-13 04:55:25 5’11 or so
general 2023-07-13 04:55:45 uncle and dad are both like 6’1 and 6’3 respectively
general 2023-07-13 04:56:36 my physician thought I was gonna be 5’10 at 20 or something
general 2023-07-13 04:56:40 guess not
general 2023-07-13 04:57:26 i was taller than like all of the students in my freshman year
general 2023-07-13 04:57:57 I was really short untill the pandemic then over the lockdown I grew like 6 inches for no fucking reason lmao
general 2023-07-13 04:58:55 I actually have scars on my inner arm from where I grew too fast <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2023-07-13 04:59:37 i don’t think that’s a major factor
general 2023-07-13 05:00:24 I’m still growing fairly quickly, but for how long I don’t know
general 2023-07-13 05:00:53 probably a bit overweight because southern united states but oh well
general 2023-07-13 05:01:02 meat is half our diet
general 2023-07-13 05:01:06 not super healthy
general 2023-07-13 05:01:29 yesterday was tacos today is chicken tomorrow might be sushi grade salmon
general 2023-07-13 05:01:35 at least the salmon is healthy
general 2023-07-13 05:01:48 read
general 2023-07-13 05:01:54 look at the same tree
general 2023-07-13 05:02:02 for a grand total of 3 seconds
general 2023-07-13 05:02:04 before you pass it
general 2023-07-13 05:02:32 I don’t think I’ve ever slept ina car in the past 2 years
general 2023-07-13 05:03:09 I’ve slept on an overseas flight to Europe once but it was overnight so
general 2023-07-13 05:03:35 of course it was my *only* flight to Europe so
general 2023-07-13 05:04:36 only reason I know I’m still gonna grow is because my legs are longer than my dads, but he is still taller because his torso is taller (so I will probably grow there)
general 2023-07-13 05:05:21 still got longass legs for my age
general 2023-07-13 05:05:36 yes
general 2023-07-13 05:05:43 scieince
general 2023-07-13 05:05:52 and speling
general 2023-07-13 05:05:57 totally useful
general 2023-07-13 05:06:11 I had to manually spell those wrong
general 2023-07-13 05:06:18 because of autocorrect
general 2023-07-13 05:07:14 ooh boy I can’t wait to be up at midday tomorrow and it be 110f (43c)
general 2023-07-13 05:07:19 and humid
general 2023-07-13 05:07:30 so fun
general 2023-07-13 05:07:59 last time it rained was a week ago. before that it hadn’t rained for FIVE WEEKS
general 2023-07-13 05:08:08 it has not dropped below 70 this entire summer
general 2023-07-13 05:08:21 highs for the heat index nearing 120
general 2023-07-13 05:09:06 ok, so like midday the heat index is like 48
general 2023-07-13 05:09:09 is that better
general 2023-07-13 05:09:28 in any case if you are out there for too long it’s suicidal
general 2023-07-13 05:09:36 it froze last winter
general 2023-07-13 05:09:48 like -13c
general 2023-07-13 05:10:00 we had a tree fall over onto the road
general 2023-07-13 05:10:02 like
general 2023-07-13 05:10:09 a 60 year old oak
general 2023-07-13 05:10:17 got pulled out of the fucking ground
general 2023-07-13 05:10:31 we lost 3 trees
general 2023-07-13 05:10:42 a full grown 100 year old cedar snapped like a twig
general 2023-07-13 05:10:52 it was like a foot in diameter
general 2023-07-13 05:11:43 hopefully this winter isn’t as bad as the previous few, but if trends are to be believed it’s gonna be worse than all 3 prior
general 2023-07-13 05:12:43 I had a tornado pass like half a mile from my house, a 2x4 got embedded in my friend’s window
general 2023-07-13 05:12:51 scared the shit outta her
general 2023-07-13 05:13:38 I would send images but I’m too lazy to get roles lmao
general 2023-07-13 05:13:44 so no
general 2023-07-13 05:15:02 the tree that fell over onto the street in our neighborhood shook the floor of my house
general 2023-07-13 05:15:05 it was scary
general 2023-07-13 05:17:52 in Texas you can get tornadoes, hurricanes, freezes, 120f highs, and temperate weathers in a span of 3 months
general 2023-07-13 05:17:56 it’s honestly crazy
general 2023-07-13 05:18:53 110 degrees (43c) of temperature flux for a temperate zone is a lot
general 2023-07-13 05:19:57 Celsius?
general 2023-07-13 05:20:34 so whatever 60x 1.8 is your temperature flux
general 2023-07-13 05:20:43 isn’t that like 108
general 2023-07-13 05:20:47 108f
general 2023-07-13 05:21:24 trol
general 2023-07-13 05:21:56 95 is normal in summer
general 2023-07-13 05:22:03 that’s like midnight
general 2023-07-13 05:22:07 well fair
general 2023-07-13 05:22:22 but -13 isn’t that much less than 8
general 2023-07-13 05:22:52 metric is better in most cases imo but I learned imperial so I’m trying to convert on the fly (((it’s not going well)))
general 2023-07-13 05:23:07 trolled
general 2023-07-13 05:23:12 ping no worky
general 2023-07-13 05:24:21 it seems that Texas temperature is just canada temperature plus 20f (11c or so)
general 2023-07-13 05:25:05 ok I sleep now (it’s 12:30pm
general 2023-07-13 05:25:09 honk shoo
