creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:08:53 
creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:08:54 vs shaded bow
creations-chat 2020-07-01 16:13:23 Why
creations-chat 2020-07-02 05:03:46 <@!417484722239963136> does that bruhpache have a working swashplate
general 2020-07-02 05:07:13 ive never lost a save before I don't understand
general 2020-07-02 05:07:18 is this something I should be scared of
general 2020-07-02 05:07:22 anything I can do to prevent
general 2020-07-02 05:10:50 LCAC
general 2020-07-02 05:10:55 with tonks inside
general 2020-07-02 05:11:06 idk i heard the hover engines dont scale well though
general 2020-07-02 05:11:09 might be worth a try still
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:23 <@356231361344045057> did u end up finishing ur yamato in the build space
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:33 Didnt look like itd fit to me
creations-chat 2020-07-02 14:47:42 I will be pleasantly surprised if u did
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:18 dang teach me your ways
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:20 ropes??
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:26 i mean i made one that works like a real swashplate
creations-chat 2020-07-02 15:59:35 im not big brain enough to figure out a plane crazy specialized one
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:00 also wouldn't be surprised if it's been done before, but has anyone seen a falcon 9 with lockmotor grid fins
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:41 wait but
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:00:44 how do the ropes actuate the blades
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:18 moves swashplate as in spins it?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:25 wait the ropes get twisted?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:40 anyone have like a reference/screenshot that I can investigate/copy idk
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:53 center of mass is back
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:01:57 and having wings in the back causes drag
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:06 so it'll tilt back when upward force is applied
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:23 orly
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:36 i heard smth about heli blades being proportional to the heli's mass or size or something
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:02:47 idk why though
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:06:05 ^^ I'm struggling with that too, the tail rotor causes heli to drift in one direction
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:06:12 also how does one bruhplate
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:08:09 <@!417484722239963136> any chance u can leek bruhpache swooshplate design? if it's ur own then nvm but if it's a common thing I'd like to see
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:09:03 i've never seen it in person or anywhere else
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:09:12 besides like sakura screenshots
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:09:20 sweet
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:35 heck
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:39 no helium no stahp
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:44 helium bad, heavy ballast bad
creations-chat 2020-07-02 16:10:50 just spam pontoons/lightest ballast at the waterline, on the hull sides
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:37:37 my god
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:37:48 that's excessively excessive yet super amazing
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:38:07 lots of lock motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:38:10 ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 16:38:39 dang yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:36:24 ? what
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:36:28 oh earlier lol

creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:44:32 hate when they put guides on the sidess of the tracks
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:45:15 yamato turrets, old(right) vs new(left)
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:46:01 lockmotors are magical
creations-chat 2020-07-02 18:46:04 looks so much better
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:40:56 anyone have a better way to make ship railings
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:40:58 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:41:04 lockmotoring ladders down is SO annoying for curved parts
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:42:57 yeah but then it just doesn't go in...
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:42:59 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:43:15 guess i could use disconnectors? let the railing sink down 1 after turning the railings
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:43:29 the motor2 is locked into the hull,, but struggles to move the railing in
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:00 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:13 im trying to turn the railing in
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:21 but since i sink it half a block, it collides with the hull and glitches out
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:44:33 I think i have to turn it in, THEN lock it down?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:46:52 hhh bruh
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:47:02 that could look okay but.. might miss vertical poles
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:47:58 oh wait looks promising
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:48:03 ww1 boats ugly smh
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:48:46 i dont like the chonky straight hulls

creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:49:32 lockmotor?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:06 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:09 wait that's pretty good lmao
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:14 i welded it with maget
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:27 oh that landing pad is so sick
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:50:50 also is there a reason why everyone seems to like half wedges and such for hulls, instead of triangle wedges?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:33 cus like
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:41 half wedges look kinda rough
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:50 but triangle wedges r so smooth and nice
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:51:52 
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:52:03 if anyone has a smooth lookin half wedge hull
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:52:04 pls send pic
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:01 I just make parametric curves in solidworks or autodesk inventor, sample slopes at various points, and do the math
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:18 then u know what mix of straight blocks and 1x4's to use
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:31 cus like if uw ant a slope of 1/9 its a 1x4 with 5 striaght blocks around it right
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:53:39 how else do ppl do hulls
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:54:00 fair point
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:54:09 im more of an artist than engineer so...
creations-chat 2020-07-02 21:54:15 fair bit of compensation with my paintjob though

creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:14:03 also what's the benefit of this hull technique? I see it so often but never figured out why
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:15:46 it's harder to build, looks worse(imo), more blocks...
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:15:51 does it float better or something?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:01 not roasting the build, just curious why EVERY other nice ship I've seen does this
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:33 why not use wedges to round out the edges of that
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:16:41 yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-02 22:17:08 its really nice, u use a reference?

creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:43:40 I thought of making a nebulon, realized it could look awesome cus it's spindly and can fold pretty hard
creations-chat 2020-07-03 03:45:03 then I made a 5-plot-wide snoke ship thing instead
creations-chat 2020-07-03 15:12:25

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:36:38 u sure its not the angle
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:36:45 i think its both
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:36:59 the angle and being in shadow in the first pic prolly
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:44:25 daaang i could only ever get one module t o work
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:44:36 it can turn right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:44:44 ah dang
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:44:48 cant u reverse the direction of one module
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:44:59 i made 4 foot so it couldnt turn
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:45:03 mirroring it would've made it turnable
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:45:07 are all those 8 legs connected?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 16:52:03 wait <@!208322565171576833> then you should be able to turn by reversing half the modules??
the-dump 2020-07-05 17:06:10 140 110 90
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:16:35 please tell me it involves rails with gentler curves
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:16:43 or hopefully even narrower gauge rails
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 19:17:15 ah you think he just lazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:32:43 the contest map even still has work imo
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:32:49 heavily favors certain builds which isn't a good thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:33:11 should have more water for large ships, at least one second airport on an island
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:34:14 if it really takes a year
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:34:16 i'd disagree
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:34:30 anything that would prevent new content for more than 3 consec. months I would be very wary about doing
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:36:42 i got a train car that automatically banks corners
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 20:36:50 but idk how to make bogeys so it occasionally derails
creations-chat 2020-07-06 00:30:55 <@456226577798135808> did you see that one roblox game about how the engine messes up when your coordinates become extreme
creations-chat 2020-07-06 00:31:11 that was the second game in which I saw that phenomenon

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 22:40:36 <@!347182144873037824> https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/736456749871136809 the track is built diagonally so the motors dont connect, and are connected to each other via signs and the tread
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 22:40:46 thee wheels dont collide with motor heads, but the outside rim of the tread
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 22:41:01 so its both 1 block wide, and the treads aren't thick
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 22:41:14 handling is trash tbh, my 2-wide version is a lot nicer, but ig it has uses for halftracks and such
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 00:18:34 <@!347182144873037824> how do the tracks stay connected to each other, or stay on the guide wheels?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 15:23:06 <@!347182144873037824> wing trails connect each unit to the last via the tread
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:40:47 <@!437078588701933568> i dont like using half blocks, 1x4 wedges and normal blocks are superior
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:41:17 I took beam measurements at diff parts along the hull from a blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:41:35 all the green markings/numbers are my reference markings
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:42:02 so i could tell like, 50 blocks down the hull it should be 20 wide, at the fold it should be 24 wide, etc etc
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:42:17 so then i just smoothly connected the dots
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:42:28 i do the deck first, then the side profile, then use a 3D model to flesh in the rest
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:43:02 
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:43:05 to achieve the smooth boi hull
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:43:43 wdym?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:06 like straight top down
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:08 or angled a bit higher
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:27 i literally copied the blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:30 i assure you it's good
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:36 nah ur tripping
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:44:47 u see the  blueprint?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:45:06 
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:45:08 here is a higher angle at least
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:45:11 booting game to do full top
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:45:29 thank
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:45:35 yeah im opening game my guy

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:46:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:46:22 i just dont have the patience to edit it anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:46:44 i think my point about 1x4 wedge hulls still stands
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:47:13 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:47:18 cus at the bow i didn't wanna use half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:47:26 and the location of the fold got tricky
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:47:29 meh
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:47:29 i could easily thinnen it but
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:48:16 naaaaaaaaaaaa

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:50:09 heck
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:50:15 i made this before i knew what motor 2 did
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 19:50:22 dont think it's worth going back with lock motor

creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:08 <@!587047177558163466> I wanted something of size usable for like a rock crawler build. That mecanum chassis actually works ok on hills, strafes straight, but is kinda bumpy on road even with suspension. Getting a remotely circular overall profile was tough... 8 rollers is probably doable with 2x2 2s, but really hard to get on my scale
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:45 
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:07:48 8 roller thats really small
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:08:04 HELLA smooth moving and strafing, but since the roller axis isn't aligned properly, the thing slips in all directions which sucks
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:08:08 also wheels mega wide

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:42:52 i just rarely see good looking tanks with actual cannons
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:43:10 of a reasonable size
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:43:13 even in vip
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:43:24 valid
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:47:46 dont judge
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:48:03 i mean herr doesnt my design look ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:48:12 p sure uve also seen me in game
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:48:42 
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:48:47 could def make an ok looking KV2 or something
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:48:59 tried to get it flat enough for modern tanks though
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:49:06 barrel still to chonk
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:37:12 what have i done
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:37:14 
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:37:24 rapidfire, motor2 aimed, elevating and rotating ball cannon
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:37:25 kv2 turret
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:37:35 no motoloc
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:45:25 i want the tank to be not too big
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:45:32 so ididnt scale it to barrel
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:50:11 it's the size i want it to be
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:50:21 and i dont wanna lockmotor a lid on
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:50:29 might build body later

plane-crazy 2020-08-21 00:31:44 here I am with 3 days
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:55:36 are hover engines known to be bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:55:46 my 190 block hovertrain drops me from 62 to 15 fps when cornering
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:57:47 yeah its so sad
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:57:58 my bare hovertrain chassis is pulling corners at 650 speed without derailing
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:58:17 but once i added seats and windows, my fps drops by 75%
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 02:58:27 im sad
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:04:35 as in for submarines?
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:22:40 isn't there a confirmation
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:22:45 for when u load
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:23:47 i have no clue
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:23:55 and i hate subs in pc cus htey're flooded inside
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:24:01 also wait the hovers weren't the real problem
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 03:24:07 it was cus i was mounting them on motor2 🙂
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 04:12:32 who said anything about hover propulsion
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 04:14:50 
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 04:14:52 hover stabilization is the hot stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 05:38:03 <@!163143541160148992> yamato toorets visible
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 05:38:44 yeah its hard to see but like
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 05:38:48 at least u know it looks good from a distance
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:04:35 I kinda wanna try a nice katyusha now
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:04:43 Would impact missiles work
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:05:10 Mouse guided would be tough to get it compact
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:06:41 1x1 guided missile is possible but tough
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:06:53 Ud have to lock together a vertical and horizontal wing
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:01 On a 1x1 gimball
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:16 Which would be like 4 block long, sad
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:39 But if u do 2 explosive blocks and 2 wings in front, 7 long missile might be acceptavle
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:41 13 is lonk
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:47 How much charge?
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:07:55 7 sounds possible
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:09 I mean technically itll be more than 1 from motorlock heads
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:22 But if udont count the noncolliding motor bits
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:24 Then u can do 1x1
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:28 Show us urs
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:32 How good is the guidance
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:42 Oh sick
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:46 1x1 mouse guided?
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:08:58 Heck thats clever
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:03 DISGUSTING
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:12 Im trying to fire several
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:16 I need mouse fire n forget
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:18 It is
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:27 I wanna see spinning design
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:40 But im just thinking 2 motor2s in front of each other
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:42 E
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:42 Just
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:45 Ez
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:09:54 Ah yeah thats faid
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:02 But 1x2 build is qcfeptable
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:05 For my purpose
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:10 Thrust turn is tough
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:17 Thats acceptavle
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:20 I want a katyusha
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:24 Can we seeed
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:27 The beees
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:33 Does it spin a motor2 thruster
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:10:44 K ping me later
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:06 Sick
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:11 Alright then
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:18 Btw do ya build robots irl
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:27 Eyyy
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:34 My pfp is from FTC competition
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:45 Competition or just hobby
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:11:56 Oh shoot holy
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:12:18 Jeez vombat
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:12:20 I do like
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:12:26 Nornal civilian robotics
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:19:22 Thats hiladious if they rlly are stable
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:21:49 Dont have many good pics rn of my robots
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:22:19 Dumped like $1k into this thing but at least I didnt pay for it
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:22:24 Hover drag is clever but
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:22:30 Dont the hovers have to be in feont
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:22:47 The hover engine provides force
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:23:06 Oh true
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:23:21 Thrust in the front then?
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:48:17 
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:48:23 lasor sight actually from tie fighter
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:48:37 all half block hulls look like tilled dirt smh
plane-crazy 2020-08-23 03:48:44 1x4 wedge is king
