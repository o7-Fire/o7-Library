plane-crazy 2021-10-12 16:22:30 Finally catgirl kv2
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 16:32:13 Is it socially acceptable to add cat ears to a merkava 4
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 16:34:11 Aw damn
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 16:34:40 Tail?
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 16:35:11 *sadness*
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:26:00 Wedge locks
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:26:04 *blocks
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:29:22 This is the sad truth, time =/= good
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:31:59 I would add more texture and details with materials tool, I dont think scrapper is that clean in the actual movie
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:37:28 The thing is a lot of newer players spend hours and days on 1 rlly bad build since they lack experience and don’t know how to repurpose blocks and add detail then complain that their build gets torn apart in <#384025409945337856> even tho they spent a ton of time and put in effort. Then you have players who have a few hundred hours in the game who spend like half an hour putting together a plane with huge amounts of detail and historical accuracy (assuming it’s a replica not an original design) with their knowledge of the game and how to use blocks to their full potential get tons of likes.

TL:DR
Effort + time =/= good
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:37:48 There
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:38:33 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:38:41 I’m not a mod lol, I have no ranks
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:38:50 I just chat here
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:40:36 Effort and time **can** result in a better build and **usually** will but it doesn’t guarantee that your build is good, I’m just saying you can’t spend 7 hours putting together a giant cargo plane missing slopes, not using curves, and the end result looking like something out of 2019 babft and expect ppl to love it

<@!401530469952389130> what
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:42:38 ^^^

Also size =/= good
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:45:55 All of these things **can** contribute to a better build if used properly, there’s no direct correlation with any building technique and “good”. Also <#384021699466756107> pls, the cooldown on this is killing me
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:46:58 Yea that’s what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:47:47 Having a huge c17 with motor locked stuff doesn’t mean it’s better than a tiny, properly put together car with 0 motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:48:30 Typically yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:49:39 <@!402265111189782540> yea, having a ton of complicated and useful but poorly executed building techniques doesnt add up to much
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:50:03 The most obvious example of effort =/= good is shredders
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:51:29 Some dude who googled “hwo build plen crazy shred bug” and spent about 5 mins building one isnt gonna need many braincells to slap ur f35 what you spent a full week of your life working on out of the sky
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:54:30 Detail ~ good

Poorly executed detail (detail in all the wrong places) can look like shit cuz it draws the eye to the unimportant parts of your plane

Also in pvp functionality>everything else, being able to hit hard while being hard to hit/dumb amount of tnt armor>4k blocks of detail and a 5 story motor lock tower
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:58:34 Blacklist + rocket accelerator turret (cant find video but just makes rockets spin stupidly fast around a central shaft and they go far and fast)
creations-chat 2021-10-12 19:05:08 I think it is pilot size, its just a lot closer to the camera than the ring plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:05:23 Dunno where teh vid went
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:05:28 But
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:05:35 If you have a shredder in your server
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:05:55 All credit to original creator
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:06:11 (Dont use motor 2 since they arent strong enough and wobble)
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:12:15 **Blue**=weapons (make sure all the rockets are behind orange motor)
**Red**=super rockets (spin power)
**Orange**=unpowered motor (not locked, acts as a loose shaft for the rockets to spin)
**Purple** = w s motor for vertical movement
**Green** = a d motor for horizontal movement
**Black** = blocks (i used tnt since it cant be destroyed by guns and rockets, doesnt rlly matter since the gun wont be traveling and if you get hit around the orange motor ur screwed anyways)
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:12:40 Great anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:12:45 Turn on blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:12:48 And add an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:13:06 Shredders dont deserve a fair fight
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:14:42 If u use a plane ur simply encouraging them to keep using their shredder
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:14:54 If they can’t kill you they quit
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 19:46:48 I posted it here since idk where the yt vid went

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:32:31 k
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:32:32 ty
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:32:40 so does weight affect it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:33:31 could i just slap a ton of helium on the turret
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:38:46 https://youtu.be/-2hjn4cE358
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:39:00 This dude used motor 2 and it seems to work fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:39:15 My turrets is a similar size
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:39:51 No
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:40:00 I’m looking through other turrets to see what they use
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:41:53 Y e s
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:43:47 I think I have
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:43:53 7
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:44:19 Should I shorten it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:44:45 Ah yea I cut off all the barrels
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:44:50 It seems to work fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:46:26 Is there any way to trick the motors?
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:46:46 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:46:55 
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:46:58 these work fien
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:47:04 so im not sure if length is the issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:48:32 Momentum
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:48:33 Ig
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:49:30 Perhaps the base is too heavy
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:50:01 My reasoning is
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:50:14 Holding a baseball bat
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:50:20 At the handle
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:50:36 Makes it swing “slower” but harder
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:50:51 Holding it at the top makes it “faster” but lighter
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 23:51:09 Maybe the weight needs to be near the ends instead of being on top of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 00:45:10 DAMN
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 00:49:36 Lma

plane-crazy 2021-10-28 16:07:47 Not valid
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 16:08:12 Well technically you can just walk around then
creations-chat 2021-10-28 16:58:20 The wings look a bit off, I think the angle could be steeper
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 16:03:25 Thinking the flag is a sign of evil is pretty dumb/immature, no point denying history
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 16:03:35 Just dont promote the actions of that group
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 16:10:09 yep

creations-chat 2021-11-05 01:01:25 Great but where’s the radar disc of the e-3 sentry? Automatically makes a plane 10x better, there’s always room for a massive radar disc
creations-chat 2021-11-05 01:03:56 I fear for the health of the pilot sitting directly in front of the laser, u sure it won’t lead to long term health concerns? Add vtol thrust to the disc <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 01:06:48 You can use half blocks or text instead of trails, trails and exposed motor lock r just ugly imo
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 01:07:12 Unless u incorporate them correctly into ur build
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 01:07:21 It just look like ur bike has a tumor tho

Also <#384021699466756107>? Cooldown is pp
the-dump 2021-11-05 12:23:37 Anyone mind giving me a hex code for an industrial yellow?
the-dump 2021-11-05 12:23:49 Like the color on construction stuff
the-dump 2021-11-05 12:24:11 I’m tryna find 1 but they all look more like piss yellow
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 12:35:36 Get both to hof lol
creations-chat 2021-11-05 12:39:06 Feedback(I’ll get some pics on computer later) I’m switching the color pallet since green and grey is boring, that’s why there’s a bit of yellow in the back. The entire build is me having fun with the skis since I never use them, I’m gonna add more detail to the armor and fix the main gun, the reason why big gun is so thicc is bcuz there’s 8 guns in there, I’ll motor lock them into a more skinny gun later. I made this purely focusing on performance in pvp which is why all detail went to hell.

**features** 
1 forward lava spitter (in the hull)
1 spinning lava spitter (force field lol)
10 guns in 2 separate turrets
12 rockets, 8 on a main turret and 4 spread across 2 gun turrets
2 spinning cutter wheels (anti shredder bug)
More cutters along the entire front section bcuz yes
Entire front section has tnt armor (covered up bcuz tnt ugly) 
Back section can be disconnected if the turrets are knocked (no point carrying extra weight)
No wheels so there’s no weak point to target
Only way to kill it is to kill the chair or shred it
the-dump 2021-11-05 12:49:18 Didn’t realize this was in <#495286269459300364>
the-dump 2021-11-05 12:49:19 Oops

creations-chat 2021-11-05 15:07:27 Feel free to uninstall, dont give the braindead 9 year olds a new toy, first the original shredder,  then the shredder ball, then shredder swarms. Some people dont deserve the right to play this game, all ur gonna accomplish with a tutorial is making the pvp gamemode even more unplayable, i hope you get bullied for using that if you make a tut
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 15:11:45 The new shredder swarm can burn in the deep pits of hell
creations-chat 2021-11-05 15:30:12 What

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:52:44 Since
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:52:52 The propeller rotates the entire rear of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:53:09 But i cant connect the rear of the plane to the front in build mode because it screws with the motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:53:26 Magnets wouldnt work would they
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:53:44 I did
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:53:50 There’s 6 motors total
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:53:55 2 motorlocking on each side
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:54:07 1 to spin the prop
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 16:54:20 1 unpowered being used as a loose axel

creations-chat 2021-11-08 18:10:50 I would use somethign else to represent the wingtip missiles, the half wedges look a bit unrealistic

If possible hide the landing gear

Add more color variety since pure grey looks drab

Overall a good plane, nice to see an f16 that obviously doesnt follow that 1 tutorial that everyone does
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 18:11:53 Finally
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 18:12:32 Back to the anime pfp

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 18:13:42 I dont have to get yelled at by a 7 year old who probably uses shredders and shames you for getting shredded in your jet that you spent more than 5 minutes working on

Actual feedback tho

Nose could be improved with a bit of locking

The slope of the back is a bit steep, the back of the mirage barely slope at all (think f4 phantom)

The roof of the Jesko is a lot less pointy irl

Not sure how to say it properly but the back part of the cabin….? starts sloping in a lot earlier and the curve is less steep (yellow is excess/just follow the back line)

I’m giving detailed feedback for this since its a nice dino, you just need to add some detailing and improve the marketing/stop begging for hof

1st of all, shit camera angle, keep in mind this isnt roblox anymore, we cant look around and get different angles, thats up to you to capture the best angles and show those angles to us. Can we maybe get a front view, top down, or build mode? (Take some hints from current hof builds)

2nd, give a more detailed explanation of your build, not just begging for hall of fame (look at some in hof rn, the latest mech is a pretty good example)

3rd, adding a diorama (background) is a nice way of making ur build look nicer (examples below)
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/909389679579766855

4th, begging for hof makes you seem like a baby, a build worthy for hof doesnt require any begging/pleading, it will naturally get its upvotes and work its way into hof

5th, add textures, dinosaurs typically don’t look like plastic, making it all the default texture makes it look fake (take hints from the stone turtle and the crab in <#627195143040139264>)
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 20:14:56 A
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 20:55:57 Water propellers, delta wings, trail, half ball, then an excessive amount of disconnectors or wing panels?

Only feedback is that it could use some detail (probably hard to find detailed pictures of an obscure tank), it just looks a bit “plasticy” and cartoonish
I would try to fix it by adding details found on tanks of that era, no one said it has to be perfect to reality since that tank was mainly just a concept, have creative freedom and keep it up 👍
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 02:21:49 He’s crying in <#504436696021204992> rn about ppl downvoting it

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 02:25:46 1st, cheese grater wings need to go, use motor flaps ffs

2 add size variation to the body (don’t make it a fucking pencil)

creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:35:24 Don’t forget about that part, but you could probably ignore it if you want since it’s barely noticeable

I think with a bit more detail and refining the shape it could probably get in hof

2 he said it himself its a simple suspension, the fact that you failed to copy it and then had the fucking audacity to call it your own is just outright plagarism

3 even though you credited hars doesnt fix the issue, hars never gave you the permission to post your almost identical build which you admitted was the same.

plane-crazy 2021-12-04 15:39:10 lmao what is that
creations-chat 2021-12-04 18:50:00 this looks more like a modern 6 wheel apc than any sort of tank, 1st of all ur missing a ton of wheels, and 2nd it looks far too wide and not long enough to be a t55. Take the critism and improve or just give some excuses and cry like most people in <#504436696021204992> when they get real feedback instead of the sugarcoated shit their mother gives them, on the plus sides tho, the color scheme is nice and the general shape is there

creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:42:58 Ur not trying to have fun, you submitted your build for judgement, if you just want to have fun then don’t post, this entire channel exists to judge and criticize, if you can’t take real criticism and improve then go eat your chicken nuggets your mom made you and go get ready for another day of 2nd grade

<@!497073919547670528> it’s definitely a below average build, im not saying the builder sucks, they might be newer to the game and that’s ok, but if you post your build and just deny any feedback and refuse to accept that it’s below standards, that simply called being a child
creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:46:37 This is exactly what I meant about him being unable to accept actual feedback, if your fragile ego can be shattered by a bunch of online people on a roblox plane game after **YOU** posted your build for judgement, who’s fault is that

But since you asked, I’ll provide genuine feedback on what u can improve <@!750712383227428945>
creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:49:19 Was typing actual feedback but since you classified yourself as a brick wall and are unable to accept real suggestions, then go repeat the cycle of building, posting, and crying with your roomba
creations-chat 2021-12-07 20:54:36 Either way, heres feedback if you ever swallow ur ego and c o p e <@!750712383227428945> 

1. wings look like cheese graters, use motor flaps

2. Most planes aren’t pure angelic white, there always gonna be some dust/dirt, make it darker/add texture with materials 

3. I haven’t seen a plane with an octagonal body, try making it more rounded and taper it down towards the back (start the taper right behind the cockpit) like the real A6m

4. Wing shape is fucked, the leading edge of the a6m wing has a very very slight angle, the trailing edge doesn’t have a defined angle either, it shouldn’t have such a steep angle with the delta wing panels, try angle locking if you can. The wings are also *slightly* tilted up irl, I would try angle locking it if you can, it’s not super obvious so you don’t rlly need it if you don’t want

5. Wtf the the random wing panel behind the cockpit

6. The rear horizontal stabilizers on the a6m are positioned slightly in front of the vertical ones, the vertical stabilizer also has a noticeable curve at the top, not a flat edge,

Honest review coming up

Pretty obvious ur new to the game

Rocket spam in the back

Half the rockets aren’t painted

Paint looks horrendous

Your pilot seat is OUTSIDE the cockpit

You are relying purely on propellers to turn the plane and it looks like shit

Honestly all I can say is play the game more, look at others builds, learn what to do and what not to do.

Don’t post your beginner builds in creations and expect upvotes, the shit that actually gets upvoted in there takes hours or days to create and months to years of experience

Most importantly crying about negative feedback and arguing is only gonna make u look like an unde and/or clown
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 18:33:52 Looks like a mix of the rafael f18 and f16
creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:00:30 The plane he based it off of is the f35 and it has the sideways doors

creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:04:49 Do keep in mind the f4 is nearly 50 years older than the f35, also the design of the f4 might not have allowed for sideways doors

What I’m saying is, swing a piece of cardboard with the flat side then turn it 90 degrees and try it again lol

creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:41:57 Exactly, what is there to be learned
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:46:45 Make them actual towers instead of some bricks, 3 thousand people lost their lives and u spend maybe half an hour making 2 rushed towers with near 0 detail to depict the tragedy for some upvotes on a mf Roblox game. I try to be nice but ur pathetic, capitalizing on the lost lives of others just for some green fucking arrows

AND THERES A FUCKING PLANE

even if it’s not urs, you couldn’t take the time out of your day to get a different picture? Especially with this sensitive of a topic, how low can you get.
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:50:06 Yes we are because this is a fucking memorial, you need to take ur time building this, you cant rush this shit, it not just a. Bad build ur being disrespectful to the thousands of people who died and their families. 

Put in the hours or just delete that

The picture with the plane needs to be deleted, it makes the whole thing look like its fucking mocking the accident
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:54:09 It’s obvious you didnt put much effort into that since you said it urself ur too lazy to put fucking windows on the thing, memorials shouldn’t be rushed because its purpose is to honor those who died. You decided to fucking take a tragic event and try to get some upvotes, do you not see how this is just fucking morally wrong? Ive never been this mad at a build or its builder but this is fucking pushing it.
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:56:56 I may have gone slightly overboard with “fucking”, either way im not done
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:09:59 What part is “too much” i called them out for their mistake and told them how they could avoid it by not tryna farm upvotes with a memorial and just posting it in <#384021699466756107> or <#497142796961054721>

creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:29:32 Body is too undetailed and boxy 

part of the wing should tilt up

where the hell are the flaps

back view please

While on the topic of f4, what can i improve on mine, ill send after this dumbass cooldown
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:38:08 I think a few exposed motor are worth it since the wing tilt is pretty iconic and the propellers look even worse than exposed motors
creations-chat 2021-12-23 18:05:15 yo i have a lego set of this lol

<@!735168963146678474> paint the random grey spots the same color as the hull, color the motors too
creations-chat 2021-12-23 18:10:27 make the orange slightly less "vibrant" give it a weathered look
the wheels (idk what these r called, i dont know shit abt trains) could be more detailed since it looks plain rn
you could probably angle lock a ladder between the lights since theres a vent there
overall just add some depth by adding detail (vents, texture, doors, access panels etc)

<@!744591826891046943> normally you don’t want exposed lock unless there’s no way to hide it/the exposed lock would look better than an attempt to hide it, sometimes ppl use it for detail tho and it turns out ok

Love how this was motorlocked purely for the sake of motorlock,
creations-chat 2021-12-25 23:12:00 It’s the wings
creations-chat 2021-12-26 23:07:11 What the fuck, ik it’s for aesthetics but prolly motor lock a jet engine inside lol
creations-chat 2021-12-26 23:10:23 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> memes aside, genuinely looks good, shaping is spot on, proportions aren’t fucked up, details r all there, even the moving parts don’t have too much of a gap
creations-chat 2021-12-27 01:07:50 Hi
creations-chat 2021-12-27 13:14:03 That stug and strv just cleansed my eyes
creations-chat 2021-12-27 18:08:55 <@456226577798135808> unless you don’t know what beams are, no way that boat is 2.2k blocks

Well you cant apply for any ranks with that boat since artificially increasing ur block count by not using beams is against rules
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 18:23:24 Anyone know what these r?
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 18:23:51 Thinking abt build one of these since I have no ground stuff for pvp lol

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:03:13 the curve starts around the back of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:03:32 so 3-4 blocks from the start of the curve to the end
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:03:47 cant rlly tell from that photo

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:06:19 He used wedges 2
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:06:27 Yea he left out the curve
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:07:14 It’s pretty messy
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:07:37 It’s a 2020 plane tho so Ig yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:07:57 Imo the paint job doesn’t look great
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:08:28 Aircraft exhaust is pain
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:08:37 M yes bright pink
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:08:56 Best camouflage
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:09:26 Honestly I would just fix the paint
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:09:31 Then its pretty much fine
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:09:43 Angle lock time sob
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:17:00 Damn ren
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:17:06 He didn’t hide the gear
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:17:18 Well migh as well angle lock some landing gear doors
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 23:35:03 Angle locking hurts me

plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:47:42 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:47:46 Quantum
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:47:56 I locked the motors and left them powered and it worked fine
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:48:07 But for some reason when just launched
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:48:15 The motors locked and pull it sideways
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:48:22 Right after this pic
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:48:30 All I did was paint

plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:50:42 If you want a rlly good build u need to use them at some point
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:50:57 Hang on
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:06 
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:17 the canopy itself
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:21 isnt motor locked
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:31 it hurts to look at someone elses motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:38 but when you make it yourself and understand it
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:51:40 its pretty simple
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:52:25 I would look up some tutorials, build those planes, and **learn techniques from the tutorial**
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:52:57 Try to learn motor flaps
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:53:17 Much better then the default cheese graters

plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:55:30 My point exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:55:44 Looking at someone else’s lock makes you want to use bleach as eye drops
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:55:47 
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:55:49 aalso
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:56:00 visibility seems to be a trend in all my customs
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 00:56:28 I based it off the staff of homa from Genshin in a last ditch attempt to get it for my hu tao

plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:21:54 I would advise
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:22:15 Having the rockets inside
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:22:32 Also uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:22:45 Have u heard of hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:23:02 I advise searching them up
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:23:42 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 01:24:48 Interior
Horizontal and vertical stabilizers 
Rear landing gear
Landing gear doors for all gear

help 2021-12-28 19:48:28 Idk how to make the seamless flaps
creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:14:25 Didnt want to put this text wall in <#384025409945337856> 

My 1st plane that i put effort into was the F8, it sucked so I decided to remake it with a bunch of angle and motorlocking 
Idk if ill finish it so I'm posting this in <#384025409945337856> 
feel free to suggest some changes and give feedback beside "exposed motorlock"
canopy and gear both work
has gun "muzzle flash" effects
planning to add frames to the canopy, add interior, fix the wings (better flaps n stuff), add better armament, add better gear doors, add custom afterburner
Ill update if I ever get around to adding those changes
creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:18:13 one of the things im planning on adding, dunno if ill do this 1 bcuz of the way its motorlocked
creations-chat 2021-12-28 21:26:24 im pretty sure it did once, not sure if it was the f8 tho ill check

found a vid of the A6 sucking a pilot into an intake, he survived tho
creations-chat 2021-12-29 14:32:24 my f8 relies on a single tower, it is a 4 wide plane tho
creations-chat 2021-12-29 14:37:50 obviously you are new to the standards of the pcc, a newbie build isnt gonna get u anywhere, scroll up for a bit amd look at builds that get upvotes, then learn from them

creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:29:55 Attempted to make wave ripples but I’ve never tried building water

Ty <@!694299648059244574>

Yea that def needs to be improved, idk how to make it tho

ty <@!611251614178869269>
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:33:10 u think a mix of these 2 would work? <@!719168864705052802>

what did u mean?

i was gonna move the ripple behind the engine, rn it does look like a fucking boat wave
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:35:30 I can probably hide it, im removing the gear since I don’t need it for the model
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:41:12 The f8 has a different nose than the a7, I think it’s fine rn

Wings definitely need a fix

Should i shrink the cockpit or raise the spine?

Could u elaborate on “wider” ? Do u mean like make it a half block or change the shape

Where would u put the rockets? F8 has external hard points on the fuselage (image)

Ty for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:48:08 <@456226577798135808>

Tail should be shorter and wider

Wings are 2 straight angles when folded out, not a curve
creations-chat 2021-12-31 19:00:59 bro this was my 1st custom 💀 

the motorlock bomb would unlock everytime i launched rockets since i forgor to turn off powered, no intakes, no visible form of thrust, the whole damn wing turned to roll my plane and it still rolled like an a380
creations-chat 2021-12-31 20:06:35 moved the wings forward and made the angle consistent, it feels too far front tho, should i move it slightly back?
creations-chat 2021-12-31 20:09:25 alr, gonna work on angling the spine and hide the lock

creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:15:46 <@!702907851001167882> 

1. Lack of armor plates
2. Lack of detail
3. Barrel is a bit long
4. Lack of armor plates
5. The 4 cylinders aren’t angled too much, they mostly face the front instead of having the 4th cylinder face the side (dunno how to explain this 1 well)
6. missing antenna/antenna should be longer on your tank
7. “Lines” on the barrel

8. Add some color diversity (ik I didnt circle this 1), use multiple very close shades of green if possible, recolor the mg up top and some of the antenna
creations-chat 2022-01-01 17:25:05 I think an easy way for detail/armor plating is just to put some trails as separation between plates, overall a solid build but could be improved upon

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:05:30 Red is tnt or springs
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:05:38 Yellow is cylinder or wing
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:05:47 And purple is where you attach blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:07:31 And never use a single motorlock tower for pvp planes unless you want your plane to shatter to pieces when a single rocket hits the afterburner
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 16:08:23 <:EYES:525319504721608705>

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 21:53:54 <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2022-01-07 21:56:33 Chicago and Detroit is the “pull up” kind of shot, Florida is more of “accidentally getting hit by a falling bullet from ppl shooting the fucking sun”

Texas is the “gtfo my land” kind of shot
creations-chat 2022-01-07 21:58:46 Nah ny is more of getting a “shot” under a bridge

events-chat 2022-01-09 02:44:08 It’s a pvp event right?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:47:10 I think having a stupidly small and fast boat is the way to go, bigger ships r gonna be slow as hell so u can just drive circles around em and bomb

Then again ur gonna be dead if a single rockets slaps u
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:50:27 Wait so rocket engines are allowed…?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:51:17 It says “jet engines”
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:51:36 So rockets and propellers are fair game?
YOO

Speedy boi time
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:53:26 I’m not flying, I’m simply performing a very long guided jump
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:58:21 My boat is simply aerodynamically competent

events-chat 2022-01-09 03:04:43 I’m gonna thrust vector my boat

events-chat 2022-01-09 15:33:19 And add moar thrust to counter water resistance

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:48:11 Moment there’s criticism they quit
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:48:46 Here’s the lights
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:48:49 *wheres
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:49:04 And the viewport (I think?)
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:49:38 What r u building
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:49:43 That’s a massive intake
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:50:19 Tbh just dont build tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:50:44 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:50:57 Some tutorials hold u back
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:51:07 The ones that just teach u how to build a certain thing block for block
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:51:26 You need to find some that teach you techniques
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:52:29 With that kind of mindset obviously you can’t because you don’t wanna put in the time
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:52:56 Plane crazy has a decent learning curve but it gets real fun once you get the hang of detailing
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:53:03 Quick tip
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:53:21 Don’t make the entirety of the body before you motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 19:53:33 Public pvp lmao

creations-chat 2022-01-11 19:59:26 He speaks the truth
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:00:00 Well building a shredder is taking 10 steps back
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:15 Ur gonna get bullied for using shredders bro
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:23 I’m tryna help
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:32 Don’t go down that rabbit hole
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:39 After you build that shredder
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:44 You play a bit of pvp
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:47 It gets boring
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:02:57 No one will want to spawn in to play with you

plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:05:05 Paint where
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:05:28 Aaa I still don’t have a pvp tank
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:05:52 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:05:57 Ngl I liked the f104
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:06:08 Just could have more detail and paint
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:07:25 Is an armored car easier than a tank? I don’t have any land stuff for pvp beside a massive fuckin roomba

Armed only with a few cutters and 2 lava spitters
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:07:55 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:08:27 I just didn’t want to build the tracks lmao, building actual treads would make it shit for pvp, making a bunch of wheels would make it look like crap
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:08:38 Oooh excited for that
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:09:59 Was thinking of building the embodiment of suffering
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:14:28 Kinda gave up on the su 57 cuz of that
plane-crazy 2022-01-11 20:14:42 Ironically I’m turning it into a star fighter

creations-chat 2022-01-11 23:08:04 Instead of the cylinder light spam at the front, try to make a framed bar light
add texture variations instead of just slate
the parts around the crane are bare and under detailed, add boxes or sum shet
Wheels could use work

creations-chat 2022-01-13 20:29:36 Green is urs, red is irl
Missing window frames, window incorrect shape, missing half the windows, engines are bigger and mounted **below** the wing, ur propellors are fucking tiny use motors and custom props, should be more space between the top of the windshields and the top of the plane, overall the entire front needs a redesign, and having a bunch of text with switches doesn’t look good, your cockpit needs shape, slanted control panels, control stick, buttons, etc

Yes ik the picture is an ac-130 but it’s basically just a c-130 with a shit load of big guns on 1 side

**why is there 2 gallons of fuel INSIDE the cargo bay to fuel a 4 engine, 155000 pound cargo aircraft**

Yea I see it, i doubt it was intentional tho
creations-chat 2022-01-14 13:59:41 Doesn’t look like grass, I would change the texture and darken it to contrast the tank a bit
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:16:22 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:16:37 If motorlock work with rope between it then ig it could work
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:03 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:07 But if u wanna make a net
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:28 You need to be able to put ropes between the bombs
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:35 So it would open to a giant net
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:40 That would be cool ngl
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:19:47 Add a shit load of ballast
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:20:04 You can trap tanks and go boom boom if you have a plane with enough power
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:22:12 No like
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:22:21 Make a motorlock bomb tower right
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:22:26 And put ropes between ‘em
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:22:33 So when you expand it
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:22:37 It doesn’t fall apart
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:23:32 No cuz it would be a small area
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:23:59 And it would just be a falling motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:25:04 Still
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:25:12 It’s just a falling motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:25:12 It’s just a falling motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:29:01 I’m gonna experiment with the net idea
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:29:26 I like the idea of a weighted explosive net
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:29:53 Make it weight like 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:30:08 And make it cover a huge area
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 14:30:21 Massive middle finger to whoever’s on the ground
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:02:08 I’ll give feedback later, I’m in a class rn
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:20:11 1. Paint the wheels/sprockets black
2. Add some more color variation, i dont mean shades of green i mean like grey, black, etc
3. The grass was cool (a weathered/slightly beat up jungle version would be a nice break from all the plastic tanks in <#384025409945337856> )
4. If you do the weathered look add some rust texture
5. The front middle of the tank looks empty

Overall the thing that needs the most attention is color variation, she shades of green are nice its just that 99% of the tank is green
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:25:19 Ig ill start on a tank/armored car once i get home, maybe test out the bomb net idea and add some final touches on my boat
events-chat 2022-01-14 16:26:21 Oh god
events-chat 2022-01-14 16:26:40 I feel like a 3 wide boat wasnt smart after scrolling through <#917397949938548736> lmao
creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:36:26 1. The wheels/sprockets could use mode detailing instead of just some cylinders 
2. Tracks should be black/grey shades
3. Paint those inner blocks next to the light the same color as the sides so  it blends in

creations-chat 2022-01-14 16:56:06 A spanish maus
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:01:07 It’s all just painting wdym space?

1. Make those the same color
2. Change those to black or grey imo, the front has a ton of green and needs some contrast
3. Tracks and sprockets should be black
4. Barrel should be a more consistent color/what are the lines (trails) around it?

We finally have a good tank in the works, there’s some stuff to be improved but it has huge potential
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:05:34 Tbh a few text 1x1 with some emojis or text would be enough, it doesn’t have to hyperdetailed/motorlocked
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:08:59 Ah alr, 

the actual structure of ur tank is amazing, i said this a ton before but just color variation lol

Same with that l3 in creations rn
Add some grey shading/texture, the structure is pretty good
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:12:47 Might be a copy but to be fair the maus is a pretty simple shape and there’s not much variation to it

Tf is the rocket placement

creations-chat 2022-01-15 02:09:53 Also you got hella lazy with this, its completely the wrong shape and it’s too short because the body is too short

creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:04:35 Magnets or anchoring one half, then using engines to maneuver it together and anchor, use interlacing blocks with dis connectors or something similar on the edges to align them perfectly

Shitty drawing but I’m on my phone on a moving vehicle
creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:12:09 Yep, but I think it would make it a lot better and let u put planes on it
creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:16:32 I highly doubt, carriers are overbuilt so you need to put in a ton of effort for a good carrier since the standards are so high, plus 3 fold is the average
creations-chat 2022-01-18 14:22:07 I can try to help once I get home, or I can try building the back, but I won’t have my computer for another 8 hours so…

To answer the question, I would make a new save slot for it in case you ever decide to change your mind, then start deleting stuff too close/you don’t need, use your old carrier as reference to rebuild certain parts

creations-chat 2022-01-20 22:00:35 Lmao it’s called sarcasm

Having no motorlock isn’t a flex, it’s a sign that you don’t know how to/aren’t willing to spend time doing it
creations-chat 2022-01-20 22:43:52 Is a **sign**, I didn’t say that having no motorlock = bad
general 2022-01-21 01:29:41 NO

creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:13:23 Idk, I tried making something similar to that for my jet but I couldn’t get the trees and terrain right
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:15:50 Yea the road is a bit too low and wide for such a smal tank, if it was the size of the king tiger in hog then the road would be fine

<@!652925710976942100> use piston lock for the lights to make them appear thin
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:27:05 Yea but the main focus of the build is the tank, having such a deep road and small tank kinda draws the attention away and makes it look disproportionate, raise the road by half a block and make the trees not look like an enlarged rpg
creations-chat 2022-01-21 16:31:49 Making some areas deeper could work, just try to raise the tank to be the center of attention

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:00:33 It’s got cities, water, plenty of roads
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:00:43 There better be a center water area lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:01:04 Otherwise you can escape a ship battle by going Mach 12 across the ocean

creations-chat 2022-01-24 17:58:47 It seems like you started playing 2 days ago, I advise using motorlock and angle locking if you wanna build for detail, just using wedges won’t get you very far

Bruh no way you’ve been playing for 2 years without angle lock

Angle locks can wait, motor locking is a key part of pc detailing tho
creations-chat 2022-01-24 18:04:17 It’s messy but

Missing railing

Missing window frames
Missing a slope on the front

plane-crazy 2022-01-26 23:03:17 Yea we know

plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:36:19 There
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:36:46 I know for a fact that didn’t take 3 months
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:38:40 My tip
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:38:50 Don’t have curvy wings that end with a slope
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:39:00 Always end a wing with a flat edge
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:39:15 Lemme show u what I mean 1 sec
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:40:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 22:40:16 Ending wings off like that looks more realistic
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 23:04:40 hm
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 23:04:54 i would angle lock a bit of the back
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 23:04:56 but
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 23:05:10 idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-27 23:05:14 it looks a bit off

plane-crazy 2022-01-30 17:59:43 Yo does anyone know if a flying wing aircraft would have pitch and roll issues in pc?
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 18:00:16 I build an f7 cutlass and it’s got dogshit turning but idk if it’s because of me messing something up or if it’s just the design on the plane in general

events-chat 2022-01-30 18:17:55 <@!466793357318815744> would bombers be able to fold wings and stuff outside the plot? Being slow and unable to evade makes a pretty easy target so larger wing/body area would be nice

You cant be a bomber, only the hosts are the bombers

You cant have tnt blocks unless it’s to freeze a motorlock tower 

You cant go above 350 sps

You cant have super rockets
events-chat 2022-02-04 21:42:19 We’ll rockets cap at 300 so
events-chat 2022-02-04 21:53:41 Well yea no shit

events-chat 2022-02-04 21:55:06 I mean thrust vectoring helps but

events-chat 2022-02-04 21:59:10 Also no one is gonna bother with proper terms in a lego game competition, where a ww2 flying wing, can out turn a modern f22 and do a 180 faster then an Asian mom armed with a slipper after realizing you got a b- on your math test
events-chat 2022-02-04 21:59:27 I think 5k, saw it somewhere earlier but forgor where

events-chat 2022-02-08 02:33:18 People care about looks, i could make a plane that couldn’t even function but looks fucking amazing and it would probably get more upvotes than a plane at the pinnacle of pvp

events-chat 2022-02-08 14:00:19 Make it like wt
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:01:59 If you had enough people space climbing with those 6 engines and just kamikazing the carrier then it might be a really easy cheap way to win
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:02:54 If we both get in then maybe
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:03:34 How many submissions are we allowed to make? I might use the biplane since rockets are far more reliable and less likely to blow up in ur face
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:03:53 Also the maneuverability is stupidly good
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:04:15 You can literally cober in the biplane with no mods
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:05:01 Are we allowed to use different plane for attack/defense?
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:06:41 If it’s gonna be like each team gets one attack and one defense round then the bomber is probably the worst choice you can possibly make
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:07:14 Sure you *might* be able to be some help in the attack round but ur gonna be fukin useless in the defense round
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:07:53 The bomber needs serious buff or it’s literally just gonna be a meme
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:08:28 You get one chance to land your bomb on the attack round and you can’t do jack shit on defense round
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:09:13 Honestly the Tin can can probably do 2-3x the damage  that the bomber can do
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:09:30 You gotta hope for some dumbasses on the enemy team then
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:10:03 How many people are on a team?
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:10:44 It’s slow as shit and can’t pitch to save its life
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:11:00 Imo the biplane or tin can are the best

They didn’t specify what you put on the turret

Correction they didn’t specify how many guns on the turret
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:12:49 Biplane is best choice to me, it’s more powerful than the doof, more guns than tincan so it’s a better defender, might be a bit lacking on offensive but you sure as hell won’t get shot down, we don’t even need to talk about the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:13:59 Yea
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:15:16 Either needs a nerf or the bomber needs serious help
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:20:37 Yea, best tactic with the bomber is to distract the enemy so your team can get some runs and kamikaze when you know ur going down
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:24:48 I would just space climb then dive for it
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 14:28:26 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/752219509171028048/940441704404774922/cope_slope.gif
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:57:18 Sbd dauntless lma
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:57:50 That’s the point of the bomber
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:58:35 Mitchel is 2 engine, imagine a b36, b47 etc attacking a carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:59:27 Literally the point of the planes is to be agile and a fucking nightmare to hit
events-chat 2022-02-08 14:59:49 The bomber is the opposite
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:00:06 Use picture lma

Also there’s a helium block behind the pilot seat
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:01:14 Imma wait for any changes before I submit, if nothing changes I’m using biplane
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:02:50 Doof is too underpowered as an attacker imo
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:03:39 You need to think which plane will be good for both roles, the only one that really shines in both is the biplane
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:03 The tincan is fragile and clunky to fly, shoot the landing gear and it’s fucked

The gun placement in biplane is perfect for tearing apart planes
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:36 Especially since they added a third gun
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:04:57 I put it in front of canopy so it’s a triangle fire pattern with a rocket under it
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:05:31 That’s why you don’t use fireworks
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:03 Plus rocket can work on carrier
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:30 Actually if you mount the turret under the bomber it might work as a distraction while you beam the carrier under you
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:06:55 Sorta
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:07:29 Ez
events-chat 2022-02-08 15:08:06 Plus you have 2nd layer of wing

events-chat 2022-02-08 17:42:13 No
events-chat 2022-02-08 17:42:31 For Yousuf just fly stupidly close to carrier, drop your torpedos and bombs on flight deck, shoot off the rockets, re arm, restart

events-chat 2022-02-08 17:45:05 Torpedos are the worse because they’re literally worse bombs
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:00:17 Torpedos are weak bombs, technically you can drop the bomb in water and call it a torpedo and you have 2x the firepower with bomb
events-chat 2022-02-08 18:00:36 Rockets r still the best tho
events-chat 2022-02-08 21:55:56 Just put a rocket under it lmao

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 14:00:14 Biplane would be better

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 04:30:30 Polynomials are fucking stupi
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 04:31:37 people can voice their opinions without your prompting. Dunno if you realized but “didnt ask” or anything along those lines, just shows that you cant come up with a valid point, and defend it against an opposing view, its the quickest thing your brain could come up with to hide your poor debating skills and stop your head from being pulled out from its little could and into reality. It also shows your inability to take other views into consideration, and the inability to restrain yourself from going on a discussion where people were enjoying their time and commenting your shitty message just to have a little laugh or boost your massive ego. I advise googling “12 traits of a bad leader, that message single-handedly represented traits 1, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12. 

Last of all the fact that you couldn’t be bothered to take 5 minutes out of your day to type out something meaningful is sad, the people in chat are being quite nice to your for the unprovoked attack, whether you see this or not doesn’t concern me, hopefully anyone who sees this can learn from this and make the internet generally a better place to be.

Love how this shit flies better than 90% of my planes yet looks like a fucking burnt burrito with burnt Doritos stuck into its side
creations-chat 2022-02-13 04:01:16 paint ideas? im working on vertical stabilizer and figuring out how to put horizontal stabilizer on since i have like 3 fuking blocks of space at the back

how to i make it maneuver better lma, rolls like a 747 and cant pitch for shit
creations-chat 2022-02-13 04:04:39 F104 but enlarged and forward, due to the wing shape i cant rlly move it back

Ill try moving them back if i have room after im done, i still have quite a bit to add on to the body
creations-chat 2022-02-13 04:07:12 im mainly just worried about these 2 towers colliding, i can prolly do something tho

should i add stabilizers at the back and fix body 1st or move intakes?

creations-chat 2022-02-14 16:05:03 I started off with draken wings for mine, you need assisted steering with props since they won’t roll for shit and if you use them to pitch then you can’t roll without fat ass canards

general 2022-02-22 13:27:52 What the fard is the wing placement
events-chat 2022-02-22 14:01:20 It’s by far the worst out of the 3 unless you want to play kamikaze
events-chat 2022-02-22 14:01:45 Basically the yousuf of this event since you get 2 tries to kill a massive enemy
events-chat 2022-02-22 14:02:04 After that ur flak bait
creations-chat 2022-02-22 14:02:55 Fard nose
I would angle it
creations-chat 2022-02-22 17:26:37 Looks like a public server build, with the amount of “edits” needed to fix that it’s gonna be a new ship

Also delete it since you admitted that it’s a wip
contest-chat 2022-02-22 17:29:19 When 0 gravity
events-chat 2022-02-22 17:42:13 1 piece pops off and ur balance go bye bye
creations-chat 2022-02-22 17:59:26 Lo whitename
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:33:24 That’s the entire fucking point of this channel, we aren’t gonna sugar coat shit and go “ohh wow ur soo good omg but maybe possibly ignore me you don’t have to listen but these parts maybe kinda aren’t amazing and flawless. There’s no point to that elementary bullshit, some people can’t take actual feedback and their massive ego automatically validates everything they do and makes excuses for why parts of their build is shit (“oh I can’t fit it, oh I’m still new”), just troubleshoot and fix the problem instead of being a bitch about it

<@!401530469952389130> 

to summarize this horrible argument and person
1. chunktheory is a narcissist 
2. he can’t take feedback
3. fragile ego
4. people who try to give him feedback apparently get accused of bias against him (he literally takes everything personally)
5. literally looks for any possible way to start an argument

(Credit to fleet lol)
plane-crazy 2022-02-22 20:34:07 Man
creations-chat 2022-02-22 20:37:03 Not rlly, you should see arguments about 9/11 related builds
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:41:29 Either way it’s still gonna be by far the worst out of the 3 unless it’s a motorlocked cluster bomb which utilizes at least 50 tnt

Reason? You get one shot and after that ur only purpose is a meat shield
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:43:54 Doesnt change the fact that you have 1 shot of a missile in a game with shit collision physics
creations-chat 2022-02-22 21:46:59 1. Cool

2. Never gave feedback, never even talked to you

3. Did i say you did?

4. Havent pinged you u til now

5. How would u know my age again? Don’t remember telling you
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:48:09 Doesnt change the fact that you get 1 shot while every other class has infinite, same problem as Yousuf from carrier event before they buffed it with downwards rockets
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:48:37 Or choose a different class and macro rockets
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:49:07 That what I mean by macro lo
creations-chat 2022-02-22 21:51:49 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

plane-crazy 2022-02-22 23:45:16 i would try a simple plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 00:47:20 OGMM COPY
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:55:05 Is that the tut apc
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:56:42 Motorlock wing panels into it
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:56:49 I remember using that ages ago
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:56:56 Constantly oversteers
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:57:06 Stick vertical wing panels in the back
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 13:57:37 Gives a nice drift effect too while not being uncontrollable asf

creations-chat 2022-02-23 21:20:39 About 1.5 blocks lol

Good luck fitting tracks, body, and the tall part w gun

I might make one as a side project
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:28:50 This is the one event I would attempt to make the ships as large as possible since the max speed is so slow and the ships armament is pathetic, being massive and able to tank shots might be better than being harder to hit since ships get turrets
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 21:29:23 Reverse tail hook for carrier landings
events-chat 2022-02-23 21:36:26 I guess a smaller ship could work especially against the torpedo airship since it’s gonna be near impossible to hit it with torpedos unless it’s a cluster bomb
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 22:15:39 The cool anime
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 22:36:01 Read <#925522972586967092>
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 22:38:28 Read all of it lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 22:38:41 Always good to read stuff you should know before talking in a server
events-chat 2022-02-23 23:05:37 I think the torpedo is more of a risky choice, they didn’t specify how much tnt could be used and never forbade motorlock, if you know the missile design I was testing recently it just might work

I’ll hop in vip 1 later
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:06:00 Tailed

plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:07:07 Bet
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:07:15 The missile I tested on your swarm
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:07:25 I’m gonna compact that
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:07:30 And remove guidance
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:07:37 And stick it on the torpedo airship
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:08:25 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 23:08:48 Either I blow their ass out of the sky or i miss and blow myself to shit

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:54:01 After a while you’ve seen too many of them lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:54:51 I’m guessing most of us have built a tut
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:54:54 Or use 1
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:55:06 Tailed uses a heavily modified a-10 tut
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:55:21 But it’s been modified to the point where you have no clue what it is lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:55:57 Rn it’s a neko plane with a bit of ace combat mashed into thrust vectoring a-10 engines and canards
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:56:22 I used the vulpen f-4 for a while since it had massive wings for bombs

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:56:55 I used mini apc for a while

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:58:38 Didn’t even look like a shredder and was cool asf
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:58:54 Those kinds of shreds r ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:59:10 I forgot I built that tut lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:59:53 I had the lambo v-12
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 14:00:15 I used the sub tut until the boat event

creations-chat 2022-03-04 18:24:19 Ass colors and turret is a bit small

Make the colors closer and less vibrant
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:25:36 Its ass

Is it for pvp? I’m guessing yes since you made it explosive

First of all I personally prefer slider tanks since it eliminates wheels as a weak spot

Secondly, you need a turret, not just personal preference, a pvp build is shit without a turret
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:32:00 From that picture it’s absolute crap, I could kill that before your rocket even passes your windshield 

No turret
No armor, can be instantly killed with a singular firework
Frontal wing panels mess with turning, made even worse since your only way to aim is with turning
Wheels are an easy target
220 sps isnt much

creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:17:18 Bro I thought that was a 1 wide titanic and shit urself
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:26:57 I’m taking a break from building looks and starting to invest into pvp

<@!389516889501728779> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/949748458292654081
Anything I can add for pvp and where? And maybe small aesthetic fixes
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:38:55 Dunno what to do about engines, it’s either 1x1, 2x2, or 3x3

Wdym by fix spine? Should I taper it down closer to nose?

I can switch between glitched and wasd, I didn’t use motor 2 for this one

For pvp, was asking if there’s an optimal rocket or gun placement, I spread the rockets out a bit for a higher chance of hitting something

Next thing I’m gonna do is try to rig a few cluster bombs on it
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:42:01 Worth slapping fireworks inside or no? 

I’ll fix spine rn 

Glitched mouse is poo

Would fireworks work for ground attack?
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 20:38:25 No
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 20:38:31 I use em for cluster missiles

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:36:27 well then
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:36:33 send an image
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:36:45 missiles without motorlock are generally shit tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:36:57 fuckin neckbeard
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:37:11 mistake
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:37:26 to me you can only really play 10% of the game without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:37:38 once you learn motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:37:41 shit gets real fun
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:03 alti
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:05 
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:12 why the fuck are you arguing with this kind of person
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:23 yea i would restart
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:25 1
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:28 that missile wont do shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:31 2
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:35 3 wide missile sucks
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:38:40 1 wide is far better
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:13 volkswagens r shite bro
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:17 thats not a fair comparison
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:24 its comparing a tank to a peel p50
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:34 look at his about me
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:53 these kind of peopls make me wanna move back to taiwan lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:57 people*
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:39:59 cant spell for shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:40:19 <@!726812607062736917>
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:40:25 1 wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:40:29 guided
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:40:53 plus this bas about 40 blocks of tnt
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:00 i can give you a lesson on motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:07 and teach u how to build a simple guided missile
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:10 doesnt take very long
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:35 thrust and control surfaces here
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:41 
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:43 more control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:51 
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:41:54 motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:42:05 they dont work
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:42:09 theyre cluster
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:42:30 you cant cram as much tnt into the tip
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:42:43 = very low damage
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:42:50 not worth imo
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:01 no like
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:09 bombs go through everything
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:12 except 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:14 whichi idk
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:21 trusting gjsolo on this
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:31 tnt in the back wont do shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:44 yep
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:49 when you motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:51 10x better
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:43:55 use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:44:06 and you can have 150 explosive blocks crammed in a 10x1x1 space
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:08:56 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:08:57 simple
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:00 motor
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:05 upside down motor on top of that
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:16 right side up motor sattached to the side of upside down
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:21 basically
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:22 tower
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:09:23 ez
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:27 simple
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:29 basically
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:35 
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:38 wing panel there
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:42 instead of a rocket
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:45 or a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:14:54 ur not rlly supposed to put stuff between the towers
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:19:52 yoooo good job
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:20:24 nah
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:20:31 i hate using the front and back for propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:20:39 theres much better stuff you can fit there
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:20:45 especially on small planes
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:00 i use sides for propulsion
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:04 middle for detailing
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:21 are you in a pub server?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:34 i can join for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:21:44 also
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:22:09 make sure you dont hahve anything right on top of each other
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:22:21 there has to be a gap otherwise ur holding the motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:22:46 unreliable, takes a shit ton of space, no speed variation
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:21 "if i had a penny for every mig 25 with excessively large bombs, i would have 2 pennies, not much but weird it happened twice"
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:34 convs cant be motorlocked into other blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:37 aw
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:23:46 why the fat engines
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:02 hovers give up power for speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:33 you cant have stuff touching the conveyor or piston iirc
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:42 ik
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:46 but still unreliable
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:49 glitchy
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:24:58 and no speed variation
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:09 only for big spaceships tbh
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:25:18 hover drives make ur plane perform like an actual plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:29:42 not enough wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:10 im tryna make an atv buggy tank thingy
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:13 to climb around
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:24 i typically build a plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:27 and shove hovers in there
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:34 and keep adding em until it starts wobbling
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:30:44 im at 18 on my mig 25
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 02:31:31 your thrust vectoring system is actually cool tho

creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:19:41 Not even close, you’ve run out of valid responses and just resorted to saying “refrain from toxicity”, you realized that doesn’t work and finally scraped together enough brain cells to fuck off

creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:27:49 You literally put the wrong plane, the ghost of Kiev is a mig 29, the mig 25 is this bro https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/949805552584757358

Even for a mig 29 it still looks bad
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 23:14:32 Clearly hasn’t seen motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 23:14:35 Or my mig 25

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 23:15:06 1.5k top speed without bombs
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 23:15:12 That’s pointless
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 23:15:22 A micro fighter without motorlock is called laziness
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:16:27 A good part of the server would just die completely
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:19:11 Personally I like the high standards and high punishments of creations feedback, when you build something that actually meets those standards and don’t get pinged with “delete” it feels pretty good. Kinda helps you push urself to be better instead of just getting discouraged because you aren’t willing to spend 30 minutes learning motorlock
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:27:49 Also the general negativity in this chat generally comes from builds with builders that aren’t willing to improve/post 5 fucking times and showed 0 progress and flood <#384025409945337856> with crappy builds. Seeing a builder with a genuine passion to improve and take feedback is a rare but good sight to see, always try to give actual feedback to these people

creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:50:40 Bro I got school, physical classes, track team, cello class, equivalent of all ap classes for middle school and I still squeeze out pretty good builds, quit crying about it here and do something productive and good for your mental health
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:53:21 1 blocked message, cellos carry the orchestra

YEAAA <@!297120728342331392>
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:55:24 Don’t use that as an excuse to not put huge effort into builds, if ur happy with what you can build right now with your mental limits then I don’t see a reason to whine about it, not sure why you brought it up here since we really can’t help unless anyone here is a certified mental health professional which I seriously doubted
creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:59:14 When did I say I have to? I said I “can”. Also my previous point stands, if ur happy with what you can built with your limitations then shouldn’t that be enough? You said it urself, it’s meant to be played and enjoyed during free time, if ur enjoying your builds then I don’t get why ur whining

Also why did you even bring it up
<@!752908414371233793> see if you can motorlock some disconnectors or trapdoors behind those signs

Also make the colors a bit more contrasting/shade it

plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:08:43 Lava spitter and cutters for 8
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:08:51 And send detonate for last one
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:08:56 I can move
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:09:06 Wheels are just there for extra friction and to look good
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:09:17 I have lava spitters and cutters inside my tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:09:33 Shooting the turret off just stops me from being an anti air gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:11:07 Center of lift and center of gravity need to line up
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:11:22 And the piston rope thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:11:29 If you really want a swashplate like that
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:11:32 Use springs
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 16:11:40 They can stretch but hold their shape

creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:11:19 Shitty camo

Some detailing should be slightly darker to bring out the shape
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:18:08 Bad wording sry, I mean some detailing (text on signs, antenna) should be bit darker to add contrast and bring out shape, basically make it look like you didnt paint bucket, maybe text or sparklers in the wheels but that might take a while

<@456226577798135808> cope

I’m nowhere near ppl like double, cramming that much detail in a tiny build is just insane to me, I tried a roscale firebird and still can’t figure out to do the grille lol
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:22:21 I have no interest in making one of the most overbuilt helis in this game

<@456226577798135808> point made, sometimes I would give up some realism for better aesthetics tho, real life ain’t flawless
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:24:29 I know damn well I could if it wasn’t roscale, roscale Huey is fuckin tiny

<@456226577798135808> you do better than this before you start saying I can’t build

Fixed the shitty painting on the belly, ignore that one blue block lol
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:27:04 Urs isn’t even close to roscale dumbfuck, you build your best roscale Huey and I promise I’ll do one better

<@!297120728342331392> I can see 3.5 body and 3 nose but 4 is really pushing it
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:29:17 But yea, to answer your question could use better coloring and detail on wheel, still got my upvote tho

<@!401530469952389130> wait where?

I saw a good Huey in vip1 once, forgor if it was roscale tho
creations-chat 2022-03-12 20:32:31 Urs is 4 wide dumbass, it’s far too big, huey irl doesn’t have enough room for an average adult to stand up straight

Waiting to the end to paint is a mistake
events-chat 2022-03-24 13:34:56 WOOO
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:36:05 That way you can see if there’s any weird clipping and fix it before you finish the whole damn thing and it becomes a pain in the ass to edit a single block

<@!588596347272167456> or read this and realize your mistake

Bruh have you heard of trying to make a nice livery? Can’t just paint it the same color

Kinda found out the hard way with my f-10
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:39:24 Then at least you realize you don’t like the paint before you paint the whole thing, then you only have to repaint one part

Either way, this is how I build so

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 00:16:32 1 hit and ur plane is unbalanced
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 00:16:57 If u shoot off the wings I doubt that can fly well
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 00:17:11 And control surface damage would make it shit itself

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 00:26:26 I don’t care what anyone says, fleet is legit the reason why mental hospitals exist. He is the reason why schools have shortbuses. Ima get hate for this but, Fleet is the real furry, mans hating on a good build because his self esteem is too low for him to be satisfied with himself and not be a jerk to people just because they haven’t learned all the best stuff. There is a difference between needlessly putting someone down and offering them good advice without being a :clownmoment:

plane-crazy 2022-04-03 17:33:09 Only 1 wide tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 17:33:19 Conveyor is 3 minimum
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:05 you cant have anything next to it
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:18 plus its one speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:24 imo hovers are just better
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:35 since conveyor isnt compatable with any motorlock lmao
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:40 since when
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:04:46 last time i tried that it just died
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:01 still
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:03 hovers >>
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:10 variable speed
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:16 less buggy
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:22 no??
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:26 its all or nothing
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:05:38 you can change the speed in build mode but thats it
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:06:05 ^^
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:06:17 i only use it for big jet
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:06:19 as a boost
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:06:22 to gtfo
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:06:48 i build 1 wide so hovers are better for me lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:07:06 most of my planes dont have more than 3 blocks of empty space inside
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:07:35 yea
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:07:42 i typically go for 800-900
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:07:49 anything more is excessive
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:07:56 any less and ur just target practice
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:08:22 lmao i go for 3k
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:08:26 cuz like
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:08:29 if its a panic button
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:08:36 might as well go fast
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:08:57 no one can do shit to something going 3k
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:09:17 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:10:42 even if it can outrun it

plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:06:32 no building skills
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:06:36 the wing angle is horrid
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:07:08 anyone mind putting an overlay on that
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:09:54 2/10
1. get rid of holes in wings
2. tail extends too far back and not sloped
3. tf is that nose
4. camo is far too light 
5. wing angle wrong
6. bruh fix the canards entirely
7. fix droptanks
8. intakes need to curve into the fuselage
9. fix vertical stabalizer
10. no detail
11. fix canopy

plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:14:03 nothing i can do bout that
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:14:56 fr tho onbly 200 motors
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 20:15:11 not a lot for such a big build
creations-chat 2022-04-03 22:42:02 <@!466793357318815744> 
see if you can have the body sit a bit lower and bend the legs a bit since that 90 degree angle looks unnatural 

<@!918581321004089364> add the box in front of the tower, add windows/the gaps in the tower, make the panel material wood and paint it so it doesn't look like plastic, add detail like the bolts, wiring, and pipes

your pc performance doesn't matter and its not an excuse to have a shitty build, fps doesn't mean shit when ur taking a screenshot

creations-chat 2022-04-05 13:11:55 Not even fucking close
The front shape is completely wrong

I don’t think the p-47 had fucking slits in the wings

P-47 didn’t have wings that looked like fucking paper

The taper to the back is way too steep

Whole body shape is wrong

Should be more curved instead of an angled brick

I don’t give a flying fuck if you spent 4 years measuring shit, I would rather upvote something that actually looks good

The p-47 is a pretty nice looking plane and you saying its “the most accurate possible” is just plain bullshit

Redo it, I don’t even wanna mention the colors since it’s been brought up 4 times and you clearly don’t care about actual feedback

Cry bout it whitename

creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:41:14 No one gives a shit, I built a 1.3k build on fuckin intergrated graphics, rarely getting over 30 fps and you don’t hear me crying bout it. Shitty pc isn’t an excuse for shitty build

Also the shape is just so wrong, not even a shitty pc can justify that

Instead of accepting feedback and improving you just keep making excuses for your skill issue

creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:47:51 If you wanna play it then stop tryna defend how ass it looks, this server doesn’t give a shit how good it flies or if it doesn’t fly at all

All ur excuses for being shit at building just revolve around “oh I have a shit pc” or “oh boo hoo I wanna play pvp”

Just build a dedicated pvp plane and quit tryna merge the 2, it’s only gonna make it look ass and be shit at pvp
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:51:40 How would I not understand that, I have a low end pc myself and I’m not using that as an excuse to make dogshit builds, I actually think a few of my builds are pretty decent

creations-chat 2022-04-06 16:23:08 <@!410992368494575626> nice to see some of your builds again, wings look a bit low effort compared to the rest of the plane tho, the random hole kinda emphasizes
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:24:24 Isn’t that the old one, im pretty sure his su 57 doesn’t look like that

creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:54:02 That general frame would be abysmal for pvp, an optimal pvp tank had minimal weak points to shoot at, the entire lower half of your tank is a weak point

I would say at least 700-1000 speed if you really want to use it since shooting out a leg basically ruins your tank
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:59:06 Even in public it might be an issue, the tank I built has wheels purely for decor and bait to keep internals safe, I also added a lower camera frame to if the wheels get shot out I still “float” on them

creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:05:11 <@456226577798135808> time doesn’t matter, someone can spend weeks building something, and it might not even get a fraction of the upvotes a good hour long build from a good builder would get


I know this firsthand since a random joke build I spent an hour on got me exp 5 and more upvotes than 90% of the current shit in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:12:09 ???

First you weren’t even the one who posted it

Second, it doesn’t only look bad, it looks like the average shitty public server build
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:15:53 Can’t really tell, there’s not enough contrast for me to see much lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:37:17 Light block and angle locked trails

Snow pipes only work in anchor
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:17 
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:25 Purple is light block
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:32 Yellow is the first ring of trails
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:51 Orange is a 2nd ring hidden in the trail of first one
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:56 But
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 18:39:56 Dunno if that made sense
creations-chat 2022-04-09 18:48:48 It could be so much better

1. Colors are ass
2. Missing the ropes and stuff hanging from the cranes or wtvr those are
3. Ur missing a whole fucking crane
4. No detailing on the sides
5. It’s missing some major curves along the hull and top(outlined in red)
6. Ur bridge looks so fucking abysmal
7. No rudder and do we even need to talk about that propellor replacement
8. It can benefit greatly from motorlock since it looks like a sharp brick rn 
9. You didn’t even try to put windows
10. Missing anchors

TLDR shape is so fucking wrong, there’s 0 detail, you have such a stuck up attitude about a bad build

I’m expecting his next message to be some unde shit like “show me one of your builds”

creations-chat 2022-04-26 12:56:10 Don’t get high hopes now, once you add that extra weight things get weird

My pvp jet flew super stable when it was just the skeleton, then once you add extra weight you need to compensate for tail or nose weight ||or add a shit load of props and start pulling some ace combat shit||

Too much background and not enough on the jet
creations-chat 2022-04-28 21:49:23 Make the plane brighter compared to the background

The moon shouldn’t be the main focus

Try adding leading edges trails or wtvr it’s called

The white trails off the wing and the ones generated from pulling up real hard

<@883063424614006878> I will murder you if
creations-chat 2022-04-29 20:50:00 That isn’t noticeable enough and you need color variation/shading, that one solid red looks horrible

A large brain pcc member who takes feedback below, rare but welcome breed
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 20:53:47 The spirals are too far apart, in the real one there’s like 6 “layers” of expanding spirals near the tip while you only have 2 “layers”

<@592619320421384232> pretty cool ngl, the wall could use more decor like paintings but that might be somewhat painful to motorlock

Actually nvm the wall is fine

Maybe a table with flowers? Or a raised shelf mounted on the wall

Just looks a bit empty to me

creations-chat 2022-05-15 15:59:56 Horizontal stabilizers have too much angle and could u send a top down?

<@233666698715070465> don’t use rounded wings, very very few modern planes have curved wings and they both look ass

<@809781295500099584> why, it’s already a 3 wide

3 is already fat asf, and the body has 0 shape
creations-chat 2022-05-15 16:40:35 send a top down photo

wings r too skinny

help 2022-05-15 17:03:51 open close is what button you use to open and close trapdoor
lock is what button you use to lock the trapdoor
the toggle option is whether you want it to have the ability to lock or not
when its locked, it means other players cant open it by clicking

not even close to the biggest plane if you consider the one made by <@877391100137070625>
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:50:42 oh yea im making a 3rd pvp plane

the mig 25 was the first, didnt have supermaneuverability or m2m, adding bombs/any other payload besides rockets was a pain in the ass, i only use it for the 150 locked bombs i strapped to it since im too lazy to slap those on any other jet

The f-10 v1 is self explanatory, stupidly unstable, overmaneuverable to the point where you cant even hit a shot, didnt have m2m

F-10 V2 was pretty good, payload is easily swappable, pretty good maneuverability but a bit overkill, I modded it to have m2m but it wasnt designed for m2m so it doesnt work well over 600 sps
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 02:51:54 ngl this would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 03:04:23 Prolly not
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 03:04:38 I don’t usually make variants
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 03:04:51 Idk if the f-10 v2 can even be considered the same plane

plane-crazy 2022-05-19 03:06:43 V2 a

plane-crazy 2022-05-23 20:46:44 And nice high speed handling
plane-crazy 2022-05-23 20:46:51 Big body for more thrust

plane-crazy 2022-05-24 13:12:36 One block between

plane-crazy 2022-05-24 13:13:21 I think you could make 1.1x1.1 if you made it 6 or 7 long

creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:12:10 The f117 and the Gustav gun looking thing both deserve it ngl

F-117 could use some work on the nose but it looks good for an f-117

creations-chat 2022-05-28 18:18:33 bro ur so fucking dense, lego said they wouldnt make military sets, and no one gives a rats ass about brickmania using real legos, Im not gonna spent 7x the amount of money on a set that uses "real legos" when another company can make one equal to that of brickmania with comparable quality

the only times I would really pay extra just to get it from the official lego store is for more iconic sets like the typewriter or Titanic

oops, didnt realize how old the message was lmao, forgot to scroll
creations-chat 2022-05-28 19:51:43 I know, I saw it but decided if I’m gonna get one of the most iconic sets I might as well get the real thing

I got 2 and resold one for a 350$ profit lmfao

The other one is completed and sitting on the kitchen counter
creations-chat 2022-05-28 20:43:36 High demand, right when it came out the set was almost always out of stock in the Lego store and the website, saw people reselling for up to 1.2k bro
