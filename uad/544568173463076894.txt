plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:24:23 I have a suggestion add sticky blocks where when they touch another block they become stuck to each other (my idea with this is to make folds less glitchy)
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:33:16 Ok I did
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 21:38:55 What do magnets do?

plane-crazy 2021-03-24 01:01:12 FINALLY
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:13:07 is it considerd a "lag machine" cuz i have a rocket with about 5k blocks and it lags the server ALOT so is that allowed?

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:36:07 me Waiting for symetry tool
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:38:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:38:44 like if i had a bigger plot i would make a 10k block rocket lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:39:08 i would make big helium blocc

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:57:18 Yes...
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:57:33 People usually just go with whatever they see most ppl do lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:57:59 Then yes its what they think
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:22 Detail is hard to do on rockets lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:28 Like bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:34 Rockets arnet made for detail
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:41 They are made for what they need to do
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:47 Not *dEtAiL*
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:58:59 Thats the point
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:59:11 Its hard to make a rocket look perfect without making it look not like a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:59:36 Because i like rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:00:18 It aint easy to make a rocket look good without making it look like a un rocket
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:00:42 The only rocket that has “detail” and can have detail would be the saturn v
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:01:53 Deadass how tf did this get in there
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:02:22 Do you see a falcon 9 nope thats because they are rockets that are made for their pupose not to look good
