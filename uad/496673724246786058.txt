plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:56:51 10 hover thrusters helps, believe me.
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:57:55 yes
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:05:54 10 hover thrusters are better.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:17:38 For hover drive
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:20:14 But when you add blocks you can't reach top speed, so I tested with 8 and noticed it was "faster" then I put 10 and now I can reach top speed.
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 03:27:20 This is literally the <#384021699466756107>  chat and you are talking about portal for so long
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 03:27:47 Good game tho I have both
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:31:22 If your plane is big enough like mine (199 blocks, no motor lock) it can fit if you use that tail design that goes between the jet/rocket engines used for deco.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:34:23 2.5k speed?? How
Also is your IGN Vol_ante bc I think I was in a server with you.
creations-chat 2023-01-27 03:36:59 Ayy so it is you, but fr 2.5k speed is like.. idek its too fast. Also if the game uses knots as the unity of speed the 666 knots breaks the sound barrier

help 2023-02-10 04:10:39 put a sideways motor lock (2 motors) in the motor lock tower, then put a 1x0.9 block facing the tower, if all goes acording to plan the 1x0.9 block will fall on top the motor lock
help 2023-02-10 04:10:46 but I have to test that
help 2023-02-10 04:13:19 it works but then the sideways motor lock will stick out a little
creations-chat 2023-02-10 04:20:16 didnt think my joke build would get 7 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-02-10 04:37:30 learned the hard way
creations-chat 2023-02-10 04:41:11 but it actually reaches 300k speed
creations-chat 2023-02-10 04:54:32 it was made like years ago for the jokes, only now i updated it so it would fly off when i spawned it
creations-chat 2023-02-10 05:05:49 brrrrrrrrro, i cant have fun now?
