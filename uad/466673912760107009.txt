creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:30:46 bruh this is just argument about a blob " octohedron which cannot rotate and is omnidirectional.
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:33:21 but i have to tell you, maybe show a demostration of how it works or show some use to it. You could change the color to make it more clear i guess. Also the planecrazy upvote and downvote in creations are a bit picky in what genres they like.
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:36:06 ok then end of argument. Just remember that upvote and downvote dosent mean everything. Its what you think is good, no need to let people choose for you. You are the artist of your creations 😄
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:39:58 if the reaction is negative, then keep it to yourself
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:42:38 fine ima chill now this argument is going nowhere

creations-chat 2021-04-15 05:45:22 heres the design of the lockmotor/servo wing. Now can you tell me what could be causing the glitching. All it does is the servo turns it 90 degrees and then i lock it. But when i do that i causes it to glitch out.    (yes)   well no theres space for it  (ok tysm)
help 2021-04-15 07:40:57 you know you could just lockmotor the 6 other wheels to match the height of the wheel in the very front. Or you could add suspension on the 8 wheels.

creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:27:01 This is my bouncing bomb design and demonstration. To use this bouncing bomb, you must be low on the water and must be at a high speed. The videos below are the demonstration of the bombs in action and the design/build. You will also need a sight to line up with the target, which in included in the demonstration vid. If you have any questions ping me https://streamable.com/f0rtr1 https://streamable.com/dfd40o I suggest the bouncing bomb design with no cover, since it was more reliable in most of my tests
creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:35:54 alright then. but were am i gonna find a dam
creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:45:47 if your gonna make it, were gonna have to find a server together then or vip... ( you have pvp server right)
creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:48:27 wanna join mine then
creations-chat 2021-05-02 23:18:04 cant invite you, says it because of your privacy settings ok did it
creations-chat 2021-05-02 23:31:13 yes but I made the bombs as light, but packed with tnt as possible  just watch the design vid
creations-chat 2021-05-02 23:33:44 Yes but ballast tanks would cause the bombs to glitch out or cause them to slow down
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:19:59 Does anyone know how to solve this problem. So I have this working skip bomb that skips on water, but I want it to explode on impact. Now I have the 3 settings on, but when I arm the bomb on the water and let it skip, it explodes. If I just wait for the skipping bombs to hit its target and blow it up, the bombs dont explode on time. So how tnt settings should I make so that the bomb can skip on water without exploding, but explode on impact with the target?
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:23:13 so just on impact on the tnt settings  and nothing else?
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:25:22 ah man, thats a bummer ( but my bombs go super fast, while skipping
creations-chat 2021-05-03 05:45:37 ty i thought of the joke

help 2021-05-10 23:10:07 bro im using blocks
help 2021-05-10 23:10:35 I was talking about the curved bomb bay

help 2021-05-10 23:12:44 hey do you know how to make a curved bomb bay door?
help 2021-05-10 23:19:09 bruh IM USING ANGLE LOCKING AND NO ITS NOT JUST AS SIMPLE AS WEDGES
help 2021-05-10 23:19:58 Im having a real hard time figuring out how Im going to but any angle locking on a bomb bay door, without blocking the way for the bombs

help 2021-05-12 08:17:34 my bombs keep glitching into my plane
help 2021-05-12 08:19:17 Im making a flying fortress bomb configuration, the bombs are placed inside the bomber. but when I fly and drop bombs, they always glitch into the plane. I know I could just lock motor bombs and place it at the bottom of the bomber, but I want to keep the bombs inside the plane.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 08:21:37 Im making a flying fortress bomb configuration, the bombs are placed inside the bomber. but when I fly and drop bombs, they always glitch into the plane. The video below shows what happens inside of the bomber
bug-reports 2021-05-12 08:21:48 https://streamable.com/i97rqf
bug-reports 2021-05-12 16:41:06 Yes you told me to use lockmotor bombs and put it at the outside of the bomber, but I want to keep the same design of how to bombs are placed in the actual flying fortress
bug-reports 2021-05-12 16:42:13 I have no converyor engine or drive in my bomber
bug-reports 2021-05-12 16:42:51 remember the anti lag system rick put in place, ya.... it helped
bug-reports 2021-05-12 16:45:03 Well I just strapped some super rockets, and after the anti lag system rick put in place. I can now go instant acceleration. Before the anti lag system I didn't have this bomb problems.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 16:46:55 already tried that, but the bombs still glitch into the bomber.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 17:10:05 what, I do use bombs
bug-reports 2021-05-12 17:11:06 bruh you cant call a bomber a bomber without bombs
bug-reports 2021-05-12 17:13:09 thats because fighters can have missles and bombs, fireworks too
help 2021-05-12 22:40:07 Sadly you cant do anything about it. There reports on the discord server, but I think they shut it down. You could blacklist them or server hop.
help 2021-05-14 06:48:28 bro why is it not lowering (talking about the bomber not locking properly) I literally checked ever place for a block or wedge, but nothing. IM Losing my mind
help 2021-05-14 06:49:54 you new to server, plus there was no anchor blocks and I checked motor settings. Some block is stuck or something thats causing this to happen
bug-reports 2021-05-15 00:03:01 ok look im sorry, I understand that i should post a better question or explanation next time, please forgive and good day.
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:30:13 im guessing your a actual young 9 yearold, guessing because I was literally with you in the wind tunnel
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:30:55 you were with me in the wind tunnel channel
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:31:13 dude what was that coversation tho bro
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:31:23 its in voice channels
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:31:45 im not dumb, I was literally with you
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:32:08 bruh you coping people builds\
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:33:18 i saw the argument in creation feedback bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:34:05 i literally went back in the whole chat bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 02:36:39 ok then thank you for explaining, but dont go board with your conversations

creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:42:59 Im starting to do thick wing designs for my flying fortress, what you think? Also how could I impove on wing
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:46:42 Heres a different view of the green wing
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:51:47 heres the drawing i used
creations-chat 2021-05-16 04:04:54 im guessing you used angle locking and motor lock for this? (also that wing is too fin)
creations-chat 2021-05-16 16:28:22 Hey how do I do that 3 prop lock motor
creations-chat 2021-05-16 19:05:30 im sorry for asking, but does anyone know any good thick wing control surface designs?
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:25:32 just block him
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:32:12 Instead of arguing with you, im actually gonna help you this time. There are many tutorials that you can reference from or, you can use references in the plancrazy discord to learn the walking motion. For me I use helium to make the mech stand up and just make the walking animation from there with motors and motor locking. (look im not trying to mean, and I know that anyone can do this)
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:34:39 no problem
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:39:06 just don't mind chat, gets a bit crazy here sometimes. You just go to the search bar in the top right corner and search up the thing you want. That will show up many references you can use.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:42:05 well in my opinion I think a "no" wouldn't help his problem and insulting the guy for a skill issue is not smart. Just give him a straight responce
creations-chat 2021-05-16 20:59:11 I gave him some advice, to apoligize. It's better to apoloigize rather than just leaving it
help 2021-05-16 21:35:49 hey I was just wondering. How do I make 3 prop lock motor? I tried the ones yt but they suck
creations-chat 2021-05-16 21:38:47 bro stop bullying man aleady, the argument already died. He also already apoligized already through dm's
creations-chat 2021-05-16 22:22:10 maybe add some smoke, most ejection seats were propelled using a explosive charge under the seat. Plus that ejection seat mechnism is so good 10/10
creations-chat 2021-05-16 22:27:39 ask this man, he pro with this type of stuff <@!404632014189494293>

help 2021-05-17 20:15:37 So the main block holding the wing is the first block layer. Then I lock motor a wind pannel on top of that first layer. Then right on top of that wind pannel layer, I added a half block and half block down wedges for a round look

help 2021-05-17 20:22:32 any settings?
help 2021-05-17 20:26:11 dont give up man, decrease the torge and the speed a little. To much torge can cause the motor to lag

I don't want to make it hollow, since that will reduce the structural integrity of the rudder. That will make the rudder get torn off easy.

creations-chat 2021-05-22 17:32:50 how could I make this curved bomb bay door, I tried angle locking it with the bomb bay doors, but there wasnt any room for the tnt.
creations-chat 2021-05-22 17:41:16 I angle locked on the bomb bay door. I used disconnecters to hold the lock in place. Then I used a motor to make the angle. Then I disconnected and got the angle.
help 2021-05-22 18:30:32 probably try angle locking or motor lock
help 2021-05-22 21:46:14 couldn't just use half block thick wings to cover the motor lock. Or if its on the body. You can just motor lock some blocks or half blocks to cover the motor lock.
help 2021-05-22 21:47:45 show pic
help 2021-05-22 21:53:53 maybe change the plane design, no offense but that plane dosent look well at flying
help 2021-05-22 21:56:49 you could just put the in game tutorial on it, and make it look like a bi plane?

plane-crazy 2021-05-22 22:04:26 maybe another idea would be to increase the range of guns and fireworks

plane-crazy 2021-05-22 22:06:28 Im talking about high alititude planes, plus it was just a idea ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 22:07:15 Shredders can be avoided with a fast plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 22:08:21 maybe change plane design
creations-chat 2021-05-22 22:10:34 well my bombs are just 2 tnt together. The reason I keep it that way is because I want the radius large enough. Plus do you know how to solve this glitch?

bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:22:00 whats for you
bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:22:46 can you show pic of what you did

bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:23:10 ok
bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:31:38 uh so how am I going to pack alot of bombs in that
bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:32:09 oh ok
bug-reports 2021-05-26 00:42:59 I dont know man, my bombs are pretty tight together and the bomb bay pretty small. The other side of the bomb bay will also be filled with bombs that are tight too.
bug-reports 2021-05-29 20:24:01 This for all my builds, but the when I place a text sign and write a word in it. It censors. I'm not even writing anything inappropriate. This sign is suppose to say "berry."
bug-reports 2021-05-29 20:24:05 On the left side its fine, but always the right side theres a problem
bug-reports 2021-06-20 21:18:08 https://streamable.com/muc46y This keeps happening everytime I drop the bombs from the bomber. The bomb bay is sealed with blocks, which makes it so that the bombs wont escape. The bombs are racked on a wall with disconnectors and this wall is lock motored to the bomb bay. Sorry for the quality of the video.
bug-reports 2021-06-20 22:53:18 How should i place the bombs, outside of the plane? The bombers a b-24d btw
creations-chat 2021-06-21 03:39:14 thanks for insight, but it was really hard fitting the three blade mechanism in there, while at the same time fitting super rockets.
bug-reports 2021-06-21 06:14:42 https://streamable.com/yq46k1 I dont know why, but these tnt rockets just keep staying stuck in the air for no reason. Its not the suspension either.

help 2021-07-04 06:22:34 ok heres a question, say that you drop 150 tnt bombs from a alititude of 4200 in planecrazy. Each bomb is in pairs of 2 so 2 tnt make one bomb. Now the question I have is how much does it take for a bomb to fall from 4200 to the spawn base plates?
help 2021-07-04 06:26:18 wait did you actually tested
help 2021-07-04 06:26:33 or was that just a guess
help 2021-07-04 06:27:11 my computer pretty trash
help 2021-07-04 06:27:24 im trying to make a norden bombsight
help 2021-07-04 20:24:07 Anyone know how I can add a trim control surface to my elevator? Also how should I add one to my ailerons too?
help 2021-07-05 05:35:35 Well that guy that you talked to you about the arrow thing is mistaken. Go to settings and click the building arrow square, then it will say disabled and the build arrows will go away.
help 2021-07-05 05:38:05 Anyone know how to make a working trim on this elevator
help 2021-07-05 17:40:43 lock motor a half circle
help 2021-07-05 20:43:19 Does anyone know how to make a working control surface trim on a elevator?
help 2021-07-05 21:22:39 its still not possible
help 2021-07-06 04:49:30 hey do you know how to make working trim control surfaces for a elvator.
help 2021-07-06 04:57:05 These are the trims and I think you know where the elevator is. The trims are used to set the aircraft at a maintained altitude, or to stay at a certain altitude and not change in height what so ever.
help 2021-07-06 04:59:47 yes but its not like servos but motors. It can make your plane stay at a certain alititude and not change.
help 2021-07-06 05:01:32 not a automatic one, but like you use keys to change the up and down motion
help 2021-07-06 05:03:20 yes, but my problem is that even when I try to get the angle right, it keeps drifting up or down
help 2021-07-06 05:04:07 im talking about the bomber itself
help 2021-07-06 05:05:15 here let me show you what i have so far
help 2021-07-06 05:09:06 So this is my trim design, and sometimes when I move the trims, one of the white trim, is in the wrong direction than the other trim, so like a synchronization problem. Also when I use lock motor, when I attempt to move the trims they glitch out. Also theres again the problem that its hard to make the bomber stay in place
help 2021-07-06 05:10:12 ya but every situation is different, i need it to be somewhat adjustable
help 2021-07-06 05:11:13 ya i will try

help 2021-07-18 05:26:12 well most of the time they dont even give feedback instead giving mean comments or just telling the person to delete there build.
help 2021-07-18 05:27:56 well do you think a "skill issue" is a good response for feedback
help 2021-07-18 05:29:21 well ya but dont you think telling them what they could actually do

bug-reports 2021-07-29 18:24:05 because he probably just spawned at the airport, which if you use normal default mouse control surfaces, it glitches and makes the control surface broken.
bug-reports 2021-07-29 20:25:19 Dont spawn at airport when your using default control surfaces that are mouse controlled. It glitches the control surfaces, so maybe try custom control surfaces at airport or in general.

creations-chat 2022-07-05 01:17:27 I was wondering if you can show me how to build this sight design. I have figured out the accurate angles from 0-7200 altitude using motor 2. I'm using a fixed sight but I need stabilization.
bug-reports 2022-10-07 03:25:29 Delay, also plane crazy is a bit slow. Though I think its probably temporary?
creations-chat 2022-10-31 06:12:07 I'm not so good in the creation art detail. Maybe add some varying sizes of half balls on the walls. Try adding shadings, the wall of flesh is not fully one color.

creations-chat 2023-03-17 07:09:48 Sorry for asking a question for a long time ago build, but is it possible if you could show the how to build of the bombsight from different angles? The design of your bombsight is really brilliant, but the camera angle makes it a bit hard to see which parts go which. I hope your spring break goes well, ok bye now.
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:01:01 Sorry for asking a question for a long time ago build, but is it possible if you could still share the file of with the desmo math? These calculations are really brilliant for calculating the trajectory of a bomb in the game. I would like to test this in game, it's the vid wasn't able to show all the math. Thank you for responding and have a great day.
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:12:31 hi curby, it bulldogbrandon
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:13:55 you could use a combination of lock motor and angle locking
general 2023-04-22 17:10:46 yo does anyone remember the way to see plane crazy fps
