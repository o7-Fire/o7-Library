general 2021-11-12 16:09:11 Big question for pro builders
general 2021-11-12 16:09:31 My ship when I close it has some vibrations and idk how to resolve it
general 2021-11-12 16:09:41 yeah
general 2021-11-12 16:09:54 man
general 2021-11-12 16:10:07 alr tried it
general 2021-11-12 16:10:25 that's why I switched it with motor 2
general 2021-11-12 16:10:40 then the problem resolved but another one occured
general 2021-11-12 16:11:14 now the vibration aren't in the folding system but in the motors I put on my cannon and guns so when I close they vibrate
general 2021-11-12 16:12:11 how to get ship things pass

general 2021-11-12 16:13:19 f
general 2021-11-12 16:13:50 I also used magnets but even if they do resolve the problem they lag
general 2021-11-12 16:14:42 I'll try to switch with motor 1 again then
general 2021-11-12 16:15:53 can be servo and not depend on your mouse

creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:17:15 Yes some Italian regions do too, <@719168864705052802> there is no such French food that reached Pizza, the most famous types of pastas, Lasagne and ton of other foods, these foods are the most ate food in the world while who tf eats baguettes and chocolate isn't only yours come on, also don't say a few undreds different dishes because you make Italian cuisine feel big in comparision

general 2022-06-04 15:58:27 Yeah Italy took a lot of Ls, but I'm comparing Germany to French that's why I'm saying It took a lot of Ls, also Italian people are cowards? Learn history first, Italians changed sides because the entire population decided to kill their dictator and join the allies, "cowards" Frenchs surrendered in a blink of and eye

creations-chat 2022-06-25 05:50:53 Most? 15 percent of phones are waterproof
creations-chat 2022-06-25 05:58:05 Most? Only high-end phones are waterproof if you compare this number to the rest of medium end and low end phones you'll find that the majority isn't waterproof, especially if you take in consideration the most sold brand Xiaomi and other brands, Google phones aren't famous at all in fact they suck ass.

creations-chat 2022-06-29 15:26:25 üíÄAgain bruh I just told the A-10 was designed for ground support, It needs to be able to take hits

creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:07:19 Bro they kicked me out of the server because I was spawning my Eurofighter too much (kicked out due to client behaviour)

creations-chat 2022-07-16 16:52:15 Furry=no upvote<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 18:04:46 Bro can't talk backüíÄ
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:20:10 Tate said that if I don't do 500 push-ups in a day I'm mentally weak, tomorrow Is victory day
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:22:19 Yes
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:40:56 Let's keep the standard to have a shaped and healthy body high, now I'll do the second round
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:45:09 In general fat acceptance Is rising in this society full of comforts, people can sit behind a screen and say things they would never say face to face, in general having a good body is gradually becoming less useful in modern society which I found absurd, so let me go with a second round of push-ups
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:51:40 Yep <@706717603258957864> bro that's the Indian Fighter Typhoon from 7/11
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:55:11 That's pretty easy the difficult part Is to angle lock the back part which goes down and sideways at the same time, It took me two days of full work for that part
creations-chat 2022-07-16 22:57:13 People used to try to look good back then to fit in society, to work to have friends, now you can have "friends" behind a screen, work behind a screen that's what I mean for becoming less useful and idk if you have noticed how I am against everything that accepts being fat
creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:46:44 Americans thinking Germany is still a N*** country, Italy's population is part of mafia, est Europe=Soviet Union

creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:54:00 Bro being racist isn't just to skin colors, it's ethnicities, us Italians make fun of each other because we're so different
creations-chat 2022-07-17 07:58:59 You said the common phrase "Do you have anything against people who aren't american?" trying to make me sound racist, unfortunately you didn't know that I wasn't American either<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-07-17 08:04:53 You said "Any problems with being Latin American?" "I don't have to know English just because i'm on a server", you thought I was American or from the UK a native english speaker and that me saying you barely speak English to you was very offensive so you had to make me sound racist unfortunately I'm not a native English speaker too <@723940197456281640> Sorry where are you from?
creations-chat 2022-07-17 08:06:59 Yesüëç I thought you were American but then I read your English

general 2022-08-06 18:22:40 Alr
general 2022-08-06 18:26:47 The F35 Is a slow ass plane that relies on stealth technology too much, idk if It can hold the Aim-120C-8 but if It can't then its fodder, It can't provide a good enough Speed to shoot a mach 2 missile and It It can't hold the C-8 then It Will never have the range advantage against modern aircrafts, not only that, its manouvrability Is also poor compared to other aircrafts
general 2022-08-06 18:26:53 I drank some vodka
general 2022-08-06 18:26:59 Just the tip
general 2022-08-06 18:27:03 Will I get drunk?
general 2022-08-06 18:28:11 It does
general 2022-08-06 18:28:24 I've been told about aircrafts since I was 7 years old
general 2022-08-06 18:29:33 Yeah against a mig 29
general 2022-08-06 18:29:41 Not against a mig 31
general 2022-08-06 18:29:46 Not against a Eurofighter
general 2022-08-06 18:30:05 Stealth provides a lot of RCS reduction
general 2022-08-06 18:30:20 But you Will still get detected by a strong radar at 50 km
general 2022-08-06 18:30:29 Radar Cross Section
general 2022-08-06 18:30:48 Yeah strong radar big missiles go brrrr

general 2022-08-06 18:33:37 I think he's copypasting 10 websites down
general 2022-08-06 18:38:00 False stealth isn't invisibile a strong ground radar can easily detect an F35 at 60 or more km surely It helps a lot but it's not the Life saver once they shoot a missile at you, Manouvrability Is a must, manouvrability Is a lot, an F16 in the 1990s was able to deflect 6 missiles with its own manouvrability without the use of countermesures, the aim9x Is a close range IR missile It won't help you against a R74 Russian missile that has the same ability
Also did you know that from the F16 block 50 every American plane has a HMD that Is able to detect the enemy After lock off bore-sight, on the last point I can agree

general 2022-08-06 18:41:36 In what? BVR, Dogfight, Cas?
general 2022-08-06 18:46:18 BVR: F22, Eurofighter with Meteor missile, Russian planes like Su35 with axehead missiles could be 50/50, while planes like J-20 and Su-57 I can't really say, they're unknown to public and we don't know anything about them, so theorically the J-20 has range advantage while the su-57 Is still in testing and It needs a long range missile so the Su-57 isn't ready to go to battle
