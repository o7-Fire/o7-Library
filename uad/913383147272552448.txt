general 2023-07-09 23:32:51 I wish the move tool in plane crazy didn't move the whole build, but just chunks of it. That way, if you move the nose of An aircraft one block too close to the body, fixing it would be easy.
general 2023-07-09 23:33:08 Maybe in PC2?
general 2023-07-09 23:38:21 What do I do if I accidentally start a ticket for a rank at 00:30 GMT and can't close it?

general 2023-07-09 23:55:13 Dear moderators, 
Due to the late time, and my slow thinking, I accidentally opened a ticket for a new role. I am deeply sorry for my actions, and I hope that this formal apology is sufficient.
I shall have the necessary screenshots and brain power ready by tomorrow. Until then, I will remain quiet, so as not to make the same mistake twice.

Your humble servant,
McPenguin001ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

Other.

Make an option for the paint bucket, so that it only paints certain grouped together parts, and not the entire build. For example, you just disconnect your wing from the fuselage, use the bucket and only that wing gets painted because it's not attached to the fuselage.

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 14:04:17 Ok. I might still use angle lock because it's a small scale ship, and it already uses angle lock, and Rick still hasn't added 4x4 wedges.
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 14:04:30 So imma stick with angle-lock
bug-reports 2023-07-13 14:04:55 I don't anymore

general 2023-07-13 14:21:18 Because it's a Lenovo
general 2023-07-13 14:21:58 If I had apple laptop, they would just shut it down and tell me to buy a new one for 1 grand.
general 2023-07-13 14:22:10 So Lenovo is better.
general 2023-07-13 14:22:17 At least I can trust them
general 2023-07-13 14:22:29 I will soon
general 2023-07-13 14:22:36 But apple still expensive

help 2023-07-14 21:35:13 Do you have any tips to improve my ship, other than the things I listed in my previous message?
help 2023-07-14 21:36:27 I mean, I'm already gonna make the hull wider at the bottom for stability...
help 2023-07-14 21:36:50 I can't really make the superstructure bigger without messing up my angle lock...
help 2023-07-14 21:36:59 I could try lifeboats?...
help 2023-07-14 21:37:18 After angle locking the hull though, that's more important...
help 2023-07-14 21:37:36 And getting it higher above the waterline without it capsizing.
help 2023-07-14 21:38:05 I already fixed the lighting, but maybe I'll add cables holding up the funnels?....

plane-crazy 2023-07-14 21:44:52 I was thinking the third, but sure. Go for the first one.

creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:11:25 <@660019099430289418> thank you.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:14:33 What is wrong with it then? You could at least help me improve.
general 2023-07-16 10:16:41 Fine. I'll remove my creation because everyone is against it. Like, its my first ship. What did you's expect?!?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:18:03 I might as well remove it. What did people expect from my first ship? At least it moves, floats and is stable.

I'm taking it down to work on it then.
general 2023-07-16 10:20:15 I already took it down. But only to work on it with the help of the people in <#504436696021204992> .
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:22:26 Shut up. Nobody asked you. I'm just going to work on my ship and repost it then. Thank you, everyone in <#504436696021204992> (except <@984160483831590954> ). I'll be happy to use your help to improve.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:26:04 Thanks, SwagCat852. I'm just going to work on the boat and repost it, like I said. It only has to be good enough for me to get the shipwright (I) rank. It never says that to get it, the community has to like your ship.
general 2023-07-16 10:26:35 Shut up.
general 2023-07-16 10:26:48 I only took it down to work on it.
general 2023-07-16 10:33:51 Actually pretty good. Ignore these <@984993800864792586>holes in this channel.
general 2023-07-16 10:34:15 Oops. Accidental ping.
general 2023-07-16 10:34:26 How is $$ a name?!?
general 2023-07-16 10:34:48 Is that PC?
