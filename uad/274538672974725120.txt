general 2021-05-14 07:29:33 ah gaijin
general 2021-05-14 07:29:40 gotta love that meme
general 2021-05-14 14:45:57 i
general 2021-05-14 14:45:59 hi
general 2021-05-14 14:46:01 i am
general 2021-05-14 14:46:07 BUNNY
general 2021-06-10 09:27:03 eh
general 2021-06-10 09:27:12 find the ones that are good
general 2021-06-10 09:40:41 ughh can we do Voice chat?
general 2021-06-10 09:40:52 lets talk this on VC
general 2021-06-10 09:42:13 ughh fine
general 2022-07-23 17:10:56 eh, most of em you can beat. the rest dont use their heads much
general 2022-07-23 17:11:56 plus, plane crazy's majority of toxic users are the ones with Aircraft. whether it be the jets of the shredders
general 2022-07-23 17:12:38 they win because they exploit one important detail that plane crazy still hasnt countered yet
general 2022-07-23 17:14:29 depends on what platfom i make em for
general 2022-07-23 17:15:09 whether its for a game or a roblox game depends on the developer, otherwise its just someone who wants a prop
general 2022-07-23 17:15:23 as i was saying
general 2022-07-23 17:15:25 the weapons: the machine gun block and the rockets lack the speed and versatility
general 2022-07-23 17:16:19 the Developer needs to add a **new weapon** or a new **system** to counter or assist in countering aircraft
general 2022-07-23 17:16:40 otherwise a setup which makes it harder to be a fighter or a shredder
general 2022-07-23 17:17:08 PC is F2P
general 2022-07-23 17:17:15 wdym?
general 2022-07-23 17:17:31 clarify, no insults needed
general 2022-07-23 17:19:25 thanks for the clarification
general 2022-07-23 17:20:07 ohhhh you mean that game. okay now i get it
general 2022-07-23 17:20:46 anyways i said what i wanted to say regarding the toxic players on PC
general 2022-07-23 17:21:53 dont worry,  it doesnt always click in an instant
general 2022-07-23 17:22:37 happens all the time. im used to it
general 2022-07-23 17:23:31 mature?
general 2022-07-23 17:24:29 you said how i am, then you say i AM mature
general 2022-07-23 17:26:04 we both know the server makeup is mostly noobs.
general 2022-07-23 17:29:19 from my experiance, most toxic players on PC are immature. they use insults. most of the time, they fight those that irritate them verbally. Toxic players normally have an ego, coming from their building prowess
general 2022-07-23 17:30:12 in actuality, its because noone on the ground can HIT an aircraft, most toxic players use aircraft, that includes shredders
general 2022-07-23 17:31:01 not many players know about them or have built one
general 2022-07-23 17:31:14 meaning fewer servers have a player with one
general 2022-07-23 17:33:00 from my experiance, the best way to take an aircraft out is to build a BIG glass cage with a flamethrowers x2 burning the craft
general 2022-07-23 17:34:18 glass, as in the material for the block, also because many aircraft users have a harder time seeing it because they hit it
general 2022-07-23 17:34:57 you take mobility away from an aircraft then its just a fragile design with rockets pointing forward
general 2022-07-23 17:36:30 ive seen this build in a server. so its called a magnet cannon?
general 2022-07-23 17:41:14 i disagree with its effectiveness, its an inaccurate single shot design
general 2022-07-23 17:42:38 its range is adequate, its firing velocity is adequate. its spread is a bonus
general 2022-07-23 17:43:32 but a wobbly single shot design is not convincing
general 2022-07-23 17:44:46 go ahead, perhaps i can add it to my inventory some time. but it still doesnt solve the problem completly
general 2022-07-23 17:45:05 i bet even the Dev knows how OP aircraft are
general 2022-07-23 17:52:19 the shotgun AA tank though using a signle shot design is much more effective
general 2022-07-23 17:53:43 the missile launcher truck also appears to be an effective design, having multishot, firing homo missiles could counter your average aircraft, not shure about the faster ones
general 2022-07-23 18:02:07 thats not pee
general 2022-07-23 18:02:20 thats the fat from bacon after getting roasted
general 2022-07-23 18:03:45 a new low for bacons? find out now by just looking!
general 2022-07-23 18:20:56 mmmm, just jump on the fryin pan bacon, as its your destiny
