plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:26:01 damn it!
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:26:33 You want it to be smoother?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:36:16 
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:36:40 How about his?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:36:43 this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:37:12 Making planes sure is hard
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:37:31 The bottom?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:37:35 too boxy?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:38:57 But I should try harder
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:39:00 Not give up
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:40:03 Isn't A320 has a quite big nose?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:42:15 So the nose has some problem?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:47:03 
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:48:50 which part?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:49:22 how
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:49:30 How to make it rounder?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 07:50:02 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:10:52 
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:11:23 Is it rounded enough?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:12:25 **fucking magnets how does it work**
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:13:34 Other than the nose cone, where can I improve?

plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:28:15 Who hate Vsauce shifted his focus to D!ng?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:28:23 I think his new video is not as deep as the old ones
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:28:33 I miss the old Vsauce video
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:28:36 It has depth to it
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:29:20 It is just the Micheal Shopping Channel that sells math and brain game stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:29:52 Remember when VSauce could give you existential crisis?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:30:17 It was mysterious yet fasinating
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:30:23 Now it is just too childish
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:30:33 VSauce was unique back then
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:30:44 None other channel is as woke as him
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 08:30:57 Don't build like that?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:14:53 So far so good!
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:15:22 I am building
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:15:30 Not yet
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:15:38 Now time to build the second wing
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:15:58 Curiosity gnome'd the cat
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:16:41 Why do people use Delta Wings, It is just a fancier term for triangle wings
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:17:05 yea
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:17:33 This community is pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:17:36 got dank memes
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:43:29 Any ways to build the plane engine?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:43:34 Any ideas?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:46:55 How should I build engines that look good?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:47:28 Can I use the design?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:48:27 We need to make our own jet engines is because the vanilla jet engines sucks so much
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:48:44 It is a propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:12 Is the motor a decoration?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:21 I mean the model engine
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:33 Propellar !?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:36 How does it work?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:49 It works functionally?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:49:58 I though you just stick a rocket a boom
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:50:09 Can you show the interior of the engine?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:50:20 So I can add the motor stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:52:57 How?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:53:21 kk
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 10:54:08 done

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:58:02 Does this plane sucks?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:58:10 I hope not since I work my asses off with the head
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:58:44 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:59:02 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:59:36 Only the nose?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 07:59:44 Why do planes look normal at side by not infront?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:00:56 This plane is to test the how to use the motor
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:01:02 So I think this plane is just a test
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:01:21 I am going to build the DC-3
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:01:46 The front ruins everything
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:01:51 Any tips for building?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:03:07 Best way to make myself to feel disappointed is to upload my creations here!
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:24:37 Will I improve if I keep building
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:24:40 I need some rest
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:24:41 seriously
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 08:25:57 I am getting desperate right now
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:10:18 simple but cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:41:42 i think Plane crazy is missing some part
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:41:57 We need the 1xnxn right pryamid
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:42:01 but with 1x1 as the base
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:42:14 The current corner wedge only have 1x4 base right pyramid
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:43:50 We need the enlongated of that corner wedge
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:44:33 I just need that right pyramids to stop my creations look shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:44:41 those*
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:44:58 ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:46:08 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:47:36 Where to suggest that part?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:47:40 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:48:03 You need rank or somethign right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:48:10 wut rank?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:48:37 I have submitted a plane for engineer rank but no pople responded
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 09:49:00 <@456226577798135808> check your privilleage x1000

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 10:30:35 I will add it later
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:16:12 A learjet
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:36:40 Who thinsk jet engine are too weak?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:36:53 huh
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:37:01 How to maximize the thrust of jet engines?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:38:09 or is it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:38:11 These two engines are too weak]
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:39:19 Any problems with this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 11:40:01 magnet drives?
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 07:21:14 This is weird
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 07:27:10 I should go play KSP instead
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 07:27:12 It is more fun
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 07:29:35 I don't get why elon got so much praise
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 07:51:03 If madattak make a spinoff of the KSP, I will absolutely play it
general 2019-06-26 07:07:35 What should I do in KSP?
general 2019-06-26 07:07:38 Gimme some project ideas
general 2019-06-26 07:09:37 Anymore details?
general 2019-06-26 07:09:54 Like setting up a Jool station first then other planetary base
general 2019-06-26 07:10:17 Does mods = cheating?
general 2019-06-26 07:10:55 My level is to do a Duna mission with minimum fuck up
general 2019-06-26 07:11:05 I can do the Kerbin moons without cheating
general 2019-06-26 07:11:43 I should start off my sandbox save by colonizing the Jool
general 2019-06-26 07:12:19 I always procastinate ksp
general 2019-06-26 07:12:26 I need some motivation
general 2019-06-26 07:12:34 I did science and career
general 2019-06-26 07:13:09 I made some
general 2019-06-26 07:13:14 but rarely use it
general 2019-06-26 07:13:36 It has the capability of having 4000 dv when orbit
general 2019-06-26 07:13:43 Regular small sstos
general 2019-06-26 07:13:55 But when you get more than 40 tons
general 2019-06-26 07:14:00 stuff are getting messy
general 2019-06-26 07:14:14 Any tips for big SSTOs
general 2019-06-26 07:14:35 2 rapiers and 2 nuke configurations are the best I can get
general 2019-06-26 07:15:13 I think I often expect too much with SSTOS
general 2019-06-26 07:15:26 my mind is having a 6000 m/s dv ssto without refueling
general 2019-06-26 07:15:29 with mk2
general 2019-06-26 07:16:21 I hate doing contracts
general 2019-06-26 07:16:45 When you need to wrap your head around planning the mission
general 2019-06-26 07:16:54 Thinking how to squeeze the most out of the least funds
general 2019-06-26 07:17:01 Then you will get demotivated
general 2019-06-26 07:17:47 When you see those big KSP youtubers doing insane efficient stuff
general 2019-06-26 07:18:56 Who else don't want to use the 4 kerbals because they might die?
general 2019-06-26 07:19:31 It is cruel to give you the same 4 starter kerbals
general 2019-06-26 07:19:37 It made me attached to them
general 2019-06-26 07:19:43 Use hyperedit
general 2019-06-26 07:19:47 And do ship landing
general 2019-06-26 07:19:48 done
general 2019-06-26 07:20:47 #OptimizationIsForNerds
general 2019-06-26 07:21:22 btw, I think KSP has made me more interested in Physics and science
general 2019-06-26 07:21:43 DUH
general 2019-06-26 07:21:47 **DUHH**
general 2019-06-26 07:22:07 Simplerockets suck balls
general 2019-06-26 07:22:13 It is plain and boring
general 2019-06-26 07:22:29 k
general 2019-06-26 07:22:54 Work at NASA you nerd
general 2019-06-26 07:23:07 I got it in the sale
general 2019-06-26 07:23:55 Any ways to motivate me to do more missions in KSP?
general 2019-06-26 07:24:12 Small SSTO is easy to make
general 2019-06-26 07:24:23 I still need to learn how to do mk3 big SSTOs
general 2019-06-26 07:25:06 I need a cargo SSTO
general 2019-06-26 07:26:59 Orangeskii, how's your KSP skills
general 2019-06-26 07:27:56 Reusability is another big pile of spaget to plan
general 2019-06-26 07:28:51 I should go design an orbital cargo SSTO mk3
general 2019-06-26 07:28:57 any engine config suggestions?
general 2019-06-26 07:29:46 What kind of engines do I need for Mk3 cargos?
general 2019-06-26 07:29:51 Rapier or Rapier + nukes
general 2019-06-26 07:30:06 Nukes arent appealing at large SSTO
general 2019-06-26 07:30:17 LKO?
general 2019-06-26 07:30:23 Whiplash + NUkes?
general 2019-06-26 07:30:30 or Rapier (Air) + nuke?
general 2019-06-26 07:31:20 When you don't know the optimal ascent profile, I shoot at 10 degrees
general 2019-06-26 07:31:56 I dont do that
general 2019-06-26 07:32:02 30-35 = instant suicide
general 2019-06-26 07:34:14 For most SSTOs, there are stages
Gaining Speed for mach 1 (Optional) -> Climb -> duck down for thrust -> climb again or prograde burn
general 2019-06-26 07:35:21 Your goals is to shoot for the most speed from the airbreathers
general 2019-06-26 07:35:35 So more fire the better
general 2019-06-26 07:36:17 Rule of thumb, burning like hell = optimal
general 2019-06-26 07:36:43 What capacity should I aim for when I build my first mk3 ssto cargo?
general 2019-06-26 07:36:47 how many tons?
general 2019-06-26 07:37:31 I'll do a 25 tons then
general 2019-06-26 07:39:27 Chill out dude
general 2019-06-26 07:39:30 I'll delete them
general 2019-06-26 08:52:20 <@163143541160148992> What is the ascent profile of your cargo SSTO?
general 2019-06-27 06:02:10 Flying a mk3 cargo ssto lag my pc to death(almost but quite) any tips to improve performances
general 2019-06-27 08:20:10 Time to test the SSTO
general 2019-06-27 08:21:49 Front pilot seats are not edgy enough
general 2019-06-27 08:21:56 Lets put it at the back
general 2019-06-27 08:23:42 but it looks cool
general 2019-06-27 08:34:09 
general 2019-06-27 08:34:15 Need some electrocharge and some sas or rcs
general 2019-06-27 08:34:26 Also you got a sick front cargo door
general 2019-06-27 10:51:59 nvm
general 2019-06-27 10:52:03 The cargo door is too draggy
general 2019-06-28 10:39:12 I have finally developed my own Mk3 cargo SSTO and sucessfully tested
general 2019-06-28 10:39:49 The NeoHexo-1
general 2019-06-28 10:39:54 Also funky landing
general 2019-06-28 10:40:35 
general 2019-06-28 10:41:16 This ssto got a distinctive hexagonal engine placing
general 2019-06-28 10:41:34 
general 2019-06-28 10:41:50 chonk?
general 2019-06-28 10:42:40 Why bother sticking and aligning a ton of engines and fuselage when you can bundle them in to two fat cylinders?
general 2019-06-28 10:43:56 I thought you were joking
general 2019-06-28 10:44:11 nvm
general 2019-06-28 10:44:59 It can get up to 50 tons
general 2019-06-28 10:46:23 So am I wasteful with the fuel?
general 2019-06-28 10:47:14 Now with my own Mk3, I can finally start building my space station
general 2019-06-28 10:48:37 That was my first sucessful Mk3 ssto cargo
general 2019-06-28 10:48:42 other ehh
general 2019-06-28 10:49:53 The skill levels of KSP players are wide-range
general 2019-06-28 10:50:42 There are some people that do insane stunts and build colossal stuff while others barely goes to the mun
general 2019-06-28 10:51:43 Let's start to plan my space station
general 2019-06-28 10:52:38 *When you get centrifuges and other spinning stuctures, other people will think you are cool*
general 2019-06-28 10:53:15 To KSP youtuber logic
general 2019-06-28 10:53:37 More silly unnecessary stuff the better

general 2019-06-28 13:06:09 Like minmus
general 2019-06-30 14:31:22 The cognitive dissonance of this comment is high for me
general 2019-06-30 14:32:16 Personally, I don't care what the policy shit is about, I just use a patch to disable the RedShell.dll . It is sad to say there is no game that is as fun and as entertaining than KSP, so I still buy and play it.
general 2019-06-30 14:33:06 The comments of this comment makes me want to punch someone
general 2019-06-30 14:34:01 I think the game is one thing and the privacy stuff is the another thing
general 2019-06-30 14:35:12 I need someone to relieve the cringe or the dissonance of this problem and I need to deal with the grief
general 2019-06-30 14:37:40 This makes me angry somehow, maybe I am biased
general 2019-07-01 00:10:19 These are my mods
general 2019-07-01 00:10:25 I tried to use as least as possible
general 2019-07-02 10:03:20 Prepare to land after a mission
general 2019-07-02 10:07:43 That was a beautiful view
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 07:53:58 Is this a good idea for a computer build?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 13:51:37 How to choose a computer:
Choose CPUs/GPUs with many letters with it
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 13:51:49 More weird letters the better
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 13:52:03 X,K and stuff
general 2019-07-08 07:15:40 My Jetliner
general 2019-07-08 07:16:11 This plane looks quite like in the 80s-90s
general 2019-07-08 07:16:52 It works
general 2019-07-08 07:17:04 This cruises at 220 m/s
general 2019-07-08 07:17:17 What considers fast?
general 2019-07-08 07:17:30 atleast mach 1?
general 2019-07-08 07:28:06 Shut up, I spent time building that plane
general 2019-07-08 07:29:02 heck
general 2019-07-08 07:30:41 very funny ha ha
creations-chat 2019-07-15 04:28:32 So bored so I built the arrow on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:36:55 Any alternatives for that block?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:37:03 The 1x2 corner wedge with 1x1 base?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:54:28 With 1x1 base?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:54:53 No it is not the same
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:56:30 You mean this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:56:45 It is different from that
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:57:02 try fit it
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:57:10 fit that corner
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:57:48 Any alternatives for that?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:58:00 There are so many missing wedges
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:58:27 also don't you hate the naming schemes of blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:58:34 there are two half wedges
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:59:00 Also the half wedge in half blocks only work in certain direction
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 04:59:37 There should be Half wedge (Inner) and Half wedge (Outer)
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 05:00:31 Don't you hate when you are able to make it smooth but you can't find the perfect block
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 05:02:10 Or build smol
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:28:36 Binary adder is AndXor
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:28:42 Since it would give the AndXor
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:29:31 Binary adder is a trope for a computer in (insert video game that has mechanism)
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:29:47 They think binary adders are computers smh
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:30:13 Half adder is literally two inputs that hook up to a And gate and a Xor gate
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:30:25 And gate for the 10
Xor gate for the 01
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:31:22 Domino computer = binary adder
Marble computer = binary adder
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:31:31 Once you can do And and Xor gates, you can do calculations
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:36:39 cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:36:54 Lemme try to
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:36:55 too
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:37:31 you don't need not gate
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:37:58 A binary adder only needs and xor or
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:38:09 The three horseman of computing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 08:38:13 logic
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 08:29:11 make this a meme
the-dump 2019-07-25 08:32:11 you can add it to any meme
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 05:33:54 Wow very cool mac
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 05:34:07 Classic macbook
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:16:16 Who has the mental capacity to read a book that takes more than a day to finish? I surely can't
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:18:51 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:19:07 Books are for nerds
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:22:07 I can't derive happiness from books
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:22:58 Schools think books are like the holy grail
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:09 Or like jake paul say it, a god church
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:51 They think nothing can replace books
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:24:31 It is like saying using horses is the most superior way of transport
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:25:41 even minecraft tutorials have higher knownledge density

general 2019-08-19 05:20:34 Have you played ksp and too lazy to do the delta-v requirement calculations and just go with it
general 2019-08-19 05:21:31 Do you memerize the delta v map?
general 2019-08-19 05:21:38 memorize
general 2019-08-19 05:21:50 Then sing it out
general 2019-08-19 05:22:06 how much can you memorize?
general 2019-08-19 05:22:11 I know 3200 for orbit
general 2019-08-19 05:22:46 Let me make a rhyme for it
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:20:50 
bot-central 2019-08-19 10:33:29 &help
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:53:40 I think this has been request for so many times
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:54:27 Notice a pattern in that picture?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:54:40 Those parts are missing
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:55:28 I should find more missing parts
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:55:41 btw, that picture is elegant than saying corner wedge...
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:57:41 i think length 4 is ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:58:57 Those missing corner wedges make some planes impossible to build
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 10:59:07 It is impossible to build smooth slant cones with them
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:00:00 Also the parts have poor naming
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:00:08 Half Wedges and Half Wedges
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:00:56 Need a more systematic naming
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:01:15 Like Corner Wedge 1x4x1, Corner Wedge 4x1x1
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:01:35 Or they can use pictures
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:02:29 Corner Wedge 1x1 base with 2 height = Corner Wedge 1x1x2h
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:03:14 I think the better naming would solve the issues
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:03:36 The names of part should have 3 dimensions
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:03:41 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:04:06 BYM?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:04:41 What is BYM?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:05:06 oh that one
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:05:17 The save feature protocol is pretty limiting
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:05:43 If parts need more customization, new save and load protocol and format have to be introduced
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:06:07 One block in one 1x1x1 cell
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:06:28 ~~Some games could handle this better~~
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:08:02 Too cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:08:08 2cool2team
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:08:57 Sometime when you build something in Plane Crazy and realized there is a part that should have been there but it doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:09:14 The plane ended up looking rough
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:09:19 bruh moments
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:09:36 It still looks sucks
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:10:11 That's why it is infuriating at some times
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:10:53 I prefer to build stuff in 1:1 scale
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:11:03 But it is limited by the incomplete part list
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:11:08 oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:11:45 Yea
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:11:53 And it has higher risk of not flying
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:12:35 Replicated something and the CoM and CoL is not balancing
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:12:46 But it looks bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:13:04 Yeah I tried
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:13:16 Putting SUPAH ROCKET ENGINES
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:13:58 Somebody should have given those wedges already
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:14:43 The current building set is good for building fighter jets as the front of the planes are right conical shape and not slanted conical shape
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:15:07 In commercial aviation, slanted conical shaped cockpit is more oftenly used
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:15:42 ?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:16:04 also, the tiny wedges should have in and out versions
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:16:31 
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:21:35 Hope to see those new wedges coming
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:21:54 Run run
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:22:06 Also my username has updated

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:25:46 lets not talk about that
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 11:28:34 The half wedge 2 name makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 14:55:24 A work in progress Claw machine
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 14:56:20 Is that ok?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 14:56:24 I like that mechanism
general 2019-08-19 22:49:00 ksp 2 sounds like it would kill simple rockets 2 before it actually launches

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:35:56 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:36:23 By inventing, it means innovative mechanism in games?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:36:58 oh that kind of inventing
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:38:44 I don't think realistic is the definition here
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:38:52 maybe some awesome mechanisms
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:39:05 I think mine is not epic enough
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 10:39:13 ?

general 2019-08-26 06:33:55 I am still procrasting my career save
general 2019-08-26 06:34:47 at the point I think ksp2 is just a more optismized ksp
general 2019-08-26 06:35:00 There are nothing much to add on KSP that mods can't do it
general 2019-08-26 06:35:30 Yea, like the sernedo GTA 6 bullshit
general 2019-08-26 06:35:43 It is just GTA 5 with mods
general 2019-08-26 06:36:35 ksp2 will either look like modded ksp1 or regular ksp with better graphics and performance
