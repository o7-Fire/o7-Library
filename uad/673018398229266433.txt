plane-crazy 2021-02-11 03:46:41 does anyone have a fix where helis are pitching up and down while moving forward?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 03:47:50 so for example
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 03:49:03 when I try to gain altitude, my helo sort of tilts forward and backward by a few degrees
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 03:49:34 I canâ€™t get my helicopter to stay still
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 03:57:01 nvm, fixed. just had to lower main rotor speed

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:39:30 im making a spaceship w/ grav slider and when i test it it spins without me controlling it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:40:44 for previous spaceships it hasnâ€™t done this but it has with my own version of a federal corvette
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:04 can someone help
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:24 so
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:31 i have a ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:42 the ship turns without input
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:12 also i dont use gravity, its spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:56 does mass apply when thereâ€™s no gravity?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:59 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:53:29 i have a set of wings on both ends of le ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:53:43 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:53:51 yep
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:55:06 so
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:55:22 i have two sets of wings equally elevated on both sides of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:55:51 three vertical 4x1 and three horizontal 4x1
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:06 they are motorlocked together for both sides
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:32 wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:34 so
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:42 also
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:03 It doesnâ€™t push down or up or anything, it violently turns left.
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:11 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:59:03 X axis, like a violent left yaw turn
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:59:21 and then followed by a roll and a slower pitch up
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:12 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:14 this is what the wings look like, it is propelled by thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:41 the wings are on the bottom of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:46 also
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:05 yeah super rocket thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:09 thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:17 i think so
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:20 i dont know
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:45 so both wings are equal in elevation on the build
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:04:16 this is what im making but a bit smoother and very much smaller
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:05:23
