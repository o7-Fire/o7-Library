general 2020-03-28 10:49:35 I dont have rank so i cant suggest, but what do you guys think to add something like jukeboxes, i think it can be cool.

It will be possible to turn on quiet music on fishing boat.

Or make announcements on huge spaceships.

Add epic cannon sounds on tanks or battleships.

And lots of other cool things.

If someone abusing jukeboxes there can be option in settings to mute jukeboxes from one player creation, or all of them.
