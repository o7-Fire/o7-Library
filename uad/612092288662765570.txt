general 2022-05-03 01:12:26 "bro" damn didnt know it was a red flag
general 2022-05-22 03:09:08 so you can sit in more then one seat and still control
general 2022-05-22 03:10:32 Other people can sit in it but cannot control anything, main seat is just for spawning and controlling, copilot seat is so you can control multiple builds independently, or to control one build from a few different places.
general 2022-05-22 03:13:14 good luck
bug-reports 2022-05-23 21:50:35 anyone elses plane just suddenly lose all thrust and lift and fall into the void?!!??!

creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:54:44 damn cant make a joke around here eh? gj moment
creations-chat 2022-05-24 21:57:47 Sorry for doing my best I'll go die next time
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:01:01 Thanks for the criticism and ability to take a joke, and thanks for not being a jerk, because that is 100% not something you were. Man I sure love when people are supportive and helpful!
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:07:02 Damn I love when people think that jokes have to be funny or else they aren't jokes, not every joke is intended to be funny, and no one cares that you think a build is bad, because the only thing you are doing in creations chat is being rude to people who you think you are superior to because you can build better in a videogame then them, so instead of being supportive and pointing out flaws you put people down and call them stupid. This also goes for gj, as instead of contributing to the community, you take away from it.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:09:31 Is that a good thing or? damn
bug-reports 2022-05-24 22:29:08 make a math channel

general 2022-05-24 22:33:48 dont argue
general 2022-05-24 22:37:33 That was such a strong argument it caused my power to go out.
general 2022-05-24 22:40:41 baseball sized hail mixed with a dust storm
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:47:49 U are my therapist now!
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:49:57 Dang
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:53:16 Yeah man only when people are correct do they not have fathers.
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:55:53 Did I ask if you said if I was correct or if I was wrong?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 22:58:01 No actual argument?
bug-reports 2022-05-25 13:54:52 that is so extremely helpful
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 13:31:42 that intake looking like a 3 year old made it
general 2022-06-07 16:00:15 ok humans when a piston is destroyed does your game freeze and your pc go to the temperature of the sun?
bug-reports 2022-06-07 16:03:34 Anyone else's game freeze whenever a piston is destroyed/damaged?
bug-reports 2022-06-07 16:13:17 sadly that applies to 99% of things good for detail
bug-reports 2022-06-08 03:08:30 not a glitch thats just called lag
bug-reports 2022-06-08 03:10:34 Sometimes when I ragdoll I'll get teleported around the map randomly, usually ending in getting flung into the void
bug-reports 2022-06-08 03:19:12 You're welcome to disagree, but if you don't care what explanation is given, why are you here?
bug-reports 2022-06-08 03:20:36 Seems like lag to me.
bug-reports 2022-06-18 20:07:19 after a full year, my missiles appear to be back
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:01:23 big improvement over the previous at-at design, definitely less top heavy and much more manoeuvrable
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:04:38 the face non white names make waiting for cooldown to end after seeing one speak
general 2022-07-03 04:16:45 how fast do shredders normally go?
general 2022-07-03 04:16:59 as in top speed
general 2022-07-03 04:17:17 pardon?
general 2022-07-03 04:17:38 i didnt ask for your age
general 2022-07-03 04:17:57 dont have one sorry
creations-chat 2022-07-27 20:48:55 <@673696302621655061>the spine should stop before it reaches the start of the engines, also it should be angled towards the rear of the jet not flat
creations-chat 2022-07-27 20:53:13 <@673696302621655061> also can you post more pictures of it at different angles in here?
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:02:56 for fear of death
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:07:35 If you use piston lock you can get them centered, also your wings shouldn't be at a 22.5 degree angle, but instead at a 45 degree angle, which you can easily get with a 1x1 delta wing
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:22:06 wth is the "circle" on the far left for
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:24:16 its the elevator not a missing panel
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:26:19 <@673696302621655061> i think most of the issues with your f-15 could be solved if you used overlay
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:29:12 why would you use overlay? 💀💀💀
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:31:40 nice @ and i mean this "Now why would you do that"
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:34:09 you answered your own question, nice
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:36:13 your fault for not being specific
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:38:31 c o n t e x t just so happens to be a thing and it would line up with what either of us said, maybe they shouldve used the reply button
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:42:11 it was one away so mine was also "right there" and we both sent them at nearly the same time
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:45:19 they were posted seconds apart and anyways there was no reason not to use reply
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:48:07 i dont think that was nescessary
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:51:22 u drink it?
creations-chat 2022-07-27 21:54:35 reasonable
creations-chat 2023-01-14 00:51:29 I could use some feedback on my F-16, especially the tail cause it feels like the scale is off to me but I might just be trippin.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 00:54:36 Any idea how I could fix it? Not to be a bother.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 01:01:10 Do you think it is worth the effort to do a custom angle for it?
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:13:06 If you mean the pylons then yes, I put some on, I plan on adding more since I'm still not finished with the jet. Also this isn't an updated screenshot.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:15:13 F-18.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 05:20:21 I would rather die than keep working tonight. I'll keep it in mind though.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 20:59:14 bruh you can see that in the first pic 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-14 21:01:18 Fine, give me a few minutes and I'll send a screenshot.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 21:08:02 
creations-chat 2023-01-14 22:13:20 
creations-chat 2023-01-14 22:17:11 Thoughts on the tail? I changed it from 1x2 to 1x1 , and made it shorter.
bot-central 2023-01-14 22:44:21 !rank
creations-chat 2023-01-14 22:53:13 Paint it and show images that expose less of the parts you can't hide.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:10:35 Did you take a picture of your screen?
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:15:14 rip
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:38:54 
creations-chat 2023-01-14 23:59:50 wow hacker!!!
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:01:51 <@728634077036413049> You sweet summer child.

general 2023-01-15 00:17:07 <#925563336500871268>
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:21:20 No feedback?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:24:30 Thanks, but do you have anything specific to improve or do you just mean in general?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:36:16 Should I repost or just edit new pictures.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:39:36 It's nice and all but the nose is round not rounded square.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:43:36 That is nice and all but how do you think I should improve those parts?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 00:48:13 Definitely agree on the canopy-fuselage transition. And by making the fuselage wider do you mean the wing-fuselage transition? Yee that is what I meant, I'll start working on that.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:05:51 Something like this? Not a final version ofc.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:11:12 Probably sleep on it, I thought of a way to fix my exposed motor lock in the middle of class.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:47:40 🔫
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:50:46 Yowch.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:57:25 Since when was 3 months a long time, I don't think bringing up his builds is a good argument because he can still point out that it has flaws.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:59:28 Someone needs a reference image. 💀🔫
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:06:03 Bro did the bot delete my message because it contained "jerk"
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:08:12 That pumpkin cannot compete with my grandpa.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:10:18 naw he died of lung cancer :)
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:12:23 💀🚬 naw he ded as an oil deposit
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:14:24 Average twitter user offended for someone else.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:17:00 it would be funny if you stopped using twitter
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:25:06 this is so easy to fix my boi also why did you build it like that in the first place did you not use a reference image?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:27:57 how did you look at the spine being literally at the same height as the cockpit and think that going down an entire block was the right course of action
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:30:01 way better than the last image
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:32:16 
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:34:36 destroy the atmosphere
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:39:53 touch it all over it looks really good... uh phrasing
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:43:16 why did you destroy it

rip
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:45:30 What is it based on?

ship good very yay
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:48:54 o-o
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:51:35 even better idea make literally anything other than a 1x1 prop jet because you are clearly not able to hide motor lock at that scale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 21:29:54 New vs. old 
imma probly change the angle or height of it at some point though
creations-chat 2023-01-15 21:35:31 
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:49:58 goofy ahh spring bruh
general 2023-01-17 01:46:37 wait till people turn trans-racial

creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:53:17 Are you implying something about the nose?
creations-chat 2023-01-18 23:55:35 
creations-chat 2023-01-19 00:03:22 
creations-chat 2023-01-19 00:43:23 like a 1x1 delta in the corner?
creations-chat 2023-01-19 01:37:00 frfr
creations-chat 2023-01-21 23:51:30 s u g g e s t i o n s ?
creations-chat 2023-01-22 00:21:33 yeah yeah i know but like, H O W
creations-chat 2023-01-22 00:24:02 if that tiny angle is a 1x1 delta then the elevator is 8 blocks long 💀
creations-chat 2023-01-22 00:26:04 The scale just wouldn't be accurate to the size of the elevators.
creations-chat 2023-01-22 00:38:41 D:
creations-chat 2023-01-22 01:07:02 send a video
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:24:49 ok left or right elevator cause yall want me to make it more rounded even though it makes no sense at this scale so which side looks better
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:27:25 how many blocks is the elevator in this image
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:36:36 rip scale i guess but fine
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:38:53 main wing?
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:41:13 dang bro i didnt think you would notice the 5 degree difference
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:50:16 ok but like... that would just mean making the wings smaller not changing the angle
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:55:50 yeah idk bout dat one dawg, its 5 degrees off i dont see a reason to change it that much
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:59:28 best of 2017
creations-chat 2023-01-22 20:01:43 omg the front gear LOL
creations-chat 2023-01-22 20:05:10 I want to see that "thing" in build mode, how do you even get that much exposed motor lock, I can understand a few but how are there that many on the wings alone??
creations-chat 2023-01-22 20:07:32 this looks like it was done from memory
creations-chat 2023-01-22 20:10:17 i swear this was there reference image bruh 💀
general 2023-07-07 03:54:39 I FORGOT THESE EXIST
