creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:39:13 First of all, I'm responding to your toxic, completely unnecessary comment. Second of all, maybe don't continue to confirm my theory that the PCC is full of toxic 10yos?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:43:14 tutorials are absolute shit compared to my creations, and yes, insulted. So you agree that you're a toxic 10yo?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:45:38 kinda funny coming from someone that's a 10yo themselves. 
and yeah, tutorials are shit. let's take a look at one of your creations, shall we?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:49:03 perhaps you could aid us on this quest?

i've already got a few custom angles
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:27:57 im not too familiar with custom angles

anyways, there's obviously a lot of room for improvement tho i was focused mostly on the rear
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:32:06 where 

explain

you seem to be more focused on insulting my build rather than telling me how i should improve it
creations-chat 2021-08-31 02:34:07 that's the only thing? pretty easy to fix
creations-chat 2021-09-01 19:30:50 im helping a friend with the mig 21, what do ya'll think

creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:08:07 things like mechanisms are fine
so nothing is wrong with performance builds
but when it comes to a build like a jet
looks are something you should really consider over functionality
creations-chat 2021-10-07 02:15:11 the whole plane isn't bad
u might wanna consider rebuilding certain aspects of ze plane tho

do you lack the brainpower to understand
that modified or not 
tutorials are disliked by the community 

oh yeah and it's not a good build lol
creations-chat 2021-11-16 23:35:03 exactly
creativity and innovation is what the pcc is about
and the very nature of tutorials defy that
modified or not

i found a way a while ago
but it requires some mechanical components
still pretty simple tho if u wanna see it
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:14:54 created a concept for mouse guided custom ailerons
ah damn i forgot abt slowmode
gotta wait 2 more mins till i can post a picture
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:22:33 sry for the bad quality of ze vid
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:25:43 true
then again
just a concept
i'll probably make improvements in the future 
any way i could make it more compact?
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:42:49 ah that's another issue
in 3rd person it still follows your mouse
but it's really unstable
creations-chat 2022-01-05 20:50:45 i've tried that
tbh i wouldn't call it unstable
just an irregular flight pattern

creations-chat 2022-02-26 04:22:18 reminds me of the amx 12t but without the oscillating turret for some reason
help 2022-03-01 04:49:14 the torque created by the main rotor makes the body spin in the opposite direction
you need the tail rotor to be countering that
creations-chat 2022-03-06 03:06:44 you only need 1 rotor in each corner

to prevent the body from rotating it's as simple as this
