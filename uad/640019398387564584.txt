general 2021-10-31 13:07:54 ironic that the israeli tree only has premiums in it
general 2021-10-31 13:08:50 might grind for the weasel
general 2021-10-31 13:08:53 it looks cute
general 2021-10-31 13:12:24 if israel is in wt now i’d like to see a Australia-NZ tree kinda like how the KMT and CCP both share a tree
general 2021-10-31 13:12:47 or atleast a unique line in the british or american techtree
general 2021-10-31 13:13:29 yeah ik
general 2021-10-31 13:14:21 thats why im saying that if israel has a tree other countries with a rider range of vehicles should be in wt too
general 2021-10-31 13:14:29 like serbia/yugoslavia

creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:47:02 my first plane was just multiple starter planes stuck together with a shitton of delta wings and propellors
creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:49:41 my second plane was a horrible copy of a tu95 that had nothing in common with it and was painted bright red and yellow with an extra pair of wings on the front to get its fat ass off the ground
creations-chat 2022-03-14 12:05:06 Give it more colours other than just black and green
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:43:27 literally just did that
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:45:11 you can 1shot leos with the BT's APHE if you know where to aim
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:46:55 from the side if you shoot right under the turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:47:20 its just enough
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:50:52 
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 05:51:29 you gotta have near perfect aim tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 10:27:45 he means the very bottom part of the ship that helps to counterbalance the vessel
