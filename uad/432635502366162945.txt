general 2021-12-05 01:49:17 your mother is a skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 16:57:51 but if i split the 7 into 4:3 does it go faster than 7:7
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 16:59:32 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 02:05:29 i took it down myself, didn't know it was yours my bad
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 02:11:32 my deepest apologies
i like your videos btw
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 02:11:38 pee shooter
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 02:11:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 21:16:54 if you had a 11 block long hover drive

would it be better to split it into 7:4 or 5:6
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:41:50 how do i split 10 hover thrusters
nevermind
7:3
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:47:56 where do i split the piston
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:48:01 on a hover drive
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:48:52 that sounds like a waste of speed
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:49:07 buh
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:54:28 if you have a 10 hover thruster long hover drive, split the drive into 7:3 for maximum efficiency
general 2022-02-28 01:09:16 whar
general 2022-02-28 01:11:14 i like kids (i don't)

general 2022-02-28 01:31:44 guh
general 2022-02-28 01:34:20 im woman
general 2022-02-28 01:36:16 i got image perms (real)
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:47:33 i've built it five times and it goes faster each time
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:48:10 it typically stops accelerating when i shatter into 400 pieces
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:50:01 it goes 2105
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:50:18 starts wobbling a little above 2106
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:50:23 speed is perfect
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:51:23 not as fast as gjsolos builds but it's decently fast for a big fat fucking behemoth
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:51:43 i could make it faster but it'll probably instantaneously combust
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:52:04 good
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:54:00 gank

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:55:26 really fucking strong ailerons
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:56:36 ok

you're gonna show me even if i said no aren't you
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:57:53 WUT DE HEEL!!!!!
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:07:23 adorable
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:08:03 my su-33 looks like a f15
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:09:00 it's grey
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:09:06 if you remove your eyes you won't be able to tell
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:17:36 if i removed majority of my wing panels and used half blocks will my plane still work
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:18:19 replacing some wing panels for half blocks does improve speed
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:18:49 well i don't need airspeed anyways i already go 2000
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:20:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:25:55 im alone in a empty public server
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:33:17 strange

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:37:37 not home
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 04:56:49 guh
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 04:58:21 manoeuvrability
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 05:00:04 spin
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 05:04:18 piss
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:52:15 im terrible at building, but i made my shitty tut go mach 3 while retaining supermanoeuvrability, and that's good enough for me
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:55:18 i don't wanna be reminded
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 13:56:16 if only i could forget
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 14:03:30 cool hangar
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 14:04:02 but the thing on the top spins
plane-crazy 2022-10-23 03:00:55 probably should've kept the original color scheme
plane-crazy 2023-04-28 01:49:06 truly harvard bound (what the fuck is that)
