plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:49:19 and rick copies the plane crazy scripts and impliments them into the new map
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:49:27 Hear me out okay?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:49:32 is that possable?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:49:44 exactly!

plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:50:34 I just had that idea while i was looking through the discord
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:51:26 how hard would that be tho?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:51:37 to transfer a game's scripts to another map file?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:52:32 let me guess... Impossible?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:52:38 yeah

plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:57:30 so the only reasion plane crazy isnt being updated, is because Madattak's internet is down?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:57:38 wow
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:57:48 but the other innovation games got updated
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:58:23 so couldn't the plane crazy co developers update the game  then?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:58:30 aka Rick.
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:58:46 or does he have to wait on madattak?
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:59:05 uh
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 16:59:22 so the game owner must be the one to update the game and publish changes?

the-dump 2020-07-08 17:33:57 Dont ask what happened to the ship in the screenshot
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:08 I was afk for 10 minutes and I came back to that
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:17 ...
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:24 How the hell would I know?
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:35 It must've hit something...
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:34:42 Holy f*bleeep*
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:35:06 It somehow managed to damage its funnel too.
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:35:27 *grey = damage*
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:15 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:37 Autopilot and the collision avoidance system was on
the-dump 2020-07-08 17:58:44 I have no idea what it hit..
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:05:46 When you try to roast someone and they say *"No U"*
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:07:44 Its spraying itself
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:08:13 Supposed to be spraying forwards, but because of the ship's speed it just goes back at the windshield.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:09:13 The ship was going 62 MPH at that point
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:09:32 Or 101 KPH
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:12 So it was going fast for a ship
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:28 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:51 That's in knots. Shove that in a calculator to get mph or kph
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:10:59 Yeah.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:09 But plane crazy doesnt have a definite speed unit
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:27 Its just speed.
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:11:47 What unit? How would you compare it to a realistic build if you're doing a direct replica?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:14 Liek for example,  if you wanted to do a replica of the carnival dream..
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:26 Everything down to the top speed (22 knots)
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:12:35 How would you figure that out?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:18 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:54 What unit is it closest to irl
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:14:59 M/s?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:15:06 Feet per seccond?
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:15:27 I know stormworks defaults to meters per seccond
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:16:01 Hence how I can do all those conversions on my yacht's top speed
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:17:07 So basically you would take the plane crazy speed and divide by 20
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:17:21 Then convert that from m/s to whatever
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:20:45 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:07 Tell me that's not accurate
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:16 Uh no
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:27 
the-dump 2020-07-08 18:21:39 How the bots think squeakers are

general 2020-07-20 10:06:39 And a toxic material that we in reality will NEVER be able to manufacture nor obtain on planet earth.

general 2020-07-26 07:29:51 No it's not a rickroll
general 2020-07-26 07:29:59 ...
general 2020-07-26 07:30:03 Play it.
general 2020-07-26 07:30:10 I dont do rickrolls
general 2020-07-26 07:30:24 .
general 2020-07-26 07:30:32 Fine.
general 2020-07-26 07:30:47 Its actually a beat i made
general 2020-07-26 07:30:53 On my phone..
general 2020-07-26 07:31:46 <a:triggeringbend:728118586492846130>
general 2020-07-26 07:32:23 Just play the mp3 why would i go through all the trouble to put it on onedrive for a rickroll?
general 2020-07-26 07:32:56 <@447221768520859659> 
What you think?
general 2020-07-26 07:33:19 My first audio I've made in a long time
general 2020-07-26 07:33:27 Oof
general 2020-07-26 07:34:00 > And i am on phone
Mobile data?
general 2020-07-26 07:34:56 Oh yeah I probably should mention that the beat was made using stereo headphones
general 2020-07-26 07:35:10 So the best result is heard with headphones

the-dump 2020-07-27 04:24:43 Phase 2 complete
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:10 You have no idea how much I had to fight my laptop to record that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:19 3 hours
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:38 3 hours of fighting my laptop
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:25:45 For these 20 secconds
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:26:23 Notice what's new on it?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:28:41 Yeah and the NAV lights as well as an extended superstructure
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:28:58 Also comms antennas
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:17 Bruh
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:27 Its been upgraded
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:30:37 Phase 2 of the superstructure construction
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:31:28 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:31:43 First picture is before today seccond picture is after today
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:08 ..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:23 Because I'm proud of it.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:25 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:41 The bow better?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:32:52 Wdym.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:33:09 The stern will be smoothed out in phase 4
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:33:39 Phase 2 which was today's work was just the superstructure improvements
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:07 Might start work on smoothening the stern tomorrow
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:21 Hmm
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:34:39 This is about a week's worth of work
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:04 The hull will be improved tomorrow..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:18 Tug?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:20 Ah
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:38 It's like that for a reasion
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:35:58 Cant make it rounder
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:09 Thats the roundest that's possible in stormworks
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:24 Oh
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:38 I see what you mean by fireboat resemblance
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:36:49 It kinda does double as one.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:37:14 *you've seen the demo of the water cannon I assume*
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:37:30 Yes?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:06 What do you mean by that?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:14 Like, not being smooth?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:38 Ease of building
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:38:57 OH
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:03 I get what you mean
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:08 The stripe right?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:20 The blue stripe?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:39:34 Or you're not talking about color?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:08 Hmm.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:21 I don't go for realism..
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:43 Also tbh the most efficient hull you can have in stormworks is a block.
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:41:47 No joke
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:00 Jeez!
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:20 That Sucker is **HUGE**
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:36 Right right
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:42:47 I like to make my hulls smooth
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:21 Eh, and I'm fine with that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:35 Keep in mind that all my ships are fictional
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:43:42 The PT Jumper especially
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:44:02 There is no way a ship that weight and size could hydrofoil in the real world
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:44:28 Sure
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:03 This is one of the few I have of it hydrofoiling
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:05 I don't record much
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:45:40 See that black trail by the rudders?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:46:00 That's an infinite generator,  its basically an exploit
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:46:13 That's what powers the hydrofoil motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:47:54 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:48:12 Jumper class yachts... wouldnt be effective in offensive or defensive
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:48:29 It's only able to be armed with a fluid cannon
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:50:23 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:50:44 It can hit a top speed of 110 knots with the foils active and jumping mode active
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:03 Usually it sticks around 80 or 90 knots when foiling
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:35 I've memed the engine blow footage
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:38 Wanna see?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:51:47 > that gif looked around 40 kots
<@471095469402095627> 
Bad framerate
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:00 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:37 Also
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:52:43 That was purposely done
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:53:00 I actually rigged up the ship to exploade on command for that
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:53:12 It was part of a joke
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:15 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:32 Its the same gif just cut and sped up
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:54:51 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:55:37 You see the gif on my pfp?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:08 This one
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:08 
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:56:18 That was an accident
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:16 Yeah the electric motors will overwhelm the engines when they're backfed into them
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:32 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:57:48 Generators and prop drivers
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:05 The electric motors act as, sort of a nitro system
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:13 Gives the ship a boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:58:47 The generators run on the same shaft, so yes and no
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:08 What exploded was the diesel engines
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:24 Also know that exploit I was telling you about?
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:35 The inf generator
the-dump 2020-07-27 04:59:50 Yes but the diesel engines can also power the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:09 The diesel engines primarily power the props alongside the gens
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:17 The electric motors serve as a boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:00:53 Noe.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:08 The diesel engines can power the props without the electric motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:18 Its just, really slow
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:31 Like 16 knots
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:01:56 > what is you are talking to about
<@472553877711880211> 
PT Jumper, one of my ships
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:04 That's the auxiliary
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:15 Nah
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:02:48 This will answer that question
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:06 Yes lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:12 XD
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:26 Gearbox trickary
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:03:37 That's how it goes so fast with the electric motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:11 1:12 ratio for the boost
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:15 Yep
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:27 Noe...
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:38 Both run the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:04:53 The diesel engines and the boost motors run the props
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:03 They can do it individually or in unison
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:16 The inf gen powers the motors
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:27 That's the black smoke comming from the stern
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:34 Just an exploit
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:37 That's all lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:47 Basically a flywheel
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:05:54 That's being crushed into turning
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:09 Then the physics of said wheel makes it spin like crazy
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:26 Lol
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:40 Because off topic discussion
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:06:57 > Because off topic discussion
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:07:34 Idk

general 2020-07-27 05:08:55 401k is a retirement plan
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:09:42 Oh yeah the jumper can also fire derpy missiles
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:10:13 They have no guidance
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:03 
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:35 I've slammed it into everything I could to sink it
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:11:45 Took like 40 hits on the bow
general 2020-07-27 05:12:03 It is
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:12:50 It got wedged in the ice once too
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:13:06 The bridge was all screwed up and unresponsive
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:14:52 Nah.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:16 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:42 The control panels and helm were absolutely obliterated
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:15:55 Shouldn't have went afk.
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:16:26 I went afk.. and the collision avoidance system bugged and got itself cornered
the-dump 2020-07-27 05:17:27 Stormworks logic

the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:55 Can you guys actually make this out?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:46:58 PC users.
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:31 You on computer?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:37 Its enlarged for mobile
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:47:47 It's supposed to be tiny
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:05 Ah
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:11 Boate
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:26 Original
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:48:49 It's slow tho
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:10 The actual ship is slow as hecc
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:20 Maybe
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:28 This is stormworks tho :p
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:43 Stormworks=Plane Crazy 2?
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:49:57 XD
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:50:15 They're raising the price to 24 USD September 17th
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:50:26 Because it's being taken out of early access
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:51:27 Abstract art be like
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:51:47 
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:56:08 Wot
the-dump 2020-07-28 21:58:26 
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:15:59 Oh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:16 Can you guys make out what this is?
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:34 I assume not
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:47 Yes its the same as my pfp...
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:16:56 Just recut and sped up, as well as shrunk
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:15 
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:20 Its this
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:17:32 Look at the radar tho
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:07 It's nowhere near 60 fps
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:09 That's sped up
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:18:37 Its edited to be faster
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:20:06 This is closer to the real speed
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:21:04 This is the real speed
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:21:24 I has like 7 or 9 fps at the time
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:06 The ship is even slower now
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:30 Eh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:35 Because I'm proud of it
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:38 That's why
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:22:50 Also this *is* out of date
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:23:19 I've gotta fight my computer to record another short of it...
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:23:56 E
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:24:06 My laptop takes forever to load up..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:24:26 Just wish I could buy a desktop unit now, from selling the damned craptop.

the-dump 2020-07-28 22:26:11 That's goanna be 50 times better than this piece of trash
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:08 Wonder if I could sell it for the price it was bought at
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:27 Its 2 years old
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:38 My current one is an HP 15-F387WM
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:27:46 Not really
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:04 But since we've done so much work some panels on the keyboard tend to unsnap themselves
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:19 And the keyboard comes up from time to time
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:43 Uh..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:28:50 500? I'm not sure
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:01 I know they aren't made anymore
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:24 Aw
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:29:38 I was hoping for at least 300
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:09 Hmm.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:13 Thatd be better tbh
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:26 Ah oh well
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:30:46 I'll just have to resist the urge to snap this thing in half for another year or so
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:31:26 > Ru able to add an ssd to it

the-dump 2020-07-28 22:31:47 I'm not sure it would even work with a SSD
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:34:02 Yep

the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:08 I'm not sure about the price
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:19 My parents bought it for school
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:31 It got me in trouble ALL THE TIME for how slow it was
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:45 My laptop hates discord
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:36:49 4gb ram sucks
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:16 We were supposed to get more but I was talked out of it, because my laptop is a lost cause
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:26 I tried
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:42 But, nobody listens and instead blames what's on my file
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:37:59 Files..
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:02 Games and such.
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:19 We spent almost 800 bucks on a new laptop for school
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:25 And its 100 times faster
the-dump 2020-07-28 22:38:37 Because it's actually WORTH the money

Basically what it is.
It's an amphibious rescue vehicle.
general 2020-08-25 01:00:11 Tell me what makes it look like a train.
general 2020-08-25 01:00:48 That, is true
general 2020-08-25 01:01:06 Although,  there are no storms in stormworks yet..
general 2020-08-25 01:01:22 After the next update though, aparently there will be
general 2020-08-25 01:02:12 What the
general 2020-08-25 01:02:46 I really want to know what makes Aerobus 2 look like a train though
general 2020-08-25 01:02:53 Is it the wheel placement?
general 2020-08-25 01:03:05 ...
general 2020-08-25 01:03:14 So the wheel placement is the problem
general 2020-08-25 01:03:23 Oop
general 2020-08-25 01:03:56 There are arches
general 2020-08-25 01:04:35 The suspension is legit INSIDE the arch
general 2020-08-25 01:04:48 With the tire sticking out
general 2020-08-25 01:05:16 Oh..
general 2020-08-25 01:05:26 It's an 8x8
general 2020-08-25 01:05:44 Oh..
general 2020-08-25 01:06:03 They are actually
general 2020-08-25 01:06:28 
general 2020-08-25 01:06:39 Yeah..
general 2020-08-25 01:07:04 If I have it inside, it would jam the steerint
general 2020-08-25 01:07:08 Steering*
general 2020-08-25 01:07:19 Stormworks logic :p
general 2020-08-25 03:13:09 Ooh

general 2020-08-25 03:15:05 Uhhh.
general 2020-08-25 03:15:15 Pistons might make you spas out
general 2020-08-25 03:15:20 From my experience
general 2020-08-25 03:15:45 Not related to plane crazy, but I've got a bone to pick....
general 2020-08-25 03:16:35 In Five Nights at  Freddy's,  the phone guy says this, "The animatronics go into a free roam state to prevent their servos from locking up," but
No servo I've seen locks up on you after inactivity.
general 2020-08-25 03:16:51 They do make servos however that are built to lock up
general 2020-08-25 03:17:07 I get that
general 2020-08-25 03:17:24 Corparate wouldn't know about the possessions though
general 2020-08-25 03:17:41 Technically though, the soul cant do crap
general 2020-08-25 03:17:48 Right.
general 2020-08-25 03:18:04 But, I'm thinking from a realistic robotics point of view
general 2020-08-25 03:18:25 The soul cannot shock the mainframe enough to override control.
general 2020-08-25 03:18:45 Souls are low heat forms of plasma

general 2020-08-25 03:19:29 Heh, I wanna send my robot after one of the souls, I was in the FTC for 8th grade.

general 2020-08-25 03:22:16 We were on a roll honestly.
general 2020-08-25 03:22:30 Until this virus came and slapped the team in the face
general 2020-08-25 03:22:51 Because of it, the team is mostly disbanded.
general 2020-08-25 03:23:04 And our robot has crippling depression
general 2020-08-25 03:23:23 It's been stuck in a dark crate the whole time

general 2020-08-25 03:23:57 Ha..
general 2020-08-25 03:24:15 Once I actually got the robot to grab the main pilot's foot. *I was the co pilot*
general 2020-08-25 03:24:49 The main pilot controls the drive and steering, the co pilot controls the arm. It's quite simple.
general 2020-08-25 03:25:06 Aeromorphs?
general 2020-08-25 03:25:26 Uhh.

general 2020-08-25 08:19:50 Honestly, I'm not into anime,  but certain games I'm interested in the art style
general 2020-08-25 08:19:58 Take Arknights for example
general 2020-08-25 08:20:26 Its art style is phenomenal,  and the story keeps you hooked
general 2020-08-25 08:20:52 Referring to Arknights,  not deviant art obviously
general 2020-08-25 08:21:37 Oof

general 2020-08-25 08:23:00 Its for a game I had in the past
general 2020-08-25 08:23:17 Gameplay is nothing like that, clickbait ad.
general 2020-08-25 08:23:23 Clickbait
general 2020-08-25 08:23:54 Eh.

general 2020-08-25 08:24:25 Raid, is just overkill
general 2020-08-25 08:24:41 Yup
general 2020-08-25 08:25:09 Although, I got hooked to Arknights because eof a song they used in one of the ads
general 2020-08-25 08:25:21 "Eof"
general 2020-08-25 08:25:43 Nah
general 2020-08-25 08:25:51 The song name is Speed of Light

general 2020-08-25 13:24:04 What?
general 2020-08-25 16:33:38 I wonder how little you can edit a song file for roblox to accept it.
general 2020-08-25 16:34:05 Like, for it to not get marked as copyright infringement
general 2020-08-25 16:35:14 Because honestly,  I can't stand nightcore audios, and I'd like the audio to be as close to the original as possible
general 2020-08-25 16:36:03 Bruh
general 2020-08-25 16:36:16 Oof
general 2020-08-25 16:36:22 Roblox logic
general 2020-08-25 16:37:14 I'm going to pitch mine up a tiny bit though
general 2020-08-25 16:37:37 And maybe add reverb just to be safe
general 2020-08-25 16:37:51 I'm not changing it by a milestone
general 2020-08-25 16:38:05 My goal is to stay as close to the original as possible
general 2020-08-25 16:41:42 Damn, do I love reverb
general 2020-08-25 16:41:56 I've got a consert hall in my headset now lol

general 2020-08-25 16:44:29 Reverb never fails to amaze me.
general 2020-08-25 16:45:10 I don't wanna go over the top on it though,  because I don't know how roblox reacts to it.
general 2020-08-25 16:50:09 Okay guys...
general 2020-08-25 16:50:18 I need your opinions on something.
general 2020-08-25 16:50:23 Hang on.
general 2020-08-25 16:56:28 Do these two sound significantly different?
general 2020-08-25 16:56:41 F
general 2020-08-25 16:56:55 It sent the full folder
general 2020-08-25 16:57:11 Probably so
general 2020-08-25 16:57:45 I'm trying to bypass the Roblox copyright system with the least amount of edits
general 2020-08-25 16:57:55 And I've got to go
general 2020-08-25 19:00:03 I've managed to make the song sound like the singer is gender swaped
general 2020-08-25 19:00:21 All I had to do was reduce the pitch by 20
general 2020-08-25 19:00:48 Sounds like a boy now..
And it's not too bad, but the beat and background effects are screwed
general 2020-08-25 19:04:05 Nevermind,  85 is the sweet spot
general 2020-08-25 19:04:13 What
general 2020-08-25 19:04:27 Oof
general 2020-08-25 19:04:45 I'm doing this to get a song onto roblox. Attempting to bypass copyright
general 2020-08-25 19:04:55 With this pitch Shift, it will sound like a cover
general 2020-08-25 19:06:42 You gotta do what you gotta do
general 2020-08-25 19:07:01 It actually sounds like a gender swap tbh.
general 2020-08-25 19:07:48 https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgsbJyEShB1wrW7OWeTzowP0tQq0
This is the original
general 2020-08-25 19:08:08 I'm working on this newer pitched one.
general 2020-08-25 19:08:37 Ah
general 2020-08-25 19:08:58 I downloaded it because one of the ads got a song stuck in my head
general 2020-08-25 19:10:11 The original?
general 2020-08-25 19:10:44 https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgsbJyEShB1wriMWw5ljt3ZEVHMf
Now here's the "gender swap" version
general 2020-08-25 19:11:20 Water?
general 2020-08-25 19:11:35 Oh yeah.
general 2020-08-25 19:11:46 The pitch shift messed with the background
general 2020-08-25 19:11:53 *sorry*
general 2020-08-25 19:12:37 Think it would get struck down?
general 2020-08-25 19:12:47 On roblox

the-dump 2020-09-24 14:24:51 with codeing, at least you get to see a result in the end
the-dump 2020-09-24 14:24:53 Unlike math
the-dump 2020-09-24 14:25:05 where your only result is a bunch or giberish numbers

the-dump 2020-09-24 15:27:47 but it's not infested with shredder bugs at least
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:28:47 they're fixing lag problems in the next few updates
the-dump 2020-09-24 15:29:00 also SW gets updated often

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:07:16 Imagine what JFK would think about modern America
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:07:30 Or George Washington

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:22:11 Because all I see are flashing lights of the characters and them yelling
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:26:13 My opinion on bullying,  and the time when I snapped.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:09 For those who couldn't figure it out, said "bomb" never went off
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:24 Never was a bomb in the first place
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:27:33 Was more of a fire hazard.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:28:49 This applies to personality too.
Like me for example,  I'll get overly excited about random things because of my ADHD.
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:51:01 > <@426802747875131393> thats too fucking far even for me

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:55:11 Hmm
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:55:55 When you are so overworked and stressed that you want to stab/melt/kill something

the-dump 2020-09-30 13:57:26 Mm
the-dump 2020-09-30 13:57:51 Honestly I've gotta get out of my current issues before that reality slap comes in.
the-dump 2020-09-30 14:01:26 Honestly, 2020 has been hell, but 2020 made my hopes collapse with the passing of my old doggo, but made my hopes rise when I met Emily.
the-dump 2020-09-30 14:02:09 *"We head into the darkness to find the light"*
Perfect description of 2020 for me so far.

the-dump 2021-01-15 07:39:00 Maybe a similar phenomenon that causes the moon phases
the-dump 2021-01-15 07:39:30 Or maybe someone photoshopped a crescent moon on the moon landing picture.

the-dump 2021-01-17 04:51:55 Figured I'd post 2 more audios here...
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:06 Eh?
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:17 
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:28 He left?
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:52:34 Ouf
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:53:16 
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:53:26 Day 2 of recommending this song
the-dump 2021-01-17 04:54:17 Honestly, it has a kind of calming vibe
the-dump 2021-01-18 04:54:03 
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:38:32 I'd hate to say, but I might be getting into media from across the Pacific Ocean.
You can see where I'm going with this.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:42:03 Reasonable reaction
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:42:42 I've fought the want to try it for a while now..
But alas, when a song gets stuck in your head it torments you until you find a source.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:44:34 Eh.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:44:53 My mind has been eroded faster than Grand Isle Louisiana by high school
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:45:04 It'll never be that far
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:45:59 Yeah...
That's not happening
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:47:19 Although, this experience could have the potential to make me multilingual
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:48:32 Honestly, I'm not getting into it because of another person.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:48:55 I've slipped across a few audio tracks from the series, and now they're stuck in my head...
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:26 Soo now I'm  hoping that seeing the context they were used in will get rid of them looping.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:42 Hmmm seems legit
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:49:46 I relate
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:50:19 Insanity intensifies
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:51:25 I mean, I've been near my breaking point before, and I don't want to go back.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:51:46 I don't like myself when I'm in that state...
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:52:23 I used to be suicidal
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:52:58 I actually almost took my own life...
But now I've realized through therapy that suicide or death is not the answer.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:53:47 Let me just say, High School is hell. For those who haven't been through it yet.
***Prepare for the worst!***
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:54:30 No, I might end up attempting suicide again
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:54:49 And this is completely unrelated to my school career.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:55:31 Like I said, I used to be suicidal.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:55:44 Because yes, that's why
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:05 What is life, an illusion?
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:32 You could've offered a year ago when I was fighting the urge to end it all....
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:56:55 But support helps.....
It's nice to know others care about you.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:57:26 See, the way to prevent a suicide is to make the person feel wanted in this world.
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:58:04 Or when your mind makes you *think* that.
And torments you for it
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:58:50 Eh, like I said, life is an illusion
the-dump 2021-01-19 14:59:11 The dump is literally a dump for random *bleep*
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:08 What for
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:31 .
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:00:36 I see watermark
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:01:38 You've ruined your spellcheck
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:02:09 Ah
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:27 Because yes...
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:33 Notice how I've stopped
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:03:47 I've already had therapy, for 7 months
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:04:48 I meant notice how I've stopped talking about it.
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:05:15 In most cases, yes
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:06:08 In others however, it isn't the therapy that helps.
It's the feeling of purpose in this world.
However,  not everyone can be saved by their self inflicted demise.
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:06:27 He asked
the-dump 2021-01-19 15:07:57 You have to find your purpose.
the-dump 2021-01-20 16:05:19 Truth: Am I a joke to you?

the-dump 2021-01-23 04:27:09 What?
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:28:21 Because yes, that's why
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:29:28 Arknights really likes pairing Steve Aoki with RUNN
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:30:06 Last of me, and End like this, have them paired.
the-dump 2021-01-23 04:31:09 I mean, I'm not complaining, they're great working together..
But it's just a little funny.

plane-crazy 2021-04-28 20:52:46 It's a type of shredder, notice the cutters on the sides as fins.
plane-crazy 2021-04-28 20:54:21 Just because it isn't a bug, doesn't mean it's not a shredder.
A shredder is defined as a vehicle in which utilizes the cutter block to an extent that it can be apparent that its primary mode of attack is to cut and or shred an opponent.
general 2021-04-28 20:55:21 Apparently 150k people

plane-crazy 2021-04-28 20:58:34 We issue counterforce if said shredder shows to be a nuisance or a threat.

general 2021-04-28 21:23:25 Adopt me has broken COPPA Laws
general 2021-04-28 21:24:10 My point is, that adopt me is infamous for crashing the platform, and also is a scamming heaven for the squeakers.

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:30:56 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:31:05 This
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:32:32 Trauma
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:00 Car wreck in a peel p50
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:16 If you somehow manage to survive
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:43 Nah 60 mph head on
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:52 Speed.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:34:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:34:37 Race a peel against a motorcycle
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:34:49 I Bet the motorcycle will win.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:35:31 You just got yanked into brazil.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:35:45 Nah. Japan
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:35:56 Here XD
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:36:03 F
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:36:09 Send in dms I'll post
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:38:10 E
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:38:15 E
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:41:20 Is there a value in speed that plane crazy will just display "NaN"? (Not a number)
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:42:54 Oh
creations-chat 2021-06-08 14:45:03 Post old as crap, I know. But I'm building a replica of the RI Landship as well, does yours happen to be from Arknights as well?
creations-chat 2021-06-08 14:51:57 Oh...
Stalemate.

When mine is finished, wanna 1v1 with our two landships?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 15:06:45 Kiting?
general 2021-06-08 15:36:07 Is astrocraft available on mobile?
general 2021-06-08 15:36:17 F
general 2021-06-08 15:37:09 Reminds me of starscape...
general 2021-06-08 15:37:37 That ain't small
general 2021-06-08 15:37:57 Meshes are more detailed
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 15:38:59 Why no beams
general 2021-06-08 15:41:26 Lol my craptop is just on the chrome new tab page, and it's already going brrrr
general 2021-06-08 15:41:41 I don't use it anymore, since I have a better computer now.
general 2021-06-08 15:41:58 Y
general 2021-06-08 15:42:31 .
general 2021-06-08 15:42:40 AK better. Smh
general 2021-06-08 15:43:09 Not that I'm aware of
general 2021-06-08 15:43:30 Haha craptop go brrr.
general 2021-06-08 15:43:41 I just hear it in the background.
general 2021-06-08 15:43:59 Oh, for meshes.
general 2021-06-08 15:44:26 E
general 2021-06-08 15:44:31 Imagine E
general 2021-06-08 15:44:51 Oop
general 2021-06-08 15:45:32 As far as features go, plane crazy wins by a milestone in my opinion.
As far as detail capability goes, astrocraft takes the cake I believe.
general 2021-06-08 15:46:27 Me in astrocraft: ***I AM SPED***  *casually slapping 50 engines as main propulsion*
general 2021-06-08 15:46:58 Basically from what I see..
general 2021-06-08 15:47:33 What the hecc
general 2021-06-08 15:47:59 As I casually build a landship
general 2021-06-08 15:48:23 Is there driving mechanics actually?
general 2021-06-08 15:52:21 Taking the EA approach I see
general 2021-06-08 15:53:29 Does astrocraft have multiplayer?
general 2021-06-08 15:53:39 I see in the base game the servers max at 1
general 2021-06-08 15:53:59 Oh, okay
general 2021-06-08 16:04:50 PC is slowly dieing with roblox constantly breaking it with physics updates...
general 2021-06-08 16:06:04 Wow, astrocraft has colab building?
HMMMM
general 2021-06-08 16:06:19 That's the selling point lol
general 2021-06-08 16:06:25 Colab building
general 2021-06-08 16:06:33 Lol
general 2021-06-08 16:06:53 E
general 2021-06-08 16:06:57 E
general 2021-06-08 16:07:26 Dear freaking god.
general 2021-06-08 16:10:35 Yes
general 2021-06-08 16:10:44 Throw those squeakers.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:52:29 *kills*
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:52:46 Lol
bug-reports 2021-06-08 17:15:17 I probably shouldn't be here, but piston glitch?
bug-reports 2021-06-08 17:15:29 .
bug-reports 2021-06-08 17:15:52 Asking if it was fixed.
general 2021-06-08 17:28:03 The pvp giveaway is usually the presence of either a shredder, rocket/fireworks spammer, or spawnkillers.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:17:36 Block
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:18:23 Mega blocc
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:18:58 Stik
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:19:20 Make a bonk
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:20:16 Now make a bonk stick
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:21:10 Now make a 3 headed plane.
*I dunno anymore*
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:21:27 Oo
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:22:47 Build smoll tonk
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:23:23 Or make a starter plane that goes the speed of light.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:23:48 I wanna see a starter plane go the speed of light lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:23:58 I'll settle for supersonic tho.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:24:11 Yus
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:24:29 Oh wait, that's what supersonic is?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:24:38 Do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:24:48 SPED
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:25:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:25:31 Might race you later with my ugly crap of a landship...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:25:54 Mobile screenshots since I don't have my computer rn.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:26:09 Willing to race.
Probably goanna be flung tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:26:55 E
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:27:31 MOAR BOOSTERS
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:28:16 My landship supposed to be a replica of this, but I failed.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:28:42 On the concept art?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:29:32 Sped
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:29:48 Super thrusters actually kinda have a speed cap.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:30:12 Y e s
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:30:22 I have a question.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:30:35 How do land vehicles with unpowered wheels turn?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:30:51 Like, my landship uses tank drive...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:05 But how does the vehicle turn
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:24 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:49 I like how nobody noticed the anime nameplate on the back of my landship..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:32:22 Although,  considering it was taken on a phone, it is kinda crappy quality
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:32:30 F
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:32:54 My ship has scaffolding,  but I don't need it..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:33:00 It's more for boarding..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:33:47 Because the boarding bay at the rear is hell for some people to figure out.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:34:03 So I had to make a dock so the side bays could be used.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:34:19 Lol.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:34:40 My landship has a song on it called speed of light. And it isn't what you'd expect it to be.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:35:38 Staying true to the ship's origins, it's a song produced to advertise the game it originated in.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:35:59 Actually,  it's because of that song that I got into the game :p
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:37:07 Shredder swarms.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:37:12 And AST intervention.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:37:27 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:37:38 Conveyor engine I suppose?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:38:05 And if the shredders start swarmin, the the AST goanna come knockin.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:38:22 We try, at least.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:39:38 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:39:46 What does it look like unfolded?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:40:10 I would join with mine, but I don't have my pc rn.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:40:54 Right
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:41:35 What's it based on?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:41:45 Ah, I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:42:19 Yeah, I kinda refuse to use folding... so that's why mine turned out garbage
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:43:10 B o t e
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:44:02 I don't
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:49:29 Yus
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:49:49 A fellow AK fan I presume?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:50:07 Yus
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:50:13 I am big dum
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:51:11 The RI even being almost my biggest build, I am kinda proud about it, while at the same time, disappointed at how it came out.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:51:54 Although, I hid some easter eggs in the interior.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:52:13 BOTE
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:53:02 Am currently jelly at someone else who beat me to build the RI, and who smoked mine as far as detail goes...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:53:34 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:53:43 To make you talk. 
Did it work?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:54:03 I mean...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:54:27 All the 'all terrain vehicles' in plane crazy are combinations of all of them.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:54:50 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:54:56 All the ones I've seen
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:55:18 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:56:06 I've argued enough with those people, and it is apparent that the sky is in fact, terrain.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:57:13 Hey dragon
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:57:27 What got you playing AK?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:57:38 For me it was 'speed of light'
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:58:04 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:58:15 It's a song..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:58:28 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:58:39 IKR
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:59:06 Sometimes, I do
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:59:23 My replica plays quite a few of them.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:03:13 What's funny is how almost half of the roblox community is toxic towards anime...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:03:28 I sense sarcasm
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:03:41 I honestly don't understand why.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:03:54 I mean, I'm pretty neutral..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:04:03 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:04:06 Probably so
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:05:00 You can tell if you're in a toxic server if you get hate for the AK title being on your backplate in its japanese translation
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:05:51 I am pretty neutral regarding anime, although I am slowly tipping into weeb territory.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:06:14 I can hear this.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:07:26 Is it just me, or is untitled world somewhat relatable?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:08:12 I've found an english version if you want it :p
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:08:58 Uhm..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:09:31 ...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:09:33 No...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:10:27 Isn't that a good thing? Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:11:18 Doktah
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:12:08 ...
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:12:11 Bru
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:13:11 Good
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:13:36 I had to uninstall AK because my phone was screeching over storage, sadly.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:14:02 Haha landships go brr
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:14:14 Mine can actually do some sick drifts too.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:14:24 *video not available*
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:15:18 And as a side effect of the traction thrusters...

It can climb walls..
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:16:17 And for the hell of it, it has an 'engine meltdown' feature
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:16:37 AK in this case, stands for Arknights.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:16:59 .
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:17:24 Oh also the drill on my replica doubles as a flinger/spinner.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:19:17 Although most of the time, I just throw the drill off the ship.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:21:26 I
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 19:21:35 But you shall not pass
general 2021-06-09 00:23:12 
general 2021-06-09 00:24:05 The fact that this has to exist is sad..
And shows a major problem with plane crazy.
general 2021-06-09 00:25:00 I know.
general 2021-06-09 00:25:18 We bust our sainity, and our keyboards in the endless war against the common enemy.
general 2021-06-09 00:26:14 We are recruiting btw..
general 2021-06-09 00:26:22 Just throwing that out there
general 2021-06-09 00:26:44 Sure.
general 2021-06-09 00:27:02 Watch it just be an illegal one.
general 2021-06-09 00:28:00 Dear god.
general 2021-06-09 00:28:18 Easily a land unit..
general 2021-06-09 00:28:38 You'd be perfect for the renegade G-Resistance squadron.
general 2021-06-09 00:29:08 Consider joining our ranks.
general 2021-06-09 00:30:08 It's pronounced as Renegade Resistance, since the G identifies it as a ground squadron.
general 2021-06-09 00:30:24 *fastest edit in the west*
general 2021-06-09 00:30:50 Fastest edit in the west lol
general 2021-06-09 00:32:51 I made a typo, and edited the message in a nanosecond
general 2021-06-09 00:35:06 No it isn't a dictatorship
general 2021-06-09 00:35:14 Wait, did it turn out like that?
general 2021-06-09 00:37:31 All that has been abolished as of now.
general 2021-06-09 00:37:37 We are restructuring.
general 2021-06-09 00:38:31 The discord server is more of a system to keep track of who is in the team, and for bulk announcements. 
And as well to not have to fight the roblox filter.

general 2021-06-09 20:21:11 My driveway this morning..
general 2021-06-10 22:24:32 E
general 2021-06-10 22:24:58 ..
general 2021-06-10 22:32:58 Place it into the ground and w a i t
general 2021-06-10 22:33:31 Of course they are..
general 2021-06-10 22:33:53 We need to mass report all the shredder bug tutorials
general 2021-06-13 05:01:47 What game is that.
general 2021-06-13 05:02:01 Ah
general 2021-06-13 05:02:24 The game that makes my computers go *BRRRRRRR*
general 2021-06-14 13:13:28 Just get on game and my damn dog turns the power strip off that my charger is plugged into. Shutting down my damn laptop since my parents insist that freeze downs don't exist, and insist on KILLING MY DAMN LAPTOP BATTERY WITH IT!
general 2021-06-14 13:13:54 Mildly infuriating
general 2021-06-14 13:15:22 I swear I'm tempted to bolt the damn strip to the wall.
general 2021-06-14 16:33:44 Wait, plane crazy can change interface language?
general 2021-06-14 16:33:53 I'm just noticing this  ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 16:36:07 Always did
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 16:36:22 Heavy load, or high speeds will break them
general 2021-06-14 23:27:16 Oh boy
general 2021-06-16 14:24:35 Lawsuits go brr.
Roblox being sued, expect a massive clap in the audios.
general 2021-06-16 14:25:26 ~~all the crappy rap songs, those rappers want their money for the little they do~~
general 2021-06-16 14:26:36 Watch, someone's going to say that those rap songs aren't trash.
general 2021-06-16 14:27:24 Look in announcements
general 2021-06-16 14:27:37 Basically
general 2021-06-16 14:30:08 *"for free"*
That's why they're sueing
general 2021-06-16 14:31:35 How much you wanna bet it's mainly rappers sueing
general 2021-06-16 14:31:53 Ikr
general 2021-06-16 14:32:00 Imagine
general 2021-06-16 14:32:28 Same.
general 2021-06-16 14:32:44 What
general 2021-06-16 14:32:49 Oh
general 2021-06-16 14:32:56 I don't even wanna know lol
general 2021-06-16 14:33:25 Kpop exists on roblox
general 2021-06-16 14:34:51 In my opinion, they're garbage...
I don't mean to sound racist at all, but it seems the black rappers are worse than the others. This is only my opinion.
general 2021-06-16 14:36:17 Just don't let them become rappers.
general 2021-06-16 14:37:36 And then there's the issue of roblox limiting friends...
general 2021-06-16 14:37:50 Like, other platforms like discord, or steam don't limit.
general 2021-06-16 14:38:06 Doubt
general 2021-06-16 14:38:34 If Valve's cheap servers can handle infinite friends, so can the roblox servers.
general 2021-06-16 14:38:46 That might be why.
general 2021-06-16 14:39:05 Offensive is funny in some cases....
general 2021-06-16 14:40:46 Yeah, imagine sueing a game company targeted at squeakers.

general 2021-06-16 15:18:16 I see no problem with that...

Although I'm not one to do it.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:19:16 Looks like an angry face to me..
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:20:37 Oh
general 2021-06-16 15:32:35 That username though
general 2021-06-16 15:37:11 Profile picture
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:46:54 ASDF?
Does that stand for something?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:47:19 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:47:44 I like how there are billions of groups dedicated to killing shredder bugs now
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:47:53 You would think they would get the message
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:48:02 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:48:16 AST is one of them, that I founded and run.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:50:45 When your acronym is a referance..
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:53:29 Our acronym is the flag
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:53:46 Something that you can actually put on the vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:54:37 Besides, if AST had a "flag" it would be confused with what it is referencing.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:57:35 Oh hell naw
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:57:51 Yeah delete that
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:58:20 Ha..
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 22:58:32 That would be the omni shredders.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 23:07:58 Reduced to atoms
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 23:45:59 Imagine if someone made the shuba duck in Plane Crazy
general 2021-06-17 01:31:13 Why we arguing over pfps?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 01:32:23 Kinda impressive.
general 2021-06-17 02:00:11 That pfp tho...
general 2021-06-17 02:06:00 Really true with JoJo, I'll give you that.
general 2021-06-17 02:07:29 I'm saying jojo is garbage.
general 2021-06-17 02:07:55 But at least it's not 90% screaming like Dragon Ball Z
general 2021-06-17 02:08:23 That's probably the only thing going for it
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:13:00 Wait why does that look familiar
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:13:25 I know it's a switch bait, but that "bait" looks familiar!
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:13:33 Hell..
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:14:47 I swear I've seen that character before....

Despite the fact that I've barely ever watched anime..
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:15:14 The few times I did, it was on adult swim when I lost my remote.
general 2021-06-17 02:15:56 What are your reasons?
general 2021-06-17 02:16:17 I'll admit, some are.
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:16:36 Too lazy to get up to fight the buttons...
the-dump 2021-06-17 02:16:47 Besides back then I had a loud as crap bunk bed
general 2021-06-17 02:17:24 Some
general 2021-06-17 02:17:32 I sense bias
general 2021-06-17 02:17:51 Says the one with an anime pfp.
general 2021-06-17 02:19:01 May hate anime, but this is still impressive.

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:52:34 Lowering torque helps sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:53:08 Reduce the load being pressed down on the motor as well.
general 2021-06-17 20:50:40 Why does this have a blue highlight?
general 2021-06-17 20:53:47 Is it possible to have saves sync over to the rework, or is it not possible?
general 2021-06-17 20:54:39 Rick, could the saves sync over or no?
general 2021-06-17 20:55:03 Oh, thanks

general 2021-06-17 21:01:53 We also need more of the "stone" terrain, to test suspensions.
general 2021-06-17 21:02:16 Ban hammer

general 2021-06-17 21:18:43 So there's going to be a "lobby" which would teleport you to either game?

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:45:57 Yes
bug-reports 2021-06-17 22:01:25 This happens to me sometimes too, reducing torque typically helps.
bug-reports 2021-06-17 22:30:39 Well reducing fixes my issues..
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:49:07 Sell the molton plastic to apple, so they can make an iPhone from it or some other crappy device that's doomed to break down.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:49:35 Rebel and buy your own.

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:51:06 Imagine breaking your parent's trust so bad that they lock up their credit cards in a vualt.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:52:26 Tanzanite chonk
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:52:43 Imagine if they just had a Tanzanite chunk in that vualt
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:53:10 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:53:41 Did your parents go through the great depression?

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:55:25 Kick them in the balls then
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:55:39 Punch them where it hurts
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:56:49 Brazil, China, or North Korea. You have to pick one to spend a month in. Where do you choose.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:57:24 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:58:06 I mean no offense, but China is kind dumb when it comes to human rights...
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 14:58:18 Although,  they're nothing compared to N. Korea.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:00:38 Imagine a city trying to become an independent country.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:00:48 Hong Kong: Am I a joke to you?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:02:07 Just realized I had the wrong there...
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:02:21 Oh well.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:02:49 Slightly, not fully..
Am fighting the urge to get into anime, but I am gradually losing.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:03:33 Snaps his neck
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:04:34 I had to put skirts on my Rhodes Island landship replica..
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:04:44 People kept going under it and screwing with the tracks.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:06:04 Okay..
Apparently #creations  is oy free tryhards
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:06:23 <@642324788429324301> get with a mod to sort this out..
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:07:11 Mods can, you can't
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 15:08:12 Go nuts
general 2021-06-18 15:21:34 Da hecc
general 2021-06-19 16:55:13 A sugarcane field would be a perfect place to hide a body..
general 2021-06-19 16:55:36 Me: *going on about how a chopper harvester can hide a body*

My FBI agent: ***HMMM, INTERESTING***
general 2021-06-19 16:57:10 Very interesting indeed.
general 2021-06-19 16:57:26 No joke, look up how a John Deere chopper harvester works.
general 2021-06-19 16:58:06 Yeah, and when harvesting time comes, the evidence gets shredded.
general 2021-06-19 16:58:26 Quite literally...
Or the correct term would be chopped.
general 2021-06-19 16:59:57 What is reality defined as is the question?
general 2021-06-19 17:00:14 *this went from an FBI agent joke to "what is life"*
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 22:48:37 Dont expect roblox to be realistic
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 23:10:47 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:03:43 So you know the phut hon meme dance right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:04:30 Well, one of my planes does it...
Originally unintentional, I put the music onto it to make light of the violent ahaking.
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:05:11 If anyone could possibly help me stabilize it, I'd greatly appreciate it..
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:07:41 I feel like recording my plane's shaking, then editing the music into it, and uploading the video as a meme.
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:08:26 I hope it gets patched
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 00:36:48 Has anyone ever made the Fraxinus from *Date A Live* in plane crazy before?
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 00:37:46 Here is a picture of its would-be concept art..
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 00:38:29 Versus the actual thing..

Only curious if someone did this before because I kinda wanna try to replicate it.
general 2021-07-05 22:25:06 That moment when the anti shredder groups go to war..
Me: "What? Yo we are literally the same thing!"
general 2021-07-05 22:27:19 Yeah, some other anti shredder organization is threatening war on the AST....

Like, bro, WE ARE LITERALLY THE SAME!
general 2021-07-05 22:27:51 Some other Anti shredder bug group is threatening war on mine.
general 2021-07-05 22:28:03 When we are literally the same thing
general 2021-07-05 22:29:26 "Different paths different names in the end it's all the same we're saving lives."
-Come to Light, Arknights EP 
(AST adapted theme song)
general 2021-07-05 22:30:14 We fight shredders here in the AST.
general 2021-07-05 22:30:23 We mainly go after minges tbh.
general 2021-07-05 22:31:01 Some group named "ASBT" is threatening war on us.
general 2021-07-05 22:31:11 Like bruh your name literally limits what you do.
general 2021-07-05 22:31:50 AST is AGAINST shredder bugs.
general 2021-07-05 22:32:03 It's literally our name, Anti-Shredder Team'

general 2021-07-05 22:32:52 No
general 2021-07-05 22:33:06 Our goals are to protect the innocent and fight for justice.
general 2021-07-05 22:33:42 The acronym is actually a referance...
general 2021-07-05 22:33:53 So a name change is not an option.
general 2021-07-05 22:34:24 Us in the team jokingly call it Anti Squeaker Team sometimes lol
general 2021-07-05 22:35:02 Because most of the minges we shoot down happen to be squeakers.
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 23:09:34 What about anime?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 23:16:52 <@330869457524359170>  you have radio pass? I may have an audio id to interest you.

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:51:32 Yeah don't use it with an AST agent around, or you'll get bombed in a heartbeat.
general 2021-07-15 00:51:55 Ah
general 2021-07-15 00:52:10 Well the AST is a team that has unique vehicles.
general 2021-07-15 00:52:42 My main one, AST Yankee is a former stunt plane turned fighter.
Capable of going supersonic if it has to.

general 2021-07-15 02:18:28 I once saw a bomber that sneezed cutters, ended up intercepting it due to protocol.
general 2021-07-15 02:19:07 One shot to the wing with my plane's turrets and it came spiraling down.

Where do you get flying wedge from that?
general 2021-07-15 02:20:45 Uhm
general 2021-07-15 02:21:11 My plane uses a good percentage of all weapons, and it isn't a flying wedge
general 2021-07-15 02:21:25 Only weapons it doesn't use are spitters
general 2021-07-15 02:21:56 The wingtips have cutters so I can slap those shredder bugs and potential slice their tails off.

general 2021-07-15 02:50:58 *you have been targeted by the AST, it is recommended that you stay low*
general 2021-07-15 02:51:52 We have rules against using shredders against shredders.
general 2021-07-15 02:52:25 Damn I wish I could just pop in and obliterate those shredders.

general 2021-07-15 02:55:26 Hey <@715169988352278530>  what's your roblox username?
Totally not asking for a hit list.
general 2021-07-15 02:55:59 Oh
general 2021-07-15 02:56:07 Mine didn't sync lol
general 2021-07-15 02:58:07 Mass report all shredder tutorials. Lol
general 2021-07-15 02:58:35 strafe has been logged as a target.
general 2021-07-15 02:58:58 AST will be keeping an eye on him.
And we will deploy as needed.
general 2021-07-15 03:00:53 Ah yes, the type 5, elongated boom bug.
general 2021-07-15 03:01:06 Not the worst
general 2021-07-15 03:01:14 Type 5 are easy to disarm.
general 2021-07-15 03:01:37 Easy to disarm as well if you know what you are doing.
general 2021-07-15 03:02:14 Us in the AST have figured out the weakness of almost every shredder
general 2021-07-15 03:03:03 My plane does that
general 2021-07-15 03:03:19 One shot hits from its turrets and that shredder is dead
general 2021-07-15 03:03:36 AST CR turrets are freaking OP
general 2021-07-15 03:03:58 That's why only our elites have them.
general 2021-07-15 03:04:27 A shredder will never be stable.
general 2021-07-15 03:04:47 Thx for that.
general 2021-07-15 03:05:02 Ah.
general 2021-07-15 03:05:16 My turrets are on my plane's wings
general 2021-07-15 03:05:31 The plane is capable of anchoring in place however

general 2021-07-15 03:11:43 Yeah...
Most anti shredder groups are unheard of
general 2021-07-15 03:12:13 We try to be, but some other group declared war on us ;-;
general 2021-07-15 03:13:58 We exist.
general 2021-07-15 03:14:13 And we, the AST try to advertise as often as we can
general 2021-07-15 03:16:02 And then I'll hand it down to the lead engineer.
general 2021-07-15 03:16:20 Anti shredder defense force or something like that.
general 2021-07-15 03:16:44 Our name is a referance. Well the acronym is.
general 2021-07-15 03:18:26 I'm currently the only representative here as of now...
general 2021-07-15 03:19:17 Segmented type 4
general 2021-07-15 03:20:20 Oh hell naw
general 2021-07-15 03:20:56 Anti Spirit team, Anti shredder Team, Anti Squeaker Team.
general 2021-07-15 03:21:49 That's what the referance is to actually.
general 2021-07-15 03:22:20 I mean, we are semi serious, but we mostly are serious
general 2021-07-15 03:22:41 We fight eachother from time to time as practice when no shredders are around
general 2021-07-15 03:22:55 Not at my pc rn

general 2021-07-15 03:24:19 Honestly
general 2021-07-15 03:24:32 We strike eachother down more than we encounter shredder bugs.
general 2021-07-15 03:24:44 It's fun tbh.
general 2021-07-15 03:24:59 Intentional dude
general 2021-07-15 03:25:14 We 1v1 eachother when we have nothin to do
general 2021-07-15 03:25:52 And when they do we shall rename to Anti Squeaker Team, or Anti Spammer Team.
general 2021-07-15 03:27:11 Shredder bugs better be non existant
general 2021-07-15 03:27:31 Although, AST will live on.
general 2021-07-15 03:28:31 I'm not familiar with them.
general 2021-07-15 03:29:17 How long ago was this update
general 2021-07-15 03:29:42 Yankee is faster
general 2021-07-15 03:30:05 If I were there, I could blast your wings off in a split seccond
general 2021-07-15 03:30:19 That's the name of my plane bruh
general 2021-07-15 03:30:31 Although the nameplate says ヤンキー
general 2021-07-15 03:30:52 Japanese nameplate because why the hell not.
general 2021-07-15 03:31:09 Also gets squeakers triggered, so we know who to target.
general 2021-07-15 03:31:20 Baka
general 2021-07-15 03:31:54 We've done that
general 2021-07-15 03:32:30 Mouse
general 2021-07-15 03:33:52 Sō ni chikuseki suru itami
general 2021-07-15 03:35:51 My bombs would blow my plane's tail up.
general 2021-07-15 03:35:58 So I removed them
general 2021-07-15 03:36:10 Sō ni chikuseki suru itami
general 2021-07-15 03:36:32 That would blast the wings to shreds
general 2021-07-15 03:37:05 Besides, had to purge them anyways to make room for the new turrets.

general 2021-08-23 19:38:09 I get stuck there sometimes
general 2021-08-23 19:39:57 Whenever someone decides to be cancerous and gets a flinger, my landship gets jammed into the map and eventually the bridge migrates to that empty space.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:42:03 Shredders will never be hall of fame, they are a pest and will remain so.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:45:49 That's a feature not a bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:46:47 Someone should make a mini version of the current map
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:47:08 Idk why, I think it'd just be neat

the-dump 2021-09-07 03:02:33 When you have a good car you built, and screw with the traction control
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:03:05 Hi there
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:04:16 
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:04:29 Electric race car go brr.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:05:37 It goes so fast now that it thinks it's a plane..
And I had to make the spoiler dynamic.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:03 Yes.
That's the name of the car.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:15 Because it's electric.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:11:50 Thanks.
One of the few good names I can come up with.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:12:40 The electro was actually built because someone else thought I couldn't build a race car.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:13:23 Stormworks, Build and Rescue
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:15:57 This is the previous race car, the one before electro.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:07 This one's retired now.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:35 It would always pop wheelies, and blow itself up
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:16:46 The spoiler you see is fake..
It does nothing
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:01 Electro is my first racer to use an actual spoiler.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:15 Yes, and boats.
And helicopters.
And tanks
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:21 And landships
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:29 25USD currently.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:41 Ikr
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:17:57 Weapons dlc comming out soon..
Like, in a few weeks
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:27 This was my first race car ever built. 
Nicknamed the beatle
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:40 Never made it to the track.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:18:57 It would flip over, and like a beatle, would get stuck.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:14 Also had a major traction issue.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:33 Tbh now that I think of it, electro is my first one to have TCS.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:19:40 Ironik
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:20:20 Found a pic of the gen 2 car doing a wheelie
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:21:51 35 is HTI's racing number. All the cars have that number.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:10 Technically incorrect
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:25 Stormworks isn't as exploitable as plane crazy is
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:22:51 And besides.. 
Crap like shredders are impossible,  since stormworks has actual drag.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:24:25 Did I stutter?
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:46:11 Me slidin away from my problems
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:19 Do it
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:24 I wanna see you try.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:47:36 Purely from scratch. No workshop stuff
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:48:19 I built electro from scratch..
It got its vintage shape on accident
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:48:46 Well, electro is a converted version of an old street use car..
Which was vintage shaped on accident.
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:49:06 I don't remember what I was going for tbh
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:49:31 What car looks better, 1, 2, or 3?
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:00 I also have some utility busses, but I don't have a pic on my phone
the-dump 2021-09-07 03:50:13 Not until DLC drops

the-dump 2021-09-07 03:51:16 Well yes, but actually no

the-dump 2021-09-27 22:52:18 So I got bored. 
And did a thing with my Arctic Express locomotive in stormworks
the-dump 2021-09-27 22:55:30 This is what the Express actually looks like
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:04:50 Same goes with shredder bugs
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:05:37 Manage to make one generation of bugs go extinct,  only for them to come back evolved.
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:05:51 Evolution shouldn't apply to cancer, yet here it is.
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:25:40 Not trying to be.
the-dump 2021-09-27 23:27:20 <@251386335883952129> it was nicknamed the Polar Express, but due to copyright, we had to officially name it the Arctic Express

the-dump 2021-09-28 01:20:57 Not f12 that's obvious
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:21:35 Also each hopper weighs twice the weight of the loco
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:22:09 Nah, we use the flatbed for that.
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:22:42 And 6 header locomotives, 4 power cars, and 7 trailing locomotives.
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:24:08 Btw like everything on this train, the hoppers are custom built by me.
the-dump 2021-09-28 01:24:36 Oh sheit

the-dump 2021-09-29 02:02:56 Light, and fast
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:03:31 POV, In front by the tracks
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:04:08 The cabin structure is 2 stories high. With the length of the entire cruiser being 23 meters
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:09 Oh yeah
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:13 It also freaking swims
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:17 
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:23 Idk anymore...
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:05:52 Try it, and I'll plow you down with the other 2 landships in its class
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:07:25 You should see what they're based off of
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:08:08 
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:09:04 Never thought I'd say this..
the-dump 2021-09-29 02:09:10 But the landship is sea worthy

the-dump 2021-10-01 00:21:12 Ironic, because that car is a generation 3 racer.
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:21:42 There's a catch tho
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:22:02 And the name probably gives it away
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:22:24 ~~electric race car~~
the-dump 2021-10-01 00:23:00 What about this for racing ?

general 2021-10-02 11:12:50 But one successor
general 2021-10-02 11:13:18 Sad thing is...
It's a desktop wallpaper,  so she's out of focus
general 2021-10-02 11:13:58 A landship can never call you ugly, or turn it's back on you.
Therefore, the RILS is best girl.
general 2021-10-02 11:14:10 If, it ever was gendered
general 2021-10-02 11:14:35 In it's what, 150 ish(?) Year life.

general 2021-10-02 15:34:25 *that's made up*
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:44:15 When you botch an edit, and it's memable as crap.
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:45:17 Example

the-dump 2021-10-02 15:54:10 Inevitable,  torment.
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:54:40 So is the reality of Earth becoming exactly like the Arknights world..
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:54:56 And landships becoming reality out of necessity.
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:55:09 Time, my friend

the-dump 2021-10-02 15:59:36 RILS.
True "Best Girl" in arknights.
Never gave out, despite being centuries old, and completely obsolete technology.
the-dump 2021-10-02 15:59:57 Thing is, it ain't gendered.. so there's no simping for it.
the-dump 2021-10-02 16:02:05 Unless you're a nerd like me, just hyper focused on the god damn colossal size of this thing..
the-dump 2021-10-02 16:02:47 Nah it tried towing your mom, and had a god damn structural failure.
the-dump 2021-10-02 16:03:17 Nah

general 2021-10-04 22:34:40 Ayo
general 2021-10-04 22:34:46 Quick question
general 2021-10-04 22:34:59 Which looks better, 1 or 2?
general 2021-10-04 22:35:20 The black letters are for referance
general 2021-10-04 22:35:37 Yeah spent 20 minutes on that A Only for it to turn out like that
general 2021-10-04 22:37:40 Final nameplate look
general 2021-10-04 22:37:54 Yay nay?
general 2021-10-04 22:38:06 The vehicle's name is LS Titan
general 2021-10-04 23:02:58 Final product
the-dump 2021-10-04 23:41:02 New landship I built.
Goanna use ot for weapons when they come out tomorrow.
the-dump 2021-10-04 23:41:07 LS Titan
general 2021-10-05 01:56:01 LS Titan. 
Battle landship  *unarmed*
general 2021-10-05 01:56:22 Will arm it tomorrow when Weapons come out
general 2021-10-05 01:56:31 Nah that's Rhodes Island
general 2021-10-05 01:56:35 Yes
general 2021-10-05 01:56:55 Ayo I found who asked!
general 2021-10-05 01:57:29 I'm also kinda proud of titan's nameplate
general 2021-10-05 01:57:54 It's called Titan because it's titanic but comparison to its sister ships.
general 2021-10-05 01:58:04 It's actually an Arknights reference
general 2021-10-05 01:58:30 Did a lil editing the other day
general 2021-10-05 01:58:54 
general 2021-10-05 01:59:13 They call me a weeb...
general 2021-10-05 01:59:28 Ye I'm literally only obsessed with the engineering in the background
general 2021-10-05 02:00:16 For example,  Rhodes Island,  and Fraxinus.
general 2021-10-05 02:00:41 Named after the japanese tree of life.
general 2021-10-05 02:01:01 It's an airship.
But it has branches to stay true to its name
general 2021-10-05 02:01:48 Tbh. LS Titan is probably about half the size of Rhodes..

I might end up building Rhodes Island LS...
general 2021-10-05 02:01:57 To scale
general 2021-10-05 02:03:00 And it is huge.
A person is by the front, I pointed them out
general 2021-10-05 02:03:33 Lol
general 2021-10-05 02:03:46 Tbh Rhodes has a top speed of 20 mph
general 2021-10-05 02:03:56 LS Titan has a top speed of 80 MPH
general 2021-10-05 02:04:14 E
general 2021-10-05 02:04:46 Oop
general 2021-10-05 02:05:03 Tbh I wish Arknights had an anime so I could get more perspective about the landships ;-;
general 2021-10-05 02:05:32 I'd love to see rhodes in operation..
general 2021-10-05 02:05:54 Although I suppose I can make that happen, since I build landships in stormworks.
general 2021-10-05 02:06:32 Do I even wanna know?
general 2021-10-05 02:06:39 No. I probably don't
general 2021-10-05 02:06:54 
general 2021-10-05 02:07:09 Ikr
general 2021-10-05 02:08:01 Titan's prototype..
It was a short boi.
general 2021-10-05 02:08:21 Now it's L O N G
general 2021-10-05 02:08:45 Eh
general 2021-10-05 02:08:59 Dual originium generators at her power core.
general 2021-10-05 02:09:09 She'll never run out of power.
general 2021-10-05 02:09:23 Perpetual motion powered generator cores.
general 2021-10-05 02:09:47 Just one unit can power the world for a century
general 2021-10-05 02:10:09 Stormworks lmao
general 2021-10-05 02:10:36 Besides.. Titan would eventually become target practice,  once it gets retired.
general 2021-10-05 02:11:22 Skill issu
general 2021-10-05 02:11:58 Tbh I'd like to see someone recreate my LS Titan in plane crazy. 1:1 Scale.
general 2021-10-05 02:12:10 I would
general 2021-10-05 02:12:18 If I still played plane crazy
general 2021-10-05 02:12:38 I'm quitting for a month, then returning
general 2021-10-05 02:13:08 Good strategy to not get "burnt out" from a game.
general 2021-10-05 02:16:57 It works
general 2021-10-05 02:17:03 I do it all the time

the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:06 HMMM YES.
SCIENCE FICTION
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:12 TOTALLY
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:43 DAL classifies as a harem comedy
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:19:58 Very little sci-fi
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:04 Wait. I take that back
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:40 
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:20:51 There do be sci fi
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:23 
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:33 Uhhhhh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:36 .
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:21:41 You don't get it
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:00 You *"date"* spirits....
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:17 Beings which cause spatial quakes when they enter our world
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:44 They're living.
They just become spirits with a sephara crystal
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:22:55 Being a spirit means you get powers.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:23:41 The date, if successful,  will prevent that.
It "seals" them, so they STAY in our world. In turn not causing spatial quakes.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:24:28 Interesting anime tbh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:24:56 Gotta get her to fall for you
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:01 Then kiss her
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:05 That create the seal
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:13 If you dont
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:19 And her emotions go unstable
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:35 You risk her causing a quake, or her angel summoning
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:25:57 And an angry spirit + her angel isn't good
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:26:50 Bruh
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:26:57 What the hecc
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:27:41 ..

the-dump 2021-11-18 05:32:39 That'd be interesting to see.
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:38:15 In that case
the-dump 2021-11-18 05:38:43 Anime out of context

the-dump 2021-11-19 20:51:24 Bit of a weeb rant.
But god damn the first season of Date A Live had crippling depression as far as its intro goes.
This is literally what the first verse looks like.
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:51:39 For comparison,  Here is the one from the third season
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:52:13 *I still gotta do the one for the second season*
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:52:40 Are all anime like this?
Are they always depressed in their first season,?
the-dump 2021-11-19 20:53:29 I mean, I get that japan has a problem with mass depression,  but god damn is it really THAT bad?
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:00:12 No I haven't. 
So it's actually that bad?
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:01:30 Jeez we need to ship a boat load of antidepressants over to japan
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:03:28 Look, I may be considered a weeb. 
But I'm never moving to japan.
If I would move, It'd not be by choice.
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:04:33 Yeah.
Japan has a crippled economy
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:06:58 
the-dump 2021-11-19 21:07:30 Yeah.
*"You're either a success or a disappointment"*

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:15 I now have a fear of upskirting thanks to Azur Lane
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:20 Yay what fun
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:18:54 I was never into it anyways.

the-dump 2021-11-23 04:21:57 Tbh I was shocked when I found out that Azur Lane actually has lore
the-dump 2021-11-23 04:23:06 Anyways.

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:28:45 I thought it was this December
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:28:53 Like, later this month
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:29:09 ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:29:16 O
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:29:36 How much is done currently,  anyone know?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:30:36 mRNA tech is almost nonexistent. 
That's how new it is
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:30:50 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:31:03 Is what the rumors say true?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:31:10 Will pc2 have an infinite map?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:31:37 Isn't that..
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:31:39 Smaller
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:31:52 Isn't that smaller than the current one?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:32:30 They could literally just.
Use auto generated terrain. And add on from there
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:32:54 Na I'm not believing him, that's why I'm calling him out
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:33:33 *"I may be an idiot, But I'm not stupid"*
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:34:30 What I built/remodeled to explore the "bigger" plane crazy 2 map
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:35:24 It's supposed to say Rhodes Island but I'd I put the S the filter hates it
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:35:38 I'm decent
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:35:48 A friend built the suspension on RI
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:36:02 He's pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:36:42 Yes I specifically requested it be simple
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:36:51 But there's more to it
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:37:06 I used forced perspective to hide it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:37:15 So you can't see it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:37:29 Bet
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:37:53 Can yours support a landship,  and climb up walls?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:38:10 **Yes, Rhodes can climb walls**
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:38:22 Especially blacklist barriers
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:38:30 Show

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:40:36 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:40:52 Wonder if the pc2 map will actually be bigger
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:41:03 By how much.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:41:13 Do y'all know?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:41:43 What kind of questionable

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:43:08 Probably a railroad
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:43:32 Forced perspective. 
He's facing the map edge
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:43:52 ....

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:46:07 I wonder
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:46:23 Would there be sharp hills/place sto test suspension
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:47:27 Yeah ik about that
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:47:38 Bu tf it's just..
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:47:40 Small
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:47:44 Too small
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:48:14 What I mean is something larger to test landship suspensions...
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:48:19 For a sense of scale..
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:59:33 Exactly

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:32:45 Also I have a fuckin grudge against that idiot
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:33:10 
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:33:41 Renegade is the only build to have nameplates of the original group name, and the new one

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:36:16 Also
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:36:32 The official retirement of the first ever vehicle in AST

Yet he literally fucking threatened me
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:39:26 I had to threaten him with a lawsuit to shut him up.
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:39:56 I doubt t that
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:40:07 Alpha is an idiot
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:40:11 Expect the worse
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:40:42 Mark of superiority

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:42:20 It's the exact funnel that that fell off
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:42:29 When it sunk
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:42:49 Alpha, and Jaanu are fucking heretics.
Shredder tuts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 16:43:30 I'll never use a shredder.
Never, even over my own grave!

the-dump 2021-12-31 17:08:00 Can someone give me an opinion on this nameplate? It's supposed to say HTILS Aura.
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:08:25 it's a miniture nameplate that's inside the landship's bridge
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:11:10 so... does that mean it's bad?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:11:51 does that mean it's bad?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:12:21 hmmmm
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:12:41 hey <@!707953054489509978> may I ask ya something?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:07 a
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:26 How would you rate this nameplate?
It's supposed to say HTILS Aura
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:42 ;-;
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:13:49 how might I improve it?
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:06 keep in mind that this is a small nameplate that goes in the bridge
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:13 so I really can't do a lot of detail
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:29 no, I just said why I cannot do that.
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:14:57 also the font is supposed to be custom, but it's difficult to do that with the small amount I have on that small nameplate
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:25 1x5 block nameplate.
I have very little room to do detail
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:50 
the-dump 2021-12-31 17:15:58 that's the boarders of the paint blocks

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye

the-dump 2022-02-02 13:53:07 *The dry wind passes through (Dead or alive)
The city of forlorn people
My eyes desperate for the light (Dead or alive)
Could only see~ the despair~

My mouth which screams are left unheard~
Seal it with your hand that ^I've been looking for^

In a world where everything is destroyed
I don't know the reason why, I'm still
Scared of the gentleness that you touched me with

Are you gonna be the one
Who will fill the all emptiness ^inside of my heart?~^*
the-dump 2022-02-02 13:53:53 *My pain that I'm suffering in silence~ (Dead or alive)
Has come up once~ again~
After this war is over ~(Dead or alive)
Will despair be the only thing that remains?~

My mind that nobody has ever cured
Clear it with your hand that I took hold of

In a world that everybody has rejected
I still can't find the way to
Keep being in it without having to hurt someone

Are you gonna be the one
Who will accept this feeling that will fade, without a place?
Please tell me, date a live...

Can't hold back~ (Resolution and desolation)
My lingering doubts~ (I wander alone)
A clash of conflicting views on justice~

Growing expectations~ (But truthfully~)
I just want to believe, if change is possible, ^Ohhh^

In a world where all is lost
I'm starting to feel that I've found something
From that hand that's reaching out to me

Faintly, bit by bit
This unclear feeling~
Is starting to affirm itself more

Are you gonna be the one
Who will change the rumb-ling course of my heart?~*

the-dump 2022-02-02 13:55:35 ||Fate, everything is necessary?
A meeting (meeting) like being attracted to each other, a connecting story.

Hey, if you can't understand
The pounding in this chest (up to you) ,
Just let it fall like this.

Now choose, let's begin the thrilling date.

I'll never give up these feelings that awaken
As we talk, as we touch, as we laugh.
This is my first time being so honest,
Because I met you and want to be by your side.
I want to believe, Date a Live

Fake, just a misunderstanding?
Fading vertigo (vertigo) , when you feel it it's the end.

Hey, nothing can stop
These rampaging feelings
Once they melt. (it's too late)
Now choose, let us begin the dangerous date
As I Struggle, frustratingly, painfully,
This wish grows, even if it should never
come true.
Because | want to protect
The feelings that saved me, touching your
kind lips.
Let me believe Date a Live.
Like | don't even know how to doubt
(purifying, these feelings with nowhere to go)

I end up accepting everything. (can I look
forward to it?)
The overly-kind you, (though it's just
complicated)
| want to be by your side (supporting you)
Always.
There's no way that there's a right answer
To the intersecting happiness and sadness.
ln this word that doesn't know anything,
just one
Strong, definite thought.
I'll never give up these feelings that awaken
As we talk, as we touch, as we laugh.
This is my first time being so honest,
Because I met you and want to be by your
side
| want to believe Date a Live||

the-dump 2022-02-02 14:16:02 ||This lightly fading, contours, it's almost like, our focus points unify~

The anxiety and pain, that I have kept hidden for all this time, is all entrusted in-to you~
Without hesitation I can go when I'm with you, I can be dedicated when I'm with you
I will be by your side at any time, I know that I can feel it. ^Date A Live^

You kissed me so sweetly once again, at the moment I gently closed my eyes
A line of sight intersecting somewhere, I can never go back to before!

Memories that are just so similar, but different.. I swear, on this sketched scenery
I start to notice the present that's here right now and then, the different future

We meet each other so many times, oh in this constantly revolving world. So Let's begin our ^Date!^

It's like this somewhat weird feeling, that is gently flowing through myself
Don't take these, feelings that look like they'd overflow only upon yourself~
I can overcome if it's with you, I'll show you just because it's you

The real truth,(somewhere), `that I know before touching`. ^Date A Live!^

It lightly changed color once again, the moment we finally touched each other's heart.
The truth goes missing somewhere, did you know, even before we touched?

I don't want to lose this memory. One day, I swear a budded determination
I can't express it well in words but it's a ^certain thing^!

I won't ever give up your warmth, no not in a thousand years ^ So Let's begin our Date^

I'm starting in the past, here only exists now, and this future just might change.
Whatever despair, whatever hope, If only I could be oh just like you who gently smiles~

More than now, for a moment, there can be a world without sorrow..
Even if the irreplaceable wounds heal, don't you ever let these connected hands be ^separated^
…
I just want to protect you who is more dear than anybody else. I just wanna feel alive and ^always by your siiiide^

You kissed me so sweetly once again, at the moment I gently closed my eyes
Somewhere our glances crossed, and from there, we never got to ^return back from before!^

They resemble but they're different memories. I swear, on this sketched out scenery
I start to notice the present that's here right now, and then the changing future~

We meet eachother so many times, oh in this constantly revolving world,  so there's one thing left to do now, ^let's begin our Daaaate~^||

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:42:57 then explain how most laptops have them.
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:43:14 HP Probook 650s G1.

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:44:47 besides, I just want an extra drive that'd mainly be used for games and such, so i can get some load off of the main system drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 15:44:55 and don't say "oh just get an external"

the-dump 2022-02-07 15:49:52 I mean, I could probably bolt an external Hard drive to it

the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:06 200 GB ain't shit
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:00:20 all those are on an external drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:11 I'm aware
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:25 I still play them from time to time
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:01:41 which is why I have them on an external
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:02:09 s t e a m
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:19 uhhhh
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:24 damn...
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:33 15 GB of workshop content
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:03:40 god damn past me, wtf?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:06 is bulky
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:08 yes Ik
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:15 I was goanna put it on the external
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:04:19 but steam had a stroke
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:13 why not just use the current one?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:34 I don't keep photos on my pc
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:05:54 I might invest in Megasync
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:02 I keep those on onedrive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:06:18 why not just.. E x t e n d
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:04 make the case contour to the upgrade
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:12 hehe buzz saw go brrr
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:20 nice joke
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:07:48 bold of you to assume I have a stable income
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:15 anyway
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:29 Ima either invest in hard upgrades, or in a cloud service
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:08:41 I hear Mega has quite a deal with storage
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:01 **ngl this ain't that bad**
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:07 yep
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:26 16 TB is something a laptop user can only dream of
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:46 I'm saying buying an entire new unit
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:52 wait....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:10:57 I'm a dumbass
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:11:22 Bold of you to assume I can program
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:11:55 I have a hard drive from a laptop I dismantled because It failed on me. I might just hook it up and use it as another external or some crap
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:13 Anyway would a network drive be any good?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:20 like, at all?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:31 for example, to have a game stored on?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:13:56 me wanting to upgrade
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:03 trashy SSD moment
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:18 laptop....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:27 I want a more... *perminant* solution
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:14:39 one that... *can't be removed*
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:02 Ayo I just realized
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:23 My laptop has like at least 60% of its case taken by the disk drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:37 I was planning to remove it anyway
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:15:44 why not put the hard drive in there?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:00 I mean, if it fits, it fits
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:18 disk drives typically just, slide out, with laptops
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:16:36 yes because it opens inside my bag and gives me mini heart attacks
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:14 here's the neat part. ***I'm not***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:53 yeah.. I'm a professional....
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:18:58 ***Professional Idiot***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:11 wtf is up with this?
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:42 god damnit microsoft I get youw anna force people to use windows 11, but really? ***Really***
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:58:57 fucking windows system files that's what
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:25 Smoll, trashy SSD that has almost nothing in regards to storage
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:35 237GB is almost nothing at modern day
the-dump 2022-02-07 16:59:52 and considering winsystem takes like, almost 50 gigs
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:00:00 and I can't do shit about it
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:03:17 almost tempted to compress
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:04:35 guys
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:04:39 I found the bastard
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:05:05 and it's still going
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:05:15 what happens if I compress it?
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:10 fun fact
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:18 OS won't let you delet sys32
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:08:54 I got the bastard
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:24 shit
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:34 "Do not compress the windows root directory"
the-dump 2022-02-07 17:10:45 ***Well shit***
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:08:30 I've already handled that..
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:08:43 and uh
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:00 
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:28 btw gmod takes up like, 14 gigs...
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:46 
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:09:52 i'm aware
the-dump 2022-02-07 18:10:36 I already been using that
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:41 okay so
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:44 I found a cloud service
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:51 that gives 1 Terrabyte free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:57 1024 GB
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:49:59 free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:50:02 no catch.
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:50:06 like, god damn
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:51:54 I'm not joking
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:10 I can legit send you a link to it
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:23 so, that, and the fact you can use alts
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:52:50 you can probably get up to 30TB *depending on how determined you are* of storage free
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:53:18 it isn't google drive
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:04 only bad part is...
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:19 it doesn't integrate as a drive.... you have to use the app
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:54:43 so, notice how google drive will integrate itself...
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:55:01 This one, terrabox. Doesn't
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:56:16 'anyway I'm tempted to create 50 gmail accounts to exploit the desktop app for google drive's multiple account feature
the-dump 2022-02-07 20:56:53 hehe
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:54:45 *"We're still gonna keep going forward"
Graphite/diamond
Without looking back*
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:56:33 Yep
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:57:41 What do I believe in.
My chest feels like it's about to burst and now once again, I'm all alone to face this world.
Why should I believe in, the pain is building up into layers just to shackle me down, but there's no time to cry right now...
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:57:52 <@698587744842022983> guess that one
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:18 Shdgdvnakargbd
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:33 Oh lol
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:58:42 Untitled world, Reona
the-dump 2022-02-08 02:59:32 The dry wind passes through (Dead or alive)
The city of forlorn people
My eyes desperate for the light (Dead or alive)
Could only see~ the despair~
My mouth which screams are left unheard~
Seal it with your hand that ^I've been looking for^
In a world where everything is destroyed
I don't know the reason why, I'm still
Scared of the gentleness that you touched me with
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:00:13 Know that one?
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:00:56 Someone's goanna be using google sound search lol
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:02:38 
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:03:04 
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:03:11 E
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:04:45 Hmmm.
Maybe
the-dump 2022-02-08 03:04:59 Ë
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:30:58 Gotta love when pcc roasts the fuck outta of shredder users
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:31:16 That's the one thing that keeps my faith in pcc
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:31:38 Is the fact that most of it, is cultured people.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:33:04 How it feels making custom suspension
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:33:42 Yeah I built that, and it's the best one i built....
Yet, i have no use for it.
😕
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:12 I'm outta ideas for landships..
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:27 And my Explorer class bus is too small to support it
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:34:33 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:35:03 As of last week, it now has legit storms
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:35:41 Stormworks is basically the chad version of plane crazy,  but twice as laggy
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:10 Kuso baka<@159985870458322944>
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:26 Oh so I can cuss you out in Japanese
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:31 But not english
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:36:36 I see how it is
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:37:24 Anyway as I was saying
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:37:44 The reason it be so laggy is because the lead dev can't lead a dev team for crap.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:38:07 He has affectionately been nicknamed deltard by the game's community
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:38:28 *his actual name is deltars*
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:39:17 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:40:47 Goddamn... I just realized
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:41:06 It's been legit ages since I've built a landship in stormworks
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:41:44 Yet, here I am making parts to build a mega one...
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:50:22 I'm not building that
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:00 Still not building it
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:09 Can't convince me
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:26 I'm sticking to my roots of Arknights landships
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:51:50 Well...
I do custom ones but they're heavily inspired by the ones in Arknights
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:05 Specifically the Rhodes Island land cruiser
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:31 As, that's sadly the only one that has concept art.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:52:49 I hope that will change with Prelude to Dawn
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:53:17 Anyway...
Ima send a picture of my newest landship. If I can find it, it's been ages.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:05 Two newest ones..
LS Titan and LS Dalet
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:33 Dalet is the newest one, and it's a 3 story land carrier with an internal hangar
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:54:44 Titan is a 2 story landship interceptor
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:01 Alot faster than Dalet, however the armor on it is VERY light
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:19 I did build one in plane crazy, wanna see?
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:55:34 Ight gimme a sec
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:05 A bit outdated, but still about the same.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:35 She was completely rebuilt for plane crazy 2
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:56:57 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:57:12 Hehe
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:58:37 Anyways...
I would build more.. but uhh
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:58:43 I've kinda got landship burnout
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:05 So currently...
I've been working on a bus.
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:12 
the-dump 2022-02-08 06:59:30 Le storm chaser
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:04 It did its purpose for storm chasing, although with legit all tornados being the same, there's no point in chasing them.
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:27 However, I'm working on converting it to a Terrain Explorer
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:00:52 Meaning it could climb mountains and shit like that
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:01:28 *I mean, the chaser can do that already,  but it's kinda weird bc of the mechanisms for the storm probe*
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:01:50 Uh
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:02:01 And here I thought what I did was cursed
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:02:44 Hehe nyoom
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:10 I have yet to do a photoshoot of the modern version
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:34 .....
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:03:52 I will fite you with a landship, and run you over
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:13 Or would you prefer to be smacked by a tornado probe?
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:37 Bet
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:04:48 You can if there are no witnesses
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:16 Le controls
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:35 Exactly
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:05:54 Nah. Just smack the pregnant person with their own featus...
*wait*
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:06:14 Featus deleatus
the-dump 2022-02-08 07:06:54

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:15:11 Btw this entire landship is heavily inspired by the Rhodes Island landship from Arknights
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:16:02 Anyway, it's big
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:16:39 Ironic enough, my landship has a radar *fake, but it's actually ready for a real one*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:16:49 Listen here you little shi-
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:17:31 Lemme see if I can find a screenshot with the radar in frame...

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:19:19 Cannon spam will be the new shredder
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:20:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:20:46 Cutters are basically either for detail, or for cringe
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:20:53 Ayo wtf
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:21:36 Tbh
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:21:53 If the cutter was never added, would the shredder bug ever been built?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:22:07 Too close to stormworks

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:26:42 Charging up AA Ion cannons

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:31:31 But the angle, and timing of that picture makes it looks otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:31:54 ~~totally didn't cut the mech's balls off~~

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:46:57 These are landships, we just call them cruisers because roblox hates "landship"

Is it really though?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 22:58:16 You have a point.
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:00:13 
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:00:27 This, is PCC's weakness
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:01:09 Fight fire with fire
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:01:30 Anyways
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:01:35 You all fell for my trap
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:02:25 Never would've guessed
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:06:04 We're no strangers to love, you know the rules, and so do I
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:06:30 A full on commitment's what I'm thinking of.
You wouldn't get this from any other guy..
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:06:49 I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling, just wanna make you understand.
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:07:04 *never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:07:21 *never gonna run around, and desert you*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:07:56 *never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye, never gonna tell a lie, or hurt you*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:08:27 Shut
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:08:36 They ship land.
*some can, and do*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:09:54 But are you immune to this?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:12:51 Some landships are capable of carrying land, and therefore would be coated by said land, so in theory yes, some are in fact made of land.
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:21:13 Most landships, being constructed, and plated using steel, iron, and keel, all of which come from a planet's crust, which which would then count as being made of land.
So therefore,  landships are made of land.
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:22:22 It comes from dirt
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:23:15 I was about to say that to jab at lucian
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:23:23 Are Space ships made of space?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:23:28 Are cargo ships made of cargo?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:23:33 Are airships made of air?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:23:54 Then a landship is a ship on land
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:25:10 I mean,mining ones technically are
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:25:21 And, RILS is a mining landship
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:25:23 Case closed
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:38:22 No
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:49:31 Whitelist
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:52:23 No
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:55:25 Rhodes Island Landship was a former mining landship which was repurposed into a headquarters after it was found in an abandoned mine during the Kazdel Civil War.The mine, formerly owned and run by RIM Billiton industries,  had been used primarily to excavate pure crystalline Originium, to power the intense energy needs of the world,  and also using said originium to power it's own operations.
The landship itself was escorted out of the mine, and through an active battlefield, and piloted by an organization then called *Babel* which would later become Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals, taking its name after the landship they're based in.
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:57:18 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:57:26 I typed that out myself
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:57:30 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:57:57 *technically it's from Fandom*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:58:13 It's *IN* the land
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:58:24 Well. It *was*
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:58:28 When it was found
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:58:40 It's a mining landship
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 23:58:54 And I don't think naming something a landminor is a good idea

the-dump 2022-02-22 03:51:37 Me and my gf just exchanged memes for 40 minutes straight...
Yeah she's a keeper
the-dump 2022-02-22 03:51:59 She do be cultured
the-dump 2022-02-22 03:52:24 
the-dump 2022-02-22 03:53:12 
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:02:14 Who else remembers *Shake it Up* ?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:03:30 Accurate
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:06:50 Yes
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:02 Such as letting someone choose their gender
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:11 That's for biology to decide
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:38 Exactly
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:07:58 Although, gender swap surgery exists....
So there's that
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:34 Yeah
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:40 Some people need to just cope
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:09:58 Anyone?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:10:28 Scroll up
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:12:41 Physically, not really
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:13:21 This is what I was referring to
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:14:13 Dun fact.
There is actually only 3 genders,  eith the 3rd one being exceptionally rare
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:14:59 Male, Female, and Nonbinary. 
This is caused by a rare mutation causing the child to have both female, and male reproductive organs, which also causes them to become infertile.
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:15:48 It's called science
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:53:21 no, the person themselves are infertle, meaning they literally cannot *'do the deed'* or else their hormones would cause their body ho have a stroke
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:55:47 I'm just saying, biologically non bianary people are the 'inspiratio' beinind this whole mess, so they can promptly go screw themselves... 

*w a i t, I didn't mean it like that*
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:57:39 okay <@!192861290677534722> so, how many genders are there?
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:57:42 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:24 2
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:40 according to science, only 2 1/2 genders exist
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:58:54 Science never lies
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:01 nor does statistics
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:25 *yes*
the-dump 2022-02-22 13:59:42 but still, all these other 34 genders can <a:SHUT:874923284850966528>
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:07 oh so nonbianary is genderless now?
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:13 seems legit
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:00:42 Anyway, am I just old, or does **anyone** else here remember the old disney shows? Like Shake it Up, or ANT farm, or JEssie
the-dump 2022-02-22 14:12:30 *bring the lights up, bust the doors down, dust yourself off, Shake it Up, Shake it Up!*
the-dump 2022-02-22 17:26:33 *The show may be trash, but the intros can be fire.*

the-dump 2022-03-01 06:04:51 The fact I basically did a poem instead of saying

the-dump 2022-03-01 15:09:13 Wait, that actually aired?
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:18:37 Stormworks is a better version of plane crazy, while being more broken at the same time.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:19:43 Plane crazy is more stable than SW, bu it has less features than SW.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:36 True..
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:43 Although each game has its advantages
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:47 For example
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:20:59 Stormworks has copy paste, multi build,  and logic
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:21:21 Plane crazy has pvp,simple mechanics, and runs more stable *most of the time*
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:21:55 While stormworks has pvp mechanics, the weapons are modular and would be more difficult to understand than the ones in plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:23:32 It all comes down to preference
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:23:45 Those who prefer more simpler mechanics would go to plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:02 Those who want full control, and more advan6building would go to stormworks
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:17 Myself personally,  I prefer both
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:44 Although I prefer the building style of stormworks over plane crazy
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:48 Mainly because
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:24:54 It has multi place
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:06 U can make a big wall with one clicc

the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:42 I actually had plans for that chassis
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:49 But now it's just...
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:54 No plans.
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:25:57 Yes
the-dump 2022-03-01 15:26:29 It was going to be the base frame for 3 modular landships, that would be capablr of docking together to create a mega landship
the-dump 2022-03-01 20:31:30 Taht is only because I was testing the chassis, there were no engines yet
the-dump 2022-03-01 20:31:50 Actually to increase surface area, but I guess top speed works too
the-dump 2022-03-01 23:19:09 Treads have no collisions, therefore why I added the wheels

the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:08 Non binary,  in which either none, or one of the reproductive organs will be functional. 
It is impossible for the human body to have both organs still functional, as it's only designed to handle one, and the hormones from both at the same time would cause mental failure.
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:38 Estrogen, is very strong as a hormone
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:21:43 So is testosterone
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:02 If they're in equal amounts in an individual,  that wouldn't end well
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:22:11 I just freaking said what would happen

the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:17 You can't tell me, corona is natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:28 It's literally showing all signs of being artificial
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:48 If it was natural...
Explain how it evolved at least 10 times already?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:25:52 That ain't natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:04 In 2 years?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:09 10 strands come out?
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:26 So that's like, 5 evolutions per year
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:30 That ain't natural
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:34 And if it is
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:26:37 We're screwed
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:16 When
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:49 I'd imagine it was the Korea, and they sent it to china
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:27:55 Specifically,  North Korea
the-dump 2022-03-06 04:28:11 The fatty Kim there would be the person to do that anyways

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:29:56 2 le turrets
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:30:27 They were built for aesthetic,  so they don't function that well
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:40:57 Not a repost if there's something new.
Look on the roof
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:41:07 Like, legit look on the roof
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:41:28 Eh, forced perspective cut off the rest of the improvements
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:41:45 I finally managed to bypass the stroke chat filter to fix the nameplate
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:42:15 It now says **Rhodes** Island. 
Instead of *Rhode Island*
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:42:36 Well...
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:42:46 In actuality it says Rhode§
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:42:54 I had also redone the radars
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:43:02 And cleaned up the interior a bit
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:43:19 *screenshot not available*
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:43:28 And I refuse to get back on
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:43:50 Let's just say I removed a massive hallway and now one of the decks is hella open now
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:44:19 Dunno, might make a giant cannon in place of the helipad
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:44:29 Been needing to remove it anyway
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:10 But, can you make these in stormworks?
*(Stormworks is plane crazy but more advanced)*
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:23 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:42 I plan to
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:50 Detailing requires time
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:53 And planning
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:45:58 But who tf plans shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:46:01 I don't
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:46:19 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:46:27 Just too lazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:46:41 I've planned tons of things in the past that I have no ideas anymore
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:46:56 Designer's burnout
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:47:06 Thing is, I've done it already
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:47:10 All of em
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:47:24 .
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:47:35 Listen hers you little shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:48:05 Actually,  I was working on something like this in stormworks
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:48:22 Gave up, because I realized I jo longe rhave inspiration.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:48:30 The mechanisms are there for it
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:48:37 I just can't make the hulls.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:49:03 Bruh legit everything on my landships is custom.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:49:24 I'm like, 1 of 4 people on stormworks who makes landships
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:49:36 What if they can swim?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:50:11 One of my landships doubles as an ocean crawler
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:50:19 It legit can cruise under the sea
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:50:56 That model is obsolete
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:51:13 Now, it's the modular class landships
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:51:46 Landships capable of docking together to create a larger, more powerful mega cruiser.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:51:55 They haven't been built yet tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:52:16 The bare frame is almost complete
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:52:22 But I lost motivation
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:52:26 And inspiration
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:52:30 Hell
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:52:39 Nah.

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 07:54:00 Other than the suspension

Last weekend I went over to her house...
I had planned for us to watch either Up or WALL-E
the-dump 2022-04-06 06:36:32 But, disney pulled all their films from all streaming services

Both of us are hyped

the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:27 I have a big kiss planned...
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:48 So.
At the end of season 3, there's a scene of a kiss that's REALLY exaggerated
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:07:57 From there, I kiss her
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:08:07 Potentially..

the-dump 2022-04-06 07:15:41 Anyway
the-dump 2022-04-06 07:15:46 The key to this

the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:19 That one statement was a lie
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:36 Everything else however, is truth
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:05:46 You have a point
the-dump 2022-04-06 22:06:04 That makes no sense

the-dump 2022-04-27 01:06:32 actually, while survivalcraft came out after minecraft, it can be argued that SC2 is better than Minecraft
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:06:48 Each has advantages over the other
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:13:14 yeah. they ported to windows 10
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:18:40 I never encountered any whales
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:18:55 did you find out where it came from, or did it despawn?
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:21:02 I found this massive room. it even has an echo
the-dump 2022-04-27 01:21:09 wonder if there are lights

the-dump 2022-04-30 04:59:33 Ok so I got a question...
So a certain social media app has found one of my long lost friends that I've been out of contact with since he switched schools in the 5th grade. *(we're both in high school now)* should I reestablish contact?
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:00:11 Or, should I just let the old times die out?
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:22:17 Advice taken
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:22:49 I shall attempt recommunication in the morning
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:46:43 Fuck no
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:47:16 If anything I'm going to send him 2 pictures.  One of chicken noodle soup, and another of a loaf of bread
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:47:33 When we were younger, we had a joke regarding that
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:50:25 If he remembers this, I shall attempt reconnection
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:50:47 If not, I'll try a few more measures... if that fails I'll bid him well and depart
the-dump 2022-04-30 05:53:55 Heh

the-dump 2022-05-03 00:30:51 I just want to slap myself before shit went downhill
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:31:36 Seems however,  I'm only capable of fucking shit up. So it wouldn't matter anyway..

the-dump 2022-05-03 00:33:05 I fucked shit up..
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:33:50 I've gotta see her in person tomorrow at school, to explain everything out.. I doubt I'll be able to keep myself together..
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:34:20 So that being said
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:34:30 Anybody got a working time machine?
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:35:05 So I can go back and slap myself before I fucked shit up.
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:35:56 Then again. I was just diagnosed with severe anxiety today because of all what happened
the-dump 2022-05-03 00:36:40 Then again.. that doesn't matter

the-dump 2022-05-04 05:11:45 Turns out it wasn't anything near what I thought
the-dump 2022-05-04 05:12:25 Turns out, she sensed something was off, and told her parents because she was worried about me. Her parents told mine. And now I'm getting the help I was too scared to ask for

the-dump 2022-05-04 06:37:29 No,she knew something was up as my anxiety was spinning out of control and I was going borderline suicidal
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:09 So, her parents want us apart until my emotional state stabilize
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:30 I'm on anxiety meds now
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:38:42 Had a massive breakdown last night..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:12 Thinking that her parents were turning her against me,that she was going to break up with me..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:35 As it turns out.. her parents are genuinely worried about me..
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:39:45 I tell you,first impressions ARE everything
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:19 So anyway...
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:28 Since I lost myself over text
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:40 We both can't text eachother for the time being
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:40:54 Let things "cool down"
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:41:37 I'm told that I shouldn't talk to her even if I see her when I go back to school....
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:41:52 I'm almost convinced it's a restraining order ;-;
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:18 But, no legal evidence of one
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:44 Yes I'm aware
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:42:58 Her parents are kinda overprotective anyways
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:11 It's like midnight
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:29 Yeah
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:43:45 Honestly... this feels wrong.. but I miss her 😔
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:04 HOL UP
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:23 WAIT A MINUTE
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:44:33 1
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:45:13 This is why I'm forced to be away from her. Because everything just broke that I've been holding back.. and my anxiety spun out of control
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:05 Heh.. out of spite I watched the next episode of the show we were watching together...
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:26 I'll fucking do it again when the next one comes out
the-dump 2022-05-04 06:46:50 No

the-dump 2022-05-12 09:15:40 What.. you think she's hot?
I mean,her single engine does overwork the radiator at full power
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:15:51 That's why the booster car exists you know
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:16:30 I know how to de-escelate simps
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:16:42 Oh... interesting
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:17:01 I can assist you with getting over it
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:17:24 That is,if you're interested
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:17:53 No. Like literally I can help you
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:18:01 I know ways of changing the mindset
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:18:26 Although I've found it difficult to use on myself, it works on others... and I've helped others in this way.
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:18:47 Aight aight...
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:19:08 Then how about the HTI HLV-M4 blowing her casing then, hmm?
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:19:35 Ironically,  that happened alot in the prototype stage
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:20:02 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:11 Festive excursion
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:39 HTI trying to put that old steamer outta business so we started the Arctic Express
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:21:55 Bam
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:22:01 Raw. Power.
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:22:33 A perfect balance in diesel, and perpetual technology...
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:23:21 Accidents do happen though
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:23:35 Sadly not possible in stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:07 Because no
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:18 Hover tech is VERY finicky
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:36 I've experimented with it before.. and it always crashes to the ground
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:24:42 *literally*
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:25:12 Lonk
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:25:40 I'm aware of my reasons and you don't need to know them
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:01 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:05 Go ahear
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:24 I disobey that avoid self harm part
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:38 I am getting help though
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:26:55 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:27:19 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:27:47 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:28:03 Failure..
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:28:08 It's a factor of engineering
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:29:16 
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:30:47 Ah yes. The prototype
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:30:50 Back when it was a freighter
the-dump 2022-05-12 09:31:08 Had to dig real deep to find these
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:24:16 AP2?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:24:50 What is this AP2 you speak of?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:25:02 Ohhh that
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:25:52 Probably not
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:26:15 Not the case...
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:26:39 As PC2 would be receiving active updates, and pc1 would be left obsolete and broken in the long run
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:26:53 We all know how roblox breaks shit
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:29:15 Why yall fighting about pc2
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:29:22 It ain't coming out anytime soon
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:29:47 Billy
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:29:56 Just <a:SHUT:874923284850966528>
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:30:48 That being said, how much you know about the map, might I ask some questions in dm or no?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:31:33 EVERYONE SHUT
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:31:46 WHETHER A GAME IS "GOOD" IS SUBJECTIVE TO THE PERSON
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:32:33 Hey <@908466749106683996> you said you know some stuff regarding pc2, might i ask some questions?
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:23:32 H
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:24:28 This is it now
the-dump 2022-05-14 05:30:48 Humpback landship
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:54:14 
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:54:38 
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:55:01 Stormbrokes. 
I mean stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-14 21:58:03 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-15 00:19:35 
the-dump 2022-05-15 01:07:37 
the-dump 2022-05-16 21:54:58 
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:07:16 
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:07:56 Pain
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:09:33 I dunno
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:09:44 H
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:57:45 Yes
the-dump 2022-05-16 22:58:14 
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:45:30 Spooder
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:54:07 <@471802613168603173> hey old buddy
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:58:46 Ay
the-dump 2022-05-17 02:59:39 Landship drift
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:26:39 I have to use window mode
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:29:09 Headlights
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:34:56 
the-dump 2022-05-17 04:34:58 Hehe
the-dump 2022-05-17 10:54:30 <a:Ammogus:891573881117237298>
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:11:49 Too bad
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:12:29 
the-dump 2022-05-17 11:12:32 Flashbang
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:29:58 Landship burnout.
*(the bow got wedged under the bridge)*
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:30:39 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:30:55 I'm just forced to use windowed mode now, since my pc is aging
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:31:00 Well,laptop
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:31:32 
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:32:02 Obviously needs bright lights, since it is a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:25 I mean
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:33 There's also the headlights..
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:33:44 But they're on a daylight sensor
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:03 The lights on that picture are the manual rooflights.
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:12 
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:28 Be careful what you wish for <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:40 Wha
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:34:54 ..
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:13 I am limited by the technology of my time
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:29 No
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:45 I'm not adding more lights for multiple reasons
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:35:58 1.I refuse to build more light mounts
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:13 2. My pc can barely handle the lights it has already
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:29 3. With all the lights on at once,  it's blinding enough already
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:36:48 There's 4 sets of headlights, only 2 of which are wired up
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:15 Not possible
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:31 Stormworks has its limits
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:37:49 Anyway
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:38:33 Can't mount that on a landship
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:38:47 It simply doesn't exist in game
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:16 Although,  I could use a modded light and break the game with its brightness
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:37 I've done it before
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:39:44 And stormworks doesn't like it
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:40:54 Rain never stopped a landship before.
And wet mountains are no match for an exploration class landship.
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:41:12 Small picture
the-dump 2022-05-17 16:52:49 You wish it was pc2
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:19 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:30 It is stormworks
the-dump 2022-05-17 18:45:37 Because yes
the-dump 2022-05-17 19:15:08 Because I can't afford a "proper" gaming computer
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:37:53 Nice virus <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:42:49 But you can only weld organic conpounds
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:05 Lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:35 Lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:43:58 I was thinking like living tissue but that works too
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:17 I meant weld
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:32 Yes I did
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:40 OHHH
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:44:47 I misunderstood lol
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:16 Welding organic compounds
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:42 You're a master of welding organic compounds together.
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:45:48 You figure it out
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:11 
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:36 Indeed
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:46:47 
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:48:34 Guys guess what
the-dump 2022-05-17 23:48:48 Get flashbanged
the-dump 2022-05-18 09:39:52 Why'd that song become a meme again?
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:14 Under da sea
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:14 
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:29 ..
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:39 Because
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:50:41 I can
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:12 How do you know it wasn't to trigger people? <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:40 Nah they flat now
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:47 
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:51:51 Ran em over
the-dump 2022-05-20 03:52:13 Bruh momwnt
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:27:25 Okay so
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:27:34 It's official
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:28:05 Nautica is classed. Exploration class.
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:28:57 We all wish that was pc2
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:49:10 It's the headlights isn't it?
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:13 Nautica can still plow you down you know
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:37 
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:50:48 Good
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:51:01 Nautica is built for hazardous environments anyway
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:51:26 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-20 07:53:26 Nani?
the-dump 2022-05-20 15:27:45 Ayo that stern don't lie tho
the-dump 2022-05-20 21:49:27 I bet I can piss off at least 2 people here with two words
the-dump 2022-05-21 20:27:59 
the-dump 2022-05-22 02:10:29 Wherever you go, there you are 
-library of babel
the-dump 2022-05-22 04:09:51 
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:44:41 Okeh
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:44:42 So
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:45:13 LS Nautica has been moved to Franxx class.. with the merger between exploration and franxx class...
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:45:38 My next landship. LS Demon, will be the second in the franxx class. Being designated FX-002
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:06 *subtle but obvious zerotwo reference*
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:35 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:46:54 .
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:07 Meh
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:13 Nah
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:25 Hehe
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:47:57 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:48:43 I've gotta figure out how to make horns look good on a landship...
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:48:57 Since, LS Demon is going to be somewhat modeled after Zerotwo
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:49:18 Color scheme will be.. at least
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:49:51 However, it's going to be difficult to make Demon, since I've gotta engineer new tech for it
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:50:22 What
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:50:32 What
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:16 I'm making a landship in reference to zerotwo
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:29 It's the second in the Franxx class landships
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:51:50 Yes, I have the chance and I'm taking it
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:52:04 Why?
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:53:14 You didn't answer the question
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:53:44 The Franxx class is planned to have 3 ships.
LS Nautica.
LS Demon.
And LS Hiro.
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:22 LS Demon,  and LS Hiro are references to two characters from Darling in the Franxx
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:34 Nautica is basically a numerical placeholder
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:54:57 F
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:11 Demon might have an ara ara hidden on the back bumper.. idk yet
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:33 LS Demon is still in the concept phase
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:55:55 .
the-dump 2022-05-22 15:56:33 LS Nautica's stern.

the-dump 2022-05-31 02:14:25 Multi-player does exist, but it's shit

the-dump 2022-06-04 17:00:05 I mean,  he's not wrong
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:00:29 But,what about the 4th state of matter?
*plasma*
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:05 I'm talking about the gas plasma
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:09 Ionized air
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:47 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:01:49 Discord
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:08 *Discord by definition means disagreement*
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:11 Little fun fact
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:02:39 Another little fun fact..
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:03:05 Apparently squids like traumatizing landships
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:03:55 I wonder how many krakens Nautica can handle at once before the breakers pop
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:02 You wish
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:25 Because screw physics
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:04:52 Explain how a multiple ton landship gets sent flying through the air
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:05:30 Or how the God damn kraken learned to fly
the-dump 2022-06-04 17:06:04 
the-dump 2022-06-04 18:02:13 Indeed
the-dump 2022-06-04 19:02:16 Yes..
the-dump 2022-06-04 19:02:20 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:29:18 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:29:34 Say ara ara backwards
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:30:38 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:30:55 ara ara backwards is *~Ara Ara~*
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:37:07 
the-dump 2022-06-04 20:51:15 
the-dump 2022-06-05 01:31:47 *~Ara Ara~*
the-dump 2022-06-05 03:37:00 *ara ara*
the-dump 2022-06-05 06:07:18 All three of my *Franxx* class landships
**HTI-HVD:FX-001** "Nautica" *(Project "Stealthcrawler")*
**HTI-HVD:FX-002** "Demon" *(Project "Zerotwo")*
**HTI-HVD:FX-003** "Hiro" *(Project "Weeabo")*
the-dump 2022-06-05 06:07:52 The names are in fact intentional
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:04:17 Look at the codename for Demon
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:04:20 <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-05 07:58:13 
the-dump 2022-06-05 08:39:37 
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:11:21 
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:11:33 Animated
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:14:58 It worked as intended
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:16:24 Ara ara
the-dump 2022-06-05 09:55:50 
the-dump 2022-06-05 17:28:28 I did a thing
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:23 Lights on, Lights off
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:29 Redid the nameplates
the-dump 2022-06-05 19:59:58 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:21:10 How'd I do?
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:22:31 I think the blue can go..darker.
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:22:45 They aren't interlaping
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:03 That's kinda tricky, given my level of skill with these
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:18 This is not plane crazy
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:41 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:23:45 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:10 About that
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:17 The red X is at the edge
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:24:33 Can't do that..
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:25:56 Should I go darker on the blue X?
*I took the glow off of it just now*
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:31:47 
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:32:08 Ayo the nameplate looks hella good with bloom on
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:32:34 Thanks
the-dump 2022-06-05 21:35:30 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:31:31 
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:27 The landship is fully my own design. The landship class is named after Darling in the Franxx, This ship in particular is named after the fact it was originally a sea crawler.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:49 Also.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:32:58 Why not?
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:19 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:26 Regardless,Franxx class is here to stay
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:33:43 Mainly because the nameplates are so easy to make <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:15 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:25 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:50:38 My opinion? I'm inspired by the Franxx units.
the-dump 2022-06-05 22:52:56 Pfft
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:31:54 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:34:02 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:34:22 Attempted replica
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:38:57 Huh...
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:39:21 Well shit now I can't unsee it
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:40:55 ...
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:18 Well
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:25 The resemblance is there
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:41:43 Although, it's unintentional,  I cannot deny it looks like that
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:43:06 
the-dump 2022-06-06 00:43:49 What?
the-dump 2022-06-06 01:06:30 No you. Because I personally like it
the-dump 2022-06-06 02:45:30 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-06 04:09:34 
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:42:30 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:43:01 Which looks better? *the tracks*
the-dump 2022-06-06 17:43:22 BTW top two are the same thing
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:23:54 Stormworks
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:48:19 Redid them again
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:49:16 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-06 18:49:24 The dump is where I get the most reaction
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:12:41 I'd say so
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:13:12 H
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:12 Nautica as a whole took around 2 or 3 weeks
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:20 And it's too small to fit drones
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:15:53 There's emergency exits on the roof
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:02 Survival, creative...
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:06 Both gamemodes
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:20 Editor
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:32 Not like plane crazy
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:16:44 It's the opposite of plane crazy building
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:33 It's an Editor for building
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:41 BTW that's the back nameplate
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:18:51 
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:19:17 
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:05 No
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:16 But the landship after it will
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:20:41 Doesn't exist un game
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:22:25 Can't do that
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:26:33 When you piss off a Franxx class landship
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:27:15 The landship?
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:27:24 LS Nautica
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:41:24 LS Demon will have turrets
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:08 Shut
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:19 You just toxic because you can't build one <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-06 19:42:54 Everyone has an opinion
the-dump 2022-06-06 20:55:13 
the-dump 2022-06-06 21:11:35 Truly menacing
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:00:06 Called updates
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:00:23 You perfect one build before moving onto another
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:01:54 Oh yeah, this is pcc, so nobody will care anyway
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:02:12 It's just fun seeing you all get triggered over the anime references I put on these things
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:11 That being said
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:38 Yep
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:03:56 Meh
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:04:07 Is it wrong to be proud of your own creation?
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:04:43 Nobody said it's a personality
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:04 Nah
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:19 I go off of a lot of things
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:43 Just sometimes I feel like pissing pcc off
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:05:50 And guess what, it worked <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:10:11 Controlled chaos
the-dump 2022-06-06 22:11:16 You happy now?

the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:13 As I said. Relatively wide
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:22 That's the old picture
the-dump 2022-06-07 02:29:35 Vs the new one

the-dump 2022-06-07 12:46:56 It's animated
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:47:29 Though. I might switch it to a group photo of my landships once I finish Franxx class
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:47:40 No, like legit look at my profile
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:02 It's a POV of being hit by my Arctic Express train
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:16 Anyway..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:48:24 Sanity is declining

the-dump 2022-06-07 12:49:08 However..

the-dump 2022-06-07 12:51:45 Designing takes me back to a time when there was no pain
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:02 However... it seems it's getting out of hand..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:39 The Franxx class was supposed to be a landship class to let my iner weeb run free to revert my mind to the state it was in before I started dating *her*
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:52:53 However.... it seems it backfired..
And now I'm losing my shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:30 Tried that
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:53:35 Isolation makes things worse

the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:08 Mostly now, I just use it as background noise
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:27 I haven't watched anime in a good 2 weeks..
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:35 I do that too...
the-dump 2022-06-07 12:54:43 But regardless..

the-dump 2022-06-07 13:01:43 However. The past is history, what's done is done and there's no changing it..
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:02:14 I can actually push my glasses using my facial muscles
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:02:21 No joke

the-dump 2022-06-07 13:11:59 *something keeps stopping me when I try though.. some invisible force*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:15 The world is unforgiving
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:32 We're nothing but specs
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:12:49 In the end. Nothing we do matters...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:13:14 Oh to be a frog on a log with not a care in the world
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:13:41 That gave me a stroke
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:14:34 I'm going back to sleep. I hope I can sleep for 30 years...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:15:14 ...
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:15:49 Sometimes I wish my landships were real so i could run things over with them
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:16:09 *they have plows for a reason*
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:16:47 Ehhhh you might be right... those things are heavy as fuck
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:19:58 The evidence will remain on the bumper. My lamdships can detach their plows and bumpers
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:20:20 ***dents***
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:20:41 A person dents a car by alot if you hit them

the-dump 2022-06-07 13:21:26 ..
the-dump 2022-06-07 13:21:50 I'm going back to sleep,to see how long my body will let me sleep before my biological clock kicks in..
the-dump 2022-06-07 14:20:47 It seems my biological clock kicked in because I can't sleep any longer 😔
the-dump 2022-06-07 17:24:35 Demon mode <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-07 17:44:17 Shut
the-dump 2022-06-07 19:51:57 F
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:07:33 .... listen here you little shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:40:01 Yup
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:40:27 Deforestation is fun
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:40:49 Oop
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:41:01 I've never seen it referred to like that
the-dump 2022-06-07 20:42:44 I mean, she do be kinda blocky. Ngl
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:17 Highly considered
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:31 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:28:41 Ayo
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:29:16 Wha
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:29:42 It's considered for the next ship in the Franxx class. Nautica is too small for one
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:10 No
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:23 Way too small to need an elevator
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:30:41 Way too small for that
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:31:04 .
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:31:09 Did I stutter?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:30 ...
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:33 You do realize
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:32:40 This is a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:15 
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:35 Wha
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:43 It's on the workshop
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:33:51 I can't screen record because my pc is shit
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:34:36 Adding airborne propulsion <:trol:916591571963629608>
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:01 It's both
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:17 Nautica is a landship, that can operate as a submarine, or a sea crawler
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:34 And, if I can get this right...
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:36 An aircraft
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:35:50 Yes
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:13 Wha?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:17 No
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:26 Nautica is not designed for cargo
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:38:35 However, LS Hiro will be a carrier landship
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:46:19 O
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:46:36 Lmfao it's trying so hard to flip back over
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:53:02 What do you think is trying to flip it?
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:54:34 So I added some offset to the pivot for the flip beams
the-dump 2022-06-07 21:54:41 And it works
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:34 Man screw society
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:42 Also screw physics
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:26:51 Become uncontrollable
the-dump 2022-06-08 00:30:22 Oop
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:37:25 Depressed. And losing my shit
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:38:06 The breakup is what's wrong... the past keeps coming back
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:38:48 I hope I find someone senior year,  or at least soon..
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:04 😔
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:09 I'm aware of that
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:39:48 I've taken up anime, and becoming embedded into designing landships as a coping method...
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:40:45 Both of which have failed me
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:06 ..
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:09 What?
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:21 Can't a person be honest?
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:37 Jeez sometimes I wish I could yeet my emotions to brazil
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:47 Become emotionless
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:42:50 But no.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:43:01 Heartbreak shakes me to my core
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:43:44 Like an earthquake breaking the ground, similarly this is breaking my mind.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:08 No
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:20 I ironically do that when I'm stressed
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:44:56 Le fishe
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:46:12 I don't know why I even bother hoping things will get better.
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:46:23 Truth is, they probably won't
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:47:06 I might as well just stop fighting... and just give in to the thoughts until they bring my demise
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:48:38 I have. And it doesn't work
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:49:12 *the void grows deeper,and deeper pulling at the faint strands that are left of my will to live*
the-dump 2022-06-08 02:49:51 I don't know why I even try anymore

the-dump 2022-06-08 22:15:09 That wasn't a joke though

the-dump 2022-07-11 22:41:15 Come over here beside me. My restraint crumbles.
Just Don’t you fear me now~

Ah~

A flightless bird dreamed of the sky.
The colors mixing there are a different kind of red.~

I covered my ears to the sound of knocking on my door.
Is that you knocking? Or is it some other?~

Will your lips taste the kiss of death?

Darling, fate runs through my veins
As this world begins to move …is it love?~

I want to melt like no one has before, Darling.
So don’t fear me, just kiss me now!

I want to taste you …does that make me weird?

It’s something we’re unable to feel all alone.

Embracing one another will keep our wounds sealed,
So I’ll seal your breath with my lips.

Will your lips taste the kiss of death?
Darling, what is this melting feeling I feel
From the beating of my heart to the tips of my fingers? 

Hey…
Come over here beside me. My restraint crumbles.

So don’t fear me, just kiss me now, my love!~

I felt something like the moment of death~
With your taste.

Did your lips taste the kiss of death? (Death, Death~)

Darling, fate runs through my veins
As this world begins to move …is it love?

I want to melt like no one has before, Darling.

So don’t fear me, 
Let me taste you,oh just kiss me now!
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:41:32 Hehe
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:42:33 Yes
the-dump 2022-07-11 22:43:08 Inexperienced
Heartless
But even so
Be beautiful

No destiny, unworthy
If we just talk as if it's never enough
"If it's like this then probably things will go well"
Things, money, love, words
I'm tired of self-asserting myself already
Déjà vu, what are you so unsatisfied about?
You've said all sorts of selfish things
What more could you possibly want?
But surprise, I don't hate this situation
Already, "I'm sick of hearing that line"
The one thing I don't want is ambiguousness

Enough
Even if you say to do this or that
Even if you say you love me or why?
It's easy if it's just for fun
And that it's reckless serious negotiating
Those contemptuous and surprising words
How many times do you want to use?
Anyway
I was hoping it even in a fixed game

Even all those quoted phrases
Those words make people tiptoe
Let these things become taboo
Take a hint, don't let it rain

I hate talking in a roundabout way
If you must speak, "Answer it within two words"
Red butterfly, even a letter can not be served
Spreading a fragile folding fan
That is more attractive, isn't it?

Confused
If you can't answer, please leave me alone
The key words, but you don't listen
If it is only for the sake of peace of mind and then fall
Sweet raindrops
You also want to hold up the umbrella, right?
Like this
I hope I can always look forward to it
I closed my eyes
I wanted to change
Pretending to be an adult
Lost
But things are irreparable
Now, please don't stop raining

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:20:06 Okay i might be fucked up. But I'm not that fucked up
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:20:58 Literally me with cat litter

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:37:28 I've started dating for like the 4th time
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:15 ..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:51 Hey guys
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:38:56 I have a theory
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:02 So. Fish..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:18 To them, the surface is what they perceive as space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:23 They can't breathe
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:26 They can't survive
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:38 On the surface, there are animals that survive
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:41 IE Us
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:44 So what if
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:39:49 There were animals in space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:04 That we just can't see because we're looking wrong
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:21 No, like they could somehow breathe.  Think Fish out of water
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:40:37 I had that idea at work 💀
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:41:07 I had a shower thought washing golfcarts lmao
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:41:25 I should pitch that idea to nasa lol
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:42:27 Screw you I can drift a landship
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:43:44 See. That's the theory
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:00 Think of a Fish, versus Us
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:11 We have a different organ structure to survive on the surface
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:16 Compared to a fish k water
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:25 Nono hear me out
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:38 Now what if..
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:42 These creatures
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:44:54 Hitched a ride on the satellites we sent up into space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:45:11 And are just hiding on the side we can't see (the side that faces away from earth)
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:45:51 One would think that youd be able to see it with another one right? Wrong.  They're so far apart you can barely see them even from the SS
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:06 Also so small by comparison
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:46:27 It sounds like a shower thought

the-dump 2022-07-12 01:47:43 But compleatly evolved for the vacuum of space
the-dump 2022-07-12 01:48:00 Wait.. what would that look like?
