The Tale of .andrewwx (686667466038182174)
general 2022-01-15 15:41:37 hello
general 2022-01-15 15:55:32 i just lost 2 hours of progress on the plane i was working on
general 2022-01-15 15:56:11 its a special plane to me lol its a drawing i designed it during class out of boredom to be a rival to the an124
general 2022-01-15 15:57:31 i got a lot of my progress back already
general 2022-01-15 15:58:22 time to figure out the rudder
general 2022-01-15 15:58:37 because its a an225 style rudder its gonna be different to build
general 2022-01-15 15:59:24 lol
general 2022-01-15 15:59:27 yeah
general 2022-01-15 16:02:04 yo im sorry bout asking this but i cant find information in any of the channels but how can i get image perms to send stuff in <#504436696021204992>
general 2022-01-15 16:03:49 *
general 2022-01-15 16:04:27 ah ok makes sense
general 2022-01-15 16:15:46 i figured out a system for the rudders
general 2022-01-15 16:16:01 gonna be different from the an225 ofc because its supposed to be unique
general 2022-01-15 16:18:08 wait if i use a camera fold am i just gonna have to deal with the random motor connected to my build or is there a way i can make it invisible
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:05:42 rip lol
general 2022-01-15 17:07:45 wait if i use a camera fold am i just gonna have to deal with the random motor connected to my build or is there a way i can make it invisible
also my build tends to come apart so if anyone knows how to fix this tell me please
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:11:41 thats really good
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:12:06 can you help me with a question because noone else seeeems to want to answer it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:12:11 if i use a camera fold am i just gonna have to deal with the random motor connected to my build or is there a way i can make it invisible
also my build tends to come apart so if anyone knows how to fix this tell me please
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:13:31 and what i mean by that is the build is splitting in half because the camera fold cant keep it in place apparently
general 2022-01-15 17:13:54 ok.
general 2022-01-15 17:36:28 my camera fold wont hold my plane together in flight
general 2022-01-15 17:57:39 lol
bot-central 2022-01-15 17:57:43 !rank
general 2022-01-15 18:25:39 alright how do i fix motors being annoying in camera fold
general 2022-01-15 18:25:57 it makes my build look weird because theres a random motor flying next to me
bot-central 2022-01-15 19:44:14 !rank
general 2022-01-15 19:44:47 lmao what conversation did i just walk in on
general 2022-01-15 19:45:03 uhm
general 2022-01-15 19:45:46 ah yes ive been there before im quite familiar with the location actually
general 2022-01-15 19:46:41 especially them
general 2022-01-15 19:49:54 dang nice
general 2022-01-15 19:50:46 the best thing to happen in my town is they have to rebuild and renovate the old theatre thatr i kid you not hasnt done anything since the 1950s and they are trying to turn it back into a movie theatre after a wall collapsed
general 2022-01-15 19:51:04 gotta love ohio construction
general 2022-01-15 19:51:22 because THEY NEVER FINISH IT
general 2022-01-15 19:51:40 that looks like amazing bread
bot-central 2022-01-15 19:51:46 !rank
general 2022-01-15 19:54:40 oh i got to pick my highschool
general 2022-01-15 19:55:06 im doing engineering at a early college high school now
general 2022-01-15 19:55:22 lmao
general 2022-01-15 19:55:53 im sorry but i agree with the anime pfp for once, you are unfunny
general 2022-01-15 19:56:22 a person
general 2022-01-15 19:56:44 thanks for pointing out im low rank to me
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:57:06 nice
general 2022-01-15 19:57:34 yeah i am building as we speak lmao
bot-central 2022-01-15 19:57:47 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:57:56 oof
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:58:02 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:58:23 building something i sketched in a notebook when i was bored in class
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:58:36 i named it the BK02-1
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:58:44 yep
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:59:02 its supposed to compete with the an124 (fictional aircraft things)
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 19:59:13 this is my first aircraft without using a tutorial so
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:00:18 pretty much what i have been trying to do for the last 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:00:29 the length?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:00:40 ohhh
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:00:51 expand it backwards
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:01:34 quite literally impossible unless i tear half the build i spent 8 hours on apart
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:02:03 one sec
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:02:25 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:02:30 in the middle of building a engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:03:07 alright then
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:03:14 so thickness is what you want
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:03:26 alright just had to say that
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:03:52 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:04:38 i also have a issue with my camera fold
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:04:58 it looks akward to be flying with a motor floating in mid air
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:05:31 imma delete the engine rq so i can move it forward later
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:06:32 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:13:23 im american but i know a little spanish
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:13:49 you have to get level 3
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:13:54 on mee6
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:13:58 so speak for a while
bot-central 2022-01-15 20:14:24 !rank <@!930842770992668773>
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:21:54 i juist realized i have to extend the wings somehow with 0 room to extend them
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:27:48 <@!702907851001167882>
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:28:00 im gonna lengthen the wings
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:31:25 i could also make it 3d but this is my first plane without a tut so
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:31:44 thats what im doing lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:32:07 folding downwards now
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:32:18 i can add a small winglet maybe
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:32:23 idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:32:45 also the only motorlocking i have ever done was attempting to make a flying wing
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:34:13 also adding to it the only reference i have is a drawing i did during class when i got all my work done
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:44:10 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:44:18 im thinking bout making the tail thicker
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:53:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:53:14 time to figure out the very large issue of the fact that i dont have any landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:53:30 i used almost every square inch of my buildspace
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:53:33 gotta love it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:54:09 its a hyperbole i think i have space
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:54:58 its my first build without a tut and im new to motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:55:41 also i have space to the side just not up but i made sure to compensate for that
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:55:59 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:56:06 this is what im workign with to try and motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:56:19 shouldent have said that its not true lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:56:41 i have like 3 blocks height max to build gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:56:55 getting to that soon
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:57:24 gotta love dual rudders tbh
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:57:46 folded this thing more than my morning omlettes
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:00:22 maybe i could start by adding leading edges with half wedge downs
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:00:43 im listening
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:00:48 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:01:02 if you want to join my game then that would prob be perfect
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:01:16 my roblox user is my user in trhis server so
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:02:28 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:03:07 maybe i can have the plane start with the gear up to give me more space
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:10:42 ok thank you
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:11:17 i friended you so if you accept that you can just join my game or smthn
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:11:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:12:06 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:59:47 ?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:09:12 dang
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:16:36 oh wait i forgot to ask you bout this
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:16:41 <@!740790456182636595>
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:16:57 the camera fold wont hold the plane together in flight i have to adjuist it sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:17:02 is there a way to fix that
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:18:01 also im nearing 2k blocks on this thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:18:29 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:18:30 this thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:18:42 lemme unfold it rq
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:18:58 5 seconds exactly
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:19:28 god connection
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:19:35 my computer is sheit
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:20:24 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:20:30 i only have the nose gear done so far though
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:20:54 designed by myself in a notebook while bored at school
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:21:02 thats what im doing in a sec
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:21:15 i have some higher priorities than the engines at the moment
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:21:21 mk
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:22:14 im literally just going to make a engine shape and motorlock stuff into it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:22:57 so
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:23:15 im making it partially working
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:23:24 its gonna kinda be half and half
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:23:29 its hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:23:50 large
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:24:27 I FINALLY FIXED IT FROM BEING TAIL HEAVY
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:28:39 nope
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:30:39 figuring out landing gear doors
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:39:02 no because thats self promoting i believe
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:39:39 yeah idk im just here
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:40:27 i forgot to turn on servo and toggle thats why the doors wouldent move bruv
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:41:48 i need to figure out landing gear doors asdfkasjdlfjasldfjas
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:42:17 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:42:42 especially because the nose gear is special
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:43:35 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:43:42 ah yes tri wheel gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:44:11 i might end up using wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:44:35 but before doors i think i should really figure out the main gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:46:07 the main gear is gonna have 8 gear (4 each side) but should i put it right above where my characters head is or farther back
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:47:42 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:47:57 should i put the main gear partially under the wing partially behind or fully behind
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:48:47 this build has almost 2k parts lmao
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:49:27 :| this gonna get laggy soon
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:49:57 lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 22:50:13 i should prob finish motorlocking the wings before i worry about gear
creations-chat 2022-01-15 22:52:03 can i post unfinished thing here?
alright cool
creations-chat 2022-01-15 22:54:56 unfinished thing, still motorlocking the wing, making main gear rn and keep in mind this is my first non tutorial build so im not very experienced in creating custom stuff

i call it the buckeye BK02-1 and its reference is something i drew in my notebook while bored
creations-chat 2022-01-15 23:02:03 .
creations-chat 2022-01-15 23:11:18 can i get feedback on my first plane without a tutorial
im making the thicker wing its halfway done in the picture <@!882419947819638825>
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:26:00 i need help making a way to make my massive plane steer on the ground
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:26:24 
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:26:28 heres the nose gear we are working with
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:28:39 should i add rope or something
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:29:34 idk how to get this thing to turn
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:30:00 or maybe i do one sec
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:31:53 i did it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:36:31 nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:39:34 how should i do the piston
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:39:41 what settings
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:42:04 toggle?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:42:19 yeah but will i have to extend them
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:42:41 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:43:20 uhm
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:43:29 do i have to move my gear up now in the editor
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:44:05 im in a private server ill send you the link
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:45:53 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 00:54:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 00:54:49 i figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 01:46:23 so i finished the plane other than adding under wing engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 01:46:31 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 01:46:37 found out it doubles as a boat
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:38:40 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:38:42 it is finished
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:38:48 other than engines because im lazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:41:02 ikr
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:41:18 its my first plane wqithout a tut so eh its good enough for me
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:41:49 nope
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:42:02 wdym by that
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:42:28 it took 12.5 hours to build lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:42:41 pretty much
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:43:41 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:43:53 an124 on crack
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:43:59 essentially
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:44:04 its my own design
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:44:11 but its not a totally original design
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 02:56:37 ty
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:14:41 "into the drink" starring sunstorms BK02-1
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:15:09 would be a good series name for a plane crash tbh
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:15:19 what?
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:27:50 engines are overrated
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:28:12 pretty much the entire design of the plane (which was by me)
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:28:16 no
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:29:09 i mean its my first plane i built without a tutorial and i just spent 12 hours on it and i dont feel like doing anything else other than fly it now
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:29:46 humans are overrated
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:30:15 didnt say they shouldent exist
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:30:24 most likely
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 03:30:34 also knocked off like 50 iq
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 15:14:07 what should i do as my next build
an225
an124
erj145
e175
737-200
or embraer phenom 300
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 15:15:40 alright then since your the only one to have suggested something an225 it is
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 15:52:46 hey nightchaser
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 15:52:51 i finished the plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 16:36:46 2/4 engines done on this thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 16:45:12 hm
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 16:45:17 show me a picture of it
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 16:45:38 screenshot it
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 16:45:48 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:39:33 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:39:39 3/4 engines done
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:40:27 Yes lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:40:56 After this think I’m thinking about either doing a Erj 145 or a embraer phenom 300
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:49:44 My own design
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:49:55 Loosely based off the an225
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:50:02 And c-5
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:50:12 It’s called the BK02-1
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:51:29 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 17:52:19 I have a sketch as my reference but this is designed to be larger, but I scaled it down since this plane is my first plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:21:51 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:21:58 It’s 2600 now but
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:22:38 The new gta 6 lel
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 18:59:13 Lmfao
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:00:47 What are you trying to get him to do
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:00:52 MOTOR 2
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:01:02 SERVO TOGGLE 15 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:01:10 I believe
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:01:38 If you set it to servo+toggle you can have keybinds instead of mouse
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:02:06 How long have you gone played this game dude
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:02:26 I want to try and help him but ok ig
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:02:47 Bro I have been playing for 2 months and I understand more
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:03:08 Maybe
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:03:54 That one that I’m adding engines to isn’t a tut it’s my own design but it’s the first plane I have really tried on that’s not a small prop
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:04:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:04:01 This one
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:04:43 Someone asked me if it was a 13 black plus tutorial as soon as I started making it pretty much
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:04:55 Also I’m trying to get the nose to open like the an225
plane-crazy 2022-01-16 19:05:10 I think I know a way to motorlock it though
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:39:19 
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:39:23 It is done
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:40:10 First plane without a tutorial I bring you the BK02-1
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:41:04 Thanks
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:41:38 I need to angle lock the rest of the half blocks onto the wings but I’m too lazy to
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:41:46 Ty
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:42:18 Also I decided that engines weren’t overrated and added them to the wings
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:43:05 ?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:43:47 Bruuuuhhhhh and a screenshot doesn’t tell me anything tell me the issue use your words
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:44:34 There are pylons they may be slightly small but I really don’t see an issue with the engine size
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:46:28 Best I can do is one block forward but I just want to be done with the project I’m not rebuilding the engines
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:46:43 What can I use then
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:48:14 Imma just keep what I have
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:48:26 The alternative was a water wheel which I don’t have so
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:48:52 The water wheel would have probably looked so much better
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:49:48 Summer
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:50:34 Summer event is water wheel
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:50:40 There’s winter wheel
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:50:47 Which is winter event
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:58:03 I think I’m gonna scale it down for my next one
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:58:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 00:58:13 E175 or e145
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 01:07:18 Ik I haven’t seen anyone build a train for a long time

plane-crazy 2022-01-18 14:55:09 imma build a blended wing airliner since im dying of covid for the next 2 weeks
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 21:35:49 
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 21:36:10 My first attempt at a large amount motor locked plane I’m making a mig29
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:06:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:06:43 Because idk
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:06:57 It’s my first built with a lot of motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:08:34 Bro it’s volunteering it isn’t supposed to be a real job why are you hating on someone who has probably been more successful than you 💀
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:10:45 Bruuhhhhh
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:10:59 He told him to save <:BIG1:588443768806703124> <:BIG2:588443778554134540>

plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:12:59 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:13:20 I’m trying to make a motorlocked plane and if I lost some of that it would be a pain in the arse
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:14:29 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:14:50 Repost but I think imma delete the wedge 1x4 to make it thiccer
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:15:21 It will also hide the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:16:33 I didn’t delete anything
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:16:43 I’m not home rn so I can’t access plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:16:51 I said I’m gonna change that
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:17:02 
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:17:06 See the back motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:17:22 It brings the trail to the nose and in the center
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:17:29 And some other stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:17:39 Yes lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:18:52 Cool
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 22:18:59 I’m not home so it’s gonna be a bit
creations-chat 2022-02-26 23:53:55 He said you are which is the same thing
bot-central 2022-02-27 01:46:07 -servers
bot-central 2022-02-27 01:46:34 yeah im only active if i want feedback on a build
bot-central 2022-02-27 01:47:13 i dont but i have a huge cargo thing
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:38:53 lol im in the middle of making  one
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:39:15 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:39:24 i need to fix the intake
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:39:44 LOL
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:39:46 we should
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:39:53 mig29 battle royale
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:45:15 mine has chunky and rounded intakes i need to fix that in the morning
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:46:02 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:46:39 huh
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:50:54 this is what my lock looks like lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:51:24 this was before intake was partially finished but i think they are too rounded
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:52:39 this is my first motor lock thats more than 1 tower for the afterburner connecting a jet engine and a rocket
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:52:58 i think im doing pretty good with that fact
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:55:26 <@!728791497624911974>
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:55:53 dont mind the mini a10 motor lock my friend made in the background
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:58:02 nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 04:58:20 im figuring out how to lock the horizontal stabilizers rn before i go to bed in a sec
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:11:29 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:11:34 i feel like this tail shape is just
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:11:36 wrong
creations-chat 2022-02-27 05:13:47 i dont think this tail shape is doing so good (this is a mig29 for reference)
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:17:04 mig 29
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:17:21 the rest of it before i added tail
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 05:17:32 but im currently laying in bed and dont wanna get up
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:56:05 im using icy trapdoors and delta wings instead of wing panels on my mig29 because i dont know better and someone told me to do that
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:58:34 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:58:42 ignore the tail and the fact i have no elevators yet
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:58:59 im fixing the tail
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:59:30 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 14:59:38 this is my first build using more than one motorlock lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:00:06 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:14:35 finally got all the trapdoors on the wings
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:14:55 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:40:57 its not gonna be for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:41:18 its more just a proof of concept and my first attempt at using a large amount of motorlocks
general 2022-02-27 15:41:32 rip the an225

plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:23:24 i settled for default gear
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:23:35 
plane-crazy 2022-02-27 23:33:41 heres the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 00:35:36 well uh
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 00:35:40 theres 1 part exposed

plane-crazy 2022-02-28 00:38:01 now im a pile of rubble
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 01:06:29 its my first motorlocked build :(
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:11:49 oh nice
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:09:09 My slightly unfinished mig29 (first attempt at using motorlocks)
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:11:10 If I can find the one I sent to someone else as it’s in my computer and I’m not home yet
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:16:36 It has some exposed motorlock on the top but I don’t think it’s too bad to have to cover up
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:48:46 Mk thanks I’ll try and fix it once I get home
creations-chat 2022-02-28 19:51:00 And the elevens are unfinished and just there for flight testing rn because I wanted to see if it could fly well first
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:14:09 Bro went back to February 2021 to tell someone they should build something
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:15:09 I don’t really think thats too overlocked especially compared to other builds
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 15:21:18 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:34:58 building a large cargo plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:41:59 oh god ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 21:42:07 i might actually try lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 01:55:34 it is staring back at me
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:01:33 i cant unsee it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:08:09 ah yes a build im gonna have to fold every which way
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:08:38 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:08:48 the aircraft is to compete with the an225 if it still was a thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:08:58 but i designed this like a month ago
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:12:23 ikr
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:13:07 then 90 garbage builds
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:14:07 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:14:25 i dont even post my creations in the creations channel i just get feedback and then keep them to myself
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:16:10 i cant even discern a difference other than different camera angles
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:16:37 ah ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:20:43 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:20:46 this is getting bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:24:05 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:24:19 orange juice extractor lookin thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:26:17 oh god what in the holy land
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:28:40 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:28:47 second section of fuselage done
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:29:45 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:30:01 i suck at motorlocking i shouldent try and help i dont know why i am saying anything
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:31:48 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:31:51 i dont think i can fit this anymore
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:31:58 time to do the only thing i can do now
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:32:01 GO UP
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:32:07 ik
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:32:15 i was gonna make the tail open upwards anyways
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:33:00 how do i fold it to the top
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:33:07 i havent really done that before lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:33:21 hm ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 02:58:46 oh no
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:05:08 ehhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:05:13 debatable
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:05:19 did i make the plane wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:05:21 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:05:46 but i designed it that way so its not wasting space if it fits with how i designed it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:06:36 most likely
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:06:52 because its a 5 wide space theres not much else i can do wtih it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:07:13 oh dang
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:07:35 uhm
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:07:39 this is my 3rd custom build
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:07:47 im not that experienced
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:07:55 jesus
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:08:25 also i may or may not be struggling with how to make ***thick*** wings
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:08:35 and they-
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:08:38 nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:10:02 no because my builds arent good lmao and people generally dont want to build the custom things i make sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:10:34 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:10:38 like look at this chonky thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:10:42 taken in 144p
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:11:09 i genuinely cant tell if thats a c5 or custom
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:12:09 <@!877391100137070625> i may or may not have folded the fuselage up already
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:12:38 of what
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:12:50 how-
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:12:53 motorlocking?
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:13:27 i cant motorlock for shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:13:58 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:14:04 this is the only motorlocking build i have made
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:14:14 ignore me saying O i was responding to someone else
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:14:53 mmmmk....
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:17:53 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:17:59 i can def fit another part on that side
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:18:09 just got to figure out how the hell to fold it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:18:41 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:19:50 how do i fold it is my question
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:19:57 one sec
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:19:59 i have an idea
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:22:43 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:22:46 one space gap
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:22:52 time to attempt and make a fold in there
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:27:58 yep
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:28:11 wait can you show me what that would look like
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:40:02 i may or may not have just power cycled my pc by accidentally kicking my power strip and losing some save progress
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:44:01 autosave just saved me
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 03:46:22 imma head to bed dm me the motor picture thing and ill look at it in the morning

plane-crazy 2022-03-02 20:39:22 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 20:47:27 i figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:01:41 
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:01:42 hm yes tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:10 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:12 take a guess
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:28 it is certified you wont guess it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:33 100% confident
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:44 shit you got it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:41:52 but what plane <:rockdubious:900845908177088512>
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:15 wrong
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:18 try again
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:20 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:21 actually
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:26 i might make it commercial
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:28 not cargo
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:45 commercial now
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:42:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:43:02 it took me 1 hour to build the fuselage and design it
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:43:24 well
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 21:43:30 im figuring out the rest of the tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 01:04:13 stuff
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 01:04:13 
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 02:13:54 
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 02:13:56 tail is done now
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 02:14:02 time to attempt thicc wings
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:13:46 I’m thinking about building another fighter jet thing utilizing motorlock since I don’t use it often so any ideas to what fighter jet I should build
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:17:46 Mk
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:18:06 Ooooo
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:18:18 Ok yeah imma do that after I finish this cargo plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:18:39 Or actually imma do that when I get home to take a break from cargo plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:18:53 Should I try and angle lock the wings because I have never used angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:26:19 This will be Interesting
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:32:28 Didn’t realize they were different whoops
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:32:33 I posted the wrong thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:32:58 
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 18:33:10 This is the only one imma do
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 19:47:54 3:1 scale moment
creations-chat 2022-03-03 20:03:05 The easiest way would be to fold the tails and wings up and motorlock the center wing down possibly
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:45:08 
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:45:13 how can i make rounded intakes like this
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:45:40 motorlocked half cylinders might be my best bet
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:50:21 shoot wait i forgot about round wedge outs
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:50:24 i think i got it
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:55:51 im actually not gonna do the su47
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 20:55:59 imma do a ground attack aircraft rq
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:10:04 
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:10:05 so
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:10:12 i need to make wings thicker and longer
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:10:26 but it doesnt seem i can make them super thick and make them longer
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:13:43 nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:14:25 its me that wont lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:14:29 ^
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:14:40 this thing is nearly 3 plots long when unfolded
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:05 <@!652190076222046249>
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:14 im running out of space and have a descision
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:26 should i only make it 1 block thick and make it longer
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:36 or should i make it not longer and thicker
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:41 because its kinda short rn
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:48 so im leaning towards 1st option
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:15:54 the wing i mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:17:03 because i have horrible space management
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:17:16 
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:17:33 because
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:17:56 because i designed it after myself and its only my 3rd plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:18:49 because im good that way and i designed it myself
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:19:01 also i prefer larger planes and its better to learn now than struggle later
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:19:21 also because its a top view
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:19:26 nothing looks good from a top view
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:21:35 mmmmkkk
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:21:41 lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:26:36 i think i got it
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:27:07 disconnectors + explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:27:31 explosives blocks = arm on key + explode on impact and turn the impact speed down a little
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:00:27 I’m getting bored of plane crazy because i can’t find something to build so give me an airliner or something to build
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:01:12 Dang
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:01:15 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:01:52 ^
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:02:45 Uhhh do you know what company made it
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:03:30 
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:03:46 Oh ok

plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:06:16 <@!404632014189494293>
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:06:20 Ohhhh
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:06:41 What in lords name
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:07:37 I don’t think I want to build that lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:07:48 Screw it im building a embraer phenom 300
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:10:22 They thought up that shit in the 1930s?!?
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:10:42 I want some of what they were smoking because that was probably some strong stuff
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:11:01 Still
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:11:15 That looks like a concept from 2040
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 16:13:01 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 14:23:23 I got bored so I tried to make working instruments for an airliner

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 01:15:07 compact
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 01:16:31 i added armants so this is a bit outdated
creations-chat 2022-03-23 18:55:05 Drone thing that I’m in the middle of finishing, and yes I need to add detail to the engine that’s the part that’s in the middle of a revamp but it’s not supposed to be a rq4 while it’s based off it it’s mostly a custom design
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:11:47 It’s based of the rq4 if that answers the intake question, also that’s what I mean by engine I’m reworking that rn
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:13:52 The exposed motors are mainly for angling the stabilizers and elevators and ailerons, I’m not good at hiding stuff as this is my 4th plane and 2nd motorlocked build
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:15:54 Did you even read the end of the description of the plane ITS MOSTLY A CUSTOM DESIGN JUST PARTIALLY BASED OFF THE RQ4 SO ITS NOT GONNA LOOK LIKE IT Thanks for the feedback though I’ll try and fix up a few things
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:18:06 Are you talking about my build? It’s a plane….. that’s what I thought, edited it
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:21:02 I’m not trying to excuse it I’m fixing the stuff he mentioned rn but I have a lack of skill as this is my 4th build and my 2nd motorlocked build
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:31:24 how about instead of being a dumbass and just flaming my build you give me constructive criticism and feedback so i can FIX THE ISSUES WITH THE BUILD
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:36:12 ?
creations-chat 2022-03-23 19:41:05 ok then
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:34:54 no exposed motorlock so far
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:35:36 
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:35:41 my first angle locking project btw
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:36:30 mine?
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:36:36 its a custom thing im trying to make
plane-crazy 2022-04-01 16:37:07 i designed it randomely just for my first anglelocking project
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 21:56:49 Business class cabin for my delta 757
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:49:27 im trying to make a e170, any thoughts to make this look less like a 737 and more like a e170
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:52:43 maybe the smaller scale looks more like a e170
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:54:38 idk e170 nose is making me be in pain
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:57:37 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:00:39 why does this look a bit like an a220
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:01:19 this was the original nose i had earlier i might make changes to this and make some stuff farther out
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:03:29 
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:03:37 looks kinda good ngl

plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:39:32 
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:39:44 i may go back to the 1x2 window because it looks kinda like a a320 rn

plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:41:50 kk
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:47:16 i might change the entire nose shape to have a better cockpit because i like having realistic interiors
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:48:58 no like the cockpit window shape is like horrid
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 17:51:59 i think i found a way to rework it
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 18:07:26 i think i found a decent new shape
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 18:56:09 WHAT WAS MEANT BY SAYING THE PHRASE " NO ITS ROBLOX" IN RESPONSE TO EARLY ALPHA TESTING QUESTIONS
