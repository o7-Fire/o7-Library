general 2020-08-27 16:32:15 sovereign was just a brick
general 2020-08-27 16:32:29 rorq has needed a remodel
general 2020-08-27 16:32:31 since like
general 2020-08-27 16:32:39 2017
general 2020-08-27 16:32:56 galaxy isnt OG chad game anymore
general 2020-08-27 16:32:58 it is
general 2020-08-27 16:33:00 spiky ship game
general 2020-08-27 16:33:01 now
general 2020-08-27 16:33:07 i prefer the old style
general 2020-08-27 16:33:11 sovereign was just a brick
general 2020-08-27 16:33:14 and hawklight was
general 2020-08-27 16:33:16 w e d g e
general 2020-08-27 16:33:42 starscape just looks graphically better
general 2020-08-27 16:33:48 its more pleasing
general 2020-08-27 16:33:53 galaxy has better models
general 2020-08-27 16:33:59 but inconsistent style and stuff
general 2020-08-27 16:34:13 battle the old models in galaxy are nicer tbh
general 2020-08-27 16:34:17 its just
general 2020-08-27 16:34:19 nostalgia
general 2020-08-27 16:34:25 i like the blocky style
general 2020-08-27 16:34:36 vip galaxy is literally all small ships.
general 2020-08-27 16:34:48 frigates are
general 2020-08-27 16:34:50 absurdly small
general 2020-08-27 16:34:52 in galaxy
general 2020-08-27 16:34:54 destroyers
general 2020-08-27 16:35:07 frigate is viper
general 2020-08-27 16:35:23 dreadnoughts are absurdly small tbh
general 2020-08-27 16:35:27 it makes sense but
general 2020-08-27 16:35:32 the scale of ships in that game
general 2020-08-27 16:35:33 is ehhhhh
general 2020-08-27 16:35:51 honestly all the combat classes are real small
general 2020-08-27 16:36:09 frigates and destroyers in galaxy
general 2020-08-27 16:36:17 are just fighters and heavy fighters respectively
general 2020-08-27 16:36:26 cruisers are frigate sized
general 2020-08-27 16:36:32 bc's are destroyer sized
general 2020-08-27 16:36:34 so on
general 2020-08-27 16:36:43 they smol
general 2020-08-27 16:36:47 the scaling in that game is
general 2020-08-27 16:36:49 really strange
general 2020-08-27 16:36:54 not that starscape is much better
general 2020-08-27 16:36:57 but you get the point
general 2020-08-27 16:37:09 frigates in sc do have some bulk, i'll give them that
general 2020-08-27 16:37:23 black hole 😳

general 2020-08-27 16:39:53 old sovereign was like
general 2020-08-27 16:39:56 a rounded brick

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:00:34 i facetanked like 5 88s with the arl 44 because the tiger was stupid and kept shooting my hull
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:00:52 hetzers are little fucking demons

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:03:52 yknow whats funny is that the french sherman with the sa50 can pen the tiger's ufp and its 4.7
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:05:23 the arl 44 has an ammorack literally everywhere people shoot you but half the time they wont even pen
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:06:24 its actually really good iirc its ufp is like 160mm but its turret is like 100-120mm on the front
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:06:40 160mm sloped at 45 degrees*

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:10:12 healthbars are cringe
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:10:31 both games are shitty but wt is less shitty
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:10:58 wt has arcade mode though which basically mixes wt rb and wot
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:12:16 i prefer wt just because it makes more sense, cause in wot tanks outside your visual range are just invisible while in wt you actually have to be hard to spot so
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:12:33 uh oh naughty word!!!
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:13:18 fair yeah, i just prefer wt due to more realism in terms of damage and its gameplay can actually revolve around real life tactics sometimes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:13:58 ~~imagine needing 3 different games for all the different classes of vehicles amirite~~
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:14:22 lmao naval is just forgotten

creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:18:43 fair
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:19:12 honestly the only reason i prefer wt is just its realism, i never really liked healthbars on tanks
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:20:13 i just thought of something cursed
creations-chat 2020-09-24 17:20:29 wt damage model on infantry

general 2020-09-28 16:49:33 it probably climbs at 3276853 m/s too
general 2020-09-28 16:49:42 instead of being fair and balanced
general 2020-09-28 16:49:48 germany needs heavy nerfs
general 2020-09-28 16:50:00 ~~make wt more realistic with reliability problems~~
general 2020-09-28 16:50:27 
general 2020-09-28 16:50:34 this is how you know the balance team is monkeys
general 2020-09-28 16:50:46 it cant even pen itself
general 2020-09-28 16:50:48 with APCR
general 2020-09-28 16:51:31 if soviet and germany get balanced then french armor would actually FUCKING FUNCTION
general 2020-09-28 16:51:53 also can we just
general 2020-09-28 16:51:55 remove sweden
general 2020-09-28 16:52:00 entirely
general 2020-09-28 16:52:06 and move the r3 to 7.7-8.7
general 2020-09-28 16:53:17 the b1 is the only decent domestic french tank at low tier besides the ter which is premium and the arl 44 which is POSTWAR
general 2020-09-28 16:53:32 france sucks so much ass in this game
general 2020-09-28 16:53:35 we need
general 2020-09-28 16:53:41 a fucking TANK FROM THE EARLY 50s
general 2020-09-28 16:53:44 AT 3.7
general 2020-09-28 16:54:47 yes i do
general 2020-09-28 16:54:55 because i grinded through FUCKING FRENCH 1.0
general 2020-09-28 16:55:30 all 1.0 sucks
general 2020-09-28 16:55:37 and yet
general 2020-09-28 16:55:38 the bts
general 2020-09-28 16:55:40 and the stuarts
general 2020-09-28 16:55:42 exist
general 2020-09-28 16:55:54 they can actually do their fucking job
general 2020-09-28 16:56:08 the role french 1.0s had doesnt even FUCKING EXIST in wt
general 2020-09-28 16:57:11 and that mantlet
general 2020-09-28 16:57:36 it really does
general 2020-09-28 16:57:44 pretty sure that mantlet will absorb anything
general 2020-09-28 16:57:55 plus the mg crew is meat armor
general 2020-09-28 16:57:58 ^
general 2020-09-28 16:58:03 french tanks suck ass in wt
general 2020-09-28 16:58:38 you cant drive a tank to a capture point to replenish the crew in french 1.0s
general 2020-09-28 16:58:53 because they only have 2 fucking crew members
general 2020-09-28 16:59:13 and some monkey thought it was smart to you know, kill you instantly when your driver survives
general 2020-09-28 17:00:38 rus and germany are overpowered
general 2020-09-28 17:00:54 i dont want to know how that went
general 2020-09-28 17:01:25 i hate a lot of ger players
general 2020-09-28 17:01:40 whenever they oneshot stuff that could facetank their shells they claim they're not op
general 2020-09-28 17:01:55 and when their precious kruppstahl gets penned they cry on the forums
general 2020-09-28 17:02:04 at least france has a fucking reason to complain
general 2020-09-28 17:03:07 the panzer 4 f2 isnt what im complaining about
general 2020-09-28 17:03:12 its the heat on the f1
general 2020-09-28 17:03:47 the panzer 4 f2 is at a br where its armor doesnt really matter anymore
general 2020-09-28 17:05:10 the sherman 76 variants, t34/85, and panzer 4 f2 were probably the best tanks of ww2
general 2020-09-28 17:06:10 in wt german tanks arent limited with what problems they had
general 2020-09-28 17:06:44 the tiger and panther sucked ass when you compare them to the backbone tanks
general 2020-09-28 17:07:35 also germany's backbone was mostly just the shorter gun variants of panzer 3 and 4

general 2020-09-28 17:09:11 but that was later war
general 2020-09-28 17:09:23 most of the war was fought with the shorter gun panzers
general 2020-09-28 17:09:50 and the beginning was the worst panzers
general 2020-09-28 17:10:02 1-2 was like 1939-1940

the-dump 2020-09-30 15:46:41 As we can see, King Bach struggles to eat what seem to be noodles efficiently with chopsticks. This prompts the seemingly stereotypical Asian man sitting in front of Bach to humorously state "Black guy having trouble." while neatly maneuvering his chopsticks to demonstrate his prowess. We can assume the Asian individual says this statement as he may have the notion that people of dark skin color can not use chopsticks well while he who is of Asian descent can. Bach then suddenly shifts his body language and retorts. "Ain't no trouble," while calling for his friend Rico. Rico then enters the scene with a comically large fork which he passes to Bach. This is funny as you would not expect anyone to casually possess such a massive fork while in a restaurant as it is extremely unorthodox. Bach then proceeds to take the large fork and vigorously stab his takeout box while uttering the in complete phrase. "Yeah, what's up motherf-." Due to the Bach's unexpected possession of such a large fork, the Asian man shouts. "Damn." with a look of shock on his face. This sequence of events is quite hilarious as it was not expected for Bach to violently stab his takeout box with such a comically large fork and for the Asian man to react so vocally. This is why the video so humorous and was on the 2012 Epic Vine compilation playlist.
