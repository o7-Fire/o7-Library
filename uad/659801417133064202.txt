creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:40:11 I thought of making a zumwalt class destroyer, what do you think about it so far?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:40:52 i only started it like 20 minutes ago so all i got is the front
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:47:54 eh

creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:49:56 <@!726156798603821107> try building a boat. probably the easiest things to make
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:50:14 Hmmmm
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:51:12 Zumwalt class shouldnt be too hard
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:51:39 The front of it is basically an upside down bow of a normal ship
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:52:07 hmm
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:54:47 <@!726156798603821107> try the Arleigh Burke
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:55:09 looks pretty simple
creations-chat 2020-10-06 15:56:19 *its been so long since ive made a boat i forgot how to fold*
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:35:38 just finished the hull of my zumwalt class
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:36:29 next im gonna make the bridge
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:36:53 then the back landing pad, then the turrets will be last
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:37:39 what are you doin step sis
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:39:42 ok change of plans on my zumwalt, im gonna do front guns first, then bridge, then landing pad
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:40:01 because i looked up a picture and
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:40:34 just feel like it would be easier

creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:47:04 i used 1x2
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:47:22 so 1x3 or 1x4
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:48:41 i think that would make it shorter....
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:50:04 anyone here have any experience with ships
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:51:16 because i want a second opinion, this is my build. wait for slowmode so i can post a real photo for comparison
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:51:32 and this is the real thing
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:51:50 is the bow too short?
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:54:42 darker?
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:55:36 is that good
creations-chat 2020-10-09 01:55:53 do i go darker, do i go lighter

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:42:27 i wanted to build a halo warthog
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:42:40 so what do you think is the block to feet ratio
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:42:42 or meters
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:42:49 like is a block one meter
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:43:41 ok but still
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:43:46 how big is one block
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:43:50 like a meter?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 05:45:30 alright ill just guess
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:26:12 i thought of making a zumwalt
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:26:36 But i have no clue how to get the bow right and the gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:26:47 Because the bow is like
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:26:55 very thin
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:27:07 so it has to to be even on each side
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:27:16 meaning the gun will be off point
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 04:27:42 but if i put an extra wedge in the middle itll be off point
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 03:32:41 Thought about making a huey

If you sit in a seat, whether you have a build spawned or not and whether its yours or someone elses seat, it wont let you sit in any seats at all unless you reset.
**How to recreate:**
Step 1. Sit in any seat at all
Step 2. Jump out of the seat
Step 3. Try and sit back down
