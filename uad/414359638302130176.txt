general 2020-09-01 23:03:52 pog
general 2020-09-01 23:05:32 Just started playing yesterday, i’m inheriting an afterburner/hyperdrive into my fighter jet. I want it to reach Mach 1. Is the in-game speedometer SPS, KPH or MPH?
general 2020-09-01 23:05:43 Ahh ok thanks
general 2020-09-01 23:07:30 oml
general 2020-09-01 23:07:59 If i wanted my fighter to reach mach 1 it would need to go roughly 15,340SPS
general 2020-09-01 23:08:26 uncontrollable, though.
general 2020-09-01 23:08:36 lol
general 2020-09-01 23:09:51 I have an AA turret, an A-10 that is smol, an American fighter jet of some sort which i will place a conveyer drive into and a triple-propeller German plane.
general 2020-09-01 23:10:08 same
general 2020-09-01 23:10:24 i only use tutorials for conveyer drives

creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:08:41 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:11:52 Ok, teslas use smart air suspension so, although it will take up quite a bit of space, piston with a sideways 1x3with two motor 1s unpowered on reset holding a powered motor 1
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:12:20 LOL
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:12:55 Yes but

creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:15:42 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:16:34 ill make it so the suspension travel is limited
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:17:20 and i will connect a spring to the chassis off the powered motor 1 to make it more rigid
creations-chat 2020-09-26 06:17:36 Teslas dont have drive shafts

creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:04:36 What do you guys think of my Concorde, I spent 4 hours getting it to fly perfectly and have a working Droop Snoot.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:06:01 It took me 3 days to build the plane itself, I went through 4 versions before I got the current wings and fuselage.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:07:05 i spent an hour shortening it to be able to make the nose longer...
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:08:41 It's the best I could do to get every motor into the nose and stll have everything function
creations-chat 2020-10-30 23:10:09 In that nose, there is 2 motors, a piston and that is motorlocked by two locked motors which go into the nose so I didn't really have any space for anything, I went through 13 versions of windshield for the droopsnoot.

creations-chat 2020-11-11 09:42:23 <@!407347404858458123> the reason there is a hammer and sickle is because the Russians captured the prototype hull and the 2nd prototype turret, put them together and took the finished Pz VIII back to Russia. It had the USSR hammer and sickle because it was captured by the Russians. It now sits in the Kubinka Tank Museum near Moscow.

creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:48:16 I got blacklisted because of some dumbass spammer. The type that ignores complaints in creations chat. I posted an image that said 'shut up dumbass' and got blacklisted. Also, Retre, your only rank is aeronaut III and Symbion is a sad little verified.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:51:25 First off, I can't be bothered to read your name. I'm fucking tired and depressed. Plus, it's a joke that has literally been around in PCC for a while. Unranked means you either can't be bothered to attempt to build something good or just can't be bothered to build at all.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 16:53:03 Applying for a rank literally takes 30 seconds.

general 2020-11-30 17:47:23 there
general 2020-11-30 17:47:59 sometimes I wonder why I even bother doing anything. Life is, after all, and endless struggle to achieve a sense or state of perfection that can never truly be attained because the human conscience functions in a way where it is never happy with what it has and always wants more and that leads you down a dark path, spiralling into chaos, and eternal greed consumes your soul. Happiness and satisfaction are temporary illusions for the weak-minded and the foolish, because meaningful action cannot be brought by most people due unto how society is constructed and how power is unfairly distributed. Everything seems meaningful, yet everything seems meaningless.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:48:53 Memes have to be funny.
general 2020-11-30 17:49:46 I have a recommendation that will ideally make it so that each time you close your eyes, you don't need to sob about how awful of a person you are; it includes you quieting the fuck down and giving the new staff part some an ideal opportunity to figure out how staffing functions instead of being a prick towards them. Your remark, and in all honesty his quiet reaction, are decisively the explanation somebody like him got staff over you. On the off chance that I find you being discourteous towards any of my staff like that I will ensure you get restricted, mark my screwing words. I have had enough of your bologna since you did likewise correct thing to me when I got enrolled as junior mod, and no one ought to need to manage somebody like you when they're in that position. Realize your damn place.

creations-chat 2021-02-15 18:12:35 Anything I should change? (HSTV-L)
creations-chat 2021-02-15 18:19:11 I know, I'm waiting for Torb to come online. It's a collab build. He built the turret, I built the hull.

I copy his turret, he copies my hull. there's gonna be two HSTV-Ls.

sorry thought you were replying to me
creations-chat 2021-02-16 10:25:51 i just build tanks and planes
creations-chat 2021-02-16 12:00:55 I'm also good at the game but I don't blatantly go out of my way to flex on people who are new to the game. Honestly, that Mil you tried to flex with was worse than the one you tried to flex on.

yeah how about telling me why instead of just saying 2 words
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:34:59 are you telling me you want the plane to be common?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:38:42 not like your builds are too good either

'It's bad' isn't criticism though is it
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:40:43 I said, 'It's bad' isn't criticism, is it.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:43:17 Go ahead. I'll wait. I'm not bothered if they're 'simple minded' I want constructive criticism, not just you being a bag of shit, trying to piss me off.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:46:17 Ok, thanks for some actual criticism.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 11:57:07 That was about my A-10, where the sides are flat like the real thing. If you seriously need to bring up previous arguments then you can't construct something based on the current argument. Not everyone here attempts *constructive* criticism. A few people have responded with 'It's bad' just like you did. The A-10 which you just brought up and where I commented about the 130000 motor locks needed to do something with the side of the fuselage was unneeded on my end, but you bringing it up again is just restarting unneeded drama that wasn't called for.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:08:49 you still think 'It's bad' is constructive and that's pretty cringe. You literally said it before and that's the reason this argument started <:LULW:719972409947717727>

Does it look like I give a single fuck in hell how long my sentence is? This is an argument, not a dong measuring contest
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:11:10 yeah, i found this pretty entertaining <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:15:40 it's not an overuse, it all has a function. Also, the A-10's fuselage did in fact have flat sides! If you need a reference, just check every single fucking image of an A-10 on earth. I used references, I build to the best of my ability. Also, the 'It's bad' was the reason this argument started. I apologise that I didn't see your statement of an apparent 'overuse of motorlock'. Downvoting a build because it has a lot of motorlocks doesn't seem very logical to me.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:25:48 The plane is actually very light and the center of balance is perfect, It only uses 6 super rockets to propel it forwards to a speed of 533sps. Also, I didn't plan on changing the fuselage. I angled it etc.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:29:47 Ok, I thought I saw someone say something about the sides of the A-10, I apologise and I don't go back to look through arguments often because I'm frankly not bothered. I deleted the A-10 because I, too, thought it was a massive bag of shit which is why I spoke about bringing up past arguments.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:32:16 woah, is that temp's mom?

creations-chat 2021-05-04 21:16:06 <@!492815944666578975> imo you should custom angle the hull and try and find a smaller alternative to the barrels on the turrets

creations-chat 2021-05-22 15:09:22 <@!546223347025969164> feedback on my tank?
creations-chat 2021-05-22 15:11:23 theres no such thing as half block wide tracks <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-05-22 15:13:28 there is literally no 0.5 wide tracks, and this was my reference
creations-chat 2021-05-22 15:15:33 im not making the 105, and  a half wedge would be too thick

trapdoors are 1 wide, not 0.5

well i guess my tank will lose its ability to manouver properly

and its suspension

creations-chat 2021-07-17 08:39:17 i saw what was said in a #dumbfucks channel and came here to reply:

Skillet, you literally brag about your ‘skill’ to newcomers once they post a build that you’ve already done, sometimes, their build is LITERALLY better than yours. I do not think you have the authority to call people out on what’s ‘low effort’ or what isn’t. You seem to have high standards that you can’t even seem to meet yourself. And yet, the audacity you have to call someone out and try to get them banned because of some builds they posted? Fucking astonishing.

creations-chat 2021-07-21 13:49:23 youve never pulled an all-nighter?
creations-chat 2021-07-22 19:31:29 im just gonna say that the canopy is different to how it actually looks, theres a half wedge there, not 2 full blocks on the angled part, if i did trails the motor wouldve been exposed

the one thing i was hoping not to get on the build was exposed motors and i somehow subconciously managed to essentially achive that

the only motors i couldnt hide were on the wings but thats obviously something thats there for functionality and can be easily removed

creations-chat 2021-08-04 00:01:22 sorry but, i cant fix it, my apologies. i limited myself with space because i want it to be a small, agile build and its getting heavy for its size anyway, fixing that would require more motorlock, more space and more weight capacity

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:00:49 numerous things actually, you’re part of the community with the highest animal abuse rates and bestiality rates. furries fantasize about being animals, which is genuinely strange. You guys throw away hundreds to thousands of dollars on fursuits when you can easily spend the money on something productive or even donate to charities for those in need. Being a furry puts you more at risk of attacks such as DDoS, real-life attacks and more. The furry community is not safe and it is gaining a worse population by the day, so sadly being a furry is not the way to go.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:01:19 on mobile too
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:02:05 so i would attack furries via DDos attacks and assault?

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:02:48 no, because a gender is a part of *human* life, not people trying to be a fucking wolf
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:03:17 i do not have anything wrong with the lgbt, im lgbt myself

creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:10:55 yes, they often had animals on the vertical stabiliser

i added a buffalo because theyre pretty hefty, and the 2 horns could represent the 2 guided missiles at the front of the plane which i will soon add along with the fuselage fins
general 2021-11-26 00:16:28 so you can post a piece of shit in creations im guessing?
general 2021-11-26 00:20:47 dms
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:31:08 yeah i know, didnt have much time though so i had to improvise

<@!698587744842022983> not on my PC right now but im going off documents which state the wing angle is 60°, and im using delta wing 1x2s which are 60°
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:34:40 no, blueprints are unreliable due to perspective and direct angle
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:36:41 yeah i know about the mini angle thing, but i had like 30 minutes to do the wings and because of a certain area of motorlock it will be a fuck to make the wings look good
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:17:09 well exactly, there is a smaller angled piece and the cockpit does merge, however i can make the merge less sadge like i planned
creations-chat 2021-11-26 11:02:42 SSC Tuatara
creations-chat 2021-11-27 16:13:33 need to fix a couple issues then im done

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 16:52:01 pros of having a highly motorlocked build: looks cool
cons of having a highly motorlocked build: painful to spawn, resetting motors, lag, accidental powered unlocked motors, angling and piston length...

my first build in 4 months

a first design, i barely make rotors

most likely impossible to hide the motors due to a lack of space and effort because im a lazy shit
creations-chat 2022-02-24 22:21:12 made a new prototype

creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:31:55 
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:36:01 theres some cool engineering, for example the rear prop and horizontal/vertical stabilizer moves when you switch modes
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:38:17 exactly, it's meant to be very sci-fi. The paint scheme is mildly resemblant of russian military aviation. 70s and 80s USSR projects were very outlandish, which is what I was hoping to achieve. I was trying to make something strange with could've been a USSR design concept that was never fully endorsed, such as the MiL V-12.
creations-chat 2022-02-25 00:40:30 lmao, but tell me this doesnt look like some shitbarge the russians woulda made

creations-chat 2022-04-24 08:21:27 i’ve already said it before about your other builds, the colors are too vibrant considering its an articulated construction/demolition vehicle. the ladders you use for detail(?) just look really off too.

general 2022-11-10 07:19:31 i look in creations sometimes and the builds from new people are getting progressively worse and the amount of pros is getting increasingly lower

i’m applying to work on PC2
general 2022-12-14 15:52:16 Zap pew pow brrt space gun
general 2022-12-14 15:53:00 They are wings, it’s inspired by modern Sci-Fi and Eve Online based ships.
general 2022-12-14 15:53:43 I mean who wouldn’t want to see miniguns and railguns in PC2 fr
general 2022-12-14 15:54:52 I mean, other ships have it in modern media. I don’t see why I can’t too ahaha
general 2022-12-14 15:56:20 Thanks, it’s just a quick one I did for fun. I was wondering if maybe you could suggest an item you’d like to see in PC2, then I could model it and maybe use it to apply for the PC2 development team?
general 2022-12-14 15:57:12 should i remaster the PC1 gun then
general 2022-12-14 15:58:36 ez lowpoly van (suce my Ball)
general 2022-12-14 15:59:19 Low enough they’re only 1.4k each
general 2022-12-14 15:59:50 No.
general 2022-12-14 16:00:38 Screw it bruh. I’m finna model a new gun, bomb, and missile for PC2 and apply. wish me luck
general 2022-12-14 16:01:18 it says in the announcement
general 2022-12-14 16:02:12 show your best past work, what your strong points are etc
general 2022-12-14 16:05:11 Shade smooth not found
general 2022-12-14 16:06:03 when did i say i’m finna be a saviour. I said i’m gonna model sum and apply for the dev job. Sit down and read the room
general 2022-12-14 16:07:53 bruh didn’t even cook me. he didn’t even see the context
general 2022-12-14 16:08:36 understandable, game is dry asf
general 2022-12-14 16:09:21 you’re so quick to assume i mean the game and not the development
general 2022-12-14 16:10:22 the game only gets updated for summer and winter, and it’s the same context every year. it’s appropriate to say the game has dried out, and the delay of PC2 over understandable reasons supports that point 🤷‍♂️
general 2022-12-14 16:11:24 specifically game development, there’s still a lot of players but it’s mainly newer players now
general 2022-12-14 16:12:00 💀
general 2022-12-14 16:12:40 eh
general 2022-12-14 16:13:40 well, compared to last years 2k ish players it’s beginning to die surely. PC2 is what’s needed imo
general 2022-12-14 16:14:54 yes, in due time. i’m just hoping my application is accepted and i can help development. i can model, and i’m likely going to try and model some revamped plane crazy stuff like the gun model, missile model etc
general 2022-12-14 16:15:42 burn

general 2023-01-21 22:30:31 Yep
general 2023-01-21 22:30:39 There’s an easier method than that
general 2023-01-21 22:31:00 Basically you half lock 4 wings all at 90 degree angles to make a pointed shape
general 2023-01-21 22:31:04 And do that maybe 20 times
general 2023-01-21 22:31:09 And you have a good ass cone

general 2023-01-21 22:38:43 yeah i reposted something that got 140 upvotes a year and a half ago and it got 310 upvotes
general 2023-01-21 22:39:10 should i repost the electric lightning just to see how many noobs upvote it lmaoo
general 2023-01-21 22:39:17 what
general 2023-01-21 22:39:44 no
general 2023-01-21 22:39:56 the subreddit has about 5 active people max
general 2023-01-21 22:40:12 one of the most upvoted things on the subreddit was 1 ballast tank block
general 2023-01-21 22:40:29 how old are you
general 2023-01-21 22:40:38 no, humour is funny
general 2023-01-21 22:40:53 what the hell is the shaping on the side of the turret
general 2023-01-21 22:41:05 because your iq is room temperature
general 2023-01-21 22:41:34 your brain is decorative. its just filler so your skull doesnt cave in
general 2023-01-21 22:42:03 he doesnt need a hardhat, his thick skull does it for him
general 2023-01-21 22:42:51 dude is dense to the point where he is buoyant and cant swim underwater
general 2023-01-21 22:42:58 because you’re 12?
general 2023-01-21 22:43:08 how do you argue peacefully
general 2023-01-21 22:43:14 those words juxtapose each other
general 2023-01-21 22:43:25 dude are you 12
general 2023-01-21 22:43:28 11?
general 2023-01-21 22:43:31 at most
general 2023-01-21 22:43:33 surely
general 2023-01-21 22:44:08 because you’re such a dork that you obviously haven’t matured enough to the point where you speak coherently
general 2023-01-21 22:44:33 he looking like when stewie griffin ingested the toxic waste
general 2023-01-21 22:44:52 
general 2023-01-21 22:45:08 i think that reflects onto you
general 2023-01-21 22:45:27 i’m coping fine, you’re the one getting offended because i assumed your age
general 2023-01-21 22:45:45 i think anyone would assume your age because of how you act
general 2023-01-21 22:46:01 how is that racist?
general 2023-01-21 22:46:12 he’s not assuming your race or making fun of it
general 2023-01-21 22:46:21 therefore it isn’t racism
general 2023-01-21 22:47:01 that’s not racist, if it were to be assumed it would be ableist
general 2023-01-21 22:47:14 however it’s literally not affecting you in anyway
general 2023-01-21 22:47:31 you are using the language barrier as an excuse to victimize yourself
general 2023-01-21 22:48:16 i’m sure i’ve heard of entersat before, no joke i’m sure i banned him from boxness for being unde or something, that’s why his user is entersat2
general 2023-01-21 22:48:21 no it is
general 2023-01-21 22:48:37 his bus is wider than the pacific ocean
general 2023-01-21 22:49:05 no it’s all just completely subpar
general 2023-01-21 22:49:39 
general 2023-01-21 22:50:07 i never thought my builds were good
general 2023-01-21 22:50:23 my l3/33c got 20 upvotes and it was my first build
general 2023-01-21 22:50:29 there’s always room for improvement
general 2023-01-21 22:50:48 that gives me an idea

general 2023-04-10 17:15:56 goofy ahh name ong
general 2023-04-10 17:16:16 autism at its finest
general 2023-04-10 17:16:33 why do you need a plane that goes mach 5 though
general 2023-04-10 17:16:36 on a serious note
general 2023-04-10 17:17:02 if you're making your planes go incredibly fast it just proves that you can't pvp effectively
general 2023-04-10 17:17:51 pvp in plane crazy is about close combat and strategy until you get some goon with a shredder or some random ass OP weapon system
general 2023-04-10 17:18:01 that's the issue
general 2023-04-10 17:18:36 you're an actual moron if you're using conveyor drives or anything that makes your plane incredibly fast unless it's for realism and not PVP
general 2023-04-10 17:19:15 FtRookie made a missile which uses a .py (or something else) script that can target specific players and track them
general 2023-04-10 17:19:26 it's a homing missile
general 2023-04-10 17:19:29 really effective
general 2023-04-10 17:19:55 it might use Roblox's LUA or an external program
general 2023-04-10 17:19:57 i forgot honestly
general 2023-04-10 17:20:14 no
general 2023-04-10 17:20:18 not for you
general 2023-04-10 17:20:41 people with I and II ranks are just as bad as whitenames <@467765396108476426>
general 2023-04-10 17:21:31 i should make a script that uses roblox's LUA to find country of origin and find the IP and personal information of these 4 types of people
general 2023-04-10 17:21:50 with roblox scripting you can use locationservices to blacklist people of a certain country from your game
general 2023-05-03 10:19:22 New workplace, starting in september

general 2023-05-15 18:37:16 i swear there’s always some rеtards bullying whitenames and trying to discourage them from building, then proceeding to cry ‘wHy iS pLaNe cRaZy DyInG?!?!’ like they aren’t one of the root causes

general 2023-07-05 05:34:32 oh yeah in the past year of course, i just mean generally
general 2023-07-05 05:35:24 95% of new people suck ass because oldheads and good builders are too full of pride and reluctancy to teach newbies how to build
general 2023-07-05 05:35:41 well yeah
general 2023-07-05 05:35:44 including me
general 2023-07-05 05:36:05 i dont think im gonna even return to PC, let alone PC2
general 2023-07-05 05:36:34 it’s a generalization, it doesn’t specifically involve you
general 2023-07-05 05:36:46 in this discord whitename is literally a term overused
general 2023-07-05 05:37:24 unde is acceptable if the person on the receiving end is a dumbass
general 2023-07-05 05:37:41 yup
general 2023-07-05 05:38:05 someone will make some shitty joke build with a stupid caption and get Designer V because of it
general 2023-07-05 05:38:14 and then they think they can talk down
general 2023-07-05 05:39:27 wow damn almost like their name is white because theyre:

A) new to the game
B) haven’t applied for roles
C) don’t want to apply for roles
D) doesn’t care about their status in some shitty dying roblox game discord server
general 2023-07-05 05:40:15 true, used to be 65 upvotes for designer v
general 2023-07-05 05:40:44 well they can handle it, the ones who cant are usually dumbasses who are somehow insecure when playing roblox
general 2023-07-05 05:42:06 And 50% of that 75% turns out becoming huge аutists like most of the expert ranks
general 2023-07-05 05:42:14 why
general 2023-07-05 06:48:26 that has never happened
