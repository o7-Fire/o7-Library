The Tale of bluecopetitatl (307511245223755787)
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 10:16:54 Was bored, made a walking Catapult CPLT-C1.
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 10:19:19 Speaking of which, how many walking mechanisms exist for mechs? YT tutorials tend to showcase the same one.
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 10:21:47 Nah, I took it off Mechwarrior Online.
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 10:23:51 Oh no I forgot to crop it
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 11:00:35 <#495286269459300364> ?
general 2020-04-11 12:16:09 Is that symbol what I think it is?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:16:57 Anything I should try building?
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:21:06 Corvette, already done. Sub, made it amphibious because I was extra bored. Anything else?
general 2020-04-11 12:24:22 rosehip is that you
general 2020-04-11 12:24:53 I can hear the spilt tea from here...
general 2020-04-11 12:26:00 And to think I kill plenty of Crusaders in my Centurion over at Roblox Tankery.
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 12:28:00 I love flying into them with unaware newbies.


IF I HAD ANY
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 14:46:34 An M60 machine gun or an M60 Super Sherman?
plane-crazy 2020-04-12 11:14:28 Russian bias
creations-chat 2020-04-20 06:00:40 I think you need to go back to flight school.
creations-chat 2020-04-20 06:01:18 Colour it yellow, maybe then I'll upvote it
general 2020-06-21 16:50:17 Where should I go to report death threats?
general 2020-06-21 16:56:11 It's in-game.
general 2020-06-21 16:56:23 A shame the reports channel is closed.
general 2020-06-30 10:33:53 So I'm guessing only the cutters are bugged right now?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:40:00 Has the collision bug been fixed yet?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:40:19 If not, I think I found the problem.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:41:38 (This is the part where I realise I have no idea how to upload videos.)
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:41:59 Streamable? Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:49:06 Alright, streamable's been great.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:49:22 https://streamable.com/zouec4
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:50:23 I'm pretty sure the cutter blocks are one of the problems, assuming there are more.
creations-chat 2020-07-01 18:15:07 I have no idea what really happened here

But I doubt it's anything less than inappropriate.
creations-chat 2020-07-01 19:55:24 Not enough forks
creations-chat 2020-07-09 07:44:52 Any ideas on how to build interlocking moving wheels for German heavy tanks? They're a headache to figure out.
help 2020-08-30 14:29:47 Question: How to make an oscillating turret?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 09:47:26 https://streamable.com/gc6n1e
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 09:47:31 Weird.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:14:23 Help. My sanity. This almost took up more blocks than my mech. Why.

C712 Longsword, is anything missing?
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:16:24 I know

But it's causing my potato computer problems

I really ought to upgrade it if I want to build anything beyond 1500 and not freeze my entire screen
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:19:42 I'm not sure how exactly potato it is, but I'm running full graphics and my build keeps slowing down.

At least this is better than my last laptop which could only do minimum graphics.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:21:49 Is it possible for your build to not slow down when exceeding the 1000-block mark on full graphics, for any computer?

Or is it a perfectly normal thing I'm not used to?

***Reminder to self: Get a full upgrade before attempting to lose more sanity off lag from building an Excubitor-class or whatever***
creations-chat 2021-04-20 18:26:06 I'm guessing the people here with the Master Badges are mostly only able to do so because top-notch computers?

<@!670939038999511041> Donno how exactly potato-ish this one is, but I've got a few extensive steam games downloaded on my laptop which *might* be why. Is that how it works?
