general 2020-11-28 18:15:54 nasa also made the epic project orion
general 2020-11-28 18:16:07 which is far better than st*rship
general 2020-11-28 18:17:13 and? Still doesn't compare on how epic the sls is
general 2020-11-28 18:17:58 the sls is epic

general 2020-11-28 18:18:30 it's still epic though
general 2020-11-28 18:19:06 starship is just a glorified shuttle with more fuel change my mind
general 2020-11-28 18:20:42 dear liberals
you say that the shuttle is bad and the starship is good, yet the starship is just a bigger shuttle with more fuel.
interesting.
general 2020-11-28 18:21:46 and? starship hasn't flown yet
general 2020-11-28 18:22:01 so we don't know if it might have more failures
general 2020-11-28 18:22:10 after all the shuttle only had two
general 2020-11-28 18:22:17 of tons of missions
general 2020-11-28 18:22:33 every space program did tho
general 2020-11-28 18:23:02 if nexus was approved and still operational today i'd say nexus
