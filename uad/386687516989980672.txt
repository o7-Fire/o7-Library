general 2021-04-03 22:39:56 Hi
general 2021-04-03 22:42:09 Hi CT
general 2021-04-03 23:17:44 I can't wait for Among Us to die
general 2021-04-03 23:18:50 I am very disappointed
general 2021-04-03 23:20:59 I can't understand why it got popular in the first place, it's a mediocre murder mystery game
general 2021-04-03 23:22:33 Dang
general 2021-04-03 23:22:42 Those driver horns are thin
general 2021-04-03 23:23:08 You can see mine glitching in the background lol
general 2021-04-03 23:24:04 Look at the front of Figet's Whelen
general 2021-04-03 23:24:12 Not even hollow
general 2021-04-03 23:24:29 Much nicer
general 2021-04-03 23:25:29 Shredder bug? EW
general 2021-04-03 23:27:59 Wow CT you did a bad
general 2021-04-03 23:28:36 Shredder bugs are a waste of save slots
general 2021-04-03 23:28:53 All they do is get in the way of other people's builds when not in PVP mode
general 2021-04-03 23:29:12 And they always keep bumping into my sirens and knocking my trains over
general 2021-04-03 23:29:16 I know that signal
general 2021-04-03 23:29:29 I think it's in Alabama
general 2021-04-03 23:29:37 I don't think so
general 2021-04-03 23:29:45 I'm bad at remembering names
general 2021-04-03 23:30:38 I love that signal since it's such a huge cantilever for only 2 pairs of lights and a GS e-bell
general 2021-04-03 23:33:25 Holy crap I never realized just how long that crossing gate is until now
general 2021-04-03 23:34:44 Well I made a normal gate
general 2021-04-03 23:34:49 And then decided to make it longer
general 2021-04-03 23:34:51 and longer
general 2021-04-03 23:34:57 Until this monstrosity was made
general 2021-04-03 23:36:07 The gate is so heavy that the poor gate mechanism can barely pull it back up

general 2021-04-12 07:05:55 I'm 19
general 2021-04-12 07:06:10 I don't drive
general 2021-04-12 07:06:28 The waiting list for driver's lessons is stretching into 2022
general 2021-04-12 07:06:42 So I can't start that anytime soon
general 2021-04-12 07:06:54 At least work is a 20 min walk away so it's not like I need to drive

general 2021-04-12 07:09:42 I'm a furry forever
general 2021-04-12 07:09:50 and that is the truth
general 2021-04-12 07:10:16 He already is a furry
general 2021-04-12 07:10:31 I helped with that
general 2021-04-12 07:18:01 Steamed Hams are better
general 2021-04-12 07:18:42 I like the leaves, not the stem
general 2021-04-12 07:19:17 The stems just don't taste very good
general 2021-04-12 07:29:52 I got an RTX 3070 for like 1k CAD
general 2021-04-12 07:30:13 I saw it on amazon lol
general 2021-04-12 07:30:18 and managed to get it
general 2021-04-12 07:30:27 idk
general 2021-04-12 07:30:47 Me because I have the money for it
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:31:53 What locomotive is this going to be?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:32:47 Ah, nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:33:48 
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:33:50 This is a CN grain train I made
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:47:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:47:47 Somebody wasn't a fan of the B&N Mobil Directo and destroyed it
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:48:19 Nah it's an air raid siren lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:48:39 Wow that actually does have a huge resemblance xD
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:49:56 
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 07:50:02 This is that same siren when it's intact
general 2021-04-16 21:06:10 I have a 3070 lol
general 2021-04-16 21:07:54 
general 2021-04-16 21:08:20 Because Dawg said I don't have one lol
general 2021-04-16 21:08:56 I had a 1060-3GB before I got the 3070
general 2021-04-16 21:10:39 Those cards are midrange cards which is why they're considered "poor"
general 2021-04-16 21:10:53 Even though if you have a GPU at ALL in the current market you should be happy
general 2021-04-16 21:13:29 Yikes. I sold my old 5700XT for 800 and I thought THAT was pushing it
general 2021-04-16 21:14:31 If you're going with a small form facot
general 2021-04-16 21:14:33 factor PC
general 2021-04-16 21:14:43 Then water coolers would probably fit a lot better
general 2021-04-16 21:14:55 Hmm
general 2021-04-16 21:15:40 If you don't mind the brown, the Noctua NH-L9i is a good bet
general 2021-04-16 21:16:17 37x95x95mm
general 2021-04-16 21:16:32 Yes
general 2021-04-16 21:16:34 Very small
general 2021-04-16 21:18:06 Cooler Master has the G100M
general 2021-04-16 21:18:11 Which is a 100mm air cooler
general 2021-04-16 21:18:20 That'd probably fit just fine
general 2021-04-16 21:19:39 Socket 1200 is really new
general 2021-04-16 21:19:41 That's why
general 2021-04-16 21:20:08 Probably not anytime soon
general 2021-04-16 21:20:27 I just looked it up
general 2021-04-16 21:20:47 Apparently socket 1150 coolers are completely compatible with socket 1200
general 2021-04-16 21:20:53 So you can use one of those
general 2021-04-16 21:21:16 "The 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard are placed in a square with a lateral length of 75 mm for Intel's sockets LGA 1156, LGA 1155, LGA 1150, LGA 1151 and LGA 1200. Cooling solutions should therefore be interchangeable"
general 2021-04-16 21:22:07 Yes
general 2021-04-16 21:22:20 Any 115x cooler should work
general 2021-04-16 21:24:37 Yes
general 2021-04-16 21:24:39 They will work
general 2021-04-16 21:37:07 For today's prices? Yes
general 2021-04-16 21:37:37 That looks like a pretty good price for a budget oriented build
general 2021-04-16 22:02:54 FYI, do NOT use UserBenchmark for comparing parts
general 2021-04-16 22:03:00 They're a complete joke
general 2021-04-16 22:03:52 UserBenchmark is known for its extreme bias against AMD to the point that they actively change their benchmarking tool to favour Intel and Nvidia parts
general 2021-04-16 22:04:03 It's so bad that the site is banned from r/intel on Reddit
general 2021-04-16 22:04:37 The site claims that an Intel i3-9100F is better than high end Ryzen CPUs
general 2021-04-16 22:04:47 Which is just blatantly wrong
general 2021-04-16 22:05:26 The site is not a reliable source of information
general 2021-04-16 22:12:13 Probably versus.com or something like that, but that isn't the most reliable either
general 2021-04-16 22:12:21 Still better than UserBenchmark though
general 2021-04-16 22:16:02 Good luck with your new build!
general 2021-04-18 15:31:47 I also have a 3070
general 2021-04-18 15:31:52 And a Ryzen 5 3600XT
general 2021-04-18 15:32:29 7th gen is still decent but it's showing its age
general 2021-04-18 15:32:35 Oh wait
general 2021-04-18 15:32:38 11th gen
general 2021-04-18 15:32:48 Did you get the 11700K?
general 2021-04-18 15:35:14 I'm thinking of upgrading to a 5800X cpu
general 2021-04-18 15:35:39 It'll be a nice combo with my 3070
general 2021-04-19 01:56:58 Sas is definitely furry
general 2021-04-19 01:57:03 Furry in denial
general 2021-04-19 03:50:46 Siren Head is garbage
general 2021-04-19 03:50:53 I would not be sad if he stepped on a lego
general 2021-08-19 20:53:42 Sweet! Now my giant tornado sirens won't take 15 seconds to load
general 2021-08-19 20:54:29 I wonder if plot size will be increased
general 2021-08-19 20:54:32 I hope so
general 2021-08-19 20:56:01 I'm excited in general, this is gonna be a good update
general 2021-08-19 20:56:54 You can't really judge until it's out
general 2021-09-10 02:57:00 What
general 2021-09-10 02:57:18 Oh great
general 2021-09-10 02:57:25 Someone's impersonating me
general 2021-09-10 02:59:02 I'm the actual Snowpix, not that other kid
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 20:39:34 Rude
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 20:39:48 jk
creations-chat 2021-10-04 02:16:25 Its sound is unique to that model of siren, 7/10 port
creations-chat 2021-10-05 22:07:47 Wow lol
creations-chat 2021-10-24 23:27:48 Well, this siren isn't rusty and can't walk, so I think you'll be fine.
creations-chat 2021-10-24 23:41:40 It has 8 horns inside a shroud that attach to the chopper and stator that make the sound
creations-chat 2021-10-24 23:52:58 This is the siren without the shroud, so you can see all 8 horns. The horns were repainted to a much darker gray after this was taken
creations-chat 2021-10-24 23:55:28 I made that, and I made it because I'm a siren enthusiast and the game gives me all the tools I need to build one. I get enjoyment from making these huge builds function and take shape. I was one of the first to build giant sirens and a lot of people are doing the same now
general 2021-12-18 05:32:41 Too bad, China has no power over me!
general 2021-12-18 05:33:11 Yup lol
general 2021-12-18 05:35:18 They'll never take me alive
general 2021-12-18 05:35:49 Yup, I am a furry
general 2021-12-18 05:36:19 A furry and a siren enthusiast, big surprise
general 2021-12-18 05:36:59 You better cut that out, you're gonna hurt yourself with all that facepalming
general 2021-12-18 05:38:20 That's the blower which feeds air into the siren
general 2021-12-18 05:38:24 The belt sucks and breaks all the time
creations-chat 2022-01-15 02:42:17 And?
bug-reports 2022-01-17 22:42:53 Is anyone else's builds saying that they're saved, and then reverting again when you join another game? I've rebuilt something like 3 times now, and every time I join a new game after saving it reverts to before I saved it every time
bug-reports 2022-01-17 22:43:22 Can't make any more progress on my build since it just reverts every time
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:48:30 So, I can't save anything on my main on Plane Crazy anymore. Any time I try to save any of my builds to another save slot, it says "saved successfully!" but when I leave the game and rejoin, that save will disappear. If I edit a build and save it, it will revert when I rejoin as if I never saved in the first place. However, deleting builds works just fine and it will save if I delete a build. I've only used half of the save data available. So I'm basically unable to play the game anymore since I can't save my builds. When I try saving builds on my alt, it works normally. It's only my main that's having this problem
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:49:19 I've tried saving with different save slots, and with different builds, all the same result. It'll just revert when I join another lobby.
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:50:32 This was when I saved after finally finishing my build
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:50:53 
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:50:54 And now.
bug-reports 2022-01-18 22:51:46 
bug-reports 2022-01-19 06:19:58 It still doesn't save in private servers, I haven't checked if PVP will fix it
bug-reports 2022-01-19 06:23:20 And just checked, it doesn't save in PVP servers either
bug-reports 2022-01-19 06:23:34 The entire save function is broken for me
bug-reports 2022-01-19 22:36:09 Thing is, I deleted one of my old builds to test this, and the bug still persists even though I have more save data now
bug-reports 2022-01-19 22:36:30 It saves when I delete a build, but won't save new ones
bug-reports 2022-01-20 01:53:31 So does anyone know why the saving is completely broken? I can't play the game until I can find a fix. and I'm all out of ideas.
bug-reports 2022-01-20 02:09:54 Thanks, very helpful statement.
bug-reports 2022-01-20 03:09:53 xD
bug-reports 2022-01-20 03:10:22 Really though, being a furry is completely irrelevant to the fact that my game is completely broken and nobody seems to know what's wrong with it
bug-reports 2022-01-20 03:10:42 And until it's fixed, I can't play the game
bug-reports 2022-01-20 03:32:21 Well, that sounds like it's gonna be a while lol
bug-reports 2022-01-21 00:04:17 Update on my save problem, it's definitely an issue with max save data. I was able to save a 1.7k block build just fine, but the 4k block build I want to save won't.
bug-reports 2022-01-21 00:08:37 I'm testing with a few builds, the max I've been able to save is a 2.3k block build. 2.5k reverted just like everything else.
bug-reports 2022-01-21 00:15:10 This seems to be the save data limit for me, nothing will save above this limit.
bug-reports 2022-01-24 01:30:19 New bug, when I unanchor my builds, it has a complete seizure and breaks every fold instantly, and now my build is half stuck in the ground.
bug-reports 2022-01-24 01:30:30 
bug-reports 2022-01-29 23:06:20 Still can't play Plane Crazy at all on my main, since saving is still broken...
bug-reports 2022-01-29 23:08:09 Irrelevant to the problem at hand.
bug-reports 2022-02-01 00:42:19 I find pistons also have a seizure and break if they move too fast lol
bug-reports 2022-02-01 00:42:57 The piston part comes detached, and if it goes TOO fast anything it's attached to will go flying at the speed of light into the sky
creations-chat 2022-02-01 23:21:22 Meanwhile I post sirens just to shake things up a bit lol
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:26:42 Still can't save at all on my main, my builds just revert every time I leave the game and join a different server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:27:30 Spam-saving, deleting builds to make more save room, going to different gamemodes, nothing works. The only time I've been able to save ANYTHING on my main was when I switched a speaker ID to a different one.
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:27:55 It's like the game just straight up isn't carrying my data from server to server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:28:18 I'm at a loss here, I've tried everything.
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:36:31 I don't think speakers are what's causing it, the speakers are just the only thing that will save, likely because it doesn't change the sava data much
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:36:47 I think it's some sort of data issue with carrying data from server to server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:37:00 Because I can save and load builds even after changing them if they're on a single server
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:37:12 But if I go to another, it reverts as if I never saved at all
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:37:25 And this applies to autosave too, which doesn't function
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:37:47 I can spend hours on a build, autosave won't do anything, and the save itself will just revert
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:38:31 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:39:01 All of my builds are huge
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:39:46 My builds are around 5k blocks on average
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:39:57 Ok, I'll try that
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:41:41 Ok, I've got it saved
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:41:44 Now I'll rejoin
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:42:24 Okay, that did save? Wtf
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:43:26 Ok, let's see
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:44:03 This is the save data after saving this build as a test
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:44:17 It's my smallest build, copied over
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:45:10 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:45:14 And poof, reverted
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:46:36 This has been the case for a while now, it's made me completely unable to play this game
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:46:49 Nope
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:46:49 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:47:01 It's been stuck on this autosave for a while now
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:47:17 Which is a slightly older version of a build I was working on
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:47:24 Yeah, I've tried before, no dice
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:47:29 I'll give it another try, just in case
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:48:14 Ok, let's see
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:48:54 Well, the save stayed this time
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:49:22 Now I'll try one of the bigger builds, and see if it sticks too
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:50:41 Nope!
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:50:55 Just reverted back to the 1680 autosave
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:51:25 4644
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:51:37 It's a build I've tried working on 4 times
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:51:42 and reverted every time
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:51:59 I've even tried saving tiny bits at a time (less than 200 at a time usually) and didn't work
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:54:37 I've posted about this before in the chat with some other experiments I've tried with saving
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:54:59 .
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:55:59 And saving works fine on my alt with equally big builds, this issue's only affecting my main.
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:56:47 That's what I was thinking
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:56:56 Idk if anyone else has used as much as I do
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:57:04 I'm sure there are but idk
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:58:15 I have a friend who has also used around 2 mil save data with no problems, I'm asking him if he can get his save data up to my data
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:58:45 Let me see
bug-reports 2022-02-12 01:59:21 This is pre-saving
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:00:11 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:00:12 And post saving
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:00:23 No errors other than those sound errors that always happen
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:01:08 It's just my main
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:01:31 My friend is getting his save data to the same as mine, to see if he can replicate it
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:02:41 This is my save data when I save the build I want to autosave
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:03:54 And I saved a much larger build to autosave to see what it said on the dev console, still no errors. And it of course reverted when I rejoined
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:04:47 I completely recoloured a build earlier, with no visible change to the save data, and that reverted too, if that helps
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:05:02 Though it was like a 7k block build that I recoloured
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:07:02 And moving to other gamemodes like PVP didn't help either, tried that
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:08:17 I also did an experiment here a while ago
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:10:26 And I notice by searching the word "revert" in the server that I'm not the only one who's been affected by this, a few other people have complained about the exact same issue
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:14:31 CT, try saving once your data is close to this
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:22:04 Yup
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:22:11 Ok
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:04 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:24 And that's pre-revert
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:25:48 My friend ctdcgameing is very close, he's at 2 mil
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:26:11 I'm having him get his save data to as high as mine, to see if he'll have the same problem
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:26:28 Yes?
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:26:53 Just messaged him
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:31:21 Block, I know your saves are working properly
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:31:25 You just want the badge
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:57:05 
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:57:11 I've managed to save up to here without reverting
bug-reports 2022-02-12 02:59:11 And I've saved as high as this without reverting
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:01:23 He's working his way up there again since he reverted too, going above that
bug-reports 2022-02-12 03:53:53 This is the highest I can get before reverting
bug-reports 2022-02-12 04:00:40 Good
bug-reports 2022-02-12 04:40:52 I'm sacrificing some old unused builds to get some save space
bug-reports 2022-02-12 23:19:24 This is what usually works for me when that happens
bug-reports 2022-02-14 00:31:56 4 gigs of DDR3 is woefully inadequate nowadays, but it's Roblox so it should be fine
bug-reports 2022-02-14 00:38:01 Oh
bug-reports 2022-02-14 00:38:42 Pretty sure that the laptop still uses DDR3, since that's what 4th gen Intels use
bug-reports 2022-02-14 00:38:46 It's just a laptop DIMM
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:10:02 Why does it bother you so much?
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:14:42 It's called having hobbies that you're passionate about, and the large scale allows for more detail. But I understand your confusion.
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:21:33 It's the pride of making a gigantic build that works, and is very accurate to the real thing. So what if people don't like it, or understand it, doesn't matter to me. I still enjoy making these functional scale models.
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:25:21 You'd be surprised, the siren enthusiast community's actually quite large. So is the railfanning community. Hell, there are ceiling fan enthusiasts. If there's something that exists, there's likely an enthusiast community behind it. It's no different than being an aviation enthusiast, or a military enthusiast.
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:28:08 Doesn't make the hobby any more or less valid. People will enjoy what they enjoy, even if it's something as simple as loud machines that spin. And yes, ceiling fan enthusiasts do in fact exist. There's also elevator enthusiasts, car wash enthusiasts, HVAC enthusiasts, traffic light enthusiasts, railroad crossing signal enthusiasts, etc, etc etc
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:33:14 Closest thing I've done to that is a couple of trains, which are pretty good in their own right considering I managed to squeeze about 5-6 railcars per train at the scale they're at
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:37:30 That's one of them, not finished yet
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:44:12 The siren's sound, reliability, rarity, and historical value are what people in the community usually find interesting about sirens.
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 00:46:11 That would be easy to make. It's a Chinese ripoff of the loudest siren ever made, the Chrysler Victory Bell siren.
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 00:46:39 
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 00:47:30 Chrysler did, back in the 1950s, and it still holds the record for loudest siren at 138db at 100ft
plane-crazy 2022-03-03 00:48:26 Uses a 150HP FirePower Hemi V8
creations-chat 2022-03-03 00:57:57 I already have, argument invalid <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2022-03-03 02:04:23 This is what my old builds looked like before I improved at the game, everybody starts somewhere.
creations-chat 2022-03-03 02:06:55 You're entitled to your opinion, doesn't matter to me.
creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:18:02 Just because you're an asshole doesn't make your opinion any more valid :P
creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:53:41 Wow, what a comeback!
creations-chat 2022-03-03 16:57:26 Don't care in the slightest :)
creations-chat 2022-03-03 17:00:48 Haters gonna hate!
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:17:58 Helpful tips instead of insults? In <#504436696021204992>? Impossible.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:20:25 You have a point, can't argue with people who never had anything of substance to say in the first place
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:49:01 What's so bad about siren enthusiasts vs enthusiasts of anything else? It's a hobby.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:52:48 Perhaps it isn't interesting to you, but everybody's got their own interests. You don't have to understand it at all, it's just a thing. Hell, I don't know why I like sirens myself, I just do. There's entire communities I'm a part of because of it.
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:14:35 You act like we've personally hurt you with the siren builds, it's actually funny how upset it makes you guys lol
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:17:25 Pfff, no. Siren Head's not an actual siren, just a poorly made fictional character lol
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:19:31 Lol, not really!
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:25:25 Never!
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:27:59 There's siren head
creations-chat 2022-03-04 01:31:15 :O I built something that isn't a siren!
bug-reports 2022-03-07 19:26:49 My VIP didn't have snow, and it does the update thing
bug-reports 2022-03-07 19:27:10 After roughly a minute it sends me to the update place
bug-reports 2022-03-07 19:27:24 And yes, it's still happening
creations-chat 2022-06-29 02:13:30 How predictable
creations-chat 2022-06-29 02:16:20 Hate and downvote all you like, doesn't matter to me lol
bug-reports 2022-09-10 00:50:38 Anyone know why shooting people with guns or rockets causes parts of their build to suspend in the air like it's anchored, while they can still fly the rest of their plane as if it's undamaged even when it looks like the wings and stuff are gone?
bug-reports 2022-09-10 00:50:58 Makes PVP a real pain when you have to chase invisible planes
bug-reports 2022-09-10 00:51:34 How much save data have you used?
bug-reports 2022-09-10 00:52:00 It's known that saving stops working above roughly 2.1 million
bug-reports 2022-09-10 19:37:49 Yes, as long as your save doesn't go above 2.1 mil it will save
bug-reports 2022-09-10 19:38:27 It's because Plane Crazy has a 4MB limit for player saves, which 2.1 mil is about the same as
