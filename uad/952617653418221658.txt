creations-chat 2022-12-04 00:20:47 I was lazy with the flag
creations-chat 2022-12-07 11:11:15 9 times out of 10, the builds in creations are crap
bug-reports 2023-01-16 00:00:21 There is a bug going on with my rockets where if I fire them, they appear hundreds of studs away to the point where i can't fly up to them
bug-reports 2023-03-15 20:33:55 I think motor2's have gotten even more buggy cause when i spawn in my F-15, or any jet for that matter, the motors refuse to move properly
bug-reports 2023-03-15 20:34:52 They also have a tendency to flutter even though I don't have stacked motor 2's
bug-reports 2023-03-15 20:35:32 hm
bug-reports 2023-03-15 20:36:09 Then again pc is deteriorating by the second so I shouldn't be supprised.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:34:28 Indeed. Plane crazy has been deteriorating for a long time now, and something of this scale was inevitable. The Plane Crazy Apocalypse has finally come to finish this game off.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:37:44 If Rick want’s to save this game, or at the very least the supposed sequel pc2, he needs to get his rear in gear and start hiring more devs that still care about the game, and it’s community.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:37:56 Then again
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:38:16 He probably has given up and moved on to something else by now.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:14 Welcome to the end times.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:25 Pc had a good run
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:47 I mean
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:49 Yeah
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:19 It is
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:24 That I can confirm
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:41 Cursed tank simulator has been effected as well
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:42:12 Or just neglect as a whole
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:43:54 They better
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:45:18 Also, I think the reason pc pretty much never gets events or changes/fixes is cause the code is a absolute dumpster fire and is impossible to work with
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:46:24 Except the god awful 2014 coding
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:46:35 I can’t even properly use fireworks anymore
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:46:47 And for a while couldn’t use missiles at all
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:47:37 Performance issues, more and more bugs
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:48:20 Basically the severely outdated 2014 hardcod
bug-reports 2023-03-16 17:11:24 wait fr?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 17:12:36 oh they did
creations-chat 2023-03-28 15:22:27 Indeed
bug-reports 2023-04-03 22:36:12 this happened not too long ago so it likely will revert
creations-chat 2023-05-22 22:34:16 That's what I'm sayin
