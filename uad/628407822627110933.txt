general 2020-06-01 06:22:15 Tomorrow is pridefall which is a cyber attack event, on all social media platforms including discord there will be people trying to send you gore, extreme profanity, porn, racist slurs, and there will also be ip grabbers hackers and doxxers. I advise no one to accept any friend requests from people you don't know, stay safe. Please pass this on to any servers that you own or have admin perms and can server ping in to spread awareness. I wish you all safety. Also, make sure to be offline tomorrow which gives you less chance for this to happen to you.
