plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:48:57 how to not be shit at this game i have 13 days played and the only things i can do well are turrets and weird gadget things
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:49:44 i have a very basic idea of how those work but no idea how to actually use them for anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:50:44 i know generally how they work i just dont know how id use them for anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:52:48 they just bring things closer
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:52:58 i could just build things closer to achieve the same effect
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:54:30 ???
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:56:23 yes you make that by selling your soul to madattak
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:57:10 well i have no idea how this is made using something that brings blocks closer together
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 05:59:35 i have they bring things closer together and allow for overlaps but the overlaps cant really do that much
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 06:00:57 isnt it the spinny camera thing that does alot?
