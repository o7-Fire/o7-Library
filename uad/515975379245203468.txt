The Tale of FlamerCody12 (515975379245203468)
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 19:04:06 I wish Plane Crazy had more weapon types. I'm sick of evil triangles, sluggish to insanely fast rockets, and a weak gun. Fireworks are okay, but it's not enough for me.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:43:51 wish there were more weapons in Plane Crazy, like a lot more
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:45:40 like, naval cannons and heavy flak and such
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:46:42 Like, I could use a cannon that flies faster than a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:47:24 I just want more weapon choice, and yes
general 2020-10-15 21:55:23 I upvote pretty much any suggestion that has to do with weapons, the only one I haven't that I can recall is the "Recoil Gun"
general 2020-10-15 21:57:12 The best weapon suggestion is the one with the varying gun calibers and __mm cannons
general 2020-10-15 22:11:03 ... So you disagree that the caliber/slug gun suggestion and mm weapon suggestion are the most high quality and greatest weapon suggestions?
general 2020-10-15 22:14:00 Having more gun calibers would be pretty neat for the game, but weapons like 30mm and 88mm cannons would be nice.
general 2020-10-15 22:15:37 The only flak option in-game besides weak gunfire is fireworks, and they have trash range.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:21:00 More weaponry, like 30mm and 88mm weapons would be great too.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:28:16 Rockets have too low velocity to be much good against aircraft from a distance and at the same time too powerful against ground vehicles since they can't dodge them, guns are just meh because they don't do much damage alone, fireworks have too limited range to be any good against aircraft or really anything at a moderate distance, and lava spitters are I guess okay due to their niche, TNT and Cutters are too.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:33:55 If there were weapons like actual flak weapons, those could actually balance the current Plane Crazy worm/snake/cutter meta because currently, guns and fireworks barely can kill a single cutter. Rocket's do better but they have quite the reload and don't always hit them.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:36:27 Having Cannons would make ground PVP better in my opinion, because with them you could actually have longer distance battles that don't devolve into who spams the most rockets on their box car or who also spams the most guns and gets close enough.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:39:00 I honestly don't care whether if it's a black powder cannon or a tiny 45mm, Any cannon would do
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:39:32 120+ people who upvoted naval cannon suggestion:
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:41:14 Suggestion #7259
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:46:05 I can live without configuration, as long as it's there.
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 22:48:52 It's not nearly as compact though, is it?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:34:49 Thinking about smaller cannons, less firerate but more damage
general 2020-10-16 17:50:49 Why are West Asians called Middle Eastern?
general 2020-10-16 17:51:48 They aren't in the middle of Asia or Europe.
general 2020-10-16 17:53:05 It's not in the Middle of the East. That would be about where Kazakhstan is.
general 2020-10-16 17:53:43 East usually describes Asia, right?
general 2020-10-16 17:54:19 The Middle East isn't in the Middle of Asia!
general 2020-10-16 17:54:36 If anything, it's West Asia!
general 2020-10-16 17:55:25 Why do people call it the Middle East if it's in West Asia?
general 2020-10-16 17:56:35 If China is East Asia, then what is the center of Asia?
general 2020-10-16 17:56:46 The Middle East is western asia.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 00:53:27 Mainly it's the cockpit. It just doesn't look right. <@!716757923103244348>
general 2020-10-18 01:50:47 yeah
general 2020-10-18 01:52:13 Hey, wait a moment, am new to the server, why do you and madattak constantly switch places as developer role?
help 2020-10-19 18:48:43 How strong would motor locking every gun into a single spot be?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:22:55 Wait, rifled barrels are a thing? Huh, makes sense.
general 2020-10-20 18:46:15 We shouldn't be angry at Adopt Me just because of their massive serverbase (At least this time), Roblox has FAILED to keep their DataStores safe.
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:41:35 Shredder Bugs can be countered by larger builds using a 3 Layer armor system
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:41:48 1 and 3 are normal blocks, cutters in between.
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:42:38 You can also have 4 layers of armor: 1 and 4 are normal, 2 is explosive and 3 is cutter.
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 21:34:32 Crash physics would be nice as an on and off option, right?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 14:27:07 Kookie, if you want anti infantry/light vehicles, go for guns by the barrel. If you want AA go for the top.
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 18:50:25 Fireworks need to have increased range and/or speed.
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 18:51:36 There are multiple suggestions that have to do with buffing fireworks, which many people seem to upvote. Everyone wants them to have more range at least.
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 19:03:01 Yeah, I don't see outlines.
general 2020-11-04 15:31:35 Yordan, game doesn't have moderation.
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 00:45:18 Don't know, motor lock was revived so no reason to be dead.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:45:04 I guess it's okay, for like mechanisms and similar ideas definitely
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:48:59 Probably has to do with your amount of wing panels, go to <#478584971670454284>
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:59:29 The mech legs and harrier aren't that bad honestly, people just don't like self upvoting.
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:18 yeah, me too pretty sure all of us do
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:38 spread, yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:31 ngl, would like TNT cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:54 cannons would be the best thing ever
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:20:04 impact speed is kinda that but it's not enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:21:07 kinda like the ammo idea tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:21:24 but i kinda don't
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:21:59 don't really like MG ammo that much at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:24:19 I don't even care what the bloody cannon looks like, i would like ANYTHING, even a literal cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:25:27 I just want it in game, who cares about the LOOKS GODDAMN JUST GET SOMETHING OUT THAT ISN'T A SLOW ASS ROCKET!
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:26:05 I DON'T EVEN CARE HOW IT PEES OR POOP, JUST GET SOMETHING!
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:27:57 TNT Delay.
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:36:49 look, as long as cannon exist me happy. Or TNT cylinders.
help 2020-11-07 20:18:06 ✅  Completely normal solution
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:25:59 I'm going to be very harsh here: It's terrible, the design is boxy and ugly, wing panels are poorly strapped on, every engine is very exposed, and I just don't like it. <@!683105477000822875>
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:31:43 Start fresh and make a simple plane 3 blocks wide and tall.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:33:13 Make large, individual wings, and have either all of your engines inside your build or a few, large ones. <@!683105477000822875> Enlargen your airframe and make it more plane-like.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:39:48 well it is about diarrhea lasting all day long
general 2020-11-07 22:25:11 No stupid, it's an Object blah-blah-blah!!!
general 2020-11-07 22:25:41 No, it's a Maus!
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:03:15 that's not an orange! That's a persimmon without the skin! stop lying!
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:05:22 Again, THAT'S A SKINNED PERSIMMON NOT AN ORANGE!!!
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:05:52 ✅
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:08:46 Same, I use it too
creations-chat 2020-11-07 23:18:16 <@!265819387498332160>  I like the simplicity and clean look. It's an ✅ from me.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 23:20:28 I like the tan color a lot more as it isn't as flashy, also has the person been warned yet? Probably an Alt
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:23:37 Suggestion #7777 would be pretty nice.
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:26:42 <@!568018648002723851> What do you mean by mouse guided rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:27:39 I'll like the suggestion because I am compelled by a spirit to like all weapon suggestions or get tortured (Except for you-know, *those suggestions*).
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:32:36 There's a hole in your right wing!
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:33:35 Of course they'll be back<@!754487064560402504> , tbh I wish firework range was at least 40-50
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:36:55 Infinite would be absurb, imagine box car coming at you having flares everywhere, you wouldn't be able to fight back with rockets at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:37:40 Anyways, fireworks should have more range.
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 23:39:07 Which isn't enough range to have flak, nor a good firework show.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:33:03 Maybe you could buff speed and range, but blast radius or firerate go down considerably
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:34:19 Like, the faster the firework would be the less firerate it has, or the more range the less blast radius.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:35:27 <@!368581738496131072>, why not have a suggestion chat?
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:36:11 <@!632942443536318494> Elaborate
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:38:05 Yes, please explain your thought
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:39:11 Uh no, talking about a potential suggestion idea.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:39:41 Fireworks as *not* in rockets, but the PVP weapon
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:40:19 Make custom control surfaces with motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:41:51 Metal? I thought materials don't affect the block except for fabric and ice.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:42:15 They don't, tested it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:43:30 Diamond Plates cannot be used as armor.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:43:44 Tested it, and it's been confirmed in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:45:00 TNT is kinda unreliable, you tested it multiple times?
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:45:13 Use TNT armor
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:45:37 TNT with "arm on key" is practically invincible, it's been proven many, many times
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:46:13 Pretty sure materials don't affect the build health-wise
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:49:21 Pretty sure it doesn't affect the health, I've tested it and if you're skeptical go search it up in <#478584971670454284> , for weight I do not know.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:51:35 Anyways, back to talking about fireworks and their need for extended range.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:52:27 Camera lock? Heard of piston and motor lock, not that though.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:54:07 Huh, I'll check it out.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:54:14 What are the basic principals?
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:56:28 How does it work?
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 00:58:37 Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 01:01:26 Hello.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:26:23 <@494666471943831573> What is a block placer?
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:17 <@!494666471943831573> So a block generator that makes like, TNT balls and stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:33 That actually sounds like a really good idea!
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:33:48 That would reduce tons of lag from magnets having to pull around TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:38:50 Rename it to like, a Block Generator or Printer, at the moment the Suggestion seems vague and so far the only people who know the amazing, lag reducing print function is the people looking in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:43:57 Imagine creating a missile factory to constantly bombard enemies
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 17:46:24 I don't really like the front and back slits either, they are a bit off place.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:09:10 So far the Block Generator suggestion has been going smoothly, with no dislikes.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:11:19 Imagine not being lagged to death by TNT bomb bays and a trash PC...
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:12:21 I have an okay PC, but bomb bays slightly lag me
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:15:49 Dyno isn't as bad as MEE6, but anyways imagine not needing to have a magazine or any advanced autoloading mechanism that takes up space that could be used for design and functionality on a Explosives launcher.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:24:38 When someone inevitably downvotes the Block Generator suggestion, I'm pinging them to know why.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:25:15 Yes I do!
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:31:23 Alright then, but it really isn't a bad one.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:35:51 Also, reloading bomb bays without magazines and the like
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 22:36:31 There's also no need for wedges by that logic since you can motorlock them
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:50:49 Rewriting? Like, soft coding the game rewriting?
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:52:10 Well for now I guess we remain content until the game finally gets softcoded in like, 10000 years
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:53:44 Game is spagetti code right now, something is added another thing breaks
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:54:54 What are the first priorities once the game is softcoded and bugs are patched?
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:58:05 2018, literally so old it has a neutral yellow.
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:58:27 Someone should suggest it like, now.
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:59:52 Not that easy <@!322970944303923200>!
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 16:04:34 He did say whitelist was going to be possible once he softcoded the game, which I am thinking means he's eyeing the idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 16:05:46 Wonder what part of the code he has rewritten so far
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 16:11:04 Really lame, they push smaller build and I guess it does a tiny bit of knockback to smaller shredders
help 2020-11-10 17:50:18 Okay, so I'm trying to make custom control panels, but when I try to turn both motor 2's go in a single direction instead of one going downwards and the other upwards. This is making my plane very unstable, what do I do?
help 2020-11-10 17:55:27 Changing keybinds has not helped since I am using motor 2, I have both set to inverted, when I set one to regular it can turn and roll properly but can't fly up properly, and when I change both to regular they just don't work, what do I do, do I instead use normal motors or?
help 2020-11-10 18:02:38 This is what is happening to my plane, what should I do?

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 16:45:48 Why does the AA turret have  a PVP gun but not the hull mounted MG?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:59:27 <@517437046244114462> What do you mean by gyros? Like, stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 17:00:30 It wouls be pretty neat for spaceships and large flying vehicles, so I'm upvoting.
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 03:25:49 <@746383586755870821>  What do you mean by unlocking and locking motors at will?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 13:54:52 <@456226577798135808>  What do you mean by War Thunder? Like, porting the entire game in or improving PVP?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 14:49:03 Make the front have a bunch of motorlocked explosives and cutters, and make it detachable so you could fly up into the air and rain down explosive shrapnel upon your enemies.
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 14:51:28 Grape!
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:00:09 bruh, don't talk about a war where 100% of an ethnicity's males died, if you want to, go to <#497142796961054721> , and also that halo frigate is epic

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 19:41:27 <@404203845237997568> Although I'm kind of iffy on the guided missiles (Since you could make your own), I think heat seeking missiles would be great, maybe instead of the whole creation it could be a single block of that creation.
creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:46:22 Suspension is non-existant, I like the back enough to give it a single like for that photo.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 00:59:16 maybe, in plane crazy no, they eat ambiguous fuel source.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 01:00:13 I mean, what even is the fuel source in Plane Crazy anyways? It could be oil, electricity, even like, I don't know, unobtanium or anything really.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 01:01:10 oh, ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:22:13 Feel like in suggestions uLtra mocked or insulted the actual idea of fireworks having more range, 500 is a bit way, way too much, 50 would be so much better.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:27:08 It'd be so much better if fireworks had over 20 range but less than 75, 75+ range is very overkill and would make rockets kinda obsolete.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:28:07 That would be really cool.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:32:11 Drop could actually be a good thing for artillery and mortars.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:37:44 ~~*Fireworks would literally become cannons* and the endless will they wont they limbo of people needing something like cannons, but not being able to decide what kind of cannon they want *would be completely bypassed and finally there would be something that would fill in the current void*~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:44:48 Like, anyone who saw the FTD weapon suggestion was basically hooked on it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:45:09 Remember the one from a few days ago, hating on EA? It was probably one of the best weapon suggestions, since it had lots of modularity and capability to be modified and would make very creative creation designs.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 14:59:28 Only difference is the back rotor is a prop, the other is a fan.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:01:16 Anyways, anyone remember the FTD weapons suggestion that took multiple suggestion pages?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:02:21 You know, the one with multiple types of cannons and missiles?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:02:31 And the same one that shat on EA?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:03:44 Like, a lot? I really, really like that weapons suggestion so much, it is almost perfect, at the very least for the missile ideas alone,
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:06:09 Since you would have to have every single module for a cannon to work, it would open up all sorts of designs that would be very unique and interesting.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:12:12 You could even create really accurate tank turrets, even having the autoloader/ shell ejector/machine gun ammunition in the same place as real life.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:12:59 The game is hardcoded and needs a rewrite though, so I guess the current PVP meta will stay.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:13:24 Oh wait, thinking about that, box cars would be too complicated to create.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:15:52 Right now PVP is kinda trash, I personally still like it, but I can see why a lot of people in this discord don't. It's just box cars, rocket spam and really fast box jets with rockets. There's the occasional good jet/tank, but it's not common. Also, Shredders...
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:19:34 Maybe after the rewrite we could get a system like FTD's, it would take a very, very long time to do but it would be worth it since PVP is declining and having a unique, modular PVP weapon system would reattract a lot of people.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:24:39 Like, imagine a shredder army charging at a massive Battleship, multiple size guns are firing. Then, a nearby missile cruiser opens a hatch to reveal multiple and slow but maneuverable mini-nuclear missiles and fires at the horde.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:27:59 Hardcode ruins everything, from whitelisting/co-piloting to content updating, and fixing the game. Last block update I think was either stairs or ladders, which are just blocks with changed hitboxes, and that ruined PVP more than it already was by breaking rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:30:50 wedge 1x5? More like wedge 1x7!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:37:00 I don't use beam 1x7 for that reason. I HATE THAT DAMN beam 1x7 FOR OUT OF NOWHERE SHAGGING MY wedge 1x4!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:37:43 Yeah, I don't bother with beams.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:50:21 Just fireworks and sparklers and snow thrusters, that's it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 15:51:51 Not sure what new update will happen, maybe it'll be outlines along with the same ol' winter items.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:44:16 <@!707255933201416304> That ship looks better than all of Guardians' storyline.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:45:54 I'd say it ranks an entire 40 seconds of ODST soundtrack, better than Reach gameplay.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:48:23 That's a solid 40 seconds of ODST soundtrack for sure.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:49:57 Hmm, Maybe like, a Seraph or CCS.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:51:52 Hmm, maybe one of the larger Prowlers, like the Point Blank.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:07:05 Creations, despite not having "expert" in its name, has very high expectations and standards. Admittedly some people's standards are either way too high or way too low, and some people are actually "toxic" and downvote everything out of spite of their own creations being downvoted, though they either get shunned or creations blacklisted.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:12:26 He said *Triangle*, which I don't think you can make. Haven't played for a while, can't check.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:14:22 Motorlock does solve pretty much everything, from turrets to wedge 1x7.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:16:52 Wonder what's wrong with <@!630182372444209182> 's T90, it's not even that very, very terrible. Probably the bulkiness and exposed motorlock but nobody has said anything about it so far.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:18:56 Apparently the catcher is better than the T90, despite the hard work and motorlock.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:20:28 Also, we have PVP that isn't trash doo doo (Still bad, and needs a rework after the rewrite that takes forever)
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:22:08 They already have, just some stupid point and click cannons though, and melee weapons and a few ranged ones too.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:23:46 Clunky, needs to fill in patches at the front and fuselage, but not the worst at all.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:25:44 The engine is pretty spot on, and there's custom control panels, which is nice. I can't see much of the motorlock so overall it's pretty good. The cockpit is absolute fire, I love how it blends with the fuselage.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:28:55 Just high contrast on his PC, not really filtered. Also, the front looks realistic on the car, probably why.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:31:47 Lighting.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:34:33 Motorlock is simple, just a stairway pattern. I'd show you it in a simple, digestible emoji form, but my PC would send it if I tried.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:37:35 It's a way of life, I know.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:39:40 Like, snapping a cockpit with the base of the plane, compacting tank turrets, shapes like round balls, etc.
general 2020-11-30 17:40:24 Are our intestines motor-locked inside our bodies?
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:41:14 Yes.
general 2020-11-30 17:42:40 I mean, how else can you get so much detail with so little space?
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:43:02 It will be.

plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:09:03 So Rickje, will there be anything new in the Winter Event?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:09:31 I know, thanks for working on it.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:11:29 So after the rewrite and this big update, will suggestions not be gridded into cheddar cheese?
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:11:48 Can it fly forward? If not, strap conveyor engine.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:14:20 Dang, should have asked if cannons were going to stop being in a "will they won't they" non-deciding limbo.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:15:21 Like,  I know Rickje and everyone tried, but nobody could decide on 18/16/17/15th century cannon or modern.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:16:00 Like, who cares what it looks like! Make it an ambiguous cylinder that, I don't know, shoots firework balls with infinite range or something! That's my opinion.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 18:17:24 Read above, probably included in the Big Update Rickje just mentioned.

creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:42:44 <@456226577798135808> Don't downvote things out of spite, Creations has high standards and expectations in a build. You could post it in <#384021699466756107> if you don't want to legitimately judged.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:45:14 Was about to upvote out of slight pity and the fact that it wasn't as bad as the outside until I saw you self-upvoted.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:53:13 Why can't you guys be like Bob and chill? He made a really cool boat nobody is talking about.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:56:44 Come on <@!587393222855229457> , he dropped it I believe, so you should aswell. Anyways, the structure of the inflatable is respectable, and it's greatly round.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:58:48 Aight, I'm gonna head out and argue with someone over shredded s|u|g|g|e|s|t|i|o|n|s in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:01:38 <@!658318819248570381> Why not have hidden motors? It'd be super useful- I get it now.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:03:04 If it's hidden, that would mean people could make- Wait, cameras are invisible aswell, and have a hitbox.
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:03:42 LISTEN HERE OG, STOP MAKING ME RECONSIDER MY OPINION MULTIPLE TIMES!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:04:32 You made me against hidden motors because the thought of invisible blocks with collision scared me a bit, but cameras do have collision AND are invisible!
plane-crazy 2020-11-30 19:06:00 It'd be really useful to make motors go invisible, especially when motorlocking stuff like wings.

general 2020-12-01 13:26:56 ~~conveyor drives, hover engines, or magnet engines~~ magic!!!
general 2020-12-01 13:28:54 Magnet engines are laggy and too slow compared to hover engines and conveyor drives, the other two are more viable.
the-dump 2020-12-01 13:34:14 Wait, 10 hearts in Minecraft damage or 10 HP in Roblox?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:37:37 Hover engines give very stable and steady flight, but I like conveyor drives more for their speed.
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:40:19 Conveyor drives are best used as a kind of slipspace/hyperdrive, and only be used in short jumps, while hover engines provide stable and a bit slower flight.
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:46:49 You mean that lazor trick with the suspensions and super rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:49:50 Go check out that video again, they stretch the suspension out to create the lazor.
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:56:25 No! Halo Oliphant!

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 20:32:02 The conventional shredders are relatively slow at only 300 SP, and require contact to harm you.

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 20:38:08 Even then, just switch to a more effective build to take them on until they leave, and then start using it again.
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 20:38:50 Shredders are actually slowly becoming less common, since they get spited and teamed on until they leave.
