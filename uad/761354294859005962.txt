plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:00:10 Im thinking of making a random prop plane but i give the prop “thrust vertoring”
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:00:31 Like a add motor2s to the propellers
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:02:51 Practically yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:03:03 Ima just experiment around with it
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:07:35 Yeah ik abt that
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:15:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:15:20 Its becuase some blocks become heaiver when they become ice
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:15:21 But
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:15:29 They can become lighter when turned into wood
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:15:51 Like trails delta wings 1x1 and control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:16:44 Block is lighter when turned into ice
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:16:54 Only a few blocks are lighter when turned into wood
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:18:15 These are all that are heavier when turned into ice but some or all can be turned into wood to be lighter idk you can try and experiment
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:19:48 More of the less talking abt smth like this<:holup:644606306870886440>  still needs a few things to be fixed n shit and i could use it in a plane

plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:24:47 So what im thinking off is making a pusher plane with a prop that i use motor2s to basically thrust vector <:stuff:908917207986208828>
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:28:21 Nam nam ch is a plane crazy youtuber who makes show cases guides, and cinematics n shit but his planes dont look the best
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 00:30:34 Its like a scale

creations-chat 2022-11-28 05:58:31 I think hes talking abt <@617296008577286144>s yf-23
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:35:37 Should i make the bf-109 or fw-190 tomorrow?
help 2022-11-28 22:10:10 Does it fly fine? Since if it does those things dont have to be perfectly aligned. If its too nose heavy add helium to the nose of to tail heavy add helium back there or make the plane weigh less
help 2022-11-28 22:12:48 And since you say it goes straight up use ballasts and mess with its weigh till you can fly straight and stable
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:39:51 Should i make/work on a bf-109 or fw-190?

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:22:36 Its alot simpler
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:23:13 Just green trails suspension and hover thrusters to detect players
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:23:19 Not very practical tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:28:22 <@696851246325432321>  video proof?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:28:26 Of radar?

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:36:20 Yuh
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:36:58 Only real way a “radar” can work in pc is hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:09 If a player gets near it moves back
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:11 Yuh

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:20:47 Do they have wings?
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:20:54 /wing panel’s on em
general 2023-01-05 02:21:21 I forogt
general 2023-01-05 02:21:26 It was a white name,
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:22:11 Then thats why
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:22:28 Thats why it wobbles
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:22:33 The wing panel
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:23:11 Wing panels at a specific speep cause things to wobble
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:23:20 Less wing panels= more likley to wobble
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:23:29 Thats why some jets wobble at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:23:42 Ping, and not enough wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:24:35 Then the wing panels are the problem
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:24:41 They cause wobble
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:25:02 Try motor locking more wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 02:25:06 So itl not wobble as much

plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:11:42 i have an idea
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:11:49 use a half wedge from wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:11:53 instead
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:11:59 of half wedge 1x2

plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:12:56 im dumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:12:57 mb
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:13:14 theres nothing else you can do rlly
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:13:22 you can lower the motor lock tower where
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:13:28 it only exposes at the bottom
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:13:30 but
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:13:33 i tried

plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:22:32 alr
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:29:57 yeah alot better
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:30:14 now just add the half wedge 1x2 back and go on from there
plane-crazy 2023-04-23 01:54:59 it just has a little but of wear and tear

general 2023-06-13 20:17:07 ym
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:18:31 also because
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:18:45 most good builders stopped playing
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:18:51 take SR for example
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:18:58 he switched to FP
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:19:33 
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:19:35 and these where his builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:06 thats why
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:10 most people stopped playing
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:16 or changed there building style
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:20:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:21:51 its because
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:21:56 due to roblox updates
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:03 and the age of pc
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:26 its hard to build stuff thats good without high ping
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:28 ir lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:30 or lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:51 pc is hardcoded
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:54 and the age of it too
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:22:55 means
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:01 roblox updates mess with pc
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:15 whole point of pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:16 but
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 20:23:24 we have no news of it at all
