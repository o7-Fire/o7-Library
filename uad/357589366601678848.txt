general 2021-04-01 15:27:16 Why does my helicopter turn right or left whenever the top starts spinning?
general 2021-04-01 15:28:55 I just have 1 motor which i put on 50 speed and the other thing on 30.. and whenever i place it down the thing starts turning right or left.. and even with tail blades it doesnâ€™t work
general 2021-04-01 15:29:46 I use the propellor blade
general 2021-04-01 15:29:55 Oh so thats the problem

help 2021-12-01 14:03:29 Why do my motors keep vibrating like crazy when i have a conveyor engine in my plane??
help 2021-12-01 14:04:10 but it's the only option besides spamming rocket engines in a tiny space with motor locking
help 2021-12-01 14:04:16 is there a way to make it stop?
help 2021-12-01 14:04:53 i'll try
help 2021-12-01 14:06:10 doesn't seem to help as i'm using the motor 2's for flaps and control panels.. is there another engine i can use besides conveyor?
help 2021-12-01 14:06:33 XD
help 2021-12-01 14:06:35 fine fine

help 2021-12-01 14:08:10 lmfao
help 2021-12-01 14:11:23 oh i already began stacking super rockets like crazy
bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:30:15 Can somebody help? Everytime i launch and explode my missiles B + V my plane stops responding to every control i got.. i don't have an anchor block because when i press the 2 buttons again my plane continues to not respond
bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:33:08 I found out it's just the V button that makes my plane go crazy and i don't have any motorlock shit that triggers by pressing V
bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:33:58 They're my own missiles
bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:34:20 not the missiles found in the PVP weapons
bug-reports 2022-05-19 14:34:40 oh okay

general 2022-06-26 11:48:11 but i don't really have the need to talk here but when i notice a bug i first need to spam my way to lvl 3?
general 2022-06-26 11:48:58 but why? all i want is just to do a bug report and show some evidence
general 2022-06-26 11:49:22 cuz my plane is disappearing and reappearing continuously and i can't help it
