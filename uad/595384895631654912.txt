help 2021-08-26 03:57:37 Why tf do people hate on tuts. I'm using them to get to know the game better. I learned how to make a motor lock with a plane I built. And that using motors for pitch and roll is very effective. If I never used a tut as a new player I still would be a bad at building. Sometimes you just gotta let it be.  And don't call people out and be toxic to people who use tuts.
creations-chat 2021-08-26 03:58:47 Use alot of different things. It might take a few iterations but eventually you will get something you like.
creations-chat 2021-08-26 04:02:21 Use stuff like different sized wedges, trails toggles off for that little bit of decor.
help 2021-08-26 04:03:57 M8 some people use tuts to learn
help 2021-08-26 04:04:11 Some just copy because why da hell not
creations-chat 2021-08-26 04:05:32 Plane crazy you can build almost anything. Just take a few tries later out side by side and pick the best one.
