plane-crazy 2023-05-09 15:46:36 is their an engine that doesn't slow you down when you reduce the thrust
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 15:47:00 cus i wanna add real breaks like flaps
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 15:49:47 yeah like a real jet

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 16:34:55 plain crazy
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 16:46:18 in wiki
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 17:19:32 yzarc niap
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:42:30 Anyone know an engine that doesn’t slow the plane down as you decrease the thrust?
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:43:28 He is dead
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:44:04 Yeah but to get to fighter jet speeds like 600
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:44:48 Does it work in motor lock?
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:45:18 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:47:27 It slowes down
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:47:32 When you break
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:48:23 I want it to do the opposite
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:48:31 Like so it can land realistically
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:48:35 With flaps
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:49:14 Idk if it will go fast enough
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:49:16 I’ll see
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:50:04 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:50:14 Like real aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:52:15 I can but it wouldn’t be real landing but like that’s the best option
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:55:10 What did I do to you
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:56:13 Like in a real aircraft when you turn off the engine the engine does not just slow you down magically
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:56:36 It stops producing thrust
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:57:24 Yeah but I can make the whole engine fall out if I wanted to lol
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:57:47 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2023-05-09 19:58:34 Probably
