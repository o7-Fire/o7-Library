general 2021-09-10 21:48:20 Well played
general 2021-09-10 21:50:06 Its Luke's feelings of before and after killing Boba Fett
general 2021-09-10 21:52:20 Ok now I found something I can agree with you on
general 2021-09-10 21:55:48 Now I kinda feel bad for being half american
general 2021-09-10 21:59:04 Anybody remember when one side of America was like "lets honking kill ourselves for some fresh land" and created what is known as orgin trail
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 22:00:22 Drive it off, cast it into the fire

creations-chat 2022-03-18 19:14:25 Got any idea how to get rid of this stupid motor lock I tried everything
creations-chat 2022-03-18 19:17:50 the rest is fine its just that one block that i think i found a fix for

creations-chat 2022-03-19 21:57:21 i was in the middle of building the intake and my desktop gave off a "Mr. Stark I don't feel so good." smell <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:18:57 kinda thinking the f-22 types
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:23:29 I fixed the wings, intakes, and minimized as much motor lock I could, as asked. anything else I need to preform?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 01:27:05 Is it the back or the front of the intakes that need fixing and does the wings need fixing in the back or the front as well, just wondering.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 16:23:29 ok also sorry for not responding so quickly i had to get this stupid rash on my body checked
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:10:28 Put the exposed motorlock to rest, anything else needing fixing?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:14:27 Just wondering is there anything else I need to do. ik "putting the exposed motorlock to rest" sounds like a hate crime but what is there left to do?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:18:15 mig-35 edit: wait there's more than 1?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:25:21 ill just turn it into a su-35 flanker because it looks like one<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-03-20 19:34:00 I just su-35 flanker a Mig-35, ready for paint?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:40:44 Fixed the wings, angled the nose, and did something different with the rails on the wings, anything else?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:52:19 Did a tiny bit of tweaking (not visible). Ready for paint?
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:58:18 Oh hey your back I fixed those problems from earlier..
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:17:40 should I lighten the paint <:clueless:942802644043464734> <@!375281006091173890>  it looks good

plane-crazy 2022-05-25 18:23:35 top view to get an idea of the thickness
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 18:50:15 smoothed the top, thickened it a little in the front and extended it by a mere cm

bug-reports 2022-06-02 04:06:00 just to say if your having problems with motor teleportation (regular locked motors, not motor2) were every time you move a motor it teleports back to place and never locks it could be 1: the motor is set to reset 2: an software in the background running on your pc could be causing it (for me with my f-14 it was razer synapse) 3: pc2 isnt out yet. i dont mean for it to fix basewars problem as of now but its something thats bugged my builds that id like to share ideas of how to fix.
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:14:57 OMG DRAGONFIGHFIGFIR CRASH RHEAL !!1!
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 21:17:41 fr dude says not for people to copy his builds and people do it anyways

creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:55:04 its ok if it sucks, that means theres plenty of room for improvement
creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:57:32 looks good i suggest using a picture to refrence from. a blueprint or 3d model maybe will work.
the-dump 2022-07-01 06:03:40 
creations-chat 2022-07-01 06:21:05 things can get better and maybe we will get better players but i think we might have to wait another 2-4 years ( ik my builds suck but i dont plan on improving, i cant get any better)
creations-chat 2022-07-01 06:27:19 all i can say is that as long as we can get and see improvement we can get the server back on track rn most of the server is whitenames but ill get better but remeber plane crazy isnt just a game its like learning to ride a bike or draw hype things, it takes time

plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:18:55 but i didnt know if it looked ok or not
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:19:09 thats why i asked, just saying
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:30:17 kleki
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:30:25 its an online tool
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:30:47 google
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:33:22 a medic one looks good (sorry for jumping in)\
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:34:09 grey is also nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 22:34:34 green then grey??
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:00:54 finished the slope
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:02:25 one question, what livery should i use?
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:02:31 i want it to be american
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:03:28 i was thinking of this one but its kinda too white
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:05:58 should i do that one or the old navy one?
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:06:39 alright
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:13:22 that looks really good, bonus likes for the fact you made it on MOBILE
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:13:27 kinda hard tbh
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:53:37 the livery made it worse <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 23:54:15 i kinda dont like it its looks bad in my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 00:41:49 its better than the old livery
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 00:42:36 why does this server hate 1 wides, what have they done?
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 00:43:11 good idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 00:43:45 dont forget the canopy looks a little short
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 00:43:57 or it could be just me

creations-chat 2022-07-24 20:07:12 not sure if its good or not for upload <@984694509772357662> F-14
creations-chat 2022-07-24 20:11:04 kinda suspected it to be a bit bad, anything i can improve?
creations-chat 2022-07-24 20:16:27 this is bird eye view, right?
creations-chat 2022-07-24 20:24:37 compaired to the blueprint i used it was diffrent (its most likely because i resized the blueprint a bit)
creations-chat 2022-07-24 20:39:30 this is the image but i resized it to fit the photo a bit
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 22:47:10 so when making a roscale build do you resize the image or does that mess it up?
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 22:48:18 so if i was to compare my build to a blueprint do i resize the image or will it lead to it being dog crap
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 22:49:01 alright
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 19:26:55 feedback before paint?
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 19:30:30 i tried to do the 6 rotors and i think i f*ed it up
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 19:32:05 
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 19:32:35 tail is kinda big looking at a photo
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:23:52 sorry
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:24:18 decided just to redo it and make it smaller, how is this before i go
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:26:03 anything i can improve on it?
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:50:15 i just realized the nose looks like a low poly ps1 helicopter am i stupid 💀
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:53:09 he be on de perc
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:18:17 what i think is that there was a test model with 6 but he is right there are 5
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:19:32 or it could be people dont know how to make a blueprint
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:20:58 i dont see it all i see is a line
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:21:24 on a test model maybe
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:24:07 like i said it could have been a test model for one of the two because there ARE more than one variant
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:24:21 
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:24:33 see there are more than one
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:25:03 need more proof?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:25:09 this one has 5
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:25:17 meaning some have 5 some have 6
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:26:32 i think its multi variants because a gmod model has 5 and so does the ones in project reality (i think)
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:29:05 i guess this sums it up as 5 and 6 rotor blade variants of the little bird then
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:29:42 i kinda like 5 a little more than 6 but they are kinda equal
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:30:46 this is just a bunch of pcc users debating about the rotors on an uncooked omlette (including me)
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:31:00 design redo flaws
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:32:19 theres so much about this thats just bone hurting juice
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:33:42 hope your femur gets better : )

creations-chat 2022-10-23 01:29:12 i suggest overall dislike the build it was only a test to see if i can pull off the trick and successfully make it (edit: wanted to just prove it was possible) <@706717603258957864> thx
creations-chat 2022-10-23 01:32:39 although the nose is good i feel like its gonna get over used
creations-chat 2022-10-23 20:53:25 understandable thx for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:48:33 it kinda looks bad in personal opinion
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:52:34 <@761354294859005962> understandable <@530887980814958613> heres an image you can try to use (ik its an f-16)
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:54:38 the tail wing is also a bit small <@530887980814958613>  ok i can see it now
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:02:11 anybody know a good cold war era jet i can try to build (i might end up butchering it anyways)
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:05:59 ill do the sepecat then maybe attach wings to a beetle
creations-chat 2022-10-23 22:08:33 should i do a camo or a regular war paint
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:51:15 mirage 2000 cockpit
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:18:43 people will be people
creations-chat 2022-12-22 00:54:41 is this good for a mirage wing or should i just use regular wing panels?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:02:45 roblox's website doesn't have a Web.Roblox.com on it or is it just the private servers 🤔 (mxrkava i didnt know that thanks for pointing that out)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:27:53 how does it looks so far? (Mirage 2000-5)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:34:30 only reason im using it is because you can see decals through it (might remove it though)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:38:35 ill probably use regular glass when uploading images of it since ik it triggers you guys <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 01:56:12 <@619312093962829849> microwave it

creations-chat 2022-12-22 02:13:23 like this? ( <@1015440661291487252> you need to be level 3 to get image perms)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 02:20:20 i dont see how this fixed the wing tho it just made it more blocky
creations-chat 2022-12-22 02:24:05 i guess dm it to me
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:04:43 trying to do a mi-24D but of course my small monkey brain don't know basic smooth locking functions and messed up the canopy
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:17:50 so just make it thicker and keep the shape or change the shape too?
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:18:41 bro tbh im using pontoons 💀

plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:21:36 this looks like the falcon from star wars over complicated
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:23:48 anyways with the canopy just use 2x2 cylinders or widen the entire thing?
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:25:24 overall i think i should just redo it, look how skinny this mf is 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 04:26:56 I'm on you with this one because it do be looking kinda ugly (wth do i mean when i say "kinda" this thing full ugly)

plane-crazy 2023-01-11 21:58:34 they don't ban the player they ban the discord user, you would have to report the user to roblox but like they are gonna take action anyways <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:13:56 correct
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:14:32 they watch Ruben Sim so much his twitter became the moderation system
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:16:37 he got an entire belly t-shirt clothing group shut down, and if a regular player was to report they just look at it and continue on by there day
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 22:17:37 minecraft's chat filter is a better moderation system than roblox's

creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:20:17 could sending the springs to heaven fix it, or im just screwed cause i dont use private servers most of the time (edit: i had the idea to magnet push them to the dead zone under the map)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:23:50 its as shrimple as having no life<:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:27:35 simple, just push the mass amount of springs off with a few magnets, send them to the dead zone to despawn under the map (reason not to send them into the sky is because it only makes it worse)
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:33:55 although that was a random ping it doesnt bother me that much, understandable that it was a mistake
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 04:34:44 for god sake put the engines under the wings

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 16:54:13 they tried to simulate stuffing falling out of a stuffed toy but now that you say that it seems weird now

plane-crazy 2023-07-11 14:26:41 you either get F22 or B2 out of a 12 yo aviation freak and that question of "whats the first stealth jet you can think of" you can immediately tell if they a child or not
