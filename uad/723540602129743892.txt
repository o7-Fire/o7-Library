general 2022-08-22 10:08:19 Verification is hard when you're an idiot like me, ngl
general 2022-08-22 10:09:13 yeah ikr
general 2022-08-22 10:09:34 I had to do it 3 times before realising the numbers tagged
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 11:42:33 damn
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 11:45:05 I'm working on a plane that has a clusterbomb cartridge as it's main body
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:02:17 bro I tried taking some photo's of my F-15 and an old spitfire photobommed me :') direct hit on the cocpit with a motorlock clusterbomb

plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:03:07 Tactical warcrimes engaged
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:30:27 yeah XD
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:02:47 Bro I miss the lobby's where people compliment your builds..
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:39:58 I think I made a decent vtol.. just on an F-15 XD
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:49:43 Yeah so my version is different because.. it has 2 thrusters that work separately from the main engines..
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:49:52 So I have everything keybinded
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:50:17 And if I press the wrong button I will flip upside down and shoot down to the ground
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:51:25 But do you have 11 keybinds just for takeoff? <:ElonWoke:589674854798589962>
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:52:03 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:52:17 Well with the extra vtol it makes 16
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:53:43 WHY NOT
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:54:39 I also made a version that has propellors
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:54:44 Fight me.
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:54:53 Or fear me.
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:55:40 But that aint a F-15 with propellors just slapped on the wings and the front
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:55:48 Which looks worse-
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:56:24 This looks quite good if I am totally honest
