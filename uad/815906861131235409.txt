plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:18:19 In general it’s fine but wings ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:24:12 I think splotfy has a point, a good pvp fighter should have as less motorlock as you can, since it reduces lag. For example, I don’t have a good pc, so I can’t make a big build with much motor lock, the max amount of block I could use for a not so laggy plane is 300 and for a tank 230
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:25:15 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:07:30 That’s actually a good idea to build
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:08:03 It’s epic, I may build later today lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:08:20 Thanks man
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 14:25:45 That’s actually a pretty interesting method, considering the size of that build
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:22:00 Hm ok, not like I asked for feedback but thanks
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:25:19 lol, I mean, he's actually right; the back one is actually motorlocked, same with red star, front one is actual motor 2. Yet, there's exposed motorlock so meh
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:28:15 Sure, as if motor 2 could lock, surely red star has a motor 2 behind it, anyways, not my problem.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:30:17 AFV stands for Armoured Fighting Vehicle
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:34:50 My man should stop adding up excuses and just accept it. Even if it wasn't an excuse, you should accept that your builds do have exposed lock, as I did with mines, is not that hard.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:39:50 He's got a point.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:45:20 I didn't really asked for feedback, nor for your opinion, (not trying to be rude either) yet you answered to what I said, so basically we can say you started the argument and instead of giving facts, you have showed the weakness of your argument (if that's how we can call it)  by adding up excuses.

Not gonna continue this argument anymore, good night everyone.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:00:39 yes lol, I'm glad you guys liked it

creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:35:53 Well it's not poontons, it's actually 2 half cylinders-2 motorlocked to be on the center with half ball motorlocked on sides to make it looks softer and more near to the design.

By the way, thanks everyone a lot, I had never been so near to 100 upvotes and even less taking on mind that it was on such a short time. 
Thanks.

the-dump 2021-09-20 00:42:32 agreed
creations-chat 2021-09-20 16:59:34 Can I get some feedback on this? It’s just a comparison with an image to see how near it is, but i don’t know how to make the barrel, could someone help me?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:05:41 Sure (The tank is the HWK 30 Águila, on case you searching for images of it)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:07:56 Here's from another angle
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:13:53 Well that’s going to be covered, not done yet, but by now, it has no exposed lock
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:21:11 So, anyone can help me on barrel? I still don’t know how to make it
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:50:40 Well this already uses that (0.5 cylinder together with disconnector and gun to make the other details), but I mean like, the front of barrel, that little hole on the last part of barrel (plus im trying to avoid exposed lock)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:35:59 Lol, it’s my dear friend mr skill issue, what a nice moment to see you, how have you been mr i think I do best builds in game? (Btw I’m just joking, not trying to get you mad, but if you do, then that’s your problem)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:59:13 Guys chill, he’s not even being disrespectful
creations-chat 2021-09-21 19:21:38 Use more wedges, make the tail a bit wider and taller, add variation of colors, try remaking nose on a less round way and make it more like a spear shaped wedge, try also coloring the glass with a different color from the body and finally try adding turrets instead of just fixed guns.
(Hope this helps to improve it)
creations-chat 2021-09-21 19:43:32 Lol they were doing that?
creations-chat 2021-09-22 02:56:14 Im not :/
(But most admit most are lol)
Well I mean, I didn’t even plan to get expert role, I was just trying to post a build and see what people think about it, then a friend told me I could get the expert rank since it got over 200 upvotes on less than 12 hours
creations-chat 2021-09-22 02:59:49 Anyways, even tho no one asked, I go sleep, good night everyone

creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:31:56 Jeez that was quite a bit too much, the poor guy is probably new to the game and was just trying to share his work, I think I regret my offer on a collab picture related to tanks
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:37:57 Fairly good point but, even if we assume that he’s not new, you could’ve just told him or explained what he could improve rather than calling his hull bad, for example, you could tell him to use sparklers or motorlocked guns for the barrel on turrets, or to make a less blocky hull
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:40:11 Agreed, welp I’m glad that you preferred taking rather than fighting, that’s pretty respectable
creations-chat 2021-10-31 20:09:45 who is krm games and why he downvoting every build; but mine isn't a repost, it's an old build that i never posted, the only thing i posted was the 7th version, the one i posted recently is the 8th version of the same tank
creations-chat 2021-10-31 20:15:59 ok, i was just asking

bot-central 2022-06-26 00:05:07 How to change rank color I forgot
creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:52:54 You could try replacing the first 2 blocks from each side of the leg that connect the wheel with a suspension, although I'm unsure if that would work
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:43:18 Maybe make It so theres cooldown, certain Time in game needed plus the person you trade with has to be on your friend list, both have to accept and maybe add an option so the build can be removed in case of scam or something, this would also need to make It so said build can only be saved on that slot, and not moved to another one, preventing It from being stolen, but idk, thats just a suggestion
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:46:00 Sounds like a really safe way of trading, yeah

plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:39:49 Wdym? Russia ain't communist ._.
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:41:48 Just a fraction of their people, not all
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:42:06 Tho I believe they see it as a sort of uh
symbol, rather than a political ideology
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:42:13 Like a reminder of their past
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:42:57 I used to be interested on that lol
Then I actually started investigating on my own and developed my own criteria and ideas
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:43:29 That's what I wish to avoid
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 17:43:54 Thing is, I like some stuff from let's say communism, but also stuff from capitalism, and so on
