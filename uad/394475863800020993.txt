general 2021-06-01 15:05:53 No company wants too because they’ll be harassed for doing so
general 2021-06-01 15:06:49 And then they do will be seen as shills who only do it for publicity
general 2021-06-01 15:07:38 I personally don’t care either way people who make big deals about logos are losers
general 2021-06-01 15:08:22 Because that 5% of the population is mistreated and depressed
