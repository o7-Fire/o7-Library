plane-crazy 2021-07-28 17:35:11 How do you make a powerful railgun
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 17:35:17 Made one but the cutter seem to not
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 17:35:20 Do the job
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 17:35:47 Tried TNT and obliterated a poor Me262 with it but it is unreliable at higher power settings and end up destroying the whole gun

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:37:47 I'm still trying to make a railgun work properly
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:38:03 It worked once and an Me262 is blown to pieces
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:38:11 My problem is the projectile not killing
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:38:18 Not the railgun itself
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:38:58 Can only fit like 1 cutter
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:39:23 Doesn't work
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:39:30 It doesn't kill properly
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:39:49 Mostly it just ricochet entirely
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:43:11 Looks shit even for my low non motorlock standard
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:43:26 Control surface spammed wing is ugly
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:44:03 Lol one time my railgun penetrated a mustang and stuck there
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:45:27 this is the ammo <@!274948758595436544>
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:45:57 even without it it doesn't
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:46:06 better than ball ammo
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:46:52 i tried cutter but at higher power it just can't hit
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:46:55 directly
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:47:34 see that trail
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:47:35 
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:47:39 it doesn't go straight
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:47:40 it spins
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:48:15 i'm on pvp tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 06:48:54 oh yeah my join open
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:40:11 Seems like my railgun problem is unsolvable
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:40:20 Caused by the game itself not properly registering hits
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:42:58 Add ejection system
You can't kill him but you can still make him mad <:Troll3d:864969437474979871>
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:44:03 My Su47 and Su33 both got trollery ejection system
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:44:15 He mad
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:44:18 When i eject
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 07:46:02 Looks vs functionality
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:52:49 plane crazy moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:52:54 made an exact copy of my VTOL plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:52:57 and SOMEHOW
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:53:02 the copy doesn't fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:53:12 it's the same block by block
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:53:14 and material
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:53:29 exact copy everything
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:54:40 for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:54:45 the copy is too heavy at the front
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:10:33 yeahhh for whatever reason the copy has different properties despite being the exact same block by block
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:10:53 the original one can't hover without the back thruster at 90%
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:11:03 the copy can fly with just the main two wing engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:11:14 the original can go to horizontal flight and the copy can't
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:11:17 plane crazy logic
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:12:07 guess it's never gonna be solved

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:20:56 those bullshit abstract stuff usually
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:21:01 is what people refer to as modern art
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:21:34 like these
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:21:46 look like what a 5yr old would draw innit
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:22:45 if someone that starts ww2 got something right

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:56:40 i drew my custom jet first but my plane crazy build doesn't live up to expectations
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:57:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:57:34 changed it up bit because original design too difficult without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:58:15 middle engine is your regular engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:58:21 the side ones are basically
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:58:24 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 08:58:43 the design is combining GTA's Starling and Pyro

plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:43:44 tried making this but after some time it simply slips due to too much required torque input
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:43:44 hi
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:44:17 making angles are pain
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:45:42 hate anything involving motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:45:53 takes longer to figure out the motorlock than the mechanism itself
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 13:47:00 just need a way to make insane RPMs
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:53:37 can anyone explain how this guy make a rotating part that goes through a block
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:53:44 when i tryna to motorlock one it just goes stuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:54:33 those doesn't seem like text blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:54:43 hi
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:55:33 you need normal blocks to attach text blocks to
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:55:51 and text blocks can't be attached from the side only from the back
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:56:07 the blocks still have collision
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:56:38 the one in video
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:56:41 looks like a solid block
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:57:06 explain this one
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:57:40 those doesn't look like text blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:58:06 text blocks have collision off
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:58:12 but they don't make normal blocks have collision off

general 2021-10-31 04:41:13 But they do no damage because they're soo fast

plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:10:01 "old binary code"
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:10:07 This is some rambling shit
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:10:39 There is no programming language that uses binary directly
Binary is literally the base of all computer on earth
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:10:51 There can't be old binary code
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:12:20 I don't know how to explain it
But if you know just a little bit of computer science that sentence means horseshit
general 2021-10-31 05:12:46 Just annoy them
general 2021-10-31 05:12:50 By using super fast jets
general 2021-10-31 05:13:19 My jet has like ummm 30 super rocket engine
general 2021-10-31 05:13:30 But it's made of dianond plate
general 2021-10-31 05:13:31 Diamond
general 2021-10-31 05:13:35 Soo it's needed
general 2021-10-31 05:13:45 Or else it won't fly
general 2021-10-31 05:29:48 Any display can see the line
general 2021-10-31 05:29:56 Unless you're on low res potato
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 05:52:58 Don't overthink it
It's just the OP using bollocks terms
general 2021-10-31 05:59:25 Imagine steam version of plane crazy
general 2021-10-31 05:59:55 Hmm actually that would be simpleplanes <a:kekw:812903264742801439>
general 2021-10-31 06:00:05 Simple plane not multiplayer tho
general 2021-10-31 06:00:09 U can't murk people
general 2021-10-31 06:00:23 Iirc paid
general 2021-10-31 06:00:49 With the existence of simplerockets 2
general 2021-10-31 06:00:55 Simpleplane is pretty much obsolete
general 2021-10-31 06:02:14 There must be something else they're doing than just fixing overloaded server
general 2021-10-31 06:02:37 They probably think
Hmmm instead of just fixing it let's update it also
general 2021-10-31 06:02:47 I'm hoping for less lag after this
general 2021-10-31 06:03:14 Those are not server related
general 2021-10-31 06:03:44 And i kinda like copy paste shirts
I ain't paying 95 robux for something that gets deleted later
general 2021-10-31 06:04:01 I bought a shirt from the original creator only for it to get deleted
Fuck that
I'm going to the pirates

general 2021-10-31 16:20:55 ever seen a download that takes 4 months?
general 2021-10-31 16:21:56 just download speed not ramping up on steam
general 2021-10-31 16:21:58 
general 2021-10-31 16:22:42 i'm gonna try restarting my router, because speedtest is also showing low speed
general 2021-10-31 16:23:15 i never set any bs like that
general 2021-10-31 16:23:28 speedtest only shows 5Mbps from the supposed 30
general 2021-10-31 16:23:32 so its definitely the internet
general 2021-10-31 16:23:49 even then what kind of throttle sets it to bits per second
general 2021-10-31 16:24:19 ***and roblox still dead***
general 2021-10-31 16:24:47 it's 5 here

general 2021-10-31 16:50:07 That's what they say
general 2021-10-31 16:50:13 Watch as roblox stay down for another day
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:56:38 tutorial missile users are annoying as hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:57:30 i can't use any remotely big build
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:57:41 without them being ooga booga big thingy kill
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:58:04 and i think they're not the regular missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:58:15 they're faster than my 600 sps jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:58:31 conveyor makes it weird as hell
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:58:47 i don't use any fucky wucky engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:58:51 just rockets
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:59:02 more natural
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 01:59:21 using ice will absolutely destroy the aesthetic kek
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:00:05 and isn't lighter material
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:00:07 easier to kill
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:01:08 nah
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:01:10 top speed stays
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:01:18 using ice only messes with the aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:01:24 making it got toooo much lift
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:02:15 people with uglyass build whose sole purpose is to sweat in plane crazy pvp <:CRING:738266433510834206>
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:03:15 public
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:04:10 i really don't mind my speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:04:17 i just need something that can make control
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:04:18 easier
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:05:07 look at this cring boi
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:05:25 his shredder disappointed their parents
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:06:59 pvp still as laggy as usual
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 02:07:09 guess my ODP still won't work due to explosion delay smh

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:21:46 a horrible attempt
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:21:48 
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:21:49 at this
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:24:20 my builds are very old schooled 2018 style
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:24:34 Oversized no motorlock build
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:26:55 tried making CFA myself
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:27:09 but its very difficult without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:27:24 because of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:27:39 i abandoned the project
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:29:06 scan
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:29:08 
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:30:21 i usually just build my stuff barebone
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:30:26 just enough for it to work
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:31:00 don't really care if it looks shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:31:18 Plane can catch chickenpox?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:31:53 the left one is obviously a hornet
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:32:28 sometimes no motorlock is better than with
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:33:07 i'm hoping PC2 would have a proper damage mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:33:27 i want my kinetic weapons
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:33:28 to work
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:33:55 basic one...
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:33:57 rebind guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:35:02 Grav slider is such godsend
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:36:17 auto track motor  is guided missile
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:53:41 Plane crazy dogfights are just boring...
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:53:45 they take sooooo
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:53:47 fucking long
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 17:54:03 and you need to rely a lot on luck and rocket hitting
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 05:03:56 Wish there's a share build feature tbh
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 05:04:54 That's cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 05:05:42 I also remember there being a script roaming around people use where you can save build into an actual file
But of course it's exploit stuff so can't be used.

plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:57:21 there seem to be an odd property when you surround a block all with hover thruster
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:57:23 it enters stasis
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:59:05 its default
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 13:59:58 i was trying to make a stasis chamber by putting a block inside a chamber where the walls have hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:00:13 doesnt work for some reason, thought hover thruster supposed to also affect blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:00:19 then i tried putting it on the block
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:04:54 how about a half ball
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:04:56 half as in
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:04:59 half in size
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:05:04 not cut in half
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:05:35 
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:07:09 how about making the spawn area bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:08:53 Gears would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:09:15 i always want to know how a 1:GOOGOL gear ratio is like
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:09:23 doesnt work after certain gear ratio
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:09:32 torque requirement exceed friction
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:10:47 kinetic damage would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:10:55 my orbital weapon would finally works
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:11:53 my orbital cannon uses explosive ball powered by a whole lotta magnet
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:12:18 guns sometimes bug out
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:12:27 it appears destroyed in your screen
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:12:35 you end up with someone flying a "ghost" vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:12:45 because their vehicle isnt damaged on their screen
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:14:15 guns are too slow for ships
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:14:23 i prefer tnts
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:14:28 instant cut in half
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:14:44 depth charges from my submarine
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:15:29 i'm more on halo orbital weapon ones
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:15:54 made the mini moncton with auto loader
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:16:10 so much power it lags your game everytime it shoots
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:16:31 but does nothing when the projectile actually hits the target
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:16:38 the explosion delay is massive
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:17:38 planes better of using firework
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:17:52 magnets on planes are also disaster
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:19:38 we need a piston thats open by default
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:19:51 then we can pull it in after spawning
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:23:06 can it explode
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:23:27 its motorlock right
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:23:36 i mean obviously
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:23:43 and motorlock have the tendency to
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:23:50 explode under motorlock-god
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:32:14 seems like plane crazy physics is good enough to simulate an atom
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:32:16 
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:33:18 it also simulates fluid dynamics at this level of balls
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:33:32 object with less density will float on the ball
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:33:43 yes balls
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:34:33 no one here
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:34:40 will want you to have a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:37:26 LMAO
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:37:30 IT ALSO HAS ORBITAL MECHANICS
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:37:39 one tiny ball orbit the big collection balls
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:38:09 i should move on a pribate server
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:38:22 roblox servers arent exactly for simulating an atom
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:46:23 how about a little gravitational simulation
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:48:12 i wonder if it will simulate an impact
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 14:48:16 i will need a second person for that
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:33:27 playing with the balls in plane crazy is addictive
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:33:34 the fact that they act like a fluid
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:33:55 hey hey
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:34:00 i'm talking about **particles**
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:34:05 yes particles
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 15:37:44 Issue is freedom of speech
And letting the government decide what's misinformation and what's not can be.... Catastrophic
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 17:45:09 seems like plane crazy simulated a fireball
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 17:45:32 that is going up btw
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 17:45:40 now raining down
general 2022-03-22 17:54:48 well audios are finally gone 
speakers now useless
general 2022-03-22 17:55:00 no more cool sound effects
general 2022-03-22 18:19:23 -Green RAM check
-Messy verge style thermal paste check
-Zero static protection check
general 2022-03-22 18:19:37 yep checks all the boxes for a god pc
general 2022-03-22 18:20:18 i bet they also got those "thermal paste applicator"
general 2022-03-22 18:21:19 best way to put a thermal paste is letting the cooler do the work
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 10:57:32 so uhh

plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:06:47 i can get like 10 kills in DCS in the meantime
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:07:59 i'm old fashioned and still use high performant non motorlocked big Su-30
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:08:11 well no motorlock is rather misleading, i use those for engines
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:08:20 as my plane is made of diamond block
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 18:08:49 it can turn as well as those pvp planes just aiming is almost impossible with keyboard
