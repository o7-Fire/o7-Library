creations-chat 2021-10-26 16:45:21 That one
creations-chat 2021-10-26 16:48:06 Yes but why do that when I can position the blade further back, that way I won't need any fold what so ever

creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:28:15 What bugs me is that if someone posts something incredible there in pcc there will always be a lob headed yabo giving themselves the go to downvote it

contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:32:16 3 variants
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:32:25 One for ground attack which was the IDS
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:32:36 Another for electronics warfare

contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:33:23 Which is what I am making
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:34:01 Like the F-15 Strike eagle
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:36:00 It's main intend is ground strike
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:36:07 With some air to air capabilities
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:36:13 But only for defense
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:36:44 No
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:36:53 The strike eagle has no air to air kills
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:37:03 Apart from one scored using a guided bomb
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:40:00 But it's main mission is ground attack
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:41:41 It's a multirole strike fighter
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:42:01 It is still more of a strike aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-13 16:42:21 Ok that's that I guess
