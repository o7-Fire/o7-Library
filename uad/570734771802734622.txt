plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:14:02 how to say you have a good pc without saying you have a good pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:15:11 but you say its pvpable, meaning you can play on decent graphics, and have 600+ speed with no wobble
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:15:16 at the very least
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:15:19 thats impossible for me ;(
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:15:34 ah okie
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:15:36 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 01:16:33 lmao
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:04:17 OKAY CAN WE FIX THE GODDAMN BUG WITH MOTOR 2 SERVO SET TO 180Â° MAX ANGLE NOT ROTATING THE RIGHT WAY? IT WILL WORK HALF THE TIME AND THEN DECIDES TO ROTATE THE OPPOSITE WAY DESPITE NOT HAVING CHANGED THE SETTINGS
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:05:17 this has been reported multiple times in the past and nothing has been done about it
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:52 if this isnt fixed in like a week
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:55 imma ping someone
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:19:56 idk who
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:20:00 but someone
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:31 what do you want me to read?
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:37 that they're developing pc2?
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:38 ik that
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:45 but this is such a minor yet annoying glitch
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:39:51 i feel like it should have been fixed by now
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:21 obviously i cant
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:26 im not on the dev team
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:34 btw just link me the post you want me to see ffs
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:41:55 im not gonna scroll through half of all the messages to see one post
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:11 ah
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:12 i see
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:22 but i mean
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:34 the reason i feel like this is a super simple bug
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:44 is cuz it just doesn't follow the rules given by the config
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:43:50 which is the direction of rotation
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:11 basically, just go in, check where the loophole is with 180Â°, and badabing badaboom
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:25 :/
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:36 oh it has nothing to do with collision
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:40 its direction of rotation
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:55 at 180Â°, it for some reason gets confused
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:44:58 thats all
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:55:27 servo
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:02 make a motor 2 servo
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:04 set to toggle
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:10 make 180Â°
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:35 at the very least
bug-reports 2021-09-27 03:56:41 it flips the forward/backward
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:52:13 True
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:56:52 This prob isnât how they have it coded but
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:16 if (direction) = {forward}
  then rotate{clockwise}
if (maxvalue) = 180
 then rotate{180}
end
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:39 Iâm not an expert in lua or anything, but I imagine a fix would be as simple as that
bug-reports 2021-09-27 04:58:43 Or something similar idk
bug-reports 2021-09-27 05:16:34 anyway, moral of the story, if you've been dealing with things not working in plane crazy for an entire day, dont post anything
bug-reports 2021-09-27 05:16:42 or else you end up ranting and making a fool of yourself
bug-reports 2021-09-27 15:10:34 Itâs for things that open, like a bomb hatch or whatever
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:01 Mate chill
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:11 Discussionâs over
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:25 Itâs simply a fact that the bug happens sometimes
bug-reports 2021-09-27 23:52:46 I prob shouldnât have ranted like I did
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 00:25:01 how can i hide these motors?https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833861220279779349/892205031938486282/unknown.png

general 2021-09-29 03:28:00 e
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:28:25 s y m m e t r y
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:29:03 also it makes it so i dont have cameras in the actual cockpit itself if i connect 1 then go in between
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:29:08 so i connect both from the outside
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:29:15 <@!707133341454958604>
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:36:48 very naisu
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:37:10 i really hope so
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:37:29 theres pretty much no point to having regular pilot seats if they cant be used by friends
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:37:40 and make it so it controls whatever it's attached to
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:37:48 oh wait that could be pretty complex code damn
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:38:10 u mean the grills over the glass or whatever it is right>
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:38:23 cuz i dont see any reason to make them shorter
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:38:30 it covers the distance nicely imo
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:38:54 oh ik what to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:39:11 hide a motor lock in there that moves it slightly to the side, and get rid of 1 row
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:39:16 this makes it so they dont go farther out
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:39:17 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:40:48 like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:40:52 dots would be cameras or smth idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 03:41:26 just an idea

creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:06:05 right, but it's a custom, so he doesn't have to be *exactly* accurate. I mean, like, if you want to, go ahead, but its just a bit unnecessary.
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:08:07 i'm not saying he can't, just that if it's way too difficult he doesn't *have* to, ya know?
creations-chat 2021-10-08 02:10:09 i wish we could get regular motors with max angles, would make angle locking so much easier <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>

general 2021-11-07 04:56:32 dont drink if underage
general 2021-11-07 04:56:46 cuz in russia, for example, there are 12 yr olds drinking vodka

general 2021-11-07 04:57:10 yup
general 2021-11-07 04:57:24 the worst i've seen
general 2021-11-07 04:57:27 is like
general 2021-11-07 04:57:44 a student in junior high
general 2021-11-07 04:57:45 like
general 2021-11-07 04:57:49 13ish

general 2021-11-07 04:58:09 yeah
general 2021-11-07 04:58:10 not good
general 2021-11-07 04:58:12 but like

general 2021-11-07 04:58:31 oh my
general 2021-11-07 04:59:11 i wish america was less free
general 2021-11-07 04:59:23 the problem with america
general 2021-11-07 04:59:30 is people refuse to put aside their civil liberties
general 2021-11-07 04:59:36 even if it impedes on others
general 2021-11-07 04:59:49 getting a little political here, even though it technically shouldn
general 2021-11-07 05:00:05 vaccination and covid was politicized here in the us
general 2021-11-07 05:00:08 which is ridiculous

general 2021-11-07 05:00:59 anti-vax/anti-maskers fall into one political demographic
general 2021-11-07 05:01:14 while vaccinated ppl/ppl who wear masks are in a second demographic
general 2021-11-07 05:01:22 yeah
general 2021-11-07 05:01:43 no
general 2021-11-07 05:02:11 that's good
general 2021-11-07 05:02:14 problem is
general 2021-11-07 05:02:21 here in the us, compared to france
general 2021-11-07 05:02:26 ppl here are much more selfish
general 2021-11-07 05:02:32 than in france
general 2021-11-07 05:02:35 controversial, but true

general 2021-11-07 05:06:04 do you have to be
general 2021-11-07 05:06:13 yeah tru
general 2021-11-07 05:06:26 ah well
general 2021-11-07 05:07:04 see i'd actually disagree here
general 2021-11-07 05:07:10 bc especially if you work in like
general 2021-11-07 05:07:15 a hospital, or public service
general 2021-11-07 05:07:20 where u come in contact with tons of ppl
general 2021-11-07 05:07:32 ehhhh
general 2021-11-07 05:07:34 i mean
general 2021-11-07 05:07:57 i mean so
general 2021-11-07 05:08:00 there are cases
general 2021-11-07 05:08:04 where ppl can't be cuz of like
general 2021-11-07 05:08:09 auto-immune problems?
general 2021-11-07 05:08:14 but otherwise, ppl should be
general 2021-11-07 05:08:17 idk that's my take on it
general 2021-11-07 05:09:38 blocky nose
general 2021-11-07 05:09:40 use like
general 2021-11-07 05:09:43 a cutter on the very front

general 2021-11-07 05:10:02 yours doesn't
general 2021-11-07 05:10:11 cutter is one block
general 2021-11-07 05:10:35 ok then
general 2021-11-07 05:10:48 n i c e
general 2021-11-07 05:11:14 ah
general 2021-11-07 05:11:17 rip then
general 2021-11-07 05:11:35 ironic
general 2021-11-07 05:12:22 oh that's fascinating
general 2021-11-07 05:13:30 in the us, some places require proof of vaccination to enter
general 2021-11-07 05:13:46 i feel like, unless you really can't, you should be required to be vaccinated
general 2021-11-07 05:13:49 that's my take on it
general 2021-11-07 05:13:53 ah ok
general 2021-11-07 05:14:22 but ye, unless you can't due to actual health reasons, you should be vaccinated, bc it protects you and everyone else around you, including those who can't get vaccinated
general 2021-11-07 05:14:33 i think we have something similar
general 2021-11-07 05:14:42 pretty sure its a digital proof
general 2021-11-07 05:14:59 thats cool
general 2021-11-07 05:15:43 i wish we had healthcare like you guys do <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-11-07 05:16:01 i'd rather pay taxes than pay a ridiculous amount for insurance
general 2021-11-07 05:16:05 that doesn't cover me half the year

general 2021-11-07 23:47:36 is there any way to get the sides of text blocks to stick to other blocks?
general 2021-11-07 23:47:50 im just hoping theres a way i dont know
general 2021-11-07 23:48:01 although i assume not

general 2021-12-01 01:28:19 Dry aged prime rib i made
general 2021-12-01 01:28:29 ye
general 2021-12-01 01:28:39 no
general 2021-12-01 01:28:58 it's medium rare you neanderthals
general 2021-12-01 01:29:08 ??
general 2021-12-01 01:29:39 ah, if you mean what's on top, it's a mustard, thyme, garlic, and rosemary rub
general 2021-12-01 01:29:47 also that's just the cut of meat i got
general 2021-12-01 01:29:48 srry
general 2021-12-01 01:29:50 lmfao
general 2021-12-01 01:30:08 a prime rib is a rib-eye roast
general 2021-12-01 01:30:40 btw, that fat is deeply flavored with dry age, so it was actually extremely enjoyable to eat with the meat
general 2021-12-01 01:31:18 okay so
general 2021-12-01 01:31:23 some of you are gonna freak out at this lmfao
general 2021-12-01 01:31:37 so this is what dry age looks like
general 2021-12-01 01:31:57 dont worry lmao
general 2021-12-01 01:31:58 i trimmed most
general 2021-12-01 01:32:12 this is the inside tho
general 2021-12-01 01:32:16 you trim off the outer bark
general 2021-12-01 01:32:35 yeah, that wasn't cooked dipshit
general 2021-12-01 01:32:42 58 kilos
general 2021-12-01 01:32:54 lmao
general 2021-12-01 01:33:15 btw the reason i keep the outer fat on during the dry aging is it minimizes waste
general 2021-12-01 01:33:43 you have to remove the outer bark, and if you remove fat, it's less wasteful than the meat itself
general 2021-12-01 01:33:48 how old are you

"AR-15 style rifles have been used in a number of the deadliest mass shooting incidents, and have come to be widely characterized as the weapon of choice for perpetrators of mass shootings"
"Between Jan 1 and May 18, 2018, 31 students and teachers were killed inside U.S. schools. That exceeds the number of U.S. military servicemembers who died in combat and noncombat roles during the same period."

general 2022-01-19 01:19:58 nah it's https and it's an actual website
general 2022-01-19 01:20:24 anyway, the reason it's higher in earlier categories is that most games aren't fully optimized for higher core/thread counts
general 2022-01-19 01:21:07 it was benchmarked up to 8 cores, but past that i would have lost, seeing as the intel cpu has 10 cores and the 5900x has twice what it was benchmarked to, at 16 cores
the-dump 2022-01-19 01:21:44 refer to what i just wrote

general 2022-01-19 01:29:19 aight yeah that's what i thought

creations-chat 2022-04-27 04:07:24 ??? again, white name moment. Not only would that give the interior no reason to exist, it would still stick out
creations-chat 2022-04-27 04:09:26 i literally have a radar and stick inside of it ð you're obviously new to this, you very much can have an interior in a 1-block wide build
creations-chat 2022-04-27 04:11:47 bro that landing gear <:KEKW:670310537300672528> also no angled intakes, the landing gear on the sides wouldn't go in anywhere, it would simply rest under the wings. your vertical stabilizers have a noticeable gap between them and the fuselage, and that's not a 1-block wide build if you were tryna say that, it's a 2-block wide build (for the cockpit i mean) OH also no canopy details

general 2022-05-17 06:05:55 yes
general 2022-05-17 06:05:59 no
general 2022-05-17 06:06:04 perhaps
general 2022-05-17 06:06:20 but ye main reason is uh
general 2022-05-17 06:06:30 all discord bans are ip bans
general 2022-05-17 06:06:36 and the server doesn't allow new accounts
general 2022-05-17 06:06:42 so i just need an old one
general 2022-05-17 06:06:49 and then i can do the funny trol
general 2022-05-17 06:07:01 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2022-05-17 06:07:36 any accounts that have shared the ip at any time also get banned from said server
general 2022-05-17 06:07:51 so even an account i haven't touched in months
general 2022-05-17 06:07:56 because i logged onto it on my main pc
general 2022-05-17 06:07:58 is also ban

general 2022-05-19 06:16:36 will pc2 have real lock on missiles?
general 2022-05-19 06:16:38 i hope it does
general 2022-05-19 06:16:49 prob not but
general 2022-05-19 06:16:52 i can wish
general 2022-05-19 06:17:13 nah
general 2022-05-19 06:17:15 i mean like
general 2022-05-19 06:17:17 lock on
general 2022-05-19 06:17:18 fire
general 2022-05-19 06:17:21 and go away
general 2022-05-19 06:17:29 i just want pc2 to have good combat :(
general 2022-05-19 06:17:48 no, basically a version of the rocket
general 2022-05-19 06:17:54 so u cant make auto tracking builds
general 2022-05-19 06:18:04 okay so
general 2022-05-19 06:18:10 u know the rocket/missile in game right now?
general 2022-05-19 06:18:15 add a radar system
general 2022-05-19 06:18:26 that locks on people's builds (not avatar)
general 2022-05-19 06:18:31 hmm
general 2022-05-19 06:18:35 tracker cone like war thunder?
general 2022-05-19 06:18:39 flares
general 2022-05-19 06:18:50 ye ye
general 2022-05-19 06:19:00 and maybe add like
general 2022-05-19 06:19:03 a flare block
general 2022-05-19 06:19:16 that when released
general 2022-05-19 06:19:19 if close enough to missile
general 2022-05-19 06:19:23 overrides center mass
general 2022-05-19 06:19:26 and missile goes for flare
general 2022-05-19 06:19:32 y not?
general 2022-05-19 06:19:44 i bet you it's not that hard to code
general 2022-05-19 06:20:01 basically, make a cone with a range
general 2022-05-19 06:20:15 emanating from where the player body is facing
general 2022-05-19 06:20:38 okay so, basis to code a lock on system
general 2022-05-19 06:20:50 make a conic shape
general 2022-05-19 06:21:01 gun
general 2022-05-19 06:21:04 so no click
general 2022-05-19 06:21:14 okay listen
general 2022-05-19 06:21:21 no, because motor 2 tracks mouse
general 2022-05-19 06:21:37 instead have a code, point at the front of the player, and give it a range
general 2022-05-19 06:21:52 if the center mass of a build enters that cone for 3 seconds
general 2022-05-19 06:22:13 center mass adjusts no?
general 2022-05-19 06:22:21 flare block
general 2022-05-19 06:22:25 it releases flares
general 2022-05-19 06:22:29 no it has to be an actual block
general 2022-05-19 06:22:30 because that way
general 2022-05-19 06:22:34 it can be coded
general 2022-05-19 06:22:43 missile tracks center of build mass
general 2022-05-19 06:23:02 however, if flare is released in a spherical radius close enough to the missile
general 2022-05-19 06:23:15 the missile's tracking is overridden and it hits the flare instead
general 2022-05-19 06:23:17 NO
general 2022-05-19 06:23:20 SHREDDER BUG
general 2022-05-19 06:23:47 okie the in that case
general 2022-05-19 06:23:48 track player
general 2022-05-19 06:24:04 aight fair enough
general 2022-05-19 06:24:18 ð¤¨
general 2022-05-19 06:24:32 NO NO NO
general 2022-05-19 06:24:36 AUTO TRACK SHREDDER
general 2022-05-19 06:24:40 bad idea
general 2022-05-19 06:24:44 big bad idea
general 2022-05-19 06:24:55 plus
general 2022-05-19 06:25:06 fair enough
general 2022-05-19 06:25:27 hmm
general 2022-05-19 06:25:29 you have a point
general 2022-05-19 06:25:42 honestly, main problem with custom missiles
general 2022-05-19 06:25:46 the laggier the server
general 2022-05-19 06:25:48 the more wobbly they get
general 2022-05-19 06:26:04 oh rght
general 2022-05-19 06:26:21 speaking of pc2
general 2022-05-19 06:26:30 can blocks be resized?
general 2022-05-19 06:26:33 not just scaled down
general 2022-05-19 06:26:37 but stretched
general 2022-05-19 06:27:17 hmm
general 2022-05-19 06:27:18 can you like
general 2022-05-19 06:27:26 okay so
general 2022-05-19 06:27:30 would there be like a smaller grid?

general 2022-05-19 06:31:42 the spread is yes
general 2022-05-19 06:32:02 you can just put delta wings on a few of them
general 2022-05-19 06:32:09 they bump into others and cause spread without too much spread

general 2022-07-01 03:05:47 dantdm
general 2022-07-01 03:06:37 no, if you INTRODUCE yourself with the first and most important part being that you're gay, that's just cringe af
general 2022-07-01 03:07:46 also example of making it your entire personality: basing your personality around shitty tiktok trends, getting a thousand piercings, and wearing a pride flag as a cape, SIMPLY TO FIT THE GAY IMAGE

general 2022-07-01 03:10:11 to shitty trends
general 2022-07-01 03:10:15 and fitting a stereotype
general 2022-07-01 03:11:17 no, but some of the actions associated with being queer are a shitty trend that starts on tiktok or twitter
general 2022-07-01 03:12:00 wrong

general 2022-07-01 03:16:30 liking cars is a cultural phenomenon, i'll give you that
general 2022-07-01 03:16:52 it's definitely something that people are exposed to, and then again, it's something that you decide if you're interested in
general 2022-07-01 03:17:15 people who are interested in cars are interested in them for a reason
general 2022-07-01 03:17:21 for example: engineering
general 2022-07-01 03:17:31 ???
general 2022-07-01 03:17:48 also enjoying beer is just a preference lmao
general 2022-07-01 03:17:51 some people like the taste
general 2022-07-01 03:18:20 that's the difference tho, people who folow shitty trends are obnoxious about it, whereas car guys are much more to themselves about it
general 2022-07-01 03:18:26 lmao fair
