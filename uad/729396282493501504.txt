creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:34:20 swearing doesn't affect your health. smoking does. and also this:
"Don't Watch Your Mouth. Swearing Can Actually Be Good for Your Health
Studies show cursing during a physically painful event can help us better tolerate the pain.
Experts say using curse words can also help us build emotional resilience and cope with situations in which we feel that we have no control."
Also yes, because there was no hint of sarcasm and it was in a very literal sense.
creations-chat 2022-04-21 22:37:29 that's sad. i meant your own health, not someone else. And i sometimes say swears alone. It's something i do. and for flash, being sweared at it kinda a part of life, either you get over it or you don't. There's millions of other, worse things.

general 2022-04-21 23:09:34 Stock exchange
In the 14th century, Belgium lay between two major trading empires: the Mediterranean dominated by the Italians and the Baltic Sea with German Haneastic merchants. Residents in Belgium acted as intermediaries between the merchants, and innkeepers often played a central role as brokers for their customers. The Ter Beurse inn, run by the Van der Beurze family, was one of the most renowned – arguably founded in Antwerp although many accounts say Bruges – and the square in front of the inn became the leading financial and commercial centre. Shares of companies weren’t traded at this time, instead traded ‘stocks’ referred to affairs of government, businesses, trade and individual debt. Brokers would also gather local and foreign economic data from travelling guests and eventually exchange rates from various cities were announced at regular times, later leading to an organised money market. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighbouring countries and early stock markets, such as in Ghent and Rotterdam, were typically called ‘beurzen’, which is said to be the etymological origin of today’s word for exchange, ‘bourse’.

creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:17:08 yes. I honestly didn't know what title to put so I put the wheel of fortune. Also I don't have an editing software. Ever think of that?
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:19:11 Simple problems bring for simple solutions. regret posting it because the PCC is more toxic than Redditers arguing which goes first: milk or cereal.

The message is that big builds usually get more upvotes than small builds.
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:23:17 Nice.
also yes it does.
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:28:05 at this point I honestly want them to smite me.

In a short: Amongst Us.

It went from us arguing about a low effort creation I made so people talking about Among Us and random stuff.

Also my walls have asbestos because I found some old GP5 gas masks and forgot to check when they were made. <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-06-11 02:36:19 I worded that incorrectly: The gas mask itself is fine, the filter has asbestos inside.

Dave you have officially earned the title of "Shakespeareth". Thy's name ist now Shakespeareth.

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:07:18 I calculate since the bullet goes roughly around 9700th the speed of light, or Mach 11
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:07:23 My barrel would shatter
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:07:38 Not only that, it would fly out of the back of the turret
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:07:55 As the tank turns into an airplane and gets sent flying across the map
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:08:02 Mine does
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:08:10 Don’t question my goals
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:08:34 I’m on phone right now but I used about 130 magnets
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:08:51 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:09:02 Giving my unrealistically powerful tank
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:09:17 Realistic recoil
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:09:44 Also it’s not made for being realistic. I made it to obliterate anything it hits
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:09:53 Because I can
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:10:29 You just gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:10:40 Replace the bullet with a nuclear warhead
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:10:45 How? I don’t know
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:10:52 Am I gonna try? Yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:10:59 When? At like 11
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:11:09 Because yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:11:17 Soviet death fridge
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:11:27 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:11:52 The turret at this point is just a giant weight
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:12:19 And my the tanks probably gonna go at like 5 SPS
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:12:35 W o r l d   R e c o r d .
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:12:50 Fastest vehicle in PC. Totally
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:13:10 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:13:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:13:27 Irl if you had to make a tank that big
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:13:44 Might as well just make the Landkreuzer Ratte
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:13:56 I basically went
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:14:13 “Beautiful kv-2 Hull and turret”
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:14:30 “Now add a railgun for the cannon”
the-dump 2022-07-23 04:15:49 
the-dump 2022-07-23 04:15:56 Wise words
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:16:44 m
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:17:26 I’m explaining why it’s a good idea to add recoil to a railgun attached to a tank
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:19:00 Yeah hold on lemme transform into a walker then into a turret to fire my cannon
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:19:23 And still get turned into an airplane by the recoil
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:20:55 Update: according to my calculations....
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:21:09 My computer will explode if I try to add recoil from the lag

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:22:56 I use an iPhone 6 cope
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:23:23 I’m on it right now
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:23:33 I feel it overheating
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:23:42 100% safe
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:23:59 Probably
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:24:10 Especially since I’m in Florida
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:24:17 Aka Hell but hotter
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:24:41 China has every climate
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:24:46 Let’s be honest
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:25:33 Mobile game ads: please give me Rome please give me rome!
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:25:43 Since when was Rome a country
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:05 Mobile game: dang it not Siberia!
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:18 Since when did Siberia border the city of Rome
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:26 And when did it become a country
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:43 Mobile game: I might as well farm
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:46 In what?
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 04:26:53 THe ice?
general 2022-07-24 14:22:36 Hello there
general 2022-07-24 14:24:07 I mean...piggy, Arsenal, phantom forces I’m pretty sure, any game with any trace of blood has gore. Including little blood effects from guns
general 2022-07-24 14:24:44 My roles say I have image perms. I’ve been lied to by the council
general 2022-07-24 14:25:45 If I can run scripts in my game to decapitate people, turn them into balls of flesh, and snap their body in half, then yes I think that’s allowed
general 2022-07-24 14:26:09 I mean, we haven’t had to repost it for the second time yet
general 2022-07-24 14:26:43 Just put a warning for gore in the description and you’ll be fine
general 2022-07-24 14:27:25 Oh
general 2022-07-24 14:27:33 In that case
general 2022-07-24 14:27:42 You can do as much gore as you want
general 2022-07-24 14:27:52 Just put a gore warning and roblox wont care
general 2022-07-24 14:28:28 Like the goofy ahh Rated M or something screens on GTA games
general 2022-07-24 14:29:01 I know how to make it toggleable
general 2022-07-24 14:29:10 On: you play the game
general 2022-07-24 14:29:36 Off: you leave
general 2022-07-24 14:29:45 Simple enough
general 2022-07-24 14:30:37 No there’s a gub noisnepsus
general 2022-07-24 14:30:50 Yes
general 2022-07-24 14:31:19 But
general 2022-07-24 14:31:39 I recommend mid to low quality gore
general 2022-07-24 14:32:02 Or just make it toggleable which might be required
general 2022-07-24 14:32:28 Because some people have laptops that turn into thermonuclear 3 stage time bombs
general 2022-07-24 14:32:41 **My computer.**
general 2022-07-24 14:33:19 Imagine not having a laptop with an internal temp of 148 degrees Fahrenheit

general 2022-10-08 00:32:44 at that point just put a battleship cannon on it bro
general 2022-10-08 00:33:33 it's what I did for my Kv-2
general 2022-10-08 00:33:45 haven't made recoil yet
general 2022-10-08 00:34:43 that would just make me go backwards slightly
general 2022-10-08 00:34:55 my turret is very heavy and the hull is too
general 2022-10-08 00:35:11 in mail box!
general 2022-10-08 00:35:37 **More**
general 2022-10-08 00:35:56 Kv-2, specifically
general 2022-10-08 00:36:15 but I need realistic recoil for my bullet that shoots at mach 11 (which I calculated)
general 2022-10-08 00:36:24 prob goes faster but uh
general 2022-10-08 00:36:31 mach 11 is like the slowest it's gonna go
general 2022-10-08 00:36:47 **Unless the game has a stroke and clips the bullet into the side of the cannon**
general 2022-10-08 00:37:25 I want a god damn battleship cannon with 1000+ RPM
