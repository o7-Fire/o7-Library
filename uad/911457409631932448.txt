and after adding upgrade after upgrade (Radar, base protection, ERA, Gun sight,More ERA etc...)I dont have any idea what do to after and it basically looks like this.
So like do you guys have tips or ideas i could use to upgrade my aa auto cannon?

help 2022-01-08 23:35:26 I did focus mainly on pvp and now on working n the aestetics.I know theres a ot of tnt but it protects the cannon extremely well against missiles launched by planes and tanks but also to guns.
