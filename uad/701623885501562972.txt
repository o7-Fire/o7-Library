plane-crazy 2021-07-21 02:17:40 i made like a 4x3x4 double wishbone suspension thingy, does a smaller one exist? (I want the smallest things possible muahahahha)
general 2021-07-21 02:19:21 The new default avatar is so weird now, i liked bacon
general 2021-07-21 19:11:45 Motors are freaking painnn
general 2021-07-21 19:12:29 ~~imagine using motor lock~~
general 2021-07-21 19:12:46 i do
general 2021-07-21 19:13:10 a pretty trash plane
general 2021-07-21 19:13:41 no no the motor lock part of the plane was fine
general 2021-07-21 19:13:50 the shape is bad bc im bad at building
general 2021-07-21 19:14:48 why am i getting roasted? Im using motors for normal stuff
general 2021-07-21 19:14:54 not block clipping
general 2021-07-21 19:17:16 why are 2 motors placed next to each other connected?? Ahhh
general 2021-07-21 19:18:02 Like side to side the bottoms connect when graphically they don't, its so confusing
general 2021-07-21 19:19:17 I understand how it works but its annoying
general 2021-07-21 19:21:57 the hell does hardcoded to the bone mean? This game seems as much coded as any other grid based building game on roblox to me
general 2021-07-21 19:23:18 ^ that made no sense, not sure thats how Minecraft works
general 2021-07-21 19:24:02 ah that kinda makes sense, spaghetti code?
general 2021-07-21 19:25:57 Nice
