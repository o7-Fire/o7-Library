general 2022-11-27 02:31:43 2259
general 2022-11-27 02:32:00 once i get level 3 imma submit it into the vtol engineer thingy
general 2022-11-27 02:32:06 try and get expert vtol master
general 2022-11-27 02:32:12 just super rocket engines
general 2022-11-27 02:32:17 a few props and jets too
general 2022-11-27 02:32:20 but mainly super rockets
general 2022-11-27 02:32:56 what is 2259 not big
general 2022-11-27 02:33:02 no it doesnt use helium
general 2022-11-27 02:33:23 i recorded an 11 minute video explaining how it works but i cant compress it to 7mb
general 2022-11-27 02:33:32 yes it can roll pitch all that
general 2022-11-27 02:33:46 it can convert to horizontal too
general 2022-11-27 02:33:52 and has retractable landing gear
general 2022-11-27 02:34:01 and has a full on combat cargo bay
general 2022-11-27 02:34:06 and an ejection system
general 2022-11-27 02:34:14 im not even fucking with you my cargo vtol has an ejection system
general 2022-11-27 02:34:19 yeah
general 2022-11-27 02:34:46 okay so ive talked about this long enough
general 2022-11-27 02:34:50 hopefully im level 2
general 2022-11-27 02:34:56 wdym by that
general 2022-11-27 02:35:04 i use motor 2s for the vtol engines
general 2022-11-27 02:35:09 not sure if that means disconnected
general 2022-11-27 02:35:12 yeah
general 2022-11-27 02:35:15 there's no launch station
general 2022-11-27 02:35:18 or anything
general 2022-11-27 02:35:19 just the vtol
bot-central 2022-11-27 02:35:27 !rank
general 2022-11-27 02:35:34 no
general 2022-11-27 02:35:38 the uh
general 2022-11-27 02:35:41 the one i do a video on
general 2022-11-27 02:35:43 is the attack variant
general 2022-11-27 02:35:46 meaning theres no uh
general 2022-11-27 02:35:49 cargo inside
general 2022-11-27 02:35:56 just attack equipment like seats, stations, all that
general 2022-11-27 02:36:06 basically think of an ac-130
general 2022-11-27 02:36:09 but vtol

creations-chat 2022-11-27 05:24:16 Well shit I didn't expect my reviews to be that harsh
I'll have a crack at building something actually decent
general 2022-11-27 05:33:22 hey uh
general 2022-11-27 05:33:31 would any designers be keen on giving me some building tips?

creations-chat 2022-11-27 05:37:34 Alright well I'm going to work on something that isn't shit like the vtol
general 2022-11-27 05:39:26 The thing is though
general 2022-11-27 05:39:29 I have no idea how to motorlock
general 2022-11-27 05:40:05 Like yeah I understand that if you slap two motors together, disable powered and put them on lock that'll snap them together
general 2022-11-27 05:40:13 But that's the extent of my knowledge

general 2022-11-27 05:44:32 If it wasn't for my dogshoite vtol I could've gotten expert vtol engineer
general 2022-11-27 05:45:23 Let's start small
general 2022-11-27 05:45:45 How do I motorlock builds together, so that when I spawn the build unravels into something larger than the building space
general 2022-11-27 05:46:26 Folding
general 2022-11-27 05:46:27 Okay
general 2022-11-27 05:46:30 I'll look it up brb
general 2022-11-27 05:48:21 I disappear now
general 2022-11-27 05:48:45 Into my humble private server to learn the ins and outs of intricate plane crazy design
general 2022-11-27 05:49:35 🧌
general 2022-11-27 05:57:50 So, folding with cameras allow for the really large builds?
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 06:26:32 I'm starting something i guess
general 2022-11-27 06:37:37 <#384021699466756107>?

general 2022-11-28 06:26:23 let's go
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:39:30 Reworking the paintjob, control surfaces, and overall aesthetic of my VTOL to please the high expectations of the crowds for when I submit it
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:48:37 
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:48:53 will probably rework the vtol thrusters too
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:51:27 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:56:29 it doesn't have any wings yet
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:56:45 i stripped the thing down, reworking all the cosmetics
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:56:49 and a few technical things
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 06:57:31 like I replaced the ejection system, so instead of jettisoning the canopy I detonate it, allowing for a smoother fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 07:12:19 redid tail
