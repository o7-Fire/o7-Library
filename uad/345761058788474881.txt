creations-chat 2019-11-24 09:07:45 Is there a way to make some sort of stabilizer to keep your creations from falling over or tipping?

help 2021-02-13 09:36:34 How do I get image perms?
Also, How do you make very big creations float at regular gravity? Is there a certain amount of helium blocks you have to place in order for it to be almost like zero gravity, or is there an easy method?
help 2021-02-13 09:40:34 My build has about 4000 blocks in it (3919 to be exact), and I wanna know how to make it float before finishing it.
help 2021-02-13 09:41:02 It's only A Third done
help 2021-02-13 09:41:14 So I expect it to have about 9000+ blocks
help 2021-02-13 09:41:21 Maybe 10k
help 2021-02-13 10:16:53 K
help 2021-02-13 10:16:56 Thank you
general 2021-02-14 02:28:41 Bro I want image perms so I can show off half of my KFC Infinity, so I'm just gonna be here for a while
general 2021-02-14 02:29:02 Dame da ne
general 2021-02-14 02:29:36 I haven't heard Big Chungus since I was in 7th grade
general 2021-02-14 02:29:46 so 3 years
general 2021-02-14 02:29:56 wait

general 2021-02-14 02:32:09 But Big Chungus was a thing in 2019

help 2021-02-14 16:23:26 Heyyaaaaa um, is there a quick way for anyone to explain how pilot seats work? I'm trying to make escape pods for my KFC Infinity
help 2021-02-14 16:24:04 I looked up on yt but nothing is there, just a lot of "ejector seat" tutorials
help 2021-02-14 16:24:20 Yeah, but when I try to control things with it, it doesn't work
help 2021-02-14 16:24:43 Are friends able to control it?
help 2021-02-14 16:24:54 Awww
help 2021-02-14 16:24:57 That's sad
help 2021-02-14 16:26:52 This game is hardcoded right? So would that get in the way of them making pilot seats useable by friends?
help 2021-02-14 16:33:43 Aight! Thank you, I don't mind how long it takes, so I hope if they were to change things they really take their time.
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 23:31:06 Holy shit what did they do to anchor blocks with physics on
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 23:31:17 Or
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 23:31:22 What'd rick do
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 23:52:17 Seriously, some of my builds don't work because the anchor blocks were changed, what happened??
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 23:52:50 Physics on anchor blocks changed completely
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 17:01:29 So, is rick aware that lights are hella broken? They just turn off whenever they want
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:47:40 Looks like that too
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:47:51 to me too*
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:49:45 GOODNESS
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:50:48 The front i
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:50:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:51:25 Tutorials are rash either way
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:51:30 trash*
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:51:40 especially when you flex them
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:52:33 A man told me that he was allowed to flex his tutorial build because it took him a long time.
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:52:59 Meanwhile I took 9 in game days to make my first big build
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:53:14 which I think sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:53:16 I'm slow
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:53:29 With words yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:54:20 Sketchfab is the best lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:55:23 I'm confused as to why my name is still readheadedzombie, but I changed it over a year ago
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:55:34 Shredders are trash
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:55:44 Trash as in broken
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:55:56 noo
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:56:02 Do not say that
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:56:53 A guy caught up to my UNSC Artemis-Class Battlecruiser with a bunch of shredders, and I was going 11k speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:57:26 Conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:57:28 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:57:48 It's 12k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:58:25 It's a battlecruiser
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:58:31 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:58:33 UNSC
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:58:34 Halo
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:59:09 Why did rick change the physics on anchor blocks taht have physics on?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 18:59:26 Most of my builds suck because of it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:02:45 GOD I'm getting annoyed because the lights on my build keep randomly turning off
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:03:02 Rick needs to fix that
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:04:00 OH
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:04:06 Y'all know Jason, right?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:04:53 On his discord server, we were al talking about an exploiter who made his own script to copy saves
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:05:01 The dude who made the infinity
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:05:08 UNSC Infinity
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:07:25 Well uh, as I was saying, me and a couple guys tested an exploiter to see how big of a save file he can steal and it doesn't matter the size. The guy told us to tell rick that he sucks at patching exploits
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:08:42 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:08:44 We did
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:08:52 He said because he's lazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:09:08 Which is just stupid
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:56:10 I just realized something, why doesn't rick just add a collision system where if you fly very fast into something, it breaks your vehicle? It would probably fix issues with shredders and make them harder to use
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:56:51 I don't see how adding a collision system would hurt anything else
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:57:31 how would adding that hurt any other core mechanic?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:00:57 The attack on titan
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:01:08 There was an attempt
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:02:25 It's just plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:03:02 I can't post ANY of my builds
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:03:16 Especially my biggest one
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:03:28 I want to get ranks but I'm too scared to post on here
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:04:30 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:04:33 wait
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:04:39 I JUST REMEMBERED
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:04:45 This is an old name
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:04:52 I changed my name a year ago lmao
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:05:33 I ain't doin that, cuz I don't wanna get followed
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:05:34 Hold on
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:06:12 Does looking up old acount names show your current account name?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:07:21 Well shit
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:07:47 Looking up my account's old name shows my current name
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:07:59 fuuuuuuck
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:08:39 Post a video to youtube first
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:09:57 Record a short video saying it's your ship, and that it was stolen, post it and then finish editting the real video
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:11:08 It's people with no realization of other people's feelings
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:12:36 someone with no sympathy nor empathy, at least online
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:14:55 You can get 8 months of a private server with one dollar
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:14:57 Not that bad
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:18:57 No, just make it so all the saves have your name as an undeleteable object that floats at the front of your plot. It'll be VERY big
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:19:09 not on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:19:50 Just have the account name, and ID
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:21:37 Are the vip servers on here available to everyone?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:22:13 How long could it take to get a rank?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:23:03 I'm very confused at how to do that
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:24:38 Oh jesus
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:24:40 Um
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:25:06 Does a UNSC Ship count as rocket? or designer?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:27:15 How'd we figure out who's targetted?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:40:40 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:40:55 I'm gonna submit my Omega Flowey build
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:41:10 Omega Flowey in a box
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:41:25 I have a vip server
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:41:53 No I am
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:42:16 I thought you said are you sure because of the copying stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:42:50 Ah

plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:07:24 it has a cannon on the bottom back, but it sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:08:56 What's that supposed to mean
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:09:49 Oh i noticed something with my dropship
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:10:57 Also, most of them can't be changed, because they're based off of certain things
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:11:04 like the dropship

plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:07 
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:26 I can change a little bit
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:29 However
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:42 Motorlocking some parts will break the entire thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:46 I tried
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:49 alredy
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:13:51 already*
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:14:14 Ok,
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:14:31 It won't be able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:14:52 It took two days to get flying
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:15:02 Since there's two forks and the back
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:15:12 It can't use engines
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:15:25 It uses helium to be lighter
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:15:40 It does
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:15:56 The helium keeps it at 0 grav almost
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:16:06 Rocket thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:16:30 I already motor locked thrusters in it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:17:26 I also am in a discord server, specifically for Halo builds. They all said it was perfectly fine.
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:17:43 And they are guys that practically live off of halo
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:18:19 The artstyle and design of the Spirit Dropship has changed over each and every halo game
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:20:05 Butter

plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:33:49 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:35:19 because
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:35:21 It's halo
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:35:53 There's no real reason to have the infinity sign there
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:36:01 But I kept it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:36:12 Because it took a while to make
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:36:19 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:36:28 MAC Cannon
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 21:36:51 I still need add the MAC Cannon those

plane-crazy 2021-04-28 15:17:28 Did rick reverse some updates or somthin'? My big builds used to run very well about a month ago after he updated the game and now they run almost worse than it used to
plane-crazy 2021-04-28 15:22:14 Well this makes the game almost un-playable
plane-crazy 2021-04-28 15:23:02 Also does anyone else have an issue where if one build gets close to another build, the game just kills itself?

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:44:24 For plane crazy to have
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:44:40 It wouldn't be more plots or whitelisted building
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:44:52 It would be a bigger map
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:45:05 The map is so small
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:45:23 You fly over it in 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:45:51 I wish the map was at least 5 times bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:08 No
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:21 That would mean flying over it in 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:29 but 5 times
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:33 50 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:37 and 6 times
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:46:41 a minute
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:47:33 No

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:47:44 You can fly over the map now
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:47:54 In 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:47:59 3 times 10

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:09 5 times 10
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:11 50
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:17 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:22 No one said 30 times 5
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:38 Uh yeah

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:48:58 times 5
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:49:03 the size
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:49:26 The map is too small
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:49:39 Especially if rick adds more plots
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:50:12 Faisl
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:50:21 I'll explain it to you
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:50:31 Real dumbed down so you'll understand
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:50:40 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:51:20 Using 2 propellers on this thing makes it go 300
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:51:24 Oops
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:51:28 Not that thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:51:41 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:03 Having more area to fly over?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:12 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:22 Mk
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:39 What's the point of more plots?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:44 It would be more laggy.
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:52:57 What's the point of whitelisted building?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:53:02 You did
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:53:38 ^
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:53:54 Dude.
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:00 You asked for three things.
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:10 "for me it would be"
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:13 Know what
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:16 Just shut up
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:22 I ain't talkin to you
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:42 I didn't though
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:54:47 So
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:09 I said I wished the map was at least 5 times more big, you said there's no point for it
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:13 Who started it?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:15 You did
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:33 There would be no argument if you didn't say what's the point of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:36 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:42 Because the map is boring
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:50 Land vehicles have barely any area
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:55:56 And boats have no area
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:56:04 Not a big enough area
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:56:40 Let me correct you, I meant no harm saying I wanted a bigger map, you meant harm by starting an argument AND calling me dumb

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:59:40 I meant harming in a "meaning to trigger" kind of way
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 19:59:51 Not my fault if you take it as something else
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 20:00:10 But like I said earlier
