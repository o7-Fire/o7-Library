plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:33:25 üòê
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:33:29 i'm leaving
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:33:34 xd
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:33:36 jk
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:41:50 bet you wont
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:41:53 you wont
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 02:52:09 Which would be cool too
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:23:12 I wish we had flatter blocks so we can build more realistic planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:23:58 I was going to build a black wing but it doesnt look right without flatter blocks.
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:39:09 mhm
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:39:14 and bulding aspect
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:39:19 so things arent as blocky
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:39:45 So like jets, they end up looking like a small sized passenger plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-03 23:39:52 when we use all of these bulky blocks.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:22:14 The only thing that's really hard about trying to replicate the cooler looking planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:22:27 is the sharp corners or the coned noses.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:22:37 for say
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:22:41 if i wanted to build this
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:22:44 
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:23:12 i would have a difficult time doing so because of the coned noses and the ridged edges.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:23:21 This is the f117 stealth.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:23:31 Made by lockheed
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:24:17 Well it's possible
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:24:46 but aesthetically and officially like the picture is impossible at the moment.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:25:15 It would end up looking blocky, Too unrealistic.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:29:59 Can someone teach me how to build a coned nose
