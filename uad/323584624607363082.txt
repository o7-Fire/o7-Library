creations-chat 2020-09-17 13:50:49 yeah but making it more flush with the body is hard because its so close to it mainly the only other way to make it look good is if I move the landing gear door over more
creations-chat 2020-09-17 13:51:02 but I got a idea hold on
creations-chat 2020-09-17 13:51:50 true I could motor lock the side body so I could have more room so build
creations-chat 2020-09-17 13:54:48 so like the wheels fold up, then the door that they are attached to?

creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:41:31 Oh and the ropes were like that cause I had them lose so when I turn the rotor on the heli doesn’t shoot up in the air
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:41:44 But I’ll mess around with changing that to motors
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:42:34 If the ropes were tighter it would start taking off right away
