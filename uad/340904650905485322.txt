Additional note: this was just recently, I think they rejoined another server. (as of 9/4/2020, 13:36). I'm also worried they might try and use another account if banned since the lag machine was ball spam.
Note 2: shortly after they left, half the server also did, resulting in only 3 players including myself left.

creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:00:21 Osprey F1.A (first variant, VTOL possible but vertical landing is very hard).
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:00:46 yes i turned off the engines in flight for a screenshot
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:02:15 also if i were to cover the top the engines wouldn't turn
creations-chat 2020-04-09 14:02:25 thus an Osprey F1.B, second variant no VTOL.

help 2020-04-09 18:18:28 In front of or behind the centre of gravity/flight shouldn't cause any problems <@!295221174823157771>
help 2020-04-09 18:18:45 To the left or right, however, even if you have the same amount of conveyors on both sides, may cause problems.
help 2020-04-09 18:19:06 however now that I think of it
help 2020-04-09 18:19:24 in front of the centre might also cause problems, how it might I'm still thinking about
help 2020-04-09 18:19:46 yeah in front of idk
help 2020-04-09 18:20:03 Behind is a definitive working propulsion system however.
help 2020-04-09 18:20:19 Directly at the centre is also likely to work.

creations-chat 2020-04-11 21:12:57 and also get more upvotes than said person you're attempting to put down
creations-chat 2020-04-11 21:13:11 it shows you're worse than others however
creations-chat 2020-04-11 21:13:19 which one

creations-chat 2020-04-11 21:14:31 i'mma head out soon
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:15 sadly
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:15 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:45 if you wanted to build a multi-person craft
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:55 e.g. a bomber with moveable turrets
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:15:58 you'd have to make them separately
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:16:11 and then i imagine you'd have to use a claw to ensure the other creations don't fall out
plane-crazy 2020-04-11 21:17:31 yes

general 2020-04-12 12:40:53 why is it the good creations get so many downvotes (in most scenarios from what i've seen)
general 2020-04-12 12:40:57 and the useless ones get the upvotes
general 2020-04-12 12:41:12 just take a look at <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-04-12 12:41:24 B2 spirit bomber 9 downvotes
general 2020-04-12 12:41:47 but
general 2020-04-12 12:42:01 there's some creation of soldier from TF2 in several poses
general 2020-04-12 12:42:03 and even though it's useless
general 2020-04-12 12:42:17 then THEY get the upvotes
general 2020-04-12 12:42:38 i prefer quality and usefulness over the design
general 2020-04-12 12:42:55 in my case though
general 2020-04-12 12:43:08 i make a good recreation of an S.E.5
general 2020-04-12 12:43:10 from WW1
general 2020-04-12 12:43:47 probably bad angle and yes the gun on top is intentional
general 2020-04-12 12:44:04 it's an attempted recreation
general 2020-04-12 12:44:10 and then there's also my fokker dr.1
general 2020-04-12 12:44:31 
general 2020-04-12 12:45:00 no
general 2020-04-12 12:45:04 i built the S.E.5 from that actually
general 2020-04-12 12:45:14 they're both WW1
general 2020-04-12 12:45:26 so saying that isn't surprising, some planes followed similar designs
general 2020-04-12 12:45:44 it's my attempt at least
general 2020-04-12 12:45:56 i've tried making an airco d.h.2 before

creations-chat 2020-04-12 13:44:31 when he says not including seat
creations-chat 2020-04-12 13:44:40 he means one block not including the seat
creations-chat 2020-04-12 13:44:44 the seat counts as a block

bug-reports 2020-04-14 09:38:00 This shouldn't happen in real life, but for some reason it happens in Plane Crazy. When retracting small/tiny landing gear, the entire plane moves down instead of just the landing gear moving up.

creations-chat 2020-04-14 14:09:20 "The folklore is: ... was a P-38 Lightning pilot and had to bail out. Well early on this was fatal for many P-38 pilots as they got killed on the cross stabilizer between the two nacelles. ... A remedy for this was eventually a pilot's seat that was ejected from the cockpit, a forerunner of today's versions."

general 2020-04-24 18:19:55 read my status, banning's true but unsure about security
general 2020-04-30 16:07:32 has anybody suggested decal blocks yet
general 2020-04-30 16:07:38 i would but i'm too lazy to get a rank
general 2020-04-30 16:07:50 ?
general 2020-04-30 16:08:04 nah
general 2020-04-30 16:08:11 decal blocks are better
general 2020-04-30 16:08:16 you get to insert any decal from roblox
general 2020-04-30 16:08:36 that's on upload
general 2020-04-30 16:08:42 roblox filters decals on upload
general 2020-04-30 16:08:44 also
general 2020-04-30 16:08:47 it's literally just a text block but decals not text
general 2020-04-30 16:08:58 you could duplicate text blocks
general 2020-04-30 16:09:02 rewrite the code to decals
general 2020-04-30 16:09:04 **and done**
general 2020-04-30 16:09:15 then cap the decals a lot lower than other blocks
general 2020-04-30 16:09:25 i could work with 5
general 2020-04-30 16:09:47 makes sense
general 2020-04-30 16:10:03 we have enough already, they spilled into another section and half blocks
general 2020-04-30 16:10:52 you are correcc

plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:34:07 <@456226577798135808> i could easily make a train chassis tbh
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:34:27 it's pretty simple in reality
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:34:30 and pretty easy
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:35:21 might do the suspension in a bit
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:35:28 i could easily convert my E2 into a bouncing one
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:35:37 (yes I made an E2 Tank Engine)
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:36:09 it's basically reality counterpart of thomas the tank engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:36:17 thus the similarity
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:36:36 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:36:49 i'll convert my E2 into a bouncing E2 then
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:36:54 it'll be easy
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:37:18 i'll do it after i finish a piece of homework
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 15:37:22 and if i remember
