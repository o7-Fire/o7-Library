general 2023-05-28 20:06:59 the moderators are active

general 2023-07-09 19:46:29 well development is active, but that is just accessories to make up for the delay

creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:58:34 what should i fill these ones with (i will make the first one have the same floor as the 2nd one unless someone has an idea against it)

Its for my core sim i guess
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:01:15 it is my core simulator and these are the 2 building on the roof, i just finished them and have yet to figure out what to use them for
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:03:18 i will send an image of the storage rooms finished today or tomorrow üôÇ

creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:49:19 yeah.. BUT it is confirmed that it is in development
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:51:24 does this look like a proper storage or does anyone have tips for more?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:53:26 whats wrong with the image, is that a pic of u fuzzy?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:57:22 well unless whoever is the rightful owner of that picture says that it is ok to post that to an entire community server, i get why fuzzy isnt letting it slide for multiple reasons including that

fuzzy is also asking you to refrain so it would be great if you could listen
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:00:33 The argument is about FleetOfRetribution posting a face mirrored picture of FuzzytheWookie_007's boyfriend in here and fuzzy is asking him politely to refrain in wich fleet refuses, anyways i gotta go to bed, see ya tomorrow
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:10:39 Yesterday i asked in this chat what to use these building for,  someone answered with Storage, does this look good?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:15:54 it looks like an air and liquid filtering pipe room doesent it
general 2023-07-17 11:18:57 is it possible to stop lights from just randomly turn off and having to turn EVERY LIGHT ON again?
general 2023-07-17 11:19:08 or is it just the worst game feature
general 2023-07-17 11:22:59 i get the joke, but seriously it haunts me every time, got an actual answer for my question?
general 2023-07-17 11:23:31 dont tell me its an actual feature..
bot-central 2023-07-17 11:27:32 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:29:20 what causes lights to just randomply switch off and having to manually switch them on again and if i can, how do you fix it?
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:29:51 its been bugging me for a while and its annoying
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:31:43 specifically large builds, im going insane over it and i dont want it
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:32:23 then what do you do to see
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:32:36 at night?
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:33:08 i litterally need night for the atmopshere to my core
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:33:21 night makes it easy to light up specific areas
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:33:53 so its ''kinda'' necessary to have my lights NOT TURN OFF EVERY TIME
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:39:34 this is a fresh room in my core simulation and i dont have any ideas myself for it, what should i use it for?

i kinda wanna see if i can make a freezer, but if anyone else has ideas, i'd be happy to see what i can do
creations-chat 2023-07-17 11:50:07 rod storage?

**Edit: **any other ideas?
bot-central 2023-07-17 12:00:13 ?shelp
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:04:52 does anyone have any other ideas apart from any kind of storage?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:07:14 its on the 2nd floor, so thats gonna be a bit difficult, got any other ideas apart from a garage?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:10:53 i still dont know what to use it for.

Its on the 2nd floor, empty, needs ideas, i dont have any ideas that will work, its in a core facillity, and im still stuck on what to do with it
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:14:20 problem with most ideas is that i dont have a proper plan yet for any of them and having other ideas would make it a bit easier, so im just questioning around on what to do.

and btw the guy in between us is just the average discord user
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:16:57 any other ideas?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:19:39 not sure if it'll fit the theme, but i'll try anyways, if you got any other ideas on mind, just reply with them, ill be building an office i guess

i've gotten lots of hate here but that didnt stop me from working
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:53:37 it didnt stop me from posting a nearly 10k block build and hoping for the best
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:56:41 you shouldnt let a bad community tell you what to do.

thats the worst thing you can do at this point.

You should just keep working on your creations and at some point, you may take your time and you may have a good time.

If you want to talk to someone who has had massive hate here, you can dm me
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:59:56 peapole downvote stuff because they are so jealous that they go for trying to make the authors quit their stuff

its a, HORRIBLE community
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:05:11 with all honesty, these communities are full ass and most of the assholes you find here are just stupidly jealous idiots who think that downvoting and hating on peapole that did nothing will depress them into suicide, it dont matter if you are good or bad, you will get hate because peapole are either jealous or asbolute no lifers.

but what you shouldnt do is let them win, thats a big mistake, dont let their shit get to you and keep going, build, expand and improve, thats the best i can give.

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 17:51:06 i honestly just wanna learn to use motorlock..
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 17:51:51 i already did, no tutorial shows how to use motorlocking to its potential as far as i know
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 17:52:31 honestly, i think for now, imma stick with the suggested boat..

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 17:53:50 well.. my first obstacle is that idk how to use it
