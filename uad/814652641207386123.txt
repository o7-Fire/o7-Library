creations-chat 2021-08-28 03:38:25 What the hell
creations-chat 2021-08-28 15:41:07 Yes sir, a problem. You apparently didn’t see the difference, if I wanted to exactly copy him I would have done it. The only reference I used from him was the frickin motor lock. It flies very different then the tutorial one.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 15:44:19 Just because I colored it gray and it kind of looks like the jet in the tutorial doesn’t mean it is the jet in the tutorial. Like I said, only thing I used from him was the motor locking. It still would have been done the same way(the motor locks) because that’s how u build a motor lock tower...
creations-chat 2021-08-28 16:20:56 “Modified” not “exactly copied”<:what:644996672048463942>
