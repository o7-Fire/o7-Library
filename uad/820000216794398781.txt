plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:18:35 <@448677698773057547> you have any notes on this?
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:19:03 doubt it seeing as you are taking the time to bother me on a discord server for a lego game
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:19:13 honestly i didnt think of that
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:27:11 lmao

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:27:55 he's calling on you to roast me since he cant do it himself
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:28:37 yeah its not that hard
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:28:45 cursive takes like 5 minutes to learn 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:29:05 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:30:42 if you're writing why are you on discord trying to roast someone for no reason 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:31:06 ok and
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:32:11 i dont care about you being an orange name, i asked a simple question and you decided to take the time out of your day to roast me for having a white name on a discord account that is based on a lego game
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:32:37 so thats kind of a stupid mindset im ngl
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:34:04 the fact you also decided to brag you were a level higher than me when i didnt bother to send any messages in here for like 4 years is kind of stupid, again
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 17:34:47 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
