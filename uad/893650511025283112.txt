bug-reports 2022-02-10 04:52:44 Speakers stop playing audio once i zoom out and zoom back in.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 04:54:08 And i cannot post video proof, great.
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 05:01:13 Same, I joined just to ask since the horns on my tripod, including other noises, stopped working after zooming out and back in.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:34:19 You didnt read what i said properly. I zoom out and as soon as i zoom back in, the sound doesnt play, despite being on loop.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:34:32 I press the toggle keys, doesnt play either.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:43:04 Its never happened before, it started this morning and continued through the entire day.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 10:43:52 How though? I try to re toggle the noise and any other noise for that matter, and they dont play either.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:01:17 And what are those things it depends on?
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:29:04 Glitch.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:54:15 Because i dont have perms because i just joined for help mate.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 11:56:02 I see, someone finally mentioned that there was an issue with them. Thank you.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 12:02:00 Some builds have the issue but some also do not.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 12:02:09 I have only discovered that recently.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:19:22 This is a bug report channel and I am reporting a bug. And yet you call me dumb, as said by jacekilla, Audio has permanence and continues to play when you zoom out and back in.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:19:26 Conversation ended.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:23:37 Same here.
bug-reports 2022-02-10 20:29:18 Well thats a fair enough fix, ill play without thruster noises until its gone.

help 2022-12-25 00:53:51 the angle lock wing is just trapdoors
help 2022-12-25 00:54:22 the front part of it flies fine, but when its attached to the main wing its troublesome

help 2022-12-25 00:56:43 also yes its an ADF 11F
help 2022-12-25 00:57:02 i would recolor it to an ADFX 10 but my ADFX 10 slot is taken up by my hoverdrive conversion of the ADF 11F
help 2022-12-25 00:57:20 i have the sprocket one and the hover one
bot-central 2022-12-25 00:57:59 !rank

creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:19:07 Suffering from success
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:21:11 you can try setting a few motors to the same keys so you dont have to press so many buttons as well

and what is with this 2 minute timer even the <#384025409945337856>  doesnt have this slowmode

motor reset has been annoying the hell out of me because it goes asymmetrical
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:25:28 who wants to see something trash
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:27:36 bro this is what my ADF 11F used to look like before months of redoing it
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:29:52 Damn how many blocks is that? I thought my 1.6K block plane was big
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:32:04 Before you go ill ask one question

What is up with the slowmode here?
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:37:14 You think you could make it the Rogue Nation F14?
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:40:41 hidden 🤓  emoji (CIA classified)
help 2022-12-25 04:44:26 so im assuming your making an ADF 11, hows it going right now
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:46:43 By far the best camo
help 2022-12-25 04:53:29 Alright, good luck on it
help 2022-12-25 04:53:39 And dont make the mistake of overlocking it like me
help 2022-12-25 04:53:48 It becomes a pain to make it perform decently
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:31:59 Its kinda more a sudden straight transition, theres a little curve though
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:38:15 Ive seen some before on youtube lol
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:41:15 This shape is very annoying to make if your making a tiny one. Most of the time youd just have the entire wing move which makes it have a sharp edge and no small wings at the front because of how deltas work

Also all that motorlock was me angle locking 2 much
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:43:59 True, hover drives kill my FPS in publics
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:49:02 And heres a goofy work in progress HK Aerial (yes another one) using the Genysis design, and before you ask, NO i am not making that spider thing
creations-chat 2022-12-25 05:54:36 Long

help 2022-12-25 11:07:22 I dont really mind if any rando joins lmao
help 2022-12-25 11:23:20 You can put conveyor drives in them i think
creations-chat 2022-12-25 15:17:46 pretty damn nice
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:24:01 this is all ill do today
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:17 https://tenor.com/view/ace-combat-ace-combat-zero-f15-pixy-jet-gif-27034461
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:41 nah thats an ADFX 02
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:53 
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:59 its Belkan
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:26:17 Are lasers shit?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:26:21 Thats a laser on top
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:27:10 i mean at least it has ECM technology
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:27:20 you can only kill it by firing at its intakes lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:27:42 ok but on a serious note it shouldnt deflect bullets thats just bs
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:28:39 review this plane for me
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:29:03 ADF 11F
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:29:17 Yes detaching
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:29:41 cockpit's basically camera lens
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:29:53 the system for it is called the C.O.F.F.I.N
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:10 ADF 01 Falken had the COFFIN as a buncha hexagonal screens
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:27 the 11F i think you plug your brain into it or some
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:44 Yeah the 11F cockpit isnt any screens or anything
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:30:47 Just a grainy filter
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:31:12 The ones you fight ingame are unmanned anyways
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:31:27 I think the having a piloted version was an excuse to get it flyable by players while removing the detaching element
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:31:52 I read somewhere only the UAV version can detach its front
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:05 also yeah i made the 11f
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:48 Yeah i have a version with a bit more coloring but its sprockets
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:33:54 im working to unlagify the hoverdrive version
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:34:10 I need to remove the entire angle wing assembly and use camlock for it instead
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:34:36 I mean, decreasing the 2k block count might help lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:35:56 The majority of wings are all gone
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:36:56 
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:45:00 should i work on the camlock wings or should i just work on Morgan
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:55:11 getting there
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:55:42 i had to move my main pilot seat to a position where i have to get out and enter the nose unit otherwise the camlock detached with the front part
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:55:57 also hello computer
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:57:35 It is a raven
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:57:44 Im tryna reduce block counts
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:57:51 But yeah it detaches
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:02 Not really to do with weight
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:03 its uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:05 Lag lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:21 Im removing an entire anglelock assembly to reduce it by hopefully a ton
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:26 Using camlock instead
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:45 Its basically putting a mini plane onto a frame using a disconnector
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:58:49 And maybe some motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:59:02 To make it blend into the body sorta
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:59:39 Yeah its kinda like taht
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 05:04:05 This camlock is a pain in the backside
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 05:04:10 I need a break
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 05:05:04 Interior? Like buildings?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 05:54:29 Sharp wings :sad:
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 06:13:40 33fps, a small victory
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 06:16:28 OHH MAN I KNOW ITS JUST 33 FPS BUT AFTER 20 FPS THIS FEELS LIKE HEAVEN
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 06:20:17 f15 better in my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 06:20:24 it looks cooler
creations-chat 2022-12-26 06:58:01 nope

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 08:27:58 yes i did use that one video on youtube, the cobra guide thing
creations-chat 2022-12-26 08:31:10 cockpit looks funny
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 08:39:16 talking about shaders i only use them to make the game look more gritty such as in this image
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 08:39:49 normal plane crazy map too vibrant
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 09:19:48 I use both hover and conveyors
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 09:39:15 conveyor drives are good for boosting the hoverdrive to max speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 09:40:45 in terms of structures and stuff yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 09:40:55 im talking about the coloring

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:47:28 this answers everything
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:47:47 flying backwards
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:48:12 its some conveyor glitch
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:48:21 i got it off some goofy yt vid
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:00 you can put conveyors inside the build
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:03 they dont need to be loose
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:15 and just spam their activation key
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:23 while tryna do some goofy manuever like what i did
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyjxjg4NWu0
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:51 okay you know what just watch part of this i just used part of the video for it
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:50:00 easy modifications
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:50:16 to teach you hwo to break the game i think
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:50:53 i think ive pulled more than 500 with the way i fly
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:05 its mainly the start where they add weight and put conveyors in
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:16 somehow the conveyors let you retain momentum thats how ive been flying reverse
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:24 as long as you spam them
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:40 damn
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:42 i feel you
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:52:26 skip to abt 28 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:52:47 very painful
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:53:14 hm, do you think you could get a keyboard that doesnt do that?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:53:54 conveyor drives exist though
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:54:04 you can use them to boost you to max speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:54:10 then disable them
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:54:28 that too
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:55:03 speaking about my "about me" i think i will do a cobra manuever gaming chair now

plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:18:10 This is so sad
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:18:23 Can you use a spring for that instead
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:19:10 hold on
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:19:26 you use springs instead of disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:19:44 a lot of them will cause them to get stuck in the build though
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:20:14 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:20:40 ive seen worse i think thats ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:20:59 when its colored it will blend in
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:21:39 the red part of the spring faces the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:21:49 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:21:54 all you really need is
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:21:55 break weld
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:22:20 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:22:51 ill show how i do it on motorlock stacks
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:23:22 theres other ways too
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:23:23 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:23:27 i think that will work though the one you did
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:24:00 try what you did first if it doesnt work try the method i used
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:25:18 this one is more compact
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:25:46 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:25:49 yeah thats the issue with them
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:25:52 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:03 only replace the disconnectors that are exposed
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:12 youll have less spring to deal with
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:26:56 the ones causing that stud to be visible
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:27:18 could you send a screenshot of your build unloaded
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:27:41 i could get a better idea on what to do
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:29:30 ok i see how its done
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:30:12 try this
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:30:28 the side opposite to the red part will weld permanently btw
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:30:37 every other side wont weld permanently and will disconnect when the spring is triggered with "break weld" on
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:32:16 let me try another method, ill try with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:32:28 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/1057572519114178580/image.png
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:33:55 this could help
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:33:57 but
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:34:03 it does pull the motorlock stack down a little bit
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:34:23 actually
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:34:24 you can do this
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:35:01 i think it would
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:35:11 it gives a bit less space
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:35:24 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:35:29 it does stop the motorlock from locking so it should work with anglelock
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:35:43 studs will be like this
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:12 looking at how your build is going right now, this shouldnt be exposed
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:47 okay
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:53 that should be an easy fix
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:57 youd have to remove
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:58 wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:36:59 tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:37:21 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:37:37 nvm i think you can keep the wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:38:40 did you remove the middle wing
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:11 yeah lol i made another mistake as well
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:14 you can keep all of them
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:15 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:31 i kinda deal with exposed pieces a lot
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:45 if its a plane you can fly it into something
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:39:50 should help get them out
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:40:12 or if your plane is hollow
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:40:17 make the internal solid
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:40:31 and springs on the other?
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:41:07 try this
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:41:46 
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:46:31 just talk alot
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:46:44 the bot gives levels
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:47:04 theres probably a timer between each message that counts
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:47:16 pretty sure its level 3 you can send images
plane-crazy 2022-12-28 08:47:51 i dont recommend spamming like that though lmao

general 2023-01-07 10:06:05 The videogame industry has been covering something up for many, many years since the inception of gaming.  Most games have been implemented with a "visual hazard", or a "Cognitohazard"  as a way to earn money. The cognitohazard is simple, however it requires one has a device such as a keyboard or controller. Through unknown means, a person will become greatly addicted to using a keyboard in conjunction with a "game", which can be installed onto a computer or console. The screen, or "game" responds to the inputs on the controller, and appears to give a release of dopamine leading to 'addiction'. In some cases, one may become angry during the process, usually in competitive games. This is believed by many to be correlated to the fact that games reduce patience. If one fails in a game, they may have to wait a short amount of time; which to a normal person or newly affected person is fine, but to a person affected by such hazards heavily they will become frustrated. Another reason can be the reactions of other people affected playing the same game; if it is multiplayer. The person will not want to be classified as a "noob" or laughed at by others.

More on the visual hazard industries appear to implement into their games, the hazard is almost irreversible if not treated early. For some people, the hazard may affect them more, and some may not even be affected. Affected people are classed as "Gamers". Gamers are not usually seen outside, only in houses or basements. Typically, Gamers suffer a variety of issues, many of which relate to sleep. Most gamers are seen up at 3-am playing games- exposing them further to the cognitohazard making it irreversible. Some do not sleep, and eventually die due to sleep deprivation. Gamers are also not seen to be able to hold jobs and are socially inept.

If you believe a person you know is starting to be affected by such hazards, stop them immediately. If a person you know is irreversibly affected, contact your local mental institute.

creations-chat 2023-01-27 17:15:43 ok ill admit the shaders suck but the build is quite good probably hall of fame worthy if everyone wasnt so biased against real builds like that
whats a mirage 69420 and why does it matter in this situation? thats an F/A 18
creations-chat 2023-01-27 17:20:10 ive been forced to highlight the details
starting off with

engines
exposed lock
the sign with mcdonalds doodoo
those sick engines at the front (its a scifi F/A 18, so those engines make it look even more scifi)
fake maintenance person dummy to solidify the fact that this is an F/A 18, as F/A 18's need maintenance every now and then. since it is scifi, there is a crew member to fix stuff mid flight! cool as shit!

change my mind
