general 2023-07-15 22:08:09 The ADF-01 FALKEN (sometimes referred to as the ADF-01F[2][3]) is a powerful fighter aircraft and the first production model in the Advanced Dominance Fighter series. It was chronologically the first aircraft in Strangereal history to feature a fully enclosed cockpit, and one of the first to be flown in combat by an autonomous artificial intelligence.

general 2023-07-15 22:19:14 hold on let me check the araments of the prinz eugen
general 2023-07-15 22:19:53 The Prinz Eugen's primary armaments consists of eight 203 mm/60 SK C/34 cannons arranged in four twin turrets mounted A-Bs-Xs-Y. While not the most powerful gun of its rank, it is still effective at dealing damage to all kinds of targets. The gun has a good reload time of 12 seconds (ace crew) and has a decent firing arc, giving the Prinz Eugen a consistent damage output against enemy ships.
general 2023-07-15 22:20:26 its from the warthunder oficcial wiki. I typed this out
general 2023-07-15 22:20:35 ye its pretty decent

While not the most powerful gun of its rank, it is still effective at dealing damage to all kinds of targets. The gun has a good reload time of 12 seconds (ace crew) and has a decent firing arc, giving the Prinz Eugen a consistent damage output against enemy ships.

The 203 mm guns has three shell choice; an average HE shell with 8.8 kg of TNT, a SAP shell with decent penetration (160 mm at 10 km) and sizeable filler of 5.35 kg of TNT, and a powerful APCBC shell which have very high penetration (265 mm at 10 km), this allows the Prinz Eugen to deal damage against heavily-armoured dreadnoughts, and especially deadly at closer range. As each shell have a high velocity of 925 m/s, this results into good accuracy and thus make aiming easier.
