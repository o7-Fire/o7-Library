creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:39:48 yeah im currently working on the cockpit though plan to make it look as close as i feel like
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:42:20 heres the front view btw (also thanks gj)
creations-chat 2021-05-29 01:03:21 ehh that would require a whole rework of the nose though
creations-chat 2021-05-29 01:11:47 just posting another image of the wip mig-23m
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:14:01 <@787413783622582292> does it have the swing wing like the actual Su-17 or is it a fixed wing?


It gets easier as time goes on lmao
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:42:27 there is no such thing



also from what i can tell basically all the motorlocks are needed due to the way they built it
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:44:52 that is disgusting to look at

v true
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:47:35 true and also can we just talk about how insane the timer is for this chat

maybe give the paint some wear to it and or add more green colors
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:50:32 yesn't because of the fact you cant really go in another direction without other blocks

i do use both
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:55:12 that is a good point for what he could have done maybe even angle the grill

what i mean is from the side view the grill is seen being angled looking towards us
creations-chat 2021-07-30 04:58:34 first off damn that looks good as hell and <@!458012038594166795> please stop man i dont think having obc do obc brrrrt things is fun
creations-chat 2021-07-30 05:02:49 still good as hell ngl

ehh not really sure you could try using your green color and lightening it up with some spots of the normal one
creations-chat 2021-07-30 05:06:17 maybe you could try color codes like 75,95,75 like around there maybe?

you could try lightening up the cab color and giving it like 2-3 variants to it
creations-chat 2021-07-30 06:49:20 looks good enough for the truck
general 2021-07-30 16:23:23 hey so like

general 2021-07-30 16:24:06 Hot sauce, lemon juice, pepper+salt to cause true eye pain
general 2021-07-30 16:24:27 you rub it into your eyes and enjoy the salt water to clean your mouth
general 2021-07-30 16:24:57 he already did because of the glitches if you dont count camera blocks
general 2021-07-30 16:25:03 oh wait

general 2021-07-30 16:40:53 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
general 2021-07-30 16:41:40 i got an idea for those micro tanks that are a half block below the turret
general 2021-07-30 16:41:54 just use a piston with a distance to list the turret up a bit so no more random locking turret
general 2021-07-30 16:42:02 oof
creations-chat 2021-07-30 16:44:19 no i rate it no/10
creations-chat 2021-07-30 16:47:55 you asked for a rating dunno why you upset

general 2021-07-30 22:56:51 i agree
general 2021-07-30 22:57:10 nothing supersonic should be fighting things at 9.0 or lower
general 2021-07-30 22:57:59 Cl-13 Mk.6 is 9.7 with like a 20k repair i think not sure havent grinded all of germany
general 2021-07-30 22:58:47 yeah because gaijin as the iq of a room full of autistic babies
general 2021-07-30 22:59:11 gaijin for sure
general 2021-07-30 22:59:33 its better for one jet to suffer than whole BRs
general 2021-07-30 23:00:09 ehhh
general 2021-07-30 23:00:19 i dont really agree but then again i havent played those
general 2021-07-30 23:00:38 yeah
general 2021-07-30 23:00:59 but i mean at 9.7 it can fight 8.7
general 2021-07-30 23:01:51 true but its still not a good thing that what is essentially mid jets are fighting a supersonic zero
general 2021-07-30 23:02:12 im making a joke about it
general 2021-07-30 23:03:05 hey who wants to have a headache
general 2021-07-30 23:03:40 cause i remember someone saying that the F4F is still too high in BR at 10.3
general 2021-07-30 23:03:56 yes
general 2021-07-30 23:04:10 wanna know their logic
general 2021-07-30 23:04:20 because it doesnt get sparrows and has no flares.

general 2021-07-30 23:13:56 remember when they swapped the cockpit and third person for the vulcan
general 2021-07-30 23:14:35 i remember hearing something like it being changed at least from a video
general 2021-07-30 23:17:56 i find it funny how people are mad about someone getting HOF on mobile
general 2021-07-30 23:18:54 not sure

plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:21:10 fuck houses
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:21:13 too boring
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:21:15 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:21:17 which plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:21:45 Cold War-Modern day no airliners
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:22:21 *Preferably Military*
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:23:21 might try my hand at an AWACS
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:24:22 *I'm going to Dahmer your bones and use them to feed the growing palm trees in my backyard*
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:24:51 E-2 Hawkeye is a bit too sterotypical
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:25:14 counts as an airliner technically
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:25:19 P-8 Orion?
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:25:53 yeahh no
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:26:15 what the fuck did you just make me look at
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:26:39 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:26:43 mayb
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:27:54 A-3 seems 2 wide but i could try
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:28:01 S-3*
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:28:06 not A-3 need to check that rq
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 02:29:20 A-3 looks like a scuffed B-47 (if thats what its called)
general 2022-10-20 02:32:42 <:kek:652566605028524033> made it didnt use it until a while ago
general 2022-10-20 02:32:47 like recently that is
general 2022-10-20 02:33:48 F-15 in prob 1 1/2 years since we're getting more 4th gens soon
general 2022-10-20 02:38:24 gl
general 2022-10-20 02:38:28 BRH
general 2022-10-20 02:38:29 WHY
general 2022-10-20 02:38:36 WHY THE FUCK WOULD HE REFUND AN F-5C
general 2022-10-20 02:38:55 no theres a special word for that which i cant say here
general 2022-10-20 02:39:24 F-5C doesnt stall out in 3 turns at least <:kek:652566605028524033>
general 2022-10-20 02:39:49 also guns are easier to aim since they fly at vulcan speeds iirc and actually have tracers
general 2022-10-20 02:40:35 im being completely honest the F-5C is way better than the J35A especially with the Su-25 at 9.7
general 2022-10-20 02:41:25 okay so
general 2022-10-20 02:41:32 quaileer you play war thunder right
general 2022-10-20 02:41:41 its a premium that can help speed up the grind
general 2022-10-20 02:41:53 also AV-8A is mental pain dont buy it
source: i have it
general 2022-10-20 02:42:13 99% of all players can't fucking play the game at 9.3-10.3 cause they're dumb
general 2022-10-20 02:42:53 i fly the 104A so i cant fucking go 7km up or im fucked by a 2G missile
general 2022-10-20 02:43:08 very real
general 2022-10-20 02:43:33 so i use half burner 20m of fuel and fly mach 1.04 at like the deck to shit on Su-25s by flying from behind
general 2022-10-20 02:43:44 since im spaded <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-10-20 02:43:54 or sweats in general
general 2022-10-20 02:44:15 got fucking AIM-7F'd by an F-14 flying my LF Mk IX because he fucked up a turn trying to stafe me and died
general 2022-10-20 02:45:01 imma be honest aim-9B isnt *__that__* bad its still shit but workable
general 2022-10-20 02:45:32 aim-9D is dogshit and you cant change my mind
general 2022-10-20 02:45:42 i'd rather use an AA-20 Nord than a fucking 9D
general 2022-10-20 02:46:18 no shit thats just an uncaged 9B
general 2022-10-20 02:46:44 its got roughly the same seeker cone of a 9E with an 18G turn
general 2022-10-20 02:46:52 not that good imo
general 2022-10-20 02:47:18 also pro tip: dont fly the F86A-5 if you value your sanity
general 2022-10-20 02:47:44 wya in the US TT?
general 2022-10-20 02:47:54 like highest plane
general 2022-10-20 02:48:12 so 3.3?
general 2022-10-20 02:48:20 bruh
general 2022-10-20 02:48:30 fly RB mode it'll speed the grind up
general 2022-10-20 02:49:02 lowtier arcade gives me PTSD
general 2022-10-20 02:49:13 low tier france is doggy imo
general 2022-10-20 02:49:38 yeah
general 2022-10-20 02:49:47 H-75 is a glorified P-36 iirc
general 2022-10-20 02:49:58 MB 157 is decent i've heard
general 2022-10-20 02:50:06 even though its only got the 2 20mm iirc
general 2022-10-20 02:50:38 yeah gl getting the M2K w/o losing your sanity because of end game france
general 2022-10-20 02:51:07 Jaguar E seemed decent sadly couldnt get it cause Overpowered event was timed against me from school
general 2022-10-20 02:51:17 Germany is decent ngl
general 2022-10-20 02:51:35 Fw-190A-1 is gonna be a good idea to fly since it outspeeds even some 5.0s on the deck
general 2022-10-20 02:51:53 cause funny 550km/h IAS goes brrrrr
general 2022-10-20 02:52:10 MiG-15Bis
general 2022-10-20 02:52:16 Lim-5P
general 2022-10-20 02:52:27 heard the 23BN is dogshit
general 2022-10-20 02:52:40 don't remind me of the 15bis-ish being 8.3 when its slightly worse than a bis
general 2022-10-20 02:53:36 unfortunately yes

general 2022-10-24 11:32:22 like any of you all remember that shit
general 2022-10-24 11:32:51 give any HOF plane that is there now outlines and it'd look ugly
general 2022-10-24 11:34:02 eh i think it'd be good in build mode but past that nah
general 2022-10-24 11:35:45 some day we're gonna hit such high standards in <#384025409945337856> that its gonna collapse im betting on it

general 2022-10-24 11:52:34 ah
general 2022-10-24 11:52:53 could be good
general 2022-10-24 11:53:12 an S/VTOL runway up there makes the most sense
general 2022-10-24 11:53:41 helicopters have less military force though tbh
general 2022-10-24 11:54:01 but maybe a runway for STOLs and a section of pads for helis?
general 2022-10-24 11:57:44 and then flip over because brakes
general 2022-10-24 11:58:19 i mean technically using the airframe for a break is efficient

plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:22:35 that the one against motorlock?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:22:59 you're fucking stupid for hating motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:23:28 lets see
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:23:54 cmon lets see your flying boats
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:25:14 just dm me screenshots of them
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:25:35 yep

plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:27:18 ah alr
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:29:36 he doesnt have image perms yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:29:43 he needs to dm them
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:30:18 click on a profile either mine or <@932720290864193536> and press message then send the files

plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:17 honestly Smartcar you coulda made it look better if you used motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:31 w h y
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:33:58 it literally makes builds better
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:35:23 this is an example of what motorlock can help you do along with other locks most likely
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:40:59 faulty coding
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:41:25 my stupid ass thought that was glass wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:42:34 Consolidated PBY-4 Catalina will need motorlocking to make actually look good and accurate
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:44:30 still gonna need motorlock for this
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:45:09 frame, tail, and probably a lot more
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:46:00 its a 2 wide center with a thin cockpit on it
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:46:39 not to mention you might wanna make the wings thick
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:46:53 then its not the Martin M130
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:46:59 its a custom at that point
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 14:47:18 there is no middle line on it

general 2022-11-04 00:40:01 you could be like the 104 and have 2 9Bs
general 2022-11-04 00:40:23 not at 10.0
general 2022-11-04 00:40:27 8.3 sure
general 2022-11-04 00:40:45 dont matter only has a range of like 3km from top down at those altitudes
general 2022-11-04 00:41:37 spaded 104 is pretty fun

general 2022-11-04 00:43:49 fr
general 2022-11-04 00:43:58 F-5C is a lot better of a grinder than the Av8A

general 2022-11-30 18:17:16 also the rank 7s are like $70 so you'll save $30 by not buying 190C

plane-crazy 2022-12-31 22:32:32 speech-bubbled it

general 2023-01-10 15:39:42 Slovskii is kinda being "slow" right now
general 2023-01-10 15:40:24 i would like to say, I've not been discussing politics
general 2023-01-10 15:41:31 i would suggest getting a less cheap one as it'll be more reliable afaik
general 2023-01-10 15:41:44 you can buy exploding bbs
general 2023-01-10 15:42:48 airport guns my beloved
general 2023-01-10 15:43:24 still try to find one that's not too cheap
general 2023-01-10 15:43:37 itll probably be more durable
general 2023-01-10 15:43:53 
general 2023-01-10 15:44:07 user is Slovskii
general 2023-01-10 15:44:24 well shit

general 2023-01-11 13:17:07 iirc the yak 38 program started because of a soviet general saw the harrier at an air show thing
general 2023-01-11 13:17:40 also no it's the yak 141 not yak 38 that people say the f35b copied
general 2023-01-11 13:18:19 no.
general 2023-01-11 13:18:23 other way around
general 2023-01-11 13:23:07 tu144 is a copy of the concorde

general 2023-01-12 14:18:12 card games like that are banned at my school
general 2023-01-12 14:18:56 can't
general 2023-01-12 14:19:12 can't visit them
general 2023-01-12 14:19:40 nah just unable to visit them
general 2023-01-12 14:19:50 and they're probably not fans of it
general 2023-01-12 14:20:12 7 fucking minutes left üíÄ
general 2023-01-12 14:20:49 it's really not hard to have a conversation here if you're not being stupid
general 2023-01-12 14:21:30 expert let's you shitpost <#497142796961054721> a decent bit
general 2023-01-12 14:21:48 furries are kinda cool imo
general 2023-01-12 14:22:06 they're chill 95% of the time
general 2023-01-12 14:22:28 
general 2023-01-12 14:23:41 guess it depends on who it is
general 2023-01-12 14:25:59 L
general 2023-01-12 14:29:10 card game time bye
general 2023-01-12 14:51:20 yeah just give it like a week
general 2023-01-12 14:51:36 same thing for the marinefleiger
general 2023-01-12 14:52:01 it'll always be on sale so long as it's in circulation
general 2023-01-12 14:52:18 you realize
general 2023-01-12 14:52:39 it will probably still be high even after
general 2023-01-12 14:52:55 i think it'll be at a minimum of 50gjn
general 2023-01-12 14:53:24 it has hard kill aps correct?
general 2023-01-12 14:53:50 yeah it does i just forgot
general 2023-01-12 14:54:09 since it kills any atgm so long as it's facing the turret
general 2023-01-12 14:54:15 no not really
general 2023-01-12 14:54:41 hard kill aps will protect from helicopter atgms too iirc
general 2023-01-12 14:55:01 thermals are vital
general 2023-01-12 14:55:42 i could ask a server with people who have the 80um2
general 2023-01-12 14:56:14 i didn't do the event since i had school and didn't want to fuck my mental state more
general 2023-01-12 14:56:38 thermals help with long range spots yknow.
general 2023-01-12 14:56:49 don't they also ignore smoke or am i thinking of something else
general 2023-01-12 14:57:14 night maps, long range, enemy's hiding in vegetation
general 2023-01-12 14:57:43 its hard to spot enemy's hiding if you don't got thermals
general 2023-01-12 14:58:17 which most maps have
general 2023-01-12 14:59:11 either way, thermals are very useful at 9.0+ grb afaik
general 2023-01-12 14:59:23 no
general 2023-01-12 14:59:41 not really
general 2023-01-12 14:59:57 depends on the br
general 2023-01-12 15:00:26 the battle rating eg the number (5.3, 1.7, 11.7)
general 2023-01-12 15:00:46 oh
general 2023-01-12 15:00:48 that's a good plane
general 2023-01-12 15:00:57 yak-1/1b is very good
general 2023-01-12 15:01:22 for props try to get altitude and know your planes
general 2023-01-12 15:01:41 it's more energy than dogfighting
general 2023-01-12 15:02:01 the Abrams with his silver bullet loaded:
general 2023-01-12 15:02:51 he means the specialty
general 2023-01-12 15:03:01 yak-1 is more of an energy fighter
general 2023-01-12 15:03:20 something like an a6m is more of a turn fighter
general 2023-01-12 15:04:39 <@656426683267809320> if you want to know a decent bit of playing the game try looking for shunting like defyn and his war thunder teaching videos they'll help a decent bit
general 2023-01-12 15:04:51 yeah its also called the silver bullet
general 2023-01-12 15:05:19 rip
general 2023-01-12 15:06:32 also the Russian tanks like t80um2 will be getting ammo racked fairly often if I'm not mistaken
general 2023-01-12 15:07:44 oh yeah
general 2023-01-12 15:07:57 we don't talk about that
general 2023-01-12 15:09:37 grb has all but naval in it
general 2023-01-12 15:09:50 you will be dealing with American cas
general 2023-01-12 15:09:56 and helicopters
general 2023-01-12 15:10:08 i can
general 2023-01-12 15:10:23 its called, flank and shoot center mass
general 2023-01-12 15:10:30 and boom
general 2023-01-12 15:10:56 cool you just get shot from the side of your breach
general 2023-01-12 15:11:20 they kinda are though
general 2023-01-12 15:11:46 how about you explain your side of the argument
general 2023-01-12 15:12:07 we kinda are since we're taking about war thunder grb afaik
general 2023-01-12 15:12:26 how thick is their armor and what spot?
general 2023-01-12 15:13:39 also, iirc t80 series has a mediocre apfsds round
general 2023-01-12 15:14:22 yes
general 2023-01-12 15:14:42 but you can also get killed by your common enemy's at that br from the front
general 2023-01-12 15:15:38 it's because it was an event vehicle
general 2023-01-12 15:15:42 they just got it
general 2023-01-12 15:15:49 so they're going to use it
general 2023-01-12 15:16:37 also by the logic of,  'everyone uses it so it's meta' then let's use that on the tornado, is it meta?
general 2023-01-12 15:17:46 you are talking on the t80um2 which is also new
general 2023-01-12 15:18:06 either way.
general 2023-01-12 15:18:19 it's almost like it's the most abundant and numbers matter!
general 2023-01-12 15:19:03 yknow what.
general 2023-01-12 15:19:15 go tell me how your experience with it is
general 2023-01-12 15:19:19 when you get it
general 2023-01-12 15:19:40 then go play the t80 series to prove me wrong
general 2023-01-12 15:19:50 yes but this is 10.7+
general 2023-01-12 15:20:04 it is.
general 2023-01-12 15:20:15 1.7 br higher and you lack a very major thing
general 2023-01-12 15:22:43 you can't really base wr on how good a nation is
general 2023-01-12 15:23:18 want me to pull out an example with air rb?
general 2023-01-12 15:23:32 still
general 2023-01-12 15:23:46 i don't play grb but still argued
general 2023-01-12 15:24:08 let's take the F-16 MLU which is in the Chinese tree
general 2023-01-12 15:24:23 it's arguably the best f16 in game rn
general 2023-01-12 15:24:37 yet has a 30%~ wr
general 2023-01-12 15:24:42 wanna guess why?
general 2023-01-12 15:25:07 no
general 2023-01-12 15:25:15 because the teams are full of idiots
general 2023-01-12 15:25:31 which artificially inflates the wr of the enemy players team
general 2023-01-12 15:26:55 but he can still use it
general 2023-01-12 15:27:59 i merely brought Chinese Air into here as an example as to why you can't base wr off of meta-ness
general 2023-01-12 15:28:15 Chinese Air wr is just generally shit rn
general 2023-01-12 15:28:35 F-16 ADF, F-16A, F-14A Early,  F-4J
general 2023-01-12 15:28:48 those are all good planes
general 2023-01-12 15:29:09 F-4J is the worst out of those 4 some would argue
general 2023-01-12 15:29:14 but it is still good
general 2023-01-12 15:29:34 and also
general 2023-01-12 15:29:41 they're very good combined
general 2023-01-12 15:30:05 an F-16A/ADF on your 6 with an F-14A as well is just death 90% of the time
general 2023-01-12 15:31:40 so now
general 2023-01-12 15:32:16 explain to me how they don't have a single good plane in the US Air TT at top tier <@1029091633037328404>
general 2023-01-12 15:34:36 "das mad" is discriminatory?
general 2023-01-12 15:34:53 also why are you using roblox light mode
general 2023-01-12 15:36:04 then change it in your settings man
general 2023-01-12 15:36:11 afaik this is saying "us top tier doesn't have a single good plane"
general 2023-01-12 15:36:35 ü§ì
general 2023-01-12 15:37:41 and if this is actually for Chinese Air, they do have more than one good plane, J7E, (j8b is meh) but they also got the f5e which is still good
general 2023-01-12 15:39:03 they don't though
general 2023-01-12 15:39:39 China has more than one good plane now dude
general 2023-01-12 15:40:17 they have the j7e which gets 4 pl5bs which are some of the best strictly ir missiles
general 2023-01-12 15:43:56 war thunder
general 2023-01-12 15:44:31 want something else other than war thunder in here?
general 2023-01-12 15:48:37

general 2023-02-13 23:33:13 how so.
general 2023-02-13 23:33:36 those are just as bad.
general 2023-02-13 23:34:01 that's fine but they should've just been a fucking double wedge block not a weapon
general 2023-02-13 23:35:43 Chiseled can you make one promise
general 2023-02-13 23:35:58 never add shredders please.
general 2023-02-13 23:36:38 just make it be a double wedge if you need to add it in
