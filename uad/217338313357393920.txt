plane-crazy 2019-06-19 12:06:49 I do not have access to this magical land known as colours
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 13:28:10 Where do I post suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 13:29:42 oh alright, thanks
bot-central 2019-06-19 13:32:33 Oh for fuck sake
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 13:38:35 oooh
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 14:27:41 *dab*
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 14:27:43 so far so good on my Grumman
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:10:23 Grumman J2F Duck coastguard plane (I cant wait to try and get this off the ground...)
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:41:21 Its slowly being butchered as I try to make it fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 15:41:32 I can make really nice planes but I hate how underpowered everything is
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:52:17 You can barely see the plane
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:54:43 shut up you smell
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:01 How is this downvote worthy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:27 FUCK I DIDNT MEAN TO DO THAT
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:32 huge planes are annoying to get off the ground
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:47 the entire point of that hurricane was a test of how small I could make a nice and functional plane
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:51 and it flies like a beast
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:30 Its not bad it just looks British
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:08 You dont need to fit massive amounts of detail such as a camo pattern if the plane actually looks how its meant to
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:59 My Grumman Duck is about 290 parts and its like trying to make a 50 tonne block of lead fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:24 exactly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:47 My Hawker is like 120 parts and I fucking struggled to get that off the ground too
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:54 On each of my planes I end up hiding like 5 jets
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:19 *Look at all those rockets*
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:45 I dont like using rockets because they leave a particle trail, have a bad noise, and end up being too heavy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:07 I have a P38 Lightning with 137 parts, it has two propellors, like 6 jets, and helium too, and it doesnt fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:29 I have a Hurricane with 110 parts, 1 propeller, 3 jets, 1 thing of helium, and it flies amazingly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:38 what is the logic
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:03:45 and the P38 has like double the control surfaces
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:13 You havent even seen the aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:28 I love the game too but everything is so underpowered
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:36 it takes like 20 jets to carry 50 parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:52 and you need about 10x the original amount of control surfaces too
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:19 otherwise it has the response time of an arthritic 100 year old tortoise
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:35 Because majority of the community make small builds
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:46 not everyone likes making 500+ part huge things
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:54 when small things fly well, look nice, and are quick to make
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:21 Just because you cant make small things or have seen many good small things doesnt mean every small thing is ugly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:55 You got offended quickly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 so yes
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 Well you're yet to show us one of your 'good small things' and you constantly keep dissing small builds and downvoting them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:28 I assume you cant
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:47 size doesnt matter as long as you know how to use it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:58 I dont give a shit about challenges
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:08 Im about to go eat and I play the game for fun
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:16 I make small things because I like making small things
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:43 they look satisfying and they fly well and im not amazing at getting things off the ground because I hate rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:17 the game's weight system confuses me and everything is horrendously underpowered
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:18 so
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:39 I dont like them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:49 theyre too powerful and make a god awful noise and the particles are bad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:19 Not everyone likes coating their planes in layers of ugly jets, I try to make my planes look nice and function
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:46 Also its not beautiful but I achieved a thing that looks somewhat nice and looks like a Grumman Duck
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:51 
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:01 MEAN
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:01 I DIDNT

creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:27:12 Ive had my account at 13+ since like the second I figured out what safechat was in 2013
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:27:28 thats what my brother told me too
creations-chat 2019-06-19 19:36:46 No its to make them spin faster and produce more speed
creations-chat 2019-06-19 19:36:51 I dont personally like it but it works
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:08:20 Hybrid I-16/MiG interceptor
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:10 Just the sort of central engine idea of the MiG in general
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:32 It started out as a normal I-16
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:45 but then it had bad turning so I added the rear
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:12:57 then it was slow so I added more engines instead of a prop
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:17 and so on
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:19 and thus
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:13:52 the IA-167 was born
help 2019-06-20 00:21:41 el chompo and joseph turtil
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:22:04 Im still having lift problems
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:22:56 nvm i fixed it
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:23:40 just needed moar speed
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:23:44 *i am sped*
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:36:05 James why do you downvote everything that like isnt yours
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:46:51 Just because its simple didnt mean effort didnt go into it
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:46:59 I actually try on my planes to make them look nice
creations-chat 2019-06-20 12:09:09 How do you make extremely long carriers
creations-chat 2019-06-20 12:09:15 I get folding and stuff but like
creations-chat 2019-06-20 12:09:19 the *mega* long ones
creations-chat 2019-06-20 12:11:53 I mean that IJN Hosho one further up
creations-chat 2019-06-20 18:26:55 big ol doot
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:29:19 I cant suggest stuff but imagine an engine block that was like 1x2 and had like 10x the power of a motor so a plane could be sustained by a propeller and not need like 100 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:30:45 ;v
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:30:49 gimme a second
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:33:45 ;v
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:33:56 I changed my props but now it just flips over to the right
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:34:57 Decid this doesnt work at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:35:15 the propeller
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:35:34 Its like a fucking rotary engine on steroids
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:35:41 it just immediately flips me over to the right
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:36:27 forces the plane to the right and when I get lift it flips
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:36:35 Stuka, but most my planes are prop planes
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:36:45 
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:37:35 What torq should I use for it? I always set it to max since otherwise it barely gets speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:38:34 I have a Grumman Duck, Stuka, I-16, Hawker Hurricane, and a Gyrocopter
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:38:37 all prop vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:39:01 Im trying to find a fix for my prop planes not flex
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:39:16 they arent even good according to *some people* because they arent big
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:41:13 If I lower the speed I might as well not use it because it wont give any lift
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:43:03 https://i.gyazo.com/5943cd70f6c92d0e9da8b5a6c90eefb6.mp4
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:43:16 I know my cursor goes right at the start but that isnt me making it turn
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:43:21 it pretty much doesnt respond to turning now
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:44:26 it flips when its on max torque, that was when it was set to 0.1
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:49:16 I get about 100-110 speed now
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:49:18 except no lift
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:49:19 at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:50:17 I hate rockets and super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:50:26 the fastest I have is my I-16 interceptor
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:50:33 and its like covered in jets and rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:50:58 because theres no space
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:51:35 
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:51:51 It looks bad, I know, I preferred it as a normal I-16
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:52:01 but this is just so it can fucking go over 80 and actually get lift
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:52:50 Why not buff jets, whats the point in them even existing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:53:25 I'd rather not use either but propellers are too weak to sustain even a small plane like an I-16 in flight
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:54:02 Because I dont like the particles
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:54:38 Im gonna convert this back into a regular I-16
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:55:31 I dont like big planes either because its even more effort to make them fly
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 18:55:33 >;c

creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:05:52 Boeing P26A Peashooter with folding wings because why the hecc not
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:05:56 When folded
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:06:02 
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:06:19 Wings drop down, fold under the plane's belly... ideal for carriers I guess
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:25:46 Turns out putting the wings forward makes you turn really fast and putting them back at an angle makes you go down really quick
creations-chat 2019-06-25 00:26:01 and having your wings forward reduces amount of runway needed
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 00:38:21

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:23:07 Can someone suggest cannons for me
2 blocks long unlike the 1 for gun (entire 2 blocks, not sat in the middle)
5x as powerful as gun
Has ammo
Twice as heavy
Limited to like 4 or something instead of 12 like the guns
Beefy pew sound
like 2 second intervals between each shot, but still automatic, like the gun.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:23:42 Idk how to suggest even if I can suggest
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:24:08 In which channel
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:24:10 bot?
bot-central 2019-08-16 19:25:30 &suggest ***Cannons*** - People underestimate the use of cannons but lets face it nearly ever WW2 plane and beyond has them
2 blocks long unlike the 1 for gun (entire 2 blocks, not sat in the middle)
5x as powerful as gun
Has ammo
Twice as heavy
Limited to like 4 or something instead of 12 like the guns
Beefy pew sound

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 19:52:55 Im British and honestly I dont care about the 2nd Amendment and all that shit I just think there should be laws that require guns to be stored in safe places, and have the families of gun owners and the owner themselves get checked every now and again ;v
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 19:53:34 Gun shop owners do a good job by themselves since they have the power to deny any sale and report it to the police but that doesnt stop shit from happening after the purchase
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 19:55:42 same with Britain tbh, all it takes is for someone to think
"I best take a knife incase someone else has a knife"
and then for other people to think the same thing
and all of a sudden like 50% of the kids outside are armed
and then all it takes is a fight or some verbal abuse and they think "hang on a second, I have the knife and he doesnt" and they use it.

plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:45:43 That waterline might as well not exist
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:45:44 because
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:45:52 this thing floats about as well as the HMS Hood
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:46:42 when in service the HMS Hood was nicknamed the "Royal Navy's Swimming Pool" because she was so heavy that her stern would be fully submerged at full load
general 2020-01-03 03:47:12 sad noises
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:15 ok so basically
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:17 https://gyazo.com/77c376db9915393c28008537fe977bbc
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:24 pink is the intended waterline
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:27 yellow is the actual
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:51 im gonna have to
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:48:58 it flips because the funnels make it off balanced
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 03:51:35 Its almost 4am and im sat here making a fucking self-flipping runway
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:02:08 https://gyazo.com/6e8f17e864c449eac6ef5978a2fae765
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:02:11 stopping boards
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:02:15 for when you come in too fast
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:02:21 you get to face plant two fucking boards
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:06:18 lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:18:48 ok no need to flex
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:24:18 Is that a working catapult?
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:24:38 please share this alien technology with me
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:32:53 As the carrier stands
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:32:55 its at
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:33:01 3089 bricks
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:33:23 I also decided to name it the HMC Gibraltar
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:33:38 because on my most recent HOI game I made the Gibraltan empire
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:36 xook designed the hull
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:39 therefore
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:42 is the biggest loser
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:12 ❤️
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:29 LOOK OK IF YOU SAW THE FUCKING SUPERSTRUCTURE ON THAT THING YOU'D MAKE A CARRIER TOO
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:38 I almost had an aneurism
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:20 We made a fleet of monitors but we only  ever finished the hulls, xook finished the superstructure but I made a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:44 I did base it off the USS Langley which was literally the first US carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:51 1923
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:39:53 I think
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:40:04 bro
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:40:50 https://gyazo.com/ab048c55a7f5bc4c737e1a31ca736bec
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:41:13 yeah I had to make my own stern because of how we sort of
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:41:15 branched off
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:41:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:41:35 Matrx has a sort of 50% done monitor hull
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:41:56 Funny part is I kept the torpedo buldges lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:42:00 yes vixo
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:42:03 we were making a fleet
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:42:07 we all made the same hull
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:42:13 except I was lazy and converted mine into a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:42:44 realistically there should be 4 monitors if 2 didnt give up and I didnt make a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:43:57 so uh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:44:07 thats how the HMC Gibraltar was born
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:44:34 ill finish it tomorrow and slap it in creations because who doesnt love a good old carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:45:59 so my carrier is 3k parts
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:46:03 xook's monitor is 4k
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:46:21 my Gotland class submarine with fitted armaments is fucking 750 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:47:00 yes but thats assuming you set out to make a carrier and not something else
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:47:21 mini graf
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:47:57 ill still never forget the day I somehow managed to get a missile inside the graf and yeet it to bits like a citadel explosion
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:48:26 I think im gonna crawl into bed now
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:48:35 brb a sec whilst I transition to phone
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 14:09:28 I am determined to one day make this float at it's actual fucking waterline
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 14:09:31 at this point
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 14:09:42 I might as well put some landing craft or a hovercraft on the reserve deck

help 2020-01-09 15:19:09 Can someone help me make a compact magnetic engine for a torpedo?
help 2020-01-09 15:23:25 christ ok, I asked for help because I asked someone else and the way they described it sounded like a 5x5 multiblock structure or something and I just thought "wtf, I've seen people do tiny ones before"
help 2020-01-09 15:23:37 thanks
help 2020-01-09 15:24:41 inb4 revolver torpedoes

help 2020-01-09 15:33:21 <@!232694074501496833> Apart from keybinds what other settings should I do?
help 2020-01-09 15:56:46 uh
help 2020-01-09 15:57:05 this magnet engine is very temperamental
help 2020-01-09 15:57:17 Sometimes it works and sometimes it flings its platform away and sits there
creations-chat 2020-01-09 16:42:46 I thought that at first
creations-chat 2020-01-09 16:42:48 but no
creations-chat 2020-01-09 16:42:50 its pretty cool
general 2020-01-09 16:43:21 I..
general 2020-01-09 16:43:22 what
general 2020-01-09 16:43:29 you measure your height in metres not centimetres the fuck?
general 2020-01-09 16:43:57 Yes its metric but who the fuck uses centimetres?
general 2020-01-09 16:44:32 exactly
general 2020-01-09 16:44:51 I'm 1.85m tall but it is so much easier to just say 6'1
general 2020-01-09 16:45:38 ;v
general 2020-01-09 16:45:46 *gets ruler from table next to me*
general 2020-01-09 16:46:07 2.35cm
general 2020-01-09 16:46:08 roughly
general 2020-01-09 16:46:21 e
general 2020-01-09 16:46:34 ***e***
general 2020-01-09 16:46:39 well google is wrong
general 2020-01-09 16:47:18 or not because my ruler is genuinely fucked
general 2020-01-09 16:47:32 the inches side starts like 3mm ahead of the cm side
general 2020-01-09 16:47:34 so yes
general 2020-01-09 16:47:39 its about 2.5cm ish
general 2020-01-09 20:09:20 bruh there is more than enough space for an autoloader in there
general 2020-01-09 20:09:29 it probably goes by the same concept of a naval autoloader
general 2020-01-09 20:09:39 the shells arent directly behind the gun, they get lifted up
general 2020-01-09 20:09:59 all it needs room for is the gun itself and two automated arms for loading the shell ;v
general 2020-01-09 20:10:16 Oh fuck whats it called
general 2020-01-09 20:10:18 JORDAN
general 2020-01-09 20:10:20 thats it
general 2020-01-09 20:10:40 Jordan bought all the British army's old Challenger 1s, made the turret thin as fucc and installed an autoloader
general 2020-01-09 20:12:06 Lmao im retarded
general 2020-01-09 20:12:08 that picture
general 2020-01-09 20:12:15 is literally a Jordanian Challenger 1
general 2020-01-09 20:12:35

creations-chat 2020-01-09 20:14:05 even the wheels are green
creations-chat 2020-01-09 20:14:06 its bad
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:14:46 'if it looks good it looks good' I mean
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:14:49 the problem here is
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:14:51 it doesnt look good
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:14:54 quite the opposite even
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:11 ooooo
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:15 he gonna get boned
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:31 HAH
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:34 okay he did it now
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:37 oooooof
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:16:56 I think he deserves a bit more than a warn at this point
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:19:19 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:19:30 I tried it on my IL-2
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:19:43 Ban his id
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:19:44 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:02 Okay so I know how to make a very basic magnetic engine
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:06 but im gonna make an interceptor
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:10 and I need something more beefy
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:23 Anyone know how to make powerful magnetic engines?
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:37 sad noises
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:41 I always wanted a 1x1 prop
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:21:48 especially for putting coloured tips on my propellors
plane-crazy 2020-01-09 20:22:00 Idk how to do conveyor engines ;v
general 2020-01-09 20:23:14 Because its an autoloader lol
general 2020-01-09 20:23:22 and it has composite armour coming out the ass
general 2020-01-09 20:23:48 Normally on most autoloaders I've seen they have a sort of semi-sphere disc shape around them to deflect shells
the-dump 2020-01-09 20:31:40 yeah I use depths of the abyss mode
help 2020-01-09 20:45:42 how 2 mek conveyor engine ;c

plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:05:35 custom Mig21
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:05:40 and it flies amazingly
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:05:42 https://gyazo.com/2cdce1a0882a2c76b970f21431a413bb
creations-chat 2020-01-10 00:10:48 Custom cold war mini jet I made based off the Mig-21 to add to my collection- and yes before you downvote it because you dont like 'low effort small builds' I made it small intentionally.
creations-chat 2020-01-10 00:10:56 
creations-chat 2020-01-10 00:11:09 Under belly torpedo/bomb mount because why not
creations-chat 2020-01-10 00:12:18 It has a parachute for carrier landings, snow blaster for the trail effect, all 3 axis turning with custom flaps, a V6 Magnetic drive engine and a nose firework cannon for strafing
creations-chat 2020-01-10 00:13:36 (better angle on the mount per request)
help 2020-01-10 00:14:13 Just google Marchel Nay monitor
help 2020-01-10 00:14:16 it was very tall
help 2020-01-10 00:14:24 its actually cool because xook did the entire turret ring interior
general 2020-01-10 00:16:35 mmmmmmmmmmm
general 2020-01-10 00:16:40 smol issue with my V6
general 2020-01-10 00:17:02 By itself, the engine goes about 450 speed
general 2020-01-10 00:17:13 When in my plane
general 2020-01-10 00:17:16 it goes 160ish
general 2020-01-10 00:17:19 170 pushing
general 2020-01-10 00:19:28 I know 170 is bad and I know 450 is gay, I want it around 300ish
general 2020-01-10 00:19:50 Idk why it suddenly dropped off I mean the plane isnt even big
general 2020-01-10 00:19:56 178 parts
general 2020-01-10 00:20:57 any idea how to make this better without literally making a V12?
general 2020-01-10 00:20:59 
general 2020-01-10 00:21:30 "stop resisting and let me spread peace and prosperity"
general 2020-01-10 00:21:36 "I SAID STOP RESISTING"
general 2020-01-10 00:21:59 fuck it
general 2020-01-10 00:22:02 V12 time
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:32:57 <@456226577798135808> why u dislike my mig ;c
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:33:18 If you have genuine criticism im open to hearing it because I know it can be improved
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:33:39 also like
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:33:43 I know this is during turning
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:33:49 but I got it to about 300 going flat
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:33:50 https://gyazo.com/dc01ba212133f98c2062da38c1da621c
general 2020-01-10 00:36:11 Does anyone have any tips on how to make magnetic drive engines more efficient?
general 2020-01-10 00:36:53 Idk how to make conveyor drives so..
general 2020-01-10 00:38:00 this is what I use to power my MiG, V12 Magnetic drive
general 2020-01-10 00:38:54 IP tracker?
general 2020-01-10 00:39:12 no one trusts you
general 2020-01-10 00:39:40 Mytha do you know how to make conveyor drives?
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:50:18 Its hard to get a good angle but here, just for you
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:50:28 
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:51:38 I mean small and detail dont really go together in plane crazy so I tried my best to make it look remotely nice and mig-ish
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:51:51 Custom mig I made based off a MiG-21
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:52:06 Its small for carriers
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:52:45 Parasite fighters
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:53:13 google the XF-85 McDonnel Goblin
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:16 I originally started building the XF-85 but I couldnt get the shape right
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:18 so I thought
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:26 "Ive been wanting to do a mig for a while now"
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:28 so why the f not
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:35 oh thats cool
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:54:48 Figors
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:55:07 Because its a small plane I couldnt do the iconic mig in take properly
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:55:16 so I compensated with a cone nose and an under-nose intake
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:55:35 To be fair MiGs still have a cone nose just the intake is around it
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:56:15 
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:56:39 wbic
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 00:56:41 ebic
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:02:32 My PT boat goes like 80sps so..
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:03:45 Average PT boat probably goes faster than 80, mine is a thicc ass boi fully kitted out with 2 bofors, 4 torpedoes and a life boat
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:11:47 real micro fighter hours
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:13:52 2/10 would not recommend unless you want a plane so unstable you feel sick
the-dump 2020-01-10 01:23:35 Obama
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:36:35 Conveyors are fun but I've found magnets to be much more stable
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:36:39 the speed was nice but
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 01:36:45 it pretty much breaks the plane
general 2020-01-10 02:54:28 lmao look at this noob
general 2020-01-10 02:56:07 w
general 2020-01-10 02:56:10 thanks
general 2020-01-10 02:56:14 appreciate it
general 2020-01-10 02:56:28 verbal warnings exist but y'know
general 2020-01-10 02:57:04 ^
general 2020-01-10 02:58:01 I literally just opened discord and posted it because the guy was being an idiot, I saw no verbal warnings or past conversations
general 2020-01-10 02:58:03 and I get warned
general 2020-01-10 02:58:10 thank you
general 2020-01-10 02:58:40 what
general 2020-01-10 02:58:52 im sorry for being in a discord with hundreds of people in it
general 2020-01-10 02:59:17 Obc, verbal warnings only work when people see them
general 2020-01-10 03:00:03 I wasnt aware there was a strict rule foreboding anything game related in a game based community discord
general 2020-01-10 03:00:06 I hopped in
general 2020-01-10 03:00:08 dropped the photo
general 2020-01-10 03:00:11 and went back in game
general 2020-01-10 03:00:13 and I got warned
general 2020-01-10 03:00:44 I know plane crazy exists but this channel also exists
general 2020-01-10 03:00:49 well why is it called general
general 2020-01-10 03:00:52 and not something else
general 2020-01-10 03:01:09 I dont know what happened later I literally just freaking dropped in
general 2020-01-10 03:01:10 jesus christ
general 2020-01-10 03:01:58 obc theres a law in England which makes looking suspicious with a salmon in public illegal but you dont see people getting arrested for it without warning
general 2020-01-10 03:03:11 My point was, its an obscure and confusing rule. I never saw the verbal warning and I didnt read the full channel name. It was a misunderstanding. I didnt go into the discord and think "HMMM WHAT RULE CAN I BREAK TODAY"
general 2020-01-10 03:03:36 Oh my god its just a circle with you isnt it
general 2020-01-10 03:03:55 THEN WHY WAS I WARNED FOR IT
general 2020-01-10 03:03:57 oh my god
general 2020-01-10 03:04:21 Im about to face desk so hard that i'll bleed
general 2020-01-10 03:04:47 im gonna have an aneurism I swear
general 2020-01-10 03:05:06 correction, you *were* actively telling people
general 2020-01-10 03:05:10 I was just unlucky
general 2020-01-10 03:05:12 and dropped in
general 2020-01-10 03:05:26 no u
general 2020-01-10 03:06:02 brand new obscure rule regarding a minor infraction which apparently warrants a warning.. ok
general 2020-01-10 03:06:17 it wasnt very verbal
general 2020-01-10 03:06:26 How
general 2020-01-10 03:06:35 out of all the people you did speak to sure, but I literally dropped in
general 2020-01-10 03:06:51 Its pretty effortless at this point
