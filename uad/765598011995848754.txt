plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:12:56 has anyone been having the same problem with their motor 2's?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:15:55 say something mildly original
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:31 yep
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:40 it only happens with servo motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:48 from what I see
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:16:53 and it happens at random
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:02 my gunship doesn't have the same problem
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:17:36 it happens at random
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:18:08 he said landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:19:13 my gunship only has 2 or 3 servo motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:19:22 thats probably why it isn't broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:19:39 I think the bug only happens when your build has too many servo motors
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:11 all my builds have max torque
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:19 ill check
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:27 my gunship still works
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:20:45 oh wait it has low torque
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:22:02 even with low torque my jet is still having massive internal bleeding
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:02 im just gonna hope that rick fixes the problem
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:20 typical german overengineering
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:23:49 just slap a motor 2 with servo
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:24:36 motor 2 with servo can be used for better precision
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:25:35 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:26:26 why does rick expect to be able to work on the game all by himself yet shit like this happens?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:27:10 he could hire a few devs
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:27:57 yeah it is
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:28:27 I've seen people make shitty sonic ripoffs and come out with like 50k
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:29:09 a game like plane crazy makes thousands every month
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:29:28 I mean 3 thousand active players is nothing to scoff at
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:30:11 there are so many ways it could be more profitable
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:30:22 without ruining the core concept
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:30:56 I said without ruining the core concept
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:31:24 something like extra blocks that come with a gamepass
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:32:01 like a torpedo
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:32:26 or different angled wedges
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:33:19 how else would they be sold?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:34:02 the only actual competitor for plane crazy that I see is flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:34:11 babft is dogshit
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:34:47 you have to grind for days for simple building tools
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:35:13 yeah that could work
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:35:31 different angled wedges wouldn't be pay to win
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:35:40 since you can use motorlock to get them
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:36:19 not just 1 or 2, im talking like a few dozen
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:36:37 true
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:37:16 also some thing else that would be nice changing the build mode hitboxes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:37:29 why are they rectangles and squares?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:37:58 why is it so hard to make hitboxes the shape of the building block?
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:38:10 that should be the number 1 change in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:38:30 no the building hitbox
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:38:47 like you can't join two wedges together to form a square
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:38:52 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:39:17 I still don't understand why madattack hardcoded everything in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:41:06 I mean wouldn't it be just better if the fake square hitbox was removed
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:41:28 motorlock would still be useful
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:44:09 shut up
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 01:44:27 yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:16:09 this

general 2023-03-16 02:51:52 what?
general 2023-03-16 02:52:03 they are broken, aren't they?
general 2023-03-16 02:52:20 I think they have a good reason to complain
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:54:12 <@443852405906341888>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:54:50 yep
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:55:00 not just servo that is broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:55:10 motor 2's in general are broken
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:10 bro uses hover thrusters to turn
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:56:47 a lot of people use motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:57:20 the people who don't use motor 2's are psychopaths
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:57:34 like <@443852405906341888>
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:06 ok give a hint to what you use
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:58:40 95% of the playerbase uses motor 2's one way or another
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:59:03 the other 4.9% is brand new players
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 02:59:49 what do they use

plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:02:45 oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:02:49 maybe
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:03 I have one build that uses it
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:07 but its really old
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:03:29 it does it does
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:04:03 like I said its broken but i'm not sure what the issue is
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:04:15 I haven't loaded it in
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:04:18 in a while
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:08:39 I just checked with a newer build
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:08:57 motor 2 mouse glitch still works
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:10:15 when I said newer build, I meant I just placed a motor 2 and did the glitch
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:10:34 so uhh
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:10:47 once you get home you might want to check
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:13:35 basically it allows you to control motor 2 without being in a pilot seat
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 03:14:19 it involves a propellor
