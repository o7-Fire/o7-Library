general 2023-01-20 06:36:51 Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is actually NOT the most huggable pokemon? This is a common misconception, with the real most huggable pokemon being Sylveon, of course! A Sylveon is not only a great companion to cuddle and spend time with, but is also an expert at emotional support. They can use their ribbon-like feelers to read your emotions and therefore can know whenever you're sad, angry, lonely, etc, resulting in it always knowing exactly what's wrong without even needing to ask, helping it cheer you up accordingly. Since it evolved from its love for you, a Sylveon would probably be more affectionate than any other Eeveelution would be, allowing for prolonged sessions of cuddling or hugging to help cheer you up. Due to evolving from love, you can safely assume that it would have incredibly soft fur for cuddling or hugging. A Sylveon also has an impressive Special Defense stat of 130, meaning they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. As a result of this, whenever you feel stressed out for any reason, or simply want someone to talk to, you can vent to it while hugging or cuddling, and it won't mind. Not only this, but Sylveon can also learn Calm Mind by TR, which can not only raise its special defense, but also get rid of any stress caused by venting to it. They can also learn and use moves such as Charm and Baby-Doll Eyes to make itself even more endearing. Let's not forget that Sylveon can also release a soothing aura from its feelers to calm you down, helping you deal with any anger or frustration you could ever face. Not only did Sylveon evolve because it loves you, it evolved because you love it, so it's safe to say even seeing your beloved Sylveon would cause a dopamine rush.
general 2023-01-20 06:36:53 As an added bonus, if you like going on walks, your Sylveon will wrap its feelers around your arm and walk with you. Sylveon are also known to battle against dragon pokemon many times larger than itself, so not only will your Sylveon provide amazing emotional support, your Sylveon will also defend you from any threat, should the time ever come that it would be required to.
