general 2023-04-07 16:01:45 a fold is when you bring pieces together right

general 2023-04-09 05:26:46 thats a beam link
general 2023-04-09 05:26:52 ro.blox 💀
general 2023-04-09 05:27:44 it's literally a beam link
general 2023-04-09 05:27:51 if it asks you to log in don't
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:28:15 <@636996526878490624> i did smart guy

general 2023-04-09 05:29:01 no
general 2023-04-09 05:29:09 thats not how beam links work
general 2023-04-09 05:29:15 they look like the actual page
general 2023-04-09 05:29:23 and tell you you're not logged in
general 2023-04-09 05:29:39 then you log in and provide a 2fa code
general 2023-04-09 05:30:45 they give the beamer your IP, account value, parental pin, 2fa codes, and password
general 2023-04-09 05:31:32 did you log in on the link
general 2023-04-09 05:31:37 if you did just change your password
general 2023-04-09 05:31:50 it changes your cookie and then they can't get into your account
general 2023-04-09 05:32:21 if you didn't log in on the link, even if it is a beam link, they probably don't have your cookie
general 2023-04-09 05:32:44 who is amikari
general 2023-04-09 05:34:31 yeah man for sure!

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:07:22 Jk
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:07:27 I’m off my pc so I can’t show you
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:07:39 But I did need motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:08:11 The deck is a half block below and then the other stuff is above
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:08:18 And I had to layer a bunch of the wedges
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:08:27 So therefore I needed the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:08:35 It’s very minimal though
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:09:44 Put bombs inside of the tower
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:09:53 So it can’t break
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:09:59 🤣
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:12:34 Then balance it again with balast blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:13:06 Yeah man!
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:16:36 Shredders are garbage idk why people hate them so much

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:17:43 Whats the difference between legacy and non legacy missiles
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:18:10 Lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:20:30 Okay nerd
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:20:52 Why is tracking so ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:21:02 Is it because I go too fast or because it’s just ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:21:23 I have 4 missiles bound to 1 and 4 to 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:21:27 Each has different settings
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:21:56 Legacy tracking, normal tracking, normal, legacy
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:06 Yeah but it flies around and misses
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:11 When it would have hit
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:15 Had it not spazzed out
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:31 Might as well
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:34 Sometimes it helps
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:22:46 OKAY NERD
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:23:14 I’ve never tried
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:23:23 Is it just a bomb plane basically
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:23:29 With a camera I assume
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:24:01 Then what is it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:24:38 I made a couple planes but they’re all ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:24:50 I’ll learn how to make a proper jet
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:24:54 After I finish the boat
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:28:17 Can you control it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:28:24 Or is it just a rocket
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:28:40 Ig
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:29:17 I like this game but I’m gonna have very little time to play it after easter weekend
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:29:55 The colour red keeps breaking on my monitor
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:30:01 Gpu is broken or something
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:30:49 Its only on one
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:30:56 But it’s plugged into displayport
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:31:00 And the other is hdmi
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:31:18 It’s fixed when i unplug it and plug it back in but every couple of days it happens again
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:32:09 I built my own pc with a 5900x and a 3080ti and I barely have time to use it 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:04 5800x3d outperforms 5900x by a large margin
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:08 It’s way newer
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:35 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:43 Don’t do that
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:33:47 Just shortens the lifespan
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:34:29 Yeah man!!!
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:34:41 Spent 8 months designing it and researching
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:34:47 Then I built it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:35:51 10th gen intel
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:35:54 my condolences
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:36:00 💀

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:36:28 42mhz is early 90s mid speed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:36:43 yeah most people aren't as passionate
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:36:58 needed optimal cooling
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:37:27 yeah but I did it in a way that every little box is checked
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:37:59 
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:38:02 ryzen 💪

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:27 
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:36 yeah I need it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:39:40 to host minecraft server
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:40:11 you have to limit the ram usage
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:40:29 it should be fine with even only 4 gigabytes with 3-5 people
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:40:57 but it's javascript so it consumes more and more over time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:03 cause javascript is ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:17 lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 06:41:19 dell?

general 2023-04-09 20:48:09 taste like ASS
general 2023-04-09 20:48:16 jk but I prefer the mammoth stuff
general 2023-04-09 20:48:26 just took c4 itchy all over
general 2023-04-09 20:48:31 caffeine overdose 🥶 \
general 2023-04-09 20:48:47 ikr
general 2023-04-09 20:48:54 I love the feeling of ants under my skin
general 2023-04-09 20:49:21 yeah you overdose and die at 400mg
general 2023-04-09 20:49:26 I take ~350
general 2023-04-09 20:49:41 and I have to make sure I eat enough or else I get heart pain
general 2023-04-09 20:49:42 xd
general 2023-04-09 20:49:46 it's superset
general 2023-04-09 20:49:49 the last thing I have
general 2023-04-09 20:49:56 its the best one but it tastes like GARBAGE
general 2023-04-09 20:50:14 it really depends how fast you consume it and what you're doing
general 2023-04-09 20:50:27 I took 325mg while I was fasting and almost died
general 2023-04-09 20:50:57 batch 27 is the best pre
general 2023-04-09 20:51:00 unless you want creatine
general 2023-04-09 20:51:01 but like
general 2023-04-09 20:51:03 take that separate idiot
general 2023-04-09 20:51:11 peach rings flavour
general 2023-04-09 20:51:30 there's creatine in most med stim pre
general 2023-04-09 20:51:36 c4 and mammoth both have creatine
general 2023-04-09 20:51:50 never in high stim though
general 2023-04-09 20:51:56 yeah
general 2023-04-09 20:52:04 i studied creatine and I shouldn't go bald
general 2023-04-09 20:52:11 idek what those are
general 2023-04-09 20:52:13 I just eat protein
general 2023-04-09 20:52:14 lol
general 2023-04-09 20:52:23 creatine is separate though
general 2023-04-09 20:52:28 from regular amino acids
general 2023-04-09 20:52:32 cause amino acids are in everything
general 2023-04-09 20:52:42 its just types of protein
general 2023-04-09 20:53:00 do you ever drink milk-based whey protein and leave it out for a night and it ferments into cheese
general 2023-04-09 20:53:09 I didn't
general 2023-04-09 20:53:12 I just looked at the study
general 2023-04-09 20:53:22 balding is a possible side effect because it raises testoserone
general 2023-04-09 20:53:33 but mine shouldn't be so high that it raises past healthy levels
general 2023-04-09 20:53:53 for me it only happens when there's very little left in the bottle
general 2023-04-09 20:53:59 if I forget and leave it out full it's fine3
general 2023-04-09 20:54:09 exaact,y

general 2023-04-09 20:54:22 but I look at my father
general 2023-04-09 20:54:23 and I know
general 2023-04-09 20:54:32 bald since mid 20s

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:14:30 E for excellent
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:15:41 Classes in order are english, french, careers, math
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:15:42 Grade 10
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:22:44 Less creatine more reading
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:22:54 Idk what a gpa is we don’t have that here
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:23:04 But since 5 is the max I’m assuming thats not great
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:23:53 My school is so dumb
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:01 Some of my classes are half year some are full
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:09 Math full year
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:13 French full year
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:20 Civics & careers full year
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:25 English half
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:30 History half
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:32 Science half
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:24:52 I took anthro for next year but I’m gonna drop out cause I don’t have that much time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:25:00 It interests me but I need to have a life
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:25:04 I have literally no free time
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:25:14 Only reason I’m here is cause it’s easter weekend
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:25:49 They decided to move exams up a month
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:02 We literally don’t have enough time to cover all of the course material
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:10 So work is being thrown at me
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:26 Only my english teacher is reasonable with little assignments
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:39 No they’re just stupid
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:44 Everyone in my school is an idiot
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:26:53 So they need a second chance on exams
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:08 I got a 90 on the first math exam
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:11 Someone got a 63
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:24 They were allowed to do an extremely easy make up assignment
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:27 Got a 91.5
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:41 The leverage is insane
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:27:47 And I suffer because of their stupidity
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:28:21 Ohh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:28:30 Our culminating tasks don’t have leverage
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:28:36 What 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:28:39 You can just cheat
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:29:02 At home too?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:29:09 Cause if you have a whole week
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:29:12 Just google it at home
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:29:44 I switched schools this year
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:29:58 And everyone is a little strange
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:30:07 So I didn’t talk at all for the first 3 months
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:30:26 Then I started taking meds and wasn’t really myself and talked to everyone
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:30:42 Then I got a girlfriend and stopped taking meds now I talk to no one
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:30:52 Yeah not for anything social though
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:30:54 For mdd
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:31:19 The side effects of SSRIs are CRAZY
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:31:26 I’m gonna start again soon
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:31:42 I have insomnia
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:31:47 I told them I have insomnia
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:32:02 They give me medication that causes trouble sleeping but also fatigue
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:32:14 And potentially a personality change
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:32:16 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:33:03 Made me really paranoid too
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:33:06 Fr
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:33:17 Sleep like a baby now
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:33:47 Need meds to revive egomania 💪
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:33:56 I was only taking 5mg I think
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:00 Or 10
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:04 Don’t remember
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:10 Bro what 😭
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:16 You’re schizophrenic?
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:27 That sucks
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:48 They thought I might be schizoid or schizotypal but I don’t really match the definition
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:34:58 The meds are all basically the same anyway it makes no difference
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:35:16 Mdd is 40% genetic factors
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:35:24 Having children is a moral dilemma
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:35:27 🤣
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:35:45 Fr
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:35:53 Good character development
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:36:33 I thought I was bipolar but I was just really shitty and then I was normal for 2 weeks and thought I was manic 💀
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:37:09 Nah thats bipolar 2
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:37:12 Its for losers
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:37:26 Bipolar 2 is basically a normal person that gets a little happier and a little sadder
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:37:36 No thats bipolar turned up a bunch
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:37:44 Bipolar 2 is half as intense
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:38:10 Cyclothymia is the same thing but the cycle is 3 days depressive 2 days manic instead of 2 weeks 1 week
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:38:16 And there’s no meds for it
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:38:28 I’m unipolar 💪
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:38:41 What is a dsm5
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:39:08 I read about it because it took 3 months to get an appointment
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:39:11 On wikipedia though
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:39:33 Wasn’t terrible actually
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:40:00 Canada “free” healthcare 💪💪
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:40:22 They diagnosed me within 10 minutes and then gave me meds but it took forever
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:40:31 You need private healthcare in canada
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:40:43 Public healthcare is waayyy too slow and low quality
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:40:51 2 years wait time for minor appointment
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:42:18 Literally same thing in canada except you pay in taxes instead of directly
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:42:26 And then they’re like “better than us!!”
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:42:36 Even if that is true why would you compare down and not up
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:42:40 Destructive nationalism
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:43:42 I think they just take it out of your paycheck themselves
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:43:47 Thats how it works for me
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:43:53 But I work for the city so that might be why
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:44:21 Lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:44:26 My first 13k is untaxed
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:44:35 They take it but they give it back january 1st
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:44:42 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:09 If I make 5k this summer I get 3k and then 2k at the end of the year
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:23 It only really affects students
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:36 Also tax is like 50% if you make an upper-working class wage
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:44 And you get NOTHING in return
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:46 Roads are ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:50 Public transport is ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:45:59 Public spaces are sparse and low quality
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:46:02 Healthcare is ass
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:46:16 I’m not LMAO
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:46:21 I moved here from europe
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:46:58 Only benefits of canada are cheaper gas (less expensive than elsewhere) and cheaper hydro
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:05 Water and electricity
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:09 Western
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:14 Urban
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:21 Now I live out in the middle of nowhere
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:45 Stacking wood and not being able to anywhere without a car 💪
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:47:59 It’s $1.80 a litre or so here
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:48:00 Idek
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:48:13 Thats almost $6 a gallon
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:48:17 It’s $5 I think
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 21:48:24 But it is cheaper
