plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:29:53 The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:30:58 She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:31:28 Cake or pie? I can tell a lot about you by which one you pick. It may seem silly, but cake people and pie people are really different. I know which one I hope you are, but that's not for me to decide. So, what is it? Cake or pie?MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There was something that made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She really didn't care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:32:36 Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time.
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:33:05 That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next.She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost.
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 05:33:48 So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads.

which effects you becauseeeeeeee china creates a quarter of allllll computer chips on the planet using the semiconductors 

soo because they dont have the semiconductors to make the chips computer part prices will go up

general 2022-10-22 06:31:39 not much?
general 2022-10-22 06:32:04 do you know how relatively small the plane crazy fanbase is
general 2022-10-22 06:32:32 lets do some quick math
general 2022-10-22 06:33:38 the average active player amount in plane crazy is 4000 people correct?
general 2022-10-22 06:33:55 assuming the average player spends about... 5 hours online?
general 2022-10-22 06:34:23 we could say the average # of players per day is somewhere around 25000 players
general 2022-10-22 06:34:33 in the us alone
general 2022-10-22 06:34:48 there is 25,100,000 children
general 2022-10-22 06:36:02 the 25000 people playing plane crazy daily is about .001% of the children in the united states alone
general 2022-10-22 06:36:51 however this isnt factoring in the average amount of plane crazy video views
general 2022-10-22 06:37:30 the highest viewed plane crazy youtube video has 300k views
general 2022-10-22 06:38:01 lets assumes about 60k of those are rewatches  and single time players right?
general 2022-10-22 06:38:09 so we have 240k
general 2022-10-22 06:38:53 240 k is only 0.0008 % of the population of the united states alone
general 2022-10-22 06:39:41 i would say thats a fairly highball estimate of what percent of children are affected by plane crazy youtube videos
general 2022-10-22 06:39:56 i round for his sake
general 2022-10-22 06:40:24 so the answer is not much
general 2022-10-22 06:40:33 what are you talking about?
general 2022-10-22 06:41:23 240k is the highest repeating value of youtube watches in the plane crazy category

general 2022-10-22 06:43:20 there is more but im not going to continue
general 2022-10-22 06:43:51 maximum
general 2022-10-22 06:44:00 maximum
general 2022-10-22 06:44:07 thats about where it caps
general 2022-10-22 06:44:29 math is logic you dipship XD
general 2022-10-22 06:47:12 i am taking the highest viewed videos of plane crazy and averaging them to get the aproximate plane crazy maximum outreach number 

then i am taking that number and dividing the population of the united states of america because most players are in the usa althought the number im getting skews negatively because im leaving out other countries

then i get that percent and i tell you that mathematically the MAXIMUM outreach on a plane crazy video reaches only 0.0008%  of a fraction of the world child population 

and you say that isnt logic?
general 2022-10-22 06:47:18 i think youre illogical
general 2022-10-22 06:48:03 yes
general 2022-10-22 06:48:15 how can it mentally impact people who never saw it
general 2022-10-22 06:48:22 HOW DID YOU KNOW ðŸ’€
general 2022-10-22 06:48:35 thats racist
general 2022-10-22 06:49:23 ok let me spell this out for you even further 

plane crazy youtube CANNOT EFFECT PEOPLE WHO HAVENT WATCHED PLANE CRAZY VIDEOS
general 2022-10-22 06:50:10 how many people play plane crazy only once?
general 2022-10-22 06:50:17 you give me average daily players
general 2022-10-22 06:50:37 thats not a number
general 2022-10-22 06:50:42 i need a single number
general 2022-10-22 06:50:48 it cant be an interval
general 2022-10-22 06:51:11 2 to 5k sent a number its a set of numbers
general 2022-10-22 06:51:21 idek who nam is ðŸ’€
general 2022-10-22 06:51:42 no its not average is a single number
general 2022-10-22 06:52:06 ok so if i picked 2001 players play plane crazy daily yes?
general 2022-10-22 06:52:19 it would be the same as picking 4999?
general 2022-10-22 06:52:37 prove me wrong?
general 2022-10-22 06:52:43 how is my math wrong?
general 2022-10-22 06:52:48 cause you cant?
general 2022-10-22 06:52:49 lmao
general 2022-10-22 06:53:13 ok no caps for a second
general 2022-10-22 06:53:19 lets have a causal chat
general 2022-10-22 06:53:59 you are saying... plane crazy youtube videos have made children stupider yes?
general 2022-10-22 06:54:07 ok so
general 2022-10-22 06:55:06 so is it fair to say people who havent seen plane crazy youtube videos are unable to be affected by plane crazy videos
general 2022-10-22 06:55:37 <@577655331229007872>
general 2022-10-22 06:57:32 ok so if it is fair to say the people who havent seen plane crazy youtube videos arent affected then you calculating the MAXIMUM amount of people the videos reach  and then take that and divide it by the number of children to get the maximum percent of people the videos can reach?
general 2022-10-22 06:57:35 <@577655331229007872>
general 2022-10-22 06:58:11 do you know how to find percent of something?
general 2022-10-22 06:58:20 like 10 is what percent of 424
general 2022-10-22 06:58:23 ?
general 2022-10-22 06:59:57 ok so if you can do that math right
general 2022-10-22 07:00:18 then if you take the maximum number of people the youtube videos see
general 2022-10-22 07:00:55 a number divided by a total times 10 is the percent of the number
general 2022-10-22 07:01:52 <@577655331229007872> i believe you know now you are why you were wrong yes?
general 2022-10-22 07:02:07 about what in specific
general 2022-10-22 07:04:46 we have agreed videos cannot effect people who havent seen them so if we get the most number of people effected by the videos

(knowing how to find percent of a number ex. 10 percent of 30 you do 10 divided by 30 and then that multiplied by 100 to get 30)

so we divided the maximum amount of people by the approximated number of children in the united states of america  multiplied by 100 to get the percent of children in america who have seen a plane crazy video
general 2022-10-22 07:05:20 do you get it now?
general 2022-10-22 07:05:51 me?
general 2022-10-22 07:06:07 by the youtube videos
general 2022-10-22 07:07:45 the answer is no because if only 0.009 percent of children have seen a plane crazy video THAT IS A SMALLLLL VALUE so no it is not able to be said that plane crazy videos negatively effect childrens intelligence
general 2022-10-22 07:08:32 if we agree that people who havent seen a plane crazy video cannot be affected by it than my math proves my point in that plane crazy does not affect average child intelligence
general 2022-10-22 07:09:05 <@577655331229007872> do you understand why you are wrong now?
