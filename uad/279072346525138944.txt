creations-chat 2020-02-11 00:56:27 I would have had the missle swarm more compact, but attempting to make all the missles spread out instead of all of them flying in the same direction took some room
creations-chat 2020-02-11 00:56:34 honestly
creations-chat 2020-02-11 00:56:42 it just looks kewl

plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:23:31 this is a true epic gamer moment, I would love to give my thanks to everyone that upvoted it
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:24:15 100 upvotes, I truly have no life now
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:26:09 honestly this is the reason i also want to jump out the window at night
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:26:43 cause the only mods I have seen who talked so far[ I have not been here that long] don't like the idea of minecraft shit
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:27:59 look in <#609442446249820211> and go for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:28:01 or challenge
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:28:04 or something idk
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:28:57 build a 4000 block ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:29:41 i think i got something
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:30:30 
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:31:29 I was thinking about doing it today
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:31:40 but I already had pixel art material
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:31:46 and I also got bored
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:31:51 within 10 squares
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:32:38 terrain seems a little easier in my opinion, but that is just me
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:32:41 trust me
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:32:52 you will have enough room to lay it onto the ground
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:33:25 terrain does require less blocks for the V rank
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:33:45 yep
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:34:43 I actually do not see naval that often at all
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:34:55 I sure if you ask in a pvp server you might be able to get it going
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:35:05 but lots of people default to air pvp
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:35:09 or gound with tanks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:35:14 /turrets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:36:23 against the best flying jets, the only way you are going to take one down is with a smaller, more maneuverable jet
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:36:35 uh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:36:53 not common because everyone is asses to eachother
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:37:00 if you do it, then you are a nice person
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:37:29 hitting a fast aircraft is hard to do with guns from spawn
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:37:36 missles travel too slow
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:39:59 imagine trying to hit a 8 by 8 block triangle that goes ~150 sps on average
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:40:08 said triangle is in spawn
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:40:16 where you are , is the docks
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:40:24 sounds difficult doesn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 04:40:37 yes
