plane-crazy 2019-11-24 16:53:21 Designer: say no more
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:37:25 found the reason.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:37:52 My Motor 2 is on servo and toggle btw... It gets flinged when i anchor it...
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:37:59 i mean anchor the rest of the vehicle..
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:38:08 without the motor itself.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:38:24 When vehicle isn't anchored at all, then everything is fine.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:39:38 oh and the vehicle itself needs to move a bit, So turrents that don't move themselves forward, backward and etc should work fine.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:40:14 i didn't find anything in dev console for some reason.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:42:09 aka the motor fling problem.
bug-reports 2019-11-28 12:42:45 fun fact: before the update everything worked fine.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 13:37:56 This is KV-20_Zhukov, A mobile artillery from tom clancys endwar or something. Idk but i wanted to build it... It's my first land vehicle, and also first... Cannon? idk how it's called, that is able to reload. I use TNT ball as Ammo.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 13:38:13 i have no idea why main cannon tilts like this but thats fine i guess.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 13:38:37 range of it is 4 building spaces or more.

creations-chat 2019-11-28 13:39:34 yesn't
creations-chat 2019-11-28 13:40:37 this is what it looks like in game... Before upgrades and etc... ISN'T SIMILLAR AT ALL... Jk it's kinda... I don't know?
bug-reports 2019-11-28 13:42:17 <@!217336009455566848> Fix it fast cuz i wanna annoy other players with my artillery.

plane-crazy 2020-08-10 14:01:58 > i actually prefer thrusters because it doesn't ***LAUNCH*** you instantly into the air.
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 14:02:48 Tbh there should be a special type of motor for helicopters that would combine realistic startup of thrusters, and the lack of thrusters making it ugly.
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 14:02:51 Anyway

Red things - Taillights
Front - yeah... no idea what could be wrong with that
creations-chat 2021-01-08 20:52:47 oh yeah... that seems... understandable... those were kinda supposed to be antennas or something i guess?
i needed to put something in the back of it so i just added 2 antennas, and added 2 extra on the front for no reason
creations-chat 2021-01-08 20:54:54 well in that case i need an idea for a replacement for that...
help 2021-01-08 20:55:39 It appears that people dislike the "poles" (actually antennas but ok) on my thing (whatever that is) so uh.
give me an idea for a good replacement that won't live the back empty lol.

creations-chat 2021-01-09 09:28:40 Using awesome lightshot, i've made a lot of screenshots that didn't contain my roblox character in it, so from that screenshot that guy gave us, i can clearly tell that it isn't his creation, here are some reasons:
1: censored plot owner username
2: the screenshot is "missplaced" 
   explaination on point 2: Just try taking a screenshot of a random thing on the right of your screen, and screenshot only that small tiny bit of space, you will notice that it looks weird. 
3: Yes.
so therefore, in my opinion, he didn't make it.
creations-chat 2021-01-09 09:31:14 ima go to ms paint and see how easy or hard it is to change the colour.
ill just need a random screenshot of someone

creations-chat 2021-01-09 11:17:04 there is nothing wrong with using a tutorial if you want to learn something new, like motorlocking, copying a whole creation is wrong, especially if it's a shredder bug, if you copied a shredder bug you can die.
creations-chat 2021-01-09 11:20:03 im sorry <@!442257205689843713> but <@456226577798135808> is absolutely correct here, That indeed is in fact a low effort build.

creations-chat 2021-01-10 21:19:37 fun facts with singler: 
according to that logic you should hate yourself, since you stand out, which therefore according to you ruins everything, so therefore, you hate things like that, which means you hate yourself.

Keep in mind that this is just a hull, which isn't even finished, lacks frontal hovers, and also keep in mind that this is pretty much my first tank.

on the left there are motor 2, far left motor 2 is a servo toggle, rotates 45* upwards and the second green is another is mouse controlled motor, max rotation of 30* in both directions. Any ideas how i can make this NOT have a SEIZURE?
help 2021-01-13 17:27:26 same thing happend when using motor 1
help 2021-01-13 17:28:36 i found out why it happens tho
help 2021-01-13 17:28:43 the motor on the left rotates even tho it's not supposed to
creations-chat 2021-01-13 17:39:06 Update: there might be no folding cannon considering how awful motors are in this game
creations-chat 2021-01-13 17:41:59 i reccomend you build something that doesn't exist, like hovering tanks, they are so rare here that people pretty much have no reference to what one should look like.
creations-chat 2021-01-13 17:44:37 you built an entire planet?

Please describe what do you think was wrong with it and how i could improve it. Your feedback would be appreciated.
creations-chat 2021-02-21 18:56:36 I hope they aren't biased and only like WWII creations, since this server is all about them, give WWII lovers a futuristic thing that isn't based off anything and they freak out since they don't know what to do lol. Im not specificially talking about the above mentioned people, but i have posted quite a bit of stuff like that and well, this is pretty much what happens, thankfully most of people are quite nice.
creations-chat 2021-02-21 18:58:44 Damn, they all build millitary related stuff, i was partially right. We'll see thier feedback...
creations-chat 2021-02-21 19:02:47 I mean, isn't it kinda the point?

Thanks in advance.
This is gonna be interesting.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:45:06 Your toxicity is not needed, as im only harvesting opinions and information which i need. I absolutely don't care about your SR-71 and the fact that you are comparing a plane to a ship is absolutely ridiculous, anyway. Please describe why do you think it looks plain and boring and elaborate on the "advanced detail"
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:50:08 Yes.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:52:11 yay, somewhat useful opinion! althru the detailing on the front is currently undergoing some improvments.

Also im NOT trying to start an argument, and the fact that asking for information about how i could improve my build is just stupid. so stop it yall.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:57:27 <@!614403110319685643>  yep. Althru they work quite badly and im trying to fix them, they DO work.

thank you everyone for understanding me, your feedback is highly apprecieated, and so, if you find something you don't like about the yacht, tell me it. Ill be more than happy to hear that.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 09:59:36 there is this one room in my yacht that needs some love in it.

please stop comparing a ship to a plane, there is no point in doing that.

general 2021-10-09 19:14:29 but it worked
general 2021-10-09 19:14:35 so proof of concept is there
general 2021-10-09 19:14:50 heck, i even made the rotors tilt forward
general 2021-10-09 19:14:57 (althru it wasn't really that balanced)
general 2021-10-09 19:18:32 oh yeah, i forgot that i can make ships lol

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:40:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:40:51 he failed to crash the server

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:41:08 but he can't
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:41:16 and thats all because i can't pvp him in a Non PVP server
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:44:25 he really fucking thinks that if you block someone the person thats blocked can't see what you say

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:30:18 it has no suspension whatsoever.
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:30:29 heck, doesn't even have wheels
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 19:30:39 tank with no wheels > thank with wheels or tracks or whatever

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:18:22 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:18:30 isn't originality more about the execution of an idea
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:18:33 rather than the concept itself?
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:18:56 what kind of rides are u talking about tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 17:19:01 rollercoasters?

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:49:16 i just got accused for having my tank copied from youtube!
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:49:18 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:49:33 yep
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:49:41 he said that he saw it on youtube 3 times
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:50:10 (this is the tank btw)
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:50:15 that i allegedly copied off youtube
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:50:46 Im going to ask the guy a trick question
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:50:52 if he really saw the video
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:50:59 then how will he respond to "does this tank have interior?"
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:51:28 thankfully it's a trick question since the interior is shit but it's there
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:51:41 so both "no" and "yes" answers are correct
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:53:07 <@!404632014189494293> <@!345527706340818944> HE GAVE ME A TITLE

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:55:55 lol!!!
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:56:39 the guy said that the chain on my tank is different
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:56:42 my tank design doesn't have a chain
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 18:58:04 Mate calls my tank a tutorial

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:11:41 How to get a shit ton of upvotes in <#384025409945337856> tutorial 2021 working:
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:11:48 1. build something that doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:12:05 2. people can't reference what it is because it's not real, so they upvote due to being unable to criticise
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:12:08 3. win
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:12:39 just don't make it look bad and you win
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:13:27 I am digging the custom build mine
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:13:31 and i gotta say
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:13:34 it's beatiful
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:13:45 give me a sec
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:13:59

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:14:49 it's beatiful
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:14:50 i love it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:14:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:15:08 this thing isn't as custom as you may think though
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:15:20 this tank is actually a result of a chain reaction
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:15:31 Not finished so im not gonna comment on it yet
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:16:29 anyway
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:16:35 here is a mini roadmap on how the tank came to life
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:16:40 so first i found this artwork
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:16:58 so i made something similar but different
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:17:07 decided that i want a tank now and did this
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:25:40 e
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 07:47:23 i have made the decision to build a self propelled artillery or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:13:45 building a self propelled hover artillery or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:28:17 i like how this is going so far
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:29:48 thats not a tractor
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:30:04 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:31:33 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:31:35 shut up
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:31:36 not a tractor
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:31:56 this isn't a tractor and never will be
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 08:32:13 get over it
creations-chat 2021-10-14 09:50:35 I built a self propelled artillery vehicle (it hovers lol)

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:53:07 i built an artillery vehicle, opinions?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:55:59 call it a tractor and ill use it to crush your balls
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:57:08 say goodbye to your balls
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:57:21 shut up and give me actual feedback
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:00 i don't want to ruin it for you
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:02 but those aren't wheels
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:13 those aren't tracks
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:32 Design choice
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:49 the yellow on hover engines is now a trademark
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:58:52 cannot remove it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:59:11 ill make that higher
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:59:28 this is the artillery turret thing at the back
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 09:59:45 this is how it looks like when deployed

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:13:06 the turret wasn't anchored
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:13:12 and even the turret stayed intact
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:13:20 so his shredderbugs were just garbage

creations-chat 2021-12-22 19:17:35 Super Idol de xiaorong
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:23:42 Ayo what's happening here
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:25:44 Damn that looks sick.
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:27:45 Polish people on their way to brag about being polish despite no one giving a shit:
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:30:27 Hold on I'll find my tank as an example of a less terrible tank
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:33:18 Here, an image of a relatively good tank, notice the stuff it has or whatever

I could have probably found something else someone else made but eh, might be a good time to get criticism for it again
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:35:20 Actually, it keeps a good balance of smooth and not so smooth, or at least I think so
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:37:22 Also, my tank doesn't use motorlock whatsoever, so you just have a skill issue, learn how to build nice things that people will deem enjoyable rather than complaining about it being downvoted

You don't need motorlock (although it is useful), just build something nice
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:39:36 Dumbass. Even this tank got 80 upvotes

Nice tank though
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:42:18 Learn to build and people will upvote it. Simple. 

Look at my bus, not even finished and I'm certain there are people that will already like it

(Btw this is my first bus)
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:44:21 STRIKE!
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:46:27 Could have been better


<@447139512707973120> LMAO
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:48:50 Aight guys I'm tired of this shit show, lest just say that this polish guy has skill issue and call it a day
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:50:59 >me who barely uses motorlock and people still like my builds
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:53:01 I'd like a heaping spoonful of criticism. 
Give me what you think about this
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:55:07 I know I'm reposting this but... 
This build uses almost no motorlock, your excuse?
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:57:08 It's mostly clever block placement, uses 1 motorlock at the front underbelly, that part is not visible in the photo
creations-chat 2021-12-22 21:59:10 Actually I recently powered it up, and it can absolutely do 360 degrees, with powerful firearms. Sure it's not op but at least hovers keep it from ramming based ground builds

So get owned ur wrong
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:01:24 Also isn't it 23 in Poland? Go to sleep child

Also also
1 no
2.no
3.no, you asked for it
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:03:27 All I know is that I can't build planes. They look shit, and mostly fly like shit   :(
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:05:28 I know mine isn't good at PvP, I actually didn't really try but I don't give enough fucks to even bother
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:07:29 Motorlocking is literally pressing the "lock" Button in a motors setting
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:10:14 It sure is


Mate just ducking blacklist shredder users, problem solved
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:12:16 Don't give him ideas
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:14:21 Oh the irony
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:19:38 Child mad cuz build bad, build bad got downvoted much, made child angry, child whine. Whiny child screamy chat
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:21:40 The airport on top
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:23:44 You can't one shot my tank. And people consider it a good build, now shup up and go to sleep
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:25:57 Simple, I won't spawn my tank, can't damage a build that's in build mode. 

<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-22 22:28:00 At this point you're just talking bullshit

creations-chat 2021-12-23 08:10:20 Im building a bus, it's like my first bus ever so don't kill me but criticism would be nice.
The doors also open and were a huge nightmare to work with.

creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:48:20 Well duh, the walkway is flat, you're not supposed to be able to walk on flat surfaces so you won't flip over when going from the drivers seat to a cannon

The walkway needs to be unusable

Walkway is basically a path
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:51:00 I don't know anything about his rep
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:53:44 Hars speedrunning calling a perfectly recreated 1:1 build "shit cuz bad design" <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:56:09 I don't want to sound politicial, sure hars has weird expectations but this starts to look like harassment
Little tomfoolery is okay but it seems to me like it's going a BIT too far

I have a quite specific style of military vehicles, these are my only vehicles of this specific type i have, mostly hovers.

creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:24:38 Adding onto this: The best way to to avoid people like this is give them no point of reference whatsoever, don't build real shit, build a fucking futuristic flying tank.

They can't compare it to anything real, so they won't bitch about you forgetting to add a 2 cm diameter pole going alongside pretending to be a cable.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:30:52 Jokes on you! i use exposed motorlock and call it "decoration"

creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:42:12 I wish I had the plane knowledge bto comment on this
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:45:29 When I called out the server for being too harsh, downvoting every build, I was just called bad, a dumbass, etc. 

People here need to grow up and preferably now
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:47:51 I lack required plane knowledge to comment on this airplane.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:51:11 I just build sci fi shit, so whenever someone goes "boohoo this doesn't look detailed enough" I just can go "shut the fuck up you don't know what it's even supposed to look like"

Works like a charm


<@536156275596197889> idk I never built a working plane in this game lol
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:53:23 Build sci-fi aircraft, problem solved


Your own design or something idk
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:55:46 Shut the fuck up and touch grass
creations-chat 2022-03-20 21:58:20 I've got you covered. 

Just google "sci-fi (object name) art" Or "futuristic (thing name here) art" And you're good to go
help 2022-03-20 21:59:12 I did not ask
help 2022-03-20 22:01:16 Bitch I was showing a mechanic for that dude, not asking for approval
help 2022-03-20 22:02:39 I'm glad to announce that I can't help you with that
help 2022-03-20 22:03:05 ..?
help 2022-03-20 22:03:16 I literally said I can't
help 2022-03-20 22:03:47 I make weird futuristic shit
help 2022-03-20 22:03:49 Not planes
help 2022-03-20 22:03:59 I have no fucking idea how to build a working plane
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:05:31 🧐
help 2022-03-20 22:06:05 Anyway
help 2022-03-20 22:06:10 
help 2022-03-20 22:06:20 This thing has shit rear
help 2022-03-20 22:06:36 And im too busy with life to think of something
help 2022-03-20 22:06:45 So think of something for me to make the rear pretty
help 2022-03-20 22:06:53 I'll look here tomorrow for pings
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:08:37 You guys should just lower the standards, not everyone has time to make pixel perfect builds. For example I barely have 5 hours of free time per day.
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:14:41 I mean what's even the point of having a help channel if no one uses it to help others. I posted my tank there to get some help with Deco like 3 times and no response
help 2022-03-20 22:16:21 Wdym
creations-chat 2022-03-20 22:17:17 I literally had a completely unrelated build there called ugly despite the fact that it was supposed to showcase a mechanic to some dude.
help 2022-03-21 05:51:17 Your input was very not valuable. 

I clearly said what I don't like and you went on to comment something unrelated which doesn't solve my problem.

You should probably stop using this channel, considering that you also got into an argument with someone here.
help 2022-03-21 06:30:54 You can use both seats to control whatever you built, it's just that the main pilot seat is used to spawn the aircraft and seat you there, but If you want you can hop off, and on to a regular pilot seat and use the vehicle the same way you would do with a main one
creations-chat 2022-03-21 06:48:11 Question, how do I make a sci-fi tank rear not look like shit?
creations-chat 2022-03-21 06:50:35 Your argument is childish, both of you grow up please.
creations-chat 2022-03-21 06:52:50 Probably

This server nowadays is a toxic shitshow. 

There isn't even a point anymore in using <#384025409945337856> because every single pissy shit downvotes everything
creations-chat 2022-03-21 06:56:23 I told that guy to grow up for arguing with a random person and now they're going Jackshit over me lol
creations-chat 2022-03-21 06:58:57 Society moment
creations-chat 2022-03-21 07:00:58 You can't expect me to know who's your friend and isn't. 

Plus I literally told you guys to stop arguing and what you do? Argue with me instead. Oh the irony
creations-chat 2022-03-21 07:02:59 You should probably stop forcing people to argue and grow up
creations-chat 2022-03-21 07:07:00 I will never add wheels

To any of my shit
help 2022-03-21 13:34:26 jokes on you, i do have bitches.
help 2022-03-21 13:56:57 did i ask "is my colour scheme shit?"
help 2022-03-21 13:59:51 I literally asked for help in making the rear of my vehicle look better
help 2022-03-21 13:59:58 and you go out of your way to argue
help 2022-03-21 14:00:06 and ping me for no fucking reason
help 2022-03-21 14:00:11 about a comment written
help 2022-03-21 14:00:21 more than 5 hours ago
help 2022-03-21 14:00:45 do you guys not have a life and have to complain about every single thing that doesn't even inconvenience you?
help 2022-03-21 14:01:26 Do you need a motherfucking dedicated signed letter with a fucking 500 pound stamp to tell you that i only asked for a single thing?
help 2022-03-21 14:01:44 Shut the fuck up don't even reply
help 2022-03-21 14:01:49 i don't need your "valuable insults"
help 2022-03-21 14:12:02 ok, but i asked about the fucking shape of the rear
help 2022-03-21 14:12:19 you could have just told me that
help 2022-03-21 14:13:02 ironically, this was the least helpful thing in a channel literally made for that.
help 2022-03-21 14:15:06 i can probably change the yellow if you will be more specific next time
help 2022-03-21 14:17:18 just
help 2022-03-21 14:17:23 swap the controls around using
help 2022-03-21 14:17:27 this funky tool:
help 2022-03-21 14:17:30 
help 2022-03-21 14:17:38 so they're not inverted
help 2022-03-21 14:18:33 elaborate
help 2022-03-21 14:19:08 we have very different ideas of what sci-fi is
help 2022-03-21 14:19:53 as a counter argument id like to state that
help 2022-03-21 14:19:59 i yeeted the colours off this and added the red stuff
help 2022-03-21 14:20:29 i strongly dislike this thing
help 2022-03-21 14:20:42 this actually looks cool
help 2022-03-21 14:20:51 but i kinda
help 2022-03-21 14:20:53 like the colours???
help 2022-03-21 14:21:24 actually i did post it

help 2022-07-13 18:12:30 okay so, im building a futuristic bomber n shit, you know, whatever, trying to make a functional plane for once and i've got this problem:
help 2022-07-13 18:12:48 and the problem in question is that i have no fucking idea how to continue the fuselage of the thing
help 2022-07-13 18:22:27 ok but otherwise it's a fucking wing or shit and im gonna need the fuselage to fit in the extra engines since i suck at aircraft design
help 2022-07-13 18:22:48 plus you know, bomb bay n shit
help 2022-07-13 18:33:08 oh so you want me to go for a 2 rudder design
help 2022-07-13 18:33:35 this will also technically allow me to get some extra space for whatever at the back
help 2022-07-13 18:33:45 yeah ill do that
help 2022-07-13 18:33:54 thank you
help 2022-07-14 05:45:45 𝘈𝘣𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺 𝘯𝘰𝘵
help 2022-07-14 05:46:23 That colouring is specific to a certain theme and it's stays
help 2022-07-14 05:46:33 Bitch i didn't ask for colouring feedback
help 2022-07-14 05:46:42 Go ahead then

help 2022-07-14 05:47:17 Now with that out of the way

help 2022-07-14 05:47:36 Figure out then
help 2022-07-14 05:47:49 The fuselage doesn't exist yet lmao
help 2022-07-14 05:48:41 I failed to understand the gibberish after "move wings back"
help 2022-07-14 05:50:11 >someone asks for feedback
>provides Unintelligible gibberish no one understands
help 2022-07-14 05:50:56 You do realise that "make them longer" And "make them shorter" Contradicts itself right
help 2022-07-14 05:51:38 Your context sucked then
help 2022-07-14 05:52:15 Yeah no im gonna stick to context sucking
help 2022-07-14 08:15:22 I need a nice wood colour, anyone knows any?

creations-chat 2022-07-15 19:05:27 Im not actually from the UK, i just like people thinkin that im from UK just to be fucking wrong ❤️

very satisfactory feeling when they're straight up wrong.
creations-chat 2022-07-15 19:09:39 He's scared because he met a fake British person (straight teeth)
creations-chat 2022-10-17 12:39:37 uh-huh
help 2023-07-18 06:55:37 I am now suffering the consequences of being terrible at building regular planes and in a dire need of an airplane which width doesn't exceed 7 blocks. ***and i have no idea how to even begin building one, send help***
help 2023-07-18 07:15:59 the issue is that i have little to no experience building planes and whenever i try to make a somewhat realistic one i end up with a 5 year old drawing.
help 2023-07-18 07:16:32 I can literally build anything as long as it's sci-fi or some crap but if it's remotely similar to irl then im screwed, and i need something remotely similar to irl.
help 2023-07-18 07:16:53 also the grumman isn't exactly what i need
help 2023-07-18 07:16:56 i need something one sec
help 2023-07-18 07:17:15 something closer to this
help 2023-07-18 07:17:31 since i plan to slap it onto a light carrier.
help 2023-07-18 07:17:54 No you don't see
help 2023-07-18 07:17:58 you have been blinded by the sun
help 2023-07-18 07:18:05 blasphemy

help 2023-07-18 07:22:45 ***impressive progress***
help 2023-07-18 07:23:21 the scale is
help 2023-07-18 07:23:27 "make sure it fits in this tiny elevator"
help 2023-07-18 07:23:39 the elevator is 9 blocks wide
help 2023-07-18 07:24:00 i haven't played this game in ages is that something new
help 2023-07-18 07:24:10 absolutely
help 2023-07-18 07:24:14 at least one of them
help 2023-07-18 07:24:23 there's no way im gonna control several of them
help 2023-07-18 07:24:31 or fit them on this narrow carrier in a formation pattern
help 2023-07-18 07:24:41 short afk
help 2023-07-18 07:24:46 also i do have the ranked role

help 2023-07-18 07:28:33 henlo
help 2023-07-18 07:30:48 anyway
help 2023-07-18 07:30:50 about that plane
help 2023-07-18 07:32:02 where do i find the link i haven't
help 2023-07-18 07:32:06 ages
help 2023-07-18 07:32:06 played and looked at the server in like
bot-central 2023-07-18 07:34:06 -servers
creations-chat 2023-07-18 11:48:40 i challenge you to give me constructive criticism without being too toxic. (Difficulty: impossible)


Oh yeah, i forgot to mention, just to make this extra difficult, this isn't based off anything in particular, so no reference points >:3
creations-chat 2023-07-18 11:50:54 challenge ~~failure 💔~~ succesful ❤️
creations-chat 2023-07-18 11:53:23 wdyymmmmm
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:06:49 unfortunately, according to my handy dandy reference, the hull is infact a wedge.
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/990344627297087498/1130833208322306078/1000.png?width=836&height=676
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:08:56 I mean, i could make this part a little bit more "gradual"
by changing 1x2 wedge to a 1x4
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:11:02 Blame plot size limits, I cannot really make this thing any wider, i wish i could.
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:13:28 what kind of measurment do you want, while it's folded, unfolded, lenght width?
also wtf is pop out lock i haven't played this game in like bagillion years
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:15:35 touches the borders btw. (in case you somehow didn't notice)
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:18:12 technically i can but i value myself and my well being and choose not to ruin my mental health.

I build for fun and not to appeal to the toxic masses that i know are present on this server.
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:20:41 I legitmately thought that you were blacklisted from <#384025409945337856> and didn't actually look what your black role was.
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:25:34 Oh well, now that i feel satisfied, and enjoyed building a carrier, ill let someone else pick what to build.
Light carriers: ~~Rigel Class~~ | Skorpius Alpha/Beta
Level carrier: Sarga class
Fleetline carriers: Gliese class | Skorpio class


***also i suck at planes please never ask me to build any planes ever***
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:27:46 Im not doing irl stuff because that gives the toxic twitter cesspool present on this server a reference to latch onto :3
Plus i hate that country.
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:31:56 No :3 
they're all from the ~~hit~~ now dead game "Dead ahead" (oh the irony)
creations-chat 2023-07-18 12:40:26 good idea! ill just refrain from posting anything in <#384025409945337856>.
help 2023-07-18 19:54:47 very late but who cares, good news. The carrier now has a lil drone plane :3
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:55:22 I've ran out of active friends that are online right now to share my great successes so ill do it here instead
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:55:41 after around 14 hours i figured out how to put a tiny plane on a tiny carrier.
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:55:48 unfortunately i didn't think of taking a screenshot.
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:56:01 so please imagine an image of a really tiny plane in a very majestic light aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:56:32 use your imagination
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:56:44 you play plane crazy, you should have some.
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:57:07 anyway i satisfied my need of bragging about something without any evidence, adios.
help 2023-07-18 20:12:50 yeah it's hella toxic, but there are ways to coping with it. 

Here is what i do:
- Avoid posting ***anything*** in <#384025409945337856> , that channel is the embodiment of twitter itself.
- Make it very clear that whenever you post an image of your build, that you do not care as much about what other people think and you're simply doing it for fun.
- Immedieatly remind everyone how toxic people behave.
help 2023-07-18 20:15:46 i mean creations chat isn't that bad as long as people aren't talking about a current <#384025409945337856> build, but it's still bad.
help 2023-07-18 20:16:00 that channel has a massive slowmode for a reason.
help 2023-07-18 20:17:13 these channels are literally twitter.com
help 2023-07-18 20:18:13 ***There is a subreddit?***
help 2023-07-18 20:19:21 i just looked at it and holy hell you're right
help 2023-07-18 20:20:09 I wonder what went wrong for <#384025409945337856> to get so god damn toxic though.
help 2023-07-18 20:20:32 like you used to be able to post the same stuff as of now and receive like 3-6 downvotes if your build was actually good
help 2023-07-18 20:20:43 regardless of what it was
help 2023-07-18 20:21:33 im interested, tell me more
help 2023-07-18 20:21:38 this is a history class now
help 2023-07-18 20:22:59 im not surprised for some reason.
help 2023-07-18 20:23:21 thats pretty long
help 2023-07-18 20:24:01 i hope it's not made out of entirely 1x1 pieces
help 2023-07-18 20:24:09 interesting
help 2023-07-18 20:28:12 he certainly takes building really competetively.
help 2023-07-18 20:28:37 I don't know how helpful this will be but
help 2023-07-18 20:28:43 pontoon parts might be useful?
help 2023-07-18 20:28:49 as an easy way out
help 2023-07-18 20:29:05 what even is that
help 2023-07-18 20:29:19 i like that snail
help 2023-07-18 20:29:34 huh

help 2023-07-18 20:30:01 i don't know anything!
