plane-crazy 2022-02-03 09:57:10 anyone know of a way to translate horizontal mouse movement to vertical motor movement?
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 10:00:55 yes.
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 10:01:25 taking an old plane of mine that used the original motors and I want to see if it's possible to make it mouse controlled for easier flight
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 10:55:23 I'm guessing it's not possible without some kind of redneck engineer gear system?
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 01:35:00 so that one just carries it on it's pack and then the arm cranes it into place?
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 01:35:16 It'd be neat to have a folding bridge design to go across the canyon
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 01:36:10 oh nice
