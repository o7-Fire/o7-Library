general 2021-10-02 18:57:09 Big gross
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:24:14 is this accurate?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:28:06 nah bro ur maths off
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:28:44 if a stud is 5cm,  then that cant be right
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:29:21 1m is made up of 100cm
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:30:04 yeah when you find the kph,  you can find the mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:30:34 1000 studs = 5000 cm
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:30:43 5000/100 is 50 meters per second
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:31:09 ok so now a stud equals a foot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:32:34 then if youre going 1000 studs per second where a stud equals 1 foot,  youre going aprox. 680 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:33:48 im sorry?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:18 even if thats the case, at 1000 studs per second,  youre still going 111mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:58 yeah,  that is if a stud does equal a foot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:35:16 at this point idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:18 yeah if a stud = 5cm  and youre going 1000 studs per second,  then youre going 111.87 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:37:00 only if a stud is a foot long.
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:37:44 where are these stats coming from
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:39:08 panser,  680 is only correct if we assume a stud = 1ft
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:39:34 idk man, im 6ft irl
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:40:17 "According to a blog post from 2012, 1 meter is equal to 20 Roblox studs, so a stud is 5 centimeters, and a real-life Robloxian (that is 5 studs tall) would be 25 centimeters, about 10 inches tall."
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:40:27 google says a stud is 5cm
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:41:47 ok guys lets clear this up.  if were talking about toy scale,  then 100sps = 111mph.  if were talking human scale, 1000sps = 680 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:41:53 theres the answer
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:59 1 hundred and eleven miles per hour
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:12 100sps = 100 studs per second
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:24 oh waqit
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:30 wait yeah that was a typo
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:37 i meant 1000sps for both
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:46:42 bruh Ive been trying to make a single rotor heli but its so hard to do:/
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:48:31 so were gonna factor altitude into a roblox game now?  lol
