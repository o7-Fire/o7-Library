plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:23:17 a youtuber made a vid on a possible new map bit i kinda doubt it
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:23:36 it could happen we just dont know
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:23:39 now it wasnt
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:24:09 it was just rens he made a decent vid on a possible new map
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:24:34 you right
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:24:42 i gotta go to math class lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:25:26 maybe, it was still pretty cool though
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:25:49 it would be cool to have a new map but it is a lot of work
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:26:23 or maybe a connected part to the connected map <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:26:42 i meant to say a connected part to the current map but my brain shut off
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:26:59 yeah its quite small for big ships
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:27:11 i think a port would be a cool idea but idk
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:27:29 and does anyone even use that grey, moon area?
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:27:48 id say replace the moon area with more water or grass
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:28:31 does anyone realize that theres not a single tree on the map

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:11:55 <@!723419054114865202> but can you imagine having to learn how to motor lock again but in a completly different way
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:13:52 this is my lively hood now
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:17:39 this is now 2020 in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:18:50 if 2020 wasnt already bad enough, we had some data wiped a few weeks ago and now this XD
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:19:52 i can just imagine having to switch all my motors to a new block and it sounds like hell
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:21:06 yeah now that its been 30 or so minutes idk if they are gonna fix it
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:22:30 i really dont wanna switch all my motor lock towers to a new block cause i will be there for a good few hours
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:23:32 <@!260235884937347084> me in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:25:01 we were the big brains before but they were bigger brains in the long run
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:26:53 i seriously spent a good 20 minutes destroying the thing i was making thinking why the hell the motors refused to lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:27:58 i cant do anything anymore lol my builds only look decent when i lock them
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:29:00 i have like 1 non motor lock build out of like 30 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:30:01 i honestly dont know what for at first but we used them for like detail and fitting rockets and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:32:19 its no longer a tank, its name is now, wonk
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:34:38 does rickje even know this is happening?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:36:42 tank no more, im now an arch to walk under.
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:38:00 yeah, how much do you bet rickje doesnt know whats happening right now
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:39:51 the patched the thing they wernt supposed to patch but were originally supposed to, its a tongue twister
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:41:33 *people start spamming they now like build a boat more*, just imagine
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:42:57 i dont think they have motor lock  issues there
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:44:04 pack your bags everyone, we might start migrating
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:46:01 theres only 1 thing to do in these trying times, go watch anime
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:47:39 i have a proposal for you guys, go watch some darling in the franxx or something and locked motors may be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:48:58 or boku no hero academia, kill la kill, date a live, death note. just some sort of anime and you'll be saved by it
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:50:16 its migrating season, all the tribes are going to this place called, build a boat for treasure?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:51:18 thats because we need to motor lock for that XD
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:52:19 <@!404632014189494293> atleast they didnt break locked motors(probably cause they dont have them) but you know what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:53:20 then lets cancel roblox <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:54:20 well i mean its more fun than having all your builds no longer work
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:56:31 <@!404632014189494293> do you wanna switch out all your motor lock towers with a new block?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:58:18 i mean it would just be nice if they atleast gave us a block that did the exact same thing but having to switch all of them out will be quite a pain
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 20:59:25 i mean war thunder is less pay to win...
