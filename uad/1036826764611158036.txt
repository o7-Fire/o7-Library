creations-chat 2023-05-15 15:14:11 yea its the same nose as his
creations-chat 2023-05-15 15:24:58 no his nose is actually accurate idk why people say its small
creations-chat 2023-05-15 15:58:19 i scrapped the eurofighter and im making a panivia tornado now, i got rid if the eurofighter cause i dont want to copy darknetwhites LOL
general 2023-05-15 17:01:48 i need jet suggestions

creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:35:12 i see teh sparklers now, i thought that it was a 1x1 half ball LOL
creations-chat 2023-05-15 17:37:33 whats the ratio of 179 to 32
creations-chat 2023-05-15 18:24:26 should i build an ah-64C or an F-4 phantom

i didnt give up i had the nose perfectly done i just didnt wanna copy dark
creations-chat 2023-05-15 19:52:19 building a yak-141 rn
creations-chat 2023-05-15 19:54:53 yes, my euro would have been but i scrapped it LOL, my f-14 is probably the best in the game fr tho

Best F-14 in the game not best build LMAO


my f-14 has less exposed motorlock than madvulpens and boxnesses and darknetwhites

plus darknetwhites f-14 is overscaled

(i also removed some more exposed motorlock)

yes it is, then what f-14 is better???
creations-chat 2023-05-15 19:56:56 there was two reasons i scrapped the eurofighter, 1 because i was practically copying darknetwhites and 2 the eurofighter is overrated in my opinion and i wanted to build somthing sleek and vtol
creations-chat 2023-05-15 19:59:48 nah the interior is way better its just that alot of the emojis are hidden from camera angle and also the glass is making it not visible'

the rio seat radar spins too

and the stick moves left right forward and backwards
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:02:26 i got rid of 6 exposed motorlocks since i posted it in the creations

it looks alot smoother now

theres only 2 motorlocks that i cant hide, 1 on each side

so if you ask me, its not bad

and there not too visible


then whos is better?
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:06:13 no way you said that, vulpens is straight ASS his newest one has got 0 interior and he has exposed motorlock too

plus he used such a basic livery

can i see your f-14?
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:09:40 not bad, only suggestion i have is add wing detail and make the wheel color like a 44 44 44 instead of 0 0 0

but still i see 2 exposed motorlocks which is the same amount as mine

they should make the configure tool so you can make parts invisible like babft
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:12:35 mine is 3 wide too?
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:14:37 1.5 blocks is not to tall LOLhttps://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1106643673233506314
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:17:13 thats the only thing i agree with
creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:22:05 best f-16 goes to this and its not even done

i already know dark got banned and this will never be finished

creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:28:06 your calling that the best??? its not even finished the front landing gear looks like crap why tf did he use a ladder for that

creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:31:19 alright im gonan put my yak off for a bit and try harder on my tomcat, because i did rush a bit near the end

creations-chat 2023-05-15 20:33:20 no actually the yak was turning out good ngl like fr

LOL

ok but be fair whats your thoughts so far? <@448677698773057547>
creations-chat 2023-05-16 01:57:44 nah not really, his nose is too small, his canopy is large, and you can see exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:03:57 he used his own scripted shader to add mountains, if he flew into the mountains it would just glitch through it, basically hes just flying in the void LOL
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:07:50 add more noses and rotate them so you have a cone shape and not a blocky nose cone

4 nose cones is a good amount

angle each of them at the same angle then turn them with a 2nd angle lock
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:23:22 this sucks bro its so huge, would be so good if it were roscale

my f-14 is better than this‚ò†Ô∏è 
theres like what? 20 angle locks at most???
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:26:12 bro the whole build is like 5:1 wdym???

(i hate any jet thats not roscale or mini)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:28:14 nah mini jets are nice because there useful for carriers since a roscale carrier is impossible till pc2

you cant say i dont have a point


how the fuck is that possible??? two person build???
creations-chat 2023-05-16 02:32:54 alright but not everyone has a MEGA CARRIER LMFAOOO

the biggest carrier you can build realisticly by yourself is 3 plots long

(without it being a pancake)
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:21:23 After reading this i have some things to point out, I removed 6 exposed motorlocks on the body and now the only exposed ones are on the wing tips, about the decals i should have redone the fold before taking pictures as i got a horrible fold and some decals were angle locked slightly into the nose and that was my mistake.

The size is perfectly to scale in length you just might be seeing it weirdly and the color im working on painting it a little darker grey but the blue is fine its not a custom paint its VF - 213, look it up if you must but i agree with the grey being too light.

Thanks for your feedback i appreciate it
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:23:34 Very nice work i like this f-15 allot
perfect scale id say if you finish this without any exposed motors it'd have a high chance at HoF
i like the spaceing between the intakes and the frame
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:25:42 Nah i was only hating on that F-4 phantom cause it was just fucking MASSIVE and for that scale there wasnt much sign detail mainly just dteail in the nose art LOL, its not a bad f-4 phantom i just dont like large jets

Like for example the sign detail is there its just tiny

He should have mixed in blocks and delta wings for detail
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:30:21 Heres what im talking about, the details I circled in red are way to small, Ways to fix it are by increasing sign text to 100 and using 1x3 instead of 1x2 signs and by using blocks and wing panels to add larger decals <@567763933952475157>
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:33:11 i fixed most of the looks chill out LOL
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:35:13 look here and read this these are the changes I made, One thing i did thats not mentioned here is add this curve on the jet nozzles <@903683435078516757>
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:38:22 Why are you in love with this F4 phantom? You trying to make out with it damn bro, its not even that good its fucking MASSIVE and the details are small the porportions are not there with detail, i could care less about there being no exposed motorlock


<@903683435078516757> after i finish painting it a darker grey ill take new photos calm down, it aint a big deal
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:41:44 there not "bad" everyone just got mad because i said there could be some changes done to some huge as fuck f-4

how can no one else tell that the porportions on that f-4 suck, look how small the decals are to the massive aircraft like fr

The signs on the vertical stabilizer look like your comparing a marble to a basketball
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:44:40 Nose art can be made with a roscale build too?
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:47:35 How the fuck is that better? the details are WAY TO FUCKING SMALL how is no one else noticing that literally look at the vertical stabilizer just look how small the fucking signs are compared to the build, i could care less about the f-14 rn im trying to help you realize that this f-4 phantom aint the shit, its just an ordinary jet.

Any good builder can make a jet with angled cylinders and no exposed motorlock. god damn bro
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:50:43 thats just rail attachments for pheonix missiles
talking about ladders on the bottom for rail attachments is crazy‚ò†Ô∏è
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:52:45 i tried skis ladders looked better ngl

Because i just thought about joining the server a couple days ago?? it dosnt mean i just joined plane crazy lol
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:55:07 No way you just compared a model with model stand attachments to a build
creations-chat 2023-05-16 14:58:19 quit dog shitting on my f-14 because i said someones f-4 phantom was overscaled and had underscaled decals LMFAOO
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:02:07 i have atleast 20 relpies on that message, calm down its not that deep LMFAO his scale is so horrible on that f-4 your all acting like your in love with it
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:22:32 exactly my point thank you, his signs are not in porportion with the rest of the build, the only decal on that f-4 that is in porportions is the nose art the rest are too small
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:34:06 thats because i just joined the server 6 days ago

i have 119days, 6hours, 26minutes on plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-16 15:37:30 Niceee

creations-chat 2023-05-16 17:40:28 well its that if i move the motorlock on the wingtip it has to have space to rotate for the wing sweep

creations-chat 2023-05-18 20:40:37 ngl morfix urs looks almost exactly like plats
Mainly in the tail area <@1004207882784489472>
creations-chat 2023-05-18 20:43:34 why not? my f-14 has 50+ angle locks and it  folds perfectly every time
i have a trick that makes folding work every time
no helium stoppers either

nah i just said morfixes looks like plats becasue of how the tail angles in on the sides of the engines
creations-chat 2023-05-18 20:47:00 no, you use 2 anchors, un-anchor one to do you motor 2 / piston stuff. then re-anchor it and hold down you angle keys for about 5 seconds then tap them 3 - 5 times without un-anchoring, after that un-canchor and then fold normally

It seems weird but it works every time idfk

(you can use phys anchor) <@448677698773057547>
creations-chat 2023-05-18 21:07:07 i counted. do you want to count??

No just join me in vip1

ill paint every angle lock bright yellow for you
creations-chat 2023-05-18 21:22:00 everything in bright yellow is an angle lock (some you cant see in the angle of the image) <@912065912658608190> <@986395564126134363>
