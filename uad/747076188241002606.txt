plane-crazy 2021-12-18 08:26:40 Magnet?
general 2021-12-25 23:35:02 hey where do you report someone that claims to be working for rickje?
general 2021-12-25 23:36:29 that place is closed
general 2021-12-25 23:38:04 ok
general 2021-12-25 23:38:55 i didnt dm him
general 2021-12-25 23:41:35 well they said in announcements to report them
general 2022-04-16 08:00:41 hey can somone tell me why the standard for good or at least decent PC builds posted in creations, is so extremely high?
general 2022-04-16 08:02:26 doesnt really motivate people to make something better, does it?
general 2022-04-16 08:03:29 wait
general 2022-04-16 08:03:35 wdym hall of fame?
general 2022-04-16 08:04:18 yes i know that
general 2022-04-16 08:04:19 but
general 2022-04-16 08:04:30 still
general 2022-04-16 08:05:44 about 60/100 builds posted in creations is like 50 score in the negatives
general 2022-04-16 08:05:58 and those arent even that bas
general 2022-04-16 08:06:00 bad
general 2022-04-16 08:06:59 really, imagine working for months on something you're really proud of, only for it to be downvoted into the ground cuz you dont have motorlocks in it
general 2022-04-16 08:07:51 that feeling sucks a lot
general 2022-04-16 08:08:58 thats the thing
general 2022-04-16 08:09:33 if you dont motorlock, about 70percent of people will downvote it
general 2022-04-16 08:09:40 no matter what
general 2022-04-16 08:11:51 and how large is that build?
general 2022-04-16 08:13:24 no motorlock you say?
general 2022-04-16 08:13:35 k
general 2022-04-16 08:14:01 let me re evaluate my life choices real quick
general 2022-04-16 08:14:49 i do kinda see a pattern
general 2022-04-16 08:15:13 either your build is extremely small and motorlocked, or big and complicated
general 2022-04-16 08:16:24 funi
general 2022-04-16 08:16:41 wait wdym outlines?
general 2022-04-16 08:16:55 oh
general 2022-04-16 08:17:01 why did they remove that
general 2022-04-16 08:17:35 well, yes, but while in buildmode its usefull
general 2022-04-16 08:17:37 cuz
general 2022-04-16 08:17:52 when you place blocks theyre automatically a solid white color
general 2022-04-16 08:18:03 so it is kinda hard to see stuff
general 2022-04-16 08:18:08 k
general 2022-04-16 08:18:49 that could work
general 2022-04-16 08:18:51 thnx
general 2022-04-16 08:19:44 how many people are actually in the 'elite' with one or more master rank/build in the HoF?
general 2022-04-16 08:20:38 wdym logical?
general 2022-04-16 08:21:17 that sucks
general 2022-04-16 08:21:35 tbh a lot of the people in this community are toxic
general 2022-04-16 08:21:52 huh
general 2022-04-16 08:22:24 not talking about the people in game, those are more amazing then a lot of people here i think
general 2022-04-16 08:23:00 look, i know that it shouldnt be easy to get in the HoF
general 2022-04-16 08:23:02 but
general 2022-04-16 08:23:33 thats not an excuse to have about every build except for like old HoF worthy builds to be downvoted into the ground
general 2022-04-16 08:24:20 cuz you have no motorloxk
general 2022-04-16 08:24:39 who?
general 2022-04-16 08:24:55 ah
general 2022-04-16 08:25:05 k

general 2022-04-16 08:27:39 jk
general 2022-04-16 08:28:20 do you think he might be the reason people are so toxic?
general 2022-04-16 08:28:29 ok

general 2022-04-19 09:34:16 why is there a slow mode in creations chat?
general 2022-04-19 09:35:15 to be fair i can see why
general 2022-04-19 09:35:17 cuz
general 2022-04-19 09:35:49 people really like to hate on peoples work if it isnt perfect for some reason

also why theres a slow mode here ig
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:44:19 btw what if you use disconnected disconnectors, that might make it even smaller : D
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:47:08 wait why do you guys even care? it looks cool, and if you're proud of it, thats that, no need to be all nitpicky, thats just ruining this entire community pretty much
creations-chat 2022-04-19 09:53:07 do you realize that you are pretty much the cause of this 'bs'
