general 2021-01-22 14:33:20 wtf
general 2021-01-22 14:33:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:11 am i the only one that thinks making a limit for pvp weapons per radius would make the game better?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:29 every time i see those white boxes made out of shredders and covered with missiles
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:32 thats not fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:35:28 i mean, probably a really big limit
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:35:50 oh thats not much
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:35:58 people have like 500 cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:01 in all sides
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:08 50 missiles or so
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:30 there is a limit?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:01 whats the limit for cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:12 oh wow
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:16 sorry didnt read
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:33 ok then i though making limits directlly would have controversy but yeah cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:39 cutters are the only problem then
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:51 200 max would be fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:30 yeah saw a lot of those
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:43 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:02 yeah i think that should be around the limit for cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:08 oh wow
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:24 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:43:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:43:08 really cool
creations-chat 2021-01-22 16:45:48 lmao, yeah
creations-chat 2021-01-22 16:59:46 emergency ejection
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:55:05 pov: you are really original
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 08:05:39 if something drops my fps , it better be good
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 08:06:12 also tutorials on an a game based on making your own stuff should only cover expansive arguments
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 08:06:16 like idk, how to make a boat
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 08:06:21 and then you expand that concept
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 08:06:34 or how to make a building fold for more lenght
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:29:21 
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:29:28 
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:29:32 awww, thats so cute
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:32:04 exactlly
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:32:17 the kids can be annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:32:34 but sometimes they just have these moments
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 11:33:08 lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:39:42 does anyone know about the map revamp? are they working on it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:39:46 i dont know much about it
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:40:29 hold on maybe i got confused
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:41:18 ok so
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:41:28 pretty sure the current map didnt chance since september?
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:41:45 other than the snow
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:41:50 and the lava zone
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:41:56 correct?
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:42:39 you cant
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:42:45 unless the other pilot does nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:43:24 if you sit on a pilot sit you control everything
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:43:25 so idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:43:35 the main pilot seat is where you get teleported though
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:23:56 thats not even a tank, all wheels are the same height, thats not a tank duh
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:24:02 motor2 fix when
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:24:40 thats weird
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:24:49 do they have custom keys?
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:24:56 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:25:11 yeah motor2's sometimes just do 360's forever
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:25:26 or if they are supporting too much weight they just go crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:25:36 thats why they are broken
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:25:45 i dont think its supposed to happen
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:30:17 wow so pretty
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 08:30:39 yeah you should make the car more long to balance things out
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 10:01:05 tank good
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 10:01:09 car bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 07:31:22 woah
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:30:08 by making this motorbike
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:30:25 i discovered that you can fly just with wheel turningg
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:30:28 and some wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:30:32 so i made a flying motorbike
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:31:07 i may have abused the system that makes planes fly idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:43:18 i probably should've posted this in creations
creations-chat 2021-07-04 21:46:20 how is that funny <:troll_sadge:834656667500937216>, its motorbike that has wings so it does really quirky and weird stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 21:47:43 oh im getting downvotes to oblivion, epic, yeah maybe doing nothing at all would've been even better
creations-chat 2021-07-04 21:48:40 <:throwing_hands_up:753816161719943248>  explain!!1
creations-chat 2021-07-04 21:51:38 i want to feedback for  my motorbike, but society wont tell me !11  ðŸ˜”
creations-chat 2021-07-04 21:54:01 ðŸ˜­
creations-chat 2021-07-04 21:59:07 yeah, a 2 wheel veihicle, whats the problem i dont get it
creations-chat 2021-07-04 22:01:18 yeah it is i guess, it has 2 wheels, 1 seat, and thats it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:53:16 can someone explain to me , what is wrong with this motorbike, i just dont understand, yes, its a really simple build, and may look ugly, but that still doesnt explain the downvotes, im just really puzzled
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:55:16 i got confused because people would say stuff like "what the fuck" "very funny", i though i'd made some weird reference, ok then thanks
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:59:52 its good ,i think it has downvotes just because you didnt paint it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 09:11:43 cry about it <a:trollfast:690076626427707407>
