plane-crazy 2020-06-03 19:58:28 nice
bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:10:33 There is this saving issue where when you paint glass to white, the colour doesn't save and the glass resets to this blue colour.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:10:57 This bug existed for a long time
bug-reports 2020-06-09 15:11:35 It's also triggering
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:16:20 Only some of the glass blocks save for me.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:17:04 Just to make sure i am not using legacy
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:10 So far i have experimented and found out it's the wegdes.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:25 1x1
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:20:38 and half wedge downs
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:21:10 By the war nice profile pic
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:21:15 way i meant
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:21:27 ...
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:21:32 well
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:21:40 some save and some don't
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:23:01 What does pogger mean?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:23:31 ...
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:23:44 ...
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:23:52 I thought this was bug reports
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:24:06 An emoji
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:24:50 well uhh
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:24:58 Ok?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:26:49 Well anyways I usually use the black paint for the glass on builds I use.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:26:57 But uhh
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:27:05 hold on
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:28:25 Could this help?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:28:38 Do you see what i mean now?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:28:58 let me know if you need me to show you the dev console
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:31:01 
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:31:20 Lots and lots of errors
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:32:25 Never happened to me
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:33:13 Must be a saving ussue
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:33:24 check if you have exceeded your max save data
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:33:52 hmm
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:37:22 I have no idea what the limit materials block is
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:39:03 In my time of playing plane crazy, the only thing that i can think of is the paint block
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:39:34 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:42:12 For what?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:43:53 For the glass saving issue it's usually the 1X1 wegde, the half wedge down and that's it.
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:45:43 place multiple wedges
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:45:53 
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:47:03 How many wedges did you place?
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:47:37 I believe there are 12 1X1 wedges on my build
bug-reports 2020-06-09 17:50:17 Anyways, I have to go now.
bug-reports 2020-06-10 17:06:56 Happened to me many times.
bug-reports 2020-06-10 17:07:15 The person who blacklist you must rejoin for it to fix.
