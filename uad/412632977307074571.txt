creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:37:40 i guess its just hate for no reason then... basically to throw others down like shredder bugs
creations-chat 2021-02-01 14:42:12 how the fuck is that thing receiving dislikes bruh, it doesn't even look bad (the tank i made)
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:06:10 i didnt downvote anyone, so i guess the 1st reason mabe, still 10 downvotes for a good loking build is shit taste
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:08:13 then dont downvote, if that is the only reason bruh, ive wasted my time in locking that up to be disliked like if it was a shit plane made by some noob in PC, thats not even fair
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:13:27 12 dislikes, literaly never got so much dislikes in a build, FANTASTIC, (fuck the pc comunity, seems they are broken today or something)
creations-chat 2021-02-01 15:44:27 would you guys mind not pinging me btw? the truth is that there has been too much disliking that is just for hate, theres literaly no reason to it. And im not listening to any counters rn because it is true

creations-chat 2021-03-09 17:21:52 no one said that, im saying they don't perform as well and lag more, didn't say we couldn't take them, and we actually don't mind including big ships in there.

And yes U.N.C.F. is a PC faction for spaceships, very well organized in different fleets
creations-chat 2021-03-09 17:24:39 Yes, for spaceships
creations-chat 2021-03-09 17:28:49 as long as it is a spaceship there's nothing more, there is recommended but nothing obligatory
creations-chat 2021-03-09 17:48:12 sure
creations-chat 2021-03-09 18:00:32 ^true, i was thinking that
creations-chat 2021-03-10 13:32:30 Yes, at least 4 people in the fleet have built the same, but these 3 were controlled by other ships , which is why it is called the A.I. fleet
creations-chat 2021-03-10 13:35:17 they are the Dreadnoughts A-21 A-22 and A-23, and Amaterasu AAAAS-7(advanced ability armament advanced stage)
the A- on the dreadnoughts is for Autonomous, and there are other series of them called Z and S, for Command and Special
creations-chat 2021-03-10 13:37:22 Its made of a tutorial of mine, which takes approximately 2 to 3 hours to build in 3 parts, 2 with half an hour and one with 15 minutes, we hope to multiply these ships and make enormous formations like the real ones
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:37:41 e
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:37:46 o
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:37:54 hello

plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:38:33 sure, you just need a spaceship to evolve on ranks, anything will do literally
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:42:58 depends

plane-crazy 2021-03-21 22:38:17 is there any way we can advertise plane crazy groups without being banned or something
creations-chat 2021-03-21 22:38:53 is there any way we can advertise plane crazy groups without being banned or something
general 2021-03-21 22:39:42 is there any way we can advertise plane crazy groups without being banned or something
general 2021-03-21 22:40:15 heloo
general 2021-03-21 22:40:41 is he even doing it
general 2021-03-21 22:40:55 oh so hes actualy recoding the Game?
general 2021-03-21 22:44:50 srsly why the fuck is even illegal to advertise plane crazy discord groups
general 2021-03-21 22:45:23 its not like if it was gona kill this server or anything like member stealing
general 2021-03-21 22:45:32 people only go if they want
general 2021-03-21 22:46:02 how is it annoying?
general 2021-03-21 22:47:31 reasonable, but not even being able to publish anything about it is kinda bruh
general 2021-03-21 22:47:44 the only way to grow is rly youtube
general 2021-03-21 22:49:22 like acc verification and some shit, but that didnt rly matter
general 2021-03-21 22:50:05 which means toxic mods who ban people for no reason sometimes
general 2021-03-21 22:50:07 lol
general 2021-03-21 22:50:30 ive had a friend of mine banned by posting the same picture 2 times
general 2021-03-21 22:50:38 does it sound reasonable?
general 2021-03-21 22:50:57 is repost even a crime
general 2021-03-21 23:02:56 thank you for informing.
creations-chat 2021-03-22 08:41:57 oh the Type 10

general 2021-04-27 18:59:13 ok and
general 2021-04-27 18:59:31 i dont mind being banned that much u know 😐
general 2021-04-27 19:01:30 I am not giving any server links so i dont think its that dangerous either way, my pfp is literally more dangerous than that
creations-chat 2021-05-03 00:29:23 https://tenor.com/view/lol-risitas-haha-laught-jaja-gif-14980367
creations-chat 2021-05-03 00:34:00 it feels so bad to wait an other week just to watch 20 minutes of it and then cry again the rest of the next week for it
creations-chat 2021-05-03 00:36:06 Yes XD, i rly wana read the whole manga now. In fact ima do it rn lol
general 2021-06-19 18:32:01 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:15:51 Sure its inspired of it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISYRq8K2cc0&t=306s
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:16:05 i see many elements which look just the same
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:17:06 i mean i personally did the tutorial like what, 4 moths ago?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:23:49 yes, i refered some elements looked just the same, not the way they reach their final form
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:24:03 basically
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:24:08 the main difference is
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:24:48 the way to get to the final product is different, in the tutorial i go for shaping with what the game gives me while in the lock he does parts separately
general 2021-09-01 03:45:10 can you import Plane Crazy Models from PC to Roblox Studio?
general 2021-09-01 03:45:33 would be cool tho
creations-chat 2022-04-07 08:50:56 Its UNCF because it belongs to a plane crazy faction, plus im not aware of any factions that are actually called UNSC, or inspired in that halo faction that are significantly powerful
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:08:40 there used to be quite large space factions during the early 2021 period, people lost motivation after some time because PC2 and lag not getting fixed and so it sadly kind of died out
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:15:33 but
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:15:57 (:(
general 2022-06-10 11:31:56 wait
general 2022-06-10 11:32:03 there are other spaceship groups?
general 2022-06-10 11:32:07 ALIVE?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:34:37 we decided to change the name because it was more practical
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 11:49:48 is there anything specifying what counts as advertising and what doesn't?
general 2022-07-17 20:48:27 What if rick made more leaks so good players stop quitting the game with 0 hopes of pc2 going out, every other roblox game in development gives leaks to leave people exited about it and motivated
general 2022-07-17 20:48:44 This is literally killing the community
general 2022-07-17 23:40:31 Its hard not to loose motivation when you wait 2 years for a single update, no update ever releases and is replaced by a new game, and you dont get to know anything avout that game and the devs still say its gona be paid
general 2022-07-17 23:40:55 Yea... dev
general 2022-07-17 23:42:07 Other games are constantly releasing leaks to motivate the ppl waiting for the game
general 2022-07-17 23:43:09 I understand rickje could be scared of overhyping ppl but
general 2022-07-17 23:43:20 Its better than killing the active community
general 2022-07-17 23:43:48 People quit because they lose hope that anything will change
general 2022-07-17 23:44:10 Bru im stupid thank you
general 2022-07-17 23:45:47 Thats at least how i feel...
general 2022-07-17 23:46:23 Some people dont even believe that PC2 will ever release anyway
general 2022-07-17 23:46:47 Because theres just barely any info about it
general 2022-07-17 23:47:30 Yes
general 2022-07-17 23:47:44 I dont get whats the point of keeping it all secret
general 2022-07-17 23:48:28 Wow its a military secret of some sort
general 2022-07-30 11:30:24 ~~rebranded terrible looking volkswagens~~
general 2022-07-30 11:31:18 tbh even peugeot looks more promissing, it doesnt even have a wing an peugeot managed to get it to work
general 2022-07-30 11:34:49 it looks goofy
general 2022-09-08 17:53:16 the queen is dead
general 2022-09-10 01:28:52 pc2 when
general 2022-09-10 01:29:39 pc2 sounding more secret than the stuff happening in the pentagon
general 2022-09-11 16:05:12 i wonder if there are still any star wars groups in plane crazy
general 2022-09-11 16:06:26 spaceship communities are practically gone
general 2022-09-11 16:06:39 there are but a few left that are at least publically known
general 2022-09-11 16:10:59 like spaceship groups in plane crazy
general 2022-09-11 16:11:05 i suppose most of them arent public
general 2022-09-11 16:12:09 o
general 2022-09-11 16:21:26 yes but like, groups with spaceship navies, with combat and stuff, there are few
general 2022-09-11 16:21:37 *tell me more*
