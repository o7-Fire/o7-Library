plane-crazy 2018-12-06 02:50:19 anyone have advice on how I can make a helicopter without putting a bunch of control surfaces on it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 02:58:49 i've been using them
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 02:59:26 I have to use control surfaces on the side to make it move at all to the sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 02:59:36 or up and down
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 03:02:05 if I don't use control surfaces it'll end up flying all around the place and flipping itself
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 03:02:32 but I don't want to use them since it'll make the helicopter look bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:18:05 how about making it so we can actually put half blocks under half wedges instead of there being a space under it
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:18:31 it's really annoying not being able to do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:20:37 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:22:37 rocket engine + block + main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:22:40 bam can fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:23:27 whole map x whole map ball
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:24:22 and thats for one hitbox?
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:47:19 uwo

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:51:40 "my final word in this server"
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 17:52:03 you have lied to us
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:43:08 anchored blocks work fine for me
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:44:59 use anything but the roblox recorder
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:45:40 are you pressing the button to unanchor it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:45:48 because it should already be anchored
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:46:29 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:48:08 it seems like it unanchors when you move the motor
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:48:17 i just tested it with a motor ingame
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:49:07 having more than one isnt the issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 18:49:19 mine won't keep anchored either when I move the motor

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 19:28:41 probably got unbanned in the staff chat by someone

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 19:29:13 goodbye
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 19:29:40 you can leave now
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 19:34:44 how is kevin not banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:33:59 does this count as speed of light?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:34:20 okay
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:34:32 that'll be hard then since it just randomly glitched out
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:42:45 oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:42:55 i thought he said I had to show how i did it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:45:29 okay I guess ill send it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:45:38 i literally just spammed suspensions on a vip server until I went flying
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:46:28 this "thing" sent me flying out of the map glitching
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:46:57 i agree
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:47:14 i went to a vip server because it'll end up lagging the game super bad
creations-chat 2018-12-07 02:14:36 my finished B-2 Spirit Bomber. it can reach around 400 speed.
