plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:34:51 and lighting
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:35:10 so shaders
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:36:12 what

plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:43:07 b
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:44:18 i was expecting something like fully functional gun or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 14:45:15 gmt+8
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:24:19 uhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:24:24 why is sparklers banned
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:24:56 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:25:39 motor 2 allowed?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:30:42 beam 1x7 is immune to cutter
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:30:44 m
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:31:48 i only use cutters for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:12 well like its not totally immune but the front is pretty strong against cutters
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:32 mechs
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:33:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:34:48 is it gonna be an ffa or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:07 idk tbh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:46 i already have an idea for the weapon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:51 i just need a good looking design
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:20 its just a sword
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:24 because mech
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:45 ima use an arm
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:41:04 since everyone is mostly going for spinners the top part is vulnerable
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:41:12 so like a sword or a spear would be good
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:58 go for speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:05:29 is angle locking allowed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:05:36 might be considered motorlocked armor
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:24 it kinda overlaps eachother by a bit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:08 a piston not allowed either
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:19 no piston locking
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:11:57 what the hell thats a behemoth compared to mine
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:18 mine is just 7x7
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:16:04 you could use the ladders to just stop the momentup
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:16:06 momentum
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:06 wait snow blasters arent in the rules
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:30:51 wait is snow blaster actually allowed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:50:00 dont put wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:50:03 use snow blaster
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:55:09 does layered armor mean blocks motorlocked into eachother or something like this
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:55:10 
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:57:04 it wont be on terrain prob
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:57:10 because suspension isnt allowed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:57:19 why tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 07:28:22 can we glitch other people's motors
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 07:28:41 oh wait no glitches
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 07:34:10 im surprised dababy isnt in <#917397949938548736> yet

general 2021-12-08 07:49:45 and above max cutter
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 08:36:19 just a suggestion but instead of 4 max ballast maybe make the total amount of ballast weight as 40
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 11:44:41 i used 8 ballast
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 11:44:49 but the max weight is 38
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 11:44:53 is that fine
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 11:45:04 max you get from 4 ballast is 40
