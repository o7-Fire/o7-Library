plane-crazy 2022-11-27 09:42:47 Winter I think
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 09:42:53 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 09:43:11 hmm. Not So Much.
plane-crazy 2022-11-27 09:44:03 Compelling argument.
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 21:10:15 I tried to make an arsenal bird so long ago.... Did not work out üò¶
general 2022-11-28 21:20:23 insane plane crazy skills
general 2022-11-28 21:54:56 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
general 2022-11-28 21:55:58 God I call upon your might, smite this twink immediately.
general 2022-11-28 21:56:50 Wdym?
general 2022-11-28 21:58:00 Equivocally what I'm saying
general 2022-11-28 21:59:55 Natural balance.

plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:15:16 Does the "Engine power alone rule" for the mad scientist/crazy scientist ranks mean you can't use wings either?
general 2022-11-28 22:15:55 Report this man immediately
general 2022-11-28 22:17:26 just joking <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:24:35 you have a nuclear reactor in the shape of a laptop
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:57:23 
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:57:35 So does rule 5 exclude air-brakes from being used?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:58:27 Are you able to use wings for turning/stablizing?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:59:47 
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 22:59:53 thats the design I had lol, think they'd allow it?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:00:27 mad scientist
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:01:00 interesting
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:01:48 so they self landed with air brakes?
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:02:41 cool üëç that was my plan with this, thought "engine power alone" would ban doing that though
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:03:14 God does not smile upon your creation üôè
plane-crazy 2022-11-28 23:05:51 Ah I see, ty üëç
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 00:02:55 all 3 landed

plane-crazy 2022-11-30 05:58:09 gonna try to make an aircraft that flies using only this mechanism for thrust
contest-chat 2022-11-30 06:05:08 do those wings generate actual thrust?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:11:32 the Mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:15:05 I will
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:15:10 It'll be ghibli inspired
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:15:22 Like the warship/zeppelin thing that flew over the field in howls castle
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:15:58 hopefully it'll be less goofy once implimented..
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 06:18:16 unfortunately it's manually puppeteered, but holding the e key extends the pistons and rotates the servo motors at the same time pushing it forward, but the servos are faster than the pistons so when you let go they revert to the default angle and don't push it back when the pistons go back down.
creations-chat 2022-11-30 15:56:48 did I post an ornithopter?
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 16:55:24 Doing it this way just because I find it interesting
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 20:00:49 
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 20:01:05 another weird thrust mechanism for the ship I want to make
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 21:28:49 Interesting
general 2022-11-30 22:26:31 what rank unlocks the private servers? I forgot
general 2022-11-30 22:27:07 lies.

plane-crazy 2022-12-01 18:48:07 jellyfish monster
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 18:48:32 I don't think it's gonna be possible to make it fly without helium using only the jellyfish mechanism unfortunately
general 2022-12-01 18:57:05 
general 2022-12-01 19:00:34 It made me into an anime girl
general 2022-12-01 19:24:16 mitosis
general 2022-12-01 19:30:17 sent it back in time
general 2022-12-01 21:30:44 terrifying beast
creations-chat 2022-12-02 01:34:01 first jet so far, have never made one before for some reasn
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 23:00:52 are all the VIP servers down?
bot-central 2022-12-02 23:01:54 -servers

creations-chat 2022-12-03 01:42:25 
general 2022-12-03 01:43:16 doesn't seem so stealthy to me tbh.... just get some Guys and have them look at the sky to make sure its not comin
creations-chat 2022-12-03 01:59:29 inspired by some random plane-thing I saw docked on the bottom of a blimp in a ghibli film
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:03:45 yea upvote/downvote seems to be..... inconsistent.
general 2022-12-03 03:08:43 how is -servers working for you? everytime I use the command the links I get don't work lol
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:28:01 <@297120728342331392> interested in the function that was built for, looks really interesting
creations-chat 2022-12-03 03:38:57 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 22:19:10 Why does my rotation-lock spazz out? how do I prevent that lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 22:21:31 just does this and spazzes everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 22:25:09 which one? the one that rotates?
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 22:25:43 Ah, yeah, that was my problem. Thanks!
creations-chat 2022-12-04 00:14:37 Intentional haha
creations-chat 2022-12-04 00:41:13 I like it. Mostly clean, I think most people would take off for the exposed motorlocks on the wings though. Could use triangle wedges to smooth out some parts aswell but overall very nice
