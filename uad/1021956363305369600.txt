general 2023-03-20 19:41:31 its basically just repeated multiplication <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2023-03-20 19:42:01 for example 2^5 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

general 2023-03-21 23:20:33 wtf is up with plane crazy now
general 2023-03-22 00:12:16 this fucking game
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 00:54:04 ah yes
general 2023-03-22 02:10:21 this is an example of the slippery slope fallacy
general 2023-03-22 02:10:31 life isnt a chain of dominos you know
general 2023-03-22 02:10:40 lets say that theres gonna be
general 2023-03-22 02:10:41 hmm
general 2023-03-22 02:11:17 50 steps to having a world that is entirely digital
general 2023-03-22 02:11:36 and theres a 90% chance that each step leads to another
general 2023-03-22 02:12:16 the probability that 1 leads to 2 that 2 leads to 3 that 3 leads to 4 and so on is only 45%
general 2023-03-22 02:12:20 (50 x 0.90)
general 2023-03-22 02:12:32 and lets give it a more likely probability
general 2023-03-22 02:12:35 lets say
general 2023-03-22 02:12:43 65%
general 2023-03-22 02:12:48 still kinda high though
general 2023-03-22 02:13:30 the probability this time is only a disappointing 32% chance of a world being entirely digital
general 2023-03-22 02:13:43 so you see life is not a chain of dominos or a slippery slope
general 2023-03-22 23:40:05 stfu jax
general 2023-03-22 23:40:35 didn’t bro say he was 64 one time
