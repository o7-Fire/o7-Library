Made a crappy helicopter that is highly unstable 
And made a NOT so crappy B 29 with a oversized turret on it

plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:34:49 Impossible
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:39:01 This game has too many wedges ahhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:39:30 I’m a noob so it feels like too many wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:39:46 After all I just started playing yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:40:22 Huh that’s what my B-29 is missing wow
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 12:41:37 I think wedges would be better if the outline is not just cubic and actually what part is collidable
