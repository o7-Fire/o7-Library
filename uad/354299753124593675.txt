creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:01:53 i
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:02:20 i made it the way it is, its not a sr 71.
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:02:38 the way i want my plane to look, is purely self preference
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:03:00 and the fact that you went and posted a picture of my plane to ask what others think about it, only proves your insecurities
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:03:16 i wouldnt call it bullying
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:03:18 X D
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:03:25 just a agree to disagree argument
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:03:47 you guys think my plane is ugly, thats fine. i wouldnt change a think about it to be honest
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:04:02 but yet, i think everything you made sucks aswell, so i guess it evens out
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:04:24 correcting someones typos only comes to show that you have nothing logical to say
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:04:49 you must really have nothing better to do than care about the way my plane looks and even go as far to correct my typos
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:04:57 pathetic really...
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:05:21 im focusing on everything we are arguing about
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:05:38 my whole argument from the beginning was "why do you even care"
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:06:07 well, thats your own personal opinion
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:06:26 arguing about the way my plane looks is like arguing about the way someones hair is styled
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:06:32 its completely self preference
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:07:26 yeah, they posted a picture of my plane on the disc chat, and basically was asking for critizism
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:07:33 i really dont care
creations-chat 2019-11-18 21:07:48 but i just think its funny how much this person cares about the way i built something
