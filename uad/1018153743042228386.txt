plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:04:19 the main lobby of my wtc is only 7 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:04:34 i wanna add as much as possible
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:04:41 possibly do roleplays and all that
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:05:23 i will probably use emergancy radio / voice announcement
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:05:36 i did that with an old wtc i made and deleted
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:06:39 does the voice go like ' there has been an emergancy reported in the building , please leave the building using marked stairwells and exits '
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 18:06:43 something like that
