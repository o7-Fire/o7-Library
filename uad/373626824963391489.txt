plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:48:07 except 2/3rd of the wings are flaps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:49:27 im 14
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:49:57 <13's who play roblox are always dumbasses

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:59:25 where do i see other people's builds? is there a channel for it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:59:33 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:59:35 shit i found it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:59:39 hi
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 00:59:47 i saw rick typing
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:00:23 rick when i make custom flaps using motors theyll work as bloody air brakes when they exceed like 30 degrees angle
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:00:31 u cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:00:52 u cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:01:05 big cool
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:02:44 the people here are actually pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:03:00 my planes turn into trash when i put flaps on them so they work
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:03:15 <@!249373398612967441> who that
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:03:45 is eistle like some cult leader
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:03:50 am i gonna get sacrificed to some god
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:18:24 yesss
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:18:33 it flies 100% stable at 600+ speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:18:38 epcicc
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:20:00 wth is magnet drive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:20:12 im hella noob
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:20:42 this is my shite plane it go very fast
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:09 as i said, 2/3rd of the wings are flaps xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:14 yes its the typhoon
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:15 thx
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:22:07 the shape looks sexy but a bit off
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:22:34 i didnt add an air intake as it didnt benefit me at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:22:42 bullyawiwe
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:22:59 go clap yerself
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:23:10 get span!1!!!!11!!!11
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:25:40 i think rick and mad should add a ''share block'' or ''team'' system so you can actually physically help people on their builds
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:25:55 theres a good bit of stuff the generic tutorial doesnt teach you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:26:06 i just joined comrade
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:26:12 epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:27:28 fungamer you are my friend already
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:27:35 omg yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:27:41 t-34 hella sexy
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:27:45 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:28:43 oh hi cult leader
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:28:57 when am i gonna be cooked for an ancient god
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:29:30 let me get one of my friends talking here
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:29:38 <@!264914511939502081> talk now or too skinny
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:34:48 is it a good idea if i add two miniguns on this thing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:01 they dont really do much but innacurately spray bullets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:19 what i meant wasnt even really a minigun
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:29 what i meant was a motor with guns on it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:50 miniguns only fire out of one barrel
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:59 the barrels turn so they dont ovehreat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:25 im not sure if this thing is maneuvrable enough for an average dogfight
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:37 rockets are good against ground units
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:43 you can make custom rockets that go faster but theyre massive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:00 exa thats probably gonna traumatize the server lagwise
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:21 atleast if you rapidfire them
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:44 well sucks to be the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:44:35 holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:44:40 you can see through water if u look through glass
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:45:00 subs are gonna die too
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:45:18 i never flew near water in first person lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:47:24 dont bombs explode on water irl too?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:47:29 it has more impact than you think
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:11 this looks epic right
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:18 the blue block is kinda ehhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:43 let me change the blue block to black
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:49:03 i also just realised two large rockets werent on
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:50:17 i painted whole enterior black
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:55:44 people who play with infinite fuel disabled are epic 😎
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:56:25 i probably should enable infinite fuel cuz i already can barely get a plane flying properly and now i have to worry about fuel too
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:56:42 for jet fighters i always aim towards a minimum of 16000 fuel
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:03 infinite fuel makes it less immersive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:09 wanna see my engine mate?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:19 just make your whole entire plane frames out of fuel blocks like i did
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:55 these big rockets are just for detail
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:59:03 the whole thing is filled with either fuel or super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:59:59 well you see
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:20 wait you mean the tail or the massive wings?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:32 main wing is massive wings right
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:59 in case you mean those, **you see it would not fucking fly up or roll**
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:01:07 **so i had to turn the wings into a whole pile o flaps**
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:01:49 why the hell would i put a propeller engine on a typhoon xd?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:19 id rather boatload it with rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:37 ill try it on the next fighter jet ill make tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:38 thx
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:49 i just accidentally said thx to an insult
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:50 get span
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:03:29 dm me something epic u made <@!249373398612967441>
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:35 well you see
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:44 i am fucking terrible at this game
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:59 i mocked irl jets because i feel like theyre frames are good and aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:04 my small jets are failures
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:18 bigger designs are always stable at high speeds
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:43 i mean when it goes like 320 block+
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:13 <@!249373398612967441> local fucking madman
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:18 thats epic as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:48 that plane is blyatiful
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:58 please tell me i wont get warned for saying blyat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:07:25 this plane is decently fast
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:00 it can pound the base ''runway'' at 560 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:15 kommerad
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:21 you have to teach me ur ways of small planes
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:29 i have never made a stable small plane before
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:38 im horrible
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:51 mine go unstable at 400 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:22 also what i said in dm was false alarm
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:28 it tops horizontally at 590 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:59 but its still 100% stable at that speed tho so im fine with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:10 any small plane that goes that fast will spaz
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:19 is that epic baguette plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:46 wait let me see how fast the typhoon goes in a dive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:51 shit i just left
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:53 ill join you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:38 kommerad from what country are you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:52 im from the netherlands so technically i am western but you see the netherlands is the good western
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:58 so i can still be slavic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:15:46 <@263770097288609794> yer a legend
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:02 i should probably stop pinging people this often when theyre just in chat xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:06 also np
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:27 **@**vipEmpire#3843 hello comrade

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:17:15 that was my master plan all along
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:17:48 the american flag is similar to a chess board so i approve of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:18:04 you see thats why russian flag and polish-lithuanian commonwealth flag are most epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:18:43 hope not
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:19:27 then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:19:33 the netherlands is epic 😎
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:04 perfect if you ask me
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:21 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:47 i think that would make blocks alot more laggier
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:21:15 you mean a bomber bombing FOR anime, or BOMBING anime?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:21:21 if its bombing anime ill join in
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:23:33 <@!427466925275217931> friend me on roblox cuz ''fungam'' gets censored in the search bar
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:23:56 i did
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:13 but anything with ''fungam'' in it gets censored
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:19 and there are millions of names with fun in it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:43 there are a couple thousand names with funga in it

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:13 or chat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:33 all remote and slight ''hatred'' should just get censored
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:43 they should only be allowed to say very few things
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:15:16 im from late 2015 and i dont remember this feature
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:17:19 im pretty sure wayyyyy back in the day there wasnt a filter at all

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:08 apart from 69
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:35 they should censor fungam too

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:19:26 their brainc apacity cannot fathem that

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:21:58 they should censor spaces too then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:22:20 they should add a 50 second cooldown then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:23:30 why do lovely kids keep leaving every pvp server after 3 minutes

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:23:02 in the finished product yes, but it can be a real pain in the ass when building things
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:23:58 im making a mig-29 and it looks very very similar to the one on yt
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:24:02 unironically
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:25:51 epic
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:26:24 mine is almost plot sized so the huge rockets are too small

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:56:51 war thunder is epicest game
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:57:18 You are bad in tanks in general

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:58:02 ye jaw
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:58:05 span
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:59:19 i like war thunder tanks most mainly because of kill/damaging system
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:00:00 in my opinion its not better its just different in a way that i enjoy it more
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:08:26 when i get a new pc its gonna have an i5 (forgot which gen but 9th i think or something), 500gb ssd, and idk wtf the graphics card was but its a big improvement from what i have now
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:08:34 what i have now is utter trash
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:09:03 its like 400 euroes
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:09:45 i dont think i need an i7 to run war thunder and roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:10:16 and im pretty sure an i7 thats better than a 9th gen i5 is expensive as shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:10:52 my budget is not big
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:11:03 if its like 250+ then eat my ass
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:11:23 my budget is only 600

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:13:01 its mid range i think
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:13:50 idk if i can find it
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:14:11 then itll be out of budget
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:14:16 my budget is 600
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:14:32 with this pc and the monitor it will rack up to like 580 euroes i think

plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:06:25 ok im gamble then]
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:06:37 ok its a yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:07:39 1000
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:07:56 25x40 is 1000
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:08:16 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:08:19 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:08:22 get calculator
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:08:32 like 4000
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:08:35 a little less than 4k
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:09:24 my drone can handle like 15 blocks of 10 density before the rotors break when trying to lift off
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:09:41 basically the wings on the rotor turning too far and it wont lift off
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:10:01 what glider
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:10:37 you cant really glide very fast i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:11:01 just make a normal plane i dont see why youd want a glider
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:20:30 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:21:39 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:21:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:23:51 he did not have the brain capacity to figure out that the plot was too short before he was half way finished
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:25:11 you big smart
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:25:36 yes is yes ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:26:15 do i deserve to be accused of being underaged everytime i insincerely and sarcastically act retarded for no real reason
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:26:51 yes russia is out of materials
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:28:59 who is bent
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:29:35 xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:32:16 so pro
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:37:27 why is that car so sophisticated
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:37:55 g-force physics are garbage
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:38:05 they dont decrease your bloodflow and kill you
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:38:37 dont the amount of motors on that slow down the thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:38:41 because of physics lag or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:10 teach me how to make!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:13 kidding
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:14 dont
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:33 im working on a radical tank with a fridge turret like the kv2
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:42 i figured
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:50 i would try to make my own version
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:39:54 i dont like copying stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:40:09 yes yes it big pro
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:40:24 you have a yt channel?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:40:27 whats the name i want see
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:40:39 i meant neutron
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:16 oh youre memexify
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:18 i am unfamiliar
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:21 let me check it out
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:39 fabric material gives u more traction?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:51 i thought just the fucking fiction block oh shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:41:55 let me edit the tank then
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:42:03 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:42:26 i have 26 suspensions in my tank making it go realistically only like 40 speed even though on the spedometer it says 180
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:42:58 what does that do
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:43:04 i did ctrlshiftf4 and did nothing
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:43:28 i was forced to give it an upvote but ive seen alot better blackbirds
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:43:33 but it looks better than the one on yt i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:44:00 i forgot wtf a gyroscope is
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:44:05 since im an absolute moron
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:44:51 so his all axis moving car has gyroscope chassis
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:02 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:11 gyroscope chassis
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:13 invent now
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:29 n
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:40 oh those things
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:48 that looks way more sophisticated than it should be i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:46:08 that shape looks cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:04 i made this yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:07 mig-25
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:21 cockpit is a bit shitty but the rest is decent i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:49 you asked us to rate your blackbird destined
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:48:54 i think the front is bad because theres no longer wedges and he didnt want to make it bigger so he has to use a single wedge for the shape
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:21 ok bye
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:28 good riddance love you nohomo
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:41 dont check logs pls
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:52 good
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:14 danny you is cool mod
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:34 that was terrible grammar on purpose i dont know why i do it all the time
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:47 like its just permanently inked into my brain to use bad grammar
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:56 nobody finds it funny
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:51:01 help me pls
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:52:19 here is my la-174
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:52:41 the front looks dodgy as hell though but i have no clue how to fix that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:07 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:31 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:32 that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:38 i thought it would aim better for first person
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:43 but the first person view is shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:48 but im too lazy to remove it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:54:38 it has air intake in front
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:55:18 danny is too cool to be pinged for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:02:48 <@351809528209080324> what do you think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:02:59 i think the cockpit needs to be better and the rudder needs to be bigger
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:03:08 and it needs that thing at the bottom at the rear end
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:03:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:34 the aerodynamics arent very advanced at all, there barely is any ''aerodynamics''
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:40 maybe rick will improve it in the future im not sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:47 that will be hard as hell to script though i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:51 since its really complicated
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:05:13 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:05:25 i was scared he removed the previous ones but he didnt luckily
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:06:30 im not sure if i should edit the la-174 or make a very cool spitfire
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:07:06 that will probably be too slow to fly because of physics lag after i add so many motors and moving parts
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:01 xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:35 tghat looked like russians surrounding the germans in wwII
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:52 wdym shuya
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:09:07 im pretty sure light grey is good if you wanna blend in day and night
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:10:58 whats wrong with reset mode
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:21 like 79
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:36 wait no i think less than 70
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:47 it was something and 9
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:12:27 somebody make ekrano plan already
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:12:40 kraken eating ekrano plan
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:18 wait actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:22 jellyfish
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:25 i might try that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:28 sounds cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:44 feel like itll be buggy as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:33 im gonna watch videos on jellyfish swimming and then im gonna try making one yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:39 yes i get alot of upvotes with it yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:53 wait how to get inventor
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:03 you have to make a new mechanism?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:08 what mechanisms havent been tried yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:28 im not sure if a jellyfish is a mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:01 has anybody made a working clock before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:11 ok give me a sec i try
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:50 wait does the minutes and hours need to be accurate because then i need to spend hours purely testing and tweaking a mechanism that probably already works i just need to edit the speed of the motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:01 if so then im not gonna try it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:29 ok i make communist jellyfish
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:35 ive tried making artillery
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:39 twice
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:07 the tnt doesnt explode if you shoot them using magnets and i dont wanna use rockets because thats not how artillery works
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:12 railgun artillery is use magnets yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:34 my grammer is big yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:56 havent loads of people made gustav before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:19 no railgun artillery doesnt exist but its basically just a railgun
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:26 but with explosive shells
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:36 yes!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:53 you place a magnet and click a key!! so unique mechanism!!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:20:32 has anybody ever tried making an extremely laggy magnet drive submarine before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:01 i dont think anybody has ever made an artillery cannon that benefitted you in pvp before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:44 tnt should make sound
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:49 its really anticlimactic right now
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:23:09 has anybody ever made a working zeppelin before using only rotors to fly
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:23:31 wow you must be fuming
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:25:56 people who use rockets for cars instead of making them move using just actualy wheels and motorized wheels are a disgrace
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:07 i doubt it has bad steering
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:14 it probably is just slow because of the lag
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:54 sad
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:28 that should just be the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:33 right there
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:41 nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:30:06 this chasis is really bad and generic and i put too many suspensions should i remove some to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:30:50 no not really
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:31:12 understandable
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:20 hahahhaa
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:24 hahahHBAHAHAHAHAH
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:32 commit neck rope GHAHAHHA
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:33:25 arent these shitty commit jokes like 4 months old
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:53:44 im gonna make fridge turret and put magnets in it and clap shells into people at 3000 speed to fling them
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:17 is fv4005 a polish tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:22 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:29 polish tanks look good though
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:43 oh you mean that kv2 v2
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:48 yues that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:54 that kills is-7
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:11 no is-7 is cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:12 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:16 irl it cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:35 lets start petition to have polish vehicles added to wt
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:57 wait are there polish tanks in wot
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:56:31 i like it because of the killing system
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:56:37 its more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:57:37 will this connect
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:57:47 to base or moving part
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:16 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:27 i have no clue how good an a-10 is
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:35 but i know big-25 has some sexy ass air intakes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:55 why did i say fucking big
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:59 why am i so fucking stupid
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:59:10 ok for the record i meant mig
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:59:43 the mig-25 frame breaks when going mach-3+ for more than 5 minutes xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:00:12 i think a-10 can penetrate mig-25 pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:00:24 but mig-25 can still clap the a-10 as well
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:01:31 arent all modern fighter jets supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:01:57 so they all have bad armour and cant rely on it at all
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:02:33 why cant they commit soviet heavy tank in wt that has 400m armor and still is fast
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:03:10 i faked my birth date too when making my accounts but im actually 14 and almost 15 😎
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:03:31 plastic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:04:51 i think speed completely replaces the purpose of armor
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:04:55 since it slows down plane
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:05:52 canada have better military than usa you ssee yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:06:12 flayer are you american
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:06:55 xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:18 i have no clue if canada has a good military or not i was saying it as a joke
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:35 ww2 planes are propeller engines
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:58 i think jet engine aircrafts were post ww2
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:30 they didnt go supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:49 i have 83 subs and no videos
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:57 me big flex on you! me pro!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:12 that was sarcastic and really funny no questions
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:50 me too
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:52 so gamering
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:02 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:06 oh i cant do that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:10 i get better pc soon
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:26 my pc right now is probably the worst in this server]
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:32 i run plane crazy 8 graphics 26 fps
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:42 i99 exist yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:19 did you find an entirely new pc in area 51
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:29 no motherboard can handles thatr
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:49 proo
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:55 my motherboard is that alien mothership
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:12:35 that doesnt look futuristic that just looks like a drone that realistically doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:14:25 ijn fuso big pro
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:14:48 the superstructure that was already big as hell is now also oversize on that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:15:02 lovely isnt it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:15:43 irl its probably like 50m tall yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 17:34:49 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:30 the new control surfaces are in my opinion trash
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:43 i had expected like something similar to the alreadye xisting delta wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:51 but its not even close to that
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:31:57 that looks like good old soviet is-3
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:09:00 what does rick mean with server lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:09:53 i only know three types of lag ping physics lag and the lag you get when spamming too much of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:43:36 do 15 year olds capitalise "xd"
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:09 in which vc can i do livestream with friend
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:18 i am making cool su-35 with thrust vectoring ok yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:32:14 no i mean so other people can watch too
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:32:23 but the friend is contributing in my server
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:08 robo
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:14 can i livestream in the holy shrine yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:21 ok pro
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:28 guys watch my livestream to see construction of cool plane yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:37 hi cooly
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:23:33 how many blocks does a helium beam lift
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:24:03 i mean like
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:24:07 how many units of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:26:28 ok i tested it and its about 38 stacked blocks that a beam can lift
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:26:59 can i join in
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:29:57 the aerodynamics arent that advanced though
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:30:37 i have no idea how to make working aerodynamics in a roblox game but he could make it act on normal blocks too
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:08 also rick is god for making the thing in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:30 he actually listens to what the community wants unlike most other roblox devs
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:47 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:34:03 i accept defeat
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:35:07 im working on big ugly chunky zeppelin thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:35:49 i need to make it functional first
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:36:27 im working on internal rotors to make it turn, go up and down, and forward and backward
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:36:38 not very original i know but yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:39:14 neutronium using affective magnet engines on a 3700+ block build is gonna make it 60 times as laggy as it already is i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:40:10 im gonna go for helium and rotors for now
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:40:17 if it doesnt work i will fit magnet engines in it
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:41:58 when my zeppelin thing is finished it will weigh almost nothing after i add around 102 helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:41:59 cool cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:27 he is fuming
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:34 hes idle
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:45 which word
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:43:07 do you mean ''uwu''
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:53:46 avatar page is unavailable what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:54:12 roblox is so shit i swear to god
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:11 turret fortresses will be even better when this new update drops
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:16 cant wait yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:32 its good for motorized flaps too
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:08:47 i cant wait till the motor update drops
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:08:58 it will make stabilizers much more immersive
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:09:06 and useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:09:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:14:18 <@456226577798135808> sorry for ping but can you send me link to testing server
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:15:12 thx
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:26:29 what was wrong with the camera
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:27:13 yeas
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:27:44 i wanna tell rick to fix something but i dont know how to explain it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:28:15 you know how like when you for example mount a mouse controled turret onto your plane and when you hover your cursor over the plane itself the turret will aim at the plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:28:21 which is annoying
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:31:19 whats datacost
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:31:31 do you mean how much save data a save uses
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:33:44 i have no idea what any of the things rick just said mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:35:00 pro
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:40 wait rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:20 can you make an option for the motor so that it doesnt aim at your own blocks when you hover your cursor over them its really annoying sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:00 rick can this be considered yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:32 i know but what if its optional
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:23 rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:28 are aerodynamics ever gonna be improved
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:35 maybe to act on normal blocks too
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:46 he told me he fixed it already for new servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:11 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:22 <@351809528209080324> pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:32 but realistic aerodynamics too complicated
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:52 makes it like a normal motor but with reset mode
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:34 <@!221487880487436288> wdym
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:39 i have maxangle option without servo too
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:50 fuming
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:45 i thought he fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:48 fuming

plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:16:28 itd be epic if it were added but itd fiercly decrease credibility or whatever the word is
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 23:16:48 but still pls add

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:26:45 help
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:27:17 i made a missile but when it goes up full power its stable but when it goes down with engine off presumably at less speed it wobbles really badly beyond recovery
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:28:08 can someone help me im clueless yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:28:42 i tried putting ballast at the rear end already but it didnt really make a difference
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:28:50 keybind
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:28:58 mouse doesnt work with camera view for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:29:51 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:30:22 i can not at all make a good pic of it but this is it in my sloppy submarine
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:30:28 ive changed the wing designs a couple times
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:03 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:07 9 blocks tall with weird wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:17 they didnt help so i might change them back to normal wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:32 basically removing the 1x2 deltas
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:32:34 delta surfaces wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:01 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:15 basically i should make prototypes before straight up making them inside the sub
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:28 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:03:39 tutorials are ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:04:06 its just bent when you state that you invented something you got from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:04:24 i dont copy tutorials unless i wanna modify and give them steroids
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:14:22 what ship is that
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 21:15:03 runway color is a bit weird
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:36:47 superstrength made my magnet drive plane slower
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:36:55 explanation pls
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:39:05 ice is slippery and fabric has more grip
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:39:15 those are the only textures with additional features i think
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:40:02 maybe your pc isnt that good and textures make you lag a bit
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:40:04 idk
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:40:09 you probably know more than me
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:41:28 i still dont know what an i9 would be used for
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:41:36 what do you do with a pc that requires an i9
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:41:48 oh
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:41:57 ok
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:42:55 also what do the performance improvements help with
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:43:05 i have never noticed any performance improvements
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:43:41 oh my fuck that ship is nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:44:05 i havent seen many ships
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:44:25 i dont check in the disc that much i just play the game and make what i wanna make
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:44:40 i wanna rebuild my voc ship now
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:47:53 i should probably check these creations more
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:48:08 tomorrow i rebuild my voc ship
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 12:27:52 when can i play plane crazy again

bug-reports 2019-10-17 19:28:35 i was trying to make a slapping contest mech arm but i cant because of this
bug-reports 2019-10-17 19:28:37 plssss fix
bug-reports 2019-10-17 19:29:18 without the massive ballast beam it will completely spaz out and get bent
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 19:35:15 has the bug where the motor2 wont top 1 speed been reported before?
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 19:35:29 no matter to what speed i adjust it too it stays slow as hell

plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:52:25 you see when they mass produced the t-34's they were often missing parts and in some places deformed
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:52:28 this is one of them
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 19:00:23 gonna overhaul the turret on my bent t-34

plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:00:01 what are you guys talking about

plane-crazy 2019-11-29 17:02:19 wait why are we talking about this in the plane crazy channel
general 2019-11-29 17:03:45 <@!350584348384428036> i suggest you get the other t-34's then
general 2019-11-29 17:03:59 i have a t-34 1942 and its good
general 2019-11-29 17:06:11 i get around 3 kills a match with it
general 2019-11-29 17:06:27 but thats mostly because i try to flank the enemies like a moron and end up having to shoot pointblank
general 2019-11-29 17:07:32 rangefinder can be helpful but its bad when the enemy youre aiming at is on the move
general 2019-11-29 17:07:42 i always try aiming for the side of the turret
general 2019-11-29 17:08:02 or the general side of the tank if its not gonna bounce my shell
general 2019-11-29 17:08:20 so i can bend the engine or blow up ammunition
general 2019-11-29 17:09:57 noooo

plane-crazy 2020-03-19 13:38:30 so pro
general 2020-04-01 18:23:30 hi rap

general 2020-04-01 18:25:19 he isnt muted
general 2020-04-01 18:25:31 how what
general 2020-04-01 18:36:39 is the creations bot self hosted
general 2020-04-01 18:36:41 or public
general 2020-04-01 18:37:15 great answer
general 2020-04-01 18:37:16 so useful
general 2020-04-01 18:37:33 ok
general 2020-04-01 18:39:12 pro
general 2020-04-26 16:34:09 have ways to improve guns and make fighting in planes more decisive and fun already been suggested alot of times?
general 2020-04-26 16:38:51 i cant use fireworks when going over like 20 speed is that supposed to happen
general 2020-04-26 16:39:16 wait this isnt plane crazy chat
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:46:11 why was there a shutdown yet the egg island is still here
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:36:02 why is the pissing island still there
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:38:15 1 egg hunt ended like a week ago 
2 they had ''final day'' in the title for like 3 days 
3 for people with as shit of a pc as mine with a cpu worse than an i3 and no money to get a better cpu it actually lags when you get close to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:38:46 also sometimes when im not paying attention to where im flying i accidentally fly into the propellers
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:24 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:55 i dont remember asking the island to be taken down
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:59 are we on the same page here
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:17 i was asking why its here and i didnt really get an answer
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:21 i did answer your question though
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:31 i see
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:41:20 so youre saying youd rather have the island than the ability to fly near it without risks
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:41:25 its bitten me in the ass in a dogfight
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:23 yes its so much fun to be on the island and fly into the propellers
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:30 this is the best feature that theyve added
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:43 i reckon ricks gonna say it breaks the games code to remove it because its hard coded
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:00 you see adding bigger plots is totally connected to the entire games code and will make it absolutely erupt
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:39 i dont actually script but im pretty sure anyone who does would agree this is a scapegoat
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:53 complete bullshit
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:07 the games code has to be as shit as that yandare sim game
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:19 yoo is that a mustang
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:36 isnt that the same thing as a mustang
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:41 im uneducated stop confusing me plsss
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:58 proo
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:23 i have absolutely no idea what youre on about
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:24 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:42 im not saying its not
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:22 at this point if the game is so limited that they cant even add bigger plots they would probably gain more from rewriting all 2500 lines of code
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:37 not saying they should add bigger plots
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:56 yes exo absolutely
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:05 my points are invalid because i ironically said im uneducated
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:18 yope acc
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:37 war thunder hot game
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:50:30 if i dm rick about the island hed probably say the majority wants to keep it and im not about to start a revolution
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:50:43 we all have freedom of opinions yes yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:51:14 would remaking the entire map and supposedly expanding it break the game too xd
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:06 i see
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:21 have they ever considered getting a new map maker if thats even necessary
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:41 im sure most people would want just more terrain and more flat parts and maybe have the water go all around the map if that isnt too much
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:45 mainly more water
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:58 this isnt suggestion channel but yes ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:53:27 i dont think anyone that has over an hour of playtime on this game sincerely likes this map acc
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:13 i got it because i had 24 likes on t-34 helicopter i think
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:42 turn maus into helicopter then post it
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:51 and make it normal color not red
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:10:16 i have question
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:10:27 is it normal that you cant shoot the fireworks when you go above like 20 speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:16:31 ok acc tried it and he could shoot at 187
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:16:37 why am i like the only person with this bug aaa
general 2020-06-18 17:13:32 what f
general 2020-06-18 17:13:36 vote 1 in development plsss
general 2020-06-18 17:13:46 rewriting the game would also make it less laggy and less buggy
general 2020-06-18 17:13:51 especially since alot of bugs are lag related
general 2020-06-18 17:14:00 and additionally make updates and bug fixes easier
general 2020-06-18 17:14:19 wait wrong channel i think a
general 2020-06-18 17:17:17 ok
general 2020-06-18 17:18:24 wait
general 2020-06-18 17:18:33 forget what i said i didnt read poll correctly
general 2020-06-18 17:18:52 i thought voting 2 meant there wouldnt be a rewrite you see
general 2020-06-19 09:01:26 hello there
general 2020-06-19 09:01:59 i doubt thats possible
general 2020-06-19 09:02:08 maybe theres a way to reverify
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:07 update?
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:15 i see
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:24 i couldnt read update message in time

plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:32:58 i finally figured out how swashplates worked and i spent like an hour and a half building my own swashplate contraption but its huge and thus useless to me
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:33:25 some helicopter rotor thingy
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:33:48 
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:33:51 i cant fit that in a heli
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 12:54:15 i like how the front of the ship is slanted
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 12:54:16 hot

general 2021-06-27 09:06:29 im surprised plane crazy actually functions
general 2021-06-27 09:06:35 even on low end computers
general 2021-06-27 09:06:54 but itll still be laggy and buggy as hell unless you have a midrange pc
general 2021-06-27 09:07:32 my pc is even worse

general 2021-06-27 09:26:11 this is how war thunder is intended to be played
general 2021-06-27 09:28:33 depends how you play it
general 2021-06-27 09:28:42 i went on an 11 kill spree rampage in that german boat

general 2021-06-27 09:31:17 glue eater
general 2021-06-27 09:31:32 thats what they call stupid idiots
general 2021-06-27 09:31:36 but it applies ok
general 2021-06-27 09:31:53 i saw something about a girl putting glue in her hair before
general 2021-06-27 09:32:01 and her hair was permanently hardened and stuck
general 2021-06-27 09:32:03 it was funny
general 2021-06-27 09:32:10 shes genuinely a glue eater
general 2021-06-27 09:32:13 actually stupid
general 2021-06-27 09:32:57 https://youtu.be/fT3saUVjm-c

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:08:50 is it possible to make a 90 degree camera fold that doesnt have some weird offset
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:08:57 i cant get it right
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:10:06 like this yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:10:59 what do you mean with custom angles
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:11:45 ok

general 2021-07-20 15:59:51 i see
general 2021-07-20 15:59:59 buoyancy is wild in plane crazy too
general 2021-07-20 16:00:09 they added pontoons even though this is the one game where nothing sinks
general 2021-07-20 16:00:19 oh yes
general 2021-07-20 16:01:51 heart is in the right place
general 2021-07-20 16:03:06 just spend unhealthy amounts of time on something and let the results roll in
general 2021-07-20 17:06:42 how xd
general 2021-07-20 17:06:49 did he get knocked off the map
general 2021-07-20 17:08:23 did he not overload his mech with wing panels and rockets
general 2021-07-20 17:08:26 what a nerd :\
general 2021-07-20 17:10:06 what do mech battles look like
general 2021-07-20 17:10:12 do 2 mechs just beam themselves into each other
general 2021-07-20 17:10:20 seeing what happens
general 2021-07-20 17:10:28 oh yes
general 2021-07-20 17:10:29 art
general 2021-07-20 17:11:14 someone needs to make a proper muay thai mech
general 2021-07-20 17:13:36 in 2019 or early 2020 i tried some tutorial mech exoskeleton with helium and it was arse so instead of learning mechs i simply moved onto flying into people with jets
general 2021-07-20 17:13:41 it is a far superior strategy
general 2021-07-20 17:13:55 although ive now moved onto a flying s100 schnellboot
general 2021-07-20 17:14:58 but can your ghidorah defeat the holy schnellboot
general 2021-07-20 17:15:01 master of every element

plane-crazy 2021-09-26 10:49:15 the actual jet is hot but i was a shitty builder in 2019 so it looks like dogshit
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 10:49:48 im still not a very good builder so im not sure if i can do the slanted front
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 10:49:53 yes
creations-chat 2021-09-26 19:31:53 yes 🤙
creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:43:01 hot
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:23:00 <@!206891768233328640> the nose and canopy look weird you could try fixing that too but i forgot what it actually looked like
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:26:56 from what im seeing concerning kunos ho 229 the jet engines shouldnt stick out in front of the wings, nose should be a bit sharper, and canopy should be reworked
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:29:03 probably limit try sending the other ones in a second message
creations-chat 2021-09-28 21:52:27 youre fuckin right i am
creations-chat 2021-09-29 13:32:13 proportions are wrong
creations-chat 2021-09-29 17:02:26 are these windows

creations-chat 2021-09-29 20:56:43 xd

creations-chat 2021-09-29 21:48:03 <@!653059099533115423> mortal youve made a dangerous decision downvoting the divine man face the sands of time for you are running low
creations-chat 2021-09-29 21:51:45 yes
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:19:43 guys give my super cool and innovative he-162 hof pls it has motorlocks pls pls it has 60 upvotes mod do their jobs Plz plz
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:22:16 what got storm expert roles
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:26:33 why does he think its so entitled to hof it isnt that special
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:30:32 did he finally realize it isnt hof worthy and give up
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:33:58 also what do you guys reckon could be improved other than exposed motorlocks on this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/891497988537614376 its my first motorlock build ok
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:36:22 the control surfaces?
i could probably fix it easily with motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:38:26 how do i make inlets round i have 0 experience with motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:40:52 thank
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:47:41 i probably wont get many aeronautical roles because i optimise all of my aircraft so without motorlocking theyre below 200 blocks and with motorlocking below 300
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:51:45 there isnt you should have higher designer ranks i think
did you request it
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:53:54 i got designer 4 in 2019 from some shitty t34 helicopter because 25 upvotes was enough for designer 4 back then
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:56:59 this is easily worth designer 4 man ugh smh :/
creations-chat 2021-09-30 05:38:38 this is some bollocks how can this have more upvotes than my divine t34 helicopter from 2019
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:02 i think you should go with this
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:10 otherwise the air intakes are ruined
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:03:37 what do the air intakes look like when its a block wider
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:04:16 i see
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:06:06 super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:06:11 i use super rockets for vtol too
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:06:35 hover thrusters limit how high you can go and its influenced by the floor
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:07:34 super rockets just require some trial and error but the result is way better
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:08:49 if you put them on motors yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:08:53 so you can adjust angle
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 09:10:15 oh yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:12:45 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:13:00 i quit babft for plane crazy in 2019-2020
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:13:02 im too manly
creations-chat 2021-09-30 10:22:19 why is block13alt trying to guilt trip us
creations-chat 2021-09-30 10:27:13 im not bullying you im telling you to improve your build um <@!622607246257422356> hot
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:03:52 those wing panels on the glass look cool
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:24:04 thats good pyramid wedges are hot
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:55:35 why is there yellow smoke coming from the jet engine also the nose is blocky
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:58:00 the camo seems relatively fine if you ask me thats usually what my camos look like
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:35:45 you could give it a spine
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:42:17 sabaton sucks
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:44:55 real men listen to dio, iron maiden, deep purple, manowar etc 💪 pure testosterone 🥵
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:47:33 ignore them nub dont be weak minded
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:52:48 yes but why does that bother you xd
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:56:40 what youre just saying is that youre so bothered that youre leaving the server cough cough make up your mind man it isnt a big deal
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:59:32 youre not exposing anyone, everyone already knew the community was pretty shit but every community has a group of arse cracks, youre just making a scene for no reason, if you wanna stop uploading just say the criticism sucks ass and you resign or something
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:01:58 i throw that word around like candy it doesnt mean anything anymore
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:05:49 you should still be able to take criticism, if you upload something to get nothing but an echo chamber of compliments you shouldnt be looking in pcc, the problem is that the criticism usually just sucks and ends up being an insult
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:08:03 its funny smh ugh :\
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:13:07 yngwie malmsteen pops off https://open.spotify.com/track/779OkWgGkOCtRPhzM60TBx?si=T1KQFLqWS9qh01x_q9_s2A&dl_branch=1

creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:00:43 air intakes forward pls wait nvm main wings were wrong not the air intakes
creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:06:10 top one probably
creations-chat 2021-10-01 16:24:30 <@!767387057286021160> does the barrel elevate
creations-chat 2021-10-01 18:49:20 to put it lightly it is quite the flawed build for example the fuselage, canopy, vertical tail wings
creations-chat 2021-10-02 00:53:24 this is an unpainted bi-1 what do i fix https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521806371860250624/893660657440915456/unknown.png

creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:05:21 <@!647813197570506754> can i see a picture from the top
creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:14:11 i cant tell if the wings should be backwards like one block or not but seems roughly accurate to the real thing yes
np
general 2021-10-02 01:29:12 <@!533769855006933003> nub
general 2021-10-02 01:29:17 speak up
creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:42:47 how have i managed this
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:04:22 a draft
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:45:08 <@!521504905693888521> the wings are thick, canopy looks weird and propeller doesnt look like a propeller
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:47:34 <@456226577798135808> where is air intake and why is it so lankey
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:50:00 <@!421068077556301844> can i see more perspectives of the mig-27
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:53:45 bomber or gunship Or A Fighter Jet Of Course
general 2021-10-02 13:27:27 i remember some shredderbox nerd couldnt damage my helicopter even with the box having guns and rockets on it
general 2021-10-02 13:27:38 and my helicopter only goes like 400 speed
general 2021-10-02 13:27:43 shredderbox users are Very Good
creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:34:26 too narrow
creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:36:36 hot
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:01:35 why are the elevators so thick you should make them like half a block instead
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:15:57 lighting, you could set the cycle to both and wait for it to be a bit dark but not pitch black so you can still see the lights
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:17:58 upper body pose seems fine and i cant judge the legs because i cant see them
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:25:45 <@!697878770484510831> i dont think the rusty texture is good
general 2021-10-02 14:29:16 make it look more like a ww2 yak prop
general 2021-10-02 14:29:30 thats what the design is based off
general 2021-10-02 14:29:42 its a prop and they just put a jet engine in it and moved the cockpit back a bit
general 2021-10-02 14:29:48 this one too wasnt it
general 2021-10-02 14:29:58 its roughly the same ok
general 2021-10-02 14:30:37 thats a yak-23 right
general 2021-10-02 14:30:46 yak-23 is thoroughly still based off of old yak props
general 2021-10-02 14:31:31 you ask a good question
general 2021-10-02 14:32:23 <@!389756407483990028> show top perspective of it
general 2021-10-02 14:32:30 might have to be a bit thinner i cant tell
general 2021-10-02 14:33:28 yes but youve made it 3 blocks wide
general 2021-10-02 14:33:38 yak-15/17 would be like 2 blocks on that scale
general 2021-10-02 14:33:55 yak-23 closer to 2.5 but youd need to motorlock to fix the width and it seems like a raw build so
general 2021-10-02 14:34:42 2.5 wouldve been perfect but that isnt possible without motorlocks and pistons
general 2021-10-02 14:35:10 and i dont know how youd do the front with only 2 blocks of width anyway itd probably look atrocious
general 2021-10-02 14:36:04 personally id make it 2.5 blocks wide but you should do 3 if you dont wanna remake the whole thing and make it some generic motorlock build
general 2021-10-02 14:36:26 you could also use roblox studio to measure
general 2021-10-02 14:38:04 they should be down half a block or a full block shouldnt they
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:38:21 yes now we can actually see the legs this is huge
general 2021-10-02 14:40:14 this is quite the bonerjam https://open.spotify.com/track/3G0FqZoEi8Za1oEXdGYcNG?si=2sap9cF9QG6wKCNIZvmWtg&dl_branch=1
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:40:24 graphics 10 is always best for pictures because it also improves the anti aliasing or whatever its called which will make the resolution look better on angled stuff so you can see more details
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:43:55 its ok

<@!237943056643522561> on 10 graphics you wont have the problem with the resolution on angled stuff here as is pictured and thus the build will generally look better, it also assists in lightning so its worth sacrificing the more pronounced red lights for
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:46:10 i think that looks way better, you could post it to creations now but i usually wait a while to see if i notice anything that could be changed
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:48:59 replace the jet engines with rockets probably since the jet engines dont look very good in plane crazy, and custom air intakes
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:52:17 yes its significantly too tall you should finish the hull before doing anything of the superstructure next time to get a better idea of the proportions
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:38:06 oh yes
general 2021-10-02 16:43:06 heresy
general 2021-10-02 16:43:15 yo
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:46:50 i can imagine he ends up responding just to say "it sucks bruh rebuild it bro"

creations-chat 2021-10-02 23:37:37 it has been deleted from creations
creations-chat 2021-10-02 23:43:18 uh
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:11:11 
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:13:34 is there anything i fix on my bi1 other than the nose being like quarter of a block too short
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:16:20 rear view (its too narrow for motorlocks to be hidden id have to bend the spacetime continuum and perform forbidden alchemy to pull it off)
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:23:59 you speak dangerous words
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:26:07 oh yes the bi is close to getting me expert designer
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:29:38 technically thats still 89 :\
it said 90 upvotes and 1 downvote when i checked ok
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:32:13 other than this yes
general 2021-10-03 12:50:34 did i do it right ive not done a ticket before
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:51:50 cockpit is fine but i think the nose might be half a block too tall
general 2021-10-03 12:56:00 you speak dangerous words
general 2021-10-03 12:56:03 nvm
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:02:03 the most you can do to make it better is make it grey like most mig-19s so the merging wedges dont look as bad like it does here
general 2021-10-03 13:03:06 xd
general 2021-10-03 13:03:59 for i was there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:05:01 for the front yes but now its also more generic so its your choice it doesnt really make the whole thing better or worse
general 2021-10-03 13:06:03 oh yes
general 2021-10-03 13:06:12 no
general 2021-10-03 13:06:42 its not a functional link nub itll probably bring you to a fake roblox page that says youre logged out or something
general 2021-10-03 13:09:43 makeup man
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:21:14 you could make just the nose grey or black depending on what looks best and give the rest of the body the initial green color scheme with blue at the bottom
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:24:08 making the nose the same blue color as the bottom of the plane could look cool
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:29:28 if youre using that shade of green then yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:38:29 also make the wing more slanted like this, custom angles would be even better
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:50:12 hot but put a half triangle wedge here
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:55:19 Shit fuck
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:02:55 go lightbulb section, signs and text 1x1 block and copy and paste an emoji on there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:11:21 🥵
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:17:59 you can look at it from the top and compare it to blueprints to see if the wings are long enough mig-19 wings are pretty long
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:20:23 show a top view of your jet i check


<@!640250360493244455> why are there red stars on the rockets but a bosnian flag on the door
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:26:02 yes im pretty sure thats good


<@!791544058661044245> the tank could use better color, more details and signs for tank treads so theyre thinner
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:43:02 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:45:18 <@!640250360493244455> upload the video to streamable.com and copy from there and resend
creations-chat 2021-10-03 15:07:01 hes making a mig-19 and youre telling him to make it look more like a mig-21 Genius
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:21:32 added some details and changed paint
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:23:45 the trails on the tail lag me in flight for some reason so ill remove them for the version i actually use
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:26:01 it also irrevertably ruins the balance of the plane
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:28:25 theyre not completely different planes but theyre undeniably noticably different to some extent in almost every aspect, the mig-21 was revolutionary compared to the other migs its not just some small upgrade that goes faster and doesnt rip as fast, theyre not exactly "roughly the same thing"
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:35:47 kamerad hans
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:37:50 this is the sickest argument when will there be a sitcom about creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:41:08 the red squares on the wings to resemble the red star dont look very good it just looks more like the japanese symbol you should probably paint it grey too

<@!796795041212399657> i dont know ok ive never had that problem
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:43:50 this is better than twitter
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:46:45 to be fair his main wing was already finished and clearly resembled a mig-19 you did not do a great job deducting what plane it was there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:36:53 <@!529111635844136971> why downvote :\
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:43:53 yes

<@456226577798135808> what does unde even mean
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:52:02 is my bi ugly because of the few exposed motorlocks which i cant hide because the plane is less than 2 blocks wide
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:55:50 probably but i would have no clue how to fix that since thered still be motorlocks there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:59:18 i havent even seen it but i am just gonna say it is lacking detail and nice colors which probably isnt wrong
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:01:41 also you havent told me whats wrong with the bi other than saying its ugly with nothing to back it up, can you give me some feedback so i can see if theres anything wrong with it that i can actually fix
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:05:16 youre right the nose is a bit short but its only half a block and its really hard to fix is that why you downvoted it xd
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:07:53 its probably the fact that everything is technically wrong because its nigh impossible to make a bi look even close to perfect at this scale in plane crazy i assume its primarily the canopy because its meant to be slightly round but i couldnt pull that off in an area of 1.5x1x1
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:11:42 i already removed the trails on the tail of the revamped bi because it ruined the balance and i couldnt fix it without removing the trails i personally value functionality over looks but im trying to make both the looks and the functionality good thats why i asked about the downvote
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:13:58 yes thats why i still bothered to send a picture of it here to show i actually atleast thought of it and managed to put them on
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:16:14 technically here but those were put there intentionally for decoration
its still a criminal sin of course :\
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:54:30 the scope of his genius literally has no bounds
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:58:06 yes but wip builds arent allowed in creations you were meant to post it here 

<@!853042393309904897> hot
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:01:29 nop was talking to the other guy
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:14:40 mine arent for decoration mine are just there because the plane is quite literally too tiny for them to be hidden apart from the ones at the main wings but those would require 3 extra layers of motorlock which i couldnt be arsed to do
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:22:06 i dont build tanks but i think its fine looks pretty detailed and well shaped
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:29:44 xd
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:49:11 neither
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:49:20 i stay below 1000 for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:49:35 for more fun while flying it i do like 1200-1600
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:50:02 i dont know how youd actually do pvp at 3k speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:51:16 anyone ive fought that went that fast essentially had the playstyle of "i win because you cant catch me lol im not even in your render distance xD" or they slowed down to like 300 speed to try shooting me and miserably failed because their speed is so inconsistent they can only go too slow or too fast
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:53:44 the porportions of the type 90 seem relatively fine he couldve hardly seen such a small offset of like less than half a fuckin block anyway
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:55:47 well yes but you get the point ok i personally wouldnt say thats worth downvoting for, the details are amazing
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:58:50 unless its my upcoming fuso which will totally be perfect yes 🤙 it will be put in hof 17 times
creations-chat 2021-10-03 22:36:17 <@!398300194258550784> is that the thing from code geass

creations-chat 2021-10-05 14:25:22 tnt is better for optimisation because the block just disappears so if you only play in vips or pvp servers you should use tnt its more handy for low end pcs ok
creations-chat 2021-10-05 14:54:40 no its suspenions
general 2021-10-05 14:58:55 why are there bricks here with no pillars holding it

general 2021-10-05 15:18:56 i return to the game once every half a year
general 2021-10-05 15:20:02 and what do the 40 people do
general 2021-10-05 15:20:21 everyone would be underage
general 2021-10-05 15:21:04 if only pc players join pcc we would have no more than 300 members
general 2021-10-05 15:21:12 the game got too popular
general 2021-10-05 15:21:19 it was almighty back in 2019
general 2021-10-05 15:22:41 i meant as in what work do they actually do because the game hasnt changed a single bit since little after it got a bit popular
general 2021-10-05 15:23:41 brickbronze was shit
general 2021-10-05 15:23:47 marshadow drool
general 2021-10-05 15:23:55 but marshadow users were also shit so it wasnt hard to beat them
general 2021-10-05 15:23:58 it was still stale
general 2021-10-05 15:24:13 same but nowadays itd be dogshit
general 2021-10-05 15:24:27 the grind for good pvp pokemons was also miserable
general 2021-10-05 15:24:48 delete roblox essentially
general 2021-10-05 15:24:53 name a single good game on roblox
general 2021-10-05 15:25:01 hardcoded
general 2021-10-05 15:25:08 generic
general 2021-10-05 15:26:40 i dont really like when roblox devs try making their game look extremely good because usually they just amp up the bloom and put some eye burning lighting without optimising their game at all and call it a day
general 2021-10-05 15:27:52 have you seen the sun in the new call of duty
general 2021-10-05 15:27:57 its like looking into the fuckin sun irl
general 2021-10-05 15:27:59 Immersive
general 2021-10-05 15:28:51 my account is from late 2016 all i did before then that i remember was play phantom forces at a friends house i think
general 2021-10-05 15:29:31 rhs was never good
general 2021-10-05 15:29:44 its throwing a spanner in kids' roleplays that was fun
general 2021-10-05 15:30:03 roleplayers are dying out
general 2021-10-05 15:30:09 roleplayers in ultimate driving are almighty
general 2021-10-05 15:30:18 you can infinitely bollock them up
general 2021-10-05 15:30:26 but theres barely any
general 2021-10-05 15:30:38 it was still huge in early 2020 but it speedran dying
general 2021-10-05 15:31:27 dunno like 15k probably
general 2021-10-05 15:31:31 arsenal is way bigger isnt it
general 2021-10-05 15:31:44 id assume arsenal has like 50k
general 2021-10-05 15:32:22 its because kids play it once and think they can aim and get hooked
general 2021-10-05 15:32:28 then they run into exploiters
general 2021-10-05 15:32:34 and people with 650k kills
general 2021-10-05 15:33:52 some people are unnaturally good at arsenal for some reason
general 2021-10-05 15:34:02 out of any game they chose to master one with 4 script kiddies per server
general 2021-10-05 15:34:29 arsenal isnt laggy enough i think
general 2021-10-05 15:34:32 not in vips
general 2021-10-05 15:34:40 it wont make big enough of a difference
general 2021-10-05 15:34:45 if he only had 10 fps then yes
general 2021-10-05 15:35:01 but he can easily have like 30 with a pc worse than mine
general 2021-10-05 15:36:17 lemons

general 2021-10-05 15:36:21 great minds think alike
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:53:18 my helis go like 350-400 but only ones propelled by an additional rocket the fastest heli i have that actually flies like a heli goes like 240-300
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:55:46 i like my helicopters a bit fast
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:58:41 no then it should just have good guns and stability
creations-chat 2021-10-05 19:02:16 rockets and fireworks are good on helicopters, if you use normal guns youll be shot down by some car with a giant turret before you can immobilize them, youd wanna use explosive stuff so you can hit them first and actually be efficient

creations-chat 2021-11-12 17:42:20 <@456226577798135808> paint the locked motor in the nose cone black
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:10:04 uh umm
creations-chat 2021-11-19 16:49:33 ice weighs less too
creations-chat 2021-11-20 02:49:19 who gives a shit if his plane looks like an egg

<@!697893501274161325> yes why
creations-chat 2021-11-20 02:55:28 it flies and has more than 5 blocks stop whining and bugger off

pictured is symionboss ugh
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:00:57 bringing politics into unrelated arguments is the best strategy ok
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:04:03 <@!847981335078895680> also change color of your plane pls
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:06:06 just a different shade maybe darker, i cant get color codes right now
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:11:08 evil man
creations-chat 2021-11-22 14:06:05 <@!720891502108344360> can i see an eagle eye view of the plane so i can see the wings better
creations-chat 2021-11-22 14:13:16 looks better than i thought
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:03:41 the hull sucks, and if this is a custom build the superstructure is pretty boring, the overload of little turrets obscure the deck, if you wanna fix the hull i can give an example later on what i think the right technique is, and for superstructure just look for inspiration
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:05:55 what
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:03:46 the only people who criticised his build gave actual valid and useful criticism
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:13:19 <@!784805177517539349> you could make the hull look more like this (technique wise)
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:15:28 itll still look fine from the top, yours just looks blocky as fuck and has no shape to it
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:20:42 building it like this first is a good way to get logical patterns which helps getting the shape right


<@!738086786970026035> yes
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:25:35 but now the one time someone gets actual valid criticism in this god forsaken horrid channel youre convincing the guy its just ''rudeness'', ive never seen you complain here when someone is actually being entirely shit on and harassed for no reason
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:29:44 i know it looks shit ok but it looks better from every other angle i promise pls
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:34:17 it isnt really happening now though, you shouldnt convince him its mere rudeness, his hull doesnt have a good shape like real hulls do which isnt opinion based you can clearly tell by comparing it to better built hulls, and now he obviously isnt a immediately a pro or anything i still actually bothered to remember leaving what i was initially playing and joining plane crazy just to show this guy with an inferiority complex how i think he should handle the hull

whats happening now is absolutely fine compared to the shit you see here half of the time
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:37:03 also if youre remotely interested i can show you ingame its actually much better than it looks on that picture with the shitty angle ok
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:58:44 its a work of art man
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:05:54 if anyone wants to have a good laugh dm 2014naenaesavage saying criticism is subjective 🤫
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:22:11 is there something wrong with it i was just pointing out the hull style wont affect the look from the top
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:24:33 i might, but i wanna finish the superstructure first since its a fuso and thats much harder than the hull on this (top view) fuso irl
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:29:18 <@!798957190399524865> you were talking about these parts right
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:32:00 did this relieve the agony or is it actually shit
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:34:57 blender crashes my pc because my pc is garbage ok i cant use blender to build ships instead
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:37:25 though you have a point this part in particular is garbage it sticks out way too much
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:40:07 and i should probably make the shape here go more like this
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:47:02 me or the other guy
no idea where to check but pretty sure its 2.91
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:50:03 it came out on the 25th of november 2020 xd
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:52:17 wise
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:58:47 its nenuu's magnum opus hes never topping such a masterpiece man
creations-chat 2021-11-24 23:16:20 <@456226577798135808> ok jet but pls pls fix this pls
creations-chat 2021-11-25 00:39:13 <@!693888535266197586> you forgot to put a space between 2010 and the block count
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:58:35 no because yours looks like a crossbreed of a delorean and a urus pls use reference pic next time ok also color shade isnt correct
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:05:54 experience, just keep building shit and when youve built enough shit it starts to become less shit dont bother uploading it here since you wont get any criticism from the people here
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:09:29 youve only been building for like a year assuming you havent played very long when you uploaded your first creation, ive built since like mid-late 2019 and id still be considered mediocre it takes more time than you think unless you take the game way too seriously
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:13:34 Abdul
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:15:56 small aircraft best :\
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:19:11 send video of it driving i care more about functionality when it comes to ground vehicles
i wanna see if theres anything special about it
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:25:04 thats not very special also the rear suspension seems a bit weak
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:27:06 but i dont hate your builds send the supra no balls
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:29:11 color pls and i can already tell from this angle that the rear window is probably completely wrong the rest seems ok
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:31:52 <@!354280132569071616> that guys blue jet looks pro
<@!817843440191930430> did you make that
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:34:36 its good
creations-chat 2021-11-25 19:40:29 ive made the hull much less agonizing to look at the curves are now actually logical
creations-chat 2021-11-26 17:23:25 does the turret work
creations-chat 2021-11-27 14:09:24 genius
creations-chat 2021-11-27 17:03:47 hot
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:23:53 <@456226577798135808> why is the bow so long
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:25:56 <@!683889176650973187> why did you motorlock
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:29:45 you should just use actual wing panels and delta wings for the main wings because they have the wrong shape now
creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:59:19 it looks like a monster truck
creations-chat 2021-12-01 21:42:36 his ping is the best part
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:11:14 what the fuck
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:35:28 the cockpit is a much bigger issue how do i delete this image on mobile i did not mean to do this help im not going to bollocking delete the entire message with this slowmode ok
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:38:33 its a holy image i must not get rid of it even if i can also yes make the cockpit less big
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:42:06 both and better shape because that looks like the cockpit from my mid 2019 eurofighter typhoon that even back then got absolutely shit on
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:44:23 
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:58:19 these were the days
creations-chat 2021-12-02 12:29:24 still a bit too long
creations-chat 2021-12-02 12:31:44 try making the cockpit look more like that of an f22 or f35 it probably fits the design of your jet
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:02:49 too long <@!744591826891046943> and make the top of the cockpit more flat and the front less angled than the back
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:04:54 it was garbage in the entirety of 2019
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:07:29 motorlock isnt important imo i dont get why people nowadays learn to motorlock before learning to actually build
motorlocking should just be for when you can already build well with traditional techniques so you can make shit even better, if youre good at actually building normally motorlocking wont be a big learning curve
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:09:40 i tried camera locking before and i couldnt get along with it but that was me trying to construct a canopy with it which probably isnt a good idea
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:12:04 now add a spine
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:18:22 <@456226577798135808> this was my first motorlocked build its not bad not great just a small improvement over normally building and i learn more advanced motorlocking from here
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:21:53 why did you ping support xd
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:28:48 isnt he meant to ping a mod
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:30:53 im braindead
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:32:02 how would that work better what
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:34:52 why does it only go like 300 speed
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:37:01 at that speed it should have absolutely no problem going up using the elevators as intended id call it a design flaw
creations-chat 2021-12-03 18:09:48 holland is an evil place (region)
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:43:02 last question yes thats what this channel is for
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:45:47 add more variation in the color by giving it like a camo and make the overall shade darker, add actual holes in the air intakes if you can and fix this pls, but if you arent trying to make it as good as possible then yes you can post
creations-chat 2021-12-04 23:27:21 what does double's t72 look like
creations-chat 2021-12-04 23:30:59 i like double's t72 more
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:13:39 it took me 10 minutes to learn youll be fine ok

creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:19:37 choosing a mig-21 isnt a mistake unless he prioritises upvotes over an actually good creation

general 2022-01-10 14:13:29 you can easily make non glitch jets go slightly below 800 sps by decreasing wing surface but itll fly like horse shit
general 2022-01-10 14:14:21 its supposed to fly less well if you have less wing surface but ok
general 2022-01-10 14:14:34 wing surface = good 🤤

general 2022-01-16 06:59:31 i will strap 15 conveyor drives to my jet and go 600k sps and it will be very viable for pvp and fun to use real
general 2022-01-16 06:59:57 cutters are useless on any aircraft going faster than 500 speed
general 2022-01-16 07:00:09 even if the shredder is standing still
general 2022-01-16 07:00:25 most shredders i see use rockets and guns but suck fuck at aiming and get styled on
general 2022-01-16 07:01:31 do you use shredders with explosives strapped to them or something
general 2022-01-16 07:01:35 highly efficient
general 2022-01-16 07:02:05 does tnt even shield against explosives
general 2022-01-16 07:02:22 i use fireworks for weapons and theyre ass to aim but with some good rng it gets the job done
general 2022-01-16 07:03:33 ah yes im sure they beat some guy who uses crusty conveyor drive jets that go mach 13
general 2022-01-16 07:04:01 shredders cant even kill me when im in my helicopter half of the time
general 2022-01-16 07:04:28 1000 sps is the perfect speed man

creations-chat 2022-01-16 19:07:26 yes
creations-chat 2022-01-16 19:18:35 i dont know if youre motorlocking that jet or not but if not you could maybe make it something like this i think itd look good but you should see for yourself (colored version is so you can see the parts)

general 2022-01-20 11:34:09 who

general 2022-01-20 11:34:36 Evil Man
general 2022-01-20 11:35:17 also yes im dutch
general 2022-01-20 11:41:06 quite convincing to the untrained eye
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:47:34 the proportions are all bollocked
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:50:53 
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:52:57 you made the air intakes a bit too big and every single angle is wrong (or the wings are just extremely massive)
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:55:57 angle locking those wings might be a huge pain in the ass but if you want it to be as good as possible you should try it, i also suggest you severely angle lock the entire nose section since thats like the hottest part of the f22 ok

creations-chat 2022-01-21 17:32:17 smart move
creations-chat 2022-01-21 17:34:36 🤤
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:13:52 the rear just cuts off but its meant to be just 2 jet engines and a ballast
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:17:57 like theres little to no space between the two jet engines since they are meant to curve inwards a bit, but you didnt curve it at all and now theyre completely seperated (youll probably need motorlock and custom angle to make it anything remotely like the real thing)
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:19:59 you could try doing it without motorlock first since learning to actually build is more important than learning tricks, you could also make your life easier and learn it on an entirely new jet so you can start with the motorlock tower from yt tutorial and build it onto that so its easier to learn, you could rebuild the j22 later on instead of getting stuck up with this one

general 2022-01-23 16:46:05 what the fuck is happening
general 2022-01-23 16:47:13 and it doesnt work for shit above like 500 speed and youre practically immune to rockets at that speed too
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:48:17 um
general 2022-01-23 16:49:06 500 is ok
general 2022-01-23 16:49:12 1000 speed is 🤤
general 2022-01-23 16:49:16 above 1000 🤢
general 2022-01-23 16:49:26 conveyor engine 🤮
general 2022-01-23 16:50:01 conveyor engine planes cant do shit to a muscular manly 1000 speed plane
general 2022-01-23 16:50:09 no point in going faster than 1000 speed
general 2022-01-23 16:50:13 yes
general 2022-01-23 16:50:38 700-1300 normal jet speed for me
general 2022-01-23 16:50:54 1300 is still garbage for actual pvp though
general 2022-01-23 16:51:37 no because i use fireworks and they arent consistent even if youre standing still
general 2022-01-23 16:51:46 but nothing is more amusing than accidentally killing someone with fireworks
general 2022-01-23 16:52:24 if you spam them at like 800 speed they start going 60 degrees off to the side
general 2022-01-23 16:52:54 imagine pissing on people with guns
general 2022-01-23 16:52:59 shitting on them with fireworks 💪
general 2022-01-23 16:53:14 imagine

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:55:02 he might be short but his masculinity is compressed and more dense and therefore he has more testosterone
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:55:22 unless were comparing him to me for i am the most manly man with the most testosterone
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:55:53 stop using common sense and logic against my infinite wisdom man
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:56:13 sleep with one eye open

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:01:38 half of yours will always be sleeping soon if you dont Watch Your Mouth
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:01:43 i have no clue what i just said
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:01:48 i have wisdom beyond my years
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:04:28 brown
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:09:11 that will probably look garbage
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:17:01 i will never recover from this
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:17:08 you will regret this one day
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:17:52 if this is your ship your hull shapes are bollocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:18:00 you keep repeating the same shape
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:18:05 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:18:33 
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:19:07 theres like no curvature in the hull man!
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:19:19 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:22:10 can you show me what its based off instead
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:22:48 i am experienced with this technique for hull building because its how youre meant to do it in build a boat for treasure which i played prior to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:23:00 
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:23:22 what is that based off
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:23:34 its not mine btw its his
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:23:54 atleast 1m because i went afk with helium one time
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:25:00 yes your hull is wrong then
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:25:27 slightly
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:26:18 it shouldve been more like this at the front
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:26:26 you have no clue what i mean but its hard to explain ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:26:54 the bottom 2 layers need to go back even further
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:27:44 atleast youre using this technique
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:27:53 i prefer it over those blocky hulls that most people build
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:28:01 your heart is in the right place ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:28:56 this is 🤤
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:29:41 oh yes

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:30:01 the small ones
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:30:23 i always use 10 graphics for pics even though i have shitty integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:30:39 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:31:08 shawndji2016 is the best ship builder out there man
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:31:41 10 graphics, hiding hui and choosing good angles
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:32:02 it was light hearted sarcasm
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:32:46 probably shaders
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:32:58 im not a fan of shaders because they make the sun harder to look at than the actual sun irl
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:33:17 i dont get why people think it looks good
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:33:20 its too extreme
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:33:26 and probably laggy as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:33:34 unless you have a high end gpu
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:35:42 im not a master ship builder i dont have much experience in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:35:56 i cant tell if you were being sarcastic ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:36:16 it looks good if you look away from the sun
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:36:22 since it improves the overall graphics
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:36:29 later
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:36:31 im eating
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:38:26 hi

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:39:10 that would look pretty cool if the skybox wasnt shit
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:39:30 where im from theres lots of beer too
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:41:42 im on an account called proisyesok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:41:44 join that
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:42:37 ok

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:42:48 this will be tight timing
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:44:09 <@!922376197281841162> what is your roblox username
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:44:17 wait theres someone called shasam in the server
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:44:37 oh yes youre next to me
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 20:59:57 that wont solve it + it has to do with center of mass as well
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:00:32 if rick would remove that feature you wouldnt be able to rotate stuff without motors anymore
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:00:34 its dumb
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:01:01 theres nothing wrong with it you just need to counter the pitch
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:01:50 you can replace wing panels with other blocks for less drag/lift, place wing panels elsewhere and use ballasts
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:02:14 what i do is combine all of the above and use a propeller engine in the nose or rear
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:02:27 for the best possible balance
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 21:03:53 youre complaining about rockets having thrust coming from where those rockets are placed in other words youre complaining about the game being logical 🤯
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 08:25:49 not really, if you fix the front wheels, give it some color and turn the sparklers off youll already be a long way ahead
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 08:26:05 but if you want it to actually look good you should probably get more experience and rebuild
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:22:59 show me a good build of yours no balls
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:26:41 not bad but assuming this is a custom build i do not understand the wheels
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:27:08 if its a real thing then what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:27:19 id put the wheels more inwards and make them thicker
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:27:29 big tires 🤤
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:27:36 the rear ones atleast
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 09:27:39 like alot of old hot rods

creations-chat 2022-04-04 14:12:29 wouldnt it look better with that sharp nose considering how lengthy and lankey it is
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 13:36:21 theyre not gonna add it
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 13:36:48 but theres a chance itll exist in plane crazy 2 which is said to come out this summer
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 13:36:54 big rewrite
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:27:26 i cant run the game in any state at 60 fps
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:27:36 but block count doesnt affect it much
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:27:42 its probably the map
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:01 mine runs at 30 but i can use big ships with thousands of blocks at like 15-20
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:45 it doesnt really matter for ships though
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 11:30:53 if your fps tanks with fast planes thats a problem
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 22:35:12 we know
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:39:02 do second and probably move it one block to the front
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:42:57 going over 1200 speed is satanic
