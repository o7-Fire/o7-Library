plane-crazy 2019-11-30 10:15:30 any tips on making good-looking planes?
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 20:59:47 hey, how do you use pilot seats?
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 21:01:00 i meant the blue ones
general 2019-12-30 18:21:08 ^
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 09:59:02 and a camera
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:06:27 does anyone else have problems with motor2 tank turrets? mine just wiggles when i spawn
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:08:06 is that the issue?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:08:45 nope, checked just now and changing it doesn't help
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:01 99 flings me around when i move my turret
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:27 and 1000 does the funny wiggle
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:40 which sometimes stops and goes back to normal
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:47 ye
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:51 ^
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:55 ye
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:13:50 doesnt fling
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:13:52 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:14:07 could it be that barrel is too heavy?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:15:12 but then it wouldn't make sense that something with barrel x2 longer and smaller turret base works perfectly with motor2
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:16:09 also it's weird that after recent updates it just stopped working like earlier
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:16:30 and the wiggling issue started
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:18:25 ye i just spawned in 3 times and 2 times i wiggled endlessly and one time i wiggled then it just worked normally
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 18:00:28 what does the "fixed" setting do in the smoke pipe/snow pipe?
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 17:40:11 i think that's on/off setting
