plane-crazy 2021-10-31 03:59:25 voicemod uses like 2.5 gb while roblox uses like 150 mb
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 04:02:15 i love how i exploited (not really) a xbox feature by having my brothers xbox gamepass account on his xbox and my account on his xbox i can litterally download any game with gamepass for free

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:46:11 UPDATE
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 02:47:08 sad
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:14:47 
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 01:34:58 bruh why is supercars filtered
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:29:09 found this in the test server... no clue why it happened. all i did was go afk for 2 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:32:29 i mean i always wanted to dress my avatar as a noob. i aint complaining
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 23:41:07 i have a chainhook helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:51:47 hey guys i got a question. how many rounds per second does the plane crazy gun fire at?
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:53:16 idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:53:29 like 600 sps = 500 mph
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:53:46 so i guess the mph is like 5/6 of the sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:54:04 yea on redit
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:54:08 i think
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:54:38 so if your build does a top speed of 300 sps it would be like 250 mph
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:55:24 i remember the one time when plane crazy ran at 120 fps for me XD
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 00:55:52 and i have a low end pc that cant even run forza horizon 3
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:32:08 i wonder what the max speed of a rocket engine is
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:32:19 super rocket engine actually
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:50:26 so how many feet/meters is one block
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:55:05 im guessing if you put a block with super  engines around it on a motor it would rotate 62300 times
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:55:38 so yes my super engines will gap your motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:55:48 and in style
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:56:39 plus with 2 motors... the motors get a lil awkward even at 1000 torque
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:56:50 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:57:27 ... then my rpm guess is off
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:58:32 alright so i think i did it right but basically the super engines have the rpm of a dang diesel engine XD
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:58:49 so yes officer i was going the speed limit
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 03:59:34 alright imma make a front wheel drive diesel powered honda civic
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:00:40 tbh i think it would be funny if roblox made everyone old style noobs for april fools next year
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:02:52 alright um i want you guys to decide if i should make a automatic transmission or a manual
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:05:35 bruh... ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:05:46 well thats going to be difficult
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:06:13 so um should it automatically shift or should it only have 1 gear
general 2021-12-14 05:21:42 i remember i made a lego ak47 rubber band gun XD. it was very high detailed
general 2021-12-18 01:00:52 congrats. the test game is more buggy than the original game XD.
general 2021-12-29 19:27:43 is it possible that the plane crazy game server age could break the physics?
general 2021-12-29 19:28:04 well.
general 2021-12-29 19:28:32 i guess imma have to spend another hour rebuilding it and seeing if it doesnt glitch out
general 2021-12-29 19:30:55 its a engine that uses hover engines to propell a crank and shaft to make power. i litterally spent 20 minutes figuring out why the heck its not spinning over. i reset once which didnt work and i left the game. and if i join another server and it works then imma stop playing the game fr
general 2021-12-29 19:31:18 well that new server didnt fix it
general 2021-12-29 19:31:25 wonderful ðŸ™‚
general 2021-12-29 19:32:06 i guess imma play another game
general 2021-12-29 19:32:32 i am setting that as my status bc its so comical
general 2021-12-29 19:42:04 type much?
bug-reports 2022-01-13 01:08:25 bruh im still suprised that has not been fixed for 6 months. i dont even know how people havent noticed that

plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:45:47 so when is plane crazy 2 going to be releasing?
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:48:54 ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:49:31 try using propellers
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:51:08 you could hide control surfaces in the center of the front of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:53:16 i hate doing that though
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:53:33 well im not playing plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:54:03 i still dont like how the game im playing is grind based
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:57:02 macpherson struts
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:57:28 what
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:57:41 the test server is less buggy
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:57:54 plus my slots are all used up on og
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:58:13 just search up plane crazy development test
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 01:02:20 also desiredcoffe the test server has pvp enabled no matter what. so i recommend you make a free vip server
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 03:22:24 plane crazy at its finest
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 03:25:57 it also indicates your exact coordinates
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 21:54:13 im sorry but i really dont like the idea of converting the creations from pc1 to pc2, id rather have a blank start
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 21:54:36 plus my pc1 creations sucked just because i had to make work arounds
