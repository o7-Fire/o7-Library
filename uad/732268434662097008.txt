general 2022-03-09 16:46:27 hey in pc2 will there be something like a variable piston where you can adjust it to specific heights and not just max or minimum heights?
general 2022-03-09 18:39:36 yea but you cant set it to a specific amount, what i mean is like a way to throttle the pistonâ€™s distance
