creations-chat 2020-03-06 02:45:09 all my designs are based on ones ive made on build a boat for treasure
creations-chat 2020-03-06 02:45:17 so I dont expect them to work the best on a different game
creations-chat 2020-03-06 02:45:30 though this game is better for tank designs
creations-chat 2020-03-06 02:45:39 every block counts
creations-chat 2020-03-06 02:45:45 add too much and your tank is crap

What does it do? launches 200 balls within a minute.
I'd call it a huge revolver due to how it works.
Inspiration: <@!313403326081531914> 's machine gun video. I got the idea of the carriage system from it
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:14:02 Least my suggestion has 26 upvotes and no downvotes. Hopefully it is noticed by rick
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:27:40 Ik it won’t
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:27:45 Nor that they matter
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:28:06 I am aware of that
creations-chat 2020-03-15 21:36:40 MKIII tank chassis, inspired by the King Tiger tonk. she's the most reliable that ive ever made (388 props with 100 speed with very high torque)
creations-chat 2020-03-15 21:37:32 :))
creations-chat 2020-03-15 21:37:56 shes the best one ive made
creations-chat 2020-03-15 21:38:07 ?
creations-chat 2020-03-15 21:39:28 (second pic)
creations-chat 2020-03-15 22:48:04 ^
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:15:24 Germany is proud, I have completed the tank chassis
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:15:43 Yeah I did earlier today
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:15:45 And
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:15:54 This puppy doesn’t need the tracks attached to any part of it
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:16:00 Heck doesn’t even need guides
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:16:24 The damn thing is so reliable
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:17:02 Though I will not be saying what I did to make it for a while as someone will call it theirs and make some crap tutorial on it
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:17:49 No, it’s different
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:18:23 I won’t reveal what’s different from my tank chassis from others
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:18:34 But I’ve looked all over the internet
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:18:42 And I’ve seen nothing about what I did
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:19:22 You need to see it for yourself to know the difference
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:19:23 No
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:19:28 Nothing close to that
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:19:53 You haven’t
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:19:57 It’s very subtle
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:20:03 But increases reliability
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:20:14 Ok I’m getting McDonald’s ice cream
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:20:26 When I’m back I’ll show you what’s different from motor tank tracks
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:20:33 Oki
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:20:34 Brb
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:21:44 Not the same design nor does it have the same wheels
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:22:23 Th  at ain’t it and also those tiger tracks are more innacurate
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 00:22:38 Than mine*

plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:26:55 :)))))
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:27:09 her top speed is 200
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:27:18 5 layers of armor
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:27:30 only way I can think of 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:27:37 nor is it a cube dumby
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:28:10 it moved via wheels
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:28:21 wheels were 7 blocks in each direction
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:28:29 yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:29:35 i cant film on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:29:40 so I cant show ye how fast it is
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:29:53 as on my computer it cannot handle it
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:29:57 and it goes 1 meter per second
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:30:06 meanwhile on my phone it goes fast as hell
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:30:27 what about it
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:30:43 15*
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:31:06 my first 2 did way better in upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:31:15 meanwhile they look bad compared t oit
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:31:17 to it*
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:31:56 you didnt like my MKII because it wasnt 100% tight
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:32:12 do you mean 3K
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:32:13 ?
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:33:39 I'd rather make something more functional
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:33:42 than looks good
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:33:47 the more weight added the more useless it is
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:33:54 as ive made a 1K tank before
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:33:57 it barely moved
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:35:26 well what would you rather
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:35:30 something you're passionate about
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:35:41 or something you're not a fan of and wish you havent wasted time on it
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:35:56 cuz to me its a waste of time to make something pretty when you can have something that works fantastic
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:36:11 ?
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:36:24 you cant make a pretty tank work well
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:36:32 600+ block range kills the damn thing
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:37:03 you gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:37:10 and that idea might work
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:37:13 but will probably not
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:37:25 and will take me hours to make
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:37:46 a tank that is 50x30 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:39:49 i take criticism for how to improve upon tank tracks
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:40:03 I only did that once though, which was fabric wheels.
plane-crazy 2020-03-17 04:40:09 ive gotten nothing else
