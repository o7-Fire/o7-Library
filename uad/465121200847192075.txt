plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:15:09 should my 3rd plane be motor locked
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:16:04 i am a newbie
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:16:16 motorlock does not look simple at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:16:24 well i gotta practice first
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:26:54 Does every motorlock build require usage of explosive blocks?

plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:35:14 im sorry if im asking too much questions
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:35:38 without anything?
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:35:45 ok good
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:38:24 so if someone manages to shoot my motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:38:33 my plane will basically become unstable?
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:39:19 so it will collapse
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:39:25 cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 18:39:38 time to figure out where peoples motorlocks are and shoot them there

plane-crazy 2021-04-04 19:18:16 most of the tutorials are atleast 5 minutes long

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:46:44 yeah its a little bit short
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:47:33 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:48:18 its my second non-tutorial build alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:48:55 so first people say make wings bigger
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:02 and now people are saying wings need to be lower
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:49:04 alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:52:33 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:52:43 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:53:29 WHATS WRONG WITH THEM
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:53:45 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:54:58 hi
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:55:53 i dont even know what to do now
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:56:04 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:58:03 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:58:29 yeajh kinda ugly tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:59:46 so like
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 20:59:53 make it 1 block closer to cockpit?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:01:26 the delta wings what
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 21:02:14 <@!322877886069604353>
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:49:48 Should I make my 3rd build a helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:52:40 i just dont know what plane to build
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:52:55 i could make a bri ish vtol harrier or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:53:09 but idk really
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:58:52 i dont really like being a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:58:56 it feels like being an easy target
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 16:59:33 plus people can often knock you out of existance
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:00:14 its pretty light tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:00:18 it has almost no armor
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:00:29 good weapons but very easy to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:00:53 
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:02 <@!699794627095429180>
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:13 bombs can take you out well
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:26 its the same situation
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:33 good idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:37 but idk how to make one
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:01:56 and i want to attack/play offensive
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:02:00 dont wanna be stuck under water
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:04:16 i said it a million times
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:04:19 its an easy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:04:21 target
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:05:31 not really
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:05:58 if i make a fast, manuevarable plane i can easily escape from people
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:07:34 good idea but i dont wanna make big planes right now
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:07:45 the reason is that im still a newbie
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:07:52 i still have mechancis to learn
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:11:29 that seems fairly easy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:12:01 plus i learned a bit when building a tutorial ah-1z
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:12:38 
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:22:34 I dont understand
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 17:22:54

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:00:38 it took me like 2-3 hours to realize what i could do
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:02:08 since my wings were were thin people told me to make them wider
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:02:51 i didnt realize i could just place 1 wing panel 1x1 and 1 delta 1x1
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:03:26 im gonna have a mental breakdown
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 07:04:42 I think exhausts will be easy to make

creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:39:05 mate, this seems too big
creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:49:17 is 1 or 2 layers of control surfaces enough to control a big-ass plane?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:56:47 will this be enough to control a big Xian H-6 bomber plane
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:01:56 what are those things
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:07:25 like these?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:10:02 im 99 % sure using control surfaces would be way easier to make the wings
creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:19:22 yeah, i used that vid to make the custom control surfaces, but (i think) due to the size of the wings it probably wont work
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:19:31 society if we had half triangle wedge 1x2/3/4 and corner wedge 1x2/3/4
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 22:08:00 how can i make the cockpit for my xian h-6

plane-crazy 2021-05-03 19:46:43 well
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 19:46:48 how to explain it
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 19:46:57 basically you hold your left mouse and delete fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 19:47:20 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 19:47:53 but an actual feature like that would be convenient, atleast imo
creations-chat 2021-05-03 20:01:43 do you guys think that the nose and cockpit for my f35 is a bit too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:03:43 do you guys think that the cockpit and nose is oversized

plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:19:41 useful
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:28:44 what do you think about nose and cockpit now
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:28:51 or should i reduce the size of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:29:47 fair enough, ill fix it to 1x2 half wedge downs
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:31:39 configure to edit
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:32:23 whats the block between half wedge down and 1x2 wedge down
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:34:11 think its pretty good now
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 20:37:00 pretty sure you meant 1x2 half wedge down
