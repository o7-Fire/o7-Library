The Tale of fernman (301411553687765002)
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:42:43 can anyone help me with my mech
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:42:53 i've got an issue with my lava spitters/smoke pipes
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:10 it's fine design wise
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:13 except the rockets on the feet dont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:21 half the things on this thing don't trigger
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:26 even though they're set in the right keybind and everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:37 I was anwyay
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:43:47 do you have to be in PVP for smoke pipes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:03 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:06 so I set them to F
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:07 they dont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:17 turned particles to always and everything
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:20 but I had someone else look
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:23 and they dont fire at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:25 nor do my lava spitters
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:27 nor do my rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:45 half my weapons don't work and my mech can't run any faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:44:47 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:01 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:05 I meant
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:05 rocket ENGINES
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:12 the rockets fired just fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:14 and I checked guns
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:28 gonna go back in and see if it works now but I have rejoined several times
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:45:55 I'm using smoke pipes as well as lava spitters to get the flamethrower effect but neither work as it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:33 they've decided to work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:42 gonna check if my lava spitters work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:55 h thank god
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:46:55 AND MY ROCKETS WORK
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:04 maybe the particles just weren't loading
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:19 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:26 I did
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:27 I turned them on
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:28 didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:30 rejoined, didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:35 it works now
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:41 guessing lava spitters work too
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:47:51 my mech looks so trash
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:04 had to copy the legs because I had no idea how to make decent looking ones that worked or even ones that worke
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:06 worked*
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:48:12 but I know the basic design now
general 2020-07-03 19:20:25 anyone else not able to enter games
general 2020-07-03 19:20:49 all profile images are blank and can't get the launcher to work
general 2020-07-03 19:36:17 anyone else's roblox launcher ever not work
general 2020-07-03 19:36:20 I need help
general 2020-07-03 19:36:26 the stuff roblox reccomends is kinda useless
general 2020-07-03 19:36:33 restarted PC and launcher just commits death
general 2020-07-03 19:36:35 aight
general 2020-07-03 19:36:36 so uh

general 2020-07-03 19:50:23 has anyone ever had an issue where roblox launcher refuses to open
general 2020-07-03 19:50:26 even after reinstalling
general 2020-07-03 19:50:34 never had this in 4 years
general 2020-07-03 19:50:57 we talking about Inno Inc?
general 2020-07-03 19:51:01 honestly the games are dead
general 2020-07-03 19:51:02 not dead but
general 2020-07-03 19:51:07 sounds like the code's a mess
general 2020-07-03 19:51:35 sounds like physics to me
general 2020-07-03 19:51:37 sounds like confusion
general 2020-07-03 19:51:42 what game
general 2020-07-03 19:51:44 arctic base?
general 2020-07-03 19:51:56 oh
general 2020-07-03 19:52:01 it's
general 2020-07-03 19:52:04 it's not a bad game
general 2020-07-03 19:52:07 it's a pretty good game
general 2020-07-03 19:52:13 it's the best thing designing game right now I guess
general 2020-07-03 19:52:14 still
general 2020-07-03 19:52:18 you seen it?
general 2020-07-03 19:52:29 I sound like I'm defending it really hard dont I
general 2020-07-03 19:52:32 ah alr
general 2020-07-03 19:52:35 so what are they saying
general 2020-07-03 19:52:42 a "it's too hard to work on we're gonna bandon it"
general 2020-07-03 19:53:07 ngl arctic base is underwhelming as well
general 2020-07-03 19:53:28 how tf did I miss that
general 2020-07-03 19:53:45 OH
general 2020-07-03 19:53:46 wow
general 2020-07-03 19:53:49 alright
general 2020-07-03 19:54:42 so what are they focused on
general 2020-07-03 19:54:45 IRL stuff or arctic base
general 2020-07-03 19:54:52 not gonna lie arctic base isn't as good as the original labs
general 2020-07-03 19:55:17 yeah
general 2020-07-03 19:55:20 it's pretty good as well
general 2020-07-03 19:55:30 am I allowed to talk about pinewood here
general 2020-07-03 19:56:00 is it really?
general 2020-07-03 19:56:13 it got an update like
general 2020-07-03 19:56:14 last year
general 2020-07-03 19:56:18 overhauling a bunch of stuff
general 2020-07-03 19:56:21 that's the last I heard
general 2020-07-03 19:56:23 yeah but
general 2020-07-03 19:56:26 plane crazy barely gets updated
general 2020-07-03 19:56:29 arctic base barely gets update
general 2020-07-03 19:56:32 they're all dead my guy
general 2020-07-03 19:56:41 it was a pretty big update as well lol
general 2020-07-03 19:56:50 the security regularly gets full servers
general 2020-07-03 19:56:51 but yeah
general 2020-07-03 19:56:53 I just
general 2020-07-03 19:56:55 the games aren't developed
general 2020-07-03 19:57:53 pretty much
general 2020-07-03 19:57:57 the space ship is cool
general 2020-07-03 19:58:54 technically he isn't
general 2020-07-03 19:58:55 wait never mind
general 2020-07-03 19:59:00 he's a high ranker in the sec team I think
general 2020-07-03 19:59:45 spaceship isn't official
general 2020-07-03 20:00:02 <@!413856687737536512> heard of ping
general 2020-07-03 20:00:10 also that's a very hard thing to develop
general 2020-07-03 20:00:12 how do you measure lag
general 2020-07-03 20:00:19 it isn't, is it?
general 2020-07-03 20:00:25 was a fan game last time I heard
general 2020-07-03 20:00:26 nononoon
general 2020-07-03 20:00:30 I mean ping as in 100MS
general 2020-07-03 20:00:44 it's a measure of connection, reaally
general 2020-07-03 20:00:46 but you dont just
general 2020-07-03 20:00:47 measure lag
general 2020-07-03 20:01:03 no games have tht
general 2020-07-03 20:01:06 go into settings
general 2020-07-03 20:01:09 press performance stats
general 2020-07-03 20:01:10 there you go
general 2020-07-03 20:01:11 easy
general 2020-07-03 20:05:07 why are you talking physics
general 2020-07-03 20:05:10 in a roblox server
general 2020-07-03 20:05:11 stop
general 2020-07-03 20:05:11 just
general 2020-07-03 20:05:23 my brain is too small to handle this

general 2020-07-03 20:05:31 wait
general 2020-07-03 20:05:44 are you talking bullshit that makes no sense until someone calls you out or actual physics
general 2020-07-03 20:05:45 I cannot tell
general 2020-07-03 20:08:46 that's kind of
general 2020-07-03 20:08:47 not right
general 2020-07-03 20:08:50 you can't go around saying that

general 2020-08-23 14:28:55 it's time to die
general 2020-12-19 21:50:45 he's making a list
general 2020-12-19 21:50:47 he's checking it twice
general 2020-12-19 21:50:53 he isn't gonna shoot any innocents tonight
bot-central 2021-04-04 21:25:49 -pccmc
bot-central 2021-04-04 21:25:51 sus
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:14:55 does anyone have a working double-rotored heli design
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:14:58 specifically the rotors themselves
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:15:03 any design I look up is outdated as hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:16:30 I think so
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:16:35 that's one stacked on top of the other, right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:17:57 yeah I have no idea how to make them work
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:19:17 yeah see that's my problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:19:19 they don't work
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:19:23 i don't know what I'm doing wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:19:49 they spin at the same time in the same direction
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:20:25 that's what I've done
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:20:29 that's what I've done
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:20:44 two in the middle are locked, right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:20:50 epicguy3626
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:02 the two rotors in the middle are locked
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:08 unless I can stack them directly on top of each other now?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:26 ignore the atrocious design of the heli itself
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:29 
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:50 so the one at the bottom is unlocked, with left shift to go forward and control to go backward, 10 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:21:57 the one at the top is that but reversed and 20 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:22:09 the ones in the middle are both locked, and the ones attached directly to the wing panels I didn't touch
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:23:01 RIGHT
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:23:28 thank god
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:23:32 thanks lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:24:34 oh yeah I am lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:24:44 the build itself sucks ass but like
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:24:57 to get more lift, just add more panels right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:26:51 ayy it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:26:53 please no
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:27:12 and do I need a tail rotor to let it turn, or do I add wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:27:55 <@!651361636657135617> and how do I get it to get off the ground easier without just tipping forward and scraping
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:27:57 yepah, add them to both sides
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:27:59 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:28:02 *taps head*
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:28:08 facing downward?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:28:27 ok but
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:28:30 engine, what to do with
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:39:14 yeah I'm a complete newbie
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:39:42 but uhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:39:43 like
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:39:50 there aren't really any tutorials detailing a hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:40:57 there's more?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:40:59 didn't think there was more
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:41:11 aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 19:41:12 ty
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:20:47 i wonder if my heli is too fat to get off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:21:10 it doesn't want to raise into the air
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:22:48 sadge
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:22:48 can't send screenshots
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:23:07 how do I make it less heavy?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:23:13 using ballast blocks and then making them light?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:26:00 i'm not entirely sure my rotors are even generating any lift at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:27:18 they look right
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:27:22 but aren't generating any lift whatsoever
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:27:59 gonna try helicopter blades
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:29:28 that's what I mean yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:29:32 i was using flat wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:29:34 that was likely the problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:30:12 they aren't doing anything
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:30:17 do I need to make them bigger
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:30:19 i wonder
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:31:06 do they have to face a specific way
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:31:08 im getting no lift
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:31:19 its light enough to slowly float down
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:31:33 and now I rotate speedily
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:31:39 at least I'm moving
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:32:45 i gotta go in like
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:32:47 a minute
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:32:51 im gonna check if flipping the placement works
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:34:05 nah it doesn't fix it
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:34:08 i'll friend ypou then
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:34:52 cya
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 20:34:52 sent a friend request
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:51:25 so my helicopter rotors dont actually move the helicopter off the groundf
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:51:29 they just nudge it a bit
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:51:31 there's no updraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:51:33 can anyone help with that
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:51:48 they spin it around a bunch
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:52:10 i have
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:52:21 propellor blades make the heli spin in circles
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:52:23 like really fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:52:27 as though its single bladed
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:52:49 I have
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:53:11 I HAVE
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:53:11 what's dual propellor contra rotating
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:53:16 I have
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:53:34 they never mentioned the hover drive for a dual rotor
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:53:53 never mind
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:55:46 ok, so real quicjk
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:55:51 if the propellor lifts the helicopter backward
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:55:54 and tilts the nose up
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:56:01 should I move the rotors forward a block
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:56:04 right
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:56:05 ty
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:39 finally
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:40 it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 19:02:39 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 17:08:04 pretty satisfying to make something that actually works ngl
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 17:08:26 my heli controls reasonably smoothly, even if it's a bit slow, but I can hit targets on the ground easily so
