creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:49:29 > you only upvote a build if its realistic
that's not a bad thing, because it forces you to practice more and learn more mechanisms, thus making you get better
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:49:54 also, not only if it's realistic
creations-chat 2020-05-03 20:50:04 many fictional builds got into <#627195143040139264>

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:32 you're not
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:43 no

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:14:00 then tell me
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:14:04 what kind of suspension is this
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:14:06

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:36:55 2. you try to be a smartass in fields you clearly don't understand, only spreading misinformation
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:40:21 you certainly do spread a lot of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:40:28 you said "bellcrank? lol doesn't even exist"
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:40:39 you call everything an oscillating bogie
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:40:58 you called a swingarm and a coil "christie suspension"
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:41:01 which is wrong on many levels
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:41:59 i'm not?

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:37:14 mmm
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:37:32 it was meant to be in place of 210 but inconsistencies with engine flame cans meant engine no bueno
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:38:03 if the flame cans were buffed out you would've seen these flying around instead of 210s
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:38:21 herisson if you found tell me

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:43:38 you found it
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:43:47 that's the plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:43:59 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:44:06 that's why it wasn't used
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:44:12 because engine flame cans died
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:44:25 so the first prototype completed was used with DB engines
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:44:29 but was destroyed in bombings

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:51:21 you acting kinda sus ngl
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 10:51:26 i say we vote blue
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:22:49 well then it's not an AC-130
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:22:58 then it's just a plane that looks kind of like an AC-130

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:23:30 i still fail to see why that's a problem
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:23:42 you make things from real life, so you would assume trying to make it as close as possible is normal
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:25:02 tell that to guggi and his harriers
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:25:08 motor lock is a thing

creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:33:43 that abrams chassis is an insult to tank suspension

creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:40:46 actually, tank treads DO give benefits
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:00 -better suspension performance since roadwheels are unpowered
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:04 -ability to cross trenches
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:10 -a lot of style points
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:24 not very well
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:33 they are
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:41:34 actually
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:42:25 suspension is very wacky if the wheels you put on it are powered
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:44:12 bruh
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:44:19 tanks can't be AWD like cars
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:44:23 the small wheels on the bottom
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:44:25 can't be powered
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:44:39 since there is no way to efficiently provide power, nor is there any reason to
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:16 you model things from real life
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:20 you should stick to how they made things
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:45:50 we were talking about the benefits of treads
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:06 i know
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:38 why would you use treads for pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:46:48 that's just dumb
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:47:04 they're not glitchy if you make them correctly
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:47:11 and they're not that slow unless you make them gigantic
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:12 also, different styles of treads can alter the physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:18 if you don't use that many motors, it'll lag less
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:48:28 but in turn will make the ride less smooth
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:04 also, to show just how easy it is to cross large gaps: https://gyazo.com/2b5c4d09d0d2ced80531d0cf1bb4e019
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:53 no
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:49:58 yes
creations-chat 2020-09-23 12:50:14 sometimes you can barely cross rails with only cylinders
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:11:25 very easy actually
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:21 that's only christie suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:30 some tanks didn't even use coils
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:44 mm
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:13:47 that's fine
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:18:26 motor2s with low torque and 50 speed can act as suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:19:04 stuff like leafsprings bounce back immediately
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:11 hmm
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:17 i might need to conduct further testing
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:20:28 but i've mostly always used 50 speed for motorized suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:21:52 https://gyazo.com/b01653e40c7bd1f23cab8213ba0bfb84
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:21:58 i used 50 speed on this
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:22:27 ^^ the only problem i can find with suspension above is that it can break when encountering too much force, causing the half wedges to just phase through the cylinder
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:23:17 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:23:52 yeah, you have a point
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:04 depends on the amount of roadwheels
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:11 if you have a lot, you'll probably need less
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:25:34 i use 0.2 on the suspension above and i needed 8 ballast blocks on max to make it smoother
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:26:08 what
creations-chat 2020-09-23 13:33:32 very cool

creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:40:43 that launching sequence looks great
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:41:29 only for that?
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:41:46 it's still good
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:42:45 it's undeserved of a downvote, it's a great mechanical feat
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:45:42 it works well = a great mechanical feat
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:47:39 according to your logic
not seeing the katyusha means you wouldn't be able to distinguish if it looks like one or not
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:48:34 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:48:54 you can just, ping him and ask for a picture
creations-chat 2020-10-10 22:51:24 oh yeah no, i was just curious that's all
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:09:25 flex
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:29:12 no actually, pyro has quite the life
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:31:07 <@!714763671410180127> understand why you would think that, but I did in fact post mine earlier
ps, i like do your 110 g-2 doe
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:34:58 haha funny 3rd grader "ur're girl" insult
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:35:54 oh yeah no i meant that to the people on the other side of this argument
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:36:46 get it? it's because the flag displayed is also used as the flag for LGBTQ+ and it's implying that the people recieving it are gay
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:37:46 change my mind: "better remove that self upvote" memes with deep fried images of creations were never funny
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:38:57 finally, someone that agrees
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:39:51 as much of a disgrace as it is, if you're not a mod then just ignore it
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:40:08 it's just causing more fuss than needed
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:41:34 oh yeah you can call it out, but straight up sending a mob after some fucking guy who decided to react with a green arrow is kind of like sending a first time felon to the gallows
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:43:43 pyro your treads be kinda falling off
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:44:00 use tread guide pegs smh smh smh
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:44:25 but yes very nice pershing
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:47:55 your treads were angling in ways that did not seem healthy
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:51:11 i straight up eat that bump
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:51:46 only different suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:52:02 i have bellcrank not christie

creations-chat 2020-10-10 23:59:47 there
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:00:09 also
delicious, finally some good fucking food https://gyazo.com/5c7f2b7cd72e7d2cbab8025c5174df61
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:05:56 big christie suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:06:59 if i add weight it might sink deeper
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:07:19 because i don't have any on it yet, also i have extra long spring
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:09:12 sinke
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:12:11 motorized suspension is pog too
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:12:55 not that much actually
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:13:40 if you optimize your tensioning and suspension you can get pretty surprising results
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:13:57 the tighter the more laggier usually
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:14:14 atleast that's what i felt with a small chassis
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:14:59 if you use a sprocket wheel with decently saggy treads you can get up to 80% physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:15:41 speed incarnate https://gyazo.com/60c58e0ef1895842c0ce769973730f63
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:17:08 people often think treads = your computer die but in reality it's probably because they made them too large / too tight
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:18:23 if i tighten my treads fully this is how fast i go https://gyazo.com/96f960da8bf2dda14199f884c344301a
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:18:40 but physics throttle also kicks in near the end of the clip
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:19:21 IIRC roblox runs mostly on your CPU
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:19:37 so yes, but then again my cpu is from an office pc
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:20:10 yikes
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:20:48 droop
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:21:05 also just trial and error, you'll need to adjust your springs
creations-chat 2020-10-11 00:22:30 i use springs with 70 damping, 50 stiffness and 6.5 length, but i have weight equivalent to 1 full ballast beam

plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:43:28 with all of these new people the PCC is changing for the worse
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:43:59 tank suspension = from real life
making tank suspension from real life = gets you called a fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:44:00 headass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:44:11 because i'm interested in it?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:44:18 your ass spreading misinformation doesn't help anyone
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:44:43 they're so far apart from each other lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:45:10 christie on the BT series used bellcranks you fucking mongoloid
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:45:27 i'd call you a caveman but that'd be an insult to them
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:45:39 you're genuinely the smartass on the playground that doesn't actually know shit
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:46:09 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:46:12 you call a  swingarm and a spring christie suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:46:15 fucking dumbass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:46:36 xxjojoxx being mentally deficient and being a general smartass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:47:20 because whatever the fuck oscillating bogie is, it's not made for tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:47:39 it's made for tractors you dumbass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:47:50 **shower in french**
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:47:51 ass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:11 you called the churchill's suspension christie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:15 and you claim to know tank suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:16 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:40 you said "i'm better than prototrode" quite a few times in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:48 so jojo, if you're ACTUALLY as good as prototrode, describe christie suspension for me
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:48:56 if you succeed, i will back down
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:49:46 is this what you're on about?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:06 because this is for fucking trains
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:12 ok then, show me
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:44 and just because it's on the maus it's on every tank with bogies?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:51:41 watch him blame it on google
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:51:44 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:52:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:52:40 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:52:46 dunno about you chief but those don't look similar
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:02 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:11 xxjojoxx claims the maus had oscillating bogie suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:28 despite google showing not one picture of the maus suspension when we searched for oscillating bogie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:54 do you not see
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:03 the roadwheels 1/3 the size of a human
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:11 the springs that are mounted horizontally
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:21 the direction of motion
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:40 did you just make up "real life fanatism" to give yourself an excuse to build shit?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:43 headass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:03 he was advertising himself in vip1 earlier
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:10 jojo you're delusional
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:27 because the things we're mentioning **are from real life**
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:50 snowflake ass
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:56:08 in the old days we got told to "go fuck yourself" and you had to live with it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:56:14 well, not old
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:56:28 but before the easter event and the influx of undes joining
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:56:52 how?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:57:04 you get offended after you get told to correct your facts
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:57:17 then you act like you're the all mighty overlord of reality
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:34 you call every spring suspension christie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:48 i don't blame anyone
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:55 i find myself weird for having this interest
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:03 if you just ask me, nicely, then i'll help you
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:07 the only reason i blame you
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:11 is because you're epitome of asshole
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:53 it's not as simple as that
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:00:20 the springs are mounted horizontally for a reason
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:00:26 it changes everything
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:00:37 if you actually understand it, you would know why things are as they are
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:01:47 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:03 how
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:22 christie has large roadwheels with no return rollers, and it uses large springs for great travel motion
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:28 that uses a bellcrank
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:31 as i mentioned before
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:05 that's from the front roadwheel of a BT tank or one of christie's earlier tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:10 and it does use a bellcrank
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:52 that's just not it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:04:07 what is that from
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:06:00 is that a panzer 4 with a flak 88
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:06:42 pog
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:07:34 then that's not suspension if it doesn't have anything to absorb the impact
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:08:35 suspension is for absorbing the impact and smoothening the ride, by not having anything to absorb it it's not suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:08:47 if there was nothing there then the tank would just collapse
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:00 if it was just hinges it would die
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:16 i can demonstrate
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:58 https://gyazo.com/c5ba416c255440e1c43bdfe994db37e7
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:25 no springs or anything = nothing to hold it up, causing it to malfunction
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:33 HVSS doesn't have one hinge
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:35 it's two hinges
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:49 also that wouldn't absorb impact whatsoever
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:11:41 that's still not suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:11:58 the wheels taking shape of the terrain isn't suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:12:57 cambridge isn't an expert on suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:14:28 why it's not suspension part 1
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:14:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:14:46 the wheels don't move
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:14:48 only rotate
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:15:01 that doesn't change it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:15:10 this is the one "suspension" where it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:15:14 because it's not suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:15:24 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:18:24 almost done
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:20:28 i got a mild concussion just from watching it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:20:57 miserable
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:21:12 the bumpiest ride i've taken in a virtual tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:22:07 the middle bogie wasn't touching the tread half the time
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:22:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:22:32 as seen here
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:22:54 i fucking hate it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:22:57 give me my bellcrank back
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:24:10 much better

help 2020-11-14 15:56:00 1 sec
help 2020-11-14 15:59:02 if you put a wheel on a swingarm that's attached to a motor2 with low torque servo+toggle it can act as suspension
help 2020-11-14 15:59:04 https://gyazo.com/9139b77c7d2c8d6b565c1029114cce6b
help 2020-11-14 15:59:31 it's used for tank suspension mainly
help 2020-11-14 16:02:32 there's also indirect motor2 suspension
help 2020-11-14 16:04:06 where the motor at the base is completely unpowered, and the thing that actually behaves like a spring is a rod on the swingarm itself pushing against a block https://gyazo.com/3d9bfc7968aa6001e38ec9a630a6b5a7

general 2020-12-07 01:34:03 always look for the tail
general 2020-12-07 01:34:06 on german planes
general 2020-12-07 01:34:14 that's where they put the funny symbol
general 2020-12-07 01:34:25 look at the rudder
general 2020-12-07 01:34:26 shadow
general 2020-12-07 01:34:42 it's still there

general 2020-12-07 01:35:03 we're not offended to see it
general 2020-12-07 01:35:16 but it's a symbol that doesn't represent good things nonetheless
general 2020-12-07 01:35:53 the mods don't think like that
general 2020-12-07 01:35:57 is the problem
general 2020-12-07 01:36:09 see if the rules were decided by us
general 2020-12-07 01:36:12 nobody would give a shit
general 2020-12-07 01:36:18 no
general 2020-12-07 01:36:23 there was the nono symbol
general 2020-12-07 01:37:06 i agree
general 2020-12-07 01:37:07 however
general 2020-12-07 01:37:18 many people suffered by the people that wore those symbols
general 2020-12-07 01:37:32 it's better to not remind them
general 2020-12-07 01:38:04 ww2 is still something that lingers on to this day
general 2020-12-07 01:38:32 yes
general 2020-12-07 01:38:35 but still
general 2020-12-07 01:38:37 the mods don't agree
general 2020-12-07 01:39:07 they'll probably say no
general 2020-12-07 01:39:20 since it's still an offensive symbol

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:17:02 or a hummel
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:17:07 or a nashorn
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:17:48 if you give up that easily of course you won't get any
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:18:16 the pcc is a place with high standards
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:18:22 you should expect nothing less
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:19:45 i feel it's justified sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:20:38 there are exceptions
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:21:16 also, people just upvote/downvote based on if they like it or not
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:21:25 having a lot of downvotes just means people didn't like it
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:22:00 god left us the moment ogs started getting banned
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:22:53 it means there's gonna be a lot of people who don't understand the "og pcc humor"
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:00 and are gonna become sensitive af
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:31 sad
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:36 i miss the old pcc humor
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:46 where you get shat on as a joke and both of you laugh
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:24:04 noooooo!

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:25:37 yuh
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:25:59 more people = more of a chance to be upvoted
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:26:10 25 upvote designer 5 would be ez af today
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:26:21 because there's so many new people who came from the easter event
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:26:28 but back in like 2019 september
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:26:30 that was hard

plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:44:12 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:44:36 that's just when winter **actually** starts
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:44:39 astronomically
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:44:49 dec 1st is just when winter starts in the calendar
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:44:53 they're not lined up
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:45:23 google
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:45:30 or if you've completed your 8th grade
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:45:35 physics class
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:45:36 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:46:02 probably
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:46:18 physics is actually really fuckin' useful
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:46:42 like when trying to learn an instrument, if you know the fundementals of frequency and resonance it's gonna be a lot easier understanding
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:47:42 literally not one person in this chat asked
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:48:33 probably not
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:48:43 unless your folds aren't in the way
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:49:08 that just looks literally horrible
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:49:20 "cringe" boeing nose technique looks 10x better than that
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:50:20 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:50:52 triangle wedge+wedgeblock is better for stuff like tanks
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:50:55 because of it's angles
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:51:02 and sharpness
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:02 that doesn't exactly answer the question
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:03 but ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:48 giving up is one of the worst things you could do
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:59 that means you're going to progress even less than before
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:58:22 to practice, to get better
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:59:29 but like
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:59:38 practicing is the epitome of a gradual climb
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:59:40 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:00:19 how
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:00:58 nobody expects you to be a perfectionist
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:01:18 after all, there's always something you can pick out in even the best of builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:01:50 but most of the community expects the build to be recognizeable
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:01:51 also
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:02:02 many people forget upvotes and downvotes are just subjective opinions
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:02:43 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:02:47 they just don't like it
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:02:50 you all overthink it way too much
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:03:01 and we end up at the same place, talking about the same topic
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:03:24 there's literally nothing else to it
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:03:34 if they like it: upvote
if they don't: no vote or downvote
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:03:41 it's not rocket science
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:12 also, in terms of "practice makes perfect"
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:20 me, a long time ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:30 also me, a few weeks ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:42 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:47 because i think it looked fucking disgusting
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:12:45 your first is still experience that you're gaining and learning from
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:14:33 thing is with guitar, that's very different and you can also play things differently
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:14:41 you can perfect **a way** to play a song
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:15:00 but not perfect the song itself, unless you literally dedicate your life to it
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:20:48 it's not an argument though obc

general 2021-03-26 19:36:42 I can't compete with him
general 2021-03-26 19:40:54 are you coding?
general 2021-03-26 19:41:15 both piano and guitar players can agree that keytars are utterly moronic
general 2021-03-26 19:41:31 perhaps
general 2021-03-26 19:41:50 are there guitars on roblos
general 2021-03-26 19:42:39 holy shit I know the model of this
general 2021-03-26 19:43:11 
general 2021-03-26 19:43:23 only difference is headstock

general 2021-03-26 19:44:28 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
general 2021-03-26 19:45:08 wym
general 2021-03-26 19:45:21 not really
general 2021-03-26 19:45:25 music and being swag
general 2021-03-26 19:47:23 I have a guitar that's really in my sights rn
general 2021-03-26 19:47:33 
general 2021-03-26 19:47:35 looks fucking swag
general 2021-03-26 19:48:02 I kinda like that look
general 2021-03-26 19:48:26 perhaps
general 2021-03-26 19:48:38 but you can make it look fucking sick
general 2021-03-26 19:48:40 
general 2021-03-26 19:48:52 only 1
general 2021-03-26 19:49:00 saving for more
general 2021-03-26 19:49:15 mostly electronics and wood on the body
general 2021-03-26 19:49:43 different pickups give different effects and the type of the wood can change how long the note sustains itself
general 2021-03-26 19:50:29 or if you're eddie van halen and you saw a triangle in the bottom of your guitar, you can completely ruin the sound
general 2021-03-26 19:50:53 guitar sheets are the easiest thing you can imagine
general 2021-03-26 19:50:58 we don't need sheet music
general 2021-03-26 19:51:03 as it doesn't correlate well
general 2021-03-26 19:51:43 yikes
general 2021-03-26 19:52:23 I would assume it's a lot easier to read sheet music for a piano player since the keys are fixed and you can't alter them much
general 2021-03-26 19:53:25 guitar tabs are basically that
general 2021-03-26 19:53:29 which is why we're cooler
general 2021-03-26 19:54:25 
general 2021-03-26 19:54:29 guitar players are blessed
general 2021-03-26 19:55:00 probably
general 2021-03-26 19:55:18 yeah apparently they do
general 2021-03-26 19:55:20 
general 2021-03-26 19:56:42 remember how I said being a guitar player is easy
general 2021-03-26 19:56:43 I lied
general 2021-03-26 19:56:45 
general 2021-03-26 19:57:01 yes
general 2021-03-26 19:57:39 you might be a bass man then
general 2021-03-26 19:57:53 damn
general 2021-03-26 19:59:02 yooo sick
general 2021-03-26 19:59:13 I don't do bass but probably cool
general 2021-03-26 20:00:17 looks nice
general 2021-03-26 20:00:24 I like that pick guard
general 2021-03-26 20:00:52 I want to try painting my own guitar sometime
general 2021-03-26 20:00:59 but not my current one
general 2021-03-26 20:01:04 my cort x1 will stay as it is
general 2021-03-26 20:02:59 I got new guitar picks
general 2021-03-26 20:03:02 :letsgo:
general 2021-03-26 20:03:04 oh right
general 2021-03-26 20:03:08 no nitro
general 2021-03-26 20:05:44 
general 2021-03-26 20:06:00 1.5mm
general 2021-03-26 20:06:07 I like the heavy ones cause they don't bend
general 2021-03-26 20:06:16 these ones are pvc and don't fuck with my skin
general 2021-03-26 20:07:01 ok
general 2021-03-26 20:09:42 
general 2021-03-26 20:10:33 nah just a regular super strat
general 2021-03-26 20:11:22 telecasters look kinda weird to me
general 2021-03-26 20:11:40 well yeah
general 2021-03-26 20:11:50 I'm not even a metallica person
general 2021-03-26 20:11:52 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2021-03-26 20:16:53 I do like my music
general 2021-03-26 20:16:55 how could I not
general 2021-03-26 20:17:03 I will strangle you
general 2021-03-26 20:17:14 WHAT
general 2021-03-26 20:17:25 most is pretty garbage yeah
general 2021-03-26 20:17:37 death metal is literally unlistenable
general 2021-03-26 20:18:30 seeing someone turn gain, lows, and highs to max and mids to none is equal to a piece of my soul dying
general 2021-03-26 20:19:22 for whom the bell tolls or seek & destroy
general 2021-03-26 20:19:37 first riff is criminally underrated
general 2021-03-26 20:19:42 perhaps
general 2021-03-26 20:19:50 I do like a bit of my megadeth
general 2021-03-26 20:20:05 yes
general 2021-03-26 20:20:33 can you put a price on peace?
general 2021-03-26 20:23:00 pog
general 2021-03-26 20:25:08 yoo that looks nice
general 2021-03-26 20:25:28 jackson Vs look kinda dope
general 2021-03-26 20:26:06 some of those look real nice
general 2021-03-26 20:26:27 les paul or lp for short
general 2021-03-26 20:27:43 guitar is a wide world that you'll find yourself in just by playing what you want
general 2021-03-26 20:27:52 going to a teacher can also give you motivation
general 2021-03-26 20:28:27 play whatever you want, and challenge yourself as much as you can
general 2021-03-26 20:28:48 I occasionally have my uncle who's a very big guitar player teach me
general 2021-03-26 20:29:17 I started on an electroacoustic playing smoke on the water
general 2021-03-26 20:29:19 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-03-26 20:29:48 it's a cort x1
general 2021-03-26 20:30:07 discontinued so <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-03-26 20:31:54 I fear I might have developed hetfield hand
general 2021-03-26 20:32:06 only downpicking
general 2021-03-26 20:32:08 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-03-26 20:32:57 my left hand is literally callouses and nothing else
general 2021-03-26 20:33:05 I literally test knives on the tip of my finger
general 2021-03-26 20:33:10 that's how hard it has become
general 2021-03-26 20:33:21 no
general 2021-03-26 20:33:32 callouses develop on the fretting hand
general 2021-03-26 20:33:39 there's literally none on my right hand
general 2021-03-26 20:34:16 most beginner guitars are actually pretty decent, not sure about amps
general 2021-03-26 20:34:48 yeah
general 2021-03-26 20:34:57 most are pretty decent
general 2021-03-26 20:35:06 uh
general 2021-03-26 20:35:35 not sure if a pickup can power headphones with the pretty weak signals it gives
general 2021-03-26 20:35:59 but you're probably able to plug it into some kind of unit
general 2021-03-26 20:36:03 idk never used them with headphones
general 2021-03-26 20:36:17 I have a 30W NuX Frontline 30
general 2021-03-26 20:36:26 perhaps
general 2021-03-26 20:36:35 yeah actually amps usually have headphone ports
general 2021-03-26 20:36:44 however they're 6.3mm jacks usually
general 2021-03-26 20:36:51 the thick ones
general 2021-03-26 20:37:08 pog treads btw but nice traction <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-03-26 20:37:25 yeah that will probably work then
general 2021-03-26 20:38:10 my friend has a peavey rage 158 but it doesn't have distortion so if you're going for metal you will need a distortion pedal
general 2021-03-26 20:38:17 his guitar is a flight est11
general 2021-03-26 20:38:43 hungary
general 2021-03-26 20:38:48 yeah ik where tf is that
general 2021-03-26 20:39:14 sick pick guard
general 2021-03-26 20:39:37 it's going to differ depending on your devotion
general 2021-03-26 20:40:02 I already sold my soul to the guitar lords
general 2021-03-26 20:40:07 nothing
general 2021-03-26 20:40:15 it's a compilation album
general 2021-03-26 20:40:24 depends on what you want
general 2021-03-26 20:40:31 uh
general 2021-03-26 20:40:38 do you want the pick to flex a little or not
general 2021-03-26 20:40:52 go ahead
general 2021-03-26 20:41:48 I literally refuse to play fingerstyle on a guitar made for metal
general 2021-03-26 20:42:06 I cannot play fingerstyle

general 2021-03-26 20:55:24 the one thing I can give to british people
general 2021-03-26 20:55:28 is that their metal is good
general 2021-03-26 20:56:24 iron maiden, judas priest, black sabbath, queen
general 2021-03-26 20:56:27 all were british
general 2021-03-26 20:57:01 perhaps
general 2021-03-26 20:57:43 british rock/metal just has a lot more color than american metal
general 2021-03-26 20:57:45 except megadeth
general 2021-03-26 20:57:50 megadeth is exceptional
general 2021-03-26 20:58:36 come back to me when you have your mids back <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-04-22 20:08:36 so there are a lot more things to shoot at than players

general 2021-05-11 11:25:14 yes, but doesn't mean you can be toxic towards them

creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:13:04 while I do agree with you zach, you also need to calm the fuck down you skyscraper
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:13:12 here I come to ruin the fun
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:14:52 I'm actually going to be political and defend zach, because in reality zach is as good of a builder (if not better) as he claims
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:15:56 shut the fuck up
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:16:08 give him like a few days and he'll probably craft something cursed as shit, motorlocked to hell, and pixel measured as much as possible
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:16:21 also pcc standards are not increasing, in fact they are decreasing
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:17:05 never said it was a good excuse for him, but he also hasn't posted anything since the creations submitter bot, which was atleast >6 months ago
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:17:16 judging him on those is quite frankly, dumb
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:18:01 also, always take creations feedback with huge grains of salt, as you'll always recieve toxicity and throwing kerozine on the fire will not help anyone's case
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:18:30 I'm not really allowing it
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:18:41 I did tell him to, I quote, "shut the fuck up you skyscraper"
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:19:00 also please shut the fuck up with the "as a mod" bullshit
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:19:06 I am so incredibly tired of hearing it
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:19:16 makes me sound inhuman and more like a dictator
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:20:19 <@!287454032250011649> it's getting annoying and some of the "funny" sentences you make are very borderline suggestive
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:20:25 I advise you to stop
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:27:06 considering this is a friendly debate where we're not jumping at each other's necks, that sentence is not really helping anyone
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:51:43 here I come again to ruin the fun
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:51:47 continue in dms or die

the-dump 2021-05-13 21:59:47 I know, but I will still proceed to shut him up
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:14 as it does not make him cool, or hip, or a better builder
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:16 it's annoying
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:00:22 not quite
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:01 I will
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:06 because the channel was fucking unusable
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:15 and there's no other way to silence a bunch of drugged toddlers
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:01:27 dump is inside pcc
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:02:11 I do not give a shit if people are annoyed
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:02:40 I am forced to become a dictator and silence people because they do not listen
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:00 "benefit of the community"
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:18 you do not know how much better the community would be if I was a **true** discord moderator
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:03:53 spoiler, I would ban people the first moment I see them while I'm in a bad mood
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:14 you would not last 5 seconds if that were the case
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:17 just saying
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:04:34 as far as I remember, this is the first time I got truly angry
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:05:24 I will do 5 hour next time with gratis ban spree <:hypertrollface:778903165017260043>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:25 also, you forgot one thing
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:26 
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:36 I DID do a faster slowmode earlier
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:41 too bad you were blind to notice that
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:54 no it did
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:06:56 but it did nothing
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:03 so I resorted to the forced silence
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:22 had puri or mega arrived here, it would be an absolute massacre
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:56 not obc really
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:07:58 he busy man
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:08:56 no he would've went back in the chain and he would've warned people for each <:trollface:775024642104229898> that you unhinged brainlets did
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:09:30 not too late
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:09:33 <:hypertrollface:778903165017260043>
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:10:14 massive trollface spam, it was unusable and people are mad I had to silence it

the-dump 2021-05-13 22:19:50 I warned you all
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:19:55 have fun with the 5 hour slowmode
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:20:08 no time for feeling sorry
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:21:04 ask rbk or another mod to remove in due time
the-dump 2021-05-13 22:21:13 however they'll agree with me (probably)
general 2021-05-13 22:24:17 considering I warned you pretty clearly, it's staying
general 2021-05-13 22:24:18 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-05-13 22:24:48 we have naturally high tolerance, but when it's a mob of actual children not doing what you advise them to, it can get on your nerves
general 2021-05-13 22:25:08 boy am I going to have a salt feast tomorrow
general 2021-05-13 22:25:26 me banning you isn't going to affect you irl <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-05-13 22:25:36 no
general 2021-05-13 22:25:40 you reap what you sow
general 2021-05-13 22:25:58 people spammed trollface nonstop for 5 minutes, making the channel unusable
general 2021-05-13 22:26:00 I put slowmode
general 2021-05-13 22:26:01 people angy
general 2021-05-13 22:26:11 I warn people to not do it again
general 2021-05-13 22:26:13 they do it again
general 2021-05-13 22:26:27 I told them that they'd have 5 hour slowmode if I saw it again
general 2021-05-13 22:26:32 rbk agreed with me
general 2021-05-13 22:26:45 what political influence
general 2021-05-13 22:26:57 ok
general 2021-05-13 22:26:59 cry about it
general 2021-05-13 22:27:28 because people ruin it for others

general 2021-05-15 18:17:27 WHY
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:28:34 I'd actually say the standard ones are worth building more over the zach treads
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:28:48 not really
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:28:56 they're 2x the block count of the regular ones
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:29:54 the regular ones look not nearly as bad as you think though

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:32:14 I object
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:32:21 with the correct sizing and build work, they can look very nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:32:34 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:32:37 they're regular ones

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:36:01 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:36:02 then
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:36:52 people usually make tanks massive anyway
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:37:54 also thin treads need a lot of work to work properly
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:37:59 plus you need ugly fabric wheels
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:38:18 they look nice, sure, but are pretty unreliable
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:38:32 not really
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 19:38:38 but it'll look more accurate with the scale

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:50:36 it goes for both sides
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:51:37 look at the zach debate yesterday; while you could've gone outside, touched grass and inhaled oxygen, people were literally shitting on zach for having an opinion and saying it
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:51:50 while he was continuing it, the other sides did it aswell
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:52:43 yes, which is why I have to resort to being uncool dictator

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:08 tnt armor is a pretty essential part of pvp, ruling people out who use them as people with "skill issues" is pretty dumb
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:19 it is
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:23 for ground vehicles atleast
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:31 planes don't need armor because they have agility
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:43 but ground targets are far more vulnerable because they're constricted to the map
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:47:02 you're good at using them I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:47:48 it's kind of like calling a knight a coward after you challenged him with a robe on
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:50:12 why are you crying about tnt armor again
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:50:16 it's really helping nobody
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:52:16 tnt armor builds always have their weaknesses
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:52:23 if you cannot find it, that's not their skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:30 again, you're calling people cowards for using everything to their advantage
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:41 it's not a "trial by combat"
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:44 it's not supposed to be fair
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:52 fairness depends on how good you can make a build
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:59 in my opinion, yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:54:19 if you cannot counter them, that's your issue

general 2021-05-27 00:30:23 what
general 2021-05-27 00:30:33 I cannot differentiate american tanks!
general 2021-05-27 00:31:10 real
general 2021-05-27 00:31:51 rot in hell
general 2021-05-27 00:31:57 panther turret is ü§Æ
general 2021-05-27 00:32:25 they look nice but don't perform all too well
general 2021-05-27 00:32:39 no swedish tanks should die
general 2021-05-27 00:32:54 except for the odd light tank and shit
general 2021-05-27 00:33:00 now hungarian tanks
general 2021-05-27 00:33:02 truly underrated
general 2021-05-27 00:33:13 ~~let's not mention the toldi though~~
general 2021-05-27 00:33:34 bruh murica tank users have the largest ego I have ever seen
general 2021-05-27 00:33:41 ew
general 2021-05-27 00:34:01 bruh most soviet tanks are made of strong steel but they're not made very well
general 2021-05-27 00:34:37 see you say that
general 2021-05-27 00:34:44 but panzers are literally boxes
general 2021-05-27 00:34:51 only the odd panther has actual sloped armor
general 2021-05-27 00:34:57 if you cannot kill one, that's a skill issue
general 2021-05-27 00:35:18 yeah but at tiger 2 br you already have centurions and shit
general 2021-05-27 00:35:22 borderline mbts
general 2021-05-27 00:35:44 I would dare say german tanks require more skill than russian tanks
general 2021-05-27 00:36:00 the whole soviet bias thing came from that statement
general 2021-05-27 00:36:20 have you used a panther
general 2021-05-27 00:36:31 bruh
general 2021-05-27 00:36:47 1 or 2 matches don't really mean shit
general 2021-05-27 00:37:24 like most soviet tanks are objectively better in war thunder than german tanks
general 2021-05-27 00:37:39 tigers are fucking easy to kill if the person using them is dumb and doesn't angle
general 2021-05-27 00:37:43 yeah that's my point
general 2021-05-27 00:38:11 gERMANY SUFFERS <a:waaah:821473560006361169>
general 2021-05-27 00:38:18 then what's your point
general 2021-05-27 00:38:29 panthers have good guns but are not too survivable
general 2021-05-27 00:39:03 yeah
general 2021-05-27 00:39:17 which means you need more skill to hide those spots and know when to engage and not
general 2021-05-27 00:39:26 you can be in a soviet tank and brainlessly rack up a double ace
general 2021-05-27 00:39:40 yeah exactly
general 2021-05-27 00:39:57 they're using their brains and not engaging the enemy at point blank where they know very well that they'll die
general 2021-05-27 00:41:23 t-34s are really fucking good in war thunder
general 2021-05-27 00:41:26 a bit too good I dare say
general 2021-05-27 00:41:53 yeah
general 2021-05-27 00:42:00 which means german tanks, require more skill than soviet ones
general 2021-05-27 00:42:08 they have far more flaws than soviet ones, in war thunder
general 2021-05-27 00:42:30 no not really, if people actually used their brains
general 2021-05-27 00:42:55 what
general 2021-05-27 00:43:02 no I know
general 2021-05-27 00:43:03 but still
general 2021-05-27 00:43:41 you always hear people say germany suffers but never russia suffers
general 2021-05-27 00:43:53 which ultimately means that german tanks need more skill than russian ones
general 2021-05-27 00:44:04 <a:waaah:821473560006361169>
general 2021-05-27 00:44:11 the ultimate insult
general 2021-05-27 00:44:43 just
general 2021-05-27 00:44:44 no
general 2021-05-27 00:44:47 guns maybe
general 2021-05-27 00:44:50 but armor? hell no
general 2021-05-27 00:45:01 russians have slopes on almost every place they can put it
general 2021-05-27 00:45:25 german tanks are literal lunch boxes
general 2021-05-27 00:45:46 l-11 kinda bad but zis-5 is good
general 2021-05-27 00:45:57 amoung
general 2021-05-27 00:46:34 yes, while russians can get many kill by brainlessly rushing points and spawns

general 2021-05-31 23:50:20 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2021-05-31 23:51:36 "The peng≈ë lost value after World War II, suffering the highest rate of hyperinflation ever recorded. There were several attempts to break down inflation, such as a 75% capital levy in December 1945. However, this did not stop the hyperinflation, and prices continued spiraling out of control, with ever-higher denominations introduced. The denominations milpeng≈ë (one million peng≈ë) and b.-peng≈ë (pronunciation: bilpeng≈ë, one trillion (1000000000000) peng≈ë) were used to alleviate calculations, cut down the number of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed.

The hyperinflation was so out of control that, on average, it took 15 hours for prices to double and 4 days, 5 minutes and 38 seconds for the peng≈ë to lose 90% of its original value."

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:16:43 consider the following
motor2 suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:17:18 damn ok bro make leafsprings without motor2 then
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:18:11 because it's incredibly easy and takes minimal effort
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:18:24 and provides almost as good of a result, if not better
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:18:36 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:18:38 it literally uses no suspension blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:19:02 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:19:39 it you can't do it then it seems like a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:19:45 considering how effort-free it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:21:33 basically a replacement for suspension blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:21:42 I will show an example in tank suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:22:08 more torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:22:10 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:22:28 
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:22:52 these lever like springs are motor2s
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:23:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:23:10 just showing an example
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:23:36 I dare say motor2 is suspension is far more reliable than spring suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:24:56 the suspension on my breda is also fully motorized
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:25:07 even the double wishbone in front
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:26:41 no not really, do whatever you feel
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:26:56 but I was trying to show xavier that motor2 suspension is far easier and less complex to make than spring suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:27:55 it also uses less moving parts than spring suspension, so it's less laggy on large tanks with treads
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:28:05 üëç
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:29:25 it's also the closest thing you can get to torsion bar suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:29:28 
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:29:36 
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:29:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:30:04 because the thin ones are 2x block count and moving parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:30:05 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:30:31 but you should use whichever track type you want
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:30:37 I just prefer the old ones

the-dump 2021-07-24 18:00:19 most of them are still about as cringe as that guy
the-dump 2021-07-24 18:00:55 but the typical "omg I hate this demographic therefore I will assemble the entire server because I'm too scared to do anything on my own"
the-dump 2021-07-24 18:00:58 is annoying
the-dump 2021-07-24 18:01:00 and idiotic

general 2021-07-24 18:08:50 do you see how dumb your case is
general 2021-07-24 18:27:55 the amount of warns he has on other accounts might make that completely irrelevant
general 2021-07-24 18:29:05 I don't think it was those two that were arguing though

general 2021-08-10 17:44:44 he used jacksons for a while yeah
general 2021-08-10 17:45:06 he had a few signatures but then fender bought jackson

general 2021-08-31 13:57:07 double wishbone
general 2021-08-31 13:57:25 it's either macpherson or double wishbone
general 2021-08-31 13:57:38 actually wait no
general 2021-08-31 13:57:50 hold on I'm getting mixed results
general 2021-08-31 13:58:16 the warthog is really confusing
general 2021-08-31 13:58:18 now that I look at it
general 2021-08-31 13:58:27 good riddance
general 2021-08-31 13:58:51 I have no idea how that steering works
general 2021-08-31 13:59:02 it looks like torsion bar but the steering is always vertical
general 2021-08-31 13:59:06 yeah it would
general 2021-08-31 13:59:10 that shit broke
general 2021-08-31 13:59:28 no you're right
general 2021-08-31 13:59:30 that's fucked up
general 2021-08-31 13:59:45 wasn't that shinji tho
general 2021-08-31 13:59:58 or did both of them do it
general 2021-08-31 14:00:08 lol bozo
general 2021-08-31 14:00:37 you can make that like 5 if you motorize the suspension and use tank steering
general 2021-08-31 14:01:29 you can use motor2 for suspension
general 2021-08-31 14:01:43 far more compact but not usable on some suspension
general 2021-08-31 14:04:06 I have no idea how the steering doesn't just snap out of place
general 2021-08-31 14:04:33 yeah
general 2021-08-31 14:04:37 it would tilt diagonally
general 2021-08-31 14:04:43 which is a big no no
general 2021-08-31 14:05:00 I guess that's the only reasonable explanation
general 2021-08-31 14:05:22 a similar suspension would be that of the EBR, but that's just double wishbone mounted sideways
general 2021-08-31 14:05:51 I could try
general 2021-08-31 14:06:08 I'll be on vip1
general 2021-08-31 14:18:55 I think I got something similar
general 2021-08-31 14:19:24 steers correctly
general 2021-08-31 14:19:32 yeah kinda
general 2021-08-31 14:19:45 I'm on vip1 rn
general 2021-08-31 14:19:47 if you want to see it
general 2021-08-31 14:19:54 it's not the smoothest but it does the job
general 2021-08-31 14:20:36 ah okay
general 2021-08-31 14:23:25 the suspensions attached to the steering motor are shock absorbers but they're really just there to keep the steering from tilting the wrong way
general 2021-08-31 14:23:48 the actual absorbtion actually happens at these motor 2s
general 2021-08-31 14:24:01 the one at the strut is there so that it can extend
general 2021-08-31 14:24:13 50 speed, 0.3 torque, 10 maxangle and servo+toggle
general 2021-08-31 14:24:52 yeah
general 2021-08-31 14:24:54 0 everything
general 2021-08-31 14:25:28 you can use them as either shock absorbers or you can make it all 0
general 2021-08-31 14:25:33 but that makes the ride a bit bumpier
general 2021-08-31 14:26:04 alright
general 2021-08-31 14:27:21 pretty bouncy but it's usable
general 2021-08-31 14:29:17 a bit better but still bouncy
general 2021-08-31 14:30:05 I'll leave the settings to you but yeah this is the jist of it
general 2021-08-31 14:30:12 and no I haven't played a halo game
general 2021-08-31 14:30:22 I had the original xbox but never played halo
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:46:28 <@!565999170033287320> I'll get some gyazo gifs of it working
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:46:37 this is with motor2s as the main source
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:46:44 https://gyazo.com/b00d3625015003febe2ee552de302b62
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:47:27 handles jumps really well
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:47:47 awd and 4w steering like the real one
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:49:06 I just make suspensions now
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:49:59 I have smoother ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 14:50:40 <:smoothbrain:783036000649740349>
general 2021-08-31 15:23:52 worship mao for the rest of the day
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:33:07 I could try
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:33:10 no promises though
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:34:38 wow not like that's the basic procedure!
general 2021-08-31 16:53:43 I was eating and playing guitar until now but I'll get to it now
general 2021-08-31 16:53:48 what's your preferred wheel size
general 2021-08-31 16:54:21 you should probably use full wheels
general 2021-08-31 16:54:30 half cylinders have shit hitboxes
general 2021-08-31 16:54:56 you sure?
general 2021-08-31 16:55:03 the warthog has pretty chonky wheels though
general 2021-08-31 16:56:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:01:02 sure
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:01:38 alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:16:54 sure
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:18:41 
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:18:44 smallest I could get it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:18:48 still trying to fix issues though
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:19:19 
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:19:20 as it should
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:20:24 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:20:31 just trying to fix it bouncing constantly
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:23:37 
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:23:49 not very space efficient but it's good for now
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:27:40 it keeps bouncing
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:29:58 I seem to have fixed the issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:30:19 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:33:20 it's just bouncing that's it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:33:29 no that's not the issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:36:14 fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:38:34 this is the absolute smallest I can make it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:38:35 with 2x2 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:38:59 6 I think
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:39:31 6 wide 10 long
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:40:21 that's the size
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:40:39 6 blocks wide and 10 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:41:22 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 17:43:43 ironically the compacted version has more blocks than the non compacted one
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:05:56 what does that mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:05:59 hold on let me play it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:06:09 shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:10:16 nope I have no idea what this is supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:10:44 oh you piece of shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:14:40 dude creeping death is so fun to play
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:15:42 especially the breakdown
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:16:07 you know the "Die, by my hand" part
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:16:11 where it slows down
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:21:27 breakdowns can be so powerful in a song
general 2021-08-31 18:31:46 how
general 2021-08-31 18:31:47 oh
general 2021-08-31 18:31:50 discord being the
general 2021-08-31 18:42:07 yeah it has pretty good songs
general 2021-08-31 18:42:23 2x4 and fuel are both pretty good songs
general 2021-08-31 18:51:30 just make an event
general 2021-08-31 18:52:27 read!!
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 18:55:34 the suspension is done but I have no will to build rn
general 2021-08-31 19:07:26 great conversation
general 2021-08-31 19:09:43 <@!195253906333368320> why are the bitrates of some vcs 128kbps
general 2021-08-31 19:10:10 hmm
general 2021-08-31 19:10:17 you mind if I drop those down to default then?
general 2021-08-31 19:10:28 128 sounds exactly like 64 but hinders those with bad connections
general 2021-08-31 19:10:30 right
general 2021-08-31 19:11:26 I honestly can't tell the difference
general 2021-08-31 19:11:37 I might just be going deaf
general 2021-08-31 19:11:39 to be honest
general 2021-08-31 19:12:09 damn
general 2021-08-31 19:12:53 I can't even imagine what it would be like
general 2021-08-31 19:13:06 I have good eyesight and hearing so I'm lucky on that part
general 2021-08-31 19:19:52 churchill avre

general 2021-09-02 21:39:55 never doing that again
general 2021-09-02 21:40:15 he said he was busy I think
general 2021-09-04 21:25:51 stop posting gore
general 2021-09-04 22:38:48 I was just about to go to bed
general 2021-09-04 22:39:08 goodbye
general 2021-09-05 14:54:56 was it not?
general 2021-09-05 14:55:06 damn
general 2021-09-05 14:55:12 the single was good though
general 2021-09-05 14:55:13 shame
general 2021-09-05 14:55:52 got a pretty good score on metacritic though
general 2021-09-05 14:56:38 yeah
general 2021-09-05 14:56:53 bruh the guardian rated it a 100
general 2021-09-05 14:56:54 wtf?
general 2021-09-05 14:57:05 the guardian is bad anyways
general 2021-09-05 14:57:19 unreliable news source and literally nothing to do with music
general 2021-09-05 14:57:43 I am very excited for it
general 2021-09-05 14:58:04 probably a lot of downtuned songs similar to dystopia to make it easier on dave's vocal chords
general 2021-09-05 14:58:10 he sounds pretty good though nowadays
general 2021-09-05 14:58:16 or atleast compared to what he sounded like
general 2021-09-05 14:59:00 not surprising considering the shit he's been through
general 2021-09-05 14:59:19 broken neck, throat cancer, surgery
general 2021-09-05 14:59:48 I agree
general 2021-09-05 14:59:56 even after having to relearn guitar he's great
general 2021-09-05 15:00:25 we were talking about iron maiden's new album then we shifted to something else
general 2021-09-05 15:00:40 yeah mfer literally learned guitar twice
general 2021-09-05 15:00:55 I agree
general 2021-09-05 15:01:36 I wish james and dave weren't going senile
general 2021-09-05 15:01:46 their early vocals sounded great and raw
general 2021-09-05 15:02:31 didn't he say "I wasn't singing, I was screaming in key" or something like that
general 2021-09-05 15:02:43 which is true but that's kind of the point of thrash
general 2021-09-05 15:03:27 still heavily fucking surprised at dave beating cancer though
general 2021-09-05 15:03:32 I was honestly convinced it would take him
general 2021-09-05 15:04:03 he's like almost 60, went through multiple addictions, had surgeries multiple times and he's still going
general 2021-09-05 15:04:45 no idea but really old
general 2021-09-05 15:04:57 holy shit he's 72
general 2021-09-05 15:04:58 wtf
general 2021-09-05 19:43:31 we don't pick favorites here

general 2021-09-10 12:37:57 ferraris are overrated and suck
general 2021-09-10 12:37:59 toyotas are superior
general 2021-09-10 12:39:03 got new guitar strings
general 2021-09-10 12:39:47 bass is a meme
general 2021-09-10 12:39:51 good bassists are cool
general 2021-09-10 12:40:16 but if you play bass just to be that one guy who constantly screams "SLAP" every 2 seconds you need to reconsider your life choices
general 2021-09-10 12:40:29 it's just strings but ok!
general 2021-09-10 12:40:54 piano sucks lol
general 2021-09-10 12:41:22 
general 2021-09-10 12:41:50 yeah exactly that's why piano sucks
general 2021-09-10 12:41:54 on it's own it's good
general 2021-09-10 12:42:00 but most parents force their kids to learn it
general 2021-09-10 12:42:40 no not really
general 2021-09-10 12:42:44 having bigger hands is an advantage
general 2021-09-10 12:43:59 they don't lol
general 2021-09-10 12:44:05 left handed guitars exist
general 2021-09-10 12:44:12 no it doesn't
general 2021-09-10 12:44:18 unless you're jimi hendrix
general 2021-09-10 12:44:27 that's why I don't play piano
general 2021-09-10 12:44:28 dumb
general 2021-09-10 12:45:43 okay let's see you do microtonal bends then
general 2021-09-10 12:46:14 and fact: guitarists look 900 times cooler than pianists on stage
general 2021-09-10 12:46:29 nano would beat me to it
general 2021-09-10 12:46:33 you would be gone
general 2021-09-10 12:46:35 in an instant
general 2021-09-10 12:47:41 wireless transmitters exist for guitars
general 2021-09-10 12:48:07 if you see a musician on stage without a guitar cable in their guitar it's because they have a wireless transmitter

creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:50:54 and the treads won't show up properly on images, will they?
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:51:02 therefore they do not matter
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:51:45 no treads would make it look dumb
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:51:52 fake treads is the best he can get
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:52:10 again, there's absolutely no way he can fit working treads and running gear in that thing
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:52:19 this is just nitpicking at this point

general 2021-10-14 19:49:40 <@!389756407483990028> currently money goes towards football and the PM's wellbeing instead of healthcare and education

general 2021-10-14 19:50:03 yeah
general 2021-10-14 19:50:22 approximately yes
general 2021-10-14 19:50:55 lmao don't forget the highest VAT tax in europe

general 2021-10-14 19:52:58 but yeah living conditions are subpar to say the least
general 2021-10-14 19:53:26 most people go to work in austria or just outside of hungary in general
general 2021-10-14 19:53:40 it's also common to buy cars and stuff from outside because no VAT
general 2021-10-14 19:53:55 that 27% really fucking hurts man
general 2021-10-14 19:53:58 yeah
general 2021-10-14 19:54:23 like I wanted to buy a guitar for 120k huf

general 2021-10-14 20:01:25 yeah pretty popular place to move
general 2021-10-14 20:01:49 lol not with hungarian
general 2021-10-14 20:02:06 closest relative is finnish and finnish is still chinese to us
general 2021-10-14 20:02:40 I could
general 2021-10-14 20:03:01 but in terms of grammatical rules and such I still have piss poor knowledge
general 2021-10-14 20:03:11 and it's very tough to lose the accent
general 2021-10-14 20:03:54 which part
general 2021-10-14 20:03:57 yeah english just sucks
general 2021-10-14 20:05:17 is gaelic still somewhat prominent in scotland?
general 2021-10-14 20:05:27 ah
general 2021-10-14 20:07:44 hungarian also makes a lot of sense but pronounciation is usually overcomplicated by english speakers
general 2021-10-14 20:08:18 bruh so that wikipedia page with the frog isn't fake??
general 2021-10-14 20:09:52 wait no nevermind
general 2021-10-14 20:10:17 I was referring to this
general 2021-10-14 20:11:45 apparently it's middle english
general 2021-10-14 20:12:03 I completely forgot about the thorn and the long S letters tbh
general 2021-10-14 20:16:24 wtf you're only now turning 14??
general 2021-10-14 20:16:38 deadass thought you were older than me
general 2021-10-14 20:16:41 üíÄ
general 2021-10-14 20:17:09 nah
general 2021-10-14 20:17:13 too much effort
general 2021-10-14 20:17:29 yeah but none of them are large enough
general 2021-10-14 20:18:51 year below freshman is 8th grade for us
general 2021-10-14 20:19:29 bro just like be independent already
general 2021-10-14 20:19:33 what are the british going to do
general 2021-10-14 20:19:37 piss themselves??
general 2021-10-14 20:20:03 damn ok
general 2021-10-14 20:20:31 also apparently if the "opposition" wins the next election then the euro will be introduced
general 2021-10-14 20:20:36 thank fuck
general 2021-10-14 20:21:50 y'all have uniforms?
general 2021-10-14 20:22:20 our school cannot afford to get rainproof ceilings nevermind a uniform üíÄ
general 2021-10-14 20:25:58 our roofs just break on their own
general 2021-10-14 20:26:16 there is genuinely a giant hole in my homeroom classroom roof
general 2021-10-14 20:26:28 one classroom is swimming in rainwater
general 2021-10-14 20:26:57 the changing room smells like sweat and is also swimming
general 2021-10-14 20:27:00 yes
general 2021-10-14 20:27:26 the showers are broken and there's also only 2
general 2021-10-14 20:27:43 the soap dispensers have coagulated soap
general 2021-10-14 20:27:53 (if you can find them)
general 2021-10-14 20:28:37 if the rooms were properly ventilated then that wouldn't be an issue
general 2021-10-14 20:28:59 also fun fact
general 2021-10-14 20:29:11 hungary is about 2000 teachers short
general 2021-10-14 20:29:28 I haven't had a programming class this semester
general 2021-10-14 20:29:32 I also have no maths teacher
general 2021-10-14 20:30:01 it sounds good on paper
general 2021-10-14 20:30:14 but I'm having a final at the end of this semester
general 2021-10-14 20:30:22 and there's no fucking way we're gonna be able to catch up
general 2021-10-14 20:31:10 reality is often disappointing
general 2021-10-14 20:31:19 although my grades so far are relatively consistent
general 2021-10-14 20:31:54 my english teacher is ukranian who speaks in broken english and is heavily leftist
general 2021-10-14 20:32:22 my communications teacher plays in one right now lol
general 2021-10-14 20:32:33 and is a drummer
general 2021-10-14 20:33:51 my school actually has a guitar
general 2021-10-14 20:34:04 but it's one of those shitty 100quid strats
general 2021-10-14 20:34:11 that's probably not even set up right
general 2021-10-14 20:36:18 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-10-14 20:36:23 yes
general 2021-10-14 20:46:35 I go eat rq ok bb
general 2021-10-14 21:03:06 lol short
general 2021-10-14 21:03:37 hi
general 2021-10-14 21:04:03 omg hi,,
general 2021-10-14 21:04:36 bottomgear is my first beb
general 2021-10-14 21:04:40 I have him on snap lol
general 2021-10-14 21:05:46 how are jeans embarassing
general 2021-10-14 21:05:55 y'all on that packwatch
general 2021-10-14 21:06:00 smoking a bozo pack
general 2021-10-14 21:06:03 jeans are swaggy
general 2021-10-14 21:06:18 clearly you buy the wrong type then
general 2021-10-14 21:06:39 bro I remember saying that in fucking 4th grade
general 2021-10-14 21:09:22 having a girlfriend is not that big of a deal
general 2021-10-14 21:09:35 if people don't want one then they're not obligated to do so
general 2021-10-14 21:10:16 and if people like you exist, rushing people to get girlfriends because "it's cool" then all that leads to is broken hearts, wasted time, and regret
general 2021-10-14 21:11:04 in fact, let me ask you
general 2021-10-14 21:11:09 have you had a girlfriend?
general 2021-10-14 21:11:28 it's very situational
general 2021-10-14 21:11:38 some people just don't have time or simply don't want one
general 2021-10-14 21:12:45 that's exactly why it doesn't matter if you have/had a girlfriend or not
general 2021-10-14 21:13:02 does it invalidate anyone's point? no not really
general 2021-10-14 21:13:10 therefore it's not relevant and you should stay silent
general 2021-10-14 21:14:47 <@!389756407483990028> just leave him
general 2021-10-14 21:14:48 lost cause

general 2021-10-14 21:25:33 fast power chord switch
general 2021-10-14 21:26:00 I just use it whereever I can now lol
general 2021-10-14 21:26:33 when I saw the video of dave teaching it I was like "OH SO that's how he plays wake up dead"
general 2021-10-14 21:26:40 I was tryna lightspeed my way through that shit
general 2021-10-14 21:29:28 I think it's quarter step down
general 2021-10-14 21:41:19 none
general 2021-10-14 21:42:39 I'm simply not the fighting type
general 2021-10-14 21:42:48 I'd rather get out of it diplomatically
general 2021-10-14 21:49:03 <@!791976765123592233> yo wanna see the explorer in it's glory?

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:38:04 also just saying if I catch you all minimodding again then I'll gladly make you all disappear quietly
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:38:39 unde checking is not the community's job
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:38:51 if there's someone you suspect, just call a mod
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:38:56 well clearly
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:39:26 you shouldn't ask for homework and shit, that's literally what I'm for
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:39:28 ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:39:54 wait further
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:40:10 with your barrage of questions you made the situation worse and now he's gone

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:45:33 yes

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:45:52 that's literally impossible
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:46:01 honesty comes with being harsh
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:46:28 then that's their problem
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:46:34 of not taking criticism at face value
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:47:14 that's just sugarcoating your words
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:47:33 people being hurt by words came from this exact mentality
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 13:47:56 they don't experience harshness regularly therefore they become sensitive

general 2022-03-27 15:51:14 it's dogshit
general 2022-03-27 15:51:32 4.7 with the m6a1 is so funny
general 2022-03-27 15:51:40 dumbass russians bounce on you very often
general 2022-03-27 15:55:39 barrel longer, larger explosive filler, more pen + velocity
general 2022-03-27 15:55:46 and also there's a stabilizer as well
general 2022-03-27 15:55:50 very amazing
general 2022-03-27 15:55:57 longer barrel = more velocity
general 2022-03-27 15:56:02 = more pen
general 2022-03-27 15:56:13 yeah
general 2022-03-27 15:56:26 the stuarts have them
general 2022-03-27 15:56:30 and the shermans
general 2022-03-27 15:56:46 you can still go for the cupola or mantlet center right side
general 2022-03-27 15:59:07 I mean the ammo is longer too for more explosive charge
general 2022-03-27 15:59:47 or propellant
general 2022-03-27 15:59:50 whatever it's called
general 2022-03-27 16:01:13 I mean
general 2022-03-27 16:01:16 more velocity usually

general 2022-04-05 17:05:33 fact
general 2022-04-06 17:24:05 he's right
general 2022-04-06 17:38:34 dresden
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:20:48 the entire thing is wack regarding proportions; the hull above the tracks is too tall and the entire thing is not long enough
also that's an m4a2 76 so the turret is wildly different as well
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:23:33 wtf is that front turret view, that's not even remotely close to a real one
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:25:21 replace the turret completely, add the missing roadwheel, add the suspension pieces, make it longer, and make the hull above the tracks less tall by like 0.5 blocks

zach the m4a2 shermans are all flat af on the front
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:28:03 missing the travel lock

because the wheels are too large, use sparklers
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:31:28 it is, the hull above the tracks is too tall
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:37:07 in zach's defense that sherman is below average in terms of accuracy (not build quality)
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:39:07 okay but you could still improve
creations-chat 2022-04-08 22:02:24 stop arguing about funny lego game you cavemen
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:36:41 it probably wasn't much better
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:36:54 also depends what the build was
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:37:05 you get bonus points if it's unique and not military vehicle #2454576898
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:37:43 I really don't see what the fuck you're complaining about
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:37:51 if you think the build is bad, then submit yours to hof
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:38:02 either way, keep it to yourself
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:38:11 because frankly the crab is good enough to be there
creations-chat 2022-04-12 21:39:08 it did exist, his point for coping just doesn't make sense
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:39:20 "oh lol I build better than that"
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:39:22 ok prove it
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:40:58 y'all mfs jumping on any opportunity to present your god complex and be competitive in block game
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:41:04 pipe down and get good

bot-central 2022-04-12 21:41:41 ?whois 558094176340803586
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:42:34 you made an outrageous claim that your build quality is higher than that of a build which got into hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:42:42 yet you have no evidence or proof to prove it
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:42:54 and now you claim that it was a troll
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:43:04 that's not a troll, that's being petty and pathetic
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:43:16 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:43:19 nobody cares
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:44:06 and if you didn't record the whole process of building it on mobile, it could be easily debunked by just assuming that you built it on pc and screenshotted on mobile to seem good
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:45:11 this new generation of pcc members are completely braindead holy shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:45:15 how did it fall so low
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:47:08 no not really
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:47:14 I don't think differently of the build
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:47:22 because I don't care if you built it on mobile or not
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:47:28 if it's shit then it's shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-12 21:51:57

general 2022-04-20 14:34:11 if you zoom in then you can see how lazy the build actually is
general 2022-04-20 14:34:15 no real shape or anything
general 2022-04-20 14:34:21 it's a flying fridge with an interior

general 2022-04-20 14:36:24 zach is leading though so thankfully something good looking will win
general 2022-04-20 14:36:56 why not
general 2022-04-20 14:36:58 the build is good
general 2022-04-20 14:37:06 wouldn't be justified to not let him win
general 2022-04-20 14:37:11 I have
general 2022-04-20 14:37:19 I have known him for years at this point
general 2022-04-20 14:37:26 and y'all take him way too fucking seriously lmao

general 2022-04-20 14:38:06 and atleast that took actual effort lmao
general 2022-04-20 14:38:28 no he was the OG hars
general 2022-04-20 14:38:43 even then hars was a driving factor for not letting people have skill issues
general 2022-04-20 14:38:55 if you get criticized, stop crying about it
general 2022-04-20 14:38:58 go improve instead
general 2022-04-20 14:40:10 idk why y'all hate zach so much lmfao
general 2022-04-20 14:40:20 I'm astonished why this community still takes anything seriously
general 2022-04-20 14:41:02 it's not even hof drama
general 2022-04-20 14:41:05 it's contest drama

creations-chat 2022-05-03 18:52:23 I posted 3 times, only 2 of which were the same and even then I added enough onto it to make me go "okay I post again"
the one I just posted is barely similar to the earlier one, and the only thing I kept was the cab and a portion of the steering system
creations-chat 2022-05-03 18:55:57 you made a shitty mug pixelart and an even worse school bus, I would've taken your advice if you had kept your mouth shut and not started with an insult right off the bat
and it's a fucking tractor dude I could care less about upvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-03 19:00:13 I literally do not care, I was memeing with fleet and then you came in out of nowhere trying to be cool and righteous lol
omg saplingseedsac2 is typing...
creations-chat 2022-05-03 19:04:08 what the fuck are you on about, what about "@ FleetOfRetribution die" is not blatant sarcasm you monkey
I never said tractors can't get criticism, I was joking that "omg jet builder has no taste"; I think both me and fleet got the joke and yet it flew over your ass
we wouldn't be having this convo if you hadn't butted into our friendly discussion

plane-crazy 2022-05-16 17:28:20 the cutter, wedge 1x2, and half wedges are angled at 60 something degrees
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 17:28:34 if it were on it's side then it wouldn't match

general 2022-05-19 16:44:54 you're literally part of the herd
general 2022-05-19 16:44:57 you don't lead it
general 2022-05-19 16:47:00 you're still not funny lol
general 2022-05-19 16:47:06 and I'm not being sarcastic
general 2022-05-19 16:47:10 I literally find you annoying
general 2022-05-19 16:47:24 I'm not a mod anymore so I can let out some steam
general 2022-05-19 16:47:40 no you literally have just never been funny
general 2022-05-19 16:47:53 you are part of a group of people who claim to be regulars but in reality nobody likes you
general 2022-05-19 16:47:58 that is the truth and always has been
general 2022-05-19 16:50:15 I would probably bottle my opinions up like I did before
general 2022-05-19 16:50:19 now I'm not constrained
general 2022-05-19 16:52:49 russia, italy, france, america
general 2022-05-19 16:52:54 those all get good SPAA
general 2022-05-19 16:53:18 yeah so does italy
general 2022-05-19 16:53:29 but the .50s are more than capable
general 2022-05-19 16:53:37 what the fuck do you mean
general 2022-05-19 16:53:49 italy faces germany all the same lol
general 2022-05-19 16:53:56 my condolences
general 2022-05-19 16:54:05 but unfortunately you need to get better aim
general 2022-05-19 16:54:22 get a feel for the guns and practice in your spare time
general 2022-05-19 18:06:18 8 of the same shit guns is not good lol
general 2022-05-19 18:06:44 early spitfires are amazing except for the actually fucking awful guns
general 2022-05-19 18:06:58 with 7.7s you're not going to get ANY fires
general 2022-05-19 18:07:03 you have to rely on pure physical damage
general 2022-05-19 18:07:06 so go for tracers
general 2022-05-19 18:07:24 you can but it's once in a millenia
general 2022-05-19 18:07:33 it's not worth going for fires
general 2022-05-19 18:07:40 just shred the enemy's wing or pilot snipe them
general 2022-05-19 18:07:43 you'll have more success
general 2022-05-19 18:08:25 the british 7.7s are awful
general 2022-05-19 18:08:35 like you could do more damage with a slingshot from the cockpit standing up
general 2022-05-19 18:08:58 japanese guns are not that bad .50 and up

general 2022-05-19 18:09:51 point is the japanese .50s and 20mms are really good
general 2022-05-19 18:10:15 then learn to aim
general 2022-05-19 18:10:42 then you're getting bad hits
general 2022-05-19 18:11:05 you're either shooting for all of the wrong places or you just don't know how low velocity they are

general 2022-05-29 09:40:58 and they look DUMB
general 2022-05-29 10:08:55 absolute fucking waste of rp
general 2022-05-29 10:09:33 ok
general 2022-05-29 10:09:41 it's absolute asscheeks and it looks horrendous
general 2022-05-29 10:12:14 functioning suspension or piston lock on sprocket/idler
general 2022-05-29 10:12:38 fym?
general 2022-05-29 10:12:42 you've built tank suspension
general 2022-05-29 10:12:50 ok well that's an exaggeration
general 2022-05-29 10:13:00 you mongrel
general 2022-05-29 10:13:18 put pistons that lock and extend the idler/sprocket wheels
general 2022-05-29 10:13:54 that also works if they're too tight
general 2022-05-29 10:14:04 no do not do this
general 2022-05-29 10:14:09 this is a horrible way
general 2022-05-29 10:14:22 you'll end up with uneven track links and you'll bounce
general 2022-05-29 10:15:17 chicken butt
general 2022-05-29 10:15:27 at this point everyone has converted to that method
general 2022-05-29 10:15:33 not really saying much
general 2022-05-29 10:15:42 making tracks is trial and error already

general 2022-06-03 19:39:43 that's dumb
general 2022-06-03 19:40:04 it doesn't matter what it's supposed to represent ingame, if it has a bunch of turrets slapped on then it's a turret plane
general 2022-06-03 19:40:42 Mrloldudeepik is the stupidest name for a user I've ever heard

general 2022-06-03 20:37:13 yes I know
general 2022-06-03 20:37:27 and the hesh on jpz is really bad
general 2022-06-03 20:37:32 hesh in general is unreliable
general 2022-06-03 20:38:12 either way the asu is still better than the jpz

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:52:26 there was a guy who asked me for help with tank suspension like a year ago
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:52:34 man copied my suspension and claimed it as his

plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:11:06 (the goblins are coming)
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:14:50 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:15:12 thin tracks are painful to make, maintain and tension
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:15:29 and it's gonna be twice the block count of regular tracks
general 2022-06-11 15:30:25 wyvern is borderline overpowered except for turning
general 2022-06-11 15:30:34 air too
general 2022-06-11 15:30:44 it's super fucking fast with great guns
general 2022-06-11 15:31:02 yeah but it's an xp50
general 2022-06-11 15:31:53 the hispanos are about as good as german ones now
general 2022-06-11 15:33:20 f14 will literally not even be that good
general 2022-06-11 15:33:24 it's the A variant
general 2022-06-11 15:33:46 way better how
general 2022-06-11 15:34:20 it's on par with 11.3s
general 2022-06-11 15:34:32 that doesn't mean it's overpowered
general 2022-06-11 15:34:35 that's just how uptiers are
general 2022-06-11 15:42:50 truth
general 2022-06-11 15:42:54 it will be really funny

general 2022-06-11 15:49:14 hello senmodeluxembourg

general 2022-06-11 15:51:10 looks like interwar
general 2022-06-11 15:51:48 I read somewhere that max speed was around 400-500
general 2022-06-11 15:52:00 so I don't think it would've been very good
general 2022-06-11 15:52:22 the hungarians made a really similar design though that could've competed with strike aircraft in the european theatre <:TROL:856015674240925708>
general 2022-06-11 15:52:35 
general 2022-06-11 15:53:58 yeah

general 2022-06-11 15:54:08 with similar if not lighter construction
general 2022-06-11 15:54:50 yes
general 2022-06-11 15:55:14 I don't know if this is a mockup or a flying prototype but it does exist
general 2022-06-11 15:55:32 probably wouldn't turn well
general 2022-06-11 15:55:39 wings don't look like they give too much lift
general 2022-06-11 15:56:01 
general 2022-06-11 15:57:18 paper reads "Varga L: RMI 8. (X/V); 2x 1450(hp) DB605; V max = 800km/h"
general 2022-06-11 15:58:49 we also made a bunch of prototype aircraft
general 2022-06-11 15:58:59 and the first turbopropeller engine ever
general 2022-06-11 15:59:11 this is a trainer made in 1943
general 2022-06-11 16:00:01 and this big bomber airliner thing
general 2022-06-11 16:00:35 I mean it was common to make airliners into bombers early war
general 2022-06-11 16:00:53 ju-86, fw-200, a bunch of italian stuff
general 2022-06-11 16:01:05 
general 2022-06-11 16:01:58 then there's this ugly thing
general 2022-06-11 16:03:35 this would've replaced the 210
general 2022-06-11 16:03:39 funny turboprop engine

general 2022-06-13 17:15:16 panther 2 never existed
general 2022-06-13 17:15:29 the panther 2 is purely fictional although plausible
general 2022-06-13 17:15:48 the nightvision on it existed, the turret existed, the gun existed
general 2022-06-13 17:16:17 NO WAY
general 2022-06-13 17:16:56 "...did not progress beyond prototypes and did not enter production."

general 2022-06-15 19:22:55 they don't monitor chat 24/7
general 2022-06-15 19:23:34 and considering the amount of snitches in chat the chance of a slur going past a mod is super low
general 2022-06-15 19:24:51 none of the mods I worked with were blatantly homophobic enough to let slurs pass

general 2022-06-15 19:27:39 go and be productive
general 2022-06-15 19:28:15 the mods warn for both
general 2022-06-15 19:28:20 I don't see your point
general 2022-06-15 19:28:39 only difference is suggestive warns don't stay

general 2022-06-20 17:11:35 rick has university and shit
general 2022-06-20 17:11:41 he got better priorities than fucking pc
general 2022-06-20 17:11:55 softcoding ain't easy bruh
general 2022-06-20 17:12:54 I don't develop but I do learn coding
general 2022-06-20 17:12:59 do you??
general 2022-06-20 17:13:10 python
general 2022-06-20 17:13:20 and mf it's an entire game
general 2022-06-20 17:13:40 shut yo goofy googly eyed headass up
general 2022-06-20 17:13:57 if it's so easy to softcode pc then go do it yourself
general 2022-06-20 17:13:58 bitchass
general 2022-06-20 17:14:29 yeah well you sound like you got bullied in school
general 2022-06-20 17:14:35 all talk no balls
general 2022-06-20 17:14:55 kid named dogs:
general 2022-06-20 17:15:00 yeah what about it
general 2022-06-20 17:15:20 speak english
general 2022-06-20 17:15:28 none of what you just said was coherent
general 2022-06-20 17:15:57 you're going off topic because you cannot prove that it's easy to softcode
general 2022-06-20 17:16:11 I speak 2 and one of them is easily the hardest language in europe
general 2022-06-20 17:16:31 yeah well your input is worthless to this conversation
general 2022-06-20 17:16:34 prove that it's easy to softcode
general 2022-06-20 17:16:36 grow some balls
general 2022-06-20 17:17:00 disrespectful for telling you to prove your statement?
general 2022-06-20 17:17:11 your logic is flawed
general 2022-06-20 17:17:44 I've literally been telling you to prove what you claim
general 2022-06-20 17:17:52 like 3 times already
general 2022-06-20 17:18:04 you have the attention span and iq of a fish
general 2022-06-20 17:18:14 to prove that it's easy to softcode???
general 2022-06-20 17:18:17 where the fuck are you bruh
general 2022-06-20 17:18:26 literally talking with a wall right now
general 2022-06-20 17:18:35 that's hardcoded
general 2022-06-20 17:18:52 do you learn to code at all
general 2022-06-20 17:18:58 do you even know what softcoding is
general 2022-06-20 17:19:07 ok then what are you on about
general 2022-06-20 17:19:14 stop making statements that you cannot prove
general 2022-06-20 17:19:27 just because you're impatient for a game to be coded again
general 2022-06-20 17:19:36 you have no idea what you're talking about
general 2022-06-20 17:19:50 you claim that softcoding is easy
general 2022-06-20 17:19:59 indirectly saying that rickje should hurry up
general 2022-06-20 17:20:08 ????
general 2022-06-20 17:20:12 feelings hurt?
general 2022-06-20 17:20:13 cool then leave
general 2022-06-20 17:20:24 ok then what do you mean
general 2022-06-20 17:20:28 state your claim again
general 2022-06-20 17:21:17 game release times change
general 2022-06-20 17:21:26 and with rickje being the only developer (that we know of)
general 2022-06-20 17:21:31 that is absolutely bound to happen
general 2022-06-20 17:21:50 would you rather get an unfinished pc2 now or a finished and fully working pc2 later
general 2022-06-20 17:22:16 that was almost a year ago
general 2022-06-20 17:22:20 outdated information
general 2022-06-20 17:22:43 I saw sneak peeks but I'm not going to say anything
general 2022-06-20 17:23:13 it's the start of summer
general 2022-06-20 17:23:16 we're back literally where we started
general 2022-06-20 17:23:30 it's only the 20th of june with atleast 2 months remaining
general 2022-06-20 17:24:14 well I clearly know more than you considering I was a mod for a year
general 2022-06-20 17:24:29 and literally what's wrong with swearing
general 2022-06-20 17:24:33 not a big flex
general 2022-06-20 17:24:35 it's a statement
general 2022-06-20 17:24:51 and unless you're part of the dev team you have no grounds to talk
general 2022-06-20 17:24:58 oh yeah you tell me bruh
general 2022-06-20 17:25:51 everytime you go online during european hours you're the #1 target for underage people asking to be verified
general 2022-06-20 17:26:10 mods get more information about development than the average member
general 2022-06-20 17:26:19 no because that's literally what you sign up for
general 2022-06-20 17:26:41 I'm not disclosing it because it's not meant to be disclosed
general 2022-06-20 17:26:54 it's only given to mods for a reason
general 2022-06-20 17:26:58 not for me to spread it all around pcc
general 2022-06-20 17:27:45 being a mod here is literally not that hard
general 2022-06-20 17:27:52 just check for pings and write commands
general 2022-06-20 17:27:57 and occasionally help people verify
general 2022-06-20 17:27:58 that's it
general 2022-06-20 17:28:43 don't even try conversing with him, literally talking to a brick wall
general 2022-06-20 17:31:28 easiest and still confusing
general 2022-06-20 17:31:49 yeah I know
general 2022-06-20 17:31:58 gotta watch out for order of things and other shit
general 2022-06-20 17:32:54 IDLE?
general 2022-06-20 17:33:02 what's that stand for
general 2022-06-20 17:33:12 I use VSCode so idk what that means
general 2022-06-20 17:33:22 that's how I troubleshoot
general 2022-06-20 17:33:31 bye tongdee üëã

general 2022-10-20 22:12:44 plane crazy is fine for a roblox based game tho
general 2022-10-20 22:13:14 not just that
general 2022-10-20 22:13:28 but other hardcoded lines that were built up over the years

general 2022-10-20 22:22:40 more important things
general 2022-10-20 22:23:00 plus he doesn't get paid much from PC because roblox refuses to give him ownership of the game
general 2022-10-20 22:23:16 he gets like

general 2022-10-23 18:30:56 2. not enough to recover after purchase
general 2022-10-23 18:36:54 this will severely impact my balance
general 2022-10-23 18:48:27 rest in piss
general 2022-10-23 18:52:47 this hangar looks so fresh
general 2022-10-23 18:53:06 custom hangar
general 2022-10-23 18:53:40 I will try to find
general 2022-10-23 18:54:08 https://live.warthunder.com/post/970780/en/
general 2022-10-23 18:54:23 jet gameplay isn't about turning
general 2022-10-23 18:54:29 it's not like props
general 2022-10-23 18:54:34 whole different style of gameplay
general 2022-10-23 18:54:53 jet gameplay is about energy fighting not turnfighting
general 2022-10-23 18:55:04 no but I've played jets and it's not at all like props
general 2022-10-23 18:55:10 useless turning leads to your doom
general 2022-10-23 18:55:28 no??
general 2022-10-23 18:55:32 shit take sorry man
general 2022-10-23 18:55:50 make that 7.7
general 2022-10-23 18:55:55 name the early turnfighting jets
general 2022-10-23 18:56:00 like the mig9 and the yak
general 2022-10-23 18:56:03 they are all
general 2022-10-23 18:56:05 fucking terrible
general 2022-10-23 18:56:19 because they're not focused for keeping or pulling energy out of their ass
general 2022-10-23 18:56:26 they're focused for mindless turning
general 2022-10-23 18:56:53 yes but not nearly as much as with props
general 2022-10-23 18:57:06 also wym harrier and jaguar and f104 aren't ass because they can't turn
general 2022-10-23 18:57:19 they're ass because they don't fit the meta
general 2022-10-23 18:57:24 quite false
general 2022-10-23 18:57:44 the f104 for example has far worse problems than the inability to turn
general 2022-10-23 18:58:58 it sucks but not because it cannot turn
general 2022-10-23 18:59:06 f104asa: only 4 9ls at 11.3 (2 aspides but no gun and who tf even uses aspides), faces tomcats regularly
general 2022-10-23 18:59:21 if you use a jet in the purpose it's not built for then of course it's gonna suck you idiot
general 2022-10-23 18:59:31 literally broken
general 2022-10-23 18:59:42 that's just stock syndrome??
general 2022-10-23 18:59:47 not the plane's fault
general 2022-10-23 19:00:03 it's because it fights planes with missiles
general 2022-10-23 19:00:05 you are stupid
general 2022-10-23 19:00:06 xu
general 2022-10-23 19:00:21 ok and who's better at the game
general 2022-10-23 19:00:22 me or you
general 2022-10-23 19:00:23 waiting
general 2022-10-23 19:00:41 bro why the fuck would you turn in a jet
general 2022-10-23 19:01:04 why are you surprised that you die in a plane that's supposed to boom and zoom
general 2022-10-23 19:01:08 when you try to dogfight
general 2022-10-23 19:01:10 are you mad
general 2022-10-23 19:01:25 and about the missile argument
general 2022-10-23 19:01:39 how do you die when you don't have missiles yet
general 2022-10-23 19:01:43 I guarantee it's from a missile
general 2022-10-23 19:01:59 because you quite literally brought a laser pointer to a rocket launcher fight
general 2022-10-23 19:02:09 it's because you cannot dodge
general 2022-10-23 19:02:15 you either have no idea how to notch
general 2022-10-23 19:02:19 or have no idea how to dodge
general 2022-10-23 19:02:36 plot twist it's not immediately when the missile is 2.3 km away
general 2022-10-23 19:03:00 dogfighting gameplay isn't a thing from like 8,3 onwards bro
general 2022-10-23 19:03:21 with that logic
general 2022-10-23 19:03:36 you should always constantly go for a headon and fully commit because it has a chance to do something to your enemy
general 2022-10-23 19:04:07 if you don't position or if you get yourself into shitty position then don't be surprised that you die
general 2022-10-23 19:05:35 you'll quickly go away from that mentality if you ever play a minor nation jet
general 2022-10-23 19:05:42 due to repair cost
general 2022-10-23 19:05:54 wow sorry I like to have fun
general 2022-10-23 19:06:10 it's not a bad plane
general 2022-10-23 19:06:13 it's in a bad position
general 2022-10-23 19:06:26 no
general 2022-10-23 19:06:38 it literally is not a bad plane
general 2022-10-23 19:06:42 f14 spam makes it a bad plane
general 2022-10-23 19:06:55 4x phoenixes coming straight at you is not a plane issue
general 2022-10-23 19:06:59 it's a balance issue
general 2022-10-23 19:07:14 br = balance
general 2022-10-23 19:07:53 or just remove full uptiers in it's entirety
general 2022-10-23 19:08:07 you shouldn't be able to face something a whole ass br higher
general 2022-10-23 19:08:21 fr
general 2022-10-23 19:08:38 I get that it's supposed to help queue times
general 2022-10-23 19:08:46 but it's such a frustrating and shitty mechanic
general 2022-10-23 19:10:08 also <@652925710976942100> you asked how to get a custom hangar right
