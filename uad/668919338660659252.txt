The Tale of doggyinfinty (668919338660659252)
general 2022-04-03 01:21:58 Hey guys
general 2022-04-03 01:22:15 I did!
general 2022-04-03 01:23:00 I read the rules
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:25:28 One time I did a project to build a small plane that could fly a couple of meters using 3 materials
i got a 100% on it
For some reason in plane crazy I’m awful at building planes, I think there’s a problem with my iq
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:26:20 when someone said “I use roll” I said “what is roll”
I’m so stupid for not remembering what roll was
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:26:55 for planes I mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:27:29 i did make a huge plane though that could fly though.
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:27:43 I hate making big planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:27:55 took me like an hour to make it
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:28:33 why is the rotation in plane crazy so confusing
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:29:06 Why do I have to make 2 pair of wings JUST TO BALANCE THE PLANE
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:29:15 Why can’t it be unrealistic
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:29:47 making the rudder is fine though
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:29:58 oh my god I hate triangle block wedges
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:30:48 Who hates having to build with triangle block wedges
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:31:55 Hehehee hey guys
you know the cockpit of a plane?
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:32:28 EHEHEHEHEEHHHEHEHHEEHHEHEHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:33:50 mm speaking of why can’t planes in plane crazy be more realistic
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:34:37 true that
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:34:46 i put rockets inside my plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 01:34:59 rocket engines

general 2022-04-03 13:43:35 Do you know what a server partner is
general 2022-04-03 13:44:05 https://discord.com/partners
general 2022-04-03 13:44:51 Oh my god you’re missing my point, nevermind
general 2022-04-03 13:45:36 I said “you’re missing my point” and you said the same thing BRUH
general 2022-04-03 13:46:19 Because that’s not my point, I never said plane crazy needed to be partnered with discord
general 2022-04-03 13:47:04 “Why can’t you answer questions”
bruh hypocrite
general 2022-04-03 13:48:01 To answer your question
the reason would be
server discovery
more perks for the server members
general 2022-04-03 13:48:56 I never intended to answer that type of question, jeez
general 2022-04-03 13:49:14 THIS should’ve answered your question
general 2022-04-03 13:50:03 Clearly you don’t :/
general 2022-04-03 16:06:48 Physics is a social construct made by the wright brothers
why the hell do I need WINGS to fly a plane
general 2022-04-03 16:07:17 I want physics gone
general 2022-04-03 16:07:28 It shouldn’t exist
general 2022-04-03 16:07:36 WHAT THE HELL DOES “YAW” MEAN
general 2022-04-03 16:07:39 TO YAWN?
general 2022-04-03 16:08:09 Man nobody cares in my rant about physics
general 2022-04-03 16:08:34 Can’t believe that everything falls
general 2022-04-03 16:38:24 Honestly not surprising
general 2022-04-03 16:38:39 All teenagers go through a “moody” phase I think
general 2022-04-03 16:40:46 he does have a sport pfp so that also makes sense
Coaches are tough on people because there’s no such thing as fun in soccer
