creations-chat 2021-02-15 17:32:28 tank with suspension
creations-chat 2021-02-15 17:36:11 it can shedd its skin too so you see the actual suspension
creations-chat 2021-02-15 17:39:49 didnt say it was tank suspension but it works as it. Also the actual tank part isnt finnished yet i have only made like half of the bottom
creations-chat 2021-02-15 17:45:45 i know its too short and that it doesnt have enough wheels but that is because the only way to fix it is to redesign the whole thing since there isnt any copy paste tool and stuff like that so i need to delete the whole wheel part and the tracks +some of the suspension one time on eache side. But its atleast better then the first prototype lol
creations-chat 2021-02-15 17:49:08 LMAO
