creations-chat 2020-01-02 08:53:54 my roadroller and Sw1ftpr0AnimZ' za warudo
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:15:34 Ok, so from my observations, if anyone posts their creation they worked hard on, it'll get downvoted to hell, unless it's a fucking airliner
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:16:42 Or a fucking battleship
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:17:06 Even though it's like the same three, generic, Yamato, and Nimitz
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:17:40 Or if it's an Airbus A380, or a warthog, or a generic American fighter jet
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:18:18 ***from my observations***
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:20:10 And I don't really agree with you about things getting downvoted just for being blocky
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:22:09 Yeah, like, if it's a ridiculously huge build, that makes sense
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:22:38 But it seems to me that "badass" is just a few fighter jets, airliners and battleships
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:35:34 Sure, I can't post it in this channel coz yeah
general 2020-01-06 12:45:58

general 2020-01-06 12:46:21 See what I mean??
general 2020-01-06 12:46:32 Like why does everyone hate these
general 2020-01-06 12:46:52 Leon, if you would care to check <#504436696021204992> then you would understand
general 2020-01-06 12:47:24 I literally dont see how
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:47:37 Done
general 2020-01-06 12:47:50 Oh for fuck sake
general 2020-01-06 12:47:59 I HAVE SEEN GOOD BUILDS
general 2020-01-06 12:48:18 what makes you a fucking art critique?
general 2020-01-06 12:48:23 Yes, I can
general 2020-01-06 12:48:42 I'm saying, it doesn't deserve that much hate
general 2020-01-06 12:49:57 Now listen up, what I've seen is that you all just looooove your battleships, passenger planes, and how could I forget US fighter jets
general 2020-01-06 12:50:17 But when anything else is built, oh noooo it's so uuuglyyy
general 2020-01-06 12:50:25 It's not mine
general 2020-01-06 12:50:56 Regardless of what they call it, is it a good functioning build?
general 2020-01-06 12:51:07 FFS I'm not crying
general 2020-01-06 12:51:28 You all just jump into a conversation you had nothing to do with
general 2020-01-06 12:52:02 Jesus Christ, are you really that fucking stupid
general 2020-01-06 12:53:01 I have stated that I am only curious as to why people really dislike them and think it's a bad look?
general 2020-01-06 12:53:26 For god sake you can't compare it to THAT
general 2020-01-06 12:53:49 That, I can agree is an eyesore
general 2020-01-06 12:54:29 Listen
general 2020-01-06 12:54:45 Everyone shut the fuck up and let me say what I'm Tryna say
general 2020-01-06 12:55:20 Listen, the hall of fame are like ridiculously good, of course these aren't as good! But does that make them shit??
general 2020-01-06 12:55:36 ...bruh
general 2020-01-06 12:56:01 So, if anyone makes a build that isn't as good as the hall of fame ones, then it's shit
general 2020-01-06 12:57:06 OI LISTEN UP BITCH
general 2020-01-06 12:57:27 Now, the reason why is because the reactions didn't show up any further

plane-crazy 2020-01-06 13:04:01 Back to the topic, now, if you all weren't so cancerous, and I know that's a big hypocritical moment here, but all would've been fine if you had you know, been not as aggressive towards me in the First place, causing me to snap
general 2020-01-06 13:05:41 Back to the topic, now, if you all weren't so cancerous, and I know that's a big hypocritical moment here, but all would've been fine if you had you know, been not as aggressive towards me in the First place, causing me to snap
general 2020-01-06 13:09:07 And weren't mocking me for making a statement, then all would be ok

general 2020-01-06 13:14:15 Ok! That's your opinion! I wanted to know WHY
general 2020-01-06 13:14:44 Yes, I know
general 2020-01-06 13:15:20 But why should we have high standards? If they're so high then it's gonna inevitablely cause the games downfall
general 2020-01-06 13:15:40 You should be able to see past a standard

bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:13:18 Not sure what to do, but my good friend MrGloopy has had a ***COLLOSAL*** issue with the game. For some reason, when they joined the game, the game would spawn him in the middle of the map and wouldn't let him load anything, not even a plot was assigned to him. This continued for days, and wouldn't work no matter what, ***BUT NOW*** it's apparently fine, seeing as this is an issue that has existed, I have decided to report it to bring it to awareness in case anyone else is affected by it and isn't as lucky for it to work again
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:15:06 Edit: sorry <@646380050907791411> for posting after you like that, ***if this is seen, make sure to notice his complaint aswell please***
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:16:45 <@415036739653074944> with all due respect, I wouldn't bet on your knowledge, because you don't have a part in the programming of the game so you can't be certain that it IS fixed
bug-reports 2020-01-06 14:16:52 Even if you've been told
