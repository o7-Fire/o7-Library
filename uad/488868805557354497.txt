bug-reports 2020-09-08 21:12:13 ive had to use cutter bugs to stop them from continuing
creations-chat 2020-09-08 23:38:00 it took 2-4 hours of building and testing.
creations-chat 2020-09-08 23:44:47 how come one low-effort build gets more upvotes than downvotes when my tank gets a lot of downvotes and little upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-09 00:00:28 who would win: terrestrial overlord aka nx-1024 or a mech
creations-chat 2020-09-09 00:01:09 me?

creations-chat 2020-09-09 16:32:41 rank*
bot-central 2020-09-09 17:39:19 ,suggest A railgun pvp weapon that is heavy. Only 1-3 of this would be placeable, and it would be a 1x2 block. When it fires, a rail would fire out of it, and come out at high speeds. It would be heavy because of the rail. That's right, you cant add it to you car with weapon spam because you will tip over. 

Note: If it's ever added, please don't make it a ugly model like the gun, try making it a detailed one like the missile.
bot-central 2020-09-09 17:39:36 how do i suggest
bot-central 2020-09-09 17:39:51 ?shelp
creations-chat 2020-09-09 18:13:00 still dunno how to make this better....
creations-chat 2020-09-09 18:13:33 btw just incase any lower effort tanks go under me i made it a spikey hell
creations-chat 2020-09-09 18:32:50 LOL
creations-chat 2020-09-09 20:11:44 i might remodel my spike railgun or create a railgun that only uses guns since my rail pvp weapon hasnt been approved or considered yet
creations-chat 2020-09-09 21:04:50 i suggested that shredderbugs are a bannable offense ingame, so if anyone cares go vote
general 2020-09-09 21:05:06 i suggested that shredderbugs should be a bannable offense ingame, so if anyone cares go vote
creations-chat 2020-09-09 21:16:10 my only solution to the shredderbugs is use them against themselves, what i mean is shredderbug vs shredderbug
creations-chat 2020-09-09 21:16:21 if this suggestion passes ill delete the counters
creations-chat 2020-09-09 21:21:18 i have a launchable shredderbug on a 2nd variant of my bad destroyer incase a shredder comes at me

creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:32:33 should i add a fighter bay filled with tutorial planes with 1 gun?
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:34:35 also if i do make it i might have to redo the tutorial since ive basically forgotten how to build it
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:36:07 what should i fill it with if i do make it
creations-chat 2020-09-09 22:37:06 tutorial planes are my best option for fighters since i dont really have anything small enough to fit in there

plane-crazy 2021-07-20 14:01:39 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 14:03:09 what the fuck is it supposed to be then to you
creations-chat 2021-07-21 18:53:30 why do people still keep fucking trying to get upvotes in creations with among us builds when all of those among us creations get downvoted to hell
creations-chat 2021-07-23 02:36:54 that looks like a freakin missle, is it a submarine? or an actual missle? or some sort of torpedo thing? i don't know what it is
creations-chat 2021-07-23 19:18:27 <@456226577798135808> THE CHANNEL DESCRIPTION AT THE TOP OF THE AREA WHERE YOU CAN SEE MESSAGES CLEARLY SAYS TO NOT POST REFERENCE IMAGES
creations-chat 2021-07-30 16:51:19 imagine if there was a tank that looked normal until it suddenly unlocks it's motors to reveal like 75 freaking missiles
creations-chat 2021-07-31 15:28:53 fun fact: if you add a fuck ton of rockets to your tanks you can make it outrun shredder bugs because it will be a SUPERSONIC tank
creations-chat 2021-07-31 15:33:25 most shredder bugs that join the pvp server im in when they realize i have builds with supersonic rockets, antishredders that are OP, things that can dominate entire servers: run.
help 2021-07-31 15:36:34 use the weak durablility to your advantage untill someone invents some sort of durable shredder bugs
help 2021-07-31 15:37:05 1 well placed rocket can send most shredders to the ground
help 2021-07-31 15:37:33 oh
help 2021-07-31 15:37:40 i just use shredder vs shredder
help 2021-07-31 15:37:44 in that case
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 15:42:10 How to use most shredders' weak durability to your advantage: 
Have something fast that has a rocket, then aim it towards the shredder, Then, launch all your rockets and watch them go at supersonic speeds and annihalate it. (This is for most shredders, not all)

creations-chat 2021-08-12 20:12:34 i made this motor lock so that  the motorlock base both is on the half blocks AND is in the middle of the 2x2 square. probably could be done on 4x4 square
creations-chat 2021-08-12 20:14:46 this is what the motorlock looks like when launched
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:55:11 tiniest missle probably ever made, it's hard to control but still able to be controlled
creations-chat 2021-08-19 15:00:15 i ment like missles built with blocks, not the actual missle block

so is mine one of the smallest?
creations-chat 2021-08-19 15:02:28 to fit it into the small space......
general 2022-11-16 21:44:22 what does the legacy option do for the rocket weapon
general 2022-11-16 21:45:16 oh
