general 2022-09-05 07:19:53 commit no life until you have over 600 hours ingame
general 2022-09-05 07:20:50 I got a suggestion for ya
general 2022-09-05 07:20:55 try to build something that you want
general 2022-09-05 07:20:59 and when something doesn't work
general 2022-09-05 07:21:00 ask here
general 2022-09-05 07:21:08 that seems pretty reasonable I think
general 2022-09-05 07:22:30 oh also
general 2022-09-05 07:22:35 tip no.2
general 2022-09-05 07:22:43 have something to base your build off of
general 2022-09-05 07:22:59 dont just let ur brain decide what u want and have like an image from pinterest or sum
general 2022-09-05 07:23:42 oh
general 2022-09-05 07:24:02 mechs are pretty complicated I suggest getting familiar with the most of the game mechanics first by building something simpler
general 2022-09-05 07:24:43 a plane or like a car/tank
general 2022-09-05 07:24:57 something that doesn't require extreme coordination and balance
general 2022-09-05 07:25:06 yea that seems simple enough
general 2022-09-05 07:25:18 and then start to make them slowly more complicated by using motors instead of normal wheels
general 2022-09-05 07:25:22 getting familiar with the material types
general 2022-09-05 07:26:09 I suggest making something that can like, transform so you can get used to having a lot of motors moving around and making your build more compact
general 2022-09-05 07:26:18 I meant something that you make yourself
general 2022-09-05 07:26:19 not a tutorial
