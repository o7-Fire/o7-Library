plane-crazy 2021-01-08 04:40:15 help psl
general 2021-01-10 00:37:33 i need a rope that can pull but also support weight
general 2021-01-22 06:04:54 pls make it so you can shiftlock in camera
general 2021-01-22 06:05:10 its very useful cuz shiftlock puts your mouse inthe center of the screen
general 2021-01-22 06:05:37 so if i want a mouse controlled tank turret, i can fire it from a camera
general 2021-01-22 06:06:06 i mean that also makes it easier to aim
general 2021-01-22 06:06:39 who needs buttons when ur firing a tank turret?
general 2021-01-22 06:06:45 u just aim and shoot
general 2021-01-22 06:07:00 and when u need to click a button u just un shift lock
general 2021-01-22 06:07:12 how hard is it to press shift... like bruhhh
general 2021-01-22 06:07:22 lol
general 2021-01-22 06:07:38 LEMME EXPLAIN SIR
general 2021-01-22 06:07:56 so basically i want the camera to rotate along with the turret
general 2021-01-22 06:08:11 but its hard to aim stuff in the sky
general 2021-01-22 06:08:37 but the vehicle blocks ur view of the sky
general 2021-01-22 06:09:15 if u get ur mouse in the perfect center of the screen, u can stop it
general 2021-01-22 06:09:34 exactally
general 2021-01-22 06:09:41 shift lock auto puts ur mouse in the center
general 2021-01-22 06:09:51 it does
general 2021-01-22 06:09:55 xd
general 2021-01-22 06:10:08 shift lock makes ur mouse in the perfect perfect senter
general 2021-01-22 06:10:23 but shift lock doesnt work in cameras unfortunately
general 2021-01-22 06:11:30 i just got the motor 2 to stop
general 2021-01-22 06:11:42 but it would be so much easier with shift lock
general 2021-01-22 06:11:59 wait a sec
general 2021-01-22 06:12:12 nvm
general 2021-01-22 06:12:39 shift lock is also a mini cross hair
general 2021-01-22 06:13:05 when u enter a camera, it basically breaks shift lock
general 2021-01-22 06:13:30 join stream channel to see
general 2021-01-22 06:14:57 bruh
general 2021-01-22 06:16:13 shift lock wont stay in middle if u use a camera
bot-central 2021-01-22 06:17:23 ?suggest
general 2021-01-22 16:42:38 <@!414998453962145792> if you had read the pins in <#507673335816126509> you would have known that they already said **NOT** to suggest a bigger plot size
general 2021-01-22 16:43:26 Shiftlock in cameras?
general 2021-01-22 16:47:37 shift locking and zooming to first person moves ur mouse the the middle, but u cant do either in a camera
general 2021-01-22 18:54:02 why isnt the anchor block anchored?????
general 2021-01-22 18:55:14 anchor block isnt anchoring!!!

general 2021-03-02 23:42:49 Why does the normal jet engine produce more thrust than the huge jet engine
general 2021-03-02 23:43:17 Looks cool
general 2021-03-02 23:43:24 ik
general 2021-03-02 23:43:37 I can hide some super rockets
general 2021-03-02 23:44:49 Also how do I put altitude control on my heli
general 2021-03-02 23:47:12 Also how do I make the heli control like in ptfs
general 2021-03-02 23:47:44 Pilot Training Flight Simulator
general 2021-03-02 23:47:58 No like a mouse controlled heli
general 2021-03-02 23:48:45 If I move my mouse up then the heli moves back and if I move my mouse down I go forward
general 2021-03-02 23:50:13 How to do it
general 2021-03-02 23:51:09 ...
general 2021-03-02 23:51:50 There must be some way
general 2021-03-02 23:52:12 Hmmm
general 2021-04-21 00:08:26 hi
general 2021-07-07 18:10:18 more wedges when
creations-chat 2021-07-08 01:38:32 wow everyone hates my creation
creations-chat 2021-07-08 01:42:39 a plane
general 2021-07-08 01:44:57 i dont understand how people can make super accurate attack jets that can hit a single block on the ground with guns
creations-chat 2021-07-08 02:03:05 it took more than 5 minutes
creations-chat 2021-07-08 02:06:31 u mean spoiler
creations-chat 2021-07-08 02:16:04 huh
creations-chat 2021-07-08 02:39:37 that hurt
general 2021-07-12 15:43:04 since the engines on an a-10 are high up, why doesnt the plane pitch down without any pilot input
general 2021-07-12 15:43:23 wot
general 2021-07-12 15:43:33 ok then
general 2021-07-12 15:44:19 why would u need to handle the recoil all it does is slightly slow down the plane
general 2021-07-12 15:45:34 but the recoil doesnt change the pitch, yaw, or roll of the plane since its perfectly centered
general 2021-07-12 15:45:56 wot
general 2021-07-12 15:46:01 wut u mean
general 2021-07-12 15:46:29 yea its centered
general 2021-07-12 15:46:40 wdym
general 2021-07-12 15:46:43 no its not
general 2021-07-12 15:46:49 the gun is under
general 2021-07-12 15:46:52 no its not
general 2021-07-12 15:47:02 yes
general 2021-07-12 15:47:05 no
general 2021-07-12 15:48:21 it is
general 2021-07-12 15:48:36 yea thats perfectly centered since the firing barrel is on the right side
general 2021-07-12 15:48:47 uh yes it is
general 2021-07-12 15:49:53 yes
general 2021-07-12 17:28:53 im trying to do strafing runs over the spawn base but i suck pls help
general 2021-07-12 17:30:10 ?
general 2021-07-12 17:47:18 the a not 10
general 2021-07-12 17:47:51 a-10 on a budget

general 2021-07-12 17:52:51 lol
general 2021-07-12 17:56:07 yea the a-10 has bisexual wings
general 2021-07-12 18:10:25 sigh i wish there was laser targetting
general 2021-07-12 18:11:25 flying planes in 0 g is so weird
general 2021-07-12 18:11:51 i know
general 2021-07-12 18:19:14 ew wtf why did u need to send that
general 2021-07-12 18:19:57 you could have asked him in dms
general 2021-07-12 18:23:14 re
general 2021-07-12 18:23:54 hi
general 2021-07-12 18:25:07 backwards landing gear cant steer
general 2021-07-12 18:25:47 doesnt work
general 2021-07-12 18:27:41 n o
general 2021-07-12 18:27:56 already is backwards thats why it dont work
general 2021-07-12 18:28:14 im on pc
general 2021-07-12 18:28:24 idot
general 2021-07-12 18:28:49 why does it matter the quality of the build
general 2021-07-12 18:29:07 how does the quality of the build have anything to do with landing gear steering
general 2021-07-12 18:29:13 no?
general 2021-07-12 18:29:17 this isnt creations
general 2021-07-12 18:29:41 no
general 2021-07-12 18:29:47 im so confused
general 2021-07-12 18:29:54 its ok
general 2021-07-12 18:30:28 
general 2021-07-12 18:30:38 thats what a landing gear looks like
general 2021-07-12 18:31:34 its not like i made it smh its the premade landing gear
general 2021-07-12 18:31:57 bruh
general 2021-07-12 18:32:11 then the front landing gear is gonna break
general 2021-07-12 18:32:44 like they need to change the landing gear so the steering isnt based on where the seat is facing
general 2021-07-12 18:33:15 i just turned off the steering for the back gear
general 2021-07-12 18:33:25 worse handling on the ground but its ok
general 2021-07-12 18:33:44 im too lazy to
general 2021-07-12 18:36:21 and plus i dont even know how i would make it without it being exposed
general 2021-07-12 18:37:43 then how about you try to make landing gear that fits in a 1 or 2 block space and isnt exposed
general 2021-07-12 18:39:14 sparklers?
general 2021-07-12 18:39:29 is that supposed to be the wheel
general 2021-07-12 18:46:11 how far does missle tracking go
general 2021-07-12 20:52:00 <@!423474101701836810> is that sketchup
general 2021-07-12 20:52:27 ya
general 2021-07-12 20:52:39 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:20:30 im so confused how do the engines work? when i turned on the rocket engines my plane went 588 speed but when i turned on the jets and propeller my speed stayed the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:24:26 but still shouldnt the jet engines at least make me go faster?
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:25:20 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:26:07 but it should make u go faster
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:26:23 rocket engine + jet engine > rocket engine
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:27:42 hmm idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:30:26 why do the wings make so much drag tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:30:47 like if u have 4 rockets pushing you and you turn off the rockets you would expect it to slowly slow down
plane-crazy 2021-08-12 21:31:03 not stop in 2 seconds
general 2021-08-20 03:46:37 rick will you make it so things that go really fast dont glitch out?
general 2021-08-20 03:47:08 i dont think that will work
general 2021-08-20 03:47:30 for motor 2 speed have 2 settings, speed and reset speed
speed is just speed
reset speed is how fast it resets to the starting position (only works in servo mode)
general 2021-08-20 03:49:00 wdym
general 2021-08-20 03:50:03 like you can resize a 1x1 wedge to be a 1x5 wedge
general 2021-08-20 04:19:14 also one thing that sucks is that wings make so much drag it just doesnt make sense
general 2021-08-20 04:25:36 with the resize tool can you make things like a 2x5 delta wing panel?
general 2021-08-20 04:26:45 <@!217336009455566848> with the resize tool can you make things like a 2x5 delta wing panel?
general 2021-08-20 04:27:31 stink
general 2021-08-20 04:44:41 so big
general 2021-08-20 04:45:26 does autorotation work in game
general 2021-08-20 04:46:37 my first ever car build
creations-chat 2021-08-20 04:47:56 with
general 2021-08-20 04:49:26 AaA
general 2021-08-20 05:00:18 tiny plane
general 2021-09-01 01:31:04 I hope physics is improved with pc2
general 2021-09-01 01:31:29 Hate how having a high or low wing makes planes weird in pc
general 2021-09-01 01:32:30 The resize tool will be sooo helpful
general 2021-09-01 01:32:52 You could make 2x3 delta wing
general 2021-09-01 01:33:24 Would be cool
general 2021-09-01 01:33:49 L o l
general 2021-09-01 01:35:22 Yesss plsss
general 2021-09-01 01:36:07 And be able to adjust acceleration on engines
general 2021-09-26 21:21:15 i want to set multiple keys for 1 motor
general 2021-09-26 21:21:42 like if i press w then it turns 5 degrees and if i hold shift then press w it turns 1 degree
general 2021-09-26 21:22:45 i wish you could have a smaller motor that takes less space
general 2021-09-26 21:24:08 oh wow do server roles get icons now?
general 2021-09-26 22:35:57 resize tool will be so good
general 2021-09-26 22:36:03 1x4 wedge is so steep
general 2021-09-27 00:16:36 pls make it so you can change the max bank angle (instead of just 45) on the premade control surfaces
general 2021-09-27 00:20:04 wait a minute
general 2021-09-27 00:20:23 why is a cylinder heavier than a regular block this makes no sense
general 2021-10-02 01:57:51 simpleplanes is cool
general 2021-10-02 01:58:17 lmao
general 2021-10-03 18:28:51 fun fact: planes are easier to balance than helis
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:30:04 if you want to build a to-scale plane, 1 block is 2 x 2 x 2 feet
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:30:43 1 stud = 1 foot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:31:34 probs trails
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:31:37 uh yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:32:35 u didnt know that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:32:40 or a rope
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:32:55 long thin rope
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:33:06 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:33:17 i guess?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:33:31 WOT bruh
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:33:47 thats assuming a roblox character is a toy
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:01 uh no
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:07 1 stud is 1 foot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:20 1 stud = 1 foot makes more sense for human scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:26 or 0.3 meters
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:34:38 i think someone said its 680 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:35:05 it is tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:35:43 TOY SCALE
1 stud = 5 cm
HUMAN SCALE
1 stud = 1 foot or 0.3 meters
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:08 wait what is speed unit for this game i forgot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:12 sps?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:22 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:33 so 1000 speed in game is about 680 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:36:50 good enough
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:37:45 like 0.6-0.7 meters
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:38:21 yea thats assuming character is a toy
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:38:39 whats it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:39:07 but then 2 blocks is like 6 feet...
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:39:19 6 feet is way taller than average height
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:39:40 2 meters is legit 6 foot 6
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:40:24 the default roblox character is 6 foot 6 then?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:40:54 so i guess ur builds are quite big then lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:41:49 guys tell rick to make it so you can change snap to grid, and make it so you can put blocks inside of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:13 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:23 so 1000sps in toy scale is 1110 mph?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:31 or was that a typo
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:46 for 100sps
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:42:57 he sais 100sps in toy scale is 111 mph
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:08 😕
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:13 yes please
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:19 no toys pls
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:23 this is a human game
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:43:34 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:18 CLOSE ENOUGH PLUS RTHRO IS HUMAN
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:20 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:42 even if it doesnt look like a human
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:49 humans fly planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:44:54 toys cant fly planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:45:16 point is
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:45:18 no toys
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:45:21 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:46:31 lmao no
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 18:47:01 no its 8 million miles per millisecond
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:12:19 you made that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:12:29 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 19:13:30 rocket powered ship
general 2021-10-03 21:12:22 ugly thing i made but it works, can take off and land with gear up and from water
general 2021-10-03 21:12:55 its ugly ok sorry
general 2021-10-03 21:13:46 oop sorry
general 2021-10-03 21:14:07 <@!603974932585644043> what about this
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:15:25 gib feedback its a weird tiltrotor abomination i made
general 2021-11-04 01:37:10 does anyone else think the in-game wings create a lot of drag?
general 2021-11-04 01:37:57 but like the drag is so high
general 2021-11-04 01:38:48 its so much drag though
general 2021-11-04 01:39:01 and the in-game wings dont actually create lift
general 2021-11-04 01:39:30 since they are just flat rectangles
general 2021-11-04 01:40:02 but no lift at an angle of incidence of 0
general 2021-11-04 01:40:58 that just makes even more drag than there already is
general 2021-11-04 01:41:26 lmao
general 2021-11-04 01:41:48 i was replying to that dudes message
general 2021-11-04 01:42:11 not in-game they dont
general 2021-11-04 01:42:20 unless you increase the angle of incidence
general 2021-11-04 01:42:28 thats my point
general 2021-11-04 01:43:11 but the in-game wings add tons of drag without giving any lift
general 2021-11-04 01:43:31 whereas real wings add some drag but give some lift
general 2021-11-04 01:45:56 once the update comes out i will finally be able to make a beam of this
general 2021-11-04 01:49:08 its a face!
general 2021-11-04 01:50:32 all the aircraft carriers ive seen in game are smaller than a real aircraft carrier
general 2021-11-04 01:51:39 resize tool = less blocks = less lag
general 2021-11-04 01:51:58 why not?
general 2021-11-04 01:52:29 no?
general 2021-11-04 01:52:58 if u have regular block and a 1x4 beam it takes the same like power
general 2021-11-04 01:56:16 does aspect ratio do anything in-game?
general 2021-11-04 01:58:03 when resize tool comes will you be able to resize control surfaces? like a 2x4 control surface or somethinhg
general 2021-11-04 03:35:46 looks kinda like a rafael
general 2021-11-04 03:35:52 or however you spell it
general 2021-11-05 02:15:15 top left
general 2021-11-05 02:16:07 lol
general 2021-11-05 02:18:08 has anyone made an x-29
general 2021-11-05 02:20:00 cursed
general 2021-11-06 20:37:57 it looks pretty nice
general 2021-11-06 20:38:08 better than anything i could make
general 2021-11-07 01:22:47 whats the smallest/lightest working plane you can make in the game
general 2021-11-07 01:25:01 but thats not the smallest or the lightest
general 2021-11-07 05:10:39 lol if u set ballast to 9.7 or 8.7 it auto resets to 9.69 or 8.69
general 2021-11-12 02:28:15 i dont like how if you have high mounted engines and low mounted wings then plane will pitch down a ton
general 2021-11-12 02:29:35 will physics be improved in pc2
general 2021-11-12 02:32:46 i hope we will be able to make smaller swashplate in pc2

general 2021-11-14 23:29:03 does jetpack save to pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:05 does dihedral angle affect roll stability?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:28 i havent tested it before
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:36 oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:58 k
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:31:21 also why blocks dont have drag
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:31:38 and wing panels create more drag then blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:31:47 makes no sense imo
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:32:35 i hope there is at least very simple aerodynamic physics in pc2
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:32:49 u cant
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:02 ye
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:19 i mean you might be able to do roll with motor 2 using like gears or some shit idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:40 😂
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:34:19 ~~you can cram a gear system in it~~
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:38:07 pls rick pls add real afterburning turbofan so we dont have to do this
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:47:28 just respawn <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 04:41:39 ok dihedral and anhedral angle does seem to have an effect on roll stability
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 04:42:32 well some ppl said that it doesnt work in plane crazy so its not common knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 05:01:40 through the combination of dihedral and some other thing (idk what its called) ive created a perfectly stable plane, if you knock it off course it will go back to its stable orientation without use input

ik its ugly its just a test plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 21:35:54 how do i stop the wings from flapping
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 21:37:59 ik its ugly, its just something i tried to make to counter the prop torque
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 21:38:25 it flies pretty well
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 21:39:27 k
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 21:42:21 overall it flies quite stable for a prop driven plane
general 2021-11-25 21:50:29 motors that go up to 100 speed pls add rick
general 2021-11-25 21:53:31 🤮
general 2021-11-25 21:55:01 💩
general 2021-11-27 21:31:25 hi
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 23:36:51 Sucks when someone makes a prop plane but the prop blades are frickin wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 05:37:02 anyone else see this?
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 05:37:24 nvm its gone now
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 05:37:55 nvm its back
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 05:38:57 ok

plane-crazy 2021-12-23 05:14:04 basically lock motor but not as funni
general 2021-12-26 22:48:36 does anyone have a good 7x7 cylinder design
general 2021-12-31 03:56:52 what does the legacy setting on rocket launchers do?
general 2021-12-31 03:59:51 yes?
plane-crazy 2022-01-01 00:54:45 Smooth cylinders when
general 2022-01-08 03:19:23 i want to be able to change the friction of an unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:07:13 i want blocks to have less weight, and wing panels to have less drag overall
since rn if u have ur wings (center of lift) above or below your engines (center of thrust) your plane will pitch unless you have some sort of way to counter the pitch
and is kinda annoying
would be nice if instead of the center of lift being a sphere, it was just like a thin cylinder
and engines could be anywhere up or down along that cylinder of the center of lift
but like if u have engines below the center of mass, then it pitches up
so the yellow sphere just has to be somewhere along the center of lift line (cylinder), and the center of engines just has to be in the middle left-right, but anywhere up-down
idk if i explained that right
but yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:08:29 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:08:38 too much work
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:09:22 ok i need to simplify it first
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:18:39 ok i put it in <#507673335816126509> is it right?

plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:10:13 i want to set things to specific angles and keep it locked in place
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:10:56 cameras can angle lock?
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:12:00 what if i want to use a motor 2 without it like flapping around
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:12:20 cuz like u cant really use cameras for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:12:36 maybe u  can idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:13:30 like i used motor 2's to make my wings have dihedral, but when i turn, the wings flap around
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 02:14:09 also i want to have 2 different speeds for motor 2, normal speed and reset speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:34:33 nose a bit weird
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:37:09 can i see the intake from the front?
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:37:38 seems a bit short
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:37:52 make it slightly longer
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:38:21 no i mean the whole plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:38:32 just like 1 or 2 blocks longer
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:44:12 bigger control surfaces, smaller wings, use blocks in wing because wing panels increase drag (reduces speed and manueverability)
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 04:45:58 your mian wing is very far forward, and this part is so thick
plane-crazy 2022-02-03 05:29:17 add a premade turboprop engine

like this
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 04:27:15 does anyone else think wings have too much drag?
general 2022-02-23 19:42:18 Will they add better premade turbofan in pc2?

plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:44:39 Nice landing gear
general 2022-03-05 21:45:11 If you use the premade gear, do you need to have trim?
general 2022-03-05 21:45:28 Cause retracting the gear moves the center of mass back by a lot
general 2022-03-05 21:45:54 It really is tho
general 2022-03-05 21:46:29 I don’t like planes where you need to spam a key to stay straight
general 2022-03-05 21:46:56 That was my question
general 2022-03-05 21:47:13 Not just the gear
general 2022-03-05 21:47:41 Like being able to change the pitch of the horizontal stabilizer
general 2022-03-05 21:48:10 Wdym
general 2022-03-05 21:48:46 Cause it affects center of mass
general 2022-03-05 21:51:20 It changes a lot when you have 3 gears and small wings
general 2022-03-05 21:51:40 Large planes aren’t affected much
general 2022-03-05 21:52:15 1 sec
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:53:28 I took off the gears but it’s this
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:54:19 Stability test
plane-crazy 2022-03-05 21:54:48 Roll and pitch stability mostly since yaw is already stable

general 2022-03-05 21:57:40 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 01:18:57 looks alright but its not perfectly balanced
general 2022-03-13 01:21:47 since you cant make automatic stability in plane crazy, if you want a stable key-controlled plane, you either have to use static stability or constantly tap a key

This is just a demo
creations-chat 2022-04-14 05:34:48 Supposed to be neutral stability, uses split flap thingys to yaw instead of a rudder (more drag on one side), uses canard + rear control surface for pitch

general 2022-04-15 10:37:27 https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Deceleron
Does anyone know how to make this? I really wanna figure this out
general 2022-04-15 10:38:13 Wot
general 2022-04-15 10:38:44 nah I’m fine
general 2022-04-15 10:39:45 How
general 2022-04-15 10:41:21 In game it kinda is just neutral stability tho
general 2022-04-15 10:41:38 So it’s not that bad
general 2022-04-15 10:42:35 Problem is you need like 3 separate keys
general 2022-04-15 10:43:35 And if I wanna do yaw as well then it’s even worse
general 2022-04-15 10:44:31 The mechanic for that would also be terrible
general 2022-04-15 10:44:46 Since u can’t put multiple keys on one block
general 2022-04-15 10:45:06 You’d have to like stack 3 or 4 motors to make it work or something
general 2022-04-15 10:45:31 Yea
general 2022-04-15 10:46:01 Would be so useful to be able to put multiple key binds on a motor
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:51:58 You need lift
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:52:11 Symmetric airfoils aren’t great for that
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:53:04 Show a video
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:53:53 Couldn’t u just use conveyor wedge
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:59:47 Move engines down, move wings forward

plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:14:25 I’ve never realized that the fuel tanks actually get lighter as you spend more fuel
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:15:05 Why did they choose fuel tanks to make realistic
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:15:19 No one even uses them
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:15:55 Nahhh
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:16:04 Not more
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:16:08 Most*
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:16:41 Isn’t that a ROBLOX thing
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:16:55 Also grass cubes
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:17:00 And water sucks
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:17:14 And blocks have no drag
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:17:49 And wings have terrible lift to drag ratio (but Rick says will be fixed in pc2)
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:17:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:18:21 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:20:36 Also sometimes I see people flying their jets in videos constantly tapping a key to keep their plane straight, why is that?
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:21:24 I love my aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:21:34 No need to spam buttons
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:21:58 I meant it looks terrible
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:22:05 Uhh
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:22:17 Ok 1 sec
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:22:21 Video?
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:22:39 K 1 sec gotta get in game
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:23:17 Ima say straight up, it looks shit, it’s just for testing
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:25:48 
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:25:56 It’s so sensitive to weight that it goes off balance if I jump out
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:26:02 I’m just that fat
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:26:33 I thought I told you
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:27:25 It’s mainly just to show that vertical stabilizer is not needed
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:27:49 No hidden wings inside, and it has full yaw control
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:28:09 I agree but my laptop broke 2 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:28:26 So I kinda just have to deal with mobile for the next 5 years
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:29:20 I have like a desktop pc, but it’s like 20 years old and is slower than my school laptop
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:30:01 I actually don’t care how my builds look
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:30:12 I’m mainly waiting for pc2 to do that
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:30:23 Rn I’m just doing random test planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:31:28 This is the laptop we get
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:36:13 Meh I go for function over design
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:36:59 It can go faster
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:37:16 Less complex cuz no funni collision
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:37:25 And less drag
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:37:37 And more compact
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:37:43 Lemme see
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:38:03 It’s like half the drag compared to a wing panel
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:42:51 It can go to about 510
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:43:44 Damn without glitch engines?
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:44:03 Ok bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:44:14 I consider that a glitch engine
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:45:09 If I added hover engine it could prolly go way faster
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:45:15 Too lazy tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 04:51:48 Nice now make an f-20
general 2022-04-21 14:48:03 Imagine making oversized builds
general 2022-04-21 14:50:57 Needs to be 1.3-1.4 wide

plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:00:28 Custom mini fighter jet
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:00:48 Really basic
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:00:57 Minimal motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:01:50 Vert stabilizer bad
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:02:04 Just extra drag and weight
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:02:08 No need
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:02:27 Didn’t know where to put it lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:06 No???
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:27 Vert stabilizer doesn’t affect roll
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:32 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:43 Some of it is ice
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:03:56 It’s already pretty stable
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:25 Like 1 delta 1x1 and one control surface 1x1
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:41 I could use decelerons for yaw but too lazy
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:04:59 If I use deceleron for yaw I could remove them
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:05:27 Inspired by x-36
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:05:56 The tailless part lmao
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:06:01 Everything else isn’t
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:06:41 Because they have a skill issue and they need it
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:07:42 I can obtain stability with my flight control computer
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:08:13 I have stupidly fast fingers
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:08:18 Trust me
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:09 I mean you can achieve artificial stability in a rocket using thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:09:35 I mean I have horizontal stabs
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:15 I mean the huge things in the back
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:10:48 stabilators*
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:11:15 Wdym bro
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:11:36 It’s elevator + stabilizer in one
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:11:42 It’s called a stabilator
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:12:12 Stable since I have fast fingers
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:13:52 Stabilator, no vertical component in the stabilator
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:14:35 You don’t wanna know
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:14:51 Not necessarily needed

plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:17:34 Idk but probably if you really wanted to
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:19:13 And?
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:19:57 How does the vert stab have anything to do with roll tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:22 I don’t know bro but my plane rolls perfectly fine without one
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:20:48 Helps, but you can stabilize the vertical axis without one
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:12 Well it can
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:21:48 It have pitch control, it has yaw control, and it has ailerons
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:22:03 Still works without them
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:22:30 I’ll show u one without any wings inside
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:31:04 https://streamable.com/603l2f
No wings hidden inside, maneuvers decent
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:31:20 And has full control
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:32:44 No
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:32:55 It’s all key controlled
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:33:32 Rolls?
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:33:52 That’s adverse yaw
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:35:36 I am aware
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 05:35:54 Neutral stability

creations-chat 2022-04-25 23:07:42 <@719178114898591773> now remove the vertical surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 23:11:21 Now that I think about it, premade control surfaces is basically extremely rudimentary fly-by-wire but much worse
creations-chat 2022-04-26 04:20:10 The vertical wing panels at the rear
help 2022-04-26 04:23:31 No it’s the front
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:26:06 Why is the engine mounted in the middle of the wing like that
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:26:46 Move the wing higher up and add anhedral
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:26:57 Cuz rn it’s impaling someone’s head
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:27:30 And how is that a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:27:42 Or did I read that wrong
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:29:32 Matters way more in pc than it does irl
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:30:41 Wdym lmao
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:31:20 As long as it’s close enough to the center it’s fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:32:47 It’s usually designed to be centered horizontally, but it can still fly fine even if not cuz stabilizer, and vertically it doesn’t matter that much, cuz stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:32:59 It’s 2 sentences my guy
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:33:05 1 sentence

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:44:36 Wot
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:45:30 Yes?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:47:05 For most aircraft it’s in a similar location
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 04:47:48 It doesn’t matter aerodynamically but is helpful sometimes for balance

plane-crazy 2022-04-26 05:21:56 I’ve never understood how unicycles work
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 05:22:50 But won’t the wheel have a rotational torque
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 05:22:54 I don’t know
creations-chat 2022-04-26 14:27:07 The whole thing moves?
creations-chat 2022-04-26 14:28:51 Also a rudder is a vertical surface too
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:35:14 I’ve never had this issue, “raise surface” deflects the surface down, to create more lift, raising the surface up. The green arrow is the bottom so if you keep it on the lowest part, control surfaces work fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:36:10 That’s the problem tho, I don’t think it’s a bug
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:36:19 It’s never happened to me
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:36:42 On the premade control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:38:11 And they made sure the green arrow is the “bottom part”?
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:40:11 Interesting
plane-crazy 2022-04-26 14:44:35 I hope we can make smooth fuselages in pc2

general 2022-04-28 00:51:11 Wdym
general 2022-04-28 23:00:17 Canards + stabilator + thrust vectoring used together gives superior pitch control
general 2022-04-28 23:02:55 If I tap the key for the elevators quickly then my plane shakes, but if I hold it for a second then release it doesn’t shake

plane-crazy 2022-04-29 13:07:43 Cuz a ROBLOX leg is 1 stud wide
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 13:08:15 So 2 ROBLOX legs is 2 studs
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 13:08:29 And a pc block is 2 ROBLOX legs wide

general 2022-04-29 13:23:57 Everyone here using fake rotors, hover engine rotors, or an even number of rotors
Why can’t you just make a single rotor heli using the premade motor, then use the tail rotor to counter the torque? I don’t expect anyone to use a swashplate for control cuz it’s way too bulky, but once pc2 releases I better see you all use swashplates in ur helis

general 2022-04-29 13:25:44 The part about everyone using fake rotors or hover engine rotors
general 2022-04-29 13:26:56 How about on light builds that don’t need a faster spin speed
general 2022-04-29 13:27:19 That was a joke lmao
general 2022-04-29 13:27:29 I don’t know how u can’t tell
general 2022-04-29 13:29:29 Ok and?
general 2022-04-29 13:34:03 Tldr, basic motor has torque and is able to be countered with tail rotor but easier to just use “tip jets” or fake rotors, fake rotors may look better, but hover engine rotors definitely don’t
general 2022-04-29 13:34:48 No.
general 2022-04-29 13:35:07 I have morals
general 2022-04-29 13:35:29 Yea but it’s possible if you really tried
general 2022-04-29 13:37:25 Also for the driveshaft thing, you can just balance the motor speeds since I think heli rotors don’t change rpm in flight? Correct me if I’m wrong

It’s pretty hard
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 23:29:33 Sure
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:13:58 1. It’s rocket powered rotors so no effort needed to balance
2. Pendulum effect of the rotors causes heli to self stabilize
Rest is just ballast so yea I don’t think having your heli be balanced is impressive
creations-chat 2022-05-06 23:19:40 Anyone wanna try to make a simple single rotor heli that uses the tail rotor for counter torque? No fake or rocket/hover engine powered rotors.
Doesn’t need to move too much, just needs to be capable of hovering, yaw, and collective

plane-crazy 2022-05-14 02:38:35 Not for the rotor cuz I wanna use a motor for that

plane-crazy 2022-05-14 02:39:06 And then I can counter it

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:47:56 this is the turret in build mode, its a pain in the arse to do anything in it
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:48:22 like its pretty cramped already
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:50:29 not a rocket as the main gun
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:50:53 too big
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:50:59 im gonna try to use sparkler

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:54:18 also i dont think ill be able to elevate or depress the main gun cuz the turret is so cramped
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:54:42 i could try using an oscillating turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:54:46 
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:55:11 rotates at the hinge to change the angle of the gun
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:57:08 239 blocks now oop
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 00:58:31 its a little long so im gonna shorten it by 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:11:46 shortened by 1 block, same # of seats, removed wheels cuz too small, removed turret to work on new turret but kept turret basket
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:32:04 if my ifv is behind a hill in the hull down position, this is all you can see of the the turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:32:37 thats the advantage of an oscillating turret

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:41:12 which part
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:41:29 well its because
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:41:35 thats how i decided it should be
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:45:03 landing gear?
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:45:23 then no because how are u gonna retract it after u take off
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:46:27 ?
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:46:41 it retracts correctly in the air?
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:46:52 ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:55:14 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 01:55:41 is it stuck from friction or is it something else?

plane-crazy 2022-05-22 03:59:59 you can sit in it tho
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:00:48 i could add a seat in the turret but then it'd be cramped af
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:03:01 wait when i spawn it in, the first person view is like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 04:03:31 but if i hop out and hop back in it turns into this for osme reason

plane-crazy 2022-05-25 04:35:37 still kinda spacious
general 2022-05-25 14:38:37 i have an idea, we should just tell bad guys to stop and that its not ok
general 2022-05-25 14:39:09 yes
general 2022-05-25 14:39:55 yes
general 2022-05-25 14:43:14 i mean i feel like my school is pretty safe even without campus police
general 2022-05-25 14:44:34 guns arent like super hard to make so if we ban guns ppl will just build that gun from rust
general 2022-05-25 14:45:16 we should just ban violence, ez
general 2022-05-25 14:47:01 was the school shooting during school hours or was it right before or right after school?
general 2022-05-25 14:47:22 cuz if it was during school hours shouldnt the doors have been locked
general 2022-05-25 14:48:15 sure but there wont be anyone in the hallways
general 2022-05-25 14:48:34 and even if it does punch through a 2 inch metal door, its gonna lose a lot of energy
general 2022-05-25 14:49:15 like i said theres only gonna be like 2 ppl in the halls during school hours
general 2022-05-25 14:49:26 only like 5 minutes of time with lots of ppl in the hallways
general 2022-05-25 14:49:50 how? they cant even get into the school???

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:10:02 first time using angle lock idk how to use
help 2022-06-05 00:13:35 how do i improve the anglelock
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:38:48 no exposed motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:38:43 u cant make true thrust vectoring in pc cuz theres no thrust vectoring nozzles
creations-chat 2022-06-05 01:40:18 sometimes i cant paste photos after playing pc but then once i leave the game i can again
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:41:22 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:41:27 oh u mean like custom?
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:41:58 yea i feel like that would be kinda difficult
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:42:30 it would have to be small enough and it would have to be able to "bend"
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:48:15 i thought it needed like the slats or whatever that form the nozzle

general 2022-06-05 21:32:31 i wanna make it so the rockets drop first then go forward if its being launched out of an internal bay
creations-chat 2022-06-05 23:23:36 need feedback
custom mini fighter jet with an internal weapon bay
this is my first anglelock build so its kinda trash but yea
i tried making afterburners but they're kinda shitty
creations-chat 2022-06-05 23:30:02 thanks for the feedback bro, so helpful
creations-chat 2022-06-05 23:39:24 added ejection seat marking in the wrong place and the seat cant eject, also no intakes and they are too far forward but i cant really move them back
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 23:54:33 bruh the 1x0.9 block isnt actually 1x0.9
creations-chat 2022-06-05 23:59:12 why not? it doesnt need any more
creations-chat 2022-06-06 01:09:38 is this better
creations-chat 2022-06-06 01:11:42 idk how to make intakes so yea thats the best i can do for now
creations-chat 2022-06-06 01:21:02 bro wdym its literally an f-35 tiger VIIIV
general 2022-06-06 04:19:17 ?
general 2022-06-06 04:19:32 what happened
general 2022-06-06 04:19:52 why?
general 2022-06-06 04:20:12 just randomly for no reason?
general 2022-06-06 04:20:34 wat
general 2022-06-06 04:20:42 what about pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:23:33 is pc2 cancelled
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:23:57 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:24:19 pc2 will be so good
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:24:30 you will be able to put custom code into blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:24:53 and you will be able to draw pictures on blocks instead of just painting the whole thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:04 and will have 0 lag
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:20 radar
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:25 infrared
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:32 ye
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:48 planes will have radar cross section
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:25:57 and modern avionics hopefully
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:26:01 pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:26:39 it will probably have as much lag as a plain baseplate
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:28:30 pc2 will have insane graphics and no lag
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:28:38 better than msfs or dcs
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:29:09 microsoft flight sim 2020, digital combat simulator
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:29:56 i cant make anything that exists irl, everything i make is "custom" because i tried to make something but it turned out wrong
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:30:22 "custom" piece of crap
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:30:34 like bro what r those intakes
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:31:00 in pc2 you will be able to make blender-quality builds
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:31:05 maybe even better
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:31:29 in pc2 the main pilot seat will be an actual pilot seat
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:31:50 pc2 will have realistic aerodynamics, so the fuselage actually affects performance
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:33:26 nah itll be easier than building now
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:33:35 no motorlock or anglelock needed
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 04:34:11 essentially yea

plane-crazy 2022-06-09 02:34:33 need some feedback on vert stabs, first time making canted stabs
contest-chat 2022-06-09 02:36:09 does J-20 count?
contest-chat 2022-06-09 02:39:29 nvm no jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:04:34 ok so my jet is mostly done, only thing i want to fix is, its so stable laterally, so whenever i roll and let go of the keybind, the plane will automatically roll back, with the canopy on top, this makes it hard to do manuvers
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:05:18 i know why its so stable
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:05:24 but i just dont have space to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:05:36 basically the com is too low
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:06:01 i put it in the center so that wouldnt cause that
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:06:20 the helium is just for balancing
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:06:34 no they are all off
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:07:01 no, it recenters because of the vert stabs i just cant fit ballast to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:07:19 it is full wasd lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:07:23 no mouse controls
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:08:19 ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:08:21 ye
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:09:54 thats only if the helium lowers the com, but in this case it doesnt lower the com because the helium (which is essentially negative weight) is placed low
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:11:22 in a 90 degree bank, red is center of mass, green is main wings, blue is vertical stabilizer

so the very stab will cause the plane to roll back
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:11:44 this is viewing the plane from front or back
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:11:56 powerpoint lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:12:02 only thing ik how to use
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:14:00 ive tried full mouse control, what i did was i put m2m for pitch and yaw, and then the premade control surfaces for roll, cuz it will bank left to turn left and its nice to have artificial roll stabilizing (i personally dont like static/natural roll stabilizing)
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:15:27 why are the intakes directly behind the canards?
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:17:29 pc2 will
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:17:58 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:43:27 no exposed motors
contest-chat 2022-06-09 23:44:09 no because its just a block
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:54:01 how do you get angle lock to be a specific angle?
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:54:15 kinda like maxangle on motor 2, except its for anglelock
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:54:40 im using a cylinder but it doesnt turn enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:55:01 it barely cants
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:58:26 to limit how far the motor can turn
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:58:46 i want a different block that allows a little bit more angle but not too much
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:58:56 its anglelock
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:59:02 so u gotta use locked motor 1s
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:59:29 i tried cutter
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 23:59:32 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:00:08 then id have to eyeball the angle
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:00:15 and itll be different each time
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:00:18 and look weird
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:02:41 cant really make those work
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:02:50 cuz it cant weld to the other blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:03:35 then the angle will be too wide
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:03:59 then itll weld to the other motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:04:23 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:04:25 i cant
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:04:34 it literally doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:04:42 canted vert stabs
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:05:56 ye
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:08:01 ok whatever its good enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:17:56 no shaders weird gradient effect
contest-chat 2022-06-10 00:18:39 u made like 20% of the build how are we supposed to give feedback
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:21:10 show the settings
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:45:17 they should
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:45:29 is the set controls automatically setting on?
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:45:46 try deleting them and re-placing them
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:47:32 wait i didnt know the f-14 was that big
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 00:47:59 bru
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:00:39 honestly i would use full mouse control, but you cant turn your camera or move your mouse around
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:00:56 if there was a way to lock the premade control surfaces, i would use them
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 02:08:47 i need some feedback on my plane, join vip 1 if you can help

creations-chat 2022-06-10 02:34:34 thanks bro thats so helpful i could totally improve my plane based on what you told me

plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:23:08 What’s the point of custom gear on fighter jets? The wheels can’t roll and can’t steer most of the time, also they are very large
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:23:28 And takes up a lot of space
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:23:44 Not really
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:25:40 I get that’s it’s a navy jet so it needs beefier gear, but the half wedges make it look ugly
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:25:56 Just my honest opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:27:55 Then it looks invisible or 2D
general 2022-06-10 23:28:56 Caption: F-5 🤓
general 2022-06-10 23:29:54 Also F-5 is tiger not freedom fighter
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:30:41 For the fuselage yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:31:16 Not for the cockpit
general 2022-06-10 23:31:33 Interesting
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:32:01 Second
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:33:34 I don’t like 3 wide cockpits
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:34:12 Ye that’s what I meant
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:35:08 1-1.5 wide cockpit on most jets, 2-4 wide fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:37:00 Forgor what the y means but it’s never the same as the production or would-be production model
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 23:37:58 Very large missiles, basically everything is large

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 05:14:35 make the nose shorter
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 05:15:06 or slightly fatter on the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 05:15:12 it just looks too sharp
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:08:49 just shoot something heavy very fast using magnet or spring
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:16 show vid
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:32 does it recoil by shooting an actual projectile?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:11:52 bruh thats lame
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:12:26 its like making stuff drive and steer on the ground using propellers
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:12:48 but the projectile being fired doesnt cause the recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:13:30 then dont make it a solid cylinder???
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:14:10 how bout wait for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:14:50 pc2 is gonna come out within 2 months
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:15:21 why u tryna add recoil to recoilless weapons?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:15:31 rockets and fireworks dont have recoil
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 17:50:35 is mine tiny or is his just huge

general 2022-06-14 00:34:52 ok at least i know now that my jet isnt the smallest
bug-reports 2022-06-14 00:58:55 has anyone encountered a bug with character weight randomly changing by very small amounts? jetpack is not sending me upwards, but ill have a balanced plane, save it, wait a while, load it in, and when i fly it again its completely unbalanced

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:50:34 i feel like the rank requirements should be more interesting and not just block count
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:51:43 like for planes, maybe having a speed requirement, and being small and accurate enough to pass through a certain sized hoop
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:58:34 how u gon see anything out of ur cockpit?

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 22:29:30 yah
general 2022-07-26 22:33:41 make it so locked motors dont contract by half a block its kinda annoying sometimes
general 2022-07-26 22:34:25 gets stuck into other blocks and stuff
general 2022-07-26 22:34:30 ?
general 2022-07-26 22:35:19 it literally serves no purpose tho
general 2022-07-26 22:35:35 how
general 2022-07-26 22:36:05 why do you need motorlocking if you can achieve a better result using better building tools
general 2022-07-26 22:36:42 i thought i deleted that
general 2022-07-26 22:37:22 delete
general 2022-07-26 22:37:25 delete
general 2022-07-26 22:39:16 honestly whats the point of motorlock, its lower quality, takes up more blocks, and u can literally get a better result with less time
general 2022-07-26 22:39:53 u can do that without motorlock
general 2022-07-26 22:40:28 u can with a better building tool
general 2022-07-26 22:40:58 motorlock literally just puts blocks inside each other
general 2022-07-26 22:41:26 ok but why would u use motorlock to do that if u can just use a tool to do that
general 2022-07-26 22:41:39 motorlock just requires more time and blocks
general 2022-07-26 22:42:04 how
general 2022-07-26 22:42:55 at least i dont play build a boat, unlike you
general 2022-07-26 22:44:55 motorlock basically limits the quality of builds to a certain point
general 2022-07-26 22:45:26 like we will never be able to make builds that look so close to real life that you cant tell it was made in plane crazy
general 2022-07-26 22:46:08 well I havent seen any
general 2022-07-26 22:46:48 like we have to use emojis for cockpits since theres no analog flight instruments
general 2022-07-26 22:47:13 ?
general 2022-07-26 22:50:59 horn
general 2022-07-26 22:52:22 f3x sucks
general 2022-07-26 22:53:25 f3x is harder to use compared to motorlock
general 2022-07-26 22:54:24 im talking about a tool that would let you make something the same as with motorlock, but would be easy to use and use less blocks
general 2022-07-26 22:55:55 doesnt show accurate center of mass
general 2022-07-26 22:56:28 ?
how are u supposed to nerf motorlock
general 2022-07-26 22:57:09 how
general 2022-07-26 22:57:34 yea but its hard to know where to place it
general 2022-07-26 22:57:44 left right, and front back is easy, but top down is hard
general 2022-07-26 22:58:36 how do you accurately tell if the center of mass is too high or too low
general 2022-07-26 22:59:58 ok
general 2022-07-26 23:00:07 fly-by-wire when
general 2022-07-26 23:00:25 but with motorlock, the center of mass changes when you spawn in
general 2022-07-26 23:00:36 lol
general 2022-07-26 23:00:46 i love artestors
general 2022-07-26 23:01:35 f||a||x
general 2022-07-26 23:02:44 its kinda hard tho since theres 3 different things you have to balance simultaneously, blue circle, yellow circle, and center of thrust
general 2022-07-26 23:03:52 drier than chewing burnt toast

general 2022-08-16 01:19:51 Fun idea
general 2022-08-16 01:21:21 Stop using helium balloons
general 2022-08-16 01:21:28 We are running out of helium
general 2022-08-16 01:21:58 Huh
general 2022-08-16 01:22:19 Or just don’t use airships
general 2022-08-16 01:22:28 Yes they are efficient
general 2022-08-16 01:23:08 But once the helium leaves earth, it just dissipates into space and becomes nearly impossible to retrieve
general 2022-08-16 01:23:29 Just make more efficient planes
general 2022-08-16 01:23:43 What r those for
general 2022-08-16 01:24:10 Oh
general 2022-08-16 01:25:34 If you let go of a helium balloon and let it fly up, that helium is probably never coming back. This, and leakage from industrial uses and harvesting helium is why we are running out
general 2022-08-16 01:26:05 Fun

help 2022-08-16 02:29:28 Rudder will make the plane roll slightly.
help 2022-08-16 02:29:57 Because of the way it’s positioned
help 2022-08-16 02:30:43 Not home rn so I can’t make a diagram
help 2022-08-16 02:30:57 But basically since the rudder is above the center of mass
help 2022-08-16 02:31:45 When you yaw left, the rudder is providing a force towards the right, which rolls the plane to the right

creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:13:18 Show
general 2022-08-16 03:14:37 Ok idea for hybrid regional airliner:
2-2 or 3-3
Low-mounted standard regional jet wing
1 electric propeller mounted under each wing
Battery between the 2 wings in the cargo compartment below
Small turbofan with s-duct where the apu would be
Nose gear fitted with electric motors for taxiing
still has the ram air turbine thing to generate electricity in emergencies

Optional: curved solar panels at the top
help 2022-08-16 03:29:36 Yea since it kinda will act like mini ailerons when it’s canted
help 2022-08-16 03:30:19 Might be hard to counter since it’s m2m
help 2022-08-16 03:32:18 Nose looks weird
help 2022-08-16 03:32:28 Can’t see over the nose from cockpit
help 2022-08-16 03:32:46 Wings are too long and pointy
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 19:28:46 Engine is above the top wing
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 20:39:35 Why do I feel like building is sometimes inefficient?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 20:39:43 Not a skill issue

general 2022-08-16 20:43:07 I want to be able to spawn it then immediately start flying or driving or sailing

general 2022-08-17 04:27:09 Or like a gripen or hal tejas
general 2022-08-17 04:28:00 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-17 13:23:24 But it’s still exposed tho
plane-crazy 2022-08-17 13:23:50 Adding more motors just makes it more exposed
plane-crazy 2022-08-17 13:24:00 Which may or may not make it look worse

plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:14:43 idk i kinda went for like this size
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:18:07 ok, i will replace the wing with regular wing panels, not sure what you mean by big and goofy main gear, the main gear is supposed to be beefier compared to the nose gear because the main gear is supporting most of the weight
base game missiles may look big but its still smaller than custom missles
ill just remove the missiles for now
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:22:32 is this better?

help 2022-08-28 21:57:40 dunno what you mean by that
help 2022-08-28 21:58:48 well yea they wont be in the same spot in build mode, but once you spawn in, the center of mass has to be at the same spot as the center of wing panels
help 2022-08-28 21:59:33 wdym by no way to balance an f-22
help 2022-08-28 22:00:05 why not?
help 2022-08-28 22:01:06 simple solution, put wing panels in the nose, and make the nose/cockpit ice

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:17:41 ok wtf is that
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:21:15 this is kinda annoying
general 2022-08-28 22:24:11 only reason you cant glide very far in pc is because the wings have a stupidly low lift to drag ratio
general 2022-08-28 22:24:37 u need to be ranked
general 2022-08-28 22:24:43 <#925563336500871268>
general 2022-08-28 22:27:49 fun fact
the reason planes in pc turn in water when you roll is because the lower wing which is submerged experiences more drag compared to the higher wing which is out of the water, which turns the plane in the direction you rolled in

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 02:53:30 i just need to know what other features fly-by-wire software includes
general 2022-09-15 02:55:43 help, i have to make a programming project for a class, its a self-guided project where you come up with the project idea (it could be almost anything) and you have to make it. My idea was to create software for a fly-by-wire system, what i need now is just a simple list of features
like boeings fly-by-wire optimizes the wing camber using the flaps to achieve more efficient flight
also has flight envelope protection
but idk what other features they have
the entire class is just about making this project so i have the entire semester, but I need to know what features i need to make now
general 2022-09-15 02:56:11 so yea if you know any features included in fly-by-wire software that I havent mentioned, pls lmk asap

general 2022-09-15 02:59:16 class description:
This class is a self-paced course in computer science. The course is best for students who can be self-motivated and driven. The scope of the specifics are very broad. In prior years students have taught themselves new programming languages, created and published websites, or created applications to augment bicycles, interpret pictures and text, or created and published games on steam.
The majority of score is credited by the work you choose to do, and the teacher approves. Execution is rewarded in this class. In other words, simply setting an objective gets no score. However, delivery of the proposed project, and producing evidence showing growth and work is what is scored in the class.
general 2022-09-15 03:00:04 that includes the tail tho
general 2022-09-15 03:00:18 isnt the vert stab like 1/2 of the height
general 2022-09-15 03:01:53 5 blocks tall 16 blocks long
general 2022-09-15 03:01:59 so if it were 10 blocks tall
general 2022-09-15 03:02:05 it would be 32 blocks long
general 2022-09-15 03:02:35 "Length: 52 ft 11 in (16.13 m)"
"Height: 16 ft 4 in (4.98 m)"
general 2022-09-15 03:02:57 roscale would be 6.5 blocks tall
general 2022-09-15 03:03:18 and 21 blocks long
general 2022-09-15 03:03:26 thats plane crazy's fault ngl
general 2022-09-15 03:03:40 roscale being bad is kinda the games fault
general 2022-09-15 03:03:54 yea
general 2022-09-15 03:04:14 the way the game is made makes it so small things can be as detailed as large things
general 2022-09-15 03:05:10 which one is b-25
general 2022-09-15 03:06:05 omg 747-8i same length as su-27?? real?
general 2022-09-15 03:06:39 little man tried 😢

help 2022-09-30 04:39:14 that would only get to 4 blocks minimum
help 2022-09-30 04:54:48 its not
help 2022-09-30 04:54:52 its not 1 wide tho
help 2022-10-01 20:34:09 Never use motor 1 for control surfaces, maybe for trim but nothing else
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:38:22 Finally a build that doesn’t use cutters for the era
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:39:41 Dang I guess I’ll never see one then
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:40:13 Wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:40:17 Angled wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:40:33 Or disconnector bases
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:41:04 Isn’t the inside part supposed to be hollow tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:42:11 Bru ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:42:22 It just adds more detail
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 20:43:53 It’s like making a wheel out of wedges instead of a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 19:49:02 New train wheels coming soon!
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 19:50:04 
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:17:33 
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:18:02 thrust vectoring is actually so ass to make in pc
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:18:23 because move planes just have a bunch of hovers stacked in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:18:31 and u cant rlly turn those
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:19:41 thrust vectoring is basically redirecting the exhaust from the engine to produce a force to rotate the plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:19:57 which is impossible in pc
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:20:40 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:20:50 not realistically, no
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:21:11 ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:21:17 turning the engine doesnt count
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:21:38 thats not how thrust vectoring works tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:21:45 its not a thruster that rotates
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:22:00 its a fixed engine that redirects the thrust using the nozzle
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:22:10 its not supposed to be in-game either
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:22:16 its literally a glitch
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:22:40 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:22:46 he hasnt fixed any of the glitch engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:23:14 does take up a considerable amount of space and blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:23:47 literally the only thing they got going for them is the high speed/acceleration
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:24:06 why use hover drives if you can just use a more powerful engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:24:22 instead of the weak ass engines in game (the non-glitch ones)
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:24:53 basically with the power of a hover drive but an actual engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:25:07 how are they not adequate at their job?
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:25:33 add more powerful engines.
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:25:48 i cant read
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:26:36 replace hover engine with an actual engine that is just as powerful
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:26:50 cuz super rocket engine is weak
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:27:34 ok u used so many pronouns in ur sentence i dont even know what the antecedent is
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:27:42 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:28:20 yea...
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:28:43 yesnt
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:29:40 hover engine wont work anymore so the new engine will basically replace it and be better
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:30:23 i was explaining my idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:30:28 sorry if i worded it badl
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:31:22 itll be better tho cuz reduced block count, and better performance cuz configurable
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:32:06 new engine should be more power in a smaller more compact package
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:32:15 more bang
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:32:26 more bang for the block
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:32:49 again, thats a glitch engine, looks bad, and its glitchy
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:33:04 pvp was never balanced
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:33:31 ??? i never said that????
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:33:46 and arent rocket engines already being revamped?
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:33:50 in pc2?
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:34:00 all the engines actually
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:40:39 is it just my planes that roll at least slightly when using the rudder to yaw?
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:41:14 no not really, its just bad balancing...
and also pc physics
bot-central 2022-10-03 01:41:20 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:41:43 yea i had to put tiny control surfaces in my wing to counter it
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:42:37 would be nice if i could use my ailerons as toggleable flaps for landing
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:44:24 wdym by that
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:44:57 how
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:45:04 how do u assign multiple

plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:45:17 bru
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:45:18 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:45:45 i use full keyboard, mouse for flaps
so my plane is super sensitive
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:45:57 like if you stand on the nose while im flying
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:46:05 my plane will slowly starts to pitch down
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:46:19 and if you stand on the back itll pitch up
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:46:41 i used 1 single prop engine to boost pitch up speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:46:44 nothing else
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 01:51:44 G force limit when
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 02:07:42 fun fact: its kinda hard to make/test a plane have neutral static stability if you use mouse control

plane-crazy 2022-10-03 02:22:36 canards look weird compared to the wing and elevator shape
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 02:44:37 dayum
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 14:44:02 Would be nice if keyboard controlled planes didn’t get more sensitive at higher speeds, like fly-by-wire but for keyboard
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 14:45:20 How do planes like this have wingtip lights
creations-chat 2022-10-07 01:52:41 jesus how do u see back
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:25:35 remaking old jet, taller motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:27:44 should i make it longer or shorter or keep the same length?
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:28:20 im gonna make the nose thinner
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:28:34 bro im not even at that part yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:28:36 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:28:46 also
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:29:04 the most of the exposed lock is just cuz my tower wasnt tall enough
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:32:08 mm yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:33:01 sort of based off this
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:33:15 basically just the size and wing layout
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:33:19 everything else isnt
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:33:24 nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:33:57 i dont like camo patterns in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:37:01 this is like 1.5 wide right
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:38:48 why does my nose look so thick even tho its 2 wide
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:39:39 also the intakes are so far forward on mine
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:44:18 anyone know how i can lock this back slightly so that i doesnt stick out and collide with my canards?
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:44:38

plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:47:40 something like that
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:47:55 keep the same basic shape but make improvements wherever I can
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:48:06 decrease block count and complexity
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:49:24 i want a half-bubble canopy
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:49:37 like the front is a cylinder or pontoon
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:49:44 but the middle isnt
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:49:57 because idk how to get out of a bubble canopy in pc
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:50:01 if its cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:50:33 is there any way for the piston to lock back?
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:50:40 or does it only go forwards
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 02:51:09 because the canard wont work with the piece sticking out slightly

plane-crazy 2022-10-09 02:14:05 pc is being so slow today
general 2022-10-09 02:17:57 they literally just copied the design of the f-35 and gave it 2 engines because their engines are too weak to only put 1
general 2022-10-09 02:19:31 no redundancy with 2 engines, pain to maintain because the engine is so high up
general 2022-10-09 02:21:34 high wing with no anhedral angle means worse maneuverability, also has terrible pitch control which makes it turn even slower
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 17:56:39 please elaborate

plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:32:44 make the upper half lighter, make the lower half heavier, if there are wing panels in the upper half, remove them, add vertical wing panels to the lower half
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:33:11 its kinda simple  ngl

plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:34:07 wdym by in depth
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:34:12 theres no depth to it
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:36:22 theres inertia as in heavier things are harder to more, theres no advanced aerodynamics, idk what you mean by advanced friction, but fabric has higher friction and ice has lower friction
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:37:09 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:37:25 only some blocks have air resistance

plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:41:26 so idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:43:52 bruh it is
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:45:11 literally just a variant
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:52:04 no, and thats bad example because with those, the airframe is different
the CF-18A is essentially just a base F-18A with upgraded avionics and a few minor changes
this is why I wouldnt consider the super hornet to be the same as the hornet, or the strike eagle to be the same as the base eagle
if you showed an image of the 747-8 and called it the 747, i'd be fine, because the 747 is kinda just the general way to refer to most 747 variants
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:52:43 747-400 is a 747, 747-8 is not a 747-400
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 01:56:06 CF-18A is an F/A-18, EA-18G is not an F/A-18E

plane-crazy 2022-11-05 18:11:56 
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 18:13:27 the trim tab itself does not have a noticeable effect on attitude, but what it does is it pushes the elevator in the opposite direction which changes attitude
plane-crazy 2022-11-05 18:14:11 and its sort of hard to do that in plane crazy, because of how small it is and the elevators wouldnt move from the trim tab

events-chat 2022-11-11 23:11:23 how do u guys know the motor torque
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:11:35 and how do u know if we are stacking them or not
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:19:59 i kinda have to stack motors so that i can steer
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:20:17 one motor to move and one to steer

events-chat 2022-11-11 23:32:10 i can go on saturday
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:50:39 fun fact, even though motor torque is limited to 5, you can use a reduction gear to increase torque
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:56:43 also since you have to be able to get off the tracks, use a large wheelbase and large wheels if ur using wheels.
large wheelbase reducing manuverability but you dont need that anyways
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:04:45 bruh remove this rule
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:05:00 suspensions and pistons are useful
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:13:50 its usefull for spinners
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:27:23 
events-chat 2022-11-12 00:45:59 and my weapons are retraactable so i need pistons
events-chat 2022-11-12 03:35:05 ?
events-chat 2022-11-12 03:47:23 is a propeller blade not just a turned wing panel
events-chat 2022-11-12 03:47:28 and wing panels are allowed

plane-crazy 2022-11-12 05:02:57 what does the powered setting on disconnectors do
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:26:51 <@466793357318815744> can I stack 2 motors with torque 5 for wheels? since it adds up to 10
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:27:43 why do u need a hammer  tho its not gonna crush anything
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:30:39 cheese grater
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:31:35 does anyone know if this is okay
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:45 yea but the total torque doesnt exceed the limit
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:20 bruh no one told me there was no torque limit for wheels
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:48 its not a robot lmao
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:58 its called battlebots but they arent actual robots
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:09 combat vehicles???
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:50 torque rule seems fine to me
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:11 flippers can use pistons, suspensions, and springs

events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:48 rbk can you clarify in <#621452102618578964> that theres no torque limit for drive motors?
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:40 its an event in a lego game, its meant to be fun, so there are rules
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:45 its really that shrimple
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:37 theres a reason why drag races have power limits
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:56 im like 99% sure that most do
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:23:28 and teams have tried that, which is the reason why theres a power limit
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:24:01 smooth wheels when
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:24:14 with actual tire pressure
general 2022-11-12 20:28:34 why are packaged/bagged french fries not a thing
general 2022-11-12 20:28:46 you could keep them crispy the same way as potato chips
general 2022-11-12 20:29:15 wdym
general 2022-11-12 20:29:31 same way potato chips stay crispy
general 2022-11-12 20:29:42 theres like some gas in the bag that keeps it fresh
general 2022-11-12 20:29:51 so it doesnt get soggy
general 2022-11-12 20:32:42 dont need to
general 2022-11-12 20:32:48 as long as its crispy
general 2022-11-12 20:32:56 it wont be ice cold since its room temp
general 2022-11-12 20:32:59 like chips
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:50 wider wheels are better right
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:53 more grip
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:34:57 less slip

general 2022-11-13 01:28:20 why does a paper airplane not break if it crashes, but a real plane does
general 2022-11-13 01:28:29 seems like discriminaiton to me
general 2022-11-13 01:28:40 fr
general 2022-11-13 01:28:55 no ammo
general 2022-11-13 01:29:11 what
general 2022-11-13 01:31:02 if both planes were equiped with fly-by-wire systems, im 99% sure the crash wouldnt have happened
general 2022-11-13 01:31:25 the plane
general 2022-11-13 01:31:43 well no since they didnt have fly-by-wire
general 2022-11-13 01:31:46 i think
general 2022-11-13 01:33:06 fr
general 2022-11-13 01:33:28 still viable for safety reasons
general 2022-11-13 01:33:41 especially on that large of a plane
general 2022-11-13 01:34:28 i feel like all planes above a certain speed or size limit should be required to have fly-by-wire

plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:20:47 
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:38:11 if you make a bot small enough, you can just hide here and the bigger bots will have a harder time getting you
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:41:12 fun fact, if you set gravity to 300, you can increase your weight without increase your mass
events-chat 2022-11-13 05:25:06 this might take a while
events-chat 2022-11-13 05:25:21 ill need to configure 64 different motors
general 2022-11-13 06:23:12 1 block is 0.7 meters right
events-chat 2022-11-13 17:58:28 please unban suspension
events-chat 2022-11-13 17:58:36 the ground is actually so damn bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:01:19 its especially noticeable at high speeds
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:04:00 how do i make suspension without using the banned blocks
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:06:38 im confused now since it says we can fold outside of the limit
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:07:39 i know but i need suspension for wheels
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:07:55 my bot will literally jump over the rails from the bumpiness
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:31 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:46 yea
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:15 i havent seen any wedge bots
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:21 which is interesting
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:37 its not glitching out
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:45 its just hitting the tiny bumps on the field
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:49 and jumping up
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:08 well yea cuz ur slow
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:11 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:33 what even is the point of banning suspension tho
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:56 well only 1 of the motors is used for forward/reverse
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:03 the only one is for turning
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:10 and the lone motor is unpowered
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:31 yes?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:43 i need redundacy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:57 evading
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:08 and possibly ramming into enemies
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:13 to send them flying
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:44 it makes the controls difficult
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:12:54 you have to use 2 hands to drive
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:24 if i increase my mass a ton (which the wheels can handle), i probably wont
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:29 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:39 if you call it something different
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:44 how would i know what it is
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:21:35 pc2 is a lie
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:47:46 its not completely flat
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:47:55 its bumpy enough to make my bot jump
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:34 i have 32 big 5x5 wheels
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:41 each wheel is 4 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:49 max speed and torque
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:49:56 so yea its gonna be bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:08 so i need some sort of suspension to smooth it out
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:27 yes
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:44 it is quite the big
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:50:54 yea please
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:07 why would u use suspension for weapons anyways
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:13 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:19 its all fuel beams
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:51:49 suspension is literally designed to be used for drive systems
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:52:22 is a magnet cannon a glitch
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:52:51 aint n oway
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:11 whats with the 51x51 size limit but folding outside the limit is allowed
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:41 true
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:53:58 smol boat
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:55:59 in the meantime, how do i make wheel suspension without using suspension blocks
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:12 im surprised u have no top armor
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:29 a javelin could easily blow that whole thing up
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:56:53 fun fact, your character is a weak point
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:08 so you should place the main pilot seat in the most armored position
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:35 ok because those 5 torque motors are able to fling a 500 ton battle bot
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:57:41 somehow
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:15 i wanna copy u so bad
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:33 except bigger and buffer
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:58:50 im gonna fold my bot so its bigger than the plot
creations-chat 2022-11-13 19:26:37 guh
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:48:45 isnt 2 beams more than 6 blocks tho
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:56:15 i never knew there was an expert server
events-chat 2022-11-13 22:08:44 <@466793357318815744> can i put max torque for a motor used for folding? it wont be moved during the match since its a locked motor
events-chat 2022-11-14 02:02:55 me
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:17:04 DANG thats huge
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:17:09 jeeez
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:31 man most of ur wheels dont even do anything
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:46 tf u mean
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:20:54 the ones on top dont do shit
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:03 at least mine all function
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:22 yes thats my point
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:21:27 thats the goal of my bot
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:19 <@466793357318815744> does the bot have to be above ground?
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:44 man u didnt specify
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:24:58 like underground bots
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:22 it like
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:26 is under the ground
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:25:55 ok
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:27:03 yes but ur gonna get ripped apart
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:27:07 so uh good luck
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:28:31 man that dont look like a pentagram
events-chat 2022-11-14 04:29:28 penta means five, nowhere in that is 5

events-chat 2022-11-15 03:08:52 <@466793357318815744> my bots top speed on flat ground is 310, in the arena its 280 ish, acceleration also suffers in the arena
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:42:21 so uh yea i need suspension
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:40 literally
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:58 dude its literally bumpy
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:57:19 for the most part, no, since you wont be going fast enough to notice
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:39 its not just my bot tho, i saw another dudes bot also glitching, albeit not as much
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:55 its a combination of high speed and no suspension
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:59:19 no because then that wouldnt be the max motor settings
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:59:54 if the maximum motor speed is 50 and max torque is 1000, then you can fairly assume that the game is designed to handle that power
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:03 roblox is just ass
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:37 the reason its glitching is probably because of the amount of motors in it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:59 yes
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:01:09 im not giving up the motors tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:01:25 it doesnt glitch on my end so i honestly dont really  care
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:05 i mean i get launched too
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:11 its not a unique problem
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:44 why would it fix it tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:16 okay but that also means i wont be able to push other bots
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:50 which have reduced torque compared to smaller wheels
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:00 each is 4 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:32 
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:26 and my bot still takes 3 full seconds to do a 360 turn
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:25 its not possible for me to ever get to that tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:33 because of the way the bindings are set up
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:42 the total torque is only going to be 32k
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:26:24 on flat ground, probably 80% at least
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:25 so you know how when you have a motor at max torque and 50 speed, itll instantly spin at max speed when you push the key right? well my wheels dont
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:35 nah what
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:38 how
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:59 im going 300+ speed on flat ground in this heavy ass bot
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:19 no
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:38 why would i lock it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:09 locked motors dont stay locked when ur moving it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:23 yes
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:30 oh wiat
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:36 maybe i should lock them
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:48 locked motors act weird tho
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:53:11 yousurf made a spinner bot that can fling my plot sized monstrosity with 200k fuel, at like 2k speed
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:53:26 and somehow the motor torque is 5 and speed is 40
events-chat 2022-11-15 05:08:51 same thing lma
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 05:42:42 this looks like a pain to work on
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 05:47:08 i mean anyone can use a mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-11-15 05:48:20 copying builds isnt against the rules either
creations-chat 2022-11-15 05:50:48 literally the same aside from slightly bigger wing

events-chat 2022-11-16 03:55:24 my hammer is set to 10 torque and it literally cannot move
events-chat 2022-11-16 03:56:13 and its super buggy now
bug-reports 2022-11-18 06:03:54 my autosave slot is not loading in when i join the game

creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:48:43 they are just as capable for the role they were designed for and are used for
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:52:46 mig29s are not flankers
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:55:21 the nato reporting name given to the su-27 is Flanker, the nato reporting name given to the mig-29 is the Fulcrum, so no, the mig-29 is not a Flanker

events-chat 2022-11-24 22:32:53 apparently its the shape of the blade or weight distribution or something

bug-reports 2022-11-26 19:41:13 u mean a tail rotor?
bug-reports 2022-11-26 19:42:39 ok but a swashplate doesnt do anything for that
bug-reports 2022-11-26 19:47:22 swashplate does not control yaw in single rotor helis
general 2022-11-27 02:14:34 looks ok
general 2022-11-27 02:15:42 i mean that looks like effort to me
contest-chat 2022-11-27 02:19:44 <@1004207882784489472> how do those tiny rotors produce enough lift
contest-chat 2022-11-27 02:20:30 this does not look functional
contest-chat 2022-11-27 02:20:49 im assuming u have a functional rotor hidden inside the build?

general 2022-11-28 04:03:44 avionics update when
general 2022-11-28 04:03:56 (advanced) fly by wire in pc2????
general 2022-11-28 04:04:25 fr
general 2022-11-28 04:04:48 the lift to drag ratio of the wings are awful
general 2022-11-28 04:05:57 that does increase the lift to drag ratio tho
general 2022-11-28 04:06:30 making a wing out of disconnectors is only good for high speed planes
general 2022-11-28 04:08:51 lower wing area means higher wing loading which is only really viable for high speed aircraft
general 2022-11-29 04:17:10 one on the left is "Green" colored red, one on the right is "Red" colored green
general 2022-11-29 04:17:52 <@696851246325432321> are u french
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:21:57 ive been stuck on this idk how to make better
im thinking about making intakes wider at the front but i dont want it to look fat
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 04:23:26 i want to make the intakes wider but i also dont want it to look fat
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:25:12 i honestly dont know what to do aside from cleaning up some gaps and bits
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:27:59 forgot to say but its supposed to be something around the size of a gripen or hal tejas
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:31:46 🤷‍♂️ V3 on top V2 on bottom, V2 nose just looks fat
<@883063424614006878> gripen is like 1 block longer
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:39:08 der a bit different
creations-chat 2022-11-29 04:47:47 i think the size is okay, i need to figure out how to angle the cockpit and raise the pilot seat slightly
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:00:34 1.8 wide at the base, 1 wide at the tip
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:07:30 i dont want to make any significant increases in size, im willing to lengthen it by a few blocks maybe, but i cant make any drastic changes like making the fuselage any more than 3.5 blocks wide (including intakes), so the wider i make the cockpit, the smaller the intakes
creations-chat 2022-11-29 05:15:12 now that i think about it, im basically going for a downsized f-35 with 2 engines and canards
help 2022-11-30 02:01:49 i want a nozzle like this that is 1.5 wide
help 2022-11-30 02:01:53 but idk if its possible
contest-chat 2022-11-30 02:35:55 if fake rotors are allowed then im sure it doesnt need to be able to fly
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:31:41 nose looks goofy
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:26 
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:43 looks like blobs
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:52 ok true this one is excusable
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:39:01 the glass sphere also looks sort of weird
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:41:44 
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:44:47 overall the build is ok, but sharp corners/edges on a blackhawk arent ideal
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:54 does the HH-60A have the sensors or no?
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:01 these things
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:47:00 bob, your rotor blades are angled the wrong way i thinke
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:48:04 the tips
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:49:39 main gear should be forward just a tad bit
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:51:28 ok
contest-chat 2022-11-30 22:36:44 next time, just make them delete and rebuild it
contest-chat 2022-11-30 22:36:55 that way its fair

plane-crazy 2022-11-30 22:40:23 how do i make this suspension
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:07:37 i cant figure out how
creations-chat 2022-11-30 23:11:10 F-22 is obviously a tanker
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:43:27 wait i didnt know u could do that
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:43:33 to limit the angle
plane-crazy 2022-11-30 23:51:02 because no one uses 0 torque
creations-chat 2022-12-01 00:37:29 actual rocker bogie with differential bar, i searched in pcc but none of them were true rocker bogies (except for maybe one but i dont think it is either)
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 00:39:53 bad rocker bogie
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 00:40:02 true rocker bogie

help 2022-12-01 19:09:49 
creations-chat 2022-12-01 19:11:32 2.5 blocks long
general 2022-12-01 19:13:40 ai better
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:16:09 why are the wheels in the middle lower
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:16:28 move the wheels in the middle up
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:16:54 or the wheels on the ends down
help 2022-12-01 19:22:41 ok i think i figured out the cause
help 2022-12-01 19:23:06 when turning in reverse, the inner rear wheel lifts
help 2022-12-01 19:23:25 i think i need a speed differential
help 2022-12-01 19:24:15 i could also set the center wheels to be unpowered, but then i get reduced power
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:28:38 i need a reliable speed differential to keep the wheels on the ground
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:29:54 a temporary fix I made is I made the center wheels unpowered, but that severely reduces power and climing ability
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:46:27 you can push down on the body with as much force as you want, and it will always maintain relatively equal ground pressure on each wheel, and the body wont go down
plane-crazy 2022-12-01 19:46:55 tis very good
general 2022-12-01 21:08:03 how do u get the cardboard to bend smoothly
general 2022-12-01 21:08:10 instead of creasing
general 2022-12-01 21:09:09 do they glide?
general 2022-12-01 21:09:52 i mean it seems like it could
general 2022-12-01 21:10:03 wdym
general 2022-12-01 21:10:55 they dont look too thick, and cardboard doesnt have high skin friction
general 2022-12-01 21:11:12 isnt cardboard like pretty lightweight
general 2022-12-01 21:11:41 is it cardboard with a layer of paper coating it
general 2022-12-01 21:12:00 gliders dont need control
general 2022-12-01 21:13:01 well yea cardboard is basically paper too
general 2022-12-01 21:13:21 yea you dont need control surfaces to be stable
general 2022-12-01 21:14:45 with the strength of the cardboard, you could make the wings larger, and they wouldnt flex much
general 2022-12-01 21:15:12 an aircraft does not need control surfaces to glide
general 2022-12-01 21:16:01 any glider lma
general 2022-12-01 21:16:40 yes??
general 2022-12-01 21:17:04 it doesnt need control surfaces to glide
general 2022-12-01 21:17:32 if you took the control surfaces off it would still glide as long as its balanced
general 2022-12-01 21:17:51 bro what? its simple physics
general 2022-12-01 21:18:27 no, no you dont
general 2022-12-01 21:22:29 control surfaces are not needed for an aircraft to be stable and balanced

contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:41:36 <@866848584888877077> its not too late to tell SR to restart his heli
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:43:02 is not
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:43:28 just tell him to delete the part that he did before the contest
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:43:42 everything he made after the contest started he can keep
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:43:57 so it only took him 2 days to make the build?
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:44:02 and contest still has 5 days
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:09 if he made 80% of his heli before the contest started and finished the rest after the contest started, then he should delete that 80% and rebuild it
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:16 the other 20% he can keep
contest-chat 2022-12-02 00:45:25 really is quite the simple

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:29:33 <@503262853420154920> torque
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:32:06 thats how wheels work
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:35:18 make a transmission then
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:38:44 having both a torque setting and an accelerate setting would be a mess
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:40:19 basically it would make it so you have the same amount of torque going 5 speed as going 50 speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:41:56 what
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:42:12 thats how torque works irl too
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:42:17 nothing complex
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:42:41 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:44:24 it is
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:44:30 in pc it is
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:44:38 without a transmission at least
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:45:02 i didnt name it
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:45:08 but its fixed
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:45:38 speed of the motor on the other hand, is not fixed
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:47:06 if u set it to a low torque it takes time to speed up
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:47:44 which is not how cars work but it accelerates
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:50:02 pc2 is a lie
general 2022-12-04 00:52:46 um im pretty sure who ur attracted to is not the same as ur gender
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:25:38 you could make one by setting the front wheels to have high speed low torque, and the rear wheels to be low speed high torque, but youd need a way to unpower the other motor or else itll slip
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:48:45 manual drive thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:49:06 rear motors have high torque, front motors have high speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:49:22 and the pistons engage with the motors

motors are fully unpowered when disengaged, so the car can cruise for quite a bit
works most effectively when only one set of motors is active
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 01:57:25 when the trails are spinning, it means the motor is disengaged, when the trails arent spinning it means the motors are engaged
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:01:54 https://streamable.com/t78fit better showcase of cruise performance
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:02:23 it slows down only because unpowered motors in pc still have friction

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:52 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:03:58 is the piston getting pushed in?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:04 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:30 still works for me
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:36 then its not locked
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:04:49 you need to wait a few seconds for the piston to lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:09 what
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 02:05:14 wdym

plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:32:54 there were 2 AoA sensors?
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:33:16 and both of them were recording the same data
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:33:30 that dont seem right
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:34:17 for the mcas to kick in wrongly with 2 sensors, youd need both to fail
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:34:25 im pretty sure there was only 1 sensor
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:34:30 and the 1 sensor failed
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:35:27 if 1 sensor has a fail rate of 1/10,000

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 21:25:56 if u want it to be detailed it would have to be even bigger
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 21:26:30 ok but you understand it is way harder to fit detail into a smaller size
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 21:37:16 the right half of the b-21 size

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 23:04:53 the wings are not thick enough but theres no 1x5 delta wing so i dont really care

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 23:30:36 but then its like way more when spawned in

general 2022-12-18 23:17:44 shit looks so fat bruh
general 2022-12-18 23:18:07 does not look viable in any way
general 2022-12-18 23:18:36 he said its a vertibird wdym
general 2022-12-18 23:19:09 ok? but its still going to be a vertibird
general 2022-12-18 23:19:44 the fact that hes still working on it does not change the fact that its going to eventually be a vertibird
general 2022-12-18 23:20:03 it still wont look viable
general 2022-12-18 23:20:32 even once its fully finished, its still gonna look like a vertibird which does not look viable in any way
general 2022-12-18 23:22:13 yes, i know its supposed to be for a video game, but that does not excuse the fact that its fat af and doesnt look like itd work at all
general 2022-12-18 23:22:51 im so confused
general 2022-12-18 23:22:57 its from a video game
general 2022-12-18 23:23:38 nah what
general 2022-12-18 23:23:41 when did it say that
general 2022-12-18 23:24:06 nah i just said the vertibird doesnt look viable
general 2022-12-18 23:25:01 what
general 2022-12-18 23:25:09 because it doesnt look viable?
general 2022-12-18 23:25:54 what
general 2022-12-18 23:26:40 relative to more modern aircraft, maybe, but it has historical value
general 2022-12-18 23:26:54 but a random fat thing from a video game has no value
general 2022-12-18 23:27:08 still has more value than a vertibird
general 2022-12-18 23:27:25 deserves to exist more than that vertibird thing
general 2022-12-18 23:27:40 t'is fact
general 2022-12-18 23:27:59 every mistake is a learning opportunity
general 2022-12-18 23:28:56 every fixed wing aircraft is basically just a wright flyer
general 2022-12-18 23:30:02 literally does not work for anything tho, it doesnt need to be able to fight in a combat zone
general 2022-12-18 23:30:19 the whole premise of the design would just be horribly inneffective
general 2022-12-18 23:30:40 although the f-14 is terrible, at least they had a reason for the swing wing design
general 2022-12-18 23:31:04 what
general 2022-12-18 23:31:18 what did i fail on
general 2022-12-18 23:31:51 nah my whole point is that its not viable
general 2022-12-18 23:32:06 hey buddy
general 2022-12-18 23:33:04 i presented my point, supported it with reasoning, and evidence is readily available information
general 2022-12-18 23:34:24 literally needs to at least be able to fly somewhat effectively comparable to a similar aircraft
general 2022-12-18 23:34:55 the main inspiration appears to be a tiltrotor like the v-22
general 2022-12-18 23:35:24 so itd have to be about as effective/efficient as the v-22
general 2022-12-18 23:37:04 at least comparably good
general 2022-12-18 23:37:32 pc2 hopefully will be better
general 2022-12-18 23:37:50 bru
general 2022-12-18 23:38:20 online arguments be like:
general 2022-12-18 23:39:21 it at least has to look like it would perform as good
general 2022-12-18 23:40:01 vertibird from fallout
general 2022-12-18 23:40:20 not going to talk about plane crazy right now bc fallout
general 2022-12-18 23:41:39 in the same way, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAIO_Qaher-313 this plane just looks like it wouldnt work
general 2022-12-18 23:43:38 if it looks like it wouldnt work well, it probably wouldnt work well unless theres some black magic
general 2022-12-18 23:43:55 like yea, the f-35 looks ugly to some ppl, but at least it looks like it can fly
general 2022-12-18 23:45:27 what
general 2022-12-18 23:45:58 i saw some guys vertibird build, searched up the vertibird on google, and observed that the vertibird looks like it would not work
general 2022-12-18 23:46:05 quite simple
general 2022-12-18 23:47:14 no, but the bare minimum is that it should at least look like it could work
general 2022-12-18 23:47:59 for example, lets take the su-75, who knows if it'll work, it hasnt been built, but at least from the mockup, it looks like it could have a chancehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-75_Checkmate
general 2022-12-18 23:48:21 at least for now, yes
general 2022-12-18 23:48:32 ok
general 2022-12-18 23:48:56 nah what
general 2022-12-18 23:53:44 youd need a way more powerful engine with larger rotors, or the fuselage would need to be made of paper, and those tiny wings wont wont provide enough lift to be meaningful
general 2022-12-18 23:53:57 and the fuselage being that shape would also create a ton of drag
general 2022-12-18 23:54:31 just look at any modern tiltrotor, the rotor and wing to fuselage ratio is vastly different
general 2022-12-19 03:08:54 does anyone have a good way to counter adverse yaw aside from rudder and directional stability?
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 03:17:12 how to counter adverse yaw

general 2022-12-20 04:11:17 i did
general 2022-12-20 04:11:44 what
general 2022-12-20 04:12:35 if someone started asking me to prove my age and i left that doesnt mean im underage lmao
general 2022-12-20 04:13:17 and how tf is anyone supposed to prove their age anyway
general 2022-12-20 04:13:46 the what
general 2022-12-20 04:13:54 yea
general 2022-12-20 04:14:15 personally i would not be comfortable sharing my birthdate to some random ppl on the internet
general 2022-12-20 04:14:37 vc checks???
general 2022-12-20 04:15:07 yea i dont see how u can accurately tell someones age from that
general 2022-12-20 04:15:32 if you dont have a confession or solid evidence that someone is underage, dont assume they're underage
general 2022-12-20 04:16:02 if you cant find any evidence to prove someone is underage, discord cant either
general 2022-12-20 04:16:35 yea thats just dumb
general 2022-12-20 04:17:32 bru
general 2022-12-20 04:18:14 nah but think about the worst case scenario
general 2022-12-20 04:19:48 of the ways that tech mentioned all of them are easily spoofed
general 2022-12-20 04:20:20 you can sound 12 and be 13, you can be behind in school, you can have your roblox birthdate be like 2021 or something
general 2022-12-20 04:20:59 if you're dumb enough to not be able to prove that you are indeed the age you claim to be
general 2022-12-20 04:21:38 nah what 💀
general 2022-12-20 04:21:56 💀
general 2022-12-20 04:22:55 dumb does not mean irresponsible
general 2022-12-20 04:23:14 nah but what if you cant pass any but you arent an unde
general 2022-12-20 04:23:44 thats entirely subjective but ok
general 2022-12-20 04:24:12 you can be behind in school, you can sound 11 even if ur like 14 or something
general 2022-12-20 04:25:09 ah yes i love baseless claims
general 2022-12-20 04:25:48 im like 100% sure i didnt
general 2022-12-20 04:26:41 yea they gotta provide their death certificate to prove they arent 10 💀

plane-crazy 2022-12-20 05:10:35 who ping
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:36:52 woscale!!
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:38:25 v-280
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:38:42 well eventually itll be
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:38:47 but its like 2 blocks rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:40:03 better osprey
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:40:12 different role but better design
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:40:55 how do i make the rotors stay in sync with each other
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:41:06 i wanna connect them with a driveshaft but idk how to do that
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:41:50 its like a bar that runs down the length
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:41:57 you spin one side
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:42:00 other side spins too
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:42:21 i am using motors bru
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:42:26 but they wont stay in sync
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:42:33 nah but there is
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:42:57 like
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:43:04 you spin one rotor 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:43:09 other one spins 90 degrees too
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:43:16 so they dont spin independently
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:43:28 rpm of both rotors is always the same
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:44:04 what
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:44:26 dunno what that is
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:44:30 what is thrust sweep
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:45:22 i mean thats probably also connected using some system but im talking about the actual rotors
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:45:33 like the thingys that spin very fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:46:02 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:46:07 because the rotors turn
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:46:23 see how they arent turned the same angle?
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:46:55 no, at least not for now
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:47:34 theoretically they should turn the same amount if the power is the same, but in practice, they wont be exactly in sync
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:48:15 you can see how both rotors are turned at the same exact angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:48:24 nah but i wanna make them in sync
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:48:35 irl they're linked with some sort of drive shaft
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:49:20 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:49:38 nah but i can
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:49:44 i will figure out a way
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:51:07 if i can make them in sync, id be able to run both rotors using a single engine/motor
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 21:51:16 which would be kinda cool ngl
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 23:15:47 this might work for a drive shaft
creations-chat 2022-12-21 00:26:03 sorry dude, i see the effort but you gotta make it smooth

creations-chat 2022-12-21 05:48:51 eh, the wings on the side are kinda thin but 4 wide is the best i can do tbh
creations-chat 2022-12-21 17:52:04 kinda messy rn but this bottom fuselage section basically
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:03:31 length and width should be ok, i might need to make it a bit taller or make the skin thinner
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:12:56 hmm
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:28:09 that man failed math or sum, its 23.5 blocks long
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:07:33 a block is not 0.78 meters
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:10:40 ok
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:12:57 link to the 5.1 feet
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:15:50 look at the source tho
a roblox character is 2 blocks tall, according to rickje, a block is 2.5 studs, making a character 5 studs tall, that source is wrong
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:17:56 thats not a roblox site tho
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:20:25 5 studs tall
even though its amazon, its not an official amazon answer, its like a forum, anyone can answer
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:23:46 i think the assumption that a character is 5.5 studs tall created the discrepancy
0.7 meters = 1 block in length
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:26:23 i think ill be able to fit 1 bomb long

general 2023-01-03 01:33:50 if its functional then show us

general 2023-01-03 01:34:22 i dont care if its done or not
general 2023-01-03 01:34:49 oh bruh thats dumb
general 2023-01-03 01:35:52 radar is supposed to have a range of at least like 50 miles bruh
general 2023-01-03 01:36:16 if its using hover engines, then its not radar??
general 2023-01-03 01:36:48 because radar uses electromagnetic waves
general 2023-01-03 01:37:04 its not a real radar, so dont call it one
general 2023-01-03 01:37:46 it is not possible to use electromagnetic waves in pc
general 2023-01-03 01:37:52 what
general 2023-01-03 01:38:20 what
general 2023-01-03 01:40:06 visible light in game does not function "realistically"
general 2023-01-03 01:40:20 it just make stuff brighter
general 2023-01-03 01:45:05 im like 99% sure the bot doesnt know shit
general 2023-01-03 01:45:23 you could make a new <13 account and the bot would say no information
general 2023-01-03 01:45:52 (radio waves are electromagnetic waves)
general 2023-01-03 01:46:24 yes
general 2023-01-03 01:46:35 nothing i said is wrong wdym
general 2023-01-03 01:46:44 just cuz ur right doesnt make me wrong
general 2023-01-03 01:46:55 ok
general 2023-01-03 01:48:02 2 wide 777-9
general 2023-01-03 01:49:16 hell nah thats not radar
general 2023-01-03 01:53:50 what do u want bruh
general 2023-01-03 01:55:30 thats my point 💀 wdym
general 2023-01-03 01:58:29 <@1004207882784489472> literally isnt possible
general 2023-01-03 01:59:03 say all of what
general 2023-01-03 01:59:20 all i said is that his "radar" isnt radar
general 2023-01-03 01:59:55 he literally said its functional
general 2023-01-03 02:01:50 bruh can u like not
general 2023-01-03 02:03:16 not actual matter
general 2023-01-03 02:08:50 im pretty sure that just means a higher lift-drag ratio, cuz wings in pc alredy have lift
general 2023-01-03 02:09:23 planes in pc can technically glide but just with a shitty glide ratio bc of a low lift-drag ratio
general 2023-01-03 02:09:33 explain helicopters
general 2023-01-03 02:09:53 which creates lift
general 2023-01-03 02:10:31 pls source
general 2023-01-03 02:10:40 what is this "pseudo lift" you speak of
general 2023-01-03 02:11:30 wings in pc make plane go up too wdym
general 2023-01-03 02:12:21 wings in pc also work like actual wings 💀
general 2023-01-03 02:13:12 ok the shape could be improved but rectangle just easier to model
general 2023-01-03 02:13:36 the one on the right
general 2023-01-03 02:14:53 not unless the AoA is increased, no
general 2023-01-03 02:15:27 like i said, it depends
general 2023-01-03 02:16:25 airfoil shape, in this case, the wing is a flat rectangle essentially just a piece of cardboard, which means its uncambered and will produce 0 lift when the AoA is 0
general 2023-01-03 02:16:57 wings in pc are functionally similar to symmetrical airfoils
general 2023-01-03 02:17:51 angled wings create both lift and drag
general 2023-01-03 02:19:27 yes
general 2023-01-03 02:19:51 no i think
general 2023-01-03 02:19:56 i think he means like a parachute
general 2023-01-03 02:20:03 like with no forward speed
general 2023-01-03 02:20:39 yes, large wings are gonna act like parachutes if ur falling straight down with no forward speed
general 2023-01-03 02:21:38 if you tilt them they do create lift
general 2023-01-03 02:22:26 there is
general 2023-01-03 02:23:14 idk but my car can cruise like the entire length of the plots without slowing down fully
general 2023-01-03 02:24:03 and if i were to add brakes, they wouldnt stop the car instantly either
general 2023-01-03 02:25:35 w h a t
general 2023-01-03 02:26:19 i thought we had already established that lift exists in pc
general 2023-01-03 02:27:21 oh shit im dyslexic i read that as "still i wouldnt say there is lift in pc
general 2023-01-03 02:32:32 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)#A_more_comprehensive_physical_explanation
general 2023-01-03 02:33:54 False explanation based on equal transit-time
The "equal transit time" explanation starts by arguing that the flow over the upper surface is faster than the flow over the lower surface because the path length over the upper surface is longer and must be traversed in equal transit time.[41][42][43] Bernoulli's principle states that under certain conditions increased flow speed is associated with reduced pressure. It is concluded that the reduced pressure over the upper surface results in upward lift.[44]

A serious flaw in the equal transit time explanation is that it does not correctly explain what causes the flow to speed up.[5] The longer-path-length explanation is simply wrong. No difference in path length is needed, and even when there is a difference, it is typically much too small to explain the observed speed difference.[45] This is because the assumption of equal transit time is wrong. There is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false.[46][47][48][49][50][51] In fact, the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts.[52] The much higher flow speed over the upper surface can be clearly seen in this animated flow visualization.
general 2023-01-03 02:35:49 idk but no one else provided a correct correction
general 2023-01-03 02:36:32 still wrong tho

general 2023-01-03 02:41:52 radars use radio waves, you did not make radio waves in plane crazy
general 2023-01-03 02:44:33 if you cant do something, it means its impossible, it does not mean it cant be possible
general 2023-01-03 02:45:01 i will hide a camera floating somewhere in the sky and you wont find it
general 2023-01-03 02:46:37 if theres air in the box, the engines will still produce thrust, but the box just wont move (i think)
general 2023-01-03 02:47:50 if you have radar and they dont, it means you can strike them and they wont know until its too late
general 2023-01-03 02:48:22 the range is probably like 5 blocks bruh
general 2023-01-03 02:48:40 in a realistic situation, you wont
general 2023-01-03 02:49:11 thats still nothing
general 2023-01-03 02:49:22 yes

general 2023-01-03 02:51:31 ok
general 2023-01-03 02:52:05 guess what? im not

general 2023-01-03 02:54:42 and?
general 2023-01-03 02:55:07 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 02:56:57 <@538169956735647745> this is his "radar"
general 2023-01-03 02:57:23 ok yea its not a real radar
general 2023-01-03 02:58:15 real radar also detects speed (i think)
general 2023-01-03 03:00:08 what
general 2023-01-03 03:01:35 even if it was true it only looks like it can track location, real radar has differently sized blip so a large plane would be a a larger blip, real radar also tracks speed and maybe altitude
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:03:32 i highly doubt it does
general 2023-01-03 03:04:55 im sorry but whats the point of using a radar if it only tracks the position of objects in like a 1 plot range
general 2023-01-03 03:11:20 but you already posted it saying you made it
general 2023-01-03 03:11:46 there would be no permanent damage from some random 8 year old copying you

creations-chat 2023-01-07 00:57:14 Would not consider these mini
creations-chat 2023-01-08 03:02:30 assuming u have no vertical wing panels, make sure the center of mass isnt behind of center of lift, for yaw control, just motorlock 2 control surface into each other, one deflects up and one deflects down to create extra drag on one side to yaw
hidden vertical wing panels will work but they create extra drag and are not needed
creations-chat 2023-01-08 03:08:20 what the hell is this
creations-chat 2023-01-08 03:11:30 average anime pfp user

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 03:17:14 modified tutorial
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:27:45 ok so the drift he was talking about is just adverse yaw
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:31:46 would it be possible for the vertical stabilizer of a commercial airliner to be completely eliminated and replace with fly by wire control using differential engines thrust combined with ailerons
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:32:41 this would bring a ton of benefits such as reducing drag and weight and maintenance cost and would reduce operating cost significantly
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:33:34 id assume itd be cheaper because thats a whole large thing u wouldnt need to build
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 04:34:11 and the addition of a bit of code to control yaw wouldnt add much cost
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:35:08 no cockpit, engines are flat, wing shape is relly weird
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:40:16 engine just doesnt look right, the ends of the wing arent supposed to be wider either
creations-chat 2023-01-08 04:52:15 i think the wingtips may look like they are wider but its just because of the angle, the actual wing chord stays the same
creations-chat 2023-01-08 20:09:11 how do i fill this in
creations-chat 2023-01-08 20:25:54 make it pointier

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 04:22:43 omg hyperrealistic
creations-chat 2023-01-09 04:26:40 literally looks so innaccurate when compared to the actual, it may look good on its own, but the innaccuracies can be seen when compared with the real one
creations-chat 2023-01-09 04:30:53 these are just some of the problems
creations-chat 2023-01-09 04:34:06 the f-117 is supposed to have very nice and clean defined edges, and his build just doesnt do it right
the edges on his build look poorly done and theres all kinds of gaps and stuff throughout the build
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:42:30 first of all, if ur referring to that, its an F-117, second of all, I only make builds I think will be interesting, so I choose want I want to build, although I am open to suggestions
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:46:32 eh, looks ugly and is kinda basic, nothing interesting/unique either aside from the old nose intake design which isnt really unique either, id rather build interesting planes
<@756829031982432276> i dont really like building old planes bc it just feels boring when i could be building new vehicles
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:49:50 i have no ideas on how I would make it have an interior, i cant just put a horn and add emojis
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:54:57 what block is the yellow piece for the throttle
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:57:06 why do i feel like theres a suspension or helium block somewhere

<@627546746792443904> you should make a mig-19
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 07:24:15 isnt that what russian jets use and isnt that like innefficient
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 07:26:02 its also smaller to just have up and down thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 07:26:09 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 07:27:15 yaw thrust vectoring is pretty useless for a well designed jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 07:27:44 obviously in the future with tailless jets, yaw thrust vectoring might become needed

creations-chat 2023-01-10 00:29:16 (Default jet engine)
help 2023-01-10 00:32:50 From what I’m seeing, the rudder is trying to yaw your plane to the right but is instead rolling it to the left due to the high rudder position, so it sort of acts like an aileron
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 00:36:15 What is a concertilery
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 00:36:22 Convertilery
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 00:39:30 Usually the nose gear is supposed to be smaller and the main gear is supposed to be bigger
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 00:40:17 Bcuz the main gear supports most of the weight, and the nose gear’s main purpose is for steering

creations-chat 2023-01-10 05:09:52 in order for an airliner in pc to be truly "roscale" the walls would have to be made of disconnectors or trapdoors or something similar
creations-chat 2023-01-10 05:12:49 taking the 777X for example, the wall is 4.5 inches thick on each side
creations-chat 2023-01-10 05:27:59 a roscale 777x would have a wingspan of almost exactly 102.5 blocks, which is just over 2 plots wide

creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:18:41 in plane crazy its nearly impossible
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:25:59 i was researching the possibility of building a roscale 777X in pc, the walls would have to be made of disconnectors or trapdoors, so you'd need a bunch of angle locks, and theres basically no space to hide the motorlock except for maybe in the nose or in the very back assuming i want actually usable cargo space, the seats in pc are also way to be for economy, 10-abreast economy seats on the 777X are 18 inches wide, a seat in pc is 27.5 inches wide, and even if you managed to get everything mentioned above, youd still have to make the cockpit which would be horrendous consider the blocks wouldnt line up if its a custom sized cylinder, and youd still have to somehow weasle in space to fit the landing gear with landing gear doors, and it would just be a nightmare to make
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:31:17 i didnt think about control surfaces but that seems like it would make a lot of drag
creations-chat 2023-01-11 06:34:58 ive never seen control surfaces used fro the fuselage, could you show me an example?

creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:33:50 dry the air
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:38:47 why is this random 0 lock bf109 better than mine
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:42:03 you got the order mixed up
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:45:10 
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:00:15 i will figure out how to remove the exposed motor without using magnetlock, its just as aerodynamic as every other pc build, and if you threw it into a wind tunnel it would fly bc it has wings dunno what u mean by turbulent foil, if you mean turbolent flow, that isnt a problem at low speeds, consider a paper airplane, idk what you mean by center of gravity bc it flies perfectly fine, WBL 183.4???, I will add exhaust exit later, the in-game prop engine is literally a piston engine, just a different type of piston engine (thats ricks fault im not doing his work for him), ahm ackshually its not a cube its a rectangular prism 🤓, and yea air is still gonna flow over it, air still flows over a box if you throw it, front landing gear is ricks fault as well
so your response is ass basically 💯
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:04:12 if you read the message, the only useful piece of info you gave me is the exhaust exit thingies
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:06:21 i literally have made improvements to it wdym
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:10:44 maybe it is, but its still better than the few roscale bf109s out there
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:13:01 thats literally not roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:15:22 theres literally only like 2 (maybe 3) roscale bf109s in pcc, and i didnt see any on youtube
<@398216801592410113> yea, because its not roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:17:59 its actually slightly larger than roscale lol
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:22:34 dude mine is like barely bigger its close enough

<@456226577798135808>
IRL BF109 specs:
12.786 blocks long
14.179 blocks wingspan
3.714 blocks tall
MY BF109 specs
13 blocks long
16 blocks wingspace
4 blocks tall (might be more idk)
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:24:43 <@456226577798135808> that guy is about the same height as the fuselage, if not slightly taller, my planes fuselage is 2 blocks tall, the same height as my character standing up
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:28:19 the only reason the arms are sticking out is because of roblox animations making the arms stick way out to the side, as you can see in your photo, the guys arms barely fit inside the plane, if he were to literally T-pose then he wouldnt fit in the plane either
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:31:00 sorry bro but this doesnt count as roscale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:35:07 my avatar is closer to a real human than a blocky style avatar is, a cat-sized cat avatar would be roscale to a real life cat
help 2023-01-15 03:36:37 canards and thrust vectoring both work
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:45:51 idk what definition ur using but 1 stud = 0.28 meters accoring to roblox, a block is 2.5 studs according to rickje, therefore a block is 0.7 meters, using simple arithmetic and wikipedia specifications, you can determine the amount of blocks a certain build needs to be sized to
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:48:51 <@773474989751664640> this is the definition im using
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 03:52:20 ppl saying arms sticking out the sides of a plane means it isnt roscale, but a block in pc is literally 27.5 inches wide
a first class seat on the 777 is only 21 inches wide, a regal cinemas movie theater seat is 25 inches wide
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:05:37 very detailed
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:34:45 stud to irl ratio doesnt change
the avatar you use doesnt change build scale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:37:59 that doesnt change the fact that a block in pc is equivalent to 0.7 meters irl
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:40:15 <@690957737391161434>, note the definition of roscale, the avatar size literally doesnt matter, since roscale is just relating studs to real life units of measurement
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 04:41:59 <@690957737391161434> what part do you not understand?
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 04:42:54 ?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:45:24 <@838973460884488233> cool concept but it looks like it can only toggle when the wheels arent steering
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 04:48:33 using character size as a reference works basically the same if you have a normal sized character, using specific measurements is just way more accurate and true to scale
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:42:26 shaders make the build appear/look better, does not make the build itself better
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:45:10 eh, its okay ig since its mini but it could be much better
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:47:39 making something mini in pc thats huge irl isnt a great idea
creations-chat 2023-01-15 05:50:02 id recommend building a new one, and make it bigger, even if you try to make a bunch of improvements on ur plane rn, you need a solid foundation to get good results
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:24:26 can someone find a good roscale bf109, I need to see what im up against
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:28:05 doesnt count as roscale unfortunately
also bf109 doesnt have 4 bladed prop? i might be wrong on that
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:31:32 it doesnt have to be 1 wide ig but the dimensions have to at least be right
creations-chat 2023-01-15 19:39:44 norway! that means i can use the giant prop engine instead of the medium one!!! more power = more speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 19:40:53 this engine fits the scale wayy better
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:22:41 shut im still working on it
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:23:03 😬
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:24:57 yea...
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:25:17 best i could do with the limited space
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:25:42 camera lock makes them father apart for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:26:04 this is the closest i could get the gear
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:27:43 norway!!!
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:27:49 no but
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:27:58 but larger not roscale anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:29:13 your 109 is very detailed and very good but is not roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:29:26 at least according to the specs i sent to u
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:31:36 most of my new builds are roscale like this unfinished pack of shits and giggles
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:31:52 because roblox heads are huge
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:33:17 the proportions are just terrible
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:34:23 😦
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:35:18 even if im not able to make it look good, its still a learning experience
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:38:29 how is this 4 and a half feet wide, a first class seat on the 777 isnt even 2 feet wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:39:05 all of these are less than a block wide considering a block is 27.5 inches wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:40:12 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:40:37 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:41:39 modern fighter jets have wider cockpits bc the sidestick and throttle are on the sides and lots of buttons and stuff o nthe side
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:41:58 bruh why they measuring with washing machines lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:42:16 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:46:47 censor what
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:48:24 oh bruh thats so small how did you guys even see it
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:49:28 because its tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:49:45 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:50:43 i think its okay if its for education purposes
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 20:50:49 cuz the pic is from a history website
contest-chat 2023-01-15 20:54:03 the intakes are interesting
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 21:13:28 yea thats what everyone uses for f-16
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 21:13:37 it shouldnt
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 21:13:53 that did happen to me once lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 21:15:40 which mirage
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 22:04:49 which wing better for bf109
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 22:08:54 the dihedral is already cam locked so that might be hard
general 2023-01-16 04:01:00 bruh
general 2023-01-16 04:01:07 aint no way
general 2023-01-16 04:01:20 did not know that word wasnt allowed
creations-chat 2023-01-16 04:02:56 <@984694509772357662> honestly not a bad heli
general 2023-01-16 04:04:11 nah it was in response to the galactic flag
general 2023-01-16 04:04:16 i think you can gues what it was
general 2023-01-16 04:04:29 why not may i ask
general 2023-01-16 04:04:39 what
general 2023-01-16 04:05:02 no what like specifically what
general 2023-01-16 04:05:13 i will
general 2023-01-16 04:05:35 oh no!!!
creations-chat 2023-01-16 04:35:33 every mistake is a learning opportunity
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:41:15 working scripts so you can code a missile to track certain things
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:41:26 and so we can make fly-by-wire systems
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:42:30 advanced logic would be nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:42:51 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:42:59 thats basically how missiles irl work
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:43:27 missile range is so bad tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:43:38 IFF would be nice too
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:44:23 chaff
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:45:04 
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:45:11 1% at most
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:45:37 you can have both on the same plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:46:04 for radar missile there are radar warning recievers
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:46:34 and a missile approach warning system can detect infrared missiles
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:46:47 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:46:56 lemme check
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:48:43 theres 3 different types of MAW systems
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:48:54 so depending on which
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:49:27 nah u literally have to get within 10ft in pvp
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:49:50 like i know dogfighting exists but thats way too much for jets
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:50:40 jets turn way too quickly bc f=ma doesnt exist for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:50:53 so if you apply a force, you get instant acceleration
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:51:34 eh it was made a long time ago so i dont blame the devs
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:54:56 honestly motor 2 needs to be remade, like its convenient to have a motor that follows your mouse, but thats in no way realistic
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:56:56 eh i just dont think it should follow your mouse
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:57:52 it just seems op for it to automatically go wherever you want, irl you have to control it like with a joystick or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:59:19 2 different ppl?
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:59:29 theres no way 1 person would control both
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:59:43 especially since they are on opposite sides of the thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 04:59:56 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:00:25 im pretty sure modern fighter jets are mostly computer controlled
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:01:10 fly-by-wire does that basically
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:01:18 but no fly-by-wire in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:01:36 yea, except somehow anything is possible in pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:02:11 fly-by-wire is more advanced than that
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:02:35 nahh lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:03:02 fly-by-wire takes into account your airspeed, altitude, aircraft weight to calculate how to move the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:03:06 yessir
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:05:02 thats literally just autopilot
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:05:08 or trim
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:05:24 im assuming u mean like
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:05:33 if someone bumps into u
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:05:41 ur plane keeps flying straight
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:06:40 most helis are already cheating so theyre way easier to balance
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:07:03 for example all the single rotor helis either use rocket/hover powered rotor or fake rotor
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:07:41 and helis with 2 blades dont have to deal with rotor torque which makes balancing easier
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:08:52 working single rotor helis are next to impossible bc u need to link main rotor to tail rotor using a drive shaft + gearbox
creations-chat 2023-01-16 05:09:24 hey i didnt dunk on ur blackhawk too hard
help 2023-01-16 05:10:27 fun fact, you basically cant (at least not well) bc pc doesnt have realistic force and mass based acceleration
creations-chat 2023-01-16 05:13:11 it was clear that you had put effort into it
general 2023-01-16 05:13:49 why is one rotor bigger lol
general 2023-01-16 05:14:21 why do u look like rodusk
general 2023-01-16 05:15:40 i doubt it
general 2023-01-16 05:15:57 they probably just make the top one smaller thinking it would look cooler
general 2023-01-16 05:16:31 YO no no symbol on the tail
creations-chat 2023-01-16 05:17:08 aint no way what
help 2023-01-16 05:18:01 try setting gravity to 0
help 2023-01-16 05:18:14 i have a feeling that gravity is doing something
general 2023-01-16 05:26:08 oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:29:47 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:35:50 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:36:06 
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:36:23 its also like 5 wide lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:36:32 
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:38:36 make the first one but roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:39:22 his "super hornet" then he got salty about ppl saying its bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:41:55 who came up with this name bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 05:42:06 jagdflugzeug GmbH
creations-chat 2023-01-16 05:44:18 why is it a square what
general 2023-01-16 05:45:46 its impossible to make small things in pc roscale basically
general 2023-01-16 05:46:42 probably not detailed lol

plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:27:26 
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:27:56 ok it got bf109 now
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:29:13 too lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:30:10 was
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:30:12 wat
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:30:59 its also hella hard to make anything good at this scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:31:57 im not gonna make it 2x as big as its supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:32:09 its already bigger than its supposed to be
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:32:52 dunno what u mean by that
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:33:40 because its tiny as hell, wingspan, length and height is all to scale and if i were to make it wider it wouldnt fit the blueprint
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:34:13 shut up ur the type of person that likes mini builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:35:30 30 feet long is like if you were 5 foot stacked 6 times, im 2 blocks tall in roblox, my plane is 13-14 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:36:17 dude the plane is like 2/3 the size of the HAL Tejas (The smallest fighter jet) how is it not supposed to be 1 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:37:32 even if i were to make it 1.5 wide it would still be bigger than the blueprint
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:39:07 dude no one is gonna sit in a fighter plane with their arms out at a 45 degree angle
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:39:25 1 wide is literally wider than a first class 777 seat and a movie theater seat
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:39:56 theres more than enough room for the pilot to keep their arms inside
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:40:51 cuz the arms are literally t posing
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:41:53 ok bruh go with ur 2-wide airliner seats so you can only fit 2 seats in a row
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:42:11 economy airline seats are literally only 2/3 of a block
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:43:01 ur probably fatter than me if im being honest lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:43:40 bru
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:47:07 what
general 2023-01-16 18:52:07 what keybinds do yall use for ur planes
general 2023-01-16 18:52:57 i use shift and control for throttle
W and S for pitch
A and D for roll
Q and E for yaw
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:54:55 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:54:55 bruh
general 2023-01-16 18:55:01 wtf
general 2023-01-16 18:57:47 can anyone help me design a bf109 wing to fit in a 3x7 space?
general 2023-01-16 18:58:00 3x6 works too
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 18:59:21 can anyone help me design a bf109 wing to fit in a 3x7 space?
3x6 works too
general 2023-01-16 18:59:36 ?
general 2023-01-16 19:00:43 get levels
general 2023-01-16 19:00:53 u need expert rank to post in here
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:01:27 current design
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:01:50 why does it matter if its a modified tut tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:02:33 literally doesnt matter

plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:06:01 THATS WHY IM ASKING FOR HELP MAKING A NEW DESIGN BRUH
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:06:38 the dihedral is already cam locked theres nowhere i can fit another angle
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:07:12 dude the bf109 is tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:07:30 the bf109 is literally smaller than every single modern fighter jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:08:46 smallest fighter jet compared to bf109
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:09:11 cessna 172 specs
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:10:14 p-47 specs
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:11:08 im not trying to tho???
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:11:20 when rickje decides to update the game
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:12:30 if i made my plane solely detail based, i'd need to make it bigger and itd be way less fun to fly an oversized ww2 propeller plane than a realistically sized one
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:13:52 if i made it 2 wide, everything else would need to be double the size
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:14:52 if i wanted to make a large fighter jet id make a su-27, im not. im making a bf109
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:15:10 tf u mean lied, i ltierally said i might be wrong
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:15:44 the thing is, thats literally ricks fault for making it hard to make small detailed builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:16:26 i am using cam lock tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:19:18 <@1047328663969992745> do you accept my challenge
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:21:04 hey do not compare me to that
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:22:07 well yea since making it seem so easy shouldnt he be able to do it?
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:22:59 im not setting any unreasonable limitations tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:23:12 u can use motorlock anglelock magnetlock camlock i dont care
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:23:43 its not tho, im not setting any retrictions aside from it being roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:25:03 that doesnt resemble an f-18 at all, at least my build slighly resembles a bf109
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:26:04 not really a hard challenge if im being honest lol i should try that too
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:26:25 i mean google recognizes it as a bf109 so id say thats a win
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 19:42:23 <@761354294859005962> dms
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 20:42:26 progress
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:46:27 how do i fix cam lock making both sides uneven
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:52:45 ass
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:58:38 😦
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 22:59:01 ill fix the tail lateer
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:04:06 the thing is, if i wanted to make a large fighter i'd make a P-47 not a BF109
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:10:47 2 wide doesnt look any better
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:11:05 you said to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:15:02 i did
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:15:32 i literally colored it out what
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:16:10 WHAT
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:18:23 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:18:47 does this work
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:19:25 wait can i use the funny windmill icon on my plane to be realism
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:20:01 ayo whered the prop go
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:31:17 does anyone have a rocker bogie suspension
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:31:49 show in dms
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:32:39 its ok just show
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:33:02 im curious
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:33:11 rocket boogie
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:33:12 ok
creations-chat 2023-01-16 23:35:30 all the new 4.5 and 5 gen fighter jets look the same
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:37:59 yea its just a few little angles put together
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:39:45 rocker bogie my beloved
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:41:28 are these actual functionting gears or just for show
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 23:42:39 out of all the rocker bogies in pcc thats the only other one that looks like it has some sort of differential gearbox, mine uses a simpler but equaly effective differential bar
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:27:55 <@761354294859005962> i thought u posted a 4 bladed one tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:28:39 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:30:05 <@761354294859005962> regular prop engine also way smaller tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:30:14 size of the blades
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:32:03 why do cargo planes like the c-130j have an 8 bladed prop, but general aviation planes only have 2 or 3 blades
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:33:06 once i finish this one
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:33:17 ill make another one using ur specs
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:34:39 C-130J
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:35:10 6 sorry
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:35:11 same thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:35:15 shut
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:35:32 shut
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:36:13 c-130 sometimes have 8 bladed props tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:36:40 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:36:45 thats literally 8 blades
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:36:59 
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:37:22 https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/115079/engineers-testing-eight-blade-prop-for-c-130/
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:37:55 "c-130 sometimes have 8 bladed props tho" thats not specific wdym
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:38:14 I CORRECTED IT AFTER U POINTED IT OUT THO
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:38:31 😦
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:39:23 but if shes dead then she isnt the queen of england anymore which means
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:39:36 which means there is no queen of england
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:40:40 i wish pc wasnt so restrictive
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:42:29 linear motors exist in pc right
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:43:48 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 02:44:08 a pully closed thing you guess kind of
contest-chat 2023-01-17 03:12:06 im thinking of making a lifting body spaceplane
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 05:15:46 ABRAMSX!!!!
plane-crazy 2023-01-17 05:16:50 does it have an interior?
general 2023-01-17 05:18:44 someone should actually make the abramsX
bug-reports 2023-01-18 01:18:28 Happened to me
bot-central 2023-01-18 01:35:09 -servers
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:40:53 most useless block in pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:42:18 yes really
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:43:00 no on said that what
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:43:26 literally wasnt talking about jets tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:43:36 i was talking about a specific block
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:44:52 easier to just use fabric in most cases bc fabric u can put on any block
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:45:00 like half blocks and wedges
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:45:49 well yea every block does, thats probably just the least used block
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 01:59:47 idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 02:22:43 made it more compact
creations-chat 2023-01-18 07:16:15 Kinda hard to make anything hyper realistic in pc
creations-chat 2023-01-18 07:31:26 i would consider those very good builds but not hyper realistic
bot-central 2023-01-18 07:40:09 ;suggest Motor
[Configurable]
be able to have a non-constant torque, to allow cars powered by motors to continue cruising with its momentum
creations-chat 2023-01-18 08:00:18 itd have to be as good as like a 3d model
creations-chat 2023-01-18 15:44:18 It’s probably close enough tbh
Shape bad tho, size is okay
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:46:53 Piston
creations-chat 2023-01-18 15:48:13 Motorlocked trails
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:56:12 The half block in front of the glass
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:56:58 Use angle lock
general 2023-01-18 23:38:23 for a one man dev team it’s okay
general 2023-01-18 23:38:37 Unless there’s more ppl working on it
general 2023-01-19 03:19:15 Nah what
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 03:25:03 I am confused by this
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 03:39:44 how did this get no votes
creations-chat 2023-01-19 03:40:15 can i post
creations-chat 2023-01-20 01:49:32 flings balls very far
creations-chat 2023-01-20 01:57:47 the ball is that one pixel
creations-chat 2023-01-20 02:07:31 nahh bro got a rounded ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:48:10 <@588596347272167456> cool build, but with the way the wing panels are in-game, the lift to drag ratio of the wing panels are probably like 3-5 at most, and its impossible to increase it further by any noticeable amount
you tried your best, but with the way the game is made, there just isnt anything you can do right now tbh
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:49:38 in some aspects yes, in other aspects, no
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:49:53 trade-offs basically
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:52:32 lift to drag ratio (glide ratio)
acceleration was too high also (from what i could see, i might be wrong)
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:57:15 eh but you didnt bc your glide ratio was maybe 1.5-2
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:58:06 when you were gliding, your trails formed a 50-60 degree angle to the horizontal
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:58:16 a 45 degree angle would be a glide ratio of 1
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:00:03 thats not what im talking about
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:00:22 im talking about when you were gliding at a constant speed at the optimal glide angle
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:00:38 that wouldnt be gliding then????
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:01:19 yes that is gliding
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:01:59 without any wind or thermals, itll still glide
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:02:08 albeit slightly worse
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:05:45 even the space shuttle had a glide ratio of 4.5:1
creations-chat 2023-01-20 03:11:01 Since some airliners have electric motors in the landing gear, could they have regenerative braking
general 2023-01-20 03:11:54 I mean their server they can do whatever they want
general 2023-01-20 03:14:38 Lasers seem way better for APS than shooting another missile to intercept
general 2023-01-20 03:14:47 No collateral damage
general 2023-01-20 03:14:51 And cheaper
general 2023-01-20 03:15:08 And can be combined with jammers and other tech
creations-chat 2023-01-20 03:16:34 Can help to charge onboard devices or go to a small battery
general 2023-01-20 03:18:36 My brain when I’m in bed
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:19:31 not possible
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:20:17 if thats what meets your standard of a functional jet engine then sure ig
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:20:48 but its impossble in pc to burn the mixture of fuel and air to create thrust
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:21:08 and fans in pc dont actually blow anything either
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:21:22 meaning helis dont have downwash
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:21:26 and no jet blast either
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:22:14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ohJse92bUc
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:23:10 why does it matter how it spins lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:23:27 oh
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:23:52 you could stack a bunch and toggle them consecutively
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:24:39 engines to spin would take up more volume than just a line of motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:25:37 thats cuz u used exploded super rockets
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:25:47 which i guess would work
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:26:27 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:26:54 are hover engines explodable like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:28:08 automatic car basically impossible in pc right
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:28:33 automatic transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:16 i made a simple 2-speed car without using a gearbox
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:29 and it can cruise without power
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:32 which is nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:36 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:47 automatic car very nice to drive
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:32:00 automatic replaces manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:40:09 hover thruster
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:48:02 aint no way bro using wheels as gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:48:18 u lose so much energy using wheels
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:48:30 actual gears???
creations-chat 2023-01-20 06:05:59 okay
help 2023-01-20 06:09:28 dude did you not do the in game tutorial
help 2023-01-20 06:09:35 it literally tells u how to play
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 06:18:44 <@849139320106516491> haha afk
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 06:20:38 haha bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 06:23:03 uh
creations-chat 2023-01-21 01:16:07 <@997579355024785559> omg so pro
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 01:19:25 trebuchet lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 01:21:48 is it a different kinda of bumper? all the ones i see look like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:03:46 join vip 1 for a free fling to the floating island
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:04:14 ive maxed out the range of this
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:32:00 omg f-117
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:37:39 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:38:01 that tall barely visible object is able to fling me across the map
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:38:42 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:40:51 https://streamable.com/69kvca
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:41:14 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:41:18 its total time played
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:41:47 total setup time takes between 10-20 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 20:41:55 nice
contest-chat 2023-01-22 06:32:18 bruh
help 2023-01-22 17:27:37 what
help 2023-01-22 17:28:05 wdym by "use a gear to push something"
contest-chat 2023-01-22 17:31:58 didnt see
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:35:18 no bc its keeps pitching up when its upside down
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:40:05 is there any helium in it? if not, climb up to like 500+ feet, reduce thrust to 0, set gravity to 0, then press flip
now your plane should just be floating in the air, now add power and tell me which way it pitches
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:44:19 okay
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:45:15 can fling humans across the map
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:52:54 <@671454925863256104> thats bc the drag model in pc is ass, im pretty sure inertia works fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:53:10 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:54:00 exposed lock + not round
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 19:17:44 i swear rick is gonna make it so unrealistic tho, irl glide ratio is based on lift to drag ratio which is largely affected by aspect ratio
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 19:18:04 i highly doubt hes gonna do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 19:21:22 sweep angle also doesnt do anything in pc
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 19:34:14 none of those are hard lol
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:38:31 make the wing less angled
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:40:46 yes
general 2023-01-22 19:41:10 why is the cooldown in <#504436696021204992> so high
creations-chat 2023-01-22 19:44:45 
general 2023-01-22 19:47:27 bruh
general 2023-01-22 19:48:08 his main wing is the same as mine
general 2023-01-22 19:48:26 except without those goofily large ailerons and elevators
general 2023-01-22 19:48:39 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 19:58:17 not my game im not gonna volunteer to do something for someone else
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:01:15 ok so why does <#507673335816126509> exist then
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:01:41 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:01:44 okay
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:04:45 thats literally what we were talking about tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:04:53 literally
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:05:19 misinformed suggestion
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:08:19 eh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:08:36 i mean to be fair the seats in pc are huge
help 2023-01-22 20:41:25 oh bruh thats called a rack and pinion
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 20:52:33 show
bug-reports 2023-01-22 20:53:49 please read these known bugs before posting a bug in here...
the-dump 2023-01-22 20:54:50 nah what
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:03:49 first of all a stud is 0.28 meters not centimeters
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:04:19 mach 1 is like 1225 speed in pc btw
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:04:55 so yea all ur calculations are basically wrong bc of that
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:14:15 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:24:40 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:25:29 ok but just because the average person walks at 4mph doesnt mean a roblox person walked at 4mph??
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:26:47 ok but where did you get that 1 sps = 1 mph
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:27:31 it says 15-16 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:27:48 u cant just use the average person as a conversion metric
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:28:04 
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:28:17 roughly can be very innaccurate
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:28:51 nah i already did
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:29:19 its 16 sps = 10.02 mph
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:30:15 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 21:31:38 1 sps in pc is equivalent to 0.63 mph
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:00:18 added another huge boost to the range
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:00:33 it can now very comfortably launch players well out of the map
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:09:46 how did he do this without exploits
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:09:52 literally dont understand
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:22:50 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:23:45 i did
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:24:07 it just looks like ur didnt set the camera and motor correctly
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:24:49 just look on youtube bro
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 23:56:08 is it a cv joint
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 23:56:57 cv joint
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:02:01 if its good ill upvote if its bad i wont its very simple
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:05:24 that doesnt make it good what
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:07:52 dude whats your point
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:11:42 shut up bro even if its not roscale the proportions are just off
general 2023-01-23 00:13:31 send link
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:18:52 one of my builds is 2 upvotes away from designer 4
general 2023-01-23 00:19:44 <@318892614378061824> did u get ur catapult to work
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:21:31 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 00:25:57 true roscale bf109 not possible to make look good
creations-chat 2023-01-23 00:27:51 closer up img pls its kinda hard to see bc of the color too
barrel is too thick
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 00:34:01 im not willing to spend my time rotating a bunch of disconnectors just to make the fuselage of a plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 00:34:49 either that or u have to have extremely thick walls
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 00:36:15 im attempting to make a b-21 rn and its only 900 blocks, even if i finish the fuselage and engines it probably wont be over maybe 1.2k

events-chat 2023-01-29 02:18:08 i want to revamp and repurpose the drive system i used on my battlebot
events-chat 2023-01-29 02:20:38 simple overview
4 columns with 8 wheels each, so 32 total
each wheel is a 5x5 cylinder 4 blocks wide
each wheel is powered by 2 motors, 1 for forward and back, 1 for turning
problems with this system, the stacked motors effectively halves useable torque leading to a very noticeable acceleration time, there is no suspension, so even on flat ground, not all the wheels are contacting the ground at all times so traction is reduced
events-chat 2023-01-29 02:26:31 first improvement i can make is increase wheels from 8 to 9 by placing them slightly outside the plot space

plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:09:42 especially with wings that long
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:10:53 <@297120728342331392> can u help me with heli now
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:11:42 wat
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:12:10 i have to roll the heli a bunch to one side to hover
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:13:50 i have to roll like a good 15 degrees to keep the heli hovering
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:15:01 ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:15:23 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:15:30 i do indeed
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:15:47 or else the heli will spin uncontrollably
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:16:20 thats what keeps my heli from spinning out of control
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:16:43 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:17:36 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:17:46 that gets rid of the rotor torque
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:18:42 ‼️
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:18:55 it also flies painfully slow
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:19:06 like 50 top speed slow
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:19:31 ⁉️
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:19:37 this one is interrobang
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:21:45 i wanna eventually be able to connect the tail rotor to the main rotor with a driveshaft-gearbox thingy but idk how
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:22:31 and i have to spin the rotor at slow speed cuz it glitches out at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:23:49 wdym by rotating at harder angles
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:24:23 just use a motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 01:25:13 and for stud increment use piston
creations-chat 2023-01-31 01:44:55 <@543029563169701908>
general 2023-01-31 01:46:22 how
general 2023-01-31 01:46:44 those angles do not look easy to make
general 2023-01-31 01:52:16 <@495210490172014612> does the afterburner work when stationary
general 2023-01-31 01:53:18 k
general 2023-01-31 02:46:44 to be fair, most ppl learn chemistry in 10th grade
general 2023-01-31 02:52:39 wdym
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:14:42 through some analysis, I have concluded that good roscale f-16 is not possible without angle locking a bunch of trails or using some method unknown to me
general 2023-01-31 03:24:19 what
general 2023-01-31 03:24:33 do you have a death wish
general 2023-01-31 03:24:52 <@&523634351922085890>
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:47:45 why does that look small for an an-225
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:48:03 put it on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:48:25 how long is it?
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:48:39 cuz real an-225 is 120 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:48:49 which would be over 2 plots long
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:49:43 u can post builds here lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:50:13 120 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:50:33 wingspan is 126
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:50:46 shut
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:51:12 thats a really big range
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:51:32 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:51:43 1 block is 0.7 meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:52:18 0.7 meters is the most exact we can get with current measurements
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:52:23 2.5
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:53:00 one stud is 0.28 meters (official roblox stat)
one block is 2.5 studs (according to rickje)
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:53:18 therefor 1 block is 0.28 * 2.5 meters which is 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:53:43 the avatar size doesnt change block to meter ratio
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:55:36 why does the camera angle distort things os much
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:55:52 dude why are u arguing about this
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:55:59 avatar height doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 03:57:08 ??? no one asked

general 2023-01-31 04:01:11 ur advice is to completely redesign my rotor system
general 2023-01-31 04:01:39 i do not want to be an average pc player
general 2023-01-31 04:02:03 i will not cheat by making my rotors rocket powered

plane-crazy 2023-01-31 04:24:16 i tried
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 04:24:24 i angled the whole heli like 5 degrees
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 04:24:37 but any tiny input of collective makes heli go up
general 2023-01-31 04:24:43 noooooo

plane-crazy 2023-02-01 01:57:03 ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 01:59:11 no but
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 01:59:26 as long as the motor speed isnt synced perfectly it wont work
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 01:59:40 you have to time it perfectly basically
plane-crazy 2023-02-01 02:00:02 its much more reliable to have a linkage that controls the blade pitch automatically

general 2023-02-01 03:15:32 nah what
general 2023-02-01 03:16:09 777x is not 4 plots long
general 2023-02-01 03:18:12 i dont have to think about it since ive already thought about it before
general 2023-02-01 03:18:54 dude
general 2023-02-01 03:19:00 a 777x is not 4 plots long

general 2023-02-01 03:23:10 what
general 2023-02-01 03:23:13 what is that logic
general 2023-02-01 03:24:31 i have no idea how you are doing your calculations
general 2023-02-01 03:24:53 it is definitely possible to make the 777x accurately sized in pc
general 2023-02-01 03:25:22 dude
general 2023-02-01 03:25:50 bro are u dumb or are you dumb
general 2023-02-01 03:25:58 a320 is not 2 plots long
general 2023-02-01 03:28:16 where did you get that from
general 2023-02-01 03:28:30 where did you get that 37 meters = 2 plots
general 2023-02-01 03:28:36 51 blocks
general 2023-02-01 03:28:51 ?
general 2023-02-01 03:28:55 its 51 blocks long
general 2023-02-01 03:28:59 bro

plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:35:58 making some blocks ice also reduces weight
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:36:35 a balance is a lot easier lo
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:38:55 ima go take a dump
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:40:50 It came out
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:41:00 No
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:41:09 Some blocks become heavier when set to ice
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:44:05 <@663558749109092372> some floatplanes also have little water propellers on the floats
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 03:50:06 I have no idea lo

general 2023-02-04 16:35:45 i already told you its not balanced correctly

plane-crazy 2023-02-05 01:51:17 exposed lock + no interior + chair sticking out
creations-chat 2023-02-05 01:53:31 why not just get close enough to use the cannon
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:01:09 i care
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:02:31 is this a viable design?
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:03:31 the exposed motors are killing me
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:11:14 trying to make some 6th gen fighter shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:18:09 
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:49:51 how many plots long
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 02:50:32 yea thats pretty accurate to irl size as well
general 2023-02-05 02:51:48 why do i think a modernized an-225 could be so good
general 2023-02-05 02:52:01 it could be made mostly of composites to reduce weight
general 2023-02-05 02:52:35 have 4 instead of 6, larger, more powerful turbofans for greater thrust and efficiency
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 05:26:08 goofy ahh m1
general 2023-02-05 05:27:28 nah wtf the map is 2 miles?
general 2023-02-05 05:27:42 it seems so small tho
general 2023-02-05 05:27:47 how is it 2 miles
general 2023-02-05 05:28:48 oh nah what
general 2023-02-05 05:28:54 a stud is not 5 centimeters
general 2023-02-05 05:29:16 1 stud is 28 centimeters i think
general 2023-02-05 05:30:28 500 sps is NOT 55 mph
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 05:38:07 eh
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 05:38:17 for how big it is id expect better
plane-crazy 2023-02-05 05:38:46 the front turret armor on the right side is also supposed to be angled less than the left
general 2023-02-05 05:39:07 16 is walking i think
general 2023-02-05 05:40:42 <@495210490172014612> walking is 15, running is 40

general 2023-02-05 21:31:17 yeaa... good luck
general 2023-02-05 21:31:27 its way easier to just use motors

help 2023-02-06 01:50:48 (most likely something welded)
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:51:38 mm yes very mini
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:52:39 lo
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:52:53 "only"
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:54:37 why do ppl always make the road wheels so wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:55:07 this for comparison
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:57:16 get rid of sparkler bases
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:57:38 add working tank treads
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:58:02 yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:58:12 use signs or something
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:59:39 what
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 01:59:48 what
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:01:52 nah what
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:02:04 how would that fit
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:02:16 ok
general 2023-02-06 02:14:44 787
general 2023-02-06 02:15:02 technically most airliners are nearly impossible
general 2023-02-06 02:15:24 realistically no
general 2023-02-06 02:15:38 ok but
general 2023-02-06 02:15:39 but
general 2023-02-06 02:15:49 the walls of the plane need to be made of disconnectors
general 2023-02-06 02:15:59 or something of a similar thickness
general 2023-02-06 02:16:04 ok
general 2023-02-06 02:16:20 then i dont see why the 777x isnt possible
general 2023-02-06 02:16:23 scale-wise
general 2023-02-06 02:16:45 oh no its you again
general 2023-02-06 02:17:00 an a320 is not 2 plots long
general 2023-02-06 02:17:24 its slightly longer than 1 plot
general 2023-02-06 02:17:39 ???
general 2023-02-06 02:17:51 that doesnt change the fact that the a320 isnt 2 plots long
general 2023-02-06 02:18:05 so ur literally just guesstimating
general 2023-02-06 02:18:26 whereas im using the actual published dimensions and conversion units
general 2023-02-06 02:18:46 which is why you're so off
general 2023-02-06 02:19:50 jesus christ bro, that doesnt change the fact that using official measurements you can calculate the exact block count for the length of the a320
general 2023-02-06 02:20:30 a320 in pc is 53.67 blocks long
general 2023-02-06 02:20:42 which is just barely longer than 1 plot
general 2023-02-06 02:20:49 1 plot is 51 blocks long
general 2023-02-06 02:21:14 yessir
general 2023-02-06 02:21:31 💀
general 2023-02-06 02:21:40 okay what
general 2023-02-06 02:21:45 when was 3 blocks 1 meter
general 2023-02-06 02:22:07 ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:24:18 
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:27:16 Probably just sparkler with delta wing fins
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:27:58 Ok but the fins have to stick out which makes it not 1x1
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:29:05 I would not consider it a missile if it doesn’t have fins that stick out
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:29:39 So it’s just a 1x4 beam with stuff in it
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:30:19 Tailed fighter jets bad
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:30:29 The tail increases drag and weight
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 02:32:13 Rickje is going to make leading edge slats actually increase lift in pc2

The deadly quake is one of the most powerful to hit Turkey in the past 100 years
general 2023-02-06 05:01:27 The USGS said an equally powerful 7.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Turkey in 1939 resulted in more than 30,000 deaths.
general 2023-02-06 05:01:44 76 deaths so far is a lot better than 30k in 1939
general 2023-02-06 05:01:55 for the same magnitud earthquake
general 2023-02-06 05:02:32 what
general 2023-02-06 05:02:38 500 injured
general 2023-02-06 05:03:37 Turkey is no stranger to strong earthquakes; seven quakes with magnitude 7.0 or greater have struck the country in the past 25 years

general 2023-02-06 05:17:26 all purchases are final
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:18:20 gamepass owners should get a role
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:18:32 at least when pc2 releases
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:21:19 why is there an shortened form of "there is" but not for "there are"
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:21:58 nah what is that
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:22:45 dude you should try something easier first to refine your skills
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:22:56 try easier
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:23:22 its quite... interesting
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:23:34 work easier not smarter

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:28:08 i just thought id make a weirdly angled plane
general 2023-02-06 05:30:03 <@819799052178554921> if you need robux, use microsoft rewards, it takes a while, but its free to use and pretty rewarding
general 2023-02-06 05:30:45 i hate the pronounciation of that word bruh

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:40:09 does this shape look better
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 05:40:21 random 6th gen fighter concept
general 2023-02-06 05:44:00 fun fact: thats not a good way to check if someone is underage
general 2023-02-06 05:44:13 then why are u in this
general 2023-02-06 05:44:41 that only shows iif their account is under 13
general 2023-02-06 05:44:57 the account age says nothing about someones actual age
general 2023-02-06 05:45:10 i could easily set my age to be 69

plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:21:18 the exposed lock bro
creations-chat 2023-02-06 06:21:55 how do i hide exposed motors
creations-chat 2023-02-06 06:24:41 the bottom is worse
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:40:39 i know
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:40:49 wait actually
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:41:06 there arent any concave 90 degree angles
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:41:19 for what
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:41:41 got rid of the seat back
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:42:20 yea its fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:44:13 ok that because its exposed lock
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:44:20 i cant really do much about it
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:44:35 its not intended is what i mean
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:51:41 eh/
creations-chat 2023-02-06 06:51:53 i tried
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:54:40 black windows look ok
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:57:23 diff angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 06:59:52 i acually dk if i can finish this
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 07:00:10 like there is actually no internal space to fit any sort of landing gear
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 07:08:37 
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 07:12:50 made gear longer
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 07:18:42 its so small that anything and everything is exposed
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 15:39:36 Wouldn’t a suspension work
general 2023-02-07 00:32:49 very hard to make to accurate size
general 2023-02-07 00:33:02 to be fair im pretty sure none of them have been accurate
general 2023-02-07 00:47:06 is it possible to combine the exhaust of 2 engines into 1 exhaust stream?
general 2023-02-07 00:47:16 like 1 nozzle for 2 jet engines
general 2023-02-07 00:47:24 irl
general 2023-02-07 01:39:44 air very cold, payload warm
general 2023-02-07 01:40:02 no
general 2023-02-07 01:40:09 it was 1 missile im pretty sure
general 2023-02-07 01:41:57 gas:
general 2023-02-07 01:43:07 how
general 2023-02-07 01:43:43 nah its pretty accurate
general 2023-02-07 01:48:00 thats what makes it stay in the air for a long time
general 2023-02-07 01:49:16 how tf are u gonna shoot it down when all your anti air has been destroyed by f-35s, and theres ifvs and infantry killing any enemy they see
general 2023-02-07 01:50:25 kill bunkers and shit
general 2023-02-07 01:51:35 a-10 is pretty much the only one designed purely for that tho
general 2023-02-07 01:51:53 a-10 can carry more bombs than the f-35 in its beast mode configuration (i think)
general 2023-02-07 01:52:59 💀
general 2023-02-07 01:54:02 a10 when the enemy's air defense has been destroyed by stealth fighters:
general 2023-02-07 01:55:42 why would u use the a-10 without air superiority tho
general 2023-02-07 01:55:58 wow top speed in kilograms
general 2023-02-07 01:58:15 do you understand the different between thte 30mm round and the 20mm round
creations-chat 2023-02-07 02:12:01 could work for this
general 2023-02-07 03:08:40 if its that big then yea id assume it would have working treads
general 2023-02-07 03:15:34 why
general 2023-02-07 03:15:44 why would you paint a tank with a gradient
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 03:16:09 good progress
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 03:16:41 wat
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 03:16:49 ok
general 2023-02-07 03:21:56 oh its that
general 2023-02-07 03:22:06 that star wars thing
general 2023-02-07 03:22:07 isnt it
general 2023-02-07 03:22:25 dont use gradient

help 2023-03-02 02:56:57 why
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:03:20 whether or not its "bad" depends on who you ask, but we can all agree that its worse than most modern fighter jets
creations-chat 2023-03-02 03:12:59 it is both negative and inevitable
idk what you consider to be a "negative", but in fighter jet design, almost everything is a trade-off, and we value some aspects more than others for fighter jets. So yes, an f-14 used to be cheaper to buy and maintain than an f-22 today, but the capabilities of the f-22 are unmatched by the f-14
TLDR;
Fighter jet combat effectiveness is probably the most important aspect to consider, more so than anything else

also everything is going to have negatives no matter what, an f-14 just has more negatives and less positives than an f-22

help 2023-03-04 01:28:18 
help 2023-03-04 01:36:01 yea cuz i need to lock the seat down half a block
help 2023-03-04 01:40:49 i am in vip 1 btw
help 2023-03-04 01:41:15 yea but then it isnt the right height so im just using normal pilot seats in the cockpit
help 2023-03-04 01:41:38 like i could but it wouldnt look right since the seat would either be too high or too low
help 2023-03-04 01:42:22 its with cam lock binding to the main pilot seat
help 2023-03-04 01:42:39 best course of action is to either leave it as is, or replace with angle lock
help 2023-03-04 01:46:55 the position of the camera relative to the main pilot seat is fixed, meaning i cant have it half a block higher than the wings
help 2023-03-04 01:49:05 thats what i said
help 2023-03-04 01:49:24 i just need to figure out how to replace it with angle lock without needing to redo a bunch of stuff

plane-crazy 2023-03-04 05:28:27 
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 05:29:22 rule of thumb for airliners is the wingspan should be just slightly shorter than the overall length of the plane (depends on variant obviously)
plane-crazy 2023-03-04 05:30:53 some kid at my school brought spent bullet casings to DnD club so it got cancelled

plane-crazy 2023-03-10 06:03:18 i made it coax but now it shakes when i try to start it up
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 06:09:44 wha

plane-crazy 2023-03-10 15:18:41 u can get rid of the sparkler base using explosives
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 15:19:32 ah
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 15:20:21 my heli rolls to the side when i fly forward

general 2023-03-12 23:07:37 i never said it was a problem
general 2023-03-12 23:08:28 thats a question
general 2023-03-12 23:08:53 "why do you do X" does not mean "doing X is a problem"
general 2023-03-12 23:22:33 the question was "price and maintenance aside what is negative about the tomcat"
general 2023-03-12 23:23:22 my answer was not that the f-14 is bad, but I just pointed out its negatives, something having negatives doesnt not make it "bad" when everything is a trade-off
general 2023-03-12 23:25:19 sooo ur saying that the f-14 doesnt have any negatives aside from price and maintenance
general 2023-03-12 23:39:35 nah but i swear i read that somewhere

general 2023-03-14 01:32:00 ok
general 2023-03-14 02:02:50 glide ratio is not affected by weight (according to multiple sources on google), wing surface area does not directly affect glide ratio, while aspect ratio does directly affect glide ratio
general 2023-03-14 02:03:55 was replying so its not an unnessecary ping
general 2023-03-14 02:04:18 idk i just found it
general 2023-03-14 02:04:24 no i swear
general 2023-03-14 02:06:06 assuming all other factors remain the same, wing area decreasing increases both horizontal speed and sink rate, but glide ratio remains the same
general 2023-03-14 02:08:40 bruh
