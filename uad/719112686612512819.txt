bug-reports 2020-10-30 16:07:54 I took the pic while ago but what happened
bug-reports 2020-10-30 16:08:15 It fixed after rejoining

general 2020-11-03 19:59:25 I can't live without motorlock
general 2020-11-03 20:03:51 If we wait for it it will eventually get fixed again
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:38:38 Do they really have to make lag machines? Just because they lost at pvp?
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:39:29 actually that didn't do anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:39:30 not laggy
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:39:58 Well that lag machine didn't even lag
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:41:02 I take back the "The lag machine didnt even lag"
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 20:41:08 Its lagging like hell, The entire game froze
help 2020-11-04 20:44:28 Uhm this is a report, This guy completely froze the server, Conveyors don't work, and players froze
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:33:59 I got pinged but I dont know who said it
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:22:57 yeah I do not know how to make intakes
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:52:49 I tried my best and tried to fix the intake, This is the best I could do
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:55:27 > you made good effort but not expert :/
<@!588055079899103299> true, i don't know why I got so many upvotes though

Very sus, kinda looks like the tutorial
bug-reports 2020-12-07 14:00:20 maybe its because you set that yellow thing sideways or made it face down or backwards
general 2020-12-10 01:59:49 is there an update or something
bug-reports 2020-12-11 19:21:50 parachute.. but without parachute?
bug-reports 2020-12-11 19:23:01 that also happened to me once, I moved my mech up before it finished loading, and when it happened I was panicking
bug-reports 2020-12-15 15:16:06 "shredder = ban"
<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2020-12-15 15:24:55 normal stuff
bug-reports 2020-12-15 15:25:13 and I still haven't found my parachute yet.
creations-chat 2020-12-15 15:34:20 no
general 2020-12-16 20:34:27 holy crap the update?
general 2020-12-16 20:34:34 finally
general 2020-12-16 20:35:41 I CANNOT DESCRIBE MY HAPPINESS RIGHT NOW

general 2020-12-16 20:36:11 1
general 2020-12-16 20:42:49 so as soon as I joined I took out my USS Iowa drove to the docks and now what is this; ice is gone and now im hitting invisible wall, epic.
general 2020-12-16 20:43:05 same problem there
general 2020-12-16 20:43:20 none on my server too
general 2020-12-17 00:34:38 fastest way to turn it off is alt f4
general 2020-12-17 00:34:46 its true though
general 2020-12-17 18:11:28 server ded
general 2020-12-17 18:16:36 no updates
general 2020-12-17 18:16:41 I checked it.
general 2020-12-17 18:17:02 yes.
general 2020-12-24 22:56:40 I saw some very NSFW thing ingame
bug-reports 2021-01-21 15:55:32 
bug-reports 2021-01-21 15:55:36 Yeah uhh
bug-reports 2021-01-21 15:55:38 This is fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:44:58 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:45:03 
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 21:33:43 "bug fixes"
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 21:33:44 alright
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 21:34:28 
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 14:36:58 bug fixes?
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 14:37:09 it looked way worse before the blocks were stretched all over the map
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 14:37:18 nice
general 2021-03-06 19:07:46 Copy what? Also if you're talking about the carrier (Since I just uploaded it today, I'd assume you are), I didn't; I built this in my private server. Also I don't even know you
general 2021-03-06 19:08:07 I might have ruined the chain accidentally
general 2021-03-06 20:44:50 first of all: I don't know you, second, I never even saw that thing in my life, third, same idea doesnt mean its copied
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:24:57 wtf is wrong with server lags these days
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:25:13 I cant even load a 6000 block build without literally freezing the entire server for 50 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:29:30 so when I folded my carrier before, it was 120 fps
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:29:33 now its -10
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:29:39 I think something is wrong with that
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:31:43 maybe its just problems with lock
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:31:59 whats your point
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:32:22 apparently other people are experiencing this too
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:32:31 my whole server is begging for their lives
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:32:37 and they think im the one causing the lag
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:33:09 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:36:59 found a very weird glitch
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:37:13 I sat on a random person's seat and spawned
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:37:18 it teleported their main pilot seat to my base
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:37:34 
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:37:39 They sent me that screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:38:01 *interesting hitbox*
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:38:46 Really broke the game
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:38:53 Also after spawning their main pilot gets teleported to my base
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:39:15 They put an anchor under the main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:39:18 and it still teleported
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:39:26 *what is happening*
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:44:34 I found out how to do it consistently
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:44:53 I thought it would only bring the main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:44:56 But it brought the whole build
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:46:50 That was after they spawned
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:46:58 it wasn't when they were in build mode
general 2022-03-22 10:55:20 the e
