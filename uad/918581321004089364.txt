plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:46:44 (i have a bad pc dont mind)
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:48:09 No.
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:48:19 make sus amogus
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:48:35 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:51:44 where do i put my creations
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 20:52:31 Ok found it thx i didnt realize it existed
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:02:21 the reason why i have so low fps and why my builds have exposed motorlock at some parts and the wings have gaps its because i need to save blocks, plus make a build stable in movement and i have a bad pc (very very bad pc)
also exposed motorlock can sometimes be used as detail and i think that sopwith camel is my first build with angle lock
i used to have a bad pc back then but now i have a worse one, so the builds that were adapted for my old bad (but not bad as this one) pc are most unusable, the sopwith camel and the tanks are the most recent creations i have and were on this bad bad bad pc
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:05:36 also since i have a bad pc i cannot really use my full potential and one of the reasons why i barely play plane crazy now
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:08:02 im an aviation noob idk what that plane is can i have knowledge
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:10:44 i use an scale that i think would be to if a roblox character was the size of a human scale wich is 1 block 0.9 meters
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:12:49 Amaze
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:15:24 i posted my tanks and they got downvoted, then my plane and it got upvoted, same scale, plane bias!?!?!?!? also how does one achieve a cool rank
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:18:32 Ok
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:26:41 yes lol
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:32:53 it also exclusively works only with those 2 propellers
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:44:36 dont think thats low effort
probably hes a noob and it may be effort to his view, it would be low effort if he was a pro or smth thats just posting it for comedic purposes
creations-chat 2022-01-15 21:48:37 Nic
general 2022-03-21 17:26:46 plane crazy community be like: ahahahaha i have a gamer pc so i can overdetail my stuff without blowing up my pc when i load in my builds!
general 2022-03-21 17:28:03 No i have a shit pc that runs plane crazy at lowest quality 50 fps and when i load in a build it goes down to 30 and if its detailed 20 and if its overdetailed 10, plus all my planes wobble so i cant fly them anymore (used to be on a bad but slightly better pc where they wobbled less but its now literally impossible)
general 2022-03-21 17:28:25 Bird
general 2022-03-21 17:28:55 Ok
general 2022-03-21 17:29:02 because you have a better pc
general 2022-03-21 17:29:09 Give up nobody will win
general 2022-03-21 17:29:45 Billy's bonka
general 2022-03-21 17:32:44 dude, just because your pc is old doesnt mean its bad
general 2022-03-21 17:32:59 bro my pc is quite new yet it has an analog writer and its been hit several times so its been deteriorated to the point it runs like a turtle
general 2022-03-21 17:33:22 Ok then explain why his pc probably runs way better than mine
general 2022-03-21 17:33:27 im not who bought it, it was my brother
general 2022-03-21 17:33:59 he left me with this trash pc when he got his 3.4 million pesos gamer laptop that runs garry's mod 120 fps full graphics and roblox at 240 fps full graphics, not exaggerating
general 2022-03-21 17:34:14 also i havent downloaded any games other than roblox so my pc doesnt run like trash
general 2022-03-21 17:34:25 i said PESOS not DOLLARS
general 2022-03-21 17:34:32 im on colombia
general 2022-03-21 17:34:33 dumbass
general 2022-03-21 17:34:58 Yes
general 2022-03-21 17:35:01 ok back to what i was gonn say
general 2022-03-21 17:35:03 gonna say
general 2022-03-21 17:35:28 i dont know im not a pc/laptop expert
general 2022-03-21 17:35:37 but his pc runs VERY fast
general 2022-03-21 17:35:43 im talking about his, not mine
general 2022-03-21 17:36:43 also mine is meant to run decently probably even better than the older one i had but the reason this one is worse than the older one i had is because it has an analog writer, analog writers get deteriorated VERY FAST overtime as my brother told me, and now it has problems writing information wich ressults on the pc having a lot of data storage and capacity but running like a turtle
general 2022-03-21 17:37:07 im not talking to you you literally just joined this conversation this moment?
general 2022-03-21 17:37:21 clown thinks its funny to enter conversation just to say "who asked"
general 2022-03-21 17:37:27 yea... posting memes...
general 2022-03-21 17:38:02 correct and i have no explanation as to why but its still impossible to deny it: my pc runs like trash and idk why everyone is comparing computers and idk trying to call me a liar as to me saying my pc is trash when it clearly pretty much is
general 2022-03-21 17:38:25 Ok
general 2022-03-21 17:38:50 funi
general 2022-03-21 17:39:09 im complaining about the fact you called an issue of having a bad pc a skill issue
general 2022-03-21 17:39:28 and complaining also about people calling me a liar when pretty much its impossible to lie about my pc being literal trash

the-dump 2022-03-21 17:59:01 AMAZON PARROTS, not "parrots" in general
the-dump 2022-03-21 17:59:14 and im not talking about AMAZON PARROTS IN GENERAL EITHER, im reffering to the specific species of parrots i have
the-dump 2022-03-21 17:59:29 and yes they may be as pets rarely on houses but NEVER in the wild unless they escaped but they will die off fastly due to being used to captivity
the-dump 2022-03-21 17:59:55 yea ok guess kramer's parakeet is the same as the yellow-crowned amazon
the-dump 2022-03-21 18:00:52 Yea pretty much looks the exact same
the-dump 2022-03-21 18:01:01 you have been using those as "proof" that the yellow crowned amazon lives in the uk..?
the-dump 2022-03-21 18:01:32 i dont think this
the-dump 2022-03-21 18:01:42 is the same as this }
the-dump 2022-03-21 18:02:06 ive said 10 times, i know that your kramer parakeets live in the uk but my amazon parrots dont and you kept saying "they do" and showing me the same fucking kramer parakeet wikipedia page

creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:44:19 It doesnt let me post videos in creations
help 2022-04-03 20:45:21 How do i post videos on creations (it does not allow me)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:46:45 https://streamable.com/tr53w1 Monitor video

https://streamable.com/20lwx6 FB5 Gunbus video
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:49:17 POV: They downvote your build for lack of detail despite it being practicly impossible to add (cant add turret railing or id sacrifice the recoil/elevation system for guns and i cant add hull railing because overall id lag too much)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:51:24 do it yourself bozo (after somehow recreating the turret, its 7 blocks wide 3 tall but with the floor its 4 tall and it has a 6 block tall mast, the turret has a recoil system and elevation, uses rockets as weapon)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:53:44 turret close up (i hate cannon 2 it messes up despite being an exact recreation of cannon 1 and i dug as far as i could trying to find something that makes it want to mess up) also it is not a submarine you dumbass its the USS monitor and yes i could add anchors and hatches to the floor but that detail is just gonna make the build laggier than it is
i may actually add anchor and hatches later the system  and detail would just cost at most 30 blocks and a US flag too (but too lazy rn)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:56:17 my friend is mobile and he lags 10 times less i already argued 1000 times why just because im on pc doesnt mean its impossible it to be worse than mobile when i have proved and already showed that its worse than some mobile devices, dont feel like explaining all that again
creations-chat 2022-04-03 20:59:02 also why call a build bad sometimes all the detail thats added is the limit of detail that can be added, ok theres exposed motors for the rotation in my fb5 but is THERE REALLY any way to hide those without adding exposed motorlock or making the build have 2000+ blocks or increasing the build size? (and its already oversized, x2 scale aka 1 block 0.45 meters) and bro im just a kid and they're already getting me a new pc for my birthday all i need to is to wait, and the only time ive been got bought robux was 3 years ago, 400 robux once and normal builders club wich is NOTHING compared to the cost of a better pc
its angering when people calls a build bad but you are the only one whos sentient that its impossible to give it more detail because of certain design limitations
YES i admit i could've added more detail to the monitor and it isnt impossible and that lag is the only limitation BUT WHAT ABOUT THE F.B.5 GUNBUS FOR EXAMPLE? its impossible, it simply is, and you wont believe me because you arent the one who faced all the technical problems trying to add the limit detail (wich is very low) that could've been added
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:02:18 This is the tower required to add the detail the fb5 gunbus currently has, and its at the limit of detail
465 blocks yet its only 19 blocks long aka 31,67 of the monitor's lenght AND REALLY ONLY 8 OF THOSE BLOCKS ARE THE FUSELAGE WICH CAN BE ADDED MOTORLOCK TO, PART OF THE MOTORLOCK SPACE IS KILLED OFF BY THE ENGINES AND THE SPACE FOR SEATS AND EVEN SO I HAD TO SACRIFICE THE CLEARANCE OF THE FRONT SEAT FOR MOTORLOCK AND I ALSO NEED TO FIT A ROTATING TURRET ON THE FRONT
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:05:18 Also im a 14 year old about to turn 15 not a 18 year old dumbfuck and i have a school to attend no time for a job to get a dumbass pc and i already explained you why i didnt add that much detail and the one im saying that is impossible to add detail to is the FB.5 Gunbus not the monitor, but whatever way i cant add detail to the monitor without blowing up my pc
AND THEYRE ALREADY GOING TO BUY ME A PC THIS YEAR
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:08:46 what the fuck is a grand bro and what lawns can i mow if nobody in my neighborhood has a frontyard im on colombia not the land of liberty and burgers
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:11:39 yea because i currently dont have any homework <@!472553877711880211>  and <@456226577798135808> everyone does the colombian cheese joke why cant i insult this man (once after getting insulted 100 times by the same man) and <@!799099959953063956> theres a difference between being good and having a pc good enough to handle all the detail i can add to a build
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:14:44 cant i just say one insult in defense..? and <@!690931622345834527> my pc literally runs 10 fps 1st quality with a 888 block build and speed is reduced to half for the build, beat that
the type of device isnt the same thing as how it peforms, laptop doesnt always mean bad, desktop doesnt always mean good, mobile doesnt always mean mediocre
<@456226577798135808> EXACTLY i cant beat that
<@!799099959953063956> im not arguing over my build but over the fact that you guys are hell toxic and all you can say is "get a better pc" and "get better skill"
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:17:10 im not bragging, im using it as defense in this argument
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:19:46 its indeed an argument, your point is that i apparently dont have skill that im an unde and that i apparently can get a better pc, my point is that im not an unde, i have sufficent skill but i cant use it because of my bad computer that cant run better than treefactory1's device for some random fucked up reason and that i cant get a better pc right this exact moment but i will in a few weeks
ALSO before asking me to add detail to my build prove that its atleast possible (not of the monitor im already sentient its possible on that one but on the fb5 its indeed impossible without changing size)
<@!799099959953063956> all i am doing is defending myself in an argument why should i be muted? if anything atleast <@!925548477327491073> should get mute
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:21:54 its a computer issue not a skill issue when will you dumbasses learn the difference of skill and having a good pc?????
treefactory1 THATS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID, THAT YOUR DEVICE IS INDEED BETTER, DID I DO ANYTHING RELATED THE SLIGHTEST TO SAYING THAT IT IS WORSE THAN MY PC OR ANYTHING?
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:24:11 fantastic idea why didnt i think about that in the first place
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:27:55 it isnt feedback when they are being rude on purpose or if it really has no relation to improving it because feedback is to help the creator to improve it based on what you think. (saying skill issue is not feedback)
creations-chat 2022-04-03 21:30:02 Welp im out i got other stuff to do 🦜
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:19:13 https://streamable.com/m0c0uk P-47 (it doesnt let me post videos on <#384025409945337856> )
the sliding cockpit tends to sometimes jam but by the rest it works
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:22:53 i measured the scale with a ruler on a blueprint (literally) and used a % calculator page to get the scale, the lenght width and height is correct and the p-47d has that at the back of the canopy unlike the normal version
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:25:01 actually they kinda be lookin' badass when front facing also i do think the height looks weird and for that same reason i also verified it so im pretty sure the scale of the height wingspan and lenght is correct (but for some reason it looks odd so probably its instead the shape OR the fact that it has that at the back of the canopy)
YEA if you ignore it the height actually looks less odd
Should i make it have normal canopy and remove the back part? (i start to hate it tbh)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:27:16 the text on the propeller says "una ave mas" (yet another bird in english or another bird)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:29:56 Thats bc of the distance and bad quality of image also NORMAL CANOPY LOOKS MORE NORMAL but it weirdens me (Found out why ima fix)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:32:07 Looks more normal now also uh the colors are meant to be bright but yea i think the white should be slightly darker but too lazy to fix tbh (Should i remove the string in order to make the pole thingy at the back less tall it looks hideous i cant angle it in any way bc no space and uh it looks too wide and string isnt that visible anyway)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:38:48 I feel like the cockpit has to be moved forward (yea it has to)
what color needs fix btw only the white? (the black is perfect)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:50:43 Fixed cockpit moved it forward and more also <@!771407578285867108> what color do i fix?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:52:52 thats literally the p-47 canopy shape i cant do anything abt it also video https://streamable.com/8yrurp
the flag colors are bright wich is correct the only color that seems wrong is the white but fine ima fix them all except black
creations-chat 2022-04-05 02:55:20 Ok
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:01:08 Colors better now? (forgot to paint a part wait)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:03:23 there also its literally the most accurate possible to the p-47 shape (your kind of basicly calling the p-47 garbage) i measured the distances and angles accurately because i like when its the most perfect possible so theres a difference between the build being shit and the way it looks in the game being shit
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:06:35 wow ok but its the plane the US sold to colombia during the 40s and 50s 😦
Also another color fix also <@!740790456182636595> yes the plane is ugly say what you want but its accurate ALSO thats because they had better luck with the size and stuff they can fit, and i added a sliding cockpit so i cant add an overdetailed cockpit and i have a 2 block wide fuselage with angles on the sides unlike a 1 block wide fuselage so less detail can be added but the shape is better
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:11:50 I told you the cockpit cant have detail because itd break the sliding cockpit mechanism also i used angle lock for the wings
<@!870152086044700682> you are saying that by just taking a glance at it, measure it properly or use a blueprint to compare before saying anything because i translated the size of the plane to get the correct size ingame for stuff like cockpit distance from the front, wingspan, lenght, tailspan, landing gear height, wing lenght and position ETC
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:15:16 the only thing i didnt measure properly was the cockpit (i did it before a different way but when i remade it i was too lazy to re-measure) but by the rest its measured properly
creations-chat 2022-04-05 03:19:17 i like sliding cockpit because it looks very unusual and literally nobody does that other than me and uh i was gonna do spitfire but i did the p-47 (i asked someone to tell me what plane to do) and uh it was a good choice bc it was fast and easy to do because i had luck at some parts and i didnt stall with errors and issues (unlike what the spitfire could've caused if i had bad luck but who knows i probably would've had even more luck)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:05:52 1. it wasnt a sufficently large scale to make slab wide wings because they would have been too wide
2. theres no way to not make it super blocky without making it have far too exaggerated angles
3. its complicated because of the system in it not because of the detail, and i added a sliding cockpit instead of detail because i wanted to i dont like not being able to get out of my vehicle and i like functionality on vehicles over detail sometimes
its actually x1.3 scale and its still not big enough to give it slab block tall wings wich would've been disproportional
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:08:22 I just realized it is indeed possible to give the plane detail on the cockpit because none of it is on the sliding part, time to attempt it but it may still block the system
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:11:20 Also im forced to use mini scale because i cant make large scale since that means a lot of blocks and i have a laggy ass pc that runs 10 fps on 1 quality when using a 888 block build and even my "mini" scale plane is nearly 400 blocks (and im not exaggerating about it)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:14:16 Should i actually wait for my new pc before adding more detail to this thing's cockpit? (just to upgrade it i have to double the total height of the motorlock tower because i need 3 pieces of rotated motorlock)
it already has a laggy peformance and wobbles at full speed it barely works with my bad pc so i should wait for my new pc before i upgrade it, i have similar plans for the monitor
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:19:38 Time to repeat that: wobbling is caused by that yes but lag also takes part, you dont know this because you probably have a powerfull ass gaming pc, i had a less laggy (still garbage) pc and my planes didnt wobble much but under enough lag they wobbled so hard they pitched up and became uncontrollable, now im on a worse (KEYWORD: Worse) and laggier (KEYWORD: laggier) pc and they wobble so hard at full speed or half speed that most of them are impossible to control like my hover fighter jet or all my other ww2 planes and my large planes are too laggy to even be spawned bc if in my old pc i went 10 fps with my major sized now imagine in this one (and those planes mentioned are on my alts, im using my main bc its full of old stuff i can kill unlike my old alt and i dont want to get rid of all my now obsolete due to lag stuff because it will be useable when i get my better pc)
Sufficent proof?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:21:46 me because im probably the only one whos smart enough to realize that (OR PROBABLY I ONLY REALIZE THAT BECAUSE IM WHO HAS TO SUFFER TO IT 😐 )
also saying that my pc is bad and i have lag isnt enough they'd say the exact same (literally what i did before i wrote that btw!) so i have to write a whole paragraph of proof on why LAG does cause WOBBLING too.
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:24:19 much better
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:26:22 a ruler and a blueprint and a page that is on spanish to calculate % (because i used % to transfer meters to the scale i was currently using for the build) and even if the ruler isnt 100% accurate its very close, and please "because that is not correct at all" are you saying that just because you looked at it or you are the one who measured it all? Can give you images of top, below, sides, front and back so you can compare it to a blueprint or measure it yourself if you want
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:29:44 what the hell happened to the tail the lenght is literally 16 blocks from the rudder to the front without counting propeller and i verified it?
thats 11.2 meters wich is 0.2 off what the wikipedia page said about the p-47 lenght
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:33:11 the cockpit is 1 block tall but it was meant to be 0.8 couldnt do it to inaccuracy, you should've lined it to fuselage because thats what i made most accurate, also the blueprint may be looking off from the tail because of the 3d perspective Also here it is the lenght, 7 + 7 + 2 = 16 and i used 1 block 0.7 and <@!487016674260680716> i can add that detail right now but i wont bc i lag a lot and i need to extend the motorlock system id rather wait for my better pc
Also wingspan is 18 blocks (due to the angle its indeed 18 blocks i also used motorlock to pull them half a block into fuselage because as you know 18 has no middle)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:36:31 how many times do i have to explain whatever way my pc for some reason runs 20 fps when flying that plane and inevitablily after 10 seconds of flying it begins wobbling out of control at just 450 speed 1 graphics quality and im not exaggerating about the lag my pc just the definition of garbage and i dont know how to simply prove this fact because people seems to think its a complete lie, if it wasnt a lie i would be going around with overdetailed builds but i cant do that bc either its overdetailed or the build works (And i want to play not to look at my builds)
<@!487016674260680716> im indeed crying about it but im trying to prove the fact that i have a reason to cry about and apparently nobody believes that i do actually have a shit pc
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:44:02 yea not an excuse to build bro you are running 1.3k and going around 20 fps thats atleast something if i add so much detail to my plane it would be impossible to play with (its already obsolete for pvp because i cant aim its guns due to wobble atleast it flies) FOR YOU TO HAVE AN IDEA IM RUNNING 20 FPS (15 when recording) CONSTANTLY WOBBLING AND SOMETIMES LOSING CONTROL TO WOBBLE (LITERALLY) WHEN IN PVP SERVERS 
The reason i dont make better builds is because i want to play with my build not to stare at it endlessly because why would i build a plane if i cant fly it? (I CAN BARELY ALREADY FLY IT)
Ima edit this message soon to show a video unless the cooldown goes down in time https://streamable.com/tgt7oh
ALSO THATS ON A VIP SERVER ALONE, NOW IMAGINE A NORMAL SERVER AND NOW IMAGINE A PVP SERVER (i already described the fact that i lose control to wobble because it begins pitching up until its doing constant flips without stopping)
OHHH not to mention i have low fps and physics lag and a huge delay when firing rockets they go super slow and my torpedoes are super slow the lag LITERALLY lowers my speed on builds above 500 (not 5k my bad) blocks my monitor goes around 21 speed yet it feels like 9 i literally swim next to it normally without running and i outrun it
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:47:27 YES FINALLY SOMEONE WHO USES COMMON SENSE
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:50:17 i can literally do decent rotated motorlock its just that i cannot add it to a build without being unable to use it
also it want to atleast have a slightly decent look because whatever way the plane would wobble ass
also <@!869034105625534474>  they still dont understand the fact that bad pc means vehicle speed is lowered fps is lowered physics are slowered rockets and weapons are slowered tnt explosions are delayed wobble on planes is added and increased insanely control of certain stuff is lost and constant lag spikes means its hard to hit stuff and every other vehicle moves like if it was teleporting to your view (SO THATS WHY IM REPEATING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN)
im arguing about my pc, not the plane, i know the place sucks ass and has no detail but atleast the measurements are accurate
and the plane flies. Im arguing because as i said nobody fucking realizes what it actually is like to have a fucking bad pc because they arent the one facing the issues of hacing a shit pc
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:52:34 im arguing about my pc, not the plane, i know the place sucks ass and has no detail but atleast the measurements are accurate
and the plane flies. Im arguing because as i said nobody fucking realizes what it actually is like to have a fucking bad pc because they arent the one facing the issues of hacing a shit pc
<@!698587744842022983> your pc is MUCH BETTER THAN MINE CLEARLY you just said you can normally use a 1.3k block build with 20 fps my plane runs 15-20 fps and its just 370 blocks and it wobbles out of control most of the time and in pvp servers it goes as low as 10 fps and cant be controlled due to wobble
i will gladly stop but not until they accept the fact that my pc is the definition of sucks ass
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:55:03 if nobody gives a fuck then why you have to give feedback and telling me to add detail when i already explained i cant add detail and keep repeating every single second that i just should add detail no matter what
bro am i not allowed to have a plane that BARELY works? Or its just that you think i have a nasa quantum computer that can run a 100k block build at 240 fps? (now the last one was an exaggeration because probably not even with that you can understand my point)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:57:05 because..... thats literally the reason, anything wrong with saying the truth???? bro the plane is shit i tried and i want it to work, i just want people to understand: i make shitty builds because i cant make them better without making them unable to be used or even to crash my pc
Argument over im not gonna continue ill assume you guys gained sufficent iq to realize what having a bad pc actually is like
ALSO CRASH MY PC NOT AN EXAGGERATION IN PVP I HAVE A TANK AND A HELICOPTER BOTH AROUND 200-400 BLOCKS AND IF THEY ARE HIT IN THE MOTORLOCK MY PC CRASHES IT HAS LITERALLY HAPPENED TO ME AND STILL HAPPENS NO JOKE NO EXAGGERATION NO CAP (Well it doesnt really crash my pc but it crashes the game and makes my pc go slow as a snail refusing to work properly for a long while)
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:59:59 i said i was already going to stop, at this rate your attempting to increase the length of the argument or something
im out cya
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:19:21 I added detail to the p-47 cockpit just so people stopped saying that me saying i have a bad pc is an excuse to hide skill issues (because i can indeed add all that detail but my pc cannot handle it) also time to test if my p-47 still works or wobbles worse
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:22:55 Ok
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:25:23 thanks people just seems to hate everything i make because i defend my builds whenever they say theyre bad for something that i cant fix also <@!868410955653083137> idk that airship sorry not blimp looks good
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:27:29 true true it feels horrible when someone says my builds are disproportional by just looking at them when i literally measured them accurately for example, why criticize someone if you cant make it better or you dont really know what the build is truly like
using only what you say by looking at it once isnt accurate, an example is that i once did a submarine and i was gonna make it wide around 7-9 blocks but when measuring sizes it was requesting 5-6 width and it weirdened me so i decided to trust numbers and make it 6, but when i made the outline plan (i made it so i had a size refference to build) it looked far too thin but i continued, once it was done it actually looked normal and correct size

yes i am from colombia lol
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:30:20 i can handle criticism and many more people can but not when you are being rude or offensive when giving criticism OR when you are saying incoherent stuff and criticism is useless and sometimes rude when you just say "its bad" instead of explaining what you think is wrong
help 2022-04-05 16:57:31 How 2 get ranks (help)

creations-chat 2022-04-05 20:46:14 im lazy rn but i could use a lot of creations i got to get a few ranks
i have a 6000+ block aircraft carrier with around 228 blocks lenght i think i forgot actual lenght and its very tall (had to use motorlock for hull) and its around 33 blocks wide or smth bc of also motorlock to make deck overhang, i never finished it bc new worse pc so it doesnt have masts or details but ive folded it and made planes land on it several times
i got a lot of tanks and planes, i've got a (i think not colored yet) custom plane inspired off the he-111 with around 1000 blocks may be able to get aeronautical engineer III with it

creations-chat 2022-04-05 21:50:32 No that was in my previous pc and i literally cant make it move anymore and in my old pc it went like 5-10 fps and around 200 speed (i had to fit a billion engines) felt like 20 speed and the lag was unbearable so i had to anchor it bc moving around was laggy (even anchored it was 30 fps)
help 2022-04-06 00:47:51 Question
help 2022-04-06 00:47:59 i have a heli and it hovers with the propeller blades
help 2022-04-06 00:48:20 but to make it rise up or down i use propellers
help 2022-04-06 00:49:02 making the helicopter itself hover with the custom rotor sufficent for heli technician or it needs to rise up (not achieved), hover (achieved) and dive (not achieved) using only the rotor and no help from propellers
help 2022-04-06 00:50:15 its on an alt the heli is 100+ blocks too lazy to do it bruthu
help 2022-04-06 00:52:37 for a second i thought ur pvp was mr incredible but then i saw closer
creations-chat 2022-04-06 01:11:34 ill try because really i have not practiced angle lock a lot because i just cant do it often (laggy to add a lot of blocks)
Maybe when i get my new pc and i make a IAI Kfir (im planning to make one because its the current colombian air force fighter)
creations-chat 2022-04-06 17:09:36 that looks so smooth and cute, well the obvious is more wheels, you should add the top mg and the US star on the side
creations-chat 2022-04-06 23:48:01 Question is this scheme good for ships? And how about the tank one, and plane one? should i change it?
creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:34:35 please can someone tell me if the scheme is good or needs changes yet?
creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:37:57 doe is scheme good? scroll up a lil
creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:46:29 Someone, please answer this

creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:51:09 "my space is empty" Ok also your plane is unfinished on 1st pic and its finished on the other pic and it looks suspiciously similar to the tutorial b-17
creations-chat 2022-04-07 00:57:54 dude thats... super easy
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:27:30 i like how you used trails to give it a tiny angle effect at the end of the track overhang
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:55:37 i love how that tank uses suspension to aim
creations-chat 2022-04-11 15:37:14 Ive been revamping my monitor, this is the proggress on it so far, i finished funnels and turrets (i had to use piston lock so the recoil and elevation didnt jam) https://streamable.com/e1s2c9
creations-chat 2022-04-11 15:45:30 I have to unexpose motorlock and add the anchor & railing and ill be done
creations-chat 2022-04-11 15:51:42 bc im not done lol also theres no other details to add other than railing and anchor (For railing i will use trails and extensive motorlock instead of lazy ladders bc better detail and more accurate)
creations-chat 2022-04-14 01:53:52 is that british 1500 boat

creations-chat 2022-04-14 02:09:05 thats gonna be a hard fuselage tho it requires an angle down and an angle in from both sides
Should i start making it now?
creations-chat 2022-04-14 02:21:08 thx budder
creations-chat 2022-04-14 02:22:53 Wait but i need IAI Kfir c.10 because its the current one... whatever colombia used C.2 back then and theyre practicly the same, only a few technological differences

creations-chat 2022-04-15 00:32:04 my only guess is b-17 i am dumb
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:15:39 These are the measurements i need for the IAI Kfir C.10 im gonna make and some of them require piston lock so uh this is gonna be pain
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:18:39 why just whyy (if i make the canard able to move itll be a miracle and im gonna actually try to using motor 2 and texts bc its very very possible but it would require prob a huge 2 block long block wide 2 tall gap (wich is literally the fuselage height so uh prob will not be possible)
also <@375281006091173890> look at width and i gotta piston lock wing height
im making kfir bc colombian air force
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:21:01 necessary for accuracy i dont want it to look like a banana and having to restart it completely
Also my jet is gonna be 1.1 blocks wide in the nose <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:23:01 i dont know how to do that and it kinda makes the process 8 years longer and this is a good way to know if some stuff wont be possible without piston lock aka early requirement prediction wich allows me to know how much motorlock ill initially need instead of having to re-do everything thats in the motorlock just to expand it
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:24:47 i said i dont know how to do it, also with a pc this bad itd take 47 centuries and half
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:26:32 my p-47 is x1.3 of my main scale (my main scale is 1 block 0.9 meters) and that makes it around 1 block 0.7 meters wich is what you guys call roscale and my p-47 is 2 blocks wide <:trollface:775024642104229898> )
creations-chat 2022-04-15 18:31:27 no not really also exposed locks sometimes work for detail (look at the propeller)
also <@448677698773057547> i dont say its super accurate, i say its accurate and that blueprints cant always say otherwise because the 3d perspective of the plane doesnt work with the 2d perspective of the blueprint and i measured it through blocks, your eyes trick you because of 3d perspective, i once made a submarine and when measuring it with blocks the submarine turned out to be VERY thin, and i thought of making it wider and disobeying the numbers i got, i decided to leave it thin as how the numbers dictated and once finished it looked properly scaled, from that point on i always make stuff trusting the numbers (What im telling you is: i believe what i want because of the experiences i got)

creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:14:25 you can see the pigments and colors based on the shape of the pigments, you can see the cavities and recreate what sounds they did by blowing wind through said cavities just like how we and other animals cans, it can tell us how it moved, some fossils still have feathers or the print of ancient feathers hinting they existed remaining, etc
creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:16:48 yea but what we cant really tell saddly is thicker skin or hanging skin areas or of other materials like how chickens have, and we cant tell if some dinosaurs had feathers (other than the ones that have visible prints of existing feathers among the fossi)l or not and we cant find the colors of those feathers, but yea fossils can also tell us where muscles probably were located and what was the dinosaur's diet
creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:18:59 skin pigments, ofc not colors it can see we have no eye samples and none survived for such a long period, eyes are one of the first things that disappear on a dead body so on that part you were very right
creations-chat 2022-04-19 17:21:34 predators tend to see more colors than preys and preys see very little colors because all they do is eat leaves or stuff all day, except for ones that need to find fruits or fly

creations-chat 2022-04-19 23:37:24 i preffer 1 block 0.9 meters because it makes player 1.75 meters tall aka average height
i mean "roscale" is the same except the idea was spreaded and everyone accepted it because they thought it was accurate as it was the only by the time also thats because of the laziness and simplicity of making 1 stud be 1 feet

creations-chat 2022-04-20 13:40:41 pretty detailed tbh but the more i look at it the more i realize that it has exposed locks, subbing out stuff like rockets and huge wing gaps
creations-chat 2022-04-20 13:42:25 but hof is kinda decided by player upvotes so wo knows probably long ago or ppl just didnt pay attention to the build
creations-chat 2022-04-20 13:44:46 wow didnt realize the canopy was much bigger in the a-10 lol
creations-chat 2022-04-20 13:46:32 thats clearly ancient, motorlock and angle lock wasnt known yet prob and barely anyone used texts for details back then i think
creations-chat 2022-04-20 13:48:21 that was bc i took a first look but the more i look at it the more i realize its fucking shit probably what happened to the ppl who upvoted it all the way to HOF

creations-chat 2022-04-21 14:27:40 i never knew that those 2 were friends and he didnt act like it was a joke im not on this server 24/7 unlike you because plane crazy isnt my main game
creations-chat 2022-04-21 14:30:38 the way you called me a dumbass is just a way to provoke a response so you asked technically, <@685909594932773033> bud what if im not on in the correct times to realize that and whenever im here is only to post creations or check <#478584971670454284> or <#384025409945337856> and i barely do the last 2 mentioned and most of the time im also here arguing because people cant realize i dont analyze this server's contents closely because thats not what im here for
creations-chat 2022-04-21 14:32:49 then why do you get on an argument if you arent gonna read, you are basicly declaring you are giving up on the argument (aka i won)

Also i have school during 6 hours and half in the afternoon and most activity here occurs in the afternoon instead of the morning or night so....

If you dont read the opponent's argument you are literally just giving up on the argument then wich means you are letting the opponent win
creations-chat 2022-04-21 14:34:54 You still havent corrected above, thats the neat* part 
Ok then but im still not dumb for not knowing something im not here during long enough time to realize the first time i see it (because thats the actual first time i see those 2 dudes)

theres also zero hints of it being a joke or them being friends because people who dont know eachother tend to just insult eachothers' builds in the pcc as far as ive seen so why would those 2 specificly be friends, common sense does not have a play here

thats because im not that new, its just that i dont have 12 hours to be on this server every day plus the first time i see something doesnt mean the first time im on this server bro
creations-chat 2022-04-21 14:40:06 i do win that an idiot stops thinking that im a dumbass just because i dont notice something that is 0% obvious the first time i see it and them to rethink what they have done

creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:38:14 definitively no way to fix the specified problems without making it non rotational and making the gun motorlock less compact makes the gun itself longer
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:41:46 i dont want to make a too tiny gun because i need this to be pvp effective
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:46:58 <@792842138999980034> as compact as i can go (ill fix the issue of it looking like it floats later) only half as many guns as planned tho and just slightly more compact
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:48:43 previous design was 5.5 blocks long, this one is 4.5 blocks long, 1 block in lenght reduced, but 5 guns gone in sacrifice, and its also impossible to pull upwards (unless i make it offset thus inaccurate) and it will be hard to move it backwards without affecting landing gear position more than it already is and i dont want it to mess with cockpit seats bc i want to be able to get in and out
creations-chat 2022-04-28 17:52:10 even the most compact i can go, 1 gun, looks quite oversized and is terrible rotating, ill try another position for the gun
creations-chat 2022-04-28 18:49:20 https://streamable.com/hts4gr made a better gun but it costs being weak (only 4 guns)
creations-chat 2022-04-28 19:17:21 Heli fuselage looks shit and has exposed disconnectors but ik how to use those as detail
creations-chat 2022-04-28 19:19:18 This looks better
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:05:55 vadass <@456226577798135808> he said he wanted feedback before he made the turret bozo
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:10:40 didnt seem like a joke instead <@771407578285867108> 's one did clearly look like a joke, instead why dont you learn to sound sarcastic
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:14:00 even if theyre clearly detailed and hard efforted its just not up to the expectatives, wasted effort on the wrong details
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:15:49 sorry forgor efforted isnt a word im just dumb 💀
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:17:48 sorry 😦
creations-chat 2022-04-28 22:22:37 how does helicopter look so far its an apache ripoff (its not apache tho its ripoff!)
just needa stabilize it and color it
creations-chat 2022-05-06 17:51:32 Why is the bot dead? Any feedback for my tank?
creations-chat 2022-05-06 17:54:11 theres no space for tracks without making it 100 km tall and removing the sides, the camo needs work true i may mess with the colors later but adding another shade costs a lot of time because i gotta make a metal version for it that matches with the default version
creations-chat 2022-05-06 17:57:04 how could i make the camo better? add a middle shade? Ok thx
creations-chat 2022-05-06 17:59:56 Emojis do add detail to stuff and make it look good wich is what matters but that doesnt mean you can just spam emojis and do zero normal detail and use shit colors
So yea you are pretty much right
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:05:06 Colors any better?
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:07:15 selfie yes its a fard tank (Thats why its green)
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:11:32 tank if i explode tnt armor
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:31:41 the tank was freaking glitchy due to wheels requiring 2 motors to go forward and turn, the wheels permit the rocket to push it further without wheels the rockets would do nothing and without rockets the tank would go slow and unable to turn, no it does not defeat the whole purpose of wheels
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:33:42 its not about fitting it, its because it became super glitchy when it hit stuff and when it went fast and sometimes it just started twitching for no reason until it suddenly shooted itself at insane speeds and sometimes crashes my game
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:37:27 and doesnt go around sliding, and if i use friction fake treads it wont even move, i tried modifying suspension a billion times but it was all bc the tank was too heavy but if i made it too light the tank would go around literally flying because it was too light yet too powerfull and the wheels would anyway be too slow if i removed rockets bro it wont work.
i didnt?
creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:08:32 Im making a 1 block 0.9 meters scale airliner inspired off the 747 but overall its fictional, any feedback on the shape? No i wont angle lock the rear below because theres no space for it and its split in 2 parts for the rear, the plane has total 4 parts, and obviously the color isnt definitive
creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:12:01 this is how it looks unfolded for you to have an idea what i can add and what i cant, could pull it up 2 blocks so i may be able to fit a very painful to make angle lock in the nose but i already suffered with the one on the top
creations-chat 2022-05-11 15:23:24 This part here looks shit bc i dont want it to overlap with the windows, and i cant use a 1x3 or 1x4 wedge because it has to be half a block wide but idc really it isnt noticeable from a decent distance and its a tiny issue compared to all the stuff i gotta add to this plane
help 2022-05-11 15:26:04 probably you miscalculated the distances , why were those necessary tho?
help 2022-05-11 15:26:16 kinda
creations-chat 2022-05-12 14:32:29 made ugly tail after 10 years of suffering with angle lock
creations-chat 2022-05-12 15:28:10 Made tail after some suffering
creations-chat 2022-05-12 15:32:46 sparklers have big issues he may have to rotate it, save, load, and if it loads wrongly then try again until it loadss in the correct direction
creations-chat 2022-05-12 15:36:28 My airliner has a lot of that but i mean kinda justified because its MASSIVE it wont be easy to fit angle lock for that area and if i did, i may leave no space for wings wich i already have very little to do wings wich will require a lot of angle lock 

Honestly making the wings angle locked is more important than angle locking the nose and rear.

Also any feedback?
About the wings they have to be angle locked several times due to being split in folds, im also angle locking the engines so they look smooth, and im adding working ailerons and spoilers.
creations-chat 2022-05-12 15:39:17 theres really no way to fix without making it be square instead of round and that'd be worse tbh, and i cannot fit an angle lock for the rear due to reasons, about the nose... well that MAY be possible but ill figure that out once i have wings done (because i dont want to do it and it to turn out that i cant fit the wings thanks to it)
creations-chat 2022-05-12 15:43:50 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/974099331386867732 <@812516052851490857> wtf why are the engines angled out??? you could've not done them angled out by simply moving them more up and pull down with motorlock and to be connected with fuselage instead of wings
bug-reports 2022-05-12 15:47:38 how did you achieve this
bug-reports 2022-05-12 15:47:46 and why did rickje add inf speed
bug-reports 2022-05-12 15:48:07 tbh thats prob not true inf speed and he just added it as a joke for when ppl go far far too fast because inf speed would pretty much crash any computer
bug-reports 2022-05-12 15:48:13 (and really not possible)
creations-chat 2022-05-12 16:26:25 Nearly all 747 in creations have paper wings
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:09:33 has anyone noticed that when you drop your bombs into water or maybe all the time whenever you drop bombs, your plane loses stability suddenly like my planes used to be stable bombless but now that im playing rn they begin going around crazily like if they had not enough lift and had no rudder? when recording the vid i realized it happens after i turn on the camera (after having dropped bomb ofc) ill show a video of my torpedo bomber flying normally and when i turn camera nothing happens, but after i drop bomb and then turn camera it goes crazy https://streamable.com/joh4bt
context: my plane has enough wing panels to not go around like an object with barely any airfoils, and the rudder isnt strong enough to cause such insane yaw.
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:32:50 after a while the issue went away
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:35:48 the problem is still on for others tho
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:35:54 i saw a dive bomber go in circles crazily and then a jet
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:35:57 (after suffering no damages)
bug-reports 2022-05-17 00:36:09 just like how my planes did
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:09 No i dont mean that
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:13 its normal that it pitches up
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:16 im not talking about that
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:30 but after i turn on the camera, the plane acts like if it had no rudder and camera gets stuck in the air
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:33 yesterday i also saw;
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:40 a dive bomber spin in circles after it glitched
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:21:59 my attacker began spinning and ascended at insane speeds and i also realized the speed meter was stuck but it literally was going at about 5k speed and accellerating while spinning
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:03 after i dropped all bombs
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:09 but it didnt happen instantly
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:13 it happened a while after i dropped bombs
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:18 i also saw a b-17 glitch suddenly when i was chasing it
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:29 and fell into the void spinning similarly to how my attacker and the random dive bomber acted
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:40 idk man it happened yesterday in my server
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:44 idk if it was only on that server
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:50 i am talking about a glitch
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:55 im not ranting
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:22:56 read what i said
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:23:25 only in pvp i think tho
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:25:02 ok i recorded my attacker going nuts but not ascending crazy
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:25:06 ima try to make it ascend crazily after glitching

bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:30:34 it legit cant happen with internal hover drives or piston engines because it has none
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:30:41 it does not use engines to maneuver its fully control surfaces
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:30:48 and its ascending in one direction despite spinning
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:30:56 it never did that before
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:03 and it isnt the only plane of mine that suddenly became insane
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:08 and ive seen other people's planes go insane too
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:35 it never glitched like that before
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:40 and its happening in mass ever since yesterday
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:48 this plane is nearly half a year old
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:31:55 and yesterday was the first time this happens
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:04 and this is the weirdest way a plane can lose stability to "construction issues"
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:14 how does a plane ascend in a so stable straight direction while spinning
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:16 explain that to me
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:27 plus keeps accellerating
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:35 WHILE THE SPEED METER IS STUCK
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:38 and the camera goes stuck too
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:32:55 im posting this in bugs and not in help because i know it isnt an issue i can fix
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:33:06 i wouldnt be ranting about it if it wasnt a sudden bug
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:06 Ok recorded it on a diff plane (Thats even older)
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:28 altho it was recently modified to have hover drives unlike the attacker shown
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:36 https://streamable.com/3q1ssz
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:42 and its only happening on my planes that have bombs and a camera sight
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:46 watch the video
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:34:49 look at how it happens
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:35:03 the speed meter also goes stuck
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:35:11 and the plane begins spinning unusually as soon as the camera goes stuck
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:35:38 No, didnt you see how it suddenly spun crazily
bug-reports 2022-05-17 14:35:54 watch the plane stability at the start and then after the camera went crazy

plane-crazy 2022-05-17 15:45:55 i dont know why but plane crazy is sending me to some sort of russian server in pvp
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:19:35 How does this look? its a custom jet kinda based off the f-5, ill post it on creations once its done
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:22:20 ima post a vid
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:24:08 true prob my attempts to make it look diff from the f-5 made it look ugly specially using 1 engine and the ugly shaped intakes, ok heres vid https://streamable.com/i7dht8
its kinda mostly for pvp but i once again failed on making a jet that barely wobbles
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:40:22 the build in the background much better and smaller than ur under angle
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:43:43 i only do custom planes in my alts because theyre for a pcgm, didnt try to make an f-5 in the first place..
Also question for curiosity, what is the fastest vehicle (able to sustain its speed and be controlled) ever made by someone in plane crazy?
Also i have 7 alt accounts for plane crazy <:trollface:775024642104229898> but only 5 of them have vehicles the other 2 are still unused bc i dont need them yet
because i make a lot of stuff
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:46:15 i only said it was based off the f-5 so someone didnt say it was a copy of the f-5 or that it was a badly made f-5 but guess it didnt work
i already said why i need 7 alt accounts (i make a lot of stuff and 2 of them are on reserve) also it hurts to get rid of old creations
Ok then
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:51:24 but to be honest im terrible at making custom vehicles for some reason so i base my planes off something but they end up looking like either a failed version of the plane, a complete ripoff or like the actual plane wich is not the plan
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:53:42 this is an old plane i mad based off the stuka and it just looks like someone pooped over a stuka, the 2nd one is based off the a-1 skyraider and it just looks like it had the same fate as the one based off the stuka, and the 3rd one i atleast managed to make a somewhat original shaped fuselage and wings but overall it looks like a ripoff of the he-111
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:56:27 i repeat im just bad making custom planes so i copy off actual planes and they end up looking like failed versions 😦 https://streamable.com/wsvoif the plane in the vid looks a bit more original but its also a ripoff i think of the mig-15 i forgot what i based it off theres a lot of planes that look like that
also not really thats just the pcgm scheme but jet fighters and tanks have a diff scheme, im too lazy rn to change plane scheme bc id have to fix a hella ton stuff but i may do it some day prob to be same as the tank scheme but with the belly color
creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:58:53 heres tank scheme may look good on planes also thanks for not saying its brown or poop color bc thats literally what everyone has told me and why i changed the old scheme but its still trash and i may have to change it yet another time
creations-chat 2022-05-19 17:02:02 typical private jet how does it look (in my opinion its shitty and basic but its fun to use) https://streamable.com/q9koa4
Would've made it 2 blocks wide but it would've been impossible to move in the interior and it would've been a smaller scale so prob harder to do and i wanted it to be quick to make bc i was in a rush and i just wanted it so i could have fun flying it

btw i may make a custom space shuttle for my fictional plane crazy nation because why not (im basing it mostly off buran because yes buran funny but ill do as many differences as i can)
creations-chat 2022-05-19 17:15:22 yes yes yes yes also <@595372385121730586> ik that but i was too lazy to fix it
creations-chat 2022-05-19 17:18:42 better than anything i can make currently
creations-chat 2022-05-19 23:59:12 yea i agree that deck III sucks ass in the 1st video i thought it had angle locked wings, elevators and rudder like my airliner based off the 747 (its looking too similar to 747 and im trying to find an engine design different from the 747 so it isnt literally the same any help with that btw?) but in the 2nd video i realized it has paper thin wings 💀 also thats a fucking badass f-16
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:01:21 would a 747-like airliner get HOF if it has angle locked wings? maybe i could try apply HOF if i ever finish it
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:03:20 (it will prob suck ass tho and im trying to make it not accurate to the 747 because i was just trying to copy the 747 to make a custom plane for my fictional nation thingy but it just looks far too similar and im still trying to figure out a different engine layout that isnt 2 engines thats why i havent continued with the wings it also has some exposed locks that i may fix later if i have space)
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:05:03 managed to find a picture of it im too lazy to get a new one rn also i will indeed try to do the gears, all the surfaces to be able to move and make the spoilers work and make all the doors functional, my private jet was a test for the possible door system
also its on 1 block = 0.9 meters scale bc it makes the player 1.8 and im used to that scale
and yes nose sucks ass if i manage to finish wings and engines and i have space i may angle lock it
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:07:44 funny looking fold failure (you can see the rest of the angle lock in rudder, elevators and the top bulge)
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:22:09 f-88 (greatest fighter jet of world war 4)
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:54:25 yes it has a lot of cheese grater i may angle lock it if i get space for it once wings and engines are done
creations-chat 2022-05-20 14:25:05 poopy plane
creations-chat 2022-05-20 15:15:10 the elevators are high up so it doesnt look like the f-5 (its inspired off the f-5 but its meant to be custom) and <@720891502108344360> fictional nation i made 💀 it sucks ass rn tho
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:49:24 https://streamable.com/oj7qdz 10k speed, ill try to reach 20k, 20k is my goal

creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:05:39 that tank looks badass bro i once made an ugly t-55 and it looked like that but it had zero angle lock and good detail and it was smaller but this truly looks godly for such a small size lol (Color was nearly the same too and its also gone)
btw did i break the speed record in plane crazy with my 24000 speed plane? (speed record of a controllable stable plane)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:09:07 GOD IT ACTUALLY GETS TO 27850 OUT OF RECORDING but i managed only to record 26000 idk how i got to 27.8k https://streamable.com/xijlj0 
the key is to make it VERY long and VERY wide but yet have very little wing panels and to be nearly perfectly balanced (cant make it bigger due to plot limits)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:24:36 New record: 28800 https://streamable.com/dldzuv
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:26:36 but you probably got it with helium or glitching wildly, this is the highest speed ive reached on a controllable plane, im not talking about randomly reached speeds also i just got it to 28.9k with a new upgrade but too lazy to record
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:36:39 <@416889976337465346> that mini titanic is INSANE also <@456226577798135808> if you realize his titanic is far beyond yours, its hyperdetailed despite being tiny look at how tiny it actually is
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:44:02 actually if you look at the trail and block sizes its about 3 blocks but still (funnels are a full block) very VERY impressive
creations-chat 2022-05-21 16:52:42 <@475239686407847946> i was bored and decided to make an overworked airliner to my skill level and im now more bored and with something that i have no motivation to do but i have to somehow do it because theres some unexistent pressure pushing me to do it
creations-chat 2022-05-21 16:54:29 this is pain, wing so far (ill remove exposed locks later thats just a temoral motorlock tower im working on the angled part's motorlock first)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 16:56:59 the reason its so hard is that i have to fold it completely to see if something i added worked wich means i gotta do it for nearly every block i place so i know it looks well and i can continue and im tryna figure out a way to make the next angle wich is why i havent worked on the back of the wing
Also i gotta work on the top part that doesnt angle of the wing and remove the exposed locks or i will be stuck without knowing what to do next so yea its time to fix the exposed locks and do the top part, ill focus on finishing first fold and figuring out how to fit the landing gear thats at the wing wich i sure think is possible because theres no motorlock or stuff blocking it, it just needs a small gap below where the landing gear fits wich would also be acurate
after i finish wings if i have space (pretty sure ill have it but just incase im not right i wont add it yet) ill angle lock the nose
creations-chat 2022-05-21 16:59:01 Its not too steep lol i measured the angle but idk if you can do the favor compare it with a 747 blueprint (would help me a lot)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:01:09 cant, reason; too compact and itd require too much camera lock and camera lock connects to seat and i have to motorlock said angles, and i cant do the same for 2 wings because theyre angle locked inwards so theres no gaps in the side of the body, if you know how camera lock works you'd know what im talking about
Also its much easier but it requires the space for the camera lock to be cleared wich means it cant be compacted and it connects to seat so you cant motorlock it unless you motorlock the seat but that means motorlock on one direction, cant do 2 opposite wings for example motorlocked into the plane <@714878625484243101> (unless you motorlock seat up so the wings are already into the inside but that cant be done with such a gigantical plane)
Also angle lock is pro
if exposed motorlock was a race this server would be considered racist
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:02:53 pc2 will allow overlapping and angling blocks in build mode? or you just mean he will remove the glitches
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:04:36 dumb rod that got stuck in tail during folding also exposed locks but 🤫
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:07:29 dumb underdetailed hole to make lights work on plen (if i find space to place it, i may detail it later with some angle lock but im overall not gonna angle lock the rear of the plane because theres no space already unless i somehow find space (After finishing everything including landing gear and interior tho unlike nose wich is planned to be agle locked if i finish wings and still have space for landing gear at the front because (2nd image) the gear is where the angle is at wich means i need to do some work but i already did a test for self made landing gear that can hide with trapdoors so it wont be such a big issue (i think i showed it here it was some sort of fighter)
this already uses FJKZ for holding cant wait for the folds at nose and if i ever do it on rear to make it up to LÑZX also landing gear will require 2-4 keys and lets not talk about the plane doors or the engine folding if i ever do
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:09:38 then why didnt u do the folding the most perfectly u could for the picture bc ofc the plane isnt always gonna fold perfectly but atleast try it for the image bro thats what i did when i posted my p-47
(shit costed you a downvote lmfao)

Oh
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:11:31 idk bro i was just asking a question
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:15:40 itd just become build a boat 2 tho
needing to motorlock, angle lock, piston lock, camera lock and the effort required is what makes pc unique so im guessing rickje is keeping that
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:18:10 green line is rudder.... No i dont think so its actually less far behind than it should (made green line longer than image in the 2nd image because the rudder wasnt taken completely in the image) but im not fixing that bc this is meant to be a different plane to 747 because i like to do custom planes but i also like to ripoff irl planes (talking about that any ideas to do different engines bc i need more differences or i would aswell give up and make it just be a 747 idk lol)
WAIT I RE READ WHAT YOU SAID lemme check if thats right
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:19:55 idk man i cant notice the difference off from here bc theyre differently angled and not fused (The images) plus the wing is heavily wip but if you can send proof of it itd help a lot
creations-chat 2022-05-21 17:21:47 the ingame image isnt same size as the blueprint that was just a fast image so thats not a decent comparison just fuse the images and check idk if ur right or wrong but i want to be sure because thats a quite raw assumption
<@938196250791141386> first of all give it longer wings please
creations-chat 2022-05-21 20:19:47 some shitty scheme for an acrobatic group that operates in the fictional nation thingy i have
i call them the firebeaks (blue angels ripoff btw)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 20:22:25 fixed it
creations-chat 2022-05-21 20:55:55 changed color bc it looked ugly before (I just swapped them around lol)
i just realized something already had made a similar scheme before (moment)
theyre called firebeaks so i thought making nose orange instead of black looked more fitting not saying the old scheme was bad
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:00:32 a small fix on rudder
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:02:15 no thats an already existing scheme and it needs to have orange but yea white may look more fitting
OK NVM WHITE MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A GOOSE
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:07:29 how does this look (z fighting ik this is just a test) it looks so silly to me
not an f-5 its inspired off it but it has clear differences like the height of the elvators and the fact that it has one engine and the nose looks shit
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:11:51 me waiting for the downvotes to rain down:
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:15:07 i based it off the f-5 and this is the first time i hear of that plane
Fuck
also it looks like an f-5 with one engine like what i intended my plane to be like (Why)
it kind of is just an f-5 with one engine doe
yea i researched its just an attempt to make better f-5
oh also thanks
im copyrighting the US!!!!!!!1 (my plane is meant to be 1964!!!)
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:20:26 block 0
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:22:10 this variant looks like the designer forgot to angle lock the things at the sides
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:32:35 yea but its made by a different company for a different nation there are many fighters with similar designations but from different companies
ALSO WHY IS IT SO FAT AND FUNNY LOOKING
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:34:18 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F-32 an example of a plane with the same designation but a different company
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:36:43 as a concept (for production but the prototype existed, and it was called x-32) it exists tho but my point stands i can name my plane whatever i want as long as its made by a different company that isnt one that already used that designation
bug-reports 2022-05-21 21:39:31 that happens to me but only when im about to lose connection
bug-reports 2022-05-21 21:39:36 chat also doesnt work and
bug-reports 2022-05-21 21:39:42 other stuff
bug-reports 2022-05-21 21:39:47 but that happens right before im about to lose connection so
bug-reports 2022-05-21 21:39:52 doesnt happen always so not big issue for me
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:40:28 that was kind of for gjsoloblock too not only for you
and <@389516889501728779> yea kinda true but like i have no other ideas for naming them and i require a basic consistence in my plane naming
creations-chat 2022-05-21 21:48:54 i need to use f-31 for a planned plane, same for f-27, f-28, and ive already used f-29 and f-34 and f-38
and i plan to use the rest of the names
the lower numbers like f-5 f-6 f-7 and stuff are for interwar planes, f-1 f-2 f-3 for ww1 planes and other stuff and i used some and will use around f-10 for ww2 planes and f-20 and around for cold war jets
all of them fighters
all of them designed by firecrest
consistency
creations-chat 2022-05-21 22:52:00 yes also the nozzle can become thinner but it significantly reduces speed ingame
creations-chat 2022-05-22 22:35:38 i found someone using a hindenburg with the non appropiate german symbols of ww2 in pvp and i realized reports cannot be done anymore
creations-chat 2022-05-22 22:38:42 sucks ass tbh

creations-chat 2022-05-24 15:59:13 Im gonna make a fictional (almost) mach 2 airliner for my fictional nation thing https://streamable.com/9w506k
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:37:15 https://streamable.com/eynjp0 Proggress on nose, any feedback?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:41:44 it sucks ass yes but atleast it works and im running out of space to add more stuff thats why im not motorlocking anything else i barely could add the rest of the snoot now imagine trying to angle lock it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:44:45 it does explain the sides, i said i barely have space for motorlock in the nose because it needs to have an interior and it already has costed so far having exposed locks inside, and uh idk what the mobile windshield thing is for but i think its for better aerodynamics during supersonic flight and the droop snoot is to have better view during landing and its so tiny i cannot fit any more angle lock, atleast i could fit that for the windshield

im also gonna stick to the fact that it atleast works, im not removing the droop snoot just to make the nose angle locked i worked hard on it and i like it

i just made the plane to have fun flying at around 1800 speed

with a slightly decent looking plane ofc
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:46:46 i identify as morbidly/obese/sus
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:49:27 uh about the sides if you mean the sides of the fuselage theyre kind of blocky because of limitations and no space for angle lock and i already said it, and im not saying im making the plane "realistic" im saying im adding that because on actual supersonic planes like the tupolev 144 and the concorde they added that windshield PROBABLY to reduce drag wich is what i think because i havent researched at all but it makes the cockpit glass more sloped and im thinking that because of this image and im anyway too lazy to research

What im saying is that im stupid and i just want to have fun with a funny supersonic plane, not here saying im a smartass nerd
creations-chat 2022-05-24 16:52:01 can you just stop the argument, this is a server to talk about dumb builds in **lego: the official videogame**, not here to talk about how 50 year old femboys who hide in their mom's basement identify as xa/xe

i agree <@793652610171011082> but its still funny to have among/us as my pronouns

thats what im asking <@456226577798135808> lol
k gtg cya
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:09:52 my pronouns are sus/amogus/mor/bius
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:15:41 please shut up this is a server to talk about a lego game about making bad quality planes to get free downvotes, not lgbtq discussion central
we dont have to learn about genders and orientation because we already know that stuff exists and we dont really actually care or find interest and we find it silly because it makes no natural sense bro atleast gay lesbian and bi make sense but bro wth theres stuff like dreamattraction (im replacing a word i cant say with attraction) why does that exist? and thats the reason we just dont really freaking care and even dislike neopronouns, neogenders and neoattractions.

And yes its not brainwashing but it starts to become misleading, annoying and overwhelming i dont feel like my future generations having to learn about 1 trillion pronouns and 5 billion genders that some random internet depressed ppl had to make because they needed to feel more "special"

<@720024036863901717> shut up y/n?
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:18:14 lego female pfp 🤢 🤮
<@370594904268734464> ik and im tryna stop it but <@720024036863901717> is unable to shut up about it
true, Ok
creations-chat 2022-05-29 21:14:58 sound speed airliner nose that i wont angle lock more bc well i cant (it moves) also it has big hole when it moves but i cant fix that
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:19:52 https://streamable.com/cugsib how does this look so far (i need to angle lock wings somehow, somehow also add 6 doors, and somehow also make it go 1900 speed)
sometimes misfolding by a tiny bit due to pistons can cause some stuff to jam either temporarily or permanently so uh i either respawn or slam the plane into something
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:23:43 interior (sucks ass and has some z fighting but it atleast makes it look like i tried)
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:26:07 proggress so far, the green line is the lenght, the red line is the wing lenght, the skin color line is the back part before wing back starts, wich just basicly means this thing will be a pain to fold
<@709400929178222711> ive seen Lost in Space and no i think its fine but you should've given an aerial view for a better idea and <@793132196810588200> ERASE HIM
<@456226577798135808> 😱
people when making 747's: haha only 2 fuselage parts (1 fold)
people when making concordes: no folding
me, who measuring, needed 1 more fold in both similarly sized aircraft: look at what they need to mimic a fraction of our power
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:28:12 it actually looks very accurate
also im gonna name my plane the machliner and its gonna be a concorde ripoff for my fictional nation in the 80s!!!! (not gonna be rushed like tu-144!!!)
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:30:56 did you keep the old ones? because old builds give nostalgia, the only reason to delete them would be space tbh and i never erase my first of something, i kept my first flying plane, i kept my first vtol plane, kept my first helicopter, etc
just an opinion idk what other people feel like old builds some may even feel angered towards them for some reason yknow how people works
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:36:36 i didnt find the word so i just said angered towards them for some reason but thats kinda what i meant, embarassment etc as a reason to not like old builds it makes some people feel bad and theres people who dont like to remember when they werent good at something for reasons
creations-chat 2022-05-31 00:45:42 i had a fucking ugly plane that looked nearly like that, it had the same fatness but the cockpit was less fat so was nose but nose still expanded by a wing panel, the wing was shaped like a modern fighter jet, the jet overall had a fuselage super fat in comparison to wingspan and it had extremely bad custom control surfaces and thrust vectoring that constantly jammed (Wich is why i deleted it recently) here are pictures of it
creations-chat 2022-05-31 01:08:41 sach's pear ion or shake spear ion or shakes pierre ion
<@908653367075692555> where exposed lock i see none!!!!
creations-chat 2022-05-31 15:26:49 pline
creations-chat 2022-05-31 15:48:30 would require yet another motorlock layer and using blocks permit to see the exterior from the interior and i like it more than fake windows tbh
creations-chat 2022-05-31 16:07:55 how does plane look so far, red is kinda what its meant to look like in the future (sorry for drawing so badly lmao)
4/6 doors done
2/6 angle locks done (may cancel the idea of angle locking the rear)
folds done
1/2 fuselage parts done
interior is finished
nose angle tends to jam sometimes so do doors but that is caused by folding faults
help 2022-05-31 16:51:00 Ok so this is the plane so far i finished wing layout (finally) (the wings look kinda short at the end bc i left a 2 block space behind for the control surfaces so i kinda drawn in red how itd look like)
creations-chat 2022-06-01 14:55:57 WTFFFFFFFFF I ACCIDENTLY MADE MY PLANE GO 10K SPEED AND NEARLY STABLE LMFAOOOO https://streamable.com/pztss2
creations-chat 2022-06-01 15:18:46 made my plane stable and fly and its fun to use, i hate how it lands but its also funny by the way so idk also it is speed
saddly due to landing gear being locked motors and not motor 2 (because motor 2 landing gear try to twitch out during high speed) i have to anchor to put them out and in and uh theyre not that synced wich is a big issue https://streamable.com/7wvmcf
i still have to add back doors and the intakes & thrusters, also gotta add back thrust and forward thrust for taxiing and taxiing sideway motors ofc
creations-chat 2022-06-01 16:02:33 This plane lands like shit and its hard to actually land it properly (and landing it properly it still looks shitty bc of how it ends up angled upwards thanks to the propellers that stabilize it during droop snoot landing) https://streamable.com/uw6i3e
creations-chat 2022-06-01 16:08:13 plane overall tends to malfunction a lot and its shitty to land and its still wip so imagine, it could be unstabilized once its fully finished and id have to redo the entire flight system, but overall its fun to go so fast but id honestly barely use it
would be worth it to attempt to get a HOF with it but prob not possible and it looks quite blank outside and the only thing ill try to detail will be tail with a large parrot icon but may not even do it so idk
diff color schemes may make up for the blankness

general 2022-06-05 03:16:21 Question, where can i advertise a pcmg in this server without breaking the rules? or its completely forbidden
general 2022-06-05 03:16:49 my friend told me they advertised their server here
creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:23:43 lol for a second i thought this was a diff game, but yea its quite clearly plane crazy and the more i look at it the more basic i notice it is (AS IN THE MAP NOT THE TANK the tank is kinda better than anything i can make)
general 2022-06-05 03:27:24 so, is it possible to advertise plane crazy military groups here or completely forbidden
general 2022-06-05 03:27:47 or advertising rule is just as in for discord servers
general 2022-06-05 03:28:16 like, plane crazy groups for battling and stuff like fictional or non fictional nation things

general 2022-06-06 15:02:00 hes advertising a pcmg

general 2022-06-06 15:04:17 so do we tell a mod?
general 2022-06-06 15:06:57 that was 4 days ago and all i want is to know if i can advertise my pcmg here or i would break a rule
general 2022-06-06 15:07:06 so against the rules or not?
general 2022-06-06 15:07:10 Ok thanks

general 2022-06-06 15:07:38 why are they so similar
general 2022-06-06 15:08:36 they look like one copied the other tho lol
general 2022-06-06 15:08:44 also i think the turrets cant rotate
general 2022-06-06 15:08:52 ik it isnt copy
general 2022-06-06 15:08:56 prob just same scale but it looks like they were copied
general 2022-06-06 15:09:05 so similar
general 2022-06-06 15:09:15 L
general 2022-06-06 15:09:26 yes
general 2022-06-06 15:09:52 GUYS WHO WANTS TO JOIN MY AMONG US MILITARY GROUP ONLY AMONG US TANK ALLOWED YOU GOTTA BE NOT SUSSY!!!1!1!
general 2022-06-06 15:09:54 (joke)
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:34:38 How does this cockpit look, i will angle lock the back, its meant to look like a 5th generation fighter jet
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:38:42 piston locked seat so it doesnt overhang
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:41:44 cockpit meant to look kinda like this, should make the angle at the back less exaggerated, and completely lower seat thatd be better
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:44:02 i saw your tank, to be honest it is terrible but theres improvements, for such a big tank you could add several features like secondary turrets, the main gun is unrealistic you could replace it with a large howitzer something sort of like the schwerer gustav, and add some scaffoldings around and a watch tower maybe and dont make it look so futuristic it makes it look less decent, you could do a style similar to the image below
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:46:16 idk what that tank is tbh!!!! i just found image and thought it would fit for the design and <@426393733391581186> im not asking for you to make it the same just like to use a similar style, more exposed treads, a large cannon, less modern looking etc
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:55:07 this is the cockpit so far, im gonna put something at the back so no thats not the definitive look, its meant to look like the 2nd image, also im not making a su-75 im gonna make a custom plane inspired off it and the f-35
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:57:10 changed angle slightly idk if the difference is noticeable but the back part now angles down more and the front part angles down less, its also possible to get out and in, also sir im not gonna expand the back because ill put something behind there like in the image below, itll be another angle lock that angles very slightly but enough to lower a whole half block off from the height of the part where back cockpit angles down suddenly
creations-chat 2022-06-06 15:59:38 he prob will move it when hes close to being done and fix it idk pros are wild

probably use the exposed locks as detail, yknow i tend to do that also it could be used to put texts and others
creations-chat 2022-06-06 16:05:07 actually he can hide them before tail angles too much KINDA bc its a curve not a direct angle, question is the way he will do it
general 2022-06-06 16:17:11 i added a suggestion is it dumb or decent?
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:26:48 what is this? ik its an old message but i found it when looking at random private jet related messages for curiosity
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:26:53 looks quite interesting
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:29:49 wait did i ping a person that i shouldnt ping?
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:29:51 oh no
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:29:59 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:32:25 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:32:28 i just said why tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 16:32:34 "ik its an old message but i found it when looking at random private jet related messages for curiosity"
general 2022-06-30 23:36:55 how to suggest again?
general 2022-06-30 23:37:04 ok
creations-chat 2022-07-01 17:40:17 working on a plane thats inspired off the f-111 (i wanted to make a variable geometry wing for my nation that wasnt a copy of the f-14) and im calling it korella (cockatiel in russian because it sounds cool)

how does the cockpit look so far? im gonna add some piston lock to fill in the gap at the middle of the cockpit and im gonna use angle lock to finish the lines around the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-07-01 17:48:19 decided to be lazy (god that looks terrible should i just do the angle lock? id need 2 of them and one of them has to be piston locked tho)

even if you do it in reverse it would count as referencing the symbol
creations-chat 2022-07-01 22:50:52 took a while of suffering
creations-chat 2022-07-02 02:22:12 how does this look so far?

trapdoors so i can get out (adds extra suffering but i atleast could add more cockpit lines and if u mean for the wing start its uhh i dont want the plane to have too many wing panels so it can go fast without many hovers bc more hovers = lag)

also should i close the gap in the cockpit?
creations-chat 2022-07-02 02:24:45 should i close this gap? i dont think it would be kinda necessary to cover its a kinda insignificant detail and im kinda lazy to cover it but if its really such a big deal i already have a plan on what i can do
creations-chat 2022-07-02 02:29:10 thats close to closing the gap, a bit of piston lock will do
creations-chat 2022-07-02 02:32:13 closed it enough now theres just 2 tiny insignificant gaps

i wanted to make a fictional variable geometry wing plane so im uh kinda inspiring off the f-111
i have never made a fighter with side to side seats so thats why i chose f-111 for the inspiration and im calling this korella (cockatiel in russian)

also i agree
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:29:00 how does this look? digging a bit i realized i need to do piston lock for the sides of the cockpit in order to make a small passageway interior so the variable geometry wings can slide inside, im also gonna find a way to close the gap in the landing gear bc rn there appears to be no space for it surprisingly, yea im using premade for the front one bc theres no space for a custom one right below the seats but the ones at the back will be custom
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:32:33 done
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:38:05 i kinda like it tho other than the cheese grater and its also massive despite of being 1 block 0.9 meters scale lol
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:40:26 nah its fine i already suffered enough with the cockpit and uh i dont think theres even space unless i destroy the entire under part wich im too lazy for bc im already doing far proggress on the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:42:40 and im uh using premade small landing gear bc the plane im basing it off (f-111) also has very smol landing gear and on the 2nd imagine im leaving an open line there bc of the swing wing ill make it less long depending on when im more finished

altho the ones at the back will be custom

im finding rn a way to fit them
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:48:15 looks so silly lol
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:53:40 this looks much better
creations-chat 2022-07-02 14:57:00 https://streamable.com/uioxt7

will try to angle lock some trapdoors down there so the gap in the back landing gear can be closed, i gtg, next thing ill do would be add the thrusters wich will be also angle locked and then do the elevators and rudder, last things id do would be the wings, propellers for maneuverability bc theyre better to maneuver at low speeds and taxiing (Except for roll i wont do roll ones bc they cant be hidden well) and will add the hover thrusters that hopefully can power the plane without high amounts

bug-reports 2022-07-02 23:38:38 Guns kinda stopped working in pvp, ive been on diff servers and you see your enemy aim at you with turrets but guns arent firing and i asked someone if i damaged them when i fired guns

bug-reports 2022-07-02 23:38:42 when i was
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:29:04 These wings are a test, i may find a way to angle lock them so they look better bc rn theyre just blank and smooth in the front and uh theres a huge gap in their back https://streamable.com/8hf5x0
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:35:15 made a better version of the wings but the angle looks too far and theyre kinda too thin, opinions? https://streamable.com/pkrb1t
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:39:50 i made angle lower to fix the angle issue but now as i remove an inconsistency in the wing, another one appears
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:42:40 does this weird thing look worse, better, or even cool? also it has sickened me enough im making the wings thicker as a test

tested thicker wings and i just couldnt make them fit
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:48:48 made the slight angle cut less noticeable
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:51:00 found why thicker wings wouldnt fit and made them fit, does it look good?

custom plane
creations-chat 2022-07-03 00:56:03 inspired of f111 but yea im blatantly copying it and im giving no credit!!
creations-chat 2022-07-03 01:09:13 Plane shape so far how does it look? https://streamable.com/5z8vjb (ill fill in the elevators) the part with half wedges is kinda temporal may replace it with something and ill make a thicker base below the rudder
creations-chat 2022-07-04 00:58:11 the nose kind of is 1 wide and if not 1.5 wide, and i once made a 1 block = 0.9 meters scale plane that was strictly inspired off the f-16 for the dimensions and it ended up with the fuselage looking oversized even despite the fact i made it like 2-2.5 blocks wide at widest point (middle) and the nose was 1 block wide

so on the typical 1 block = 0.77 meter scale well i doubt making the nose 2 wide would look correct at all

lemme find an image it also looks shit and its not an f-16 i said it was inspired off the f-16 for specifications like speed and size and part of the shape
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:00:23 yea its mid ik very basic but even with having a 2.5 or 2 block wide overall fuselage i had to extend wingspan bc it looked silly
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:12:47 so yea i dont think the f-16 should be considered a 2 block wide nose when ro-scale

(because my plane wich was slightly smaller scale to ro-scale looked silly and had to have its wingspan expanded even with a 1 block wide nose and 2 blocks wide overall fuselage)
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:17:58 pooplane so far
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:29:09 ok but wait bc im tryna do the angle lock for the landing gear below stuff, i managed to do it but its blocking the wings a bit and i found space to do it so i gotta redo it

actually theres no space
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:32:54 here is a vid i finished the landing gear trapdoors they have to go inside to avoid clipping with the landing gear itself, as you can see a piece got stuck at the spine that sometimes happens and it may be avoided when the plane can move doing something i call spinny folding for now may do a video of what im talking about later https://streamable.com/2aiifl
creations-chat 2022-07-04 01:35:20 Spinny folding (basicly i do it so the plane doesnt get parts of the folding assist structure stuck but it also looks cool) https://streamable.com/422ztj

sometimes parts do get stuck despite of the spinny folding but it works most of the time
help 2022-07-04 01:37:28 uhhh sorry to disappoint you no its not even despite of the massive size you are uncapable of doing basic details like making the nose look good or hiding motorlock.....

and due to how massive it is you may have problems fitting it in the plot i recommend to make a smaller detail low plane and slowly add detail whenever you make a new plane
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:02:59 I HAVE MADE AN ATROCITY PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO FOR CONTEXT https://streamable.com/1wirr8
creations-chat 2022-07-04 02:05:15 top gun 3 released footage (please watch the video)
creations-chat 2022-07-04 20:54:32 they do if no tracks then its just an armored car OR a tank that can go without tracks but tanks that can go without tracks are tanks that do HAVE TRACKS but are designed to be able to move if they lose them (but having no tracks means worse traverse thru rough terrain) and also the da vinci tank is not a tank its just an armored carriage and the real true tank invention was when the ones made for ww1 were made, and they were only called tank because of anti-spionage naming, not anything else, so if tanks had been invented before they'd be named differently, so cant change my mind over why a tank can only be a vehicle with tracks made after ww1

so please dont call an armored car a tank just name it a futuristic armored car
creations-chat 2022-07-04 21:01:55 bro thats so fucking amazing i used to make detailed ships but i dont anymore bc lack of motivation, ships truly can be masterpieces in this game im sad i dont have the motivation to make one

creations-chat 2022-07-31 19:50:00 without its wings, can anyone guess what is this based off
creations-chat 2022-07-31 19:56:47 actually based off draken tho you fr got it right wtf
its gonna be a ripoff tho not draken and im gonna make wings look like stealth aircraft wings for the sake of it not looking that much like a draken ripoff lol

the focus of the plane is making thick and angle locked wings instead of detailing fuselage
creations-chat 2022-07-31 20:42:33 wtf bro stop doxxing me
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:24:16 Plane pretty much done, it just needs painting and some stabilization fixes (wtf all of my planes have small assymmetrical stuff but that doesnt alter stability yet in this one it seems to roll super slowly to a the left and the weird part is that the assymmetrical weight is in the right)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:27:29 the weight of the plane is assymmetrical slightly, but its mostly centered to the right and not to the left, yet it seems to yaw to the left with no reason, and i have found no wing panels or heavy weight alterations on the left
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:29:40 plane in a darker shade (now detail is visible)
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:01:19 i finished it its not that good but i tried the focus was to do good wing angles in a small plane

yes its a one block wide plane cope, its much easier to do detail on the fuselage surface if its 1 wide and it was meant for good wings not for a good fuselage the fuselage is ass i have to admit it has several gaps too
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:03:37 exposed motorlock :dies:
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:07:21 moved the stars slightly so they were more visible on the wings

<@784038374494306304> PCC members trying to not bully others for making an oversized abomination of a tank, a 1 block wide plane or a shit build in general:

also i know i just felt like fixing that bc the star was overlapped by the bit of exposed motorlock in the sides of the fuselage

creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:11:38 idk man my 3rd time trying to make thick angled wings and my first time doing it on a tiny plane

my first time was on an airliner thats still unfinished ive shown it before and my 2nd time was on a concorde ripoff thing thats also still wip idk why i havent finished them

also <@878809539858804767> tik tok builds <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>

theyre not failed creations im just too dumb to make a plane design of my own so i copy real life designs and add tiny differences

in the draken the sides of the wing are flat for less length and the intakes arent a 45 degree angle inwards
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:14:33 too lazy may do another plane with a similar focus on detailed wings next time or just finish my airliner

<@784038374494306304> No because theyre not real life planes and ur copying my designs 😦
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:16:46 like, i make custom planes for i gotta admit im too fucking lazy to try and make an accurate plane and i dont even try to make them irl planes in the first place, but also because i have some sort of fictional nation thingy and i dont want it to be using irl planes because idk i want it to have its own planes

also no im not deleting it i wanna see how many downvotes i can see

and im not saying the build isnt shitty im saying im too lazy to not make it shitty so im just not gonna make it not shity

why are we even arguing we all have the same opinion my plane is poop
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:20:52 all of them are true except for the eurofighter thats actually based off the delta dagger except with canards and the jf-17 wtf are you talking about and the f-111 ripoff (corella) doesnt have a flat canopy and doesnt have thrust vectoring 

<@784038374494306304> im not wondering why i get criticism if im sentient my plane is shit im also sentient it being shit is the reason its getting criticism, at this rate you people are running out of excuses to start and continue arguments

(wtf why did i put f-16 after the eurofighter i didnt mean to put that)

the purpose of the f-111 ripoff was to make a variable geometry wing plane and a detailed canopy
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:25:05 and thats good bc its meant to have differences so its not a complete ripoff (or atleast it to not look like a complete ripoff
also wait i realized what you meant ok uh i made that bc i couldnt find a fitting size engine and i remembered the f-22 has funky looking engines idk may be thrust vectoring
creations-chat 2022-08-01 16:27:26 Ok
can we stop arguing tho theres no point anymore, its settled, my plane is shit and im recieving criticism and i dont care about criticism because i am too lazy to even read it now imagine doing what theyre asking me to do

NVM FOUND A GOOD CLOSE UP
creations-chat 2022-08-07 20:03:07 it appear just to be a lengthened skycrane with 2 rotors to carry more weight its literally the same thing but longer lol compare the images

it also lacks a tail obv and the landing gear seem to be longer (not taller, longer from front to back) and there seem to be some weird horizontal stabilizers at the back that look like fighter jet elevators it looks like its angled downwards

i will copy this helicopter design for a custom heli hehehe

looks really unbalanced tho due to the weight that it seems to lack in the back for a back rotor to actually not make it spin around

custom bomber
creations-chat 2022-08-07 21:54:10 here you can see the wing shape, im basing it off the vickers valiant bc i wanted a cool 50s-60s bomber
creations-chat 2022-08-07 21:56:21 yea but its like the fastest way to do it and the least space taking saddly

plus i gotta be careful af with space bc i want to give this a massive bomb bay and an interior for the cockpit (wich will have 5 seats)

the wings will be (planned to be) full of angle lock with 7-8 angle locking per wing (i first planned how much angle lock id need)

general 2022-08-08 15:53:36 <@564463541248065547> basicly, nothing changes really in the servers, its just that (maybe) the maps would be diff (like if its sea it just has a few islands, and the rest is the infinite ocean, or if its land battle it has normal map but if its air battle its the same map as sea) and due to the name, a person who mains planes would rather go to sea
general 2022-08-08 15:53:43 like, its psychology based
general 2022-08-08 15:53:56 theres really no limitations nothing that forces you to not use planes in for example sea or land server
general 2022-08-08 15:54:10 its just that, barely anyone who plays with planes would actually go to a sea or land server
general 2022-08-08 15:54:30 well bc that really cant be done
general 2022-08-08 15:54:35 but psychology would work
general 2022-08-08 15:54:50 exactly
general 2022-08-08 15:55:03 a person that plays a plane will rather to go air because of fighting with planes and they may assume hey a land server may not be friendly to planes
general 2022-08-08 15:55:05 yea
general 2022-08-08 15:55:11 so psychology based, not limitation based
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:58:33 Any feedback on the cockpit? i say the interior is good but the exterior uhh would say its kinda shitty, mostly because i had limited space due to its tiny size, needing glass to not block the interior panels (wich is why i didnt do triangle wedges for the most front and just did wedges so it looks shit) and how far forward it is

https://streamable.com/wi29cm

it also has a slight angle lock
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:07:46 dont make it brighter bc it looks realistic plus bright colors sometimes become obnoxious on large builds

you really should decide color choice once most of it is finished because we cant really tell how it'd look at the end yet

ok nvm yea it should be a bit brighter but not a lot it looks good already tho has decent contrast with the rest of colors

creations-chat 2022-08-09 16:27:46 btw it does use helium but both versions use the same helium (and only for stabilization its a very tall ship), the real reason why it flies up so much is because when i was tryna stabilize it (since thrust is in the sails it pointed downwards) i added propellers pointing up on the bow and it flew, then i fixed it, then now i decided to make it do it again for a vid

plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:01:02 i used to believe some rules my brother made up to "spice up Uno" were real rules but we once played with an adult who knew a lot about strategy in the game and explained us that those rules didnt exist
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:01:20 and explained us how some of the rules actually worked bc we were too dumb to actually understand it
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:01:33 it went 300 speed and only used guns it didnt use its bombs thankfully and i have 4 cannons that can control elevation
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:01:47 and ship is a bit maneuverable in air but barely enough to try and track the plane when its attacking me, and he used to get really close
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:01:51 at a point i hit it where i had to hit
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:03:04 the plane went 300 speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:03:20 my boat went 35 forward at most if i put the correct throttle and with a damaged sail it went far slower and more unstable
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:04:03 the sails move it forward, but it has internal engines to:
keep stability bc since sails are on the top it tries to aim boat downwards
turning
rolling (manual stabilization sometimes required)
flight propellers

creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:09:18 made interior look less blocky by adding slopes at the back and front of the overhead bins

creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:18:37 for this, the plan is doing wings that start as 1 block wide and end as 0.5 blocks wide (wich will require some lot of angle lock)

it will require 4 angles for (obviously) the upwards angle the wings have
4 total anglelocks for the front angle (because the wing will be split in 2 parts so it can go from 1 block wide to 0.5, also it has 2 angles upward not because of the part thats 1 block wide, that has no upward angle, but instead because the wings need the anglelocked part and the solid fillup part making it a total 3 layers of wings)
total 2 anglelocks for the back angle
idk how much piston lock ill need

ill also make the rudder 0.5 blocks wide (wich will require a lot of angle lock to make it not be blocky on the front and back but i may give up and make it blocky on the front and back)
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:22:05 remember what i said about making tail not blocky with angle lock uhhh forget it it doesnt match and its a fucking terrible idea

im not gonna try using insane piston lock and angle lock to do it with trapdoors or disconnectors because then thats 100 times the work
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:24:10 it actually is because i dont have to do 2 pistons if i wanna use trapdoors for it i would have to use far more than 2 pistons, id say minimal 6 for the whole front, think about it, im not talking about the half wedge bc that doesnt match

i mean like trying to mimic what i attempted with the half wedge but with trapdoors (aka doing each side of the wedge manually so it matches)

as i said its a horrible idea
atleast for me

because the half wedge does not match look at the image bro
its like 50% wider

<@809781295500099584> thx
cockpit has no interior bc its sadly overwhelmed by the anglelock
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:26:54 it must be 0.5 and im talking about the rudder so it cant be like the 1st image, it has to be like the 2nd image but somehow 0.5 blocks wide instead of 1

wich is already a cancelled idea im just gonna make the front and back of rudder be blunt

we should stop discussing about this because it makes no sense im not doing it anyway
creations-chat 2022-08-17 15:29:28 ok so the tail will need 2 anglelocked parts (front and back) and a total of 3 piston locks (because if its 0.5 blocks wide it must match the center of the plane with piston lock) and maybe a bit of piston lock to make the angles at front and back match (making it 3-5 total piston locks for the rudder)

for the elevators im doing something similar except front isnt blunt bc i can do what the 1st image shows also **forgot to show 1st image from previous message here it is**

because its horizontal and not vertical unlike rudder (so it wont look ass)

creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:00:04 someone should make this, its a mig-25 turned into a business jet, it was a real plan and it was called the ye-155
creations-chat 2022-08-17 16:07:26 holy fuck that mig 25 is so tiny thats far smaller than roscale wtf

creations-chat 2022-08-18 16:46:23 rudder with bird icon if u want i can post what its meant to resemble

i know theres smol missing bits at the rudder i will fix them

i also know theres exposed motorlock imma ignore it because space is scarce in that area due to the thin rear and the piston lock required
creations-chat 2022-08-18 16:50:23 custom, also fixed the gaps, kinda
creations-chat 2022-08-18 16:52:30 true but its the best i can and will do and its big proggress i finished rudder, next is stabilizers, wings, landing gear, then somehow make it fly

it will also go around 780 speed (planned realistic speed based on the scale) but may make it go 800-900

creations-chat 2022-08-18 16:57:14 its kinda just weird tbh
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:23:52 should i suggest build trading for pc2? like you wanna do a photo with alts but the builds you wanna use are on one account or in general you wanna move stuff from an account to other (ofc needs permission from both accounts) wouldnt that be a good idea?
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:27:33 photos i said

and in pc 1 ppl use alts to make lots of builds and itd be a pain to have to remake them all into one account now that pc2 has inf files

switching alts becomes pointless in pc2 plus its annoying
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:30:00 no??? i said it needs confirmation from both sides and stuff like disabling alt trade requests could be done and no it wouldnt be like a huge message with a yes/no message (thats really fucking abusable) appears it would be a tiny notification prob in a corner of the screen or in the menu so it isnt annoying midgame

and it can be useful for actual build trading
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:32:50 i already said how the problems that it adds could be avoided like abusing trading or stealing builds etc

but yea it may bring scripting problems but like i dont think moving the data of a build to another account is harder than any other normal form of trading in roblox games
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:35:08 what if it requires the account to be old ingame to be able to be activated or smth or it gives a warning that has a cooldown before you can skip and forces you to read whenever you activate trading
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:37:21 the account age not the real life age bro are you even reading

then what about the 2nd idea or people just waits for the alt to be old enough lets say a week who knows a month thats all?
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:44:57 also the notification to not be a massive thing with yes/no that you can accidently press, maybe a notification thingy on the menu gui like configuration tab and it says to check trade and then you can see if you verify it and you can see the build (idk a 3d view of it some roblox games have 3d views of ingame models that spin and stuff maybe the same can be done here?) and it to have several verification tabs when you're confirming trade like idk yes are you sure really sure blah blah
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 14:55:52 wtf is the thing in the top

general 2022-08-19 14:58:14 Ok
general 2022-08-19 14:59:09 how to make so complex models in studio, importing 3d models from 3d modelling software?
general 2022-08-19 14:59:46 what are those basicly
general 2022-08-19 15:00:04 i tried to learn lender but i got too lazy to continue
general 2022-08-19 15:00:26 i made a donut (but i havent finished the tutorial that teaches the basics and im meant to also make it spin and add effects etc)
general 2022-08-19 15:00:30 ohh
general 2022-08-19 15:02:01 oooh so i dont really need to learn blender if i wanna make badass models in studio
general 2022-08-19 15:02:02 noted
general 2022-08-19 15:03:11 im asumming that needs a lot of negate
general 2022-08-19 15:03:21 question how do they make the sides equal?
general 2022-08-19 15:03:54 Ok i was assuming smth like that well i was about to say "does he clone the sides?"
general 2022-08-19 15:04:16 im guessing that
general 2022-08-19 15:05:00 i could learn blender, make boat, make boat battle animation, profit, issue: laziness
general 2022-08-19 15:05:13 solution: idk lmao

plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:54:42 should i finish my 747 ripoff plane after i finish my smol 40 meter airliner?
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:54:55 this smol airliner
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:55:13 the 747 ripoff is old and it was my first creation on my uhhh lemme count 5th plane crazy alt
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:55:24 but i havent finished it and its massive with overlocked wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:57:49 AL-20 Dawnliner is the 747 ripoff (aka fictional plane thingy im making) imma show it non spawned
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:58:02 
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:59:11 its got a hole on its left wing
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:59:14 (and right wing)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:59:19 "hole"
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 15:59:53 
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:00:00 death to paper thin wings (unless smol plen)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:00:27 it also already flies (if i put 0 gravity and the folding structures that have helium to float away get stuck)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:01:14 its been bonked by bonking vehicles several times and whenever that happens it gets thrown backwards, it does a 180 and flies stable forward for a while before stopping midair and then falling and it looks like it actually already is able to fly (but its not)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:01:30 funny
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:01:57 imma try to fly by putting 180 gravity it can already control itself kinda but will lose momentum after a while (but the weight will keep most of the momentum)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:02:45 wow
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:03:18 well i assume my plane wont be able to fly normally either due to weight unless i add helium i also would have to solve the structures getting stuck in the plane

epic fail: https://streamable.com/cvihio
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:04:38 i also have another planned airliner thats based off the dreamliner (but its gonna be called AL-22 cockatiel)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 16:05:22 i decided to make the smaller one (AL-25 Ringneck) bc i didnt feel like making a folding fuselage & folding wings (because the 747 ripoff proved its a pain and i lose motivation too fast)

creations-chat 2022-08-20 19:52:25 wings and engines are wip but here it is so far
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:30:22 finished 1 angle out of 3 each wing has, the next angle to do would be the secondary frontal angle bc well look at the 3rd image, the top starts with no angle and then it angles, thats to make the wing start at a decent width and then go down to 0.5 width, and that demands double the frontal angle, and the 3rd angle would be the back one (that doesnt require a secondary version bc it starts after the no angle top part ends)
creations-chat 2022-08-20 20:40:53 i said its wip

creations-chat 2022-08-20 21:05:49 theres an irl planned heli that has a bomb bay exactly like that

i was gonna make a heli inspired off that specific planned heli but i never finished it (was gonna have same tail design as the one shown so that one probably is based off what i was gonna base mine off)

i kinda did the weapon bay (it was just a motor 2 that moved a panel into horizontal position and it had rockets nothing special but it was smooth and had no gaps)

creations-chat 2022-08-20 22:27:01 i dont have robux on that acc

also kinda improvised it with a disconnector and an emoji, looks bad but ill fix it when i get the sparklers
creations-chat 2022-08-20 22:30:08 i mean it doesnt look THAT bad
if i get space, may use piston lock to make the orange thing inside the engine be smaller
creations-chat 2022-08-20 22:53:04 No 😄

creations-chat 2022-08-22 23:02:48 any feedback? also in my opinion the wings are really smooth, the smoothest anglelocked large wings ive done
creations-chat 2022-08-22 23:05:42 man does not understand how responding in discord works :Skull:

creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:08:11 i think ive heard of that type of propulsion someone made a yt vid on it with a mini boat that was hollow so it was possible to see it work cant find it tho and not it isnt that one of water falling and pushing the boat its one where the boat has a hole infront that leads to the back and that somehows propells it, just like how ur sub seems to do
help 2022-08-23 01:42:19 top one def better the one below is ass
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:43:55 prob its a water turbine or some stupid thing to cool down the engines (still terrible idea where the fuck is the sonar or space for anything else in the sub if so)
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:49:41 why dont we all shut up and just say, its futuristic sci-fi fictional shit in a lego game
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:00:35 ive finally fucking filled the hole at the rear of the plane
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:02:42 mfing plane already flies 💀 and its not even done (it flies alone tho i have zero control of it but i feel like making it controllable already)

also i know its missing the elevators its wip

added roll to the plane ima do a vid on it
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:07:00 https://streamable.com/z7xvue

new problem unlocked: how tf am i adding the elevators anyway
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:09:09 approximately the space i have for elevators... well not that bad tbh smth is smth
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:16:23 a jet engine is strong yes but it isnt that effective in water bc of the space it takes and how boats dont have wings, no pylons, and adding those would add extra drag, sorry if i sound like a nerd but your idea only works if thats either some sort of water jet that somehow works, if its a cooling intake then its a bad idea, and i mean its a very angled cone so yea it does produce double the drag of a normal submarine bow but atleast not more than double

also its kinda a bad idea bc it consumes a lot of space in general

also <@706717603258957864> i have to agree, thats some basic stuff that at maximum age to learn is 14
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:20:21 what if it uses a poop engine thats so powerfull it can even make the submarine go space (amphibious space sumbarine 😱)

but since it make engine dirty they need water intake to clean!!!

Solution :smart: 😎

yes its a futuristic poop engine
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:27:01 the tail should be thicker then tho but thats cool

Ok fuzzy, problem is the jet takes a lot of space from the sub unless its just a thin pipe going thru the whole sub also i think nozzle doesnt have to be thick to give good thrust maybe that adds even more pressure idk

WAIT I WAS LOOKING AT IT THE WRONG WAY

yea the sub has the right shape for the engine in reality it has a cone that sucks up the water and then a thin pipe shoots it at high pressure to give thrust

it probably also anyway has enough space inside

problem is that it uses steam and.... that requires an exhaust wich is not a submarine thing, idk
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:30:16 <@866848584888877077> read that anyway i gtg cya correct me if i said anything wrong tomorrow nice discussion
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:19:07 No
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:21:15 read what it says..... i said it doesnt fly and i used 0 gravity to take pictures of it in the sky
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:23:31 its got 1900 blocks, laggy as hell for some reason and too heavy to fly would require helium wich makes it fly wobbly and weird and theres no space for a conveyor drive because of all the motorlock, i'd have to sacrifice the interior or make it exposed

and i dont want any rank from it so it isnt necessary

may later find a way to make it fly i dont think i have space for a conveyor drive but if it turns out to have space for it ill do it
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:30:52 roblox avatars are REALLY wide, if you used roscale you are making a roblox avatar 4 feet wide, and he said semi because he knew he didnt do it 100% roscale

so like, width makes scale look weird in roblox but really that looks very accurate to me

a normal person is 38 cm wide, in roblox according to roscale a person is 121 cm wide
only height is accurate

also no, im saying atleast it is close to accurate or roscale
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:34:29 roblox avatars arent meant to be 5 feet tall, thats just what people like the most to use because making 1 stud equal 1 feet is easier than making it equal a different number or decimals, and bringing up ro-scale means bringing up numbers, and i brought up the numbers myself

never said you brought up numbers
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:36:32 can you give me the length and wingspan of your plane? in plane crazy blocks, lets calculate the scale and see how close it is to roscale, ive been told roscale is 1 block 0.77 meters

<@759223009218658376> its a plane prop deal with it lmfao

<@750712383227428945> i agree lmao how tf does one do roscale without using numbers like bro 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:39:32 the avatar is too wide and that makes it actually hard to measure through just your avatar because it tricks perspective

<@759223009218658376> why are you talking about the build in the first place if you havent even seen it lmfao it has probably more angle lock than you have ever done in your life

look at the elevators, the wings, the nose and the rudder

need me to point it out?

<@448677698773057547> ok true
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:41:58 yea because your only angle locked plane just has 3 angle locks for the cockpit and is rather small 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:46:52 my plane has a massive motorlock tower compared to its size that makes its weight 10 times larger than it should be has not much wing panels due to the need to make it move with not many hover thrusters (fun fact: lag exists and hover thrusters produce it)
**the total angle locks used are:**
4 for nose
3 for the rudder
12 for the wings
6 for the elevators
**the total piston locks used are:**
7 for the rudder
1 for the front landing gear
**overall:**
0 space left for cockpit interior
barely any space for passenger cabin interior
0 space left for bathroom or flight crew cabin
0 space left for a conveyor drive
a tiny little bit of exposed lock in response to the scarce space for all the stuff i had to add

how do i make it fly 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:50:12 yea restart please gap too big and the hull is just shit in general

can show you a closer picture of nose if you need it but later
creations-chat 2022-08-24 22:39:32 wait i thought it was done with trails so it looks like that now i realize theyre gaps yea this has no motorlock my bad

like damn this thing looks unreal its so tiny

man prob used magnet lock for the landing gear? idk it seems unreal to fit those and those look circular so may have also used tnt on engines

creations-chat 2022-08-26 23:46:43 nice but why all your photos include stuff in background its kinda annoying try to get other angle sometimes it matches colors or obstruct good view of certain details
creations-chat 2022-08-28 00:10:02 ive made a supersonic private jet (Too good) should i post it?

max speed planned is 3400 but sometimes it just goes far beyond that, 3400 speed in the scale the plane uses translates to 2800 km/h

based off ye-155 but not ye-155 bc i want my own custom planes for my own nation and ye-155 wasnt built

creations-chat 2022-08-28 00:38:07 its based off the ye-155 but its meant to not be the ye-155 bc its made for a fictional nation that has no relations at all with the ussr, also the ye-155 was a commercial version of the mig 25

if i can make a private jet of that size this fast surely i can make a space shuttle that goes atleast 5k speed
but would be ideal to make it go around 35k speed
yes im planning to make a shuttle but not any time soon i wanna get even better than i already am first
next im making a dual turboprop high wing airliner (those look cool you get me)
creations-chat 2022-08-28 00:47:42 i know the space shuttle orbital vehicle dives but i said space shuttle because thats the name of the whole thing, the tank boosters and orbital vehicle all together
creations-chat 2022-08-28 01:28:39 yes
creations-chat 2022-08-28 01:34:18 i agree, the wildcat and the corsair are VERY FAMOUS, well the wildcat not as famous but the corsair id say is equally as famous as the f-14 but not more than f-22 (The f-22 is also heavily stereotyped)
creations-chat 2022-08-28 01:49:33 bad quality car (the car is bad quality, image is like if an expert photographer who spent 100 years on his career took it and i love the angles and quality and the lighting choices but the car ruins it fuck the car)

i will never make a car for the reason that a detailed car requires to be oversized or a bit above roscale like lets say double the size of roscale and i hate it when a build doesnt have a size close to roscale
creations-chat 2022-08-28 01:51:54 the car is bad quality, image is like if an expert photographer who spent 100 years on his career took it and i love the angles and quality and the lighting choices but the car ruins it fuck the car

creations-chat 2022-09-02 16:36:27 its gonna be a plane inspired off the twin otter (but it wont be the twin otter ill call it parrot lol!!!)
its gonna have a seaplane variant (reason why im making it i want a commercial flight seaplane) called parrotfish
creations-chat 2022-09-02 17:05:37 i already angle locked the nose, read messages below that
creations-chat 2022-09-02 18:08:16 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQSrVFRg7k8 someone recreate this crash ingame
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:44:35 plen so far
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:46:48 custom and it will have a seaplane variant, the twin otter is my inspiration
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:51:42 i mean, he probably means hull detail, i think i know why it looks like that, 1800s steamers looked like a mix of pirate ships and modern ships

it will probably have windows and stuff and sails
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:53:52 i was right it has sails and also the cabin doesnt look right he should angle lock it (unless he doesnt know how to)
creations-chat 2022-09-02 22:51:54 im using the size of a real plane and this size is accurate and its actually a bit shorter than the accurate size bc the wings angle up slightly

creations-chat 2022-09-03 02:54:35 my plane so far, itll have 2 versions, seaplane and normal, normal will have fixed landing gear, but for now, it has neither <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

from this point on i will basicly add another motorlock tower from below bc i cant keep expanding the one above, and ill split off to the seaplane design once landing gear variant is done (off from there i can make floaties, motorlock the floaties and repurpose landing gear supports for floaties)

https://streamable.com/2l6p4i
creations-chat 2022-09-03 02:56:55 this is pretty much what ill do so the landing gear supports def can be repurposed for the floaties supports but the floaties will still require more supports and ill have to remove the front landing gear support bc its useless for floatplane variant

also yes the nose is rough because the angle lock is super compact so i had to use lots of disconnectors <@695804183500161065> 

<@650765213204742154> im making this a custom plane but im too dumb to make my own sizes so im copying the dimensions of a real plane completely so no, the nose length is accurate
creations-chat 2022-09-03 02:59:40 compare (engine position looks a bit weird bc of 3d perspective)
also <@695804183500161065> i know how to use camera lock properly it depends on main seat and a lotta shit but i dont need it if i know how to use angle lock & have space for angle lock (i only use cameralock when i lack space or its a very tiny detail)

plus camera lock doesnt give nice angles sometimes and it cant be pistonlocked
creations-chat 2022-09-03 03:02:28 this plane gives a paradisiac vibe prob because the inspiration to make a plane like this was bc of the images below first one

seaplanes just give a nice vibe

creations-chat 2022-09-07 13:57:35 holy fuck this dumbass bitch stole pieces from the wikipedia logo kill her!!!
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:08:33 i realized wings wouldnt be able to be put forward enough, so i had to shorten the angle below the nose, and with that came that the angle lock looked bad so i had to make double the angle lock for it to look good

now it looks kinda weird but meh something is something

atleast not cheese grater
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:10:42 plus this gives a bit more smoothness to those gaps inbetween the half wedges so kinda a win but its hardly noticeable, now ill work on the wings and then ill work on the cockpit and finish fuselage, wings must be prioritized bc the tower is all clustered and i need to have the space for wings used up before i can do anything else bc of the risk of having no space for wings

wings will have approx 5 angle locks each wing and i dont know if ill need any piston lock and probably will need 7 per wing if something doesnt go as planned, bc the wings will be smooth, half a block thick and angled upwards

should i give teeth to the nose..? would be my first time doing that
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:18:46 tested belly color, aint that bad is it?
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:25:07 testing a scheme, itll have 3 colors, belly, main color and secondary color, the belly color and main color are already there, what should be the secondary color? brown, dark orange, pale green or dark green
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:27:49 this is looking disappointing, one color has to be scrapped and belly color kinda aint fitting there, what should i scrap, green or skin color and what should the replacement color be
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:44:25 doesnt look that disappointing anymore does it?
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:48:23 looks kinda off prob could motorlock some stuff to fuselage so its smoother looking
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:54:40 how does camo look now?
creations-chat 2022-09-07 15:56:57 i may change propeller nose color to be camouflage too also i changed a bit the camouflage bc that part was bothering me a lot

creations-chat 2022-09-07 16:39:46 filled up nose a bit more, next ill do wings (and: landing gear, fuel tanks and guns) and when i finish wings ill make cockpit and fill up nose and add exhausts and leave space for decal work make cool cockpit interior do the back of the fuselage do rudder and tail make it fly and give it bomb

creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:19:25 it may look good to you but it has lots of gaps an actual good dinosaur builder could cover with motorlock and ropes

thats just a mediocre dinosaur builder that made his build look good by giving it camo and decals you gotta fucking admit

if he had a video of it walking it would get more upvotes, too
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:22:35 ive seen dinosaurs with less gaps than that, a few ropes would fix those gaps or even disconnectors plus hes got gaps in areas where he cant use the excuse of them being moving parts like the head around the eyes (and the head is one of the most important details)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:24:38 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1011298433639915690 look at this for example
also you have a vid of it walking yes but... is it in the post at <#384025409945337856> ? No and thats one of your mistakes...
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:27:09 i know the dinosaur i showed you has GAPS, i never said it has no gaps, but it only has them on moving parts and very well closed together, due to the size of your dinosaur and lack of parts, the movement of the moving parts create gigantical horrible gaps, and you have gaps on unexplainable areas like AROUND THE EYES, not talking about where the motor for the jaw is, i know thats a moving part and i also know the head moves, theres anything that moves infront of the eyes where you have an unexplainable gap? No.

<@797652706814328852> already did dumbass

im gonna write it again with all the grammar you want then
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:31:29 mf explain this gap

if you say thats the nose mf emojis and motorlock exist you didnt have to make a huge gap inside the head thats exposed to the outside
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:33:34 "on my level tbh" mf you both have no posts on creations hes on your fucking level

<@950892715158175774> that gap is tiny and theres blocks that can cover that tiny gap... show me it from up close if you wanna change my mind because i can admit im not 100% sure you can fill that but it looks like its possible

plus that small gap aint your only mistake, having so little moving parts means that when your dinosaur's torso or tail or neck angles it leaves a massive gap, if you had more moving parts for the angles the gaps would be less large
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:36:11 i do not have bitches, but i dont see you with any either, and you are not correct for once, having massive gaps between moving parts bc he was too lazy to add more moving parts isnt the thing

<@950892715158175774> i see the gap you know trapdoors and cameras exist i could fill that in with trapdoors and cameras... i had to do that for my plane let me find the post

https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1015810931281899610 here it is look at the nose, that requires motorlock like the one you had to do and i could hide it with a trapdoor, unlike you...
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:38:14 trapdoor to hide the motorlock, theres 2 locked motors to bring the 1x2 half wedges down, what you had to do was just add a trapdoor thats connected to the half wedge 1x1 with a camera so its brought down with it and it hides the motorlock...

whoops responded wrong message but atleast right person

<@842459687664222208> plane looks cool so far
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:46:17 i start to agree with you this dumbass has zero grammar and is starting to get beyond the line
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:48:50 mf thats not where im telling you to put the damn trapdoors oh my god look at my plane theyre not placed like that over the half wedge are they? you're doing whats in the 1st image, im telling you to do whats in the 2nd image so the trapdoor goes down with it

<@894395935201853440> i think you're telling him to not go school because you envy the fact that he goes to school and you dont, you kind of give it away with your grammar
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:51:14 theyre not opposite builds, we use the exact same building system the exact same game and i saw your build and i can easily say the way you made that motorlock is the same way i made mine in the nose except you didnt cover it and im telling you how you can

buffoon
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:53:23 dude, just because my build is a plane and your build is a dinosaur does not mean you cant use the same technique i used to cover the motorlock... are you fucking ill?

literally in the same situation, in the same position, with the same possibilities

your head is 1 fucking wide, theres nothing obstructing it unless the eye is a sign, and you can aim the dot of the trapdoor towards it

SO FUCKING EASY

unless you dont understand how trapdoor hitboxes work yet then makes a lot of sense, whitename

im telling you: learn to cover motorlock using block hitboxes to your advantage, im trying to help
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:55:41 how am i being hypocrite? i never contradicted myself

dunce i once made a world in a building game called planet making and it was about making planets you dumbass
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:57:43 dude... i said "just because our builds are different **DOESNT MEAN** you cant use the same building technique" learn to read

complete dumbass want me to simplify the sentence?

i said "our builds are different but yes you can use the same technique to do the thing i did in mine because it is the same thing you are trying to do in yours"

because you were acting like you couldnt do the same thing despite the fact you can
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:00:11 "to dumb to be fixed" exactly you are too dumb to fix the hole in your dinosaur

i said i dont have dinosaurs and that has nothing to do with hiding a small piece of motorlock that could've happened the same way in anything a car a plane a boat a dinosaur your mother a cake a fork a box a house ANYTHING

your skull seems to be shrinking and compacting your brain every second we speak

my friend glxct **im talking about hiding motorlock that was added to pull a half wedge down** not **how to make a dinosaur nose in a fork**
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:02:56 it has nothing to do with dinosaurs glxct, EXACTLY, because im not talking about the fact your build's a fucking shit dinosaur, im talking about the fact you cant hide half a block worth of exposed motorlock because you're too dumb to use **trapdoors**

<@853750272529399809> yea he doesnt understand it

i never said im superior for having a diff name color?

plus just because i can play a game properly doesnt mean i cant have a life
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:07:14 i never said having another name colour makes one superior
just because i know wich of the 6 sides of a trapdoor block in a game connect and wich ones dont doesnt mean physically cannot have a social life irl

stop it, we need to stop ok
just learn it, trapdoors hide motorlock, your fucking idioticy and bad quality images for posts dont.

<@781340749412171786> actually im grinding in aeronautica while i argue <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:09:16 i dont get how this dumbass mf cant hide this with a trapdoor hes just too stubborn and independent to listen to me, if i can do it why cant he
2nd image is how i could've hided it
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:11:36 look at this if i can hide the exposed motorlock in this and have nothing exposed **(other than the back because thats not done and its obviously gonna be covered up in the future and those exposed pistons are not yet configured pistons because i havent done the part im gonna connect them to yet)**
why cant i hide the exposed motorlock in your dinosaur shit
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:13:47 your dinosaur is no propeller powered plane correct but it is a fucking build in the videogame inside the hit game roblox, known as plane crazy, and you can use the exact same technique i showed you to hide the fucking motorlock

im not mad, im trying to help you

all i want is you to understand the simple logic of plane crazy building

how tf do those people in the HOF exist? because they understand the simple logic behind making plane crazy builds
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:17:06 i have no mental issues, im trying to teach you how to do basic building techniques in a game but you are being far too stubborn to listen, you're the one who has mental issues if you are trying to make random people in the internet mad for the sole purpose of entertainment and the feeling of superiority

creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:26:27 you did not do it, show me the image again, i remember you did it horribly wrong and i even showed you your mistake, plus you just said you'd fix it and you were thankfull to someone who literally said he agreed with me, that shows how much your only reason to not listen was because you would feel humilliated to admit defeat towards someone you argued for half a hour with

im not gonna make peace until he admits hes too dumb to use trapdoors

creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:07:16 wings so far (dont worry they will have angle lock and wont be paper thin)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:35:34 landing gear, btw the exposed locks that are near the fuselage will be camouflaged with an intake and the wing shape is not done it wont look like that once angle locked https://streamable.com/mnew72
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:38:00 they already hide themselves unless you mean the wheel ill put a trapdoor on it but that kinda looks ugly ill show later
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:40:12 ive realized a horrible issue, the piston lock and the angle lock are completely exposed, and i gotta find a way to hide them
worst of all is theyre in a way if i put them 1 block inside they will be exposed at the other side, and if i do 0.5 i shorten the wing length and fuck up the entire thing
and piston lock wont fix it bc the piston lock is in the first place the thing thats exposing it

thats probably the first sign to cancel the plane

unless i find the impossible way to fix it

wich as i said is impossible

i thought of a way but id have to re-do the whole damn wing and thats gonna be no easy deal
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:20 theres no way to fix it
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:55:23 theres no way to make it look better
theres no space inside to put a 3 bladed propeller or angle lock it so the cone is more circular
theres zero space inside

just barely enough space to make its base be a half block wich requires some complex text work

my biggest worry rn is the wings because theres no way to hide the motorlock used to fold them, now talk about adding more angle lock to them
creations-chat 2022-09-08 17:00:04 this is impossible to hide, not even if it was a 2 block wide exposure i could make the angle of the back be more behind but its literally sticking out bc its piston lock, and if i managed to hide it the angle of the wings would be completely ruined so id have to add more piston lock and i have no space for that or else add exposed motorlock in the back and theres no space in the nose bc thats where the wings come from, i need to be clear off the wings to add angle lock

what's next?

i dont know what to do at this point, maybe ill delete the wings and try doing them again later while considering hiding exposed locks as a priority
creations-chat 2022-09-08 17:04:25 imma do a diff save where ill re-do the wings and use old save to remember stuff necessary for them

this failure was a huge hit to my motivation so i may move to making another plane before continuing this further
creations-chat 2022-09-08 17:25:11 later gotta go to school soon

the system is overcomplicated
creations-chat 2022-09-09 00:15:35 sort of
creations-chat 2022-09-09 00:19:20 i fixed the wings i unexposed the lock but the cost was making each wing require its own section in the motorlcok tower and cant make exact wingspan (its off by just a little like 0.4 blocks anyway) due to the lack of piston lock but i managed to make them connect the most exact possible to fuselage wich is a big upgrade and exposed lock is no more wich is the most important, i also realized i need to prioritize making landing gear separate because of how the wing panels gotta cover the whole lower area and landing gear dont permit that if theyre placed along with the wing area

i also realized that since i make landing gear start not hidden, i can make it so that the angle is perfectly vertical with some angle tweakings, i will also add winglights to the plane bc irl the spitfire, hurricane, p-51, bf 109, and many more ww2 fighters and even bombers had those

theres now a bit of exposed locks in the cockpit but its behind and looks rather like detail (Will paint them later)
creations-chat 2022-09-09 01:10:10 slow
creations-chat 2022-09-09 01:12:30 i mean it literally cant be upvoted no matter what you try but its still shit

why doesnt some dude with a harrier or a british jet do an edited memorial image thats good fr thatd be nice

or make a british truck idk she was a mechanic back in ww2

or a vulcan like, any plane she saw in service when she was queen and some other patriotic crap and done

i feel like turning my custom propeller plane into an spitfire in honour of queen elizabeth II but damn i want a custom plane for my pcmg lore man and i neither want my skin peeled and to be put salt on

plane-crazy 2022-09-10 00:56:34 does anyone have the 200m visits thumbnail i wanna show it to a friend whos curious about it (he never heard of it)
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:50:02 i knew i shouldnt have posted that thing also i mean what are you tryna point out about it whats wrong of whats inside the circle

it is smaller than the "roscale" you guys use bc you use 1 block 0.77 meters and i use 1 block 0.9 meters, i calculated the scale and thats how tiny the plane ended up and 1 block wide was actually extremely close to the numbers i got

also if you are reffering to inaccuracies to the harrier in those red circles you probably didnt read the post, its fictional and i made it have differences to the harrier on purpose
creations-chat 2022-09-10 01:52:50 i dont really wanna discuss about the plane because it isnt meant to look pretty its meant to vtol thats the whole purpose

1. yes 1 block wide is ugly most of the time
2. theres nothing wrong with the nose really
3. the intake is shaped like that so it isnt a complete copy of the harrier
4. i mean its meant to look different from the harrier so probably what you're calling weird is the fact that its different (unless its for the sole reason that its roscale i mean its literally smaller than roscale

it was a really rushed plane, it only has 331 blocks and was made for the sole purpose of vtolling, not even pvp or speed or stability or looks just vtolling, and it was made under 2 hours, what did you expect

all i can say is that i agree with most of what you're saying, it looks shit honestly but its funny to use
creations-chat 2022-09-10 02:02:41 look at this image wich i used for landing gear of inspiration, i was wrong the harrier has 4 landing gear not 5 but whatever

may make a yak 38 inspired plane yet but with a bit more modern look and lower wings and greater size

well its usefull for pushback bc it has no pushback key and i wont add it bc id have to restabilize and this is too small for lots of stabilization to be added, plus it looks funny and adds originality

i literally pushback by pressing vtol key and pitching up and the back landing gear just holds the plane
creations-chat 2022-09-10 02:06:04 yea ur right but its still usefull for pushback
creations-chat 2022-09-10 02:08:29 i mean its bad for pvp, and i said it isnt for looks, all it is is for... well.. vtolling and to have a few images of a bad quality model of the plane in the lore info for my pcmg

may next do an x2 scale vtol plane based off yak 38 but a bit more modern bc 1987 introduction (compared to yak 38's 1976 introduction)

may give the wings a rather normal fighter jet shape instead of early vtol fighter jet shape or a combination of it to make an original look

btw theres a good reason for my plane intake, the harrier had a huge intake bc of the overheating of the engine and how during vtolling it could have intake issues due to the exhausts reaching it, so why dont we just make an even larger intake to kind of solve the problem halfway
creations-chat 2022-09-10 02:30:22 winglights turned on properly, i forgot to fix rudder winglight keybind

like i get it it has no exposed locks but it has no motorlock atleast at plain view, horrible quality image so we can barely distinguish what it is really like but it seems really basic motorlock less and the turret is too wide it just looks stupid in general 😨

i mean my post isnt limited to the renault ft and it atleast has better proportions

that thing has zero motorlock and the turret looks too large

the exposed locks are also not bc i couldnt hide them but because i had to fit a hella ton of other stuff inside for functionality (a hella ton of wing panels so it goes slow while having a lotta power so it can climb really steep angles)

and that needed a 2nd motorlock tower wich basicly made the upper one unable to be hidden unless i had made the tank's functionality garbage

bet that mfing thing cant even climb without having to go 100 speed

creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:22:01 I am not complaining anymore? i only mentioned that once, i didnt cause an argument or kept bringing it up, you're the one complaining about the situation

i already got over it

Ok
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:24:12 Rate dogshit on <#384025409945337856> 

he was rushed and made for the purpose of pvp, have compassion for him, he was made in 1 hour and half

that was just a comment for satirical purposes i am sentient the plane is shit

1. i literally said i rushed it

2. the part where i ask for compassion was a joke

3. i already stopped talking about the renault ft thing a while ago
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:26:14 because that was a joke...

i literally named the plane dogshit
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:30:19 first of all, the build was rushed, thats not my skill level, it was just made for pvp and messing around

i repeat, the compassion part was a joke

i only mentioned the renault ft thing once because and cant ignore the fact that thing's turret is wider than russia

im not complaining about the renault ft thing anymore, im only mentioning it as defense because you guys keep complaining about it instead

cant this argument just stop

ok you guys are misunderstanding something

im not talking about dogshit getting downvotes im completely ignoring that, im talking about a renault ft i made way back
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:33:05 first of all, the "essays" arent jokes, never said that, im saying the part where i ask for compassion for dogshit was a joke

second, im not talking about dogshit not getting upvotes im not bringing that up at all, im bringing up how a renault ft (that i made centuries ago it isnt my current skill level either) got a hella ton of downvotes along a mark V tank, but that thing that has conveyor treads got like 50 upvotes 

and im not complaining about it, im just repeating what i said because you guys apparently cannot read what i said in the first place and require to be reminded
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:35:45 i didnt say that...

you clearly are unable to read or shut up 

<@761354294859005962> your mig is larger and can have more detail and i said my plane was rushed it wasnt made to look good, it was just for pvp and messing around, and to get familiar again with PC stuff before continuing to work on my ww2 plane bc i was inactive in plane crazy for months 😐

all i said was, that thing has zero motorlock and has conveyor treads and a shitty turret how does it get upvotes, im not saying my build should get upvotes its also shit, but how does that thing get upvotes that can be made by a noob in 10 minutes
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:39:02 why are you guys unable to stop an argument, is this what you guys do all day? All i did was say that build looked dogshit and made a random practice plane that you guys decided to infuse with the 2 garbage renault ft situation and confusing yourselves over and over without listening to a single thing i say because according to you a basic argument is a 1000 word essay

im taking criticism, im not defending my builds i agree they look shit even, **but instead,** these people think i am not allowed to give criticism to a random build.

in my opinion it looks dogshit and shouldnt have upvotes, im **not** saying mine should have upvotes
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:41:38 i was complaining at the moment, but i had stopped before, you guys brought it up and caused an argument, and im saying my responses during this argument arent essays, im not denying what i said about the renault ft looks like an essay

you guys are champions at misunderstanding basic stuff

yes i did??? i said that renault ft deserves no upvotes <@722156712714305967> 
but im not saying mine deserves upvotes either, wich is what you guys are apparently thinking i am arguing for

you guys arent reading are you?
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:44:09 **im not saying my build should be considered better, i am NOT saying that, read, NOT. Basic and easy to understand word**

**Im saying both look dogshit and none should have upvotes, and that renault ft that im complaining about doesnt deserve upvotes, and i repeat, i am NOT saying mine deserves upvotes EITHER**

i already complained about it and stopped, you dont have to cause a whole argument about it, you lack the mental capacity to shut up about a topic already skipped

im not complaining anymore, im just rewording what i say in way simpler to understand terms for your little peanut brains, because you are unable to read the word NOT.
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:49:13 with better proportions im bringing up the fact that thing's turret is wide af bro 😨

with that it cant climb thats a comment on about how i designed my renault ft for functionality once again, not saying that makes mine better in detail, im saying that makes mine better in functionality

once again i mentioned the turret part again and the motorlock part is irrelevant now

and with the first thing i said thats not saying mine should get upvotes, thats a way to say the standards are broken here

deal with it, both builds are dogshit and one has a turret as wide as russia and the other has exposed locks, none deserves upvotes and thats what i complained for

im not saying functionality is the reason for the lack of upvotes... im saying i made exposed locks to fit the functionality
im not saying the tank having functionality should get it upvotes what the hell are you on about at this rate 😭
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:53:25 i never said i didnt get upvotes for functionality, i said i made the motorlock exposed to fit the functionality, and i didnt say my tank should get upvotes, i asked why that one got upvotes unlike mine, because it literally has a massive turret and conveyor treads and shouldnt be upvoted

that is not an essay, thats a response, there was like 10 people arguing, how am i gonna respond all of them at once with a small message, plus, you guys are unable to read so i also had to repeat and reinforce what i said before, wich adds more than just new stuff brought up
creations-chat 2022-11-26 15:57:28 "like 10" mf that was an exaggeration you people just cannot comprehend basic stuff can you

you get to send small messages, i had to respond to about 3-7 people in the argument and bring up again what i said before because you guys kept misunderstanding what i said before, so i couldnt just say one thing as i had to:
-repeat stuff
-re explain stuff
-explain new stuff
-say new stuff
-respond to every issue each of the 3-7 people brought up in the argument

if you do not care then why are you still arguing about it

and if you really for real dont care, then why dont you shut up right now and stop arguing, how about that solution, we all stop wasting eachothers time and forget this idioticy other than the fact that man fit russia in one renault ft turret

also its meant to be fictional bc i want my custom nation to have competition to the f-35 and su-75 (its meant to be some sort of world power and i want it to be self sufficient in vehicle design)

creations-chat 2022-11-29 18:33:41 Plane im making for pvp, black line is where the intake will start (it will have an angle tho), should i put an angle lock below the nose or leave it like that so it looks like a curved up fuselage like russian fighter jets have

btw im using the mig 29 and f-18 for inspiration

and i said its for pvp no im not fixing some issues like the overall fuselage shape or cockpit i dont want it laggy or unstable

I will probably leave the nose how it is bc ive never made a plane with a curved up nose like russian fighters and it doesnt look that bad to me, afterall its a pvp plane not showcase, if i made a showcase plane itd be a large scale to not have a 1 block wide nose too, i just make small planes for pvp bc faster to make and harder to hit

creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:46:45 nose not done yet
creations-chat 2022-12-13 19:49:01 its not really that smooth but i do have space for piston lock, issue is im lazy plus id have to double the tower size needed bc the body isnt wide enough for both sides to have piston lock in one layer

plus not really a large issue and ive got greater problems for the build
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:06:35 2021, it will be just 2 years ago soon, not 3
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:27:27 nose angle lock done, still looks shit tho
creations-chat 2022-12-13 20:29:31 it is barely almost 2, how the hell do you say almost 3, almost 3 is like 2.5 or 2.8, but thats around 1.8 years ago

your logic just doesnt work no matter how you say it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:12:02 never realized this was happening, it shouldnt be happening, prob bc of landing gear
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:15:47 problem fixed (the landing gear wheel ended up on the top of the plane somehow but uh thats a folding fault bc the landing gear was retracting while the plane folded)
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:20:54 Should i add another angle lock to the nose just so its a bit smoother? also fully fixed all issues with landing gear fix
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:24:03 idk man the canopy can be made better by using cylinders and crap thing is i wanna get in or out from the plane and the angle is already good for the front, i could add angle lock for the trap door part so it angles down a bit tho that may make it look better without removing my ability to get in and out, counting on the only way to get in and out is the canopy, cannot do it by glitching on the sides bc 2 wide nose
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:26:28 yes
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:43:04 still looks shit but looks smoother now

now im gonna add some angle lock to the canopy
creations-chat 2022-12-13 21:57:51 i guess this looks a bit better, i will add trails to it now, also thats a horrible idea bc then id need a lot more hover thrusters to make this thing fly and therefore laggier counting on the fact that i spam delta wings makes it laggier alone

wont use conveyor engine bc thats a last resort and it makes this unstable, i want this to be good for pvp too, as a bomber interceptor or a bomber itself bc it wont dogfight properly (its meant to be a massive fighter designed to outrun and outrange bombers but it wont serve the purpose that well)
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:14:21 No, i dont want the plane to be laggy, that nose is good enough for a pvp plane

i dont want it unstable either
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:16:22 wydm then
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:20:22 why cant you just tell me what you're talking about i dont get what else you mean when saying nose
like, whats so hard and complicated about that?
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:22:32 how is it a 180 degree angle what are you on about im sorry if im too stupid to understand what you're saying but you should find a better way to explain it
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:25:19 i just dont understand what you're saying is a 180 degree angle like mf nose is the shit on front of a plane its a freaking cylinder and at the end a cone most of the time where is there a 180 degree angle, a 180 degree angle is literally turning all the way back thats quite impossible unless i make the nose flat and blunt
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:28:52 and the nose is not a 0 micrometer thin paper its a cylinder its impossible for it to have a 180 degree angle, it goes on a 10 degree angle to a 16 degree angle and then it turns 90 or 45 (idk too lazy to measure that im just assuming from what ive done before) degrees and does another 16 and then another 10 (approximately) theres no 180 degree angle if there was the nose would be a wing panel, how about you give me a graphic representation to see what you mean because theres no way in understand what you're saying right now
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:32:50 and... how do i fix something that happens on everything
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:35:30 yea that part is flat you could've just said that part had no angle until the canopy, but no im not fixing that because to fix that id have to do a hella ton of tweaking to the nose and a complete redesign of the whole front of the plane OR make the nose taller wich are 2 options im not taking
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:37:36 this is good enough for me

you just said "thats a 180 degree angle" not "it has no visible angle until the canopy" or smth like that, and just saying its flat wont work because... i mean every surface is literally flat, flat =/= no angle UNLESS context is added <@883063424614006878>
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:43:35 i have to add 1 trail horizontal on each side at the front of the canopy, and then i gotta add 1 trail on each side vertical at the back of the canopy and maybe same thing for the front
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:45:40 turbines and tnt, make sure the tnt is moved into a half block grid at nearly the center of the engine by the motorlock system so the explosion works, i used blast radius 1.5, it works only on an specific position so u gotta do what i said, atleast thats what works for the 2 block wide one

for the 3 wide one it may be easier than 2 block wide and i dont think 1 block wide one is possible but it most likely is
creations-chat 2022-12-13 22:48:03 in 10 years
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:21:36 small ass canopy f-16
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:24:09 making ur plane have such a long antenna makes it less maneuverable (i get it its a joke), if you add a wing panel at the end of it your plane becomes more maneuverable, idk why but having too little drag on the ends makes it less maneuverable somehow, figured that out when trying to experiment good pvp maneuverabilities 

also in general what kinda plane be that, that doesnt look like a normal f-16 if it is
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:26:25 draken f-16 and supermaneuverable f-16
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:15:21 this design leaves the motor 2 exposed but its smooth and seamless in general, i can camouflage the motor 2 with a decoration or smth, problem is this is a high wing plane so the wing is already out of the list of things i can use to camouflage it

also yes i know theres a lot of exposed motorlock its just a temporal design placement to test it, the actual motorlock wont be exposed
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:18:53 goofy landing gear (i will use angle lock to add trapdoors and stuff to cover the gap and i also tested what trapdoors do to it already, it helps further hide the landing gear so yea it pretty much works properly)
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:23:57 the only thing holding the plane together is that carpet
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:28:10 red is yet to be angle locked, blue is doors

plane design is going really smoothly
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:30:48 yes... but it fits the plane atleast
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:33:12 it also fits the scale im using for the specific plane size and type, and also heres the back it looks way worse it will get angle lock for a half block wide rudder so the cutter doesnt look out of place tho

also the plane is rushed so every opportunity to make something fast is taken no matter what, thats also why the entire fuselage is almost ready and the back landing gear already exists, but i will slow down greatly when it comes to the rudder and wings
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:45:24 doored (got slowed down bc i misplaced the back doors twice also the door floats but its the most smooth design possible thats also simple
creations-chat 2022-12-15 20:51:43 aw fuck i forgot the landing gear had to be 1 block compared with the fuselage and theyre actually 0.5 blocks up, got too distracted with getting the system to work

and that means the system has to be replaced

may try thickening fuselage later so the vtol stuff makes more sense the landing gear, bomb bay, intakes, and engines clip into eachother

imma draw blueprint in krita and then im gonna make it in plane crazy with more detail ofc bc plane crazy less limited than this thing if the build is done right, problem is fuselage is really small gotta make it taller for both motorlock and design reasons
