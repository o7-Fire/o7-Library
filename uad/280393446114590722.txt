creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:20:22 not saying it is, I didn't even vote on it because I didn't even see it 
just tryna say that the people who did downvote most likely have their reasons why
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:23:13 id say build length does matter as it shows that you put forth some of your own time to work on it which is a dedication 
but it doesn't matter if the build itself is kinda lackluster for the time 

you know? its kinda like a "oh so you spent 2 weeks on this and all you got is that?" thing

creations-chat 2020-12-04 19:24:39 <@!527092191189925918> if thats a p38 you should make the nose skinner and a tad bit longer

make engines go a bit forward infront of the wings

general 2021-05-12 04:10:44 anyone here got the f8u in war thunder
general 2021-05-12 04:11:12 please tell me it gets better after you unlock wing repair and the aim9d's
general 2021-05-12 14:53:50 m22
general 2021-05-12 14:53:52 thats all you need
general 2021-05-12 14:54:34 the stuarts are also good 
just use the light tanks until you get the non round shermans
general 2021-05-12 14:54:55 that is a very good tank but after volumetric the shells suck ass
general 2021-05-12 14:54:59 armor is very good
general 2021-05-12 14:55:37 oh yea I forgot about that
general 2021-05-12 14:55:49 stuart and the m3 lee
dont play the lee just rush for the shermans
general 2021-05-12 14:56:06 that 15 mph gun stabilizer is paradise
general 2021-05-12 14:56:40 yes I am usa main <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-05-12 14:57:11 ehh id honestly just play the 105 because that armor is so damn nice
general 2021-05-12 14:57:50 besides at that br with the 50 cal you'll just chew the noobs who spawn in their puma or other wheeled things which are common at that br
general 2021-05-12 14:59:13 pz 2c was a very fun tank but it just feels mean
general 2021-05-12 15:00:22 im researching tier 5 france and honestly was a lot more enjoyable than I expected 

but the reload and the poor shrapnal makes me ⚰️
general 2021-05-12 15:01:01 just press space bar for m2 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-05-12 15:02:13 the m103 just made me give up researching into tier 6
general 2021-05-12 15:02:28 I hate the heavies so damn much
general 2021-05-12 15:04:41 the M22 is very good up until id say like 4.0
general 2021-05-12 15:05:09 maybe you can use the m22 past 4.0 but then it becomes more skill based instead of run around and land a stupid shot
general 2021-05-12 15:06:19 it is?? god damn for a tank that kinda sucks imo thats just sad
creations-chat 2021-06-05 19:00:25 yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 16:57:35 is there a way I can somehow put that halfwedge block inside of the cylinder block without exposing motors
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 16:58:22 wait I think I have an idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 17:01:53 nvm it covers up the entire cylinder im just not gonna use the wedge
