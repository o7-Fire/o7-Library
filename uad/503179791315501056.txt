plane-crazy 2019-12-05 11:10:45 and u discintegrate into polygons
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 11:11:38 wait helium reaches that limit?

general 2020-01-13 16:05:37 guys
general 2020-01-13 16:05:40 guyse
general 2020-01-13 16:05:44 G U Y S
general 2020-01-13 16:06:01 i realised why i felt so empty insude
general 2020-01-13 16:06:19 it's because i didn't make you hate me yet...
general 2020-01-13 16:06:21 ...
general 2020-01-13 16:07:52 ShE aSkeD Me: sOn WhEn i GrOw oLd, wiLL yOu Buy MeH a jEt oF gOlD?
general 2020-01-13 16:08:17 hope i changed that
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:12:09 you can put a battleship cannon on a submarine... weather or not it works is a whole other question tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:13:38 oof i wanted to say smthing
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:14:01 the server doesn't like talking about the german moustache man
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:14:18 the moustache man wanted to do that once
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:14:54 but it was too big and bulky and they ended up not building it... not even a prototype
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:15:56 also look at my beautiful creation in general because it's beautiful and you need it in your lives pls
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:54:52 that's not gyro tho .-.
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:55:47 if motor 2 only tried to orient the top half instead of chosing a half automatically it could be used to make a gyro
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:55:58 tbh that's why motor 2's are so laggy
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:56:21 they have in built calculations to know which side to rotate towards the mouse
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:57:23 i have a mech that stabilizes like that
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:57:39 want me to send a wid?
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:58:42 1 sec im gon show my mech from last year that stabilizes like that if i still have it
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:59:43 rickije btw why did u choose to make the motor 2s try calculate which side to aim?
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 16:59:53 just askin'
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:04:44 my question is: why did u take the extra step to make it so that it knows which side to rotate? it is helpful but it makes it glitchier and must have the pilot seat attached
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:07:11 i thought it was gonna pop up the same way an image does
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:07:21 i used the roblox recorder
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:07:46 i'm too lazy to download a recording software
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:08:50 also here's the mech i was talking about that balances with helium and ballast
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:09:07 i wasn't liing
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:09:52 i've built it last year's chrismas event to test out the snow blasters
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:12:44 that's what reminded me of motor 2's
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:13:55 if motor 2's would always try to adjust the same side "the light grey side" to the direction of the mouse we could place it upside down to create a gyro
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:15:28 also my name is Máté Forisek, in hungary we write names backwards
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:15:53 just call me Matthew
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:17:06 mm yes A10 boy~ my flesh loves your 30mm's 😩
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:18:01 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:18:07 the bestest of places
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 17:19:09 bruw i just looked at ur profile pic which inplies your hungarian origin
help 2020-01-13 17:20:45 can u send a vid?
help 2020-01-13 17:20:58 k
help 2020-01-13 17:21:04 send then
help 2020-01-13 17:21:59 it's not as heavy as i thought... i'm thinking
help 2020-01-13 17:22:21 its compact tho
help 2020-01-13 17:23:13 the problem is i don't see much space for customized control surfaces
help 2020-01-13 17:23:58 which part u wanna rotate?
help 2020-01-13 17:24:23 u want it to be able to do a barrel roll?
help 2020-01-13 17:25:57 i mean the only thing that would be enough for that is either rocket engines or water wheels for gyro
help 2020-01-13 17:27:11 how important is the general shape of the craft?
help 2020-01-13 17:27:58 i thought of perhaps putting control surfaces on the back wing
help 2020-01-13 17:29:08 i gtg
help 2020-01-13 17:29:24 it's unexpected family thing sry
help 2020-01-13 17:29:27 bye

general 2020-01-17 17:10:21 maan i really wish there was a block i can use to attach my craft to someone else's
general 2020-01-17 17:10:30 like  a connector block
general 2020-01-17 17:11:17 magnets only work on ur own creation
general 2020-01-17 17:11:26 and they are also really glitchy
general 2020-01-17 17:12:27 we can't rly make coop creations with those :/
general 2020-01-17 17:35:04 i was afk for a bit
general 2020-01-17 17:35:55 i've tried motor based latches before but they slow down both creations and at high speeds just clip trough each other
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 18:09:09 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 18:11:52 i need to hit 10 days
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 18:13:40 hiting things gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 18:32:52 i took my 10 by 10 machine and added a hammer

creations-chat 2020-03-04 16:09:32 hovertank prototype 2.2 | 263 blocks | finally FINALLY after having to wait a whole day i can post this creation! introducing the PIE RND (renamed after a good night's sleep) omnidirectional hovertank! this vehicle is the 2nd ideration of my first hovercraft but with more hover power and firepower! it features 8 axis simetry and with 8 sets of legs each with their individual suspention and a set of 2 hoverpads. it's natural state is upright and it will stay upright even when falling. the design has been updated 2 more times hence the .2 (.1 asthetic changes and block count decrease, .2 improved balance)
i love using this craft and it replaced my bicopter as my goto transport.

hope ya'll like it!

(sidenote: i was told i can ask for ranks here so may i ask for designer? thx in advance!)

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 17:13:40 <@!671156550546751550> nice observation jimbo
help 2020-03-13 05:45:39 <@!399747820078366722> it depends... you probably know that the control surfaces will automatically adjust your plane to have mouse control.

but if you want to build a mouse controlled turret per say you can use motor 2s as they will also try to follow your mouse. keep in mind that motor2s will try to turn the smallest side (turret side) towards your mouse so you can't really make gyros using them
help 2020-03-13 05:46:53 not really hard to use
help 2020-03-13 05:47:14 they only get laggy when u have turrets on turrets on turrets ect
help 2020-03-13 05:48:09 also even trough motor2s have keybindings, those keybinds will do nothing so just ignore them
help 2020-03-13 05:49:04 they are for if you set a motor2 to "servo" which makes it stop following mouse and turns it into a steering hinge instead
help 2020-03-13 08:34:46 Wedges yes

the-dump 2020-03-13 20:45:15 TIL at chemistry class that u can turn raspberry aroma into a liquid with a high ethanol content (around 20%) with just water making it an adult drink! it just doesn't like to dissolve so u may need to warm it up a bit...

(warning: do not actually do this as it might create a really unpleasant oder...)
(warning2: do not actually drink the created substance as the high amount of left over aroma may cause serious kidney problems)
(warning3: oh by the way there's also around 20% pure Vinegar created so if you don't like having your throat burned then i don't really recommend)
(warning4: this really is just a dumb TIL... if you do this your whole house will smell of vinegar, alcohol, and raspberries)
(warning5: seriously don't)
(warning6: if you light any sort of fire near the reaction the forming alcohol vapor may catch fire and or explode)
(warning7: if i had to speculate you're probably too young to drink anyways)
(final note: buying actual drinks is less expensive than the amount of aroma needed anyways so DON'T DO THIS)
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:47:09 chemistry classes are dangeorous
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:49:51 you prob don't have enough aroma for that tho
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:50:08 u need a bit more aroma than water
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:50:54 as the aroma has extra stuff in it that doesn't take place in the reaction
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:55:41 (warning8: do not dare substitute with any other kind of aroma as for example the same experiment with pineapple aroma makes methanol which causes blindness and can easily kill you when overdosed (methanol is also com monlyused in antifreeze)

the-dump 2020-03-16 20:24:15 Now senkens is clearly a defensive one
the-dump 2020-03-16 20:24:59 And oknenko is clearly more of a brute force offence with the quad chopstick attacks
the-dump 2020-03-16 20:33:49 Anyways senkens wins as onkenko is revealing her weakpoint
the-dump 2020-03-16 20:34:22 Her head is only held up by a bit of hair

creations-chat 2020-03-17 21:01:27 I love the concept of a kina "artificial easter egg"
creations-chat 2020-03-17 21:02:01 Since yk the devs don't wanna add those
the-dump 2020-03-17 21:03:07 Bit of autocorrect goodness...
As most people appreciate if it's still need a big meme
the-dump 2020-03-17 21:03:31 i by emoting on me own
the-dump 2020-03-17 21:03:41 Oh they grant extra grip on my leaks
general 2020-03-21 09:21:22 As a lazy idiotic and ignorant European potato, I have nothing to do with the Vietnam war thanks
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:03:55 after a bit of thoinking i about chemicals i have done something that cannot be undone...
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:04:13 
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:05:51 I'm suprised that bloxys still exists
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:07:43 they just really wanted to cringe the heck out of the new roblox steaming service
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:07:51 like brÖ
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:08:57 oh my gosh
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:08:58 NO
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:09:02 NOOO
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:09:35 that's gonna grind your butt so clean you won't even have one anymore
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:10:06 i don't need to worry about toilet paper tho
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:10:31 i can just go out to the garden and collect the fresh spring leaves...
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:13:46 use ice for even cooler cleaning
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:14:19 for big pros you can use liquid nitrogen to freeze the poopoo and just thaw it off with a screwdriver
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:14:58 boot like boot camp eh?
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:15:33 you reminded me of something...
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:15:45 what if i say...
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:15:54 behold the PP
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:15:56 :-
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:16:11 i can make the smol PP :>
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:16:14 :-
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:16:40 i will not abuse this power as i wanna stay on the server if possible
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:17:35 i has an idea again
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:18:01 quite a while ago i have schreenshotted my youtube recommendations
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:18:17 now i will compare them to my up to date one
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:22:51 hmm i even tried refreshing but my youtube front page is not bad enough
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:23:28 i tried it to recommend me at least one video from the click but it wants to be nice
the-dump 2020-03-22 11:24:14 but off course when someone else sees it IRL there are 2 offensive videos in a row
the-dump 2020-03-23 16:33:59 does anyone know roblox games where i can show off my own home made character animations? i can get my animaton ID-s
the-dump 2020-03-23 16:41:01 i don't really know lua you see
plane-crazy 2020-03-27 06:50:27 Sometimes I see images of creations with really detailed backgrounds so are there shaders for roblox?
And if they are...are they legal to use?
(A shader manipulates your data so it could be considered a client side hack)
the-dump 2020-03-28 19:26:09 
the-dump 2020-03-28 19:26:28 this is my album cover
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:02:41 makin' pixel art be like...
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:03:24 i was thinking of using the x9 blocks and the bottom side of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:03:37 but let me try that
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:04:16 tried it
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:04:20 didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:04:29 imma just use the alternatives
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:13:03 interesting thing
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:13:20 i finished a full layer of blocks on the baseplate
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:13:28 the block count is 2601
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:13:47 sqrt 2601=51
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:14:09 the base plates are 51x51 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-30 10:14:27 so next time you need this info you can remember
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:20:34 I'm meant to be sleeping right now but I just can't do it as my head just made up a complete lecture that would make for a script for a Vsauce video
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:36:19 I was gonna write my think down but after 3½ pages worth of text later I realised no one was ever gonna read it
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:37:16 If you're wondering it was a monologue about plasma
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:37:46 .
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:38:09 I shortened it a lot
the-dump 2020-03-30 20:41:20 Plasma is created in:
-the sun
-technology stuff
-fire
-thunderbolts
-your parents' old TV
-your parents' new TV

-my blanket
-the slide at McDonalds

the-dump 2020-03-31 10:34:46 thank ya discord for messing up my @-s
the-dump 2020-03-31 15:14:18 just a regular schreenshot
the-dump 2020-03-31 17:53:45 in that video <@!340543153922768906> posted with the cat... the music that starts playing sounds like something from "baba is you"
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:07:35 Okay autocorrect time
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:07:48 Let's see what she has to say
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:08:51 Excuse me I was in the process of autocorrect
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:09:24 "I"
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:10:03 "a bowl of the data so it could be considered a bowl of creations with a bowl of creations with backgrounds so are the game so high danger "
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:10:20 To throw meat against the data making it classify
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:10:45 I see images of creations with really detailed background
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:11:08 The dumb
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:11:14 That fits me
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:11:35 "Just made the data making it a meet kód "
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:12:13 The fascinating thing is that autocorrect decided to swap the language because of the word "meet"
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:12:39 As meet is the video chatting thingy we use for school
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:13:14 I'm on the phone
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:13:30 Only the phone has autocorrect
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:14:45 The autocorrect also wants to start a Hungarian sentence with "nem" which means "no"
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:15:01 "Nem tudtam "
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:15:26 Yes
the-dump 2020-04-01 00:16:25 If you look at my screenshot I posted a bit ago on this channel you can clearly see that I'm yes years old

When you press the activation key again it stops.

It's less convenient but maybe it still helps somewhat...

creations-chat 2020-04-14 07:35:59 it takes about 5 to 10 mins to fold
creations-chat 2020-04-14 07:38:35 and of course when i'm trying to fold fast it breaks
creations-chat 2020-04-14 07:38:54 during my testing i figured there's about a 1 in 6 chance of it breaking
creations-chat 2020-04-14 08:57:22 people asked me to make a gif of it folding so i did! sorry for taking long but guess when my father decided to make me fix the broken coat hanger... and yes the FPS is this bad...

Story in detail: He was stating that "he was testing his GPU preformance", the whole server was complaining to him. I told him politely that there is software that measures preformance precisely as well as roblox games to test the preformance but he refused. I then proceeded to tell him that if he really wants to test in plane crazy at least buy a VIP server for it as if he has money for a new GPU he also has for a VIP server since it's not that expensive. He said he doesn't spend money on robux and proceeded to reload his lag machine making the servermates asking in all caps for him to stop. I told him that i will contact rick about this, in response he quickly left the server, but by that time i already had the pic and his user.
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 10:09:38 thank you rick!
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 10:09:56 looks like a roblox ad now that i think of it XD

general 2020-04-20 08:30:59 he looks like that slime from monsters vs aliens
general 2020-04-20 08:31:05 was he called bob?
general 2020-04-20 08:31:15 i think he was called bob
general 2020-04-20 08:32:00 whenever i have a dream it's always weird ass and i remember my dreams for a long time
general 2020-04-20 08:32:23 and some of my dreams are in the same world/universe
general 2020-04-20 08:32:29 i could draw a dream map
general 2020-04-20 08:36:34 working on me map

creations-chat 2020-04-25 19:19:57 SO... with the new horn sounds i made a (really poorly made) piano!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adqh2SXwbd8
general 2020-05-21 09:15:37 can somebody help me?
general 2020-05-21 09:15:38 one of our english exercises is a crossword kina thing and i just can't get one of the words
- - - - - - s - "making mistakes because you aren't careful"
general 2020-12-06 14:14:21 I've been gone for a long while and i see a new rank got added
general 2020-12-06 14:14:31 the helicopter one
general 2020-12-06 14:15:04 i do have my old bicopter that fits the criteria
general 2020-12-06 14:15:52 doe does it have to be the propellor blades specifically or can i use control surfaces or tilted wing pannels?
help 2020-12-06 14:22:26 uhh does the helicopter technician rank allow for propellers to be made using control surfaces or tilted wing pannels
help 2020-12-06 14:22:41 or only the propellor blade block?
general 2020-12-06 14:33:41 question can i use wing pannels rotated with motor 2's as the rotor blades for the helicopter rank?
general 2020-12-06 14:35:10 u will use rotors like this for funsies
general 2020-12-06 14:36:54 are bicopters allowed?
general 2020-12-06 14:37:49 dunno
general 2020-12-06 14:37:59 bicopters are quite easy to do
general 2020-12-06 14:38:30 si far i got this
general 2020-12-06 15:50:12 you know when you make a build look good and stuff
general 2020-12-06 15:50:24 you do everything right
general 2020-12-06 15:50:43 but then the motor gods decide to crap on your face
general 2020-12-06 15:51:17 and you watch as your beloved creation tears itself apart, then proceeds to fling you at a speed of 1214145643
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 16:43:49 it flies :D
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 16:44:55 quick question what is the highest overall speed that can be considered "hovering in place"?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 16:47:01 how is that hovering in place?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 16:47:15 you're zooming trough the multiverse at that point
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 16:59:41 am tryna get the helicopter technician but i don't know how much i have to polish on my choppa to make it fit the criteria
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:00:36 it takes off at a 80° angle and can hover whilist going up with 8sps
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:02:10 i didn't want to make it front and back symmetric cause that's lame
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:02:33 what's the maximum deviation from 90° takeoff angle allowed?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:02:56 i'm going bonkers
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:03:40 also it needs a paintjob
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:07:33 well hats off to those whom can make a heli that has an exact 0° deviation when taking off
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:07:58 helium isn't allowed lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:08:18 and i don't wanna do cringe simmetry i want to make it look stylish
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:10:00 it can also do a kind of like takeoff that's just confusing
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:10:33 good job my guy
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 17:14:28 guess i'll just not fix it and move onto painting
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:51:42 bicopter go BRRRR
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:53:58 imagine if plane crazy had logic gates
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:54:47 magic machines that do smart stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:54:56 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:55:26 i could program a calculator in build world but it takes so LOOOONGG
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:56:40 with logic gates and sensors you could build autonomous stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:57:33 you could make a minigame where you have automated flying targets u need to shoot down
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:57:52 or an army of smart robots that do your bidding
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:58:20 the tutorial sucks
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:59:28 OMG with logic gates it'd be easier to make transformers
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 10:59:56 and less laggy since weird mechanisms could be replaced with motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:00:28 i do wonder...
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:01:40 we could make a tournament with autonimous robot fighting
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:02:16 
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:02:47 piss bote nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:30:30 upside down smiley face
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:30:47 well a very evil smiley face but smiley face nontheless
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:31:09 just gonna turn it upside down and invert the colors
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:31:32 
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:54:10 did you vertically mirror it and re invert it?
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 11:58:39 cause the propeller of the easter event island is on the other side
help 2020-12-07 12:55:41 ?rhelp

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 07:06:42 christmas really is cancelled
general 2021-03-09 20:44:04 .
general 2021-03-09 20:44:21 okay finally i found how to remove the contest role
general 2021-03-09 20:44:29 i hate how hard that was to figure out
general 2021-04-01 11:04:43 hol up this ain't lookin' like gold
general 2021-04-01 11:04:50 could this be....
general 2021-04-01 11:04:55 fool's gold?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 11:19:12 bruh i decided to just paint me bicopter pink but it actually works what the hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 11:50:00 i'm blue daba dee daba die
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:04:02 i like how everyone wants the gold bars and it took me 2 minutes to find them by myself
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:14:14 oh now i feel like making some sort of pvp craft that 's just annoying as hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:15:13 i'm thinking of a machine that uses motor 2 for omni directional flight and goes at extreme speed with rocket spam
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:17:12 oh wait if i make the flier a 4 engine thing with a wing tipped tail it won't turn on a dime but i could use it to aim
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:22:24 step 1 complete: fast and annoying flying machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:31:45 cringe machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:32:15 well yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:32:31 i feel my soul burning building it
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:33:03 but i just wanna play PvP mode and to do that i need something that can keep up with all the cancer i see there
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:33:12 basically beating cancer with more cancer
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:33:56 i hate to admit but yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:34:00 
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:34:35 so basically i'm tryba fight fire with nuclear fusion
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:35:07 it's just more fire
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:35:11 fire all the waay
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:36:14 don't you get the deal about the gold bars?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:36:21 it's april fools day
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:36:31 so the gold is actually fool's gold
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 12:36:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 13:15:09 Oi my craft i dubbed "þe cancer fish" is finished so time to go to pvp (i'm aware that how is pronounced, it's on purpose)
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 13:15:30 no i don't þink i will
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 13:16:03 listen i have made a lot of good looking crafts, let me make one that looks bad for once
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 13:16:36 i just wanna purge people in Pvp with uselessly complicated machines
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 20:39:44 the laser emmiter still works
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:17:55 uhm i'm working on another one of my omni directional hovercraft, and i don't know if i should put a mag drive in it
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:18:10 because there's this problem
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:19:23 it's way too fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:20:44 damn, all terrain dingdong
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:23:27 why do all my hovercraft always look better underneath
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:23:50 also the thing with the rocket engines will be changed up

general 2022-06-13 21:20:12 did anyone else got pinged by some scam bot?
general 2022-06-13 21:24:25 
general 2022-06-13 21:25:29 bro we all won a suspiciously high amount of bitcoin in some random site noone's heard of and it's definitely not going to try to steal your identity if you go there
general 2023-05-23 14:34:34 is using macro tools to control creations allowed?
general 2023-05-23 14:35:26 I love when one person says "no" and the other says "yes"
general 2023-05-23 14:35:39 frick it, I'm just gonna use the macro
general 2023-05-23 14:36:06 I am literally intending to do the exact same thing
general 2023-05-23 14:36:29 you use what's called a macro tool, (for example AutoHotkey) which can simulate keypresses
general 2023-05-23 14:36:42 an autoclicker also qualifies as a macro tool
general 2023-05-23 14:37:39 I'm gonna try make a C++ script to create a keypress sequence to fire my firework launchers in an offset order essentially quadrupling their base firerate
general 2023-05-23 14:37:47 "like a minigun"
general 2023-05-23 14:38:12 Do you have visual studio by any chance?
general 2023-05-23 14:38:54 well then you can look up how to simulate keypresses and write your own program to do it for you, or you can wait for my dumb ah to make my script
general 2023-05-23 15:11:42 roblox does not detect my keypresses from C++
general 2023-05-23 15:11:58 Idk what's the matter with that
general 2023-05-23 15:12:23 discord does though
f4ffffff1ffffffff2ffffffff3ffffffff4ffffffff1fffffff2ffffffff3ffffffff4ffffffff1ffffffff2fffffffff3ffffffff4ffffffff1ffffffff2ffffffff3ffffffff4ffffffff1f
general 2023-05-23 15:12:41 when I hold f it plays 1234 in sequence
general 2023-05-23 15:12:54 but roblox does not detect it
general 2023-05-23 15:17:22 my own macro for sequencial fire
general 2023-05-23 15:18:07 Roblox does detect my input now, but doesn't handle it the way I expect it to, one of the keys is bringing up the dance menu
general 2023-05-23 15:18:54 it does work in chat but not on my build
general 2023-05-23 15:29:22 I'm sorry I can't figure out why roblox doesn't detect my keypresses the way I expect it to, but I know AHK works so I'll make the script in AHK instead
general 2023-05-23 17:25:07 excuse me when was I spamming?
general 2023-05-23 17:25:28 Is there a channel for that? (it was text)
general 2023-05-23 17:25:33 code
general 2023-05-23 17:26:24 it was this piece of garbagely written code
general 2023-05-23 17:26:59 Why are you even messaging in that case?
general 2023-05-23 17:27:29 too lazy to learn AHK
general 2023-05-23 17:27:44 funnily enough AHK is written in this language (c++)
general 2023-05-23 17:27:52 but AHK uses it's own language
general 2023-05-23 17:28:41 c++ is general purpose, and (as I have stated before) AHK is literally developped in c++
general 2023-05-23 17:29:03 I don't wanna learn another fricking language just to use macros
general 2023-05-23 17:29:23 c++ is more memory efficient than AHK anyways since AHK is a layer above C++
general 2023-05-23 17:30:02 true but still, if I don't need ahk why should I learn ahk?
general 2023-05-23 17:30:19 I just don't need it
general 2023-05-23 17:31:08 I respect your opinion, but I simply do not need AHK, that's all
general 2023-05-23 17:31:45 I don't wanna learn it, I don't need it for something as simple as this, and it's likely not gonna be faster for me than c++ anyways
general 2023-05-23 17:34:46 In hungary (my county) there's only one pronoun for the 3rd person, and that's the letter ő
general 2023-05-24 21:43:08 what color should I paint my plane?
general 2023-05-24 21:44:07 that's the thing, I don't know what color scheme to use
general 2023-05-24 21:44:32 on my ugly ah propeller plane with the wings that go way too high upwards
general 2023-05-24 21:44:35 this
general 2023-05-24 21:46:32 it's stable enough where I can walk around on it while it's flying
general 2023-05-24 21:48:43 it's studs per second
general 2023-05-24 21:49:10 roblox measures everything in studs and studs per second
general 2023-05-24 21:51:19 flying a plane for hours can be tiresome so It's nice to be able to walk around a bit and get a bit of exercise
general 2023-05-24 21:53:58 roblox characters were originally based around lego figurines, so a stud is about 4.8mm
general 2023-05-24 21:54:12 wait no i am dumb
general 2023-05-24 21:54:29 8mm
general 2023-05-24 21:54:48 cause the stud isn't just the size of the stud but the size of the entire brick in roblox
general 2023-05-24 21:55:33 but if you wanna do some conversions, an r6 roblox avatar is just a smidge over 5 studs tall
general 2023-05-24 21:59:49 I ended up consulting a random color palette generator website
general 2023-05-24 22:01:45 I will probably adjust the colors a bit but this is solid for a start
general 2023-05-25 01:41:35 I painted my plane
creations-chat 2023-05-25 03:06:37 <@744986493684285471> Try resending your message in <#384025409945337856> because the bot didn't add reactions

general 2023-05-25 11:00:18 I don't really know how to explain it properly
general 2023-05-25 11:00:34 but I want a better alternative to having 200 motors in one build
general 2023-05-25 11:00:55 it would be WAAAY easier to just have one special block where you can actually set an offset with numbers
general 2023-05-25 11:01:35 you cannot use piston locking the same way you can use motor locking
general 2023-05-25 11:01:51 good luck trying to clip parts into each other with pistons
general 2023-05-25 11:02:09 good luck achieving fancy angles with pistons
general 2023-05-25 11:02:45 are ya'll guys masochists?
general 2023-05-25 11:02:57 have you heard of something called "convenience"?
general 2023-05-25 11:03:28 tell me you enjoy having to build elaborate and gigantic towers of motors in a build
general 2023-05-25 11:05:05 still though, it wouldn't be hard to make it easier, roblox already has a type of constraint that can do the thing I want
general 2023-05-25 11:05:30 weld constraints can literally be set to work on an offset
general 2023-05-25 11:06:45 and instead of having to use 120 motors, and a ton of bombs and smoke trail pieces, you could make a detailed build with like 10 of those offsetter pieces
general 2023-05-25 11:08:25 a motor lock and piston lock combined, except way less complicated to set up and using exponentially less blocks
general 2023-05-25 11:09:36 It would take X Y Z values, allowing you to use one block for what normally would have required like 30 motors
general 2023-05-25 11:11:22 the whole reason I want this feature is that so builds don't have to look like this
general 2023-05-25 11:11:26 look at that hideous mess
general 2023-05-25 11:11:36 look at the hundreds of redundant parts
general 2023-05-25 11:12:40 # I have a new idea, let's remove all of the engines except for the small propeller engine because enough small propeller engines can already do what other engines can
general 2023-05-25 11:13:35 my point is, yes motor lock is already there and it's bad, just like the small propeller engine, but that doesn't mean we don't need something better
general 2023-05-25 11:14:04 <@448677698773057547>
general 2023-05-25 11:15:24 you know what fine, keep the motor lock glitch as is, but also add the new block anyways
general 2023-05-25 11:15:31 win-win for both sides
general 2023-05-25 11:15:41 you can continue with your complex weird towers
general 2023-05-25 11:16:23 this is why I made that comment about engines, just because they're "redundant" doesn't mean they aren't useful
general 2023-05-25 11:17:15 again, instead of having to play 3D tetris around your girthy motor tower you could just use a couple offsetters to make a clean looking clipped build
general 2023-05-25 11:18:17 that's your point, I'm trying to get rid of a problem that you're proud to be able to solve?
general 2023-05-25 11:18:53 I wasn't the one to ping myself after I left that suggestion unassumingly
general 2023-05-25 11:19:56 having to build around all the exposed motors
general 2023-05-25 11:20:08 you were the one to use the term "problem solving"
general 2023-05-25 11:21:31 then why do you call it problem solving, are you solving nothing?
general 2023-05-25 11:21:54 you're either admitting that it is a problem or calling yourself useless, either way you made this trap for yourself
general 2023-05-25 11:22:38 well anyways, it wouldn't hurt you to have an extra offsetter block that makes your skill redundant
general 2023-05-25 11:23:27 Ah yes building games shouldn't be intuitive and self explanatory
general 2023-05-25 11:24:05 let's make plane crazy as hard to use as designing a real airplane **It would be a perfectly fine model for a roblox game fr**
general 2023-05-25 11:25:25 thank you for kindly telling me to fuck off, appreciated 👍
general 2023-05-25 11:26:40 We can keep motor lock, but I still want the alternative block

I know glitches can sometimes make for good features, like bud powering in minecraft java edition
general 2023-05-25 11:27:17 I did not know the community was this protective of their precious little glitch
general 2023-05-25 11:27:24 in retrospect I was foolish
general 2023-05-25 11:28:42 ya'll are tearing me apart for making a suggestion WYM
general 2023-05-25 11:28:56 I'm not holding rickye at gunpoint to remove the motor locks now
general 2023-05-25 11:29:02 I just made a fucking suggestion
general 2023-05-25 11:29:17 and I offered a replacement that would be way easier to use for the casual playerbase
general 2023-05-25 11:31:01 well, a block that can actually be given coordinates for more precise offsets, and without the need to build gigantic 3x1 towers
general 2023-05-25 11:31:57 nah, F3X is a way more advanced system than anything possible in plane crazy
general 2023-05-25 11:33:16 but also I can't feed inputs into F3X
general 2023-05-25 11:34:16 what did I say
general 2023-05-25 11:34:22 wait a minute I think I know
general 2023-05-25 11:34:40 let me test this
general 2023-05-25 11:34:49 LOOOL
general 2023-05-25 11:35:34 They banned the word of the game that's just plane crazy with more cool stuff but also for some reason hinges break under stress making it less useful for mechanical builds
general 2023-05-25 11:35:49 that's hilarious
general 2023-05-25 11:37:29 lol
general 2023-05-25 11:39:24 I wanna see that fire
general 2023-05-25 11:45:13 I just realized, that game actually has the part I wanted + logic gates and sensors
general 2023-06-05 15:31:14 umm, <#623337136267067393> is closed, and rickje isn't accepting reports in dms, so effectively there is no reporting system whatsoever
general 2023-06-05 15:31:38 and well, someone is flying a... **very unconventionally shaped** flying machine
general 2023-06-05 15:33:21 it has... two roughly spherical fuel tanks on the back, an elongated chassis...
general 2023-06-05 15:34:27 thank you dyno
general 2023-06-06 15:50:36 Will pc2 have any sort of race mechanic?
general 2023-06-06 15:51:28 I hate the english language smh
general 2023-06-06 15:52:43 anyways, what I've meant was trailmakers-esque checkpoint based racing
general 2023-06-06 15:54:45 the PC community truely feels like a group of cavemen when it comes to discussions...
