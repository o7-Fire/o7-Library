plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:10:23 VERY important
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:10:35 and leaving the blocks there will ruin the camera anyways
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:10:44 So many issues and bugs to work out

plane-crazy 2020-06-12 16:47:00 a mech is not mechanical
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 16:47:09 A mech is legs arm body
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 16:47:40 Something mechanical is a re-useble spring, a battery, or my camera

general 2020-10-30 23:52:54 ok dyno
general 2020-10-30 23:53:37 I was going to suggest a form of whitelist
general 2020-10-30 23:53:43 But
general 2020-10-30 23:53:43 Not like building on peoples bases
general 2020-10-30 23:53:56 Being able to be affected by other peoples parts
general 2020-10-30 23:53:57 So like
general 2020-10-30 23:54:08 A magnet can pick up someone else device if they whitelist you
bot-central 2020-10-30 23:54:32 ?rhelp
general 2020-10-30 23:59:21 Wait, To get Helicopter Technition, Do drones count?
general 2020-10-30 23:59:56 I have a drone that hovers in place, uses no helium or hovers, and is powered by just 5 motors per propeller
general 2020-10-31 00:00:10 One for straif, one for forward/backward, one for turning, and one for up/down
general 2020-10-31 00:00:22 aswell as one for Overhaul (Cargo Drone)
general 2020-11-06 00:06:52 What does "Motorlock is working again" mean? Does that mean it no longer goes half-way when spawning or it stopped doing that and now it goes half-way when spawning again
general 2020-11-17 20:43:48 I made a seat wave machine its funny
general 2020-11-17 20:43:55 it launches a wall of seats
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:07 What is the best way to propell yourself without using engines or rockets/jets/etc
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:24 without engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:35 Conveyor Engines, Hover Engines, Magnet Engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:41 Wheels count
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:46 I dont want them
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:07:55 With w h a t
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:07 I am using helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:08 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:12 Only to make it lighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:21 Is there a way to reduce air resistance
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:24 Its a dart
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:08:45 Thats actually genious
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:09:00 Well
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:09:05 I do want to be able to angle it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:09:06 and
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:09:11 Rotating arm is kinda RNG
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:10:04 "Conveyor Engines, Hover Engines, Magnet Engines"
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:10:12 No engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:10:35 No, Parachutes do
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:21:57 Ive Invented a new system
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:21:59 I think
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:22:07 Rail-engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:22:18 Engines, But they only work for a limited time
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:22:26 Railgun would prob just be easier
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:38:04 No
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:38:14 I put something in a cage

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:40:09 Those are the Mesh ID's for the wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:40:31 Put them in your own roblox studio if you want
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:40:40 What other objects should I make for this game?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:43:11 I cant make a map

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:46:05 If I could have a place to send these meshes I would be happy to make more for the devs
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:47:14 I am not a dev

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:47:47 I wish I was a dev
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 03:47:52 this game would have 2x the blocks

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:05:08 I added shade smooth
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:06:47 Does anybody know why when I convert a shade-smooth model into a mesh it deletes the curve?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:15:34 I just realised how little segments are in a round wedge in
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:15:59 There are a total of  segments
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:06 5
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:29 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:30 BRUH
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:34 Time to uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:38 Down-grade my model
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:16:39 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:18:11 If I were to turn the round corner wedge into a mesh (which I am), How many segments would I need?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:18:23 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:20:29 hai
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:20:53 I think the answer is 40....
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:21:02 I need 10 rings (5x2)
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:21:11 Then I need 10 segments (10x4)
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:21:53 Never heard of that happening before sorry
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:25:19 New meshes are lookin way more, Plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:25:20 Than
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:25:23 Perfectly round
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:27:35 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:33:11 ah jeez
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 06:33:19 Now my model wont export as .obj
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:40:08 Is my mesh not working because its technically using the Inner part of a sphere?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:40:12 or wtf
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:40:45 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:40:48 Thats blender
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:41:23 Thats roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:42:31 Fixed it
help 2020-11-24 07:43:24 hi noyza
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:45:39 i now have myself 2 Plane crazy friendly custom Round Corner Wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:45:42 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:46:09 They were very smooth before
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:46:12 and then i realised
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:46:21 a plane crazy round wedge has 5 segments
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:47:22 Just realised why i have the "Dev updates tag"
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:47:34 i wanted Dev updates
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:48:33 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:48:49 Again, If I were a dev there would be WAY more parts
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:16 I can do a bunch of cool stuff because I learned how to import from blender
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:28 More parts means more save data
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:36 well
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:39 if your using the parts
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:43 It wont cause lag
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:49:55 Because I THINK the parts go in Replicated Storage
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:50:06 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:50:41 uh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:50:49 no?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:50:57 thats not how it works lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:55:52 it is so easy to import models into roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:56:31 Brand new mesh I made, its a hollow semi-circle
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:57:21 but why use unions
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:57:24 when
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:57:46 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:57:48 THIS
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:57:51 is better
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:58:24 I just used boolean on a sphere after cutting it in half
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:58:30 More half blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:58:33 Do you want like
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:58:37 1/4 block?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:59:03 that

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:59:40 Like Half-Wedge 2?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:59:45 but
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 07:59:47 1x2?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:00:56 i put my character inside a ball
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:01:30 roller time
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:02:51 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:03:27 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:03:33 You have to export it to a .obj
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:03:37 Then
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:04:07 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:04:13 Make a mesh part
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:04:31 Click the little button next to "Mesh ID"
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:04:48 The pick your mesh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:05:05 Do Shift + Windows + S
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:05:15 Shift + Windows + S
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:05:21 You take a selective screenshot
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:05:52 I think any windows will work
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:05:58 Shift + Windows Key + S

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:08:46 Why are you rendering it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:09:03 You can insert an image and expect it to be 3D
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:09:12 You have to export the model as a .obj
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:09:43 File > Export > Wavefront (.obj)
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:10:30 Are you making the Mclaren that will take 3 hours or are you Rendering it?

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:45:37 i live in fear of that now
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:46:46 I really want my meshes in the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:46:50 it sounds easy but
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:46:55 You gotta make the GUI
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:46:58 the ability to place it
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:47:01 a limit of how many
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:47:08 whatever coding junk
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:48:04 !

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:58:47 :/
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:59:07 Ive made more Round Corner Wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:59:21 The round corner wedges in this game only have 5 segments
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:59:41 These are more accurate
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:00:02 We have triangle corner wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:00:09 We dont have the inner triangle wedge

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:00:32 Also what software r u using
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:01:02 Thats robocraft lmao?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:01:06 Im using blender
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:01:11 I deleted robocraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:01:21 It turned fun to Pay-To-Win garbo
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:02:37 I like how the Inner Round Wedge didnt want to import properly, So I just gave it a 0m solidifier
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:02:56 I really want to import something into roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:03:18 for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:03:42 I made some round wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:04:39 I would love to send rickje models but I also dont want to et banned
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:05:15 I would also love the Modeler role but apparently there was a conflict or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:07:11 I dont think they have the ability to make me the role
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:08:09 the issue is
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:08:25 > Q: Can I get the Modeler or Inventor rank?
> A: No. The Modeler and Inventor ranks were made unobtainable due to controversy surrounding how a user is granted the rank, although we may make it obtainable again in the future.
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:08:29 I cant
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:08:35 yet
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:10:54 dang
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:11:49 Hey Robo, Is there a place I can go or person I can talk to to submit models though? I made some models and imported the to roblox, They are some round corner wedges I made that fit plane crazys round wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:12:57 Yeah makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:13:06 sad
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:13:40 :/
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:13:54 i just make 3D models for anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:14:24 Ill probably make models for my own game
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:14:25 Well
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:14:27 thanks for the help
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:14:29 cya
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:14:33 goin to bed its 2am
bug-reports 2020-11-24 22:42:14 That is 4 motor-locked medium propellers, its impossible to add more because that is every possible combo
general 2020-11-25 03:43:24 
general 2020-11-25 03:43:30 making terrain using meshes
general 2020-11-25 03:43:34 I want to see what I can do
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 16:58:26 we should have a challenge for who can make the fastest train
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 16:58:36 the only rule is that it cant de-rail
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:09:12 Is it possible to have a drone fly forward at a certain angle without the use of gyros and all that real life stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:09:49 cheating
help 2021-01-11 02:13:33 Is it possible to make a drone fly at a certain angle without using gyros and all that real life stuff blah blah?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:27:14 Im going to finish my working camera project
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:27:22 its a mechanical camera
help 2021-01-11 02:31:26 thats what I dont want sadly
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:47:23 I've done it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:47:27 I've made a camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:51:17 Its currently 11x2 im going to make it 11x11
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:51:23 and then im going to take pictures with it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:52:33 my favorite geographical monument is big ben, that thing in korea
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:53:40 I love that image because that person is just so... "bruh"
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:53:44 like
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:54:07 London is the most english country you can get
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 02:54:15 or is it a city?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:27:31 I spent a full hour wqorking on my camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:27:34 and i built it wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:28:02 The way it is right now, If i were to put in the anchors, it would collide with the thing its taking a picture of
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:28:27 There is only one hope for my build
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:28:38 and that hope is gone because I know it wont work either
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:29:32 What a camera in plane crazy looks like
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:59:15 I got good news and bad news for the camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:59:27 Good news: The camera works and can take pictures
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:59:49 Bad news: The camera is very laggy and because of the amount of physics collisions, the pistons decide they dont want to take a picture
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 03:59:55 And so
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 04:00:00 ima leave it for tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 04:00:10 1740 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 04:00:16 for an 11x11 camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 00:24:04 Anything heavier than a Ballast block (10)?
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:16:50 Oh? I get a message from my firend
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:16:52 what is it?
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:16:55 
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:20:50 
the-dump 2021-01-21 19:21:15 
general 2021-01-21 19:21:46 are yall talking about noyza?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:13:11 Big Lego or Small Lego? Bigger will be bigger to place but Smaller are going to be built faster (And take up less storage)
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:15:22 Lego I can build with, with a cargo drone
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:16:10 aight
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:36:54 What we need in plane crazy is half cylinder 2 up
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:11:08 my lego cargo drone is complete
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:11:12 I can build anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:11:27 I need to build a floating brick/floating lego platform now
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 10:23:25 is it possible to get a really compact 3x3 platform made out of 5x5 tiles that unfolds from a 5x5 space?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 10:23:40 im making a lego platform i can airdrop into the water
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 10:24:51 they can be space no more and no less than 1 block apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:51:52 If the game is softcoded, i wouldnt mind making 3D models
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:54:44 Have you ever considered this making this a realm game, outside roblox?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 20:55:36 Looking forward to PC2, for now im going to continue to play Factorio, good anouncment to see
general 2022-03-03 09:00:31 Ive been gone for AWHILE, anything about Plane Crazy 2? I would love to check it out
general 2022-03-03 09:01:29 Oh, looks like its out soon
general 2022-03-03 09:01:44 i was about to use :RRpog: and then I realised I cant
general 2022-03-03 09:02:47 hopefully it comes out when I have a better PC
general 2022-03-03 09:03:38 ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:51:37 has anyone ever made something I call the "Infinity Module"?

Im currently, infinitely, gaining 1,000,000 speed per second
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:51:54 I just reached 1,000,000,000 speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:52:01 and counting
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:52:27 Ill see if I can get the speed to be higher
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:52:35 I found out how to charge it more effieciently
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:53:06 
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:53:11 <@718224997570838641>
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:53:25 Its just a bunch of 0 Damping, Max stiffness, Min length suspension
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:53:30 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 23:57:24 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 00:00:30 
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 00:05:57 I went so fast it actually broke roblox apparently
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 00:06:05 that or an admin is in my game and :char'd me
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 00:08:03 
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 08:08:12 Does this game support VR or am i crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 08:08:39 i swear to god I saw someone just flying around in VR once
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:50:03 A new record!
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:54:25 just "e"?
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:54:36 or something like `1E+15`
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:54:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:55:00 something like `1E+15` means 1,000,000,000,000,000
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:55:05 1 + 15 zeros
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:55:37 Mine is `~4E+14`
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 20:56:35 I think the biggest mathimatical number I've ever had to use was `60 * 512!`
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 04:18:25 Im still going crazy over this, I swear this wasnt a dream

Is there any way to play this game in VR? I remember seeing someone in VR and most the server going crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 04:18:34 Like, I've tried to join with PCVR and it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:48:58 I made something really cool and useless les go!
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:49:14 its a gearbox that has Forward and Reverse
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:49:23 i should probably add more gears to it
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:51:09 im not even a car nerd I just love mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:58:35 oh my god I just realised why people in my older mentions reply to me so weird
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 11:59:00 > oh my god I just realised why people in my older mentions reply to me so weird
<@524421250848784395> 

Its before the discord replying system, back when people did this instead
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 13:53:46 les goooooo

Gearbox with 3 gears + reverse
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 13:53:55 Red is Driver, Blue is output, both cannot move
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 13:54:07 it takes so long to switch gears lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:23:21 i made a 2000 sphere confetti cannon
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:23:41 I launched them into the air and they went so high up they can be seen as flashing pixels
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:25:13 oh my god
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:25:39 you can have up to 28000 of each block my changing material
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:29:11 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:29:12 infinite
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:29:14 i think
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:06 awhile ago I posted a screenshot of my gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:14 well, someone made a mechanical car with one gear
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:15 and so
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:17 
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:22 now I have a mechanic car with 2 gears
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:45 nope
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:41:53 the only slipping issue happens with the rear wheels
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:42:03 because its the only one that has a sideways gear
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:42:12 everything else is connected with a very snug system I designed
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:42:17 alr gimme a minute
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:45:21 Next thing to add is a clutch and a higher torque engine lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:45:57 I deleted a gear on it because, like I said, the only slippage issue comes with the sideways gear there
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:47:48 want me to isolate the gearbox?
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:48:17 only possible with text signs tho, because you cant put the axle through the cylinders lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 22:48:33 would be cool for PC2 to add proper gears
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 23:06:26 How much torque do 4 Super Rocket Engines in a 3x3 circle actually provide?
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 23:06:45 because apparently its less than 0.5
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 00:23:27 3 Gear, Constant-mesh gearbox

(Technically 4, but 2 of them are 1:1)
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 00:23:40 1:1, 5:3, 3:5, 1:1
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 00:29:00 need to add reverse now
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 19:05:23 reverse gearbox, idk why I didnt think of this earlier
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 19:54:39 my reverse gear doesnt carry nearly enough torque, damn
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:51:32 how do cars give drive wheels suspension
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:51:36 it confuses me
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:51:39 like
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:52:01 both wheels need to stay connected to the drive axle without going off-center
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:52:10 but also have individual suspension
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:01:04 they are alot harder to do in plane crazy i know that
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:02:04 huh
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:02:16 I want my "realistic" car to be as good as possible lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:02:24 rn it has an engine and 2 gears
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:02:36 rear wheel drive
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:03:00 sadly my reverse gear technic uses a system that uses ALOT of torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:03:05 which means it wont be efficient
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:03:17 this game does NOT like when you put gears sideways
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:04:05 my reverse gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:00:08 i dont think they are ever changing the PC1 map
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:00:16 but ima be very excited to see the PC2 rails
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:00:25 PC1 rails are so dumb lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:00:33 the sharpest fucking bends ever
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:00:55 goes from trainstation to airport only, in the most inneffeciant path
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:01:02 I want to see some (optional) tunnels
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:01:05 that go through terrain
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:01:13 I say options like, one track goes over the hill, one goes through
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:01:18 incase you have a tall train
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:36:29 can you show me what this looks like (an hour later)?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:37:41 oof
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:47:08 So i made this realistic suspension, idk how efficient I made it, but the issue is, it requires so much force to rotate I cant use my gear system
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:47:25 is there a more efficient way of a universal joint?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:47:29 a double one that is
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:50:59 the suspension is made so it rotates with the drive wheel, regardless of the height difference
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:52:52 its not the suspension thats the issue, its the fact I cant rotate the drive gear because of the amount of force it needs
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 06:54:53 maybe, idk tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:00:36 8 rockets aint enough
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:04:04 idk if its force or slippage anymore
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:04:09 gear is slipping alot tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:05:24 it shouldnt be too hard to turn
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:05:34 i mean the front wheels roll freely when the car drives
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:15:14 kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:15:40 i want to make a super realistic car
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 07:16:08 and thats a major issue,biggest flaw rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:12:13 double univeral joint uses alot of torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:14:37 Is there a more efficient way of making a universal joint?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:14:54 I cant just "keep the motor torque at 10000" because its going to be connected to gears, which is not in direction connection to the motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 19:18:16 - Create it yourself
or
- Have the owner invite you
or
- Be friends with the owner AND have them set "Friends can join" to True
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:31:21 all of the issues I had with torque on my car suspension
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:31:27 was solved by rotating the axle 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:31:35 it made it atleast 35x more effiecient
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:31:37 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 22:11:18 after awhile I made a pretty smart gear clutch system
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 22:11:31 its litterally just a single locked motor with 0 torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 22:12:09 when you dont press the keybind, its solid and will spin both sides together

when you do press the keybind, both sides spin seperately
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 11:22:50 I made a new disc PVP vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 11:23:07 its my version 3, unlike the v2 and v1, it flys on its own instead of using hovers
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 11:23:22 issue? its much bigger, and so it doesnt look like a square in build mode, it looks like a swastica
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 11:23:33 each side has 4 servos that rotate 18 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:05:02 woo, my most recent car frame has been designed, this time with a differential gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:22:32 very
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:22:41 and that is after around an hour of trying to compact it
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:22:56 I came up with 2 designs
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:23:00 both incredibly small
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:23:10 well, for plane crazy standards
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:24 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:29 I got them out nowhere
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:35 I remember never having them
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:39 coming back after like, a year
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:40 and then
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:42 boop
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 02:35:45 there we go
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 08:54:17 im really starting to hate PVP players
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 08:54:29 I want to make an original build using cutters
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 08:54:40 but god forbid I kill anyone because then its a shredder and im a loser
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 08:54:43 its pissing me off
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 08:56:11 Acording to the average PVP user, there are 3 types of people
- idiots who are better then me
- people who use guns
- idiots who dont use guns
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 12:01:01 there is only 1 person who isnt an idiot, and its the most hot garbage PVP player
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 02:15:03 I didnt say me, I said according to the average pvp player
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:47:02 this car gets even harder to drive every time I add shit to it
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:47:26 Front wheel drive, Rear wheel drive, All wheel drive
2 Gear Transmission
Realistic Suspension
Front and Rear Differential Gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:47:57 all powered by one engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:48:12 AKA 4 motors in sync for 40k torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:50:18 im not sure what else to add besides a reverse gearbox
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:51:11 Ill try, but reverse the smallest reverse gerabox I can make kills torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:51:26 Im using motors because nothing else is strong enough
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:51:36 Unless a litterally piston engine is faster
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:51:43 would make sense
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:51:55 turning 2 things of linear motion into rotational motion
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:52:29 killed torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:52:43 more gears = more slippage
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:53:02 also, much taller
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:53:18 Ill add a reverse gearbox and a 3 gear transmission
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 11:53:27 but at that point I dont think I can do anything but improve the engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 12:34:24 all the time
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:53:03 that car I posted in chat is getting out of hand
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:53:16 the gears hate working with each other
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 15:54:19 everyone once in awhile it goes "Yeah uhh, I dont really like this plane of reality", seperates into 100 different parts, expands in random directions, and crashes my game, all in the span of around 5 frames

plane-crazy 2023-01-22 22:48:15 funny 90* joint

4 springs and 4 hinges
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 23:56:30 cv joint?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:16:14 painful way to make an ultra compact 90* joint
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:16:21 its going to be even more hell setting it up to the differential gearbox
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:17:01 yee
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:24:55 damn the joint doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:25:03 it has the chance of flipping direction
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:55:37 can anyone help me make a super small 90* gear joint?
the 2 I have run into 2 huge issues
A has extreme torque loss
B has risk of spinning wrong way
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 22:59:03 this is my current setup
They need to be fabric to have grip

But, it loses speed and torque because it also acts as a brake
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 13:54:59 I somehow manage to fight with more idiots in plane crazy than I do any other player in any PVP game
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 15:49:16 fastest most high-torque way to spin this?

Current, its being spun by 1 motor with 10000 torque, which runs in series with 2 motors with 10000 torque in parallel, which runs in series with 4 motors with 10000 torque in parallel
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 16:04:04 really? crazy, ill do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 16:07:59 it performed worse
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 16:11:38 I have another idea
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 16:11:51 All motors run in series, but the motors are heavier the lower they are
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 18:56:49 Now with:
- Central motor engine (Only one motor powers entire car)
- Clutch (Just a single motor locked engine with 0 torque, 0 torque if key pressed, infinite if released)
- 2 Gear constant mesh transmission (1:1, 5:3)
- FWD, RWD, AWD
- Limited slip differential on both front and back wheel
- Suspension
general 2023-06-26 20:00:14 actually what the hell, any time I try and open a game on roblox, if my index is plugged in it will launch SteamVR and launch roblox in vr
there is no way for me to stop this without litterally unplugging my headset
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 21:06:53 roblox is really starting to bug me by forcing launch in VR
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:21:46 Is anyone else recently struggling with double-jetpacks and being unable to remove them?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:22:16 yeah but it feels alot more common recently
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:23:00 Yes, im aware its been a bug, its been a bug for probably a year, i've experience it ever since I got the jetpack

But now it seems its going from rarely every 1-25 launches, its happening like, every other launch
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:24:43 ...
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:25:02 I blurred out every name but my own
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 21:51:05 
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 21:51:14 i built a lego tower on someones base
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:19:49 i really hope PC2 contains any form of roads, and a better rail system
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:28:05 the game itself or the components?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:28:30 the game by default for me could probably run like, 500 FPS despite being capped at 60

But yeah, alot of massive detailed builds tend to drop the local player to nothing
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:28:51 good thing for others it only really lags the server, not you
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:29:32 im using a GTX 1660 Super
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 09:08:55 
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 10:40:56 this is a 3x3x3 conveyor engine
it can reach speeds between 0 and 15000 without breaking

this thing can move anything
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 10:43:26 an issue it seems to run into is the block inside falling out at high speeds, I may have to come up with a slightly bigger design for much more consistent movement
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 11:38:19 we love cargo drone and lego
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 23:39:46 yay, roblox actually fixed the VR bug
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 23:39:50 took long enough
plane-crazy 2023-06-29 23:51:31 Any ideas on how to give these wheels more traction? they slip alot on this hill
