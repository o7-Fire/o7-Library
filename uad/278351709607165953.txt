plane-crazy 2018-11-04 04:33:32 Is it possible for other users to operate your creation with one of the seats?

bug-reports 2018-11-06 05:22:10 Placement is getting annoying with this everytime I load in.
bug-reports 2018-11-06 05:47:59 Yeah, when loading in a larger plane, it began to become wobbly when in flight and would literally bounce on the ground when stationary.

creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:03:04 Yeah, it's durablity is extremely low, but it sometimes makes up for it with manuerving.

plane-crazy 2018-11-12 07:47:05 From earlier*
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 07:09:04 Heh, try and have the towers on both side fold down to allow for larger winged mechanisms to land on it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 07:09:40 Or for another project like it, try it out.
bug-reports 2018-11-16 04:37:24 Seems like whenever I load a creation with an anchor block and enable it, a part of it will be bugged and still controllable.

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:40:30 it's on the Roblox's half though, not the game.

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:42:36 Though I miss that triggering red bar across the screen.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:44:09 Yeah, apparently Roblox is already underway with fixing it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 02:32:15 Welp, anyone still getting these?

plane-crazy 2018-11-30 00:18:42 Kinda found out that you can screw with other peoples properties on their creations. o.e
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 00:19:05 And telling this d00d to make better things than the first thing they think of ;-;
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 00:20:03 Yeah, but he's saying it's a fidget spinner. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
bug-reports 2018-11-30 00:32:49 You may be able to edit other peoples properties on their mech, but not sure entirely.
bug-reports 2018-11-30 00:33:49 Wondering if it's just a client side thing
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:21:50 I ended up getting bored and making a giant 4 prong fidget spinner xD

bug-reports 2018-12-15 00:48:19 LCornerWedges 1x3 aren't welding.
bug-reports 2018-12-15 00:50:53 They only seem to weld to the creation when a block is touching at the back & top.
bug-reports 2018-12-15 04:59:19 Do you have an anchor block somewhere on your creation? <@!336538005676228610>
bug-reports 2018-12-15 04:59:49 Cause if ya' do, may be it just anchoring the entire device to ground as you spawn it in.
help 2018-12-16 22:36:13 How do people make those helicopters? I can't seem to get the craft to take off. The one I'm using for now is a test subject

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 05:50:04 Welp aight, but I'd assume a spot for it is <#504436696021204992> ?
general 2018-12-18 06:04:33 Kinda realized the video should've been in here as it isn't really a creation but still regarding the game. Last time for the night,

general 2020-05-17 09:21:34 Yeah
general 2020-05-17 09:21:40 I decided to go all Corsair lmao

general 2020-05-17 09:33:37 hMM.
general 2020-05-17 09:33:50 I guess the pricing scheme I had was relatively close
general 2020-05-17 09:33:58 The 1TB of this is like 299
general 2020-05-17 09:34:07 But it's like the best SSD out there
general 2020-05-17 09:34:32 hEh
general 2020-05-17 09:34:45 I've almost used up half of my HDD xd
general 2020-05-17 09:35:35 But yeah, SSD prices could go a lot lower too
general 2020-05-17 09:35:47 It's all about the big name brands and what have to offer on that part.
general 2020-05-17 09:36:04 Pricing everywhere on Amazon is wack rn
general 2020-05-17 09:36:20 It's like an Oculus Rift S is selling for $749 **used**
general 2020-05-17 09:37:04 > wtf why does oculus quest is 500 used
3rd Party Sellers
general 2020-05-17 09:37:10 Oculus is out of stock everywhere rn
general 2020-05-17 09:37:28 They've been like that since December pretty sure
general 2020-05-17 09:38:11 > how old are you when you finished your pc
But yeah, I finished the PC either in early March or April.
general 2020-05-17 09:38:23 I think the most recent photo was in April tho
general 2020-05-17 09:39:03 bRuh I've been tryna get the Rift S since February lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:39:17 I'm just waiting on that notification of 'in stock' xd
general 2020-05-17 09:39:36 heheh
general 2020-05-17 09:40:02 I've been wanting to play on the VR 'i got' since August tbh lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:40:21 I haven't touched a VR headset since then and it wasn't even mine
general 2020-05-17 09:40:41 My older brother bought one in the past, but my **old** PC was able to handle it better than his lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:41:00 Yeah
general 2020-05-17 09:41:16 I could play VR and record in 1080p60 if I wanted to
general 2020-05-17 09:42:01 oof
general 2020-05-17 09:42:25 I've been getting excited over the new AMD stuff coming out. <a:PoggersHype:563551682106097665>

general 2020-05-17 09:43:25 > you are good at beat saber
I'm pretty decent. If you click on my profile, there is a YT link to some of the old Beat Saber clips I played from a while back
general 2020-05-17 09:43:33 kek
general 2020-05-17 09:43:51 I have like two new ones I did earlier tonight, just need to open the editing software and do some cuts
general 2020-05-17 09:44:22 Although I still needed to do one more song as my most recent 'playthrough' was a fail of a newer level I need to rebeat
general 2020-05-17 09:44:31 I beat the level off camera and I was pissed lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:45:27 It's definitely nice, but everything inside is a **s n u g g** fit.
general 2020-05-17 09:45:41 It's very compact, and yeah
general 2020-05-17 09:46:06 Yeah, I still got the stock cooler that came with the CPU on my shelf rn lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:46:17 I mean, *when i'm not recording*
general 2020-05-17 09:46:46 When I'm recording Scrap Mechanic at the higher settings I have set up in my recording software, I dip down to the high 30fps lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:47:15 But it's still watchable, I just much rather turn down the video bitrate to raise the FPS.
general 2020-05-17 09:47:39 Yeah
general 2020-05-17 09:47:53 The case comes w/ two SSD mounting brackets on the backside too
general 2020-05-17 09:48:26 It has one DP and HDMI
general 2020-05-17 09:48:42 But it is much more recommended to run display tuff off the GPU lel
general 2020-05-17 09:48:44 
general 2020-05-17 09:48:53 *also the case comes in black as well
general 2020-05-17 09:49:00 *which i believe is cheaper lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:49:16 3 DP & one HDMI
general 2020-05-17 09:49:32 Ye
general 2020-05-17 09:49:42 Only wish the LED on the GPU was brighter though lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:49:58 The LED on it is quite dim when light is shined onto it ngl
general 2020-05-17 09:51:09 I also believe there is another variation of the case too
general 2020-05-17 09:51:19 Although it's more of an aesthetic thing
general 2020-05-17 09:51:39 
general 2020-05-17 09:51:45 oh yeah
general 2020-05-17 09:52:00 The table I have everything sitting one is probably old as me lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:52:55 Not really nah
general 2020-05-17 09:53:04 ye
general 2020-05-17 09:53:09 6 tho xd
general 2020-05-17 09:53:15 3 intake and then 3 exhaust
general 2020-05-17 09:53:42 If I were to ram the fans up to 100% in the bios
general 2020-05-17 09:53:50 They are a literal jet engine
general 2020-05-17 09:54:01 I believe they spin up to 2200rpm each
general 2020-05-17 09:54:29 But normally when playing on the PC w/ a pair of headphones and some music, wouldn't hear it lel
general 2020-05-17 09:54:47 kek, I believe I seen a video on that too before w/ someone doing that
general 2020-05-17 09:55:31 Well, when out of the box and put together, the fans are gonna be a tad loud on the first side,
general 2020-05-17 09:55:55 but with going into the bios you can set a fan curve to quiet them down a fair amount
general 2020-05-17 09:56:21 tldr; When configured right; wouldn't hear anything lmao
general 2020-05-17 09:56:54 <a:BloSkeletonBoogie:684925672480964608>

general 2020-05-17 09:57:16 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-05-17 09:57:41 Well it definitely is cheaper if you go that route
general 2020-05-17 09:57:56 On top of that, if you're just gonna use the stock cooler
general 2020-05-17 09:58:27 You could get a more taller styled of ram being the RAM was custom picked for the radiator in mind
general 2020-05-17 09:58:52 Like w/ the radiator the clearance from the mb to the radiator was like 42mm pretty sure
general 2020-05-17 09:59:19 So I stuck with 32/34mm RAM to be safe
general 2020-05-17 10:00:15 kek, I'll make sure to take some more pictures if you would like them at any point too to get a better feel on its perspective
general 2020-05-17 10:00:29 Only thing I might not show is the backend cable management lmao
general 2020-05-17 10:00:41 *that is a rats nest atm* <a:lmao:632321248109527040>

general 2020-05-17 10:05:49 oH, I've been looking monitors lately and been trying to decide that lel
general 2020-05-17 10:06:10 The monitor I've seen that was doing pretty good was a Sceptre pretty sure
general 2020-05-17 10:06:18 I'll fetch a link
general 2020-05-17 10:07:18 Yeah here it is; One of my friends is running a triple monitor setup with these.

general 2020-06-17 02:16:58 YuP
general 2020-06-17 02:18:28 these are all the places currently DDoS'ing the U.S. and Brazil.
general 2020-06-17 02:18:35 Y'all read up on the news rofl
general 2020-06-17 02:19:04 Apparently it's because of a trade deal or somethin'
general 2020-06-17 02:19:13 It's not one person rofl
general 2020-06-17 02:19:31 It's millions of people mad at a electronic ban that happened in Brazil
general 2020-06-17 02:19:57 It's not just roblox rofl
general 2020-06-17 02:21:08 *this is just **one** of those lines on that digital map rofl*

general 2020-06-17 02:22:43 no it's not
general 2020-06-17 02:22:47 Read the news
general 2020-06-17 02:23:51 The reason why there is even a DDoS going on right now is because of a trade deal between the U.S. and Brazil over 5G cell towers.
general 2020-06-17 02:24:40 I don't remember the exact company that started it, but the deal wouldn't be carried through unless all Chinese Huawei devices were basically banned in Brazil.
general 2020-06-17 02:24:47 Thus making people **pissed.**

general 2020-06-17 02:28:22 But the DDoS is what happened **after** the ban
general 2020-06-17 02:29:02 Yeah, Huawei is a phone company yess
general 2020-06-17 02:29:08 or simply tech business

the-dump 2020-06-30 19:16:56 I love this one nonetheless
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:19:09 Might as well make modlogs visible to users then for a fair right at grabbing evidence when users decide to delete. <:wait:652565313337950230>
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:20:23 Ight, it's quite useless then trying to get "evidence" on your end of it all when you all you have nothing but witnesses and the logs between ya'.
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:20:56 Although I do understand why it is that way though.
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:21:47 <:ElonHMM:715614569430515783>
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:21:55 Quite the question you see
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:22:48 Ight that is backwards ngl
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:23:00 <:ElonWoke:589674854798589962>
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:23:14 **What is <:ElonWoke:589674854798589962> suggesting then?**
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:23:27 By y'alls moderation standard then
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:24:00 Cause if it's going to be enforced, might as well keep it fluent throughout the whole server instead of ignoring portions
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:24:41 Yeah, but by moderation standards, that could be suggestive as 'drug usage'
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:24:56 So... <:BIGLOL:601468049245208577>
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:25:39 That is fair point, but just things like that just make it inconsistent
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:25:57 And can sway an argument on direction based on that
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:26:29 As "why is that okay but then not that?" Type of stuff
the-dump 2020-06-30 19:26:40 Just a thought

general 2020-07-07 06:28:21 Is all the audio settings for roblox and the game enabled? <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-07-07 06:29:00 Make sure and check the audio id is correct, ensure Windows audio is enabled or turned on too
general 2020-07-07 06:29:35 It's dependent on their settings then based on that I suppose.
general 2020-07-07 06:30:44 That's common sense to post in the right channels to begin with
general 2020-07-07 06:30:58 That's the very reason why channels are named that way
general 2020-07-07 06:31:18 They're all under a general purpose

general 2020-07-19 22:55:10 nahnah, 854p rofl
general 2020-07-19 22:55:49 Like is it rerouting to that site, or is it just the internet dying out whilst searching?
general 2020-07-19 22:56:09 bruh momento
general 2020-07-19 22:56:35 They moved the plane-crazy chat above general for a reason ü§£
general 2020-07-19 22:57:40 ngl though, they should either revamp the built-in recorder or just scrap it tbh rofl
general 2020-07-19 22:58:27 Like, a clip I have on my PC hits **much** higher spec counts
general 2020-07-19 22:58:52 They do though, that's from Streamlabs recording at 1080p60
general 2020-07-19 22:59:38 The main reason why videos will look good will be based is on the data / bit rate
general 2020-07-19 22:59:54 The higher that is, the less blocky / pixelated the video is

general 2020-09-09 23:02:04 I used to throw my iPhone around the room, keep in mind it was an iPhone 6, that crap was built like a nokia compared to the newer crap I've seen lmao
general 2020-09-09 23:02:48 Yeah, I swapped to a Samsung s10e last year or so now, I enjoy it better now
general 2020-09-09 23:03:14 And yeah I flat out dropped a 2 lb rock on the screen of the iphone 6, just a minor scratch <a:lmao:632321248109527040>
general 2020-09-09 23:04:13 I enjoy the s10 a lot more compared to the iPhone 6, every time I took it with during the winter on the way to school, it had like a 59% max battery capacity.
