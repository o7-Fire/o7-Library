The Tale of TestName (1013420538099683429)
general 2022-12-26 03:21:57 Sup
general 2022-12-26 03:22:24 There is nothing wrong with shredders.
general 2022-12-26 03:22:30 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:37:50 Hmmm
contest-chat 2022-12-26 03:39:22 Dude let's contest something
contest-chat 2022-12-26 03:39:39 Nvm it's not that contest
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:44:30 Guys stop hating on shredders.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:44:51 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:44:57 Shredders aren't even that OP
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:45:40 it's about shredders. For some reason people rlly hate these guys and I heard that it effected PC2 and that cutters will be nerfed! These people either hate it because it's no skill in which case there are many other no skill builds which they don't hate making them inconsistent or they hate it because it's too OP in which case they gotta hate like 3 other build categories or they are inconsistent because spaceships, VTOLS, namnam design fighter jets are ALL more OP than shredders and NOONE complains. Especially when namnam jet TNT a shotgun-railguns and fireworks are chucked onto them making them even more OP. If you wanna see what I'm talking about when I say spaceships are OP go to a yt channel called "TM_XT" and see the spaceships he shows in his stream, if you wanna see namnam jets go look at namnams channel and see his jet tutorials and guides. He even shows you how to make an OP tnt cannon for your jet/vtol/flying machine or whatever and to top off and bust the myth of shredders being too op there are many proven ways on yt shown of how to destroy shredder ez. Pls change that one number in the code which determines the damage done by the future saw block and make it as good as a cutter. I know it may be hard work to re-add the cutter but changing the number is easy.      

Debunking another thing which annoying shredder haters say to defend the myth that using a shredder is cheating: why does everyone hate shredders if it's really not that bad? The answer is because, memes and myths can be spread without them being correct just as there are many people who think the earth is flat when it's not.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:46:09 You still can't debunk what I posted lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:46:16 Yes, it's copy paste
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:47:51 First of all, namnam jet tutorials and guides are rlly easy to make as if they are designed for beginners I managed to make one rlly quick
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:48:33 Second of all, shredders help newbies because pros don't need them.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:48:43 But it gives newbies a step up
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:49:04 Jets are also almsot everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:49:06 Almost
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:49:21 Especially the easy and no skill namnam jets and gjsolo 64 jets.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:49:49 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:50:21 But it's inconsistent to hate on shredders and not hate on these no skill jets and no skill spaceships
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:50:25 No I don't dislike them.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:50:59 Yes, spaceships are also no skill. You just pop a 0-gravity glitch on it and stick a conveyor engine on with a few propellers.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:51:52 By the way, shredders are similar in control system to namnam jets.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:52:05 Not namnam jets lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:52:11 Especially if you follow a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:52:24 No you don't
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:52:51 Namnam jets have two control systems: 1: WASD controls 2: stick your mouse on the target and shoot.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:53:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:53:15 I watched a namnam guide
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:53:21 And made a whole army of namnam jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:53:45 They all just go where I stick my finger
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:53:51 Cuz that's what some namnam jets do
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:54:07 Spaceships could also be modified to have controls similar to namnam jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:54:15 Making them extra OP
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:54:47 Ok, wanna hate on another build catagory?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:54:52 Not as common as shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:06 I might get red_dragon to release a tutorial on how to make em soon
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:14 To make em more common
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:22 They are noob spaceships
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:28 Very ez to make
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:33 They have 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:41 And can go at speed of above 10k
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:51 Can have similar controls to namnam jets too.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:55:59 Wanna hate on 3 build categories total?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:56:27 Not really
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:56:34 Because it doesn't only go at 10k
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:56:36 You can choose
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:56:41 Weather to do a sudden dodge
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:56:46 Or go into turning mode.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:57:51 So yeah, you're going to need to hate on a lot of things if you hate shredders because they are OP and no skill.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:58:06 Or you are inconsistent.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:58:51 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:58:53 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:58:57 I encountered that
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:59:03 It's a spaceship mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:59:37 Also, I wouldn't count that as something which is to complain about though
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:59:41 Because void tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 03:59:47 Is VERY UNCOMMON
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:05 I know 2 players which have it
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:18 One has a shredder called "rahaless" or something like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:31 But again "rahaless" is an exception
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:34 Nah it's not
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:40 Counter them with a namnam jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:46 Of a spaceship
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:00:55 I countered them many time with a VTOL
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:00 It was pretty effective
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:10 I just dogfight them
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:26 Because one of the biggest weaknesses of the shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:30 Is a dogfight
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:38 It can't aim at a high speed dogfight
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:46 Unless it has core tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:01:50 I mean void tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:06 No, void tech goes in the void
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:13 Core tech is for supermanueverability
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:25 Also, just use a vtol if you hate shredder.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:28 So much
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:38 That you are inconsistent enough to use a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:02:42 Which is more OP
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:01 By the way, namnam shows you how to stick tnt shotgun on a jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:06 Making it extra OP
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:18 Yes, they are highly maneuverable
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:22 But their limit
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:35 Is how fast someone can tilt their screen
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:38 Or mouse
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:03:55 Vtol can do very tight spins on one point
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:04:17 And it doesn't even take as much as to move your finger onto the screen or one centimeter.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:05:05 Vtols can do many types of confusing moves due to the type of VTOL I'm talking about being the one that resembles the shape of a futuristic flying car
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:05:27 Allowing it to do a back flip to the side
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:05:36 From an upside down position
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:05:40 And stuff like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:06:02 Along with the ability to do stuff from reverse at slow speeds.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:06:26 I used a VTOL and beat like 3 of the spaceships shown in the TM_XT channel
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:06:32 Which use core tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:06:38 And sometimes void tech
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:07:31 So vtols are pretty OP so they are another thing to hate before shredders.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:09:34 Nicee
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:09:56 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:10:10 Yes, because their aim sucks.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:10:15 In dogfights
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:10:21 Yup
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:10:38 That's why people shouldn't complain about shredders lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:11:01 Unless they encounter one of the best shredders in plane crazy for example: rahaless.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:11:09 Which is not a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:11:13 It is a custom shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:11:28 Made by a group of players who design rlly good ones.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:11:52 You meant to say not annoying?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:12:40 Well, if you are going to talk about builds that aren't that OP but are annoying
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:12:57 Lol omni isn't even close to a high speed helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:13:03 Have you even tried lol?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:13:11 I have both an omni and a high speed VTOL
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:13:23 Which is a fancy drone-like heli with multiple props
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:13:35 And the VTOL usually beats the omni
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:14:48 Also, a top notch jet isn't needed to beat a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:05 You need a 15 minute tutorial namnam trash thing lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:18 Or a 10 minute spaceship
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:27 He posted a guide
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:34 In which through he makes a good jet
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:38 And shows how to build it
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:15:43 So you can just copy lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:16:25 Yeah, what makes it bad to follow it like a tut? How does it ruin pvp more than the guy who doesn't??
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:16:50 In fact, the guy who doesn't is usually gonna be better
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:16:56 Thus ruining pvp more
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:17:34 Anyways, what's bad about being gud lol?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:17:54 Nah
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:18:49 Dude that comment was a continuation of my other comment
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:18:56 Not a response
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:19:11 The other comment was actual response
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:19:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:19:30 It is.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:19:55 Why do jets need to be very versatile?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:20:04 And what is inaccurate?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:20:42 Wdym "actual ailerons"?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:21:40 Yeah, what's wrong with custom control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:21:50 Isn't that what the F35 uses and other jets?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:21:57 And why does realism matter anyways?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:22:35 Dude what custom control surfaces are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:22:45 Send me a photo
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:23:31 Namnam jets work with intakes and landing gears anyways lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:23:45 You just stick them on and then stick on the namnam design.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:23:58 What could be so bad about motor 2s + wing panels?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:24:59 Oh, those.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:11 Why not use engines for pitch and yaw?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:37 Yes.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 04:25:44 They are good enough
general 2022-12-30 06:27:09 #e

plane-crazy 2023-01-06 08:50:11 That's what glitched mouse is
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 08:50:18 It does barrel rolls and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 08:50:35 It's a very OP glitch
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 08:50:46 You can see gjsolo64's channel for how.

general 2023-03-17 13:50:04 Yeah true
general 2023-03-17 13:50:29 This reply is to the racist comment.
general 2023-03-17 13:51:37 You must hate yourself bro, surprised you haven't self destructed yet.
general 2023-03-17 13:52:23 He is narcissistic then.
general 2023-03-17 13:52:41 Dude this is general channel
general 2023-03-17 13:52:48 Go to the plane
general 2023-03-17 13:52:51 Crazy channel
general 2023-03-17 13:52:58 True
general 2023-03-17 13:53:08 We all think we are best at something
general 2023-03-17 13:53:48 The narcissistic part is when someone believes that they deserve to be famous and rule everyone or a lot of people and get a lot of power.
general 2023-03-17 13:54:31 Narcissism is when someone has a huge ego
general 2023-03-17 13:54:58 Yeah, and guess what that is, EGOOOO

general 2023-03-17 15:33:38 Extended is bad grammar plus it's "why are you so into grammar" not "why you so into grammar" learn grammar.
general 2023-07-07 16:29:34 Plane crazy is trash game
general 2023-07-07 16:30:12 I don't want him to get kicked
general 2023-07-07 16:30:19 I agree that democracy is absolute trash
general 2023-07-07 16:30:21 Like heck
general 2023-07-07 16:31:02 Because imagine letting all those idiots on the street and people who don't even believe in truth and conspiracy theorists vote....
general 2023-07-07 16:31:16 This is why democracy is the biggest trash
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:51 Don't care
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:47:57 This server is trash
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:01 Big trash
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:16 I didn't say the ppl were trash
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:48:21 But a lot of the ppl are
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:49:00 Anyways, exploit on a device u don't care about while using a vpn because now roblox ip and hardware bans exploiters.
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:30 And what will happen if you get banned?
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:52:34 ?
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:53:19 Ye, you just get ur one account or device or ip kicked lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:53:23 Nothing very bad
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:53:24 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:24 It does justify some kinds
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:34 Not all exploiting harms ppl
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:54:50 Exploiting which doesn't
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:03 No
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:35 I am advocating for exploits like free cam
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:43 Because bans can be circumvented
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:53 And freecam harms no one
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:55:59 Then what's wrong
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:57:50 I wouldn't advocate injector because that's illegal
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:58:59 But shaders are very much like exploits because like many exploits they take advantage of things in the computer which you can edit to make your game different from everyone else's
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 19:59:16 The shader changes what the computer screen displays
