help 2020-06-07 02:25:46 So, I made a plane thing with a cargo ramp, and a friend made a car to be transported inside the plane thing. So he gets the car inside, and I start flying. Immediately, the car just exits the plane and falls to the ground. The cargo ramp is closed and the car is surrounded by walls, so it just clipped through my creation. Is there a way to keep the car inside the plane?
