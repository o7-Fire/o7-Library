plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:19:02 How nice are people here from the scale of 1-10..
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:20:38 Well, I came here for help, since I spent the whole night frustrating myself with an engineering game
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:20:44 You know, the usual..
creations-chat 2018-12-28 06:22:11 Is this where I can find help regarding mechanical engineering..
creations-chat 2018-12-28 06:22:24 actually I'll just read the rules
help 2018-12-28 06:22:42 halp
help 2018-12-28 06:23:21 Since yesterday I've been trying to make a biplane thats more maneuverable
help 2018-12-28 06:23:30 This is my 3rd attempt on making a biplane
help 2018-12-28 06:23:35 http://prntscr.com/m0gvrz
help 2018-12-28 06:23:54 It seems the wings lift up the elevation a lot, or its either the weight is too heavy
help 2018-12-28 06:24:06 But they are both aligned
help 2018-12-28 06:25:10 Its hidden by the front wings
help 2018-12-28 06:25:13 their there
help 2018-12-28 06:25:30 I limited myself with the length of the biplane, to hopefully be able to make sharp turns
help 2018-12-28 06:26:11 Enlighten me by how planes make sharp turns
help 2018-12-28 06:27:25 Meaning?
help 2018-12-28 06:28:19 wait so the main wings need to be farther from the stabalizers?
help 2018-12-28 06:28:59 Can they be closer to the engine, while the body is extended further from the back?
help 2018-12-28 06:29:45 What for?
help 2018-12-28 06:30:19 ok
help 2018-12-28 06:30:50 Another question, can the plane turn sharply if I add more control surfaces?
help 2018-12-28 06:32:21 What about lowwing monoplanes?
help 2018-12-28 06:32:29 the planes commonly used during wwii
help 2018-12-28 06:32:45 Yea, and the hurricane and P-41
help 2018-12-28 06:33:01 Or was that p-40..
help 2018-12-28 06:33:02 idk
help 2018-12-28 06:36:21 I like this server ;D
help 2018-12-28 06:39:10 dam
help 2018-12-28 06:42:38 Now I have less motivation to complete my biplane
help 2018-12-28 06:44:26 Can I put more ballast blocks on my plane just to pull up the weight?
help 2018-12-28 06:44:27 /hopefully..
help 2018-12-28 06:52:04 yea
help 2018-12-28 07:00:26 Nvm
help 2019-01-05 14:27:50 http://prntscr.com/m3dk7n
help 2019-01-05 14:27:57 I need help with this stupid tank's steering
help 2019-01-05 14:28:03 It needs to make sharp turns
help 2019-01-05 17:27:27 oh
help 2019-01-05 17:27:33 I learned a lot now, wow
help 2019-01-06 01:54:13 I've failed to make one
help 2019-01-06 01:54:25 Several times
help 2019-01-06 01:55:23 I know..
help 2019-01-06 01:56:19 No need to rub it in..
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 13:37:07 Theres actually a P-41..
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 13:37:10 Called the Warhawk
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 11:06:57 Oh, the tank from one of the thumbnails
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 11:08:13 Somethings odd about the picture tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 11:11:23 <@458451488335986688> sorry for the mention, but who's the owner of that space?
help 2019-01-13 08:13:30 In Suspensions, whats Damping, Sitffness, and Free length?
help 2019-01-13 08:13:37 Please someone explain thoroughly to me
help 2019-01-13 12:47:47 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:25:36 Has anyone here built the Tiger I before?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:27:01 I'd like to look for some inspiration
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:35:36 What?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:37:32 I'm talking about the Panzer VI Tiger I tank..
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:38:06 I should've been more specific then
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:38:27 Do you have a picture of your tank?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:39:07 The haul is a lot harder than I expected
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:41:24 It has a sloping body which is challenging.
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:48:14 Has anyone tried creating caterpillar/tank threads which work well and have the ability to steer the vehicle?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 07:48:22 I've seen the rope thing, but that doesn't seem to work well
help 2019-01-14 08:06:47 For my suspensions, damping and stiffness are maxed 100, but they still seem to bounce a lot
general 2019-01-16 13:10:05 Anyone likes talking about tanks?
general 2019-01-16 13:10:08 Or history?
general 2019-01-16 13:13:20 I gave up on building planes in the game, so I started making WWII tanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:45:13 I'm using light theme now
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:45:25 Thank you, for making a political difference
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:49:31 The list of servers refuses to use light theme
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:49:38 Also the channel list
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:23:53 Its nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:26:05 I think I'm in some existential crisis whenever I'm on that game..
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:26:40 I never seem to build anything that works nor pleases me
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:27:15 Anything that works.
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:27:41 For what
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:27:59 No
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:28:04 I did once
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:28:49 So apparently its some god-giving answer to all my problems?..
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:29:14 Duley noted
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:29:22 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:30:20 One day, I'll stop contemplating with myself over a game.
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:35:52 Least you were proud of them when they were  successful right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:51:37 Your sub looks cool  <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:52:48 Hell yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:52:55 Arma3 is worth getting
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:53:25 Agreed
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:53:38 Its a vas open-world game
plane-crazy 2019-01-20 14:53:57 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 06:59:59 Hey
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 07:00:13 You don't happen to see anything strange on Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 07:00:30 Could you tell me?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 07:00:58 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 07:01:12 http://prntscr.com/mpbnlu
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 07:01:16 Whats this?..
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 14:09:22 Anyone here?
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 14:09:29 I'd like to report an inappropriate creation in Plane Crazy
help 2020-09-07 05:58:51 Hey, I need ideas, tips, or advice for the  Nakajima KI-84
help 2020-09-07 05:59:10 
help 2020-09-07 05:59:50 Someone suggested that I should use "large control surfaces". So I'm thinking I need to build manual(?) control surfaces from scratch, but I'm not familiar with other control surfaces
help 2020-09-07 05:59:56 Also, are the wings too large?
help 2020-09-07 06:00:38 I'm looking for help, and not criticism
general 2020-09-07 06:02:24 Out of a 100 players, and having atleast a third of it, active, I was not expecting a one-on-one conversation.
general 2020-09-07 06:03:07 You ride a bike to the groceries, Battle?
general 2020-09-07 06:03:42 You got a job, Battle?
general 2020-09-07 06:03:57 What occupation, if I may ask
general 2020-09-07 06:04:16 Oh, I see
general 2020-09-07 06:04:31 I'm guessing you have a bike as your transport?
general 2020-09-07 06:05:09 Why are you pushing for a bike, Leon
general 2020-09-07 06:05:52 Whatever transport you have, that's fine
general 2020-09-07 06:05:55 As long as you're comfortable with it
creations-chat 2020-09-07 06:08:28 <@!367986810862698498> You've got an interesting looking UAVTOL there. Is it only armed with MG's?
help 2020-09-07 07:01:23 I have the KI-84 blueprints as reference
help 2020-09-07 07:02:31 I'm having a hard time trying to get the body, accurate
help 2020-09-07 07:02:56 Make them thinner?
help 2020-09-07 07:07:04 Ok
help 2020-09-07 07:08:41 Should I make new control surfaces?
help 2020-09-07 07:29:16 I assume you use w3 school for color codes?
help 2020-09-07 07:36:18 I'll link you to it, I think it'll help your camo
help 2020-09-07 07:41:01 I'll look into it, thanks
help 2020-09-07 07:44:24 Use the folding technique
help 2020-09-09 02:34:07 
help 2020-09-09 02:34:14 I'm trying to make a wing flap for a prop plane, but I've never made one before
help 2020-09-09 02:35:16 No, I just need an idea on how to make a flap
help 2020-09-09 02:35:21 I'm using wing parts
help 2020-09-09 02:38:00 I still need an idea. This flap has to be un-anchored to any other part except the motor
help 2020-09-09 03:08:05 What does it mean when your plane keeps nosing down when in flight?
help 2020-09-09 03:12:00 Should I work on that first, before moving to custom control surfaces?
