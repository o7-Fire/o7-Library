The Tale of glitcheey (168537938211241984)
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:40:55 So uhm
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:41:01 can somebody help me understand something
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:41:04 My suspensions aren't working
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:41:54 It doesn't answer my question
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:42:55 My suspensions aren't working. I have them attached to wheels, but they don't do what they're supposed to. The vehicle just stays stiff
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:42:58 <@!263880614036373504>
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:43:14 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:43:14 I do
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:43:37 
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:44:19 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:44:46 What Sakura said fixed it.
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:44:51 I didn't need to move the suspension.
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:44:58 Thank you Sakura
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:45:27 I know
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:45:29 I already have.
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:51:03 Is there a way to limit how much a motor can rotate?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:51:10 Like a certain degrees
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 09:58:13 What does the Powered setting on motors do?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:36:58 Does the lock function on a motor make it impossible to move, or does it just make it work less like a joint?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:37:09 No what
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:37:31 Ok that's what I need
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:39:21 <@!163143541160148992> Because I did and I didn't notice any difference
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:39:23 So I asked here
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:39:33 What's so wrong about asking questions :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 09:00:13 Can someone help me out?
Whenever I put wheels on my vehicle, it vibrates intensely and any pistons I have on it automatically extend, and I can't retract them
bug-reports 2019-02-13 09:02:16 Whenever I put wheels on my vehicle, it vibrates intensely and any pistons I have on it automatically extend, and I can't retract them
bug-reports 2019-02-13 09:02:31 Doesn't matter what wheels. Landing gears or regular
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 09:05:30 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 09:10:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 09:10:45 I wish the building space was wider
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:50:29 What do ballast blocks do?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:50:50 Ok that's what I thought
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:51:03 But they don't seem to effect the center of mass any more than a regular block
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:51:11 Or at least the indicator
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:52:36 That's really annoying
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:52:52 Im trying to get my lift and mass to overlap and I can't see where the indicator moves :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:54:35 Can someone help me with understanding something?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:55:21 <@!304977711988867072> On something like this, should the lift overlap with the center of mass or should it be somewhere else?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:55:52 No matter where I put the lift it seems it always wants to flip over
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:56:13 Should it be above or below at all?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:56:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:19 Ok well
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:24 At the moment it is behind
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:27 But I still stall
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:30 It pulls up
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:36 On it's own
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:57:42 But the lift is behind
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:17 
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:26 Right is front
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:33 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:59:03 I have no engines providing lift
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:59:05 Only propellers
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:59:19 None pointing forward either
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:00:02 If someone could come to my server and look to see if there's any problems that would be appreciated
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:00:11 I've experimented with this so much but I always get the same problem
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:00:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:01:03 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:01:27 I've tried like this
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:01:28 
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:01:45 Like this
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:02:04 I've tried with and without wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:02:12 Im getting nowhere
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:02:53 I feel like giving up
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:03:34 Yes I want to make something like that
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:03:37 But mine just always flips over
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:03:43 No matter what I try
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:04:40 I guess i'm just gonna give up
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:04:44 I can't figure it out
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:05:33 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:04:45 I saw somebody who put propeller blades on a propeller engine and they spin with it. I can't seem to replicate that though, does anybody know how?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:06:00 <@!224513422161739776> I thought of that too, but their propeller blades spun up slowly like how the engine did, it wasn't instantaneous like it is with the motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:06:38 Multiple motors how???
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:06:42 I don't understand how more would help
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:44:28 Uhhhg, I REALLLY wish you could lock wheels so that they wouldn't rotate left and right
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:46:45 How are anchor blocks going to help?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 11:46:47 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:05:59 <@!99607451300548608> You're a propeller master. Can you help me with something?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:07:54 hhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:11:01 So, I'm trying to get my plane to have enough speed to actually fly with only propellers/propeller blades/motors. I've seen plenty of vehicles that go very fast with only those two things, but I can't seem to get mine to go fast at all
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:11:07 :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:12:12 I don't know what the rope glitch is
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:12:44 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:12:48 Huh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:12:52 Ill try that lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:14:28 Ok sorry mal
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:18:28 Ok that works
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:18:37 I can take off now. But now I have another problem lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:19:16 My plane is constantly leaning to the right, and also doesn't pull up. It's weight is perfectly balanced on both sides, so idk what could possibly be causing it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:20:43 So turning the torque down will fix the lean issue?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:21:14 How do I fix that?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:21:40 So it's impossible to build a single engine plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:21:43 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:21:49 That's gay
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:21:55 Then how
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:22:03 Flame how?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:22:12 I have a single engine plane and it tilts right
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:22:24 everything is perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:22:36 
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:22:41 
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:23:32 They are, everything is set correctly
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:23:38 And even when I'm not touching them it leans
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:24:24 I checked, it's all correct
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:26:26 :c
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:26:34 I don't
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:26:39 And I'm not sure where the fuselage is
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:26:46 I checked the rudder when you asked me to check the ailerons
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:11 But if theres a way to use 1 I'd much MUCH prefer that
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:13 What flame said
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:26 Flame could you join me and try to help me?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:37 That works?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:40 But
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:43 I don't want to use engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:28:44 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:29:12 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:29:13 Cya
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:29:28 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:10 Yeah but
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:26 Wouldn't that only help with the turning? It also dips down
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:36 wait maybe
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:46 It dips down because of the turning
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:53 Let me try
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:32:27 Flame said that he had a single engine that worked
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:32:33 So I will make a single engine that works
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:33:38 Do wing panels work as propellers?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:33:44 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:34:06 I'm not using engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:35:37 Hidden blades in the body don't work
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:35:42 to counteract it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:36:59 Or 4. Wait 8 hours for flame to get back on and see how his works
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:37:04 lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:37:33 Why?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:37:52 <@!224513422161739776> Why not?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:49:51 Ok so <@!224513422161739776> I'm trying to use 2 motors, just to see how well it flies with no issues, but now theres a new problem
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:49:56 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:51:10 <@!224513422161739776> Only one motor spins at a time. I tried doubling one's torque, but that didn't help. I gave it more after that and the back engine froze instead
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:52:00 <@!224513422161739776> https://gyazo.com/66da6705472906044c65334a9b6f0977
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:52:08 Both motors are set correctly
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:52:13 with controls
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:52:32 I did
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:52:37 What is it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:53:38 I tried both ways now
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:53:49 If the back motor has double, the front motor freezes
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:53:56 if the other way around, the back motor freezes
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:54:12 I did
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:54:17 Then the back freezes
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:54:43 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:54:45 Doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:54:57 Neither does back 20 front 10
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:55:14 https://gyazo.com/6db372cd49a6669aa2c2714500603f67
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:55:36 :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:55:58 I'm so unbelievably confused
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:57:43 According to everyone I HAVE to put another motor
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:57:55 Or use engines, but I don't want to use engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:19 I know all that
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:27 But biplanes aren't twin engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:36 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:51 They fly with 1 engine irl
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:05 That's a newer one
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:07 I mean the older ones
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:13 Which is what i'm trying to replicate
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:22 I know they didn't turbo
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:45 <@!351809528209080324>
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:01:40 That's not a movie biplane lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:01:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:02:00 How did they fly with only one engine without tilting?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:02:40 Then how did they counteract it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:10:27 So what i'm understanding from that video is that going in a straight line with one engine like this shouldn't be a problem, it's only when turning that it has any effect
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:10:44 But mine turns regardless
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:10:53 Am I just not going fast enough?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:11:29 Yeah it's stupid
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:12:30 I just watched that video on it, their planes didn't have that problem unless they were turning
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 02:45:25 Im dying lmfaooo

plane-crazy 2019-02-21 02:45:46 im dying
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 02:45:54 Too funny
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 02:46:11 Lmao

help 2019-02-27 00:46:28 Are you in a pvp server?
help 2019-02-27 01:02:00 <@!350241258012278784> Is your impact speed set too high?
help 2019-02-27 01:02:12 Idk then lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:23:14 There needs to be
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 00:23:20 half triangle wedge up blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 01:59:36 Wtf how do you color the propellers inside of jet engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 01:59:41 I just did it now I can't do it again
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 01:59:55 Where? I can't find it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:00:19 Idk where that is located lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:00:27 I've clicked all over this thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:01:03 Yeah, but idk where near the cone
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:02:22 This is stupid, why can't you just click the propellers
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:10:00 So uhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:10:15 What causes a plane to go into a sort of "drift" when trying to realign it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:10:26 Idk if that's understandable or not lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:11:17 What happens is I'll spin it to go into a turn, then when I try to spin it back the other way it fights against me, and the backside kind of pulls around like how a car would go into a drift
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:11:24 It's balanced on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:12:16 How will anchor blocks help?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:12:18 :/
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:12:34 Why would I do that
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:12:46 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:12:55 I guarantee it will
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:05 Have you had this problem that I'm having?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:17 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:18 That's retarded
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:39 I'm just saying that it's not really helpful
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:53 What do you think i'm asking help for? jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:13:57 Quit with the passive agressiveness
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:14:19 <@!279767565444710401> <@!221487880487436288>  i'll send a gif 1 sec
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:14:33 lol flame
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:15:47 I do appreciate the offer of help greatly, but just because I say it's not a great idea doesn't mean I'm attacking you
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:08 Yes, and when I say I don't want to do it you say "just fix your plane then lmao"
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:14 That's passive aggressive for no reason.
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:37 Yes, because you shouldn't have to anchor the entire thing to turn it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:38 It is retarded
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:41 Yes I do

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:16:52 During this whole motion I was pitching left
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:17:16 What is wrong with them? lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:17:58 Oh shit
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:18:05 I pinged you on accident flamesword lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:18:29 <@!221487880487436288> I had it like that before, but then I can't turn at all
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:19:07 Idk what canards are lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:19:23 Ok i'll try that
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:21:22 That helped <@!264769733021270016>
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:21:24 a bit
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:21:41 It helped
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:21:42 a little

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 02:23:33 I have to make the front a bit heavier hold on

plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:07 It is on night
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:10 I don't mean the light  itself
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:14 I mean the block
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:17 doesn't look neon
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:21 like other people's
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:31:48 What do you mean?

plane-crazy 2019-03-03 00:34:09 I can't lol

plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:48:00 How complicated does a creation have to be to get inventor?
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:49:05 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:49:10 I meant the mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:49:38 Idk if anyone else has made this before
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:49:44 It's a speedboat drifting mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:49:49 It's really simple, but i've never seen one before
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:50:45 The boat has a rotating motor that is stopped by two prongs hanging down that get in it's way from turning too much, but when you hold shift the prongs lift a tiny bit, letting the motor turn enough to go into a drifting motion
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:51:12 But not enough that they just spin completely in the opposite direction
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:52:24 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:52:38 
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:53:09 It's the thing I made
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:53:16 It lets my speedboat drift
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 07:53:33 It's simple though and I wonder if it qualifies for inventor rank, assuming I came up with it

plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:23:49 Im just making it lift now
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:24:45 Jetski
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:24:57 Waverace 64
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:25:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:26:46 Jeez
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:26:52 This is going to take so many propeller engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:27:21 how 2 hack in snowblower engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:27:23 jk
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:27:43 A lot
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:27:47 engines are diminishing returns
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:27:59 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:30:15 It does look easy
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:30:28 I've made shapes like that before
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:30:47 Tf is that image
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:30:58 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:31:00 OH
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:31:08 What LOL
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:31:12 <:whymydolphinnotworking:552912733008429081>
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:31:26 thats some funny stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:57:22 aaaAAAA
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:57:26 I can't get this thing to hover
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:26:20 So uhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:26:43 If you attach helium blocks to something, does the entire thing lose weight or does the helium pull on it wherever it's attached?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:03 Ok that's my issue then
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:11 I've been trying to get this thing to work for ages
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:18 Ok thank you
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:31 https://gyazo.com/0b1a3e1d9020302930f790217dd66c63
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:33 This thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:27:49 It is balanced out
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:28:19 When it lifts up the top flops down over the side because it's topheavy, and because the entire thing is weightless instead of just the balloons
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:28:40 But now that I know rope works differently it should help
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:28:47 Yeah hold on
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:28:54 It will be laggy sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:29:00 3.5k blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:29:02 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:29:06 I get that now
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:30:10 oof I couldn't get the whole thing because it went so slow
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:30:17 but you can see what it's doing
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:30:18 https://gyazo.com/e3ae8ca06fc9008e576b823fffd110bd
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:30:49 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:30:54 But it should be balanced in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:31:11 It has engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:31:16 that's what pushes it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:31:44 I would have to constantly have those active to balance it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:31:56 I want to be able to walk around on this thing as it hovers
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:32:09 It has ballast on the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:32:17 at least a thousand blocks worth of density
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:32:42 I'm pretty sure rope will fix my issue
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:32:44 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:33:02 If it doesn't i'll let you know
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:33:15 I'm gonna tighten the rope 100%
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:34:34 Yes but since it changes how the balloons effect the vehicle, it might help
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:00 <@!216371990959882241> The ropes did fix the issue
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:03 But now theres a new issue
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:08 https://gyazo.com/ff7aa99c44a5825559943fd0b17d87dc
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:27 1 on each balloon
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:51 It's not the ropes that cause the issue
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:38:55 It's the weight distribution
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:00 They are motorized?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:03 Wym
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:10 Im bad at mechanics lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:17 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:27 Idk what a swash plate is
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:39:41 Im a newbie when it comes to mechanical stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:40:06 Guys it's not the propellers lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:40:18 It's the weight distribution. The ship itself tilts forward, the balloons stay straight
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:41:30 The balloons themselves would need to be moved forward quite a few blocks to center it like that
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:42:13 And I REALLLLLYY do not want to rebuild those things
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:42:25 Getting those elongated sphere shapes are a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:42:35 well, tedious at minimum
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:42:42 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:43:24 Thanks for the help you guys btw
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:45:56 Okay, I'll try
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:46:14 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:46:51 Idk, I haven't started yet
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:46:59 Probably the right side
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:47:36 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:48:08 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:49:22 Wait, does restitution make the rope firmer or looser?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:49:59 Idk what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:01 Add them where?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:22 I agree
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:53 I feel sorry for the people in my server
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:55 ;c
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:52:17 https://gyazo.com/27eec6454af1e9554cc39f7f3284ba96 Well I've almost got it balanced out
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:21 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:30 oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:34 He didn't do anything wrong :c
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:35 Yes?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:41 I am
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:48 Lots of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:55:49 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:56:09 Probably an unnecessary amount
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:56:19 It was just a joke tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:56:21 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:56:39 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:57:56 What the
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:58:08 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:58:09 Why cant I move my build down
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:58:14 >.>
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:58:59 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:59:31 So if I want my ropes to be closer to poles of iron, do I make their restitution high or no?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:06:39 Im getting close to getting this thing done
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:06:41 ;o
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:14:21 <@!216371990959882241> Are the propeller motors supposed to be locked? The sideways ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:14:28 Because mine flatten out
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:15:44 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:17:00 Also turbo
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:17:13 If I want super stiff ropes do I make the restitution higher or lower?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:17:58 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:23:43 Well, I would say i've gotten my airship to work
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:23:53 I just have to make the back heavier now and add a way to steer
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:24:07 Thank you <@!216371990959882241> for the propeller tip
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:25:33 💩 build this
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:25:50 propeller motors are motors that use propellers
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:10 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:12 that use
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:12 they are motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:14 propellers
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:18 attached to them
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:23 I do get you
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:26 Theres only motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:30 if you attach propellers to them
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:33 they become propeller motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:26:40 Lmao ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:57:32 Restitution makes my ship vibrate hard
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:57:33 rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:58:52 Do rope ladders work?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:59:45 Like, could you make a ladder from rope and be able to climb it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:59:50 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:59:50 I know thats why im asking
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:00:08 I guess ill try
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:00:25 Damn this build is almost 4k blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:00:29 I might get server exterminator
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:00:40 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:04:09 Woah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:04:14 rope ladders work way better than I thought
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:32:27 yEs
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:32:31 I've finished it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:32:33 https://gyazo.com/9b2943a14b50bfedbdd4b3342310936e
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:32:50 Smooth sailing
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:33:23 It just takes a bit of patience to pilot
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:33:47 Have to micromanage the balloons' rotation

plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:26:54 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:28:05 Could I get the lag overseer rank for what I just posted in creations? It doesn't meet the pitch/roll requirement, but that's because that's not the kind of ship it is. It does everything else fine
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 16:28:14 If that's not allowed it's okay

plane-crazy 2019-03-09 16:21:29 Im sure it is possible
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 16:21:43 But from ***MY EXPERIENCE AND SEEING OTHER PEOPLES TANKS*** they have always been inconsistent

plane-crazy 2019-03-09 18:56:36 Nvm figured it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:17:49 I would say it's how you make it walk, not just the fact that it CAN walk
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:18:22 Thats like saying you can't make a unique suspension system that nobody else has made because someone's already made a suspension system

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:57:56 The wheel turns when you steer

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:09 Helium blocks dont work that way
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:20 Instead of lifting where you put them, they take weight away from the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:23 Trust me, I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:28 I had the same issue with my air ship
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:37 Instead of using helium, stick ballasts at max weight on the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:01:54 Np
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:02:36 Np :)
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:10:46 <@427454208292421653> Did ballasts fix your issue
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:10:47 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:13:33 <@427454208292421653> For future reference, don't assume helium will lift your craft unless it's attached with rope. In roblox helium is basically just blocks with negative density. Attaching them to a craft without rope or something similar will just decrease it's overall weight

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 04:22:21 people with obc just make money sitting around doing nothing
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 04:22:44 Of course some people still have their lifetime obc

plane-crazy 2019-03-11 13:01:23 But the ranks channel doesn't specify that the creation HAS to be complicated
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 13:01:27 Only that it has to be unique

plane-crazy 2019-03-12 10:34:03 Half wedges are glitched atm
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 10:34:07 They dont save their color for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-12 11:35:57 <@!322970944303923200> blocks were recently made to be heavier, so that might be why
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 20:04:05 yes

plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:07:09 Wym "swashplate on a plane ok"
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:07:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:07:56 The rotating wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:08:22 Planes can have swashplates
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:08:30 It's literally just a propeller
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:08:58 Then what the hell is a swashplate
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:10:01 https://gyazo.com/a61f69c1574412388d99ee172c36a1a3
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:10:23 A device to translate motion of a rotating shaft
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:10:29 sounds like a propeller to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:11:14 That's the definition google gives for a swashplate
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:11:19 :v
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:11:38 Yes, wikipedia did
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:12:20 https://gyazo.com/80ac0a921a894f1462edf10569afd077
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:12:23 are you sure about that
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:12:45 I didn't feel it was relevant
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:13:29 Lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:13:36 I didn't know there were multiple?
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:13:51 How the fuck am I supposed to know
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:13:55 I don't get into this shit
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:14:23 I'm not going to bother doing something like that for something so menial.
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:14:34 Stop making it out like I've committed some grave crime.
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:15:04 I'm exagerating
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:15:20 I'll exaggerate if I want to exaggerate
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:15:28 ;v
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:16:00 I didn't exaggerate anything fact related
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:16:33 In the context of exaggeration proving someone wrong when correct facts are shown, they would have to be exaggerating facts.
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:16:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:17:07 It was implied
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:17:25 Nobody was arguing though
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:17:37 We are NOW
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:17:44 But before hand it was just a simple misunderstanding
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:17:49 Because I got the wrong definition
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:18:04 Not always, but in this case yes.
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:18:27 Why are you so aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:19:23 I'm pretty sure most people will interpret "yeah no shit" as agreeing aggressively
plane-crazy 2019-03-13 21:19:48 It's aggressive
