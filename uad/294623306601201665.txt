plane-crazy 2021-05-07 21:45:51 i press w (foward), it goes backwards
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 21:53:09 is there a way to place conveyors with the controls already set?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 21:53:23 like you set it first then place them all with those settings
general 2021-05-07 21:55:33 why did you block the names
general 2021-05-07 21:56:34 we have 20k members, 2k active, and 10 talking
general 2021-05-07 21:56:54 and you think we're gonna go to a pokimane tweet to bash on them?

general 2021-05-07 23:33:34 the actual conveyor part
general 2021-05-07 23:34:11 when you can paint tiny ass parts of trails but not conveyors
general 2021-05-07 23:34:38 guess my newgrounds tank will be inaccurate

general 2021-05-07 23:35:58 what is this games problem
general 2021-05-07 23:36:41 when a game with potential that has community support doesn't get updated! ðŸ˜³
general 2021-05-07 23:36:52 tf2
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 00:50:10 this game isnt even about planes anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 00:50:16 nobody builds planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 00:53:05 amen
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 00:53:14 im making planes like intended
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:00:28 i made the game thumbnail plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:03:00 or 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:13:38 is there a block thats like a straight diagonal block
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:06 like a parellogram
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:25 but its height than length
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:32 i cant send images
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:39 but i hope you understand what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:43 no not cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:32:21 how does my newgrounds tank look so far?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:32:37 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:09 its hard when i cant make it look exact
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:27 well its a cartoon tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:37 and i cant make it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:49 theres literally no way i can make the overhang smaller
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:34:25 also the devs thought "lets make it so you can paint the conveyor wedges, but not normal ones"
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:35:57 fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:36:03 more roundd
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:36:16 ima buy robux to get speakers
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:36:22 to blast "Ugh" in the tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:37:11 when he said "e e er e uh e eh, ereaereaerare E e e e er e uh e eh, er I e I e, Ugh!" i felt that
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:39:23 i might try and make the tank bigger in a few weeks but lemme get the design down first
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:44:35 yeah i learned that
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:45:54 which one looks better
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:45:56 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:46:04 i have a third design
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:50:12 3rd isnt that good looking
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:50:49 guess its 2 with a unanimous vote
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:04:32 end of today update
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:04:35 good night for now
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:04:48 newgrounds tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:33:02 the worst feeling is learning you sized the thing wrong so you have to start all over again to make it a little bigger
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:35:00 i really wanna start all over again since i sized the tank wrong but i also dont
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:35:06 might finish it now then make it bigger later
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:35:57 you know what im gonna do it
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:36:03 better now than later
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:37:15 rn its 7 by 6, ill make it like 9 x 7 this time
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:37:25 im not fully starting over tho, just making it a little bigger
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:37:49 no just the main center part
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:38:02 the tank wheel treads things will be 3 wide'
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:38:16 itll come out better
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:46:22 i think since the main tank wheel treads part is the main difficulty of it (i havent even made the barrel yet aaaaaaa), im gonna make the treads first, THEN the main body
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:46:36 so right tread, body, left tread
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:46:37 ez
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:49:22 you guys dont use fps unlocker?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:49:34 max graphics for me is 120fps
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:49:43 i have a 1660ti
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:57:33 like
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:57:33 god wish it was faster to copy something from your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:58:09 like copying one side of your build and mirror it
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 22:58:10 Sadge
