general 2021-02-19 21:59:10 hi
general 2021-02-19 21:59:18 bye
help 2021-02-19 22:01:47 how do I get roles in this server?
help 2021-02-19 22:05:01 is there a rank that allows you to post images?
help 2021-02-19 22:07:59 and how might I go about obtaining it?
help 2021-02-19 22:08:44 ah ok
general 2021-02-25 15:26:08 what does it mean when it says you can adjust the speed of a rope?
general 2021-02-25 15:26:50 ?
general 2021-02-25 15:26:57 I am confused
general 2021-02-25 15:27:53 why is it called speed then?
general 2021-02-25 15:28:20 but when I set it to max it doesn't change
general 2021-02-25 15:28:25 the time is the same
general 2021-02-25 15:29:44 I just put two ropes side by side and set one to max speed and there's no difference
general 2021-02-25 23:24:51 I would recommend dropping napalm on Vietnamese farming villages as I find great pleasure in watching a giant fire ball turn houses and innocent people into ash
general 2021-02-25 23:25:25 *oops wrong server*
general 2021-02-25 23:26:13 crime crime
general 2021-03-01 14:38:23 I only just noticed this but the devs make it so that it replaces your message with "<-- scammer" when you say the words "free robux"?
general 2021-03-01 14:38:44 this is new
general 2021-03-01 14:39:25 but I remember it not censoring "free robux" not to long ago
general 2021-03-01 14:43:29 <@!587393222855229457> it only changes to <-- scammer in plane crazy for me
general 2021-03-01 14:43:50 roblox does censor it but I think the devs did something
general 2021-03-01 14:44:41 no warning appeared
general 2021-03-01 14:45:09 in other games "free robux" is just censored
general 2021-03-01 14:45:22 not changed to <-- scammer

plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:22:12 ingame signs
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:22:23 I want to put a keyboard on a sign
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:23:19 how does the filter even work it's worse than the roblox filter
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:23:35 omg bro have you even played plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:23:41 there are sign blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:23:47 which you can type stuff on
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:24:02 lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:24:32 but seriously help me
do you know how to type ⌨️ onto a sign without the filter?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:24:52 I swear if it's impossible I'm gonna be pissed
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:25:50 nope no amount of keyboards work
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:26:56 I have no choice rn
but have you ever put ⌨️ on a sign?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:27:01 idk did it work for you?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:27:03 if you did
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:27:31 ok nah I'm block this mf
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:27:49 no it don't
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:28:18 :/
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:28:34 maybe it will magically work when I come back another time
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:29:25 ...
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:29:35 ok god is out for me
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:29:53 or some roblox admin or some shit
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:30:29 k ima save and join other servers
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:36:07 bruh tf is this 
does the game need me to 200yrs old or some shit why doesn't this stupid sign work
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:37:05 huh 
like on the plot or build?
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:37:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:39:44 no this mf game still won't let me
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:41:12 it doesn't matter what I do I just am not allowed to put a keyboard on a sign for absolutely no reason
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:43:04 this is worse than roblox moderation and that's saying something
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:43:38 at this point completely removing the filter would prob be less problematic to everyone
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 17:44:49 not like I can do anything else
creations-chat 2022-02-04 07:41:31 lol mans was warned for posting weg

creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:44:26 would there be any way to add suspension to each leg? rn I'm just using rockets but otherwise this thing can't climb over small hills and stuff I think due to poor contact area
creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:47:14 
creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:53:55 I am doing that but idk what are good settings tho
creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:56:33 yeah idk is acting all weird might just stick to the rocket boost
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:03 why do disconnector not work???
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:38 see the problem is they worked
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:44 and now they don't
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:49 like I didn't change much
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:56 bruh...
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 11:59:59 why
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:00:42 bruh that's so dumb
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:01:16 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:01:25 see but the thing is for me
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:01:32 after I spawn again they don't work
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:01:39 so they literally only work once
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:02:25 I tried removing everything that could be obstructing the disconnection despite the fact that they worked before and no
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:02:30 yes it is on
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:02:52 default
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:03:01 ok I had to kinda turn off and on and now it works
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:03:11 but I swear if I have to do that every time
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:03:34 oh great
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:03:49 I really do just get like two chances to use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:03:51 great
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:04:00 back to not working even when I turn off then on
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:04:02 fuck this
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:06:46 pvp mode does not work either
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:06:50 some bullshit
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:07:05 I can only use disconnectors once then I have to rejoin or some crap
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:08:15 I change control still does not work...
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:14:56 well that's interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:15:12 if disconnectors are attached to something that is anchored they don't work
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:15:21 well at least they aren't completely broken
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:28:45 oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:28:47 thnx
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 12:28:57 forgot about that

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:36:51 I want it to be "fat" if you will
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:37:38 oop
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:37:50 several plots long? is it very slender boi?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:40:01 I mean it's not neccesarily as bad as accidentally deleting the entire thing or not saving hours of progress
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:40:47 I remember seeing one supermassive build in creations and I still have no idea how it was done
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:41:07 elephant plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:43:39 still waiting for some feedback on this airship nose
am I on the right track?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:44:25 I have it on 8
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:45:27 better?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:45:39 imagine having more than 26 robux

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:48:53 oh literally just rescale
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:48:59 can you make it smaller tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:49:02 imagine
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:49:26 there should def be a feature to move individual parts or entire groups of parts
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:49:41 like fr if something is wrong you have to restart
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:54:23 how to breath 
step 1) open mouth/nostrils 
step 2) expand your lungs to create a tiny vacuum thus sucking in air
step 3) contract your lungs thus pushing out the carbon dioxide 
step 4) smash the hard drives containing records of #^@#$^%#@#^^^&^*%$@#^%
general 2023-06-09 10:42:45 man I love racism
