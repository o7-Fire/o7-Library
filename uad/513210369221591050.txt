creations-chat 2020-10-13 03:37:55 Who are the staff here besides V0xelBox, purifiedwater, Arjunn_, RoboRail1, and Yousuf?
I've contacted all them to request HoF but none of their Dms are on.

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:44:50 hey purified, any update on my request? I pinged you the info yesterday
creations-chat 2020-11-30 06:42:39 I don't understand this dude’s thought process, you’ll still get warned even if it’s other’s build or ping the creator. Like everyone said, you posted it.
