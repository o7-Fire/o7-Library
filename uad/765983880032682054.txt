creations-chat 2021-09-13 21:44:30 chinook progress
interior needs to be ajusted a bit, outside needs a bit of detail and general control needs to be fixed, and a new paint too. appart from that my build's kinda good
creations-chat 2021-09-13 21:58:14 yeah ik, want to fix that too, but it's not on my priority list rn
i mostly need to fix motor lock error and add more things
creations-chat 2021-09-13 22:00:30 it's good, just a bit blocky
creations-chat 2021-09-13 22:02:31 I also tried adding a door under it, to make a sort of rope come out, but I saw it as "unoriginal" since most people do that
creations-chat 2021-09-13 22:07:15 k, can I see without test mode?
creations-chat 2021-09-13 22:09:38 i think it's mostly the back the problem, it's kinda too chunky. you can try using half wedges
creations-chat 2021-09-13 22:12:45 but apart from that it's good

Now that you understand what's in the image. I'm trying to make every small individual wings go all random directions everytime I click q/e.
but the settings for that are a bit hard to understand because each motor is connected to the wing before it's own. So anyone can help me figure out what settings to put on the motors, cause my brain bugging a lot with this. If you need more info just ask

creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:34:52 nice, but the color is a bit ish, like not much color detail
also feel like theres a proportion problem, but might just be me
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:37:42 like it's supposed to be long, and the turret is supposed to be slim, the fume extractor is a bit too blocky, maybe change that, and wheres the machine gun!
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:39:45 I never did tanks in plane crazy lol
creations-chat 2022-01-13 15:43:21 heres everything :

To much "details"
really blocky turret
turret is way too big
tracks are missing
main gun is too blocky
theres no machine gun
proportions turret/body are bad

good things :

it looks like a tank
