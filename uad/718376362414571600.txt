general 2021-06-06 21:50:31 This probs isn't that impressive but is it cool that I took a Bugatti Bolide from an internet tutorial.....and made it fly and hover? IDK Someone please tell me if its cool
general 2021-06-06 21:51:56 okie
general 2021-06-06 21:55:09 there
general 2021-06-06 21:55:15 I sent screenshots..
general 2021-06-06 21:55:32 no I sent via DM
general 2021-06-06 21:56:04 like the body is from tutorial but I poured countless hours into the functionality of it
general 2021-06-06 21:56:49 kk
general 2021-06-06 21:56:56 its my most advanced build
general 2021-06-06 21:57:03 im not good with aethstetics
general 2021-06-06 21:58:04 but if you give me a solid car, a few hours and some hover thrusters... I should be able to make it fly.
