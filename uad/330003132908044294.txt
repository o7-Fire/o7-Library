plane-crazy 2021-04-07 16:57:40 What if shredders get some lore
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 16:59:40 Maybe they’re some kind of superweapon made by losing armies, an alien race feeding on other aircraft or like what  Nepu#1743 said, a bunch o evolved cheese graters
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 17:06:32 The first of all shredders

creations-chat 2022-03-16 01:22:04 Ohhhhhhh I love the community of this game……
creations-chat 2022-03-16 01:36:14 The guy who made the house thing could’ve prevented what just happened if he went with a different response in the first place, maybe you could’ve asked what to fix instead.
The guy commenting on it is bit of a douche tbh but i still kinda agree with his opinion. Maybe a better set of words could’ve prevented all that tho but looking from his direction he probably found the high upvotes too outrageous to be left alone.
creations-chat 2022-03-16 01:40:28 Well, it’s the plane crazy community
