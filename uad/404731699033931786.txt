plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:16:00 hello
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:04:24 i love using the anchor blocks to just stop mid-air, but i kinda feel it would be unfair in PVP
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:38:47 Buzzy by HerpedyDerp, block count is 59
i designed this to be that buzz in the ear of larger aircrafts
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:43:39 im a bee

plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:00:52 you know what you're doing
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:08:46 if you want more manuverability you want the COL lower than the COM or closer to the COM or both
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:09:12 try adding more wings, it probbably doesn't have enough lift
general 2018-11-24 15:15:06 <:kermit:506299097079218196>
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:15:39 maybe maybe not, if you want more stability have your wings longer out from the craft but for manuverability have them closer to the craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:16:14 wait what is the pinned message?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:16:21 i know what it is but why is it there?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:18:10 this is like the free version of ksp, only its multiplayer and theres combat
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:18:31 i can use ksp physics to improve my planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:18:43 exactly! so its a lot better!
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:25:23 has anybody made an ornithopter yet?

plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:25:45 its basically a mechanical bird
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 15:25:58 like you only use wings to get movement
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 20:38:19 sorry but no penguins are allowed
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 20:39:22 we need more taxes

the-dump 2018-12-11 23:11:50 Chungus has no beginning. Chungus has no end. Chungus is infinite. Millions of years after our civilization has been eradicated and forgotten, Chungus will endure.
Chungus is eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existance.
We are but rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. We touch Chungus' mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.
Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident. Our lives are measured in years and decades. We wither and die. Chungus is eternal. Before it, we are nothing.
Chungus imposes order on the chaos of organic life. We exist because Chungus allows it, and we will end because Chungus demands it.
Chungus transcends our very understanding. We cannot grasp the nature of Chungus' existence.

bug-reports 2021-07-09 03:11:04 I found a potential User Fix for the rocket dissapearing bug, just hard system resetted my pc and my rockets are back and not dissapearing whenever I am firing while moving

now to think of it the DID dissapear after I did that previously.
bug-reports 2021-07-09 13:53:34 I went into system settings and reset my pc, and did the full wipe thing that removes personal files and user preferences.

previously when I had done that on it's "smaller" setting which keeps your files and user preferences my rockets broke, they wouldn't fire if I was moving and instead would just dissapear.

help 2022-11-15 15:43:00 I need some help, my cutters aren't wokring on this trough-weapon I made to trail behind my aircraft, me and my friend tested the trough with blacklist enabled and it didn't cut shit at high and low speed.

I made another cutter that was on the ground and cut his vehichle just fine, so it's just an issue with this design/being in the air/being on ropes
help 2022-11-15 15:53:36 because it was a fun idea to take me out of my comfort zone
