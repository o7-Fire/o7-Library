creations-chat 2021-02-21 22:26:22 Criticsm encouraged, I do realize it needs more paint, as well as the Tower should probably be moved
creations-chat 2021-02-27 10:17:26 Well, there are a lot of things that don't exist in this game that do exist, I thought, why not
creations-chat 2021-02-27 10:27:04 Yeah they don't put camo's on them because the paint is meant to blend in with the environment they operate at. That looks more like a paintjob to represent maybe clouds or mist
