general 2020-03-20 01:25:07 <@!233400315116781579> for the vtol, can it use super rockets to negate the weight of the "aesthetics" of the engines
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 01:40:57 ye my stuff is garbage compared to urs so i would hate to see it next to the awesome stuff most people here make

plane-crazy 2020-03-22 01:47:46 it started out as a rock
plane-crazy 2020-03-22 01:48:46 i did

general 2020-04-10 14:51:49 i just gave 4 people a ride to the egg in my vtol, dropped them off, got the egg, then i left them on the floating isle, they are stuck
general 2020-04-10 14:52:12 they are new to it and play for egg
general 2020-04-10 14:52:21 i should apply for vtol
general 2020-04-10 14:52:52 its pretty much a osprey
general 2020-04-10 14:53:02 verynoob
general 2020-04-10 14:53:17 its a osprey but its a passenger boat thing
general 2020-04-10 14:53:51 ooh i could get vtol II
general 2020-04-10 14:55:54 whats sad is my vtol is better than my heli, but has the same amout of time put in and the heli is simpler and should be better
