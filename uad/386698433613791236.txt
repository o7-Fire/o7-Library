plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:43:56 is there any tricks i may not know about to help make my jets not so slow?
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:44:52 well ive got a "fa18" loaded with just about everything i could think of to speed it up but it still only hits like 200
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:45:44 super rocket engines or jet engines. ive tried both didnt notice a difference
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:46:14 right now im using entirely super rockets and like i said, only hit 200 so idk
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:46:51 i wanna say 10, its the most i could conceal in the frame
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:47:24 i have 12 total
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:47:33 including the 2 jet engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 02:48:23 I cant send the jet but if you want i can send you the jet in dms gam3
