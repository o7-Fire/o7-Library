general 2021-12-16 18:32:57 but how do i show that I am "gud"
general 2021-12-16 18:33:53 Why does every society have inpenetrable status circles
general 2021-12-16 18:34:28 Example : 
to get rich you have to be rich
to get image perms you **need** to have image perms
general 2021-12-16 18:35:01 welp, I can still upgrade my plane
general 2021-12-16 18:35:05 while I am here
general 2021-12-16 18:35:53 To show show something good u need image perms, and to get image perms, you need to show something good XD

general 2021-12-17 14:39:25 Hello everyone
general 2021-12-17 14:49:31 ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:51:04 guys, did the missiles'/rockets' tracking get nerfed ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:51:55 also, is there a way to turn off the blocks breaking in PVP mode, my pc breaks when my plane gets destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:52:17 not that
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:52:33 i mean, when ur plane breaks, the blocks have a break effect
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:53:59 no not god mode
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:54:22 What I mean is that when blocks breaks, multiple parts appear and it make ur game lag
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:54:50 Is there a way to turn that off like having only the broken blocks disappear
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:55:14 I get hit when setting up my plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:12:10 Guys, if I motor lock control surfaces together, will it still work ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:12:42 I am thinking of motor locking the control surfaces onto my wing panels to hide the gaps
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:13:23 I don't think so
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:13:36 thx
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:13:55 Which button ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 10:17:32 It's the same one that desactivate the snow to get the snow blaster thing ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 12:53:38 Anyone know a way to stop a plane from bouncing when u turn with it ?
general 2021-12-18 13:55:30 I should build the thing in the video where the dude just hit the breaks and go behind the other plane.
general 2021-12-18 13:56:52 what game is it from ?
general 2021-12-18 13:58:04 what type of game is it ?
general 2021-12-18 13:58:09 except war
general 2021-12-18 13:58:21 do you build vehicules ?
general 2021-12-18 13:58:36 nicea
general 2021-12-18 13:58:41 imma try it out
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 17:51:52 guys, can the pilot seat (blue one) control the plane at the same time as the main pilot seat ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 17:52:34 is there a way to disconnect stuffs from the pilot chair ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 17:54:29 i mean make the pilot seat not able to control the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 09:35:59 good morning for those in europe
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:50:51 I just motor locked 3 wings of control panles together and the manoeuvering is still bad af
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:58:49 i did
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:58:59 but i wanted to add mouse control too
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:59:01 for better aiming
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:59:34 So i motor locked 2 wings of control panels onto my wings but it doen't seem to work
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 08:59:56 for now i just made the control panels use keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 11:47:58 what is an airbrake ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 11:49:28 Ok imma try to build one on my plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:24:12 Is it best to have the lift center (blue thing) nearest as possible to the center of mass of the plane ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:24:35 Does it help with handeling?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 09:25:33 thx
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 10:00:17 how do u make it so long yet so thick ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 10:00:39 how did u overcome the hight limit ? <@!457827362520694790>
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 10:01:01 ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 10:01:09 but with that thickness...
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 18:30:43 does adding propellers at the tip and tail of the plane help wih handeling up and down ? with the propellers at the tip to go up when going up and the one athe tail to go down and vice versa ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 18:32:37 ye kinda but with propellers
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:01:54 Guys, there is a bug where ths sparkler doesn't save it's direction
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:02:26 so I just need to not use sparkler
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:03:14 so i have to rotate my build 90 degree ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:04:20 just the turret ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:05:31 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:05:45 so when i load it, it faces the right side
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:26:21 the earth is rotating on it's self and the satelite is rotating around the earth
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:26:29 And we call it orbiting
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:27:11 the satelite orbits around the earth by using the earth's gravity and launch force
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:28:00 tbh, the satelite is technically falling to the earth
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:28:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:29:10 the satellite is free diving to the earth but it can't cuz another force is pushing it away (the forces at it's launch)
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:30:46 this is gravity in 2D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:31:04 wait...
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:31:12 do u need pic perms to post videos ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:34:15 u should should debate about this is general
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:34:20 or in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:36:56 mass bends a sort of field that we call space, so to visualize it in 2D, the sun is a giant bowling ball on a blanket stretched out, it make the blanket bend aroud it so everything (ball) near it will want to fall towards it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:38:58 how do i mkae a thread ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:39:34 in 3D, mass bends space, in 4D mass bends time
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:40:28 ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:40:32 forgot to add
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:40:43 cuz like playing plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:41:04 I am like thinking and talking about this while playing sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:42:37 Go whatch this for a 2D representation of gravity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:42:53 ye
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:42:54 ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:42:57 They said it
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:43:08 **Cuz the whole set is affected by gravity itself**
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:43:19 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:43:49 the whole set they made is affected by gravity and that it is 2D plain.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:45:42 see 3
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:46:03 To put it in game perspective, we can see X Y and Z
And in most games, there is a sort of timer to make everything run that will be our "4thD" (time)
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:47:22 I am a time bender, i can make 12 hours past in 30 mins by going to bed
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:48:11 ur kinda the wrong guy here...
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:48:46 wait... we can see time, cuz we can remeber something that is past our "time"
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:49:23 Welp, imma go to bed and become a time bender
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:49:36 good night for those in western europe
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:50:29 we can move our eyes side ways... so we see 2D, but we can also move them up and down so we see 3D
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:50:38 that is our brain perspective
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:50:47 so we technically see it
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 13:48:57 for some reason, in plane crazy the best planes to build for PVP are those from the 3-4th generation fighter jets.
I built a bunch and the ebst ones were those.especially the f14 in my opinion is thebest
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 13:49:21 lack of space to work with
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 13:51:57 did plane crazy just get a lag fix ?
I can finally run 50fps on a server full of big builds
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 14:01:12 I kmikz others with 6 mouse controled planes
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 14:32:09 anyone played Babft before playing plane crazy ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 15:06:24 guys- i have an idea...
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 15:06:40 Ill build the BABFT's boat in it's icon\
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 09:55:59 good morning to those in Western Europe
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 12:05:04 guys, once pc2 comes out will u guys rebuild your builds with the new wedges ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 12:05:33 Cpt.Philipe ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 12:06:32 for me ill be just optimising my block count
bot-central 2021-12-23 14:58:50 ok
bot-central 2021-12-23 15:05:03 &suggest
**[New Effect switch in pvp mode ?]**

**[Other] [PVP]**

**[Description :]**
So when you die in PVP mode, your build just crumbles down into many 'parts' which is very laggy considering it also has physics.
So add a switch in the setting's menu where you can turn that off so that like- your build just despawns.
It is meant to help people with bad PC (like me) to not crash when dying. (don't laugh, dying is normal in pvp mode)
bot-central 2021-12-23 15:05:10 ...
bot-central 2021-12-23 15:05:19 i have no idea how this suggestion thing works
