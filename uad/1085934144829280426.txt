general 2023-07-07 01:26:15 The bearded Reedling is the forbidden stress ball.
general 2023-07-07 01:28:36 I really wanna squish a bearded reedling like a stress ball. It just looks like it be very nice to hold
general 2023-07-07 01:29:46 Idk what going on but I’m rooting for it.
general 2023-07-07 01:30:35 The funny thing is. I don’t only like old automobiles. I also like Steam Locoomotives, aircraft, vessels. Basically most transportation.
general 2023-07-07 01:30:56 *grabs popcorn* this entertaining even though I have no clue what happening
general 2023-07-07 01:41:07 Why are state flags confusing. There’s literally 25 with just a dark blue background. I ain’t memorizing every single emblem.
general 2023-07-07 01:41:57 Well the ones that actually can be told apart are fine. But the 25 that are almost the same except emblem changed are too confusing
general 2023-07-07 01:42:23 Like, I get NY and Penn flag confused. But have ya seen someone get NY mixed up with like New Mexico?
