general 2022-06-01 10:29:25 so, i saw smth about the "shredders" in plane crazy recently
general 2022-06-01 10:29:57 im just a newbie, returning to the game, so i'm wondering how you can make one yourself
general 2022-06-01 10:30:38 it's more of a way to reverse engineer them
general 2022-06-01 10:31:07 i'm not good with the basics of mouse-controlled turrets 😅
general 2022-06-01 10:31:50 well, i'm a dude who drives a rocket buggy so, i want extra accuracy
general 2022-06-01 10:32:27 well i'm bad with aerodynamics and windflows 😛
general 2022-06-01 10:32:58 ohhhh okie
general 2022-06-01 10:33:00 👍
general 2022-06-01 10:33:04 thought it did
general 2022-06-01 10:57:26 hey guys, i found a really good way to counter shredders trying to ram you
general 2022-06-01 10:57:30 use anchor blocks
general 2022-06-01 10:57:40 i had my fair share of fighting with a shredder
general 2022-06-01 10:57:57 beated a kid 'till he used his shredder cuz he angy
general 2022-06-01 11:02:21 well i didn't account for that 😅
general 2022-06-01 11:02:35 do pardon me, i'm just speculating
general 2022-06-01 11:05:50 i love the machine guns!
general 2022-06-01 11:06:06 basic gun setup and wow it works wonders
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:12:23 how do you get image permissions?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:12:35 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:12:40 how can i do that?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:12:44 the lvl3?

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:32:42 here's a tip, my friend! when building with submarines with triangles, try making them "squashed"
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:33:08 ah, k 😅
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:33:55 make it like an oval
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:34:23 i do alot of asset creation for the few games i do
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:34:36 i noticed alot of the submarine models looked bad with trinagles
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:34:51 using oval shapes is best way to make it look good, friend!
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:34:54 😄
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:35:24 done right it will make wonders
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:35:41 no, the height is shorter than the width
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 11:38:12 forgive me for breaking in, but let's not stray from the topic shall we?

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:02:48 i love ace combat fighters, they look really fun to play with
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:02:54 i'm going to try and recreate one
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:10:22 i'm trying to make a 2-way symetry boat
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:10:38 looks fun but i'm not really talented in naval ship design
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:13:01 well, i can
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:15:05 well, here's a tip when talking to people, alt
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:15:35 when they say stuff like my ancesstors bla bla bla you know it's best to not talk about it any longer
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:16:00 remember, control your speech as to not let the others take control!
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:18:08 now that's the correct course of action to take!
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:18:09 🥰
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:25:30 Anyone here with a simple guide to making planes?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:25:39 it's been very long ever since i made one
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:26:09 it's a sub
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:27:02 i think he meant something erotic
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:27:20 an innuendo of sorts
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:37:07 why is he hated so much here?
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:37:22 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:37:25 it's understandable
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 12:37:32 i've met plenty

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:00:17 greenscale model
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:00:40 yes, submersible one at that!
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:01:11 it's a passion of mine to do 3d modelling
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:01:15 but my computer is too weak
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:01:33 tried using Wings3d, din't run well even if it was really that simple
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:03:34 oh, use the disconnector
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:03:44 bind rocket to that
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:03:50 and bam, torpedo!
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:04:04 oh, the PT boat?

plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:04:31 
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 13:05:06 you don't really have a way to replicate the same as-is but you can try making it so it falls down when you turn

general 2022-06-01 13:28:09 guys i forgot my normal pills
general 2022-06-01 13:28:11 💀
general 2022-06-01 13:28:41 you knew things were going full 11 when people tried to climb the tree
general 2022-06-01 13:29:01 i loved pixel gun 3d

general 2022-06-01 13:35:36 huh, it's more different than what i remembered
general 2022-06-01 13:35:45 was that the old kitchen map?
general 2022-06-01 13:35:55 yeah
general 2022-06-01 13:35:59 it is
general 2022-06-01 13:36:03 yep

general 2022-06-01 13:37:20 yeah, sniper war
general 2022-06-01 13:37:30 sniper everywhere!!!!
general 2022-06-01 13:37:40 i loved default starter sniper gun
general 2022-06-01 13:37:45 it was actually really good
general 2022-06-01 13:37:52 i used it like a battle rifle
general 2022-06-01 13:54:31 it is suprising how fast that went
general 2022-06-01 15:05:10 perfect, execute operation: "HRT Showerwash"
general 2022-06-01 15:05:46 me 2
general 2022-06-01 15:06:06 🤝
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:17:08 my very first working plane in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 16:18:17 it has near-perfect ratios for avoiding the vehicle from tilting up or down too much
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 02:22:16 spherical sub sketching
general 2022-06-02 05:05:03 a very cool plane, actually
general 2022-06-02 05:06:33 Lean?
general 2022-06-02 05:07:49 what's so wrong with them?
general 2022-06-02 05:10:43 uh, guys? aren't we not allowed to become really rude to people in chat?
general 2022-06-02 05:11:21 i'm just baffled by how rude ppl here can get just because of small things
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:14:24 wow, that's really smooth!
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:14:33 motorlocking?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:15:19 well, for a beginner like me it looks certainly like one !😆
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:18:28 what are conveyors for?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:18:43 they interact with vehicles, yeah?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:20:18 oh wait, the conveyors can move like tank treads
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 05:21:20 can you show me an example?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 06:09:24 yayyyyy
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 06:11:51 i did not expect it to be this fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 07:53:47 it was annoying to line up shots
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:09:14 slught modifications to my plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:09:47 yeah, which is why i put those turrets
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:08 it actually has to use the firing of the turrets to cover up it's defense
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:16 you shoot to defend, ironically
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:37 and you can just shoot the enemy at any angle so it doesn't suffer much
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:43 only problem is thrust
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:13 typical rank hierachy behaviour
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:54 amazing, i saw that
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:58 you deleted my msg
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:13:37 huh, then why did you msg's deletion also happened to mine
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:13:49 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:14:16 cmon just shoot all the time😭
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:14:23 i try to weave alot
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:14:49 it's up to how you control it, most flaws are dependent on pilot anyways
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:15:17 belkan magick!
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:16:25 im no't going to post it lel 😆
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:16:39 i know my stuff is really bad anyways 😃
general 2022-06-02 09:53:38 when do we get spaceships <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
general 2022-06-02 09:55:58 how to get a fursuit
general 2022-06-02 09:56:14 💀
general 2022-06-02 09:58:17 do we have a replica of the Arsenal Bird in pcc?
general 2022-06-02 09:58:45 since we have so many ppl who know/enjoy ace combat franchise
general 2022-06-02 09:59:45 huh yeah there are a few
general 2022-06-02 10:00:51 icelandic
general 2022-06-02 10:01:08 it is icelandic.
general 2022-06-02 10:01:18 seven digits long
general 2022-06-02 10:01:29 354 code
general 2022-06-02 10:01:58 ppl when they hate russian people and not russian govt for no reason:
general 2022-06-02 10:02:29 bro you so woke the red tide 'bout cancel you
general 2022-06-02 10:02:55 you smoke blue glass
general 2022-06-02 10:03:38 i'm lucky my govt is aligned with both the russians and americans <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-06-02 10:04:04 impossible impossible
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 11:55:12 i feel like making a tower today, could use a few ideas from these images
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 11:55:28 onne thing to note is the ridges between the walls
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:20:40 making walls using simple geometry
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:37:44 how does this wall feel?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 13:03:56 current progress on a base project
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 13:16:08 how many thrusters does the normal PVP plane have?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 13:17:02 aesthetics and pvp
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:00:07 wish we had symetry mode 😭
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:01:28 as a person who loves making space-related things, it pains me that we don't have LEO mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:02:07 Low Earth Orbit
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:02:15 the least you can do is reduced grav
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:02:26 so i can get my spaceship battles :D
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:02:49 ye
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:03:18 it'd be sick too, we could have space battles like the ones in The Expanse
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:04:24 sure enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:04:26 lele
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:09:34 with their speed, they would very much stray off course very fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:09:40 remember, no drag in space
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:09:57 and it looks like they can't even do basic braking manuevers lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:10:47 that might work
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:11:20 but once they go full speed, they very much become a near-unmanuverable vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:14:08 at best i think anyone can just about dogde them
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:14:18 they are fast, yes, but you can too
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:14:33 strafing is a very valid way
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:16:13 i just use alot of things that annoy them, like using lights like a flashbang :P
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:16:24 i commonly just flash it so it become annoying
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:16:35 that's how i just make shredders not chase me
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:19:22 for those who didn't see it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:19:31 such true words 😔
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:19:44 shredders are annoying yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:20:06 i see them chase ppl with motorlocked planes more than simple builds alot more
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:21:29 that's just my experience seeing one :(
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 04:21:51 gone 👍
