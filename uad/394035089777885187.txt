general 2020-06-12 03:14:50 one question for anyone to answer
general 2020-06-12 03:15:07 do any of you wish motor2 could lock?
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 03:16:27 one question for anyone to answer:
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 03:16:47 do any of you wish motor2 could be configured to lock?
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 03:18:02 reason why is because im building a complex transformer
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 03:19:31 needs specific degrees to turn different blocks so it fits perfectly in two different forms, but motor2 freaks out and has a seizure when ever it wants
bot-central 2020-06-12 04:17:41 &suggest
Motor 2 Locks
[GAMEPLAY]

[DESCRIPTION]
Add a lock configuration to Motor 2. Motor 2s can freak out when under certain circumstances on complex builds, but when using normal motors they lock and don't freak out. Motor2 doesn't have this configurable option, and using normal motors can't give you precise placements between two different angles/movements. For example: Building a complex Transformer vehicle, motor2 is great for transforming between the two forms, but they freak out. Normal motors are great for keeping everything in place but the form isn't kept correctly. Please consider adding a lock configuration to Motor2.

Example link of Motor2s without locks freaking out:

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:46:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:46:42 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:46:58 i dont need excessive motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:49:27 actually, i got an idea on how to fix this with simple motor locking, but it will add weight so i will need more helium :/
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:49:57 banana rotate
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 12:38:35 <@!200793484053970944> Is this better?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 12:45:14 yes and no, i suppose it gives it some character, but if i were to make it less "gap-filled" then i would need two more rotating motor locks, which i dont really have the space for
general 2021-05-28 12:59:14 ayo
general 2021-05-28 12:59:21 is anyone having trouble joining plane crazy?
general 2021-05-28 12:59:49 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:01:16 ok yall listen
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:01:54 from what ive heard, rick is soft coding the game, from hard code, so we can have better features like whitelisting and copyscripts (obviously with regulations ofc)
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:02:44 correct me if im wrong but, i think the hard code cant support features like that, so he has to rewrite the entire game to softcode to introduce these features
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:03:12 idk when he will finish though, ik hes a busy man and has got other things in life other than plane crazy that he has to manage too
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:04:20 he has to recode the whole game
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:04:30 yes, but not in chunks
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:05:29 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:05:30 new map
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:05:52 copyscripting, and hes considered this, where when you whitelist a person or give them permission, they can copy your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:06:07 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:06:15 more mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:07:15 well also some of the features that he has completed in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:07:32 idk how scripting works but i dont doubt it
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:07:44 no no no
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:07:51 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:07:59 they can but they can get in trouble
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:08:04 its bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:08:36 but rick was considering it as a feature in the new rewrite of the game, you could white list a person or give them permission and they can copy your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:10:31 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/847823678229446696
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:10:58 and if we are able to do this, we can make fighter or bomber plane squads and do rps and such
