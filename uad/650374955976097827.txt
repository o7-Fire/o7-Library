But I'm no plane expert so don't take my opinion for granted

Same, I'll see really good creations get downvotes and it confuses me

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:57:11 5yo's with swarms of cancer fly around
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:57:28 they switch to their box car
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:57:32 and drive over to you
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:57:42 and just sit there waiting for you to spawn
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:58:39 mechs look cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:58:47 but they operate poorly even in their best condition
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 00:59:12 you need to spam keys to get it to slowly take a single step

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:08 i understand not adding detail because pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:10 but
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:18 the cheese grater wings just ruin
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:21 no matter what type
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:36 of plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:46:41 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:47:01 it just completely removes realism
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:47:14 equal to flying with a box plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:47:41 real planes dont use cheese graters
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:47:45 they arent realistic
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:47:46 at all
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:48:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:48:26 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:48:31 yes use that camo
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:50:39 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:50:55 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:51:09 the easiest way around is just slap a motor on your exhaust
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 02:51:22 but to make it truly realistic you would need lot of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:00:22 box with a bunch of huge and large rockets and guns all over the front
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:10 they dont use normal or super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:12 only big
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:35 after they make that creation
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:38 they dont save it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:41 but dont load anything else
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:46 they use it for a while
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:51 and
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:51 then get bored
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 03:01:53 go to youtube

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:49:38 use 1x4 beams instead of 1x1 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:50:20 then you can use normal blocks

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:51:27 a large amount of interaction has to go through all the physics and stuff so it creates lag
