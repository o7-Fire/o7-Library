creations-chat 2021-04-18 17:47:33 WTF
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:50:11 this is actually awesome
creations-chat 2021-04-18 17:51:09 they look very thin (the two other ones)

creations-chat 2021-04-18 17:53:30 going toxic where
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:06:20 maybe cuz theyre jealous B)
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:09:58 it looks like a plain square. try separating the tracks from the body itself a bit and try adding a bit more detail to make it look like its "rough"

wheels also look kinda weird, maybe use a different type of wheel like the cylinder 2 2x2
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:12:50 maybe try adding custom suspension like a bunch of tanks have, and yes, over all the body needs more work because it looks like a smooth piece of butter
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 19:28:44 now make that go at **the speed of light**
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 19:29:01 shut up nou

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 22:41:19 honestly i think that would fry the entire server
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 22:41:30 or just destroy the server's internet connection
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 22:42:03 i cant see the chat
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 22:42:13 ew furry
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:38:25 did you name them all incorrectly

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:38:54 lol he tried so hard to hide the tutorial in it
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:39:24 i know a way to lock but if i want to get into it further it would take me longer

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:18:01 this guy decided to crash the entire pvp server, great.
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:18:42 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:19:36 especially if you are also trying to make it look good

creations-chat 2021-04-21 23:19:00 any details in particular?
creations-chat 2021-04-21 23:21:46 ..i dont see how this narrows anything down

should i size the turret down to one block only?
creations-chat 2021-04-22 00:35:47 yes yes i did too
creations-chat 2021-04-22 01:42:14 the big freighter looking one? because people just dont like how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:58:30 ive always been wondering how SPS relates to MPH
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 23:44:13 anyone know why controls randomly invert when youre building a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:18:29 a bit too wide
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:18:51 maybe try to make it thinner by 1 or 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:19:09 holy crap ive been looking for this
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:19:10 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:19:58 i dont pay attention to the server too often
general 2021-05-21 15:11:48 theres so many dms hes getting
general 2021-05-21 15:11:51 i dont know what to say
general 2021-05-21 15:11:57 the only thing i said is "get harassed"

general 2021-09-10 21:12:17 you
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:05:45 anyone having this issue where motor locking a tank barrel with armament glitches it out now
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:08:59 you could do text on top of the wing and just put a star emoji and make the text size bigger so the star is bigger
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:10:33 idk then
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:14:07 thats sick

plane-crazy 2022-02-25 17:04:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-02-25 17:05:00 linus no no tips
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 18:19:29 bguh
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:57:44 is it just me or i get laggy when i touch the water
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:59:31 i just get laggy whenever i touch it
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:59:37 so basically it renders my ships useless
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 16:00:52 remove the "uwu", convert probably to wasd so the rudder isnt a cheese grater and i recommend a repaint cant give feedback when i cant see majority of the plane
bug-reports 2022-04-21 16:02:39 frame rate drops immediately to like 5 fps whenever you touch water, even if you have a robust pc
bug-reports 2022-04-21 16:23:19 i probably get around that fps but its still incredibly low for me
bug-reports 2022-04-21 16:47:23 it drops with like 100+ block builds
