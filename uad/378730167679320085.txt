plane-crazy 2022-07-28 11:56:54 Surprisingly, I recognize this.
general 2022-09-26 18:17:20 Hm yes

**Bush**
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:19:00 1 wide builds are on a budget, 2 wides and 3 wides are better to choose than making a 1 wide
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:19:31 Looks over performance
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:20:38 You shared it here, so you were looking for an opinion
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:21:26 *But everyone still gives opinions here.*
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:22:47 We don't have to, you showed it just by posting the image of your mirage
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:23:48 *I only came here since a discussion on aircraft fuselage width was going on*
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:26:30 Speaking of building, I am debating on something

Would it be better if I tried making the Chimera or the SP-34R from Project Wingman?
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:29:09 Good idea, but I have already.
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:30:22 *Plus, you could've posted it in <#384025409945337856> instead of here, where people would have given a live opinion.*
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:30:50 Post the Mirage in creations
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:31:37 I never understood camlock ngl
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:32:51 Tomcat Thursday
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:35:17 Anyways I'll ask again, ACG-01 or SP-34R
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:37:33 Man that Mirage is falling apart.

plane-crazy 2022-09-29 18:41:40 Personally I just say go nuts
creations-chat 2022-10-02 19:45:47 My dude that thing is 100% going to be shredder bait
creations-chat 2022-10-26 15:31:34 How do you confuse a Falken for a Darkstar
creations-chat 2022-10-27 19:29:25 What even is going on
I literally had a stroke reading that last message from Flaco.

Ah yes, let me post a build of mine and receive negative criticism like the other builders who made builds similar to mine of the same quality.
creations-chat 2022-10-27 19:36:59 Fighting? More like mocking.

They're judging whatever the hell that is in creations you posted.

It did.
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 20:23:56 This is infact the calmest day in <#384025409945337856>-feedback
general 2022-10-29 14:25:10 Don't do that.
creations-chat 2023-01-01 00:37:34 And the flaps, look at the wings a bit closer and you'll see
general 2023-02-11 02:07:51 Hey random question does anyone know of the name 'Ritualfishy'
general 2023-02-11 02:08:58 Well, just wanna know since someone I'm talking with now mentioned to say his name here and they'd 'tell stories about him'
general 2023-02-11 02:11:21 what
general 2023-02-11 02:14:32 how offensive
creations-chat 2023-02-19 22:52:47 I am well aware, but I am refusing to fix it. (Was debating on getting rid of it, regardless)
creations-chat 2023-02-19 23:08:01 Thanks, but it's still just another F-14, which I probably should have refused to even share, hell you should've seen the other 7 attempts and older versions I've done to try and recreate it.
creations-chat 2023-02-27 08:00:42 What even is going on
WHAT IN GODS NAME
As if being in the PCC isn't harming one mentally already
creations-chat 2023-04-01 00:06:33 It's literally just red?
creations-chat 2023-04-08 02:09:56 Anyone know why things are taking nearly a minute and a half to load in?
(Ex. Messages, Locking, etc.)

Har har, funny... Seriously, cause it took several minutes to load a motor locked build, and a minute and 28 seconds to send a message.
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 09:29:40 Rope & Suspension, that's all I'm gonna say
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 19:59:03 This has been going on for months now after roblox updated physics again.
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:00:02 I think it exceeds that...
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:36:10 I personally don't have the focus to try and get out of being a white name, so I guess I am by choice, not sure.
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 03:57:47 Why would you put helium in the nose of all things
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 04:00:13 By any chance, does the nose use wing panels with a form of angle lock?
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 04:04:28 Tell me you didn't use it like this
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 04:06:13 *if not, I'd alternatively say to use propellers or something with on off stuff, just to help with lift*
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 04:35:50 because I want to and because yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-13 04:41:30 those are disconnectors
creations-chat 2023-06-29 02:48:04 Squircle wheels
creations-chat 2023-06-29 02:51:13 Bro, the wheels really went to wikipedia
creations-chat 2023-06-29 03:14:13 Those wheels are still not circular ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2023-06-30 15:38:53 Could look better at the front

Also, should I make an A-10 or MiG-25?
creations-chat 2023-07-05 00:01:45 I'm pretty sure they want to see the account for another reason lol
Why would someone want to dox you anyways when they barely know you.
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:44:15 Guys, <#498473314445033472> has a use now
