plane-crazy 2022-04-20 09:23:31 Is it just me or the water mechanics have changed
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 09:28:34 I also have that issue
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 09:34:17 Why the water in plane crazy so funni now
plane-crazy 2022-04-20 10:07:48 Are they gonna fix the water issue
creations-chat 2022-04-20 10:11:13 Is it just me or ships are broken
help 2022-04-20 10:54:25 How to fix all the funni physics in water
help 2022-04-20 10:55:41 Like all the folding slower
help 2022-04-20 10:56:03 Then my aircraft carrier planes also taking off hella slow
help 2022-04-20 10:56:35 All my conveyor drive ships also acting up
help 2022-04-20 10:57:02 ^^ is the main issue
help 2022-04-20 10:57:24 Is that a new roblox update
help 2022-04-20 10:57:36 Cuz like 2 days ago it was perfectly fine

events-chat 2022-04-20 11:06:24 Is anyone's sub acting up recently
general 2022-06-03 05:22:10 did water mechanics break again
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 05:22:57 did water mechanics break..again
creations-chat 2022-06-03 07:24:54 exterior is a bit...lacking tbh
creations-chat 2022-06-03 07:26:57 ignore the holes i havent built the covers for the missile tubes
creations-chat 2022-06-03 07:29:42 i focused mainly on the mechanics so its exterior i didnt pay much attention. i did the interior cuz water is broken and i cant test it cuz its propulsion cant work in the new water
creations-chat 2022-06-03 07:34:28 it uses a conveyor drive capable of changing direction so it can turn without additional propellers, which can reach a top speed of 40+ underwater before the latest update

it can also carry 14 missiles in those holes on the top
creations-chat 2022-06-03 07:43:43 technically i can fit 16 missiles possibly 18 but thats kinda impractical and also the missiles are 3x3x7 so theres that...
creations-chat 2022-06-03 08:06:27 Maybe try dark grey
creations-chat 2022-07-23 13:23:50 me testing if ships can handle a boradside salvo from railguns
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:19:52 ty
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:26:11 I'm not exactly great at aesthetics. I focus more on the combat capabilities first before doing aesthetics
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:33:21 Welp. I don't pay much attention to aesthetics. I just try to cram as many weapons as I can into 1 build.

The sub was supposed to launch missiles underwater so it's gonna be hard to spot and destroy

It's basically a mobile missile base
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:35:45 Personally I don't like motor locking. Imo it's kinda unrealistic cuz u can't rlly do that irl.

And also it's a pain in the arse
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:38:41 I don't think u can motor lock 14 seperate guided missiles into 1 to save space sooo...

Each missile occupies a 3x6x3 space so the tubes are abt 5x9x5
I don't think motor locks will save any space or make anything better
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:47:00 Actually... Its at its max size already... Its in 4 sections... Its "flat" becuz the typhoon class subs I based it off is also kinda flat


Also we don't have in and out here

And mcdonalds is bussin anyway
creations-chat 2022-08-16 14:53:08 Welp it works and that's mainly what matters to me

And also macdonalds is like the main major fast food chain we have here along with KFC and burger King. And mcdonalds is better imo
creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:15:16 If the bridge(I assume u mean conning tower) is any taller it could poke out of the water in shallower areas which compromises its stealth

Yeah I could prob change length but I think its long enuff

Rudder can't be any taller due to fold

Flat is cuz of fold limits again

Detail is at the back of my list
creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:24:15 Actually  from the side it looks un-flat enough ^^
creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:42:27 Maybe its the angle and resolution of the pic

I tried to give it that base bulge bit maybe it wasn't very obvious
general 2022-10-08 16:37:48 Sadly
general 2022-10-08 16:38:03 It's almost winter when he said summer
general 2022-10-08 16:38:25 Now*
general 2022-10-08 16:42:35 BTW is it true Pc2 builds can be 4 times larger
creations-chat 2022-11-15 23:56:35 ?
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:09:29 maaan that ship would be a breeze to kill
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:15:57 why so little weapons
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:18:13 more weapons = more kills
and bigger deterrent
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:21:28 if u can make a ship that can provide a deterrent so strong that u get planes to piss off u deserve an award
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:54:50 who says u need conv drive
i never said anything abt using a conv drive
