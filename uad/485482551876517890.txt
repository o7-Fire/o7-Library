creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:56:56 how do i post images in creations
creations-chat 2022-08-16 03:59:01 i didn't see it calm down
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:56:44 anyone know how to fit variable sweep wings to a plane like a MiG-23 or an F-14?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:57:13 no like
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:57:32 how can you have a wing inside of a wing or 2 wings very close to the variable wing
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:57:57 ah, i’ll try that thanks
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:58:37 yeah but what about the motor that changes the sweep angle?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:59:27 motor 2s don’t let me change sweep angles well
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:59:39 even setting a max angle
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 15:59:43 they’re not
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:00:00 motor 2s work with the mouse unless it’s a servo
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:00:29 servo changes it back to the original sweep angle
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:01:03 yeah but what if i need multiple angles
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:01:17 like a variable sweep wing aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:01:21 such as a MiG-23
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 16:04:57 or a tomcat
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:36:20 <:BIG1:588443768806703124><:BIG2:588443778554134540>
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:36:45 <:BIG3:588443788721258534><:BIG4:588443798842114088>
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:39:12 it’s difficult to get a plane that won’t sink when in the water at regular gravity while being maneuverable enough to be called a plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:39:26 i’m referring to my He 51 B-2/H
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:40:23 it’s one i got from a tutorial but i modified it to be the sea plane variant
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:41:11 i only have 4 tutorial planes, the rest of mine aren’t from tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:41:30 like my big Me 264 that can carry a nuke
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:42:06 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:42:39 my attempt at an F-14 ended up looking like an F-35 without VTOL and with variable swept wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:43:23 nope
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:43:29 not even close
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:43:49 think of an F-35 with variable swept wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:44:35 i also tried to make an A2D-1 but it looks like a Wyvern with 10 guns instead of 4
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:46:01 it’s unstable with less sweep
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:46:24 it does barrel rolls but it loses all of its energy while doing so
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:46:51 i figured
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:47:05 but i still wanted to try
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:47:18 like i wanted to make a cannon but failed to make one with an auto loader
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:47:48 it is
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:48:44 as for my Me 264 with a nuke
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:49:16 imagine a 264 with 6 propellers instead of 4, bigger wings, no gunners, and a gigantic yellow bomb under it
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:50:12 looks more like a B-52 but with propeller engines instead of turbofans
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:50:21 and with 2 vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:50:40 mine is almost as big as one
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 17:51:16 alright i’m gonna go because my phone’s at 4%
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:17:02 you can make it so much simpler than that
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:34:27 with 2
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:35:03 1 motor for acceleration, 1 motor 2 for steering
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:35:22 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:35:59 okay
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:36:06 1 motor to speed your vehicle up
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:36:15 is that better?
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:36:38 where the wheel goes
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:36:41 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:36:47 on each wheel
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:37:10 maybe because you did it wrong
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:37:59 okay what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:38:07 that is way too complicated
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:38:19 i would understand a cannon with an auto loader
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:38:44 that can still be simplified
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:39:27 i created a P-38 that can run on just its propellers
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:39:42 still very complicated
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:40:15 to be honest you don’t need suspension
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:41:20 yeah that’s why you don’t need it
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:47:51 at least you’re honest
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:48:11 i once made an excessively large plane meant to drop a nuke
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:48:53 i had 12 4-propeller engines by the end of it
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:48:58 the wings were massive
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:49:20 and i wanted it to be very similar to a mix of the Me 264 and the Tu-95
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:49:48 i made my MiG-21 look like a MiG-21 with a motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:50:01 and here’s the best part
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:50:06 it has an ejection seat
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:50:31 but because of the ejection seat, i had to cut out part of the canopy
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:51:25 time consuming if anything
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:52:08 VTOL
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:52:27 that’s crazy
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:52:40 why isn’t it an F-35 that can actually VTOL?
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:52:58 oh true
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:53:37 i once tried to create a plane that had variable sweep wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 13:53:51 it turned out looking like a poor copy of the F-35
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:14:20 oh really? what sucks about that is that it actually isn't, look at the A2D-1, Wyvern S4, TBM 940, etc. notice how they all have a **propeller** and not a jet/turbojet/turbofan on it
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:16:43 as for the wings, how else am i supposed to get a 2 striped wing design over a 1x4 delta wing?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:18:47 over a 1x4 delta wing? how am i supposed to have 4 stripes on a single 1x4 delta wing?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:21:21 no because that's an air breathing jet
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:23:26 the main thing you see is the propeller, not the hot air it exhausts backwards

the engine isn't meant to look nice, it's meant to work properly which it does
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:25:55 probably because that's the only thing you know to use

and again, it's not just for looks
creations-chat 2022-09-16 03:28:25 i can make the wings better, but i ask again, how do i make wings with a striped pattern without breaking the build?
