creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:23:25 Dang I have created controversy
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:34:05 Alright I'd like to point out that, even though it's very small, I used a fair bit of motor lock. The details I used motor lock for include:
- the black trim going around the whole body
- the flag; double sided text with a piston locked trail
- the wheels
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:38:12 I will show the dang motor lock when I am home
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:41:58 I didn't expect the boat to get so many upvotes. The boat itself is a good build but I can see why some see it as unfair
