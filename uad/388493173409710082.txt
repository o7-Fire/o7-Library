bug-reports 2022-05-19 22:21:04 Noticed when after dropping my bomb from the plane, my plane starts spinning out of control and I have zero control over it. Only noticed this in private server so far
bug-reports 2022-05-19 22:26:33 Did this just start happening? Or have I just noticed it
bug-reports 2022-08-16 00:41:39 Helium seems to be broken. My entire zeppelin keeps getting lifted into the sky too quickly. Even though before when it had helium. It floated perfectly fine. Now it just seems like the helium is super strong for no reason.

general 2022-10-27 15:18:36 Probably because some people are in High School
general 2022-10-27 15:21:57 Polish wannabe Sten gun
general 2022-10-27 15:23:09 And then there’s the MP3008 💀
general 2022-10-27 15:24:08 Didn’t literally all the designs be copies of each other?
general 2022-10-27 15:24:46 Like, the British tried to copy the MP40, so they made the Sten, but the Germans wanted to copy the Sten gun, so they made the MP3008
general 2022-10-27 15:24:52 It’s ironic
general 2022-10-27 15:25:20 The design itself I mean
general 2022-10-27 15:25:42 It was an easy to use light sub machine gun
general 2022-10-27 15:26:16 MP40 with stock is extreme awkward to hold imo though
general 2022-10-27 15:26:26 Much better to hold it retracted
general 2022-10-27 15:27:52 Why do I need level 3 just to post images
general 2022-10-27 15:29:01 What
general 2022-10-27 15:29:50 I just need to keep talking so I can get a higher level ig

general 2022-10-27 15:32:24 Doesn’t everyone get to use a calculator?
general 2022-10-27 15:32:38 Bruh
general 2022-10-27 15:33:14 Sometimes it’s easier just to write it out
general 2022-10-27 15:33:19 At least for me

creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:37:40 the heck, why did a bunch of people unupvote my creation
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:41:23 Yeah, it was like at 140 upvotes before. And I came home and somehow its dipped to 79. Just wondering what would've made people do this and how I can improve
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:45:51 Ah yeah, it might be.
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:54:11 Yes, I do take that into account sometimes when building stuff in general. Makes it more unique and stands out from what people have already made a million times
creations-chat 2022-10-28 19:56:49 Very nice! I like how you did the curves for the hull and added portholes
general 2022-10-29 03:59:09 🤓
