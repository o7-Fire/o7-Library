general 2021-11-23 03:01:36 Yeah sure
general 2021-11-23 03:01:54 Although it's probably better to learn how to make one on your own
creations-chat 2021-11-24 10:00:18 oh
my bad
general 2021-11-24 10:08:24 What does your Dreadnaught look like
general 2021-11-24 10:08:43 autocorrect

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:19:45 how do you make motorlock go more than half block?
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:20:23 I meant smaller than half block
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:20:35 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:20:59 eh im probably worse
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:21:09 don't worry
creations-chat 2021-11-24 11:21:34 I think you should make it *slightly* more round

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:21:45 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 11:22:10 aight I'm gonna go continue attempting to build my SU 85

Also, good luck on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-24 14:12:17 I like how my frame rate literally shits itself the moment I move my conveyor

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 03:30:09 Unfortunately since i have skill issue it's using motor engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 03:31:05 are they supposed to be at the front too?
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 03:31:18 because I've never seen it like that

creations-chat 2021-12-01 07:15:11 I'm fairly certain it's for both grip and detail
creations-chat 2021-12-01 07:42:26 Don't really gotta be rude, I'm fairly certain they were just trying to help
creations-chat 2021-12-06 05:47:45 quality feedback
shitty builder approves
creations-chat 2021-12-07 02:33:56 Pretty good
creations-chat 2021-12-07 02:39:01 damn it's a hard choice
creations-chat 2021-12-07 05:10:19 Is that someone else's build?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:16:04 wondering if I should participate in it
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:16:43 but I am terrible at building stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:16:57 and my internet sucks <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-12-07 05:17:08 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:18:14 I remember seeing someone with a really good battlebot build a long time ago
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:18:24 pretty large
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:51 I don't have wifi
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:56 only mobile hotspot
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:58 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:34 should I go for strength or dexterity?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:11 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:21 4 blocks thick armour enough?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:48:29 now that I think about it the limit is large
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:48:41 12th December?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:31 ohh you mean that
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:44 My bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:17 The railway area is a good ring
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:26 the big oval area
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:32 yep
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:35 death.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:52:08 depends on what wheel though
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:52:28 If it's tall enough and your using motor powered wheels you should be fine
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:27 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:54 bigger bot means easier to hit though
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:08 So I don't think many would make it too big
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:20 cutter damage ability bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:58 good point
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:14 many of the bots have exposed wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:49 s w e e p  t h e  l e g
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:56 what does ballast tanks do again?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:45 imagine there's a underwater battlebot event
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:00 that would be both hell and fun
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:54 damn
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:03:07 <@622607246257422356> downvoting literally everything <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:04:01 next he's gonna start speedrunning downvoting literally every pcc build in existence <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:05:37 perhaps make a battlebot and submit in <#917397949938548736>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:06 I think as long as you don't use it to make motorlocked armour your good
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:42 I don't think it's allowed considering its layered armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:50 But I'm not fully sure
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:53 ask mods
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:02 not directly <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:16 yeah no pistons either
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:44 that one is scary
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:03 but it only got 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:18 tall?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:29 ohh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:06 hitting it is risky definitely
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:25 yup
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:46 attacking from the side is also hell considering it can turn VERY quickly
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:11:12 that definitely looks tough to take down
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:11:56 Was that what you used to take down the draggin?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:44 rip
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:13:29 Is there cameras?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:13:50 why does the thing look like it does <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:14:46 also I think you should put another layer of ladders
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:14:50 if you could
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:15:27 Good point
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:15:45 cover the wheels a bit more
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:15:54 if you want to
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:15 nah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:21 I don't know which is good and bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:43 all I know is that having large exposed wheels are bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:49 except draggin
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:18:47 Good luck man
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:19:59 That would be hard to flip people
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:20:52 most would probably use ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:21:37 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:01 If I was participating maybe 4 to 7
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:43 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:54 imagine that
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:08 literally fat
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:32 they can't fling you if your too fat
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:56 imagine the speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:24:23 I might test it out later if I feel like it
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:29:43 just have a battlebot with 20 blocks of armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:31:12 They never mention it, go ahead <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:31:35 suspensions aren't allowed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:31:45 wait lemme check springs
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:32:04 nothing about springs
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:32:18 aren't they *technically* considered suspensions?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:00:45 make them ban everything except normal 1x1x1 blocks, car wheels and cutters <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:05:04 most builds rely on a spinning cutter with no defense anywhere else
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:05:39 unless it's the Draggin
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:05:45 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:06:24 depends on what build it is
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:09:07 and 5 seconds later they're banned <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:10:36 imagine if it shits out blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:11:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:11:12 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:14 Not sure about the fighting location yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:32 yeah that works
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:12:54 only issue is that it doesn't stop moving unlike the car wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:13:01 and motor wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:13:19 unless you make the motor wheels to not lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:26:15 cover the wheel <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 08:34:25 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:40:43 time to make something to outrun the enemy
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:54:43 because they have skill issue <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 09:55:35 eh let it have multiple issues
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 11:50:08 snow wheel good
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 11:50:26 basically the cooler car wheel
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 11:52:07 technically you can make your battlebot heavy and impossible to move
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 11:52:24 but they said if your bot can't move/get flung out of the ring your out
general 2021-12-07 11:57:10 May I say something?
general 2021-12-07 11:57:46 your cutters uhhhh
general 2021-12-07 11:57:54 is 5 more than the limit
general 2021-12-07 11:58:01 just letting you know
general 2021-12-07 11:58:29 yeah it's 15
general 2021-12-07 11:58:42 and you have 20
general 2021-12-07 11:58:52 aight good luck
general 2021-12-07 12:03:04 wasn't there like a wedge that was similar to the cutter?
general 2021-12-07 12:03:30 I don't know
