plane-crazy 2019-10-10 03:12:52 ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2019-10-10 03:15:22 Does motor 2 just follow mouse?

help 2019-11-16 04:14:21 I can't tell if my hull is going well or not, this is my first ship build, any advice?
help 2019-11-16 04:19:10 I haven't decided yet, but I think 5-6 blocks would be a good range

help 2019-11-16 04:32:49 I dare you to build a car that is powered solely by magnets.
help 2019-11-17 04:38:34 I am facing the same issue with my boat
help 2019-11-17 04:46:52 It seems to only move when I get off the seat
help 2019-11-17 04:47:37 I removed all anchors to see if that was the issue but it did not work, all the inputs stop working until I hop out and hop back in
