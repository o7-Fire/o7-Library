general 2020-05-06 00:41:50 Check out my new creation.
general 2020-05-06 01:18:52 How is he going to make fancy signatures?
general 2020-05-06 02:24:15 Re phrase, I made a railgun that fuses all the explosive spheres in to one sphere, so whenever shot it makes one long lasting explosion*
general 2020-05-06 02:25:12 It's really complicated though it takes about 5-10 minutes to fuse all of the spheres into one with pressure. Then carefully move it into the barrel.
general 2020-05-06 02:25:50 Look it up on the internet
general 2020-05-06 02:25:53 Go on quora
general 2020-05-06 02:28:45 Random=funny
creations-chat 2020-05-06 03:18:26 Pretty sure pontoons was a summer limited-edition, if you want to make a roundish body without using Half cylinders, you can go for Wedges 2 -> and Look for Out-Wedge, the body of it is somewhat similar to round.
general 2020-05-06 03:47:01 Ok, for my giant blimp I'm looking forward to extending it to around 10k with a fold, and with crew rooms and 2 landing decks
