general 2021-04-18 08:48:27 but im no friends with someone named gale
general 2021-04-18 08:51:35 that car at the bottom of the screen looks familiar
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:33:44 rick broke motor 2's again
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:33:51 motor 2's are super weak on alot of my builds now
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:34:06 a tank i had that was using motor 2's for its suspension cant drive very good anymore
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:34:24 the motor 2's just collapse under the weight of it compared to staying up like it did before
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:41:25 of course it was roblox
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:41:36 constraints are pretty crap
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:44:52 yeah it seems roblox added a servo responsiveness option that kinda broke servo's
bug-reports 2021-04-20 22:44:57 hopefully they will fix that soon
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:33 the not colliding with terrain physics bug started happening to me too about 10 minutes ago
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:43 i reinstalled roblox twice thinking i messed something up with my roblox but nope
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:07:46 it kept happening
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:14:59 it seems that the not colliding with terrain bug only happens on the normal version of roblox
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:15:06 i tested on the app version and it doesnt happen
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:21:06 seems like it
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:29 the being unable to pick up event items bug has existed ever since the first winter event
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:35 i remember running into it
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:48:58 i dont think it did
bug-reports 2021-06-21 15:49:09 it just magically started working but now the bug is back
general 2021-06-25 11:58:44 why have i been pinged
general 2021-06-25 12:05:23 i am genuinely confused as to why rick pinged me but said nothing
general 2021-06-25 12:06:49 i dont have exploits
general 2021-06-25 12:11:27 no
general 2021-06-25 12:12:04 i have a feeling it might have to do with the rick impostor that tricked me yesterday
general 2021-06-25 12:12:17 one of my friends confirmed with rick that it was an impostor
general 2021-06-25 12:12:28 in a screenshot that included me so that might be why
general 2021-06-25 12:16:33 i never pinged rick
general 2021-06-25 12:29:13 i know why rick pinged me now
general 2021-06-25 12:29:20 he just joined my server then kicked me
general 2021-06-25 12:30:06 i definitely deserved it

bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:34:53 your physics went server side, judging by how your plane vanished for a second
bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:55:24 i dont even really know what causes it, it happens in my game (not allowed to mention) when one end of a motor falls into the void
bug-reports 2021-08-23 03:55:36 it does seem to be a roblox issue though
general 2021-08-23 04:28:53 nice ui

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:51:57 he would be mad about me even talking about this
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:03 you may think hes chill
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:05 he isnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:23 hes probably gonna delete these messages later and ban me from here
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:30 which will prove me
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:52:31 right
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:53:05 hes mainly salty cause i got tired of him taking so long to rewrite plane crazy so i made my own game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:53:16 any mentions of my game are banned here
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:54:18 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:54:23 i also added logic gates yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:55:18 other people can mention my game if they want to but im not gonna
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:55:34 im not gonna give rick a reason to false ban me
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:56:18 well ive already given rick a reason to false ban me cause i mentioned what he did
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:56:35 whole thing can be summed up in 3 sentences
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:56:47 he offered for me to work on plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:56:52 i denied cause i was fine with my own game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:56:56 he started begging
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:57:03 i started calling him out
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:57:07 he started denying
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:57:17 then
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:57:22 he started trying to delete evidence
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:57:31 alot of my messages here are deleted
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:03:50 wait

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:04:57 rick knows im not gonna just blip out of existence so he tries to actually stop people from mentioning the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:06:01 why do i feel like a revolution is about to happen

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:09:01 hell, ive already been false banned from the pcc for "advertising"
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:09:07 just because i mentioned the name of my game
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:09:23 i dunno how to use the bots
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:10:10 i wonder if astromakers is blacklisted
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:10:12 nope
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:10:34 specifically targetting vehicle creat≈èr

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:14:00 let them be mad
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:14:19 they are the ones who want to play this game

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:17:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:18:43 he doesnt want anyone playing it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:18:59 he would rather try to stop anyone from ever hearing about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:19:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:19:26 i barely talked about it at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:20:01 people still talk about the game every few days
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:24:38 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:37 infinite map is good but
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:39 the real question is
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 08:52:44 will it actually be good map?
general 2021-08-25 10:28:08 gonna join him using friend join and fry his motherboard with a server crasher <:trollface:775024642104229898> (not actually)
