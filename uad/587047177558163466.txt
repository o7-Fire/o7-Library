bug-reports 2020-08-19 19:25:46 So just found this out while messing around with my jetski:
If water propellors are about to hit air and you leave the seat, **the water propellor will still keep on moving throughout the air like its water, not slowing down at all, rather, it gets faster.**

The small test I did had two projectiles with water propellors, one that releases normally, and another that releases as you leave the seat. Through some testing, I found out that all of the water propellors can achieve this except for the 5x5 because it cant provide enough force to leave the water.

bug-reports 2020-10-05 00:59:48 **Slight dizzy warning in the video included.**

I believe I may have found another new bug regarding cameras.

So basically, if you kill a camera (can only be done via explosive blocks/balls, lava **sources**, not lava spitters, and world border) and try to get back into it, **your third person camera's position and orientation will lock in place and cannot be moved until you press the camera button again.** Asides from this, if you try to exit the seat while locked, the camera angle is teleported to where players load in initially. Again, if you can somehow manage to get back into the seat and press the camera button, it will go back to normal.

The test I performed included two lights, one assigned to the camera button to show when I activate it, and another light assigned to my right click. Once the explosive blows up and the camera is sent flying, it will stop after a while, which is when the camera officially "dies." Afterwards, once that has happened, the bug is shown to occur.

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 22:38:55 There isn't any ingame moderation, the most you can do is blacklist them and turn on Anti-Copy in settings

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 22:39:37 If you dont want them to copy you then its their fault for being blacklisted

bug-reports 2021-01-14 02:06:13 the only method i can think of would be to forcefully motor lock your way in
bug-reports 2021-01-14 02:07:57 like to access the button?
bug-reports 2021-01-14 02:08:12 if you destroy the button outside you destroy the button inside too

creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:14:45 heres ice material to show that the scale isnt wack
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:17:03 To be completely honest, the only reason I can come up with as to why that happens would be that the game in general became slower / more sluggish due to the fact that it had to load more reflections caused by the metal material

Otherwise, no clue + would like to see a flight demo of normal material heli as well
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:21:41 yeah the only thing I can think come up with would probably be because the game needs to load more stuff and so the game gets slower / in phantom forces if you put on certain materials on skins it causes the game to get slower, so I’m just inferring it off of that too

bug-reports 2021-01-14 02:42:33 use it some other games
bug-reports 2021-01-14 02:42:54 but how does that relate to getting into lab?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:43:05 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:44:19 I don’t see the point in glitching into it since there’s nothing to access
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:44:45 if you destroy the button on the outside it also destroys the button on the inside
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:45:04 unless there’s something im missing
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:45:52 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:46:19 when I mentioned breaking into it he said you could use the glitch
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:46:35 and get in by looking in?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:46:41 I must be likely
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:47:09 I must be like terribly misunderstanding something
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:47:29 because the glitch I’m thinking of is just to look through walls
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:47:39 not get through them
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:47:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 02:47:52 what

bug-reports 2021-01-21 02:16:47 its been a bug for a while now, the sparkler orientation resets when you load in a save slot with sparklers
bug-reports 2021-01-21 02:19:36 yeah if the rotor blades just like launch out like that
bug-reports 2021-01-21 02:19:52 its because the speed of the rotor is too fast and forces the blades outwards
bug-reports 2021-01-21 02:20:04 so yeah slowing them down is the way to fix that

bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:01:12 <@!217336009455566848> 
heres a little setup on recreating the jittering
Increasing motor speed drastically increases the jittering, and adding ballast beams and anchor blocks remove the jittering entirely for most of the tests i did
Angles 90 degrees or below tend to jitter but stop once it reached its goal - stops faster on slower speeds
Angles above 90 degrees keep jittering
Lower torque makes jittering appear less often

general 2021-02-02 22:30:57 gotta love it when this comes into my emails
general 2021-02-02 22:33:29 ah yes, i live here
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:34:33 i mean 1 / 19 / 21 was the day it broke
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:34:41 so i searched after 1 / 18 / 21
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:34:46 to see all the reports after it broke
general 2021-02-02 22:36:33 no context moment
general 2021-02-02 22:37:06 ik but still
general 2021-02-02 22:37:09 without the context
general 2021-02-02 22:37:20 it just makes everything confusing
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:37:40 *19th
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:37:58 i mean thats seems like when it broke broke
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:38:10 this is bug reports
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:38:30 np
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:41:14

bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:41:51 make sure to search both
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:41:56 and then theres servo
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:42:01 for the keywords
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:42:33 when i search `motor 2` i just disregard the `2` so i just search `motor`
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:43:43 only a handful are about an actual report tho
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:43:49 so it might not matter in the end
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:43:52 the
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:43:53 what
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:44:25 why are you doing that
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:44:28 just count each report
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:44:32 individually
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:44:37 look through them
bug-reports 2021-02-02 22:44:38 oh

~~alright, so, theres a handful of things that could be happening:~~
~~1) You aren't going fast enough, but I don't think thats the issue here~~
~~2) You aren't in pvp mode - could be possible, check~~
~~3) **You probably have anchor blocks in your build - if you have anchor blocks and you have cutters, the cutters are guaranteed not going to work.**~~

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:34:03 <@!530791063015784455> tbh if you want to make the thing roll, you're probably going to need to:

-make the seat heavier

help 2021-03-11 06:58:09 but when it goes down, the wing panels drag the entire back end behind
help 2021-03-11 06:58:15 and so it results in massive diving
help 2021-03-11 06:58:54 otherwise i have no clue
help 2021-03-11 07:00:28 yeah
help 2021-03-11 07:00:50 from what I see
help 2021-03-11 07:00:53 I mean
help 2021-03-11 07:01:12 the lift was smoothened out because of the wing panels
help 2021-03-11 07:01:25 but the descent was heavily affected by it
help 2021-03-11 07:02:10 you could try removing some wing panels in the back
help 2021-03-11 07:02:25 since it looked like you needed to do some adjusting while lifting
help 2021-03-11 07:02:58 don’t replace all of them
help 2021-03-11 07:03:09 unless you didn’t
help 2021-03-11 07:03:11 yeah
help 2021-03-11 07:03:17 try half
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 07:13:15 you need to ask for it to be removed

help 2021-03-19 08:40:01 if your plane pitches up insanely hard:
-increase the amount of wing panels in the back
-decrease the amount of wing panels in the front
-increase weight in the front
-decrease weight in the back

the plane is most likely pitching upwards due to having too much lift in the front, so these solutions should fix a large portion of the problem

help 2021-03-22 04:28:32 as for the treads, you did them spot on
pistons are fine for extending the wheels
help 2021-03-22 04:31:59 i mean the way i would do it would be to motorlock the wheels to the right, and then insert another wheel on the left from above
help 2021-03-22 04:32:22 theres probably a more efficient way of doing it but the way i do things are overcomplicated
help 2021-03-22 04:33:22 you're getting about 5 blocks of space which isn't the most helpful
help 2021-03-22 04:33:37 so unless you do something funky with pistons and motorlock on the wheels
help 2021-03-22 04:33:48 theres probably going to be an uneven gap between one of the wheels

general 2021-03-24 00:46:40 wasabi is sweet when it isn’t ground down

general 2021-03-24 00:47:39 from what I know
general 2021-03-24 00:48:06 there’s sugars in the original wasabi plant
general 2021-03-24 00:48:10 when it’s ground down
general 2021-03-24 00:48:23 it destroys those sugars
general 2021-03-24 00:48:34 And so it gets rid of the sweetness

general 2021-03-25 00:48:58 where
help 2021-03-25 00:49:30 so for single rotor helis
help 2021-03-25 00:49:43 its to counteract the torque made by the rotor
help 2021-03-25 00:49:47 so basically
help 2021-03-25 00:49:58 notice how if you have a single motor with props
help 2021-03-25 00:50:06 the motor/block beneath spins?
help 2021-03-25 00:50:19 the tail rotor is to make that not happen
help 2021-03-25 00:50:34 and make it spin the other way just enough where it doesnt rotate at all
help 2021-03-25 00:50:37 and then from there
help 2021-03-25 00:50:51 they can increase or decrease the angle of attack on the tail prop
help 2021-03-25 00:50:56 to make it turn left and right
help 2021-03-25 00:52:02 the wings on the tail rotor are probably draggin the heli

creations-chat 2021-03-29 03:19:23 <@!754238494083252224> to be completely honest, this community is pretty toxic, but theres a whole lot of experienced builders too

help 2021-03-29 03:27:01 ik whats the problem
help 2021-03-29 03:27:04 im typing it out hold on
help 2021-03-29 03:35:40 So basically:
Whenever your wings are folded out, the center of lift and center of mass are matched up pretty well like this
help 2021-03-29 03:36:10 But when your wings are folded in, the wings in general move entirely back, and so their lift moves back too, like this
help 2021-03-29 03:36:36 because it was so perfectly balanced earlier, the lift moving back causes it to, instead of going straight, to pitching down
help 2021-03-29 03:38:02 as for that, i dont have much an idea as to deal with it except for just compensating for it while flying
help 2021-03-29 03:38:15 but thats the problem you're dealing with
help 2021-03-29 03:40:37 i mean a stupidly complicated way to do it would be to put pistons with ballasts on them in the fuselage so that whenever you fold in your wings, the CoM goes back with it so it still balances out
help 2021-03-29 03:41:30 or vice versa with wing panels on the pistons - when the wings fold in, the pistons move forwards so that the lift is still in front
help 2021-03-29 03:41:54 but that'd be horribly inefficient and too hard to perfect
help 2021-03-29 03:42:01 so i dont recommend that

help 2021-03-29 04:43:50 <@!459749464434016266> tbh the reason why variable-swept wing aircraft were made were so that they could reach and maintain faster velocities
so increasing the speed when folding the wings in would most likely compensate for the stall speed

nasa made a 48 page document regarding stall on swept wings, so you could read up on that if you want

general 2021-04-02 02:31:47 tis called camera locking

general 2021-04-02 02:33:49 and then immediately click onto another block

the-dump 2021-04-02 02:34:27 real
general 2021-04-02 02:35:49 camera locking also makes it so that the cameras are locked in position in correlation with the main seat
general 2021-04-02 02:35:58 so camera locking cant be used on moving parts

unless its an outside source, then its okay from what i understand
help 2021-04-03 17:32:03 also if you're planning to make a large pixel art, you might as well color it in yourself
takes away from the challenge idea of the build <:empty:794431705070174238>

help 2021-04-03 20:26:40 oh
help 2021-04-03 20:28:55 yeah ig the definition for shredder bug has broadened a bit

Jimmy Carter is reported to be 1.77m tall while Joe Biden is 1.82m tall, but even if Carter had grown shorter in old age, the photo would suggest that Biden is taller than Carter by much more than five centimeters.

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 02:41:49 it sure does work though, so im going to assume that you didnt try to make a set before saying that

and what do you mean by vertical version <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 02:44:20 trapdoors, most likely
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 02:44:33 <@456226577798135808> right?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 02:45:28 the thin glass are trapdoors
general 2021-05-07 03:11:54 real
general 2021-05-07 03:13:39 
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:14:33 try it
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:15:26 what part of it isn't working?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:15:33 the motors are set on unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:15:41 and you have to fold in the trapdoors after spawning in
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:16:07 send a pic of it if you need
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:16:17 i wanna try to help
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:18:32 
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:18:34 yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:18:39 the trails are under the signs
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:18:43 the motors are under the trapdoors
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:19:19 
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:19:24 not locking into anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:19:28 just a thin track design
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:20:33 probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:20:59 might be better off with a standard one block thick track for those though
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 03:21:09 aight

2) what kind of treads: fake or actual treads?
and if you're going with actual treads, normal treads or thin treads?
help 2021-05-21 02:04:19 one block treads are normal treads

these treads are the thin variant
help 2021-05-21 02:05:46 thin treads can only go down to a minimum of two blocks wide
help 2021-05-21 02:07:59 you could go down to one block wide if you really wanted to, but it would be really clunky and probably wouldnt work well with the size of your sherman
so again a minimum of two blocks wide
help 2021-05-21 02:08:15 also
help 2021-05-21 02:10:03 the one block wide version isnt really one block wide, but its like 1.2 blocks wide
you'd need to use texts or signs, and from what i know there kinda isnt a one block wide tread that exists yet

<@456226577798135808> 
if anything, just always have a low self-esteem
either you're right or you'd be pleasantly surprised
having your own standards are good
but when you see that people aren't liking your build
you should try and maybe reaching out and asking what part of it they didn't like
so that you can further improve

help 2021-07-08 18:55:16 so basically if your plane keeps going down:

- Increase the amount of wing panels in the front
- Decrease the amount of wing panels in the back
- Increase weight in the back
- Decrease weight in the front

The plane is most likely pitching downwards due to having too much lift in the back, so these solutions should fix a large portion of the problem.

help 2021-07-26 02:44:22 so basically theres an option on pistons called Lock
if you enable it, the arm becomes completely rigid when its extended
so you can use it for motorlocked builds and the blocks stay in the extended position without spazzing out
big tip is to let the arm sit for a little bit before locking the build, otherwise theres a chance that the lock wont work
help 2021-07-26 02:47:42 think of it as motorlocking, except you're extending instead of retracting and you can finely adjust how much the block moves

creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:57:53 it acts as a normal angle lock
creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:59:56 yeah
when you're moving the motor2, the locked motor is freely moving bc of the 0 torque
but once you release the motor2, it angle locks
so basically you can angle it perfectly and it doesnt spaz out

im guessing you're referring to the shape of the pieces
but imo it doesnt seem like a spiral door
its just four pieces being clamped horizontally and vertically
creations-chat 2021-08-11 03:53:09 i guess
but it just still looks like its being clamped together

creations-chat 2021-08-11 08:17:38 was just admiring how one of the first few words were "pls up vote" and the bot decided to not add the upvote option 

if i were to say something about your build, i would probably say to either shorten/widen the creation
it seems abnormally long, and so the proportions dont feel right

basically just make it have proper proportions
creations-chat 2021-08-11 08:22:02 when it comes to creations, its definitely more based on results rather than efforts

creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:43:03 yeah plane crazy is pretty much the sandbox version more suited for just making vehicles
robocraft and besiege were pretty much the only reasons i came to plane crazy since they just seemed similar
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:46:21 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

honestly my first impression of plane crazy was "wow this is just a shitty version of besiege" and then just left 
came back to it a few months later and it wasnt as bad as i remembered
making wack stuff in besiege was fun
then modding got out of hand
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:49:35 besiege still has the upper hand in terms of blocks tbh
theyve got hinges and braces and freeform blocks now 
makes building so much easier but so much more in depth
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:52:18 now that i remember they added blocks for automation too
range-based detectors, height detectors, angle detectors, and just AND gates and OR gates and stuff

this is the freeform block
you can curve it and stuff so its hella useful for smooth surfaces

help 2021-08-28 03:33:24 there could be a handful of issues:
- a lack of lift towards the front of the plane
- an excess of lift towards the back of the plane
- too much weight towards the front of the plane
- ineffective control surfaces

to solve these, you could:
- add more wing panels towards the front of the plane
- remove weight in the front / add weight in the back
- use custom control surfaces

creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:23:23 hes just utilizing the suspension gyro thing
i think
forcefully bend suspension so it can spin crafts fast if done right

if im reading this right, it says
"[x=3, y=4, z=10] Turned into [x=3, y=3, z=6]"
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:29:55 he's minimizing it, according to the caption above it
~~if you kinda just vaguely look at the image, the mechanism itself is also kinda getting smaller so the numbers are probably getting smaller~~

wait wait

yeah might be closer to 8, but i still think its 6
using the green blob as a guide, the green takes up like 1/10 of the length, if not a little bit more
and then in the second pic, the entire thing basically shrinks to half its original size
so theres probably a bit of space for guessing
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:35:34 >makes a thing
>makes basically an entire guide, if not tutorial on how its constructed and its before and after
>blurs the entire thing so they cant see it
>"i made thing, look"
creations-chat 2021-09-22 03:58:36 for people that dwell in pvp servers:

on a scale of 1-10, how annoying is this if you were to encounter it
creations-chat 2021-09-22 04:07:05 according to the responses that ive been shown, this may mean that i have created an abomination
creations-chat 2021-09-22 04:09:29 its only 5 blocks for one of those things so yeah its pretty weak
could probably go down to 3 blocks minimum
creations-chat 2021-09-22 04:11:49 6 blocks <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:31:42 people that invented

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:35:33 the
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:35:52 you can still get inventor?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:36:40 the
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:37:08 when update
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:34 i could get inventor for at least 3 of my creations
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:38:36 i think
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:39:25 mecanum wheels and omniwheels + their respective drivetrains, ornithopters
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:39:27 among other things
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:39:33 not sure if they would count
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:40:05 yeah that part im sketchy about
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:40:17 but as far as i know im the first one to recreate a mecanum wheel in pcc

stuff like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:42:49 everything has to constructed with something

if you say that, then people cant get credit for designing things and all of it would go to rickje and mad since they're the ones that implemented motors and stuff into the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:44:41 iirc a guy named blackbird got inventor for making a wave machine or a rowing mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:44:45 cant remember which one he got it for
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:44:56 but he still got the role regardless

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:46:16 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:46:23 there are always things that can be made
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:46:34 just a matter of whether or not someone has discovered it or not
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:46:48 making actual game functions that can be used is the key cencept
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 04:47:08 like how brickzay implemented fine tuning block placement with suspension and ropes

plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:48:00 if you want to lock on command you'd have to use disconnectors/explosives so they prevent the lock from contracting
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:48:08 explosives are used in private servers and private servers only
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:48:17 otherwise they'd destroy the creation in public servers
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:48:21 yep
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:48:26 disconnectors or springs
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 01:55:40 perhap

so just wanted to not look too out of place
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:06:00 a few way to do them
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:06:01 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:06:09 for disconnectors:
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:06:11 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:06:13 
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:08:20 you could also do this

pointing the red towards the middle makes them drop and fall out
otherwise they stay connected
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:09:30 you could also set the blast radius to 0
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 02:15:21 default would work

plane-crazy 2021-10-11 05:55:53 from what i know
roblox terrain is fard and is laggy
so they're using 3d models for the new maps so it isnt as laggy

just a general tip for photos

if you go to the plane crazy settings, there should be something called Photo Mode
assign two keys and press them together to get rid of the gui
should make photos a tiny bit cleaner

plane-crazy 2021-10-28 03:17:40 i finally figured out what the hell legacy does on rockets

Fundamentally, rockets get faster in velocity as the rocket launcher-thing itself gets faster

In the non-Legacy version of rockets, only forwards motion is converted into rocket velocity
Whereas Legacy rockets can travel in any direction and still have their velocity increased

Basically, if a Legacy rocket and non-Legacy rocket were to fired while a vehicle is moving forwards, they travel at the same speed
But if the vehicle were to be traveling sideways/backwards/up/down, the Legacy rockets would be faster
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 03:22:31 tracking stays the same i think
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 03:22:39 only the velocity calculation is different

figured out what legacy actually does
copy and pasted what i posted a few days ago

Fundamentally, rockets get faster in velocity as the rocket launcher-thing itself gets faster

In the non-Legacy version of rockets, only forwards motion is converted into rocket velocity
Whereas Legacy rockets can travel in any direction and still have their velocity increased

Basically, if a Legacy rocket and non-Legacy rocket were to be fired while a vehicle is moving forwards, they travel at the same speed
But if the vehicle were to be traveling sideways/backwards/up/down, the Legacy rockets would be faster
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 21:56:51 not too sure about damage but i doubt theres a difference asides from that
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 21:57:07 legacy would be better
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 21:57:18 nonlegacy is just more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 22:00:54 pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 22:01:02 if those pvp jets dont drift and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 22:01:16 otherwise legacy is pretty much superior
plane-crazy 2021-10-31 22:01:21 in terms of getting them faster

creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:15:07 are the motor2's on mouse control?
or rather what settings do they have
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:26:02 theres still no way that thing doesnt flip over, let alone hover
theres drag on one end and there lift on another, so it'd just rapid flip around where the delta wings would be
angling the motor2s in a way where the thing wouldnt make it spin wouldnt make it even lift at all
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:30:27 are you telling me that it doesnt actually fly
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:36:37 pictures dont help when it comes into seeing that something is flying __under control__

i could give you this photo and say its flying
meanwhile its actually plummeting to its death because it doesnt have any actual wings 

also on that note, your craft is going a considerable 60 sps in one of the photos
which means that you had to have taken it when it was midflight, not even in hovering
creations-chat 2021-11-03 04:39:52 what im saying is that a video would be preferred

help 2021-11-09 22:39:08 piston lock basically locks the piston head in place if you let it sit for some time after extending the head, letting you motor lock it into stuff and not screw over

really good for small adjustments, since it isnt restricted to only a certain amount, like how locked motors can only move half a block

can be used to make blocks run flush with others after anglelocking, or just making blocks go flush in general

otherwise its pretty good for mechanisms that require fine tuning too

help 2021-11-25 09:54:52 if you can you should

creations-chat 2021-11-25 16:07:19 vigorous amounts of trolling
help 2021-11-25 16:12:01 as a result of the rear wing panels + tail rotor, theres a lot of drag in the back
thats why at 0:13, when the rear wing panels were pointing up, it flew a bit smoother
at least vertically it did

increasing weight in the front isnt going to be much help
think about weight once it can take off and you're trying to level it when you're moving forwards/backwards

to fix it, you should switch out the tail rotor propellor blades to control surfaces 
and then either:
- decrease the amount of wing panels in the back
- add additional wing panels towards the front
- just point the wing panels in the back completely up before you take off / move vertically

the wing panels in the back are going to help once you get forwards/backwards/sideways movement
but for now, they're causing the whole thing to capsize

another reason to switch out the tail rotor propellor blades to control surfaces is so that it doesnt rotate the body when flying up and down
im pretty sure thats the reason why the whole thing started to roll over at 0:13, when the craft was moving forwards
if you had control surfaces, there wouldnt be any forces like that on the heli so it should become stable
help 2021-11-25 17:17:41 are the control surfaces set to keybinds instead of "Set Controls Automatically"?
help 2021-11-25 17:17:54 i think they arent
help 2021-11-25 17:18:01 since the camera locked in the beginning
help 2021-11-25 17:18:10 usually that happens with control surfaces with default settings
help 2021-11-25 17:19:40 so that means the "Set Controls Automatically" setting is on?
help 2021-11-25 17:19:55 oh
help 2021-11-25 17:20:11 so keybinds are set to left and right keys?
help 2021-11-25 17:20:15 or whatever you're using
help 2021-11-25 17:21:48 thats just an issue with roblox's chat filter
help 2021-11-25 17:25:13 now that i think about it, you might want to have the tail rotor set to toggle and set it to a key that you just press once
and then keep the keybinds for the control surfaces

if you kept the tail rotor settings the same as before with the propellor blades, then it might be messing it up

otherwise, the control surfaces just might lack power
help 2021-11-25 17:26:14 also
help 2021-11-25 17:26:14 wait
help 2021-11-25 17:26:28 you should only use the tail rotor for turning when you're hovering
help 2021-11-25 17:26:44 or else you're gonna run into the same issue of rolling over as you were with the propellor blades
help 2021-11-25 17:26:58 and then maybe add a vertical stab in the back for turning forwards
help 2021-11-25 17:27:32 there might be a way to bypass it
but i havent really messed around with emojies that much
help 2021-11-25 17:27:38 so i cant really give insight
general 2021-11-25 17:28:26 frong
help 2021-11-25 17:30:22 just turn on the toggle setting on the motor
press a key once and itll keep spinning

so that people that judge on looks cant judge it that hard <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
help 2021-11-25 17:49:56 okay just noticed a couple of things:

for the main rotor, doing the 40 speed on the top motor and 20 speed on bottom motor works, but you shouldnt do that
make it so the top motor is 50 speed and the bottom motor is unpowered
that way it both counters the torque and distributes the power evenly

second note
you shouldnt set the same keybinds for both the forwards and backwards
or else you wont able to stop it and its going to be finnicky trying to get it to spin the way you want it 
just set the keybind you want to either forwards or backwards
and then a key you'll never use to the other

lastly
if you want to turn with the tail rotor, you're gonna need to put keybinds on there
not sure if leaving it empty like that was intentional or not
but just noting it here in case

bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:00 found a funny bug regarding the water propellor

if you have either a **water propellor 2x3 or 2x5** (the two water propellors that dont have casings and are decently large) directly attached to a **locked** piston, anything thats attached to the water propellor will spin around it
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:13 im 110% sure that this is useful for something, cant immediately think of anything
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:27:24 was able to put it on a stand
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:42:12 doesnt have a whole lot of torque
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:51:05 putting at least 9 propellor blades on the thing without anything else makes it go light speed
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:51:27 but then 90% of the time crashes roblox
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:52:04 not even sure if the propellor blades are what make it go fast
might be just related to the physics that comes with it
bug-reports 2022-01-01 23:53:19 attaching unpowered motors to the thing is a bit finnicky
works half of the time, doesnt most
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:09:46 what the fuck
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:10:04 i dont think the 2x5 has a weight limit at all at this rate
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:13:08 <@456226577798135808>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:22:11 i take that back, the 2x3 doesnt have one either
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:35:35 all 2000 ballast beams set to 40 density and the thing doesnt have the slightest intention of slowing down
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:36:17 this thing doesnt have a weight limit
bug-reports 2022-01-02 00:41:04 original post to whoever is seeing this now
bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:32:59 no one is reading my post about how it breaks with propellors <:nooo:787097964946259978>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:33:01 wait
bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:33:02 idea

bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:34:37 <@!798957190399524865> 
this is what i was talking about
bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:57:31 yeah its always been like that
bug-reports 2022-01-02 01:57:43 but for some apparent reason the locked piston kinda enhances it
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:01:36 yeah
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:01:46 unless you have enough propellor blades
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:02:17 at which point it just warps into the void and has a good chance of crashing your game
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:15:05 you can upload a txt file and open it that way
i dont think txt files have a text limit
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:22:16 it doesnt work directly
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:22:27 trying to figure out a way so that it can be used that way atm

bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:25:58 trying to get the other gear done rn

bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:26:33 used it in another build before
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:54:56 okay so it kinda not so really works
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:55:59 wdym
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:00 just like
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:06 put propellors on the thing?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:56:26 right
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:57:00 this is what i found pretty early on
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:57:59 hold on
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:58:11 ill just make it and post a video so people actually get the memo that it kinda break
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:58:12 s
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:59:39 yeah that works too but with the locked piston it works even better
bug-reports 2022-01-02 02:59:44 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:09 i mean
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:12 okay first thing
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:13 wait
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:14 wait
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:16 i found that
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:25 if you have 2 or more on a single craft
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:30 only one works
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:37 basically it spins around only one propellor
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:44 <@!251880826386513924> so reaction wheels wont really work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:00:55 not sure
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:01:04 maybe the one that locks faster by a few milliseconds
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:01:15 because they're on the same keybind
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:02:11 probably
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:03:07 the other water propellor bug i found like half a year ago is way more useful
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:03:39 no one really saw it and no one really considered it <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:04:25 made plane crazy's first water propellor powered plane <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:04:57 the one i just linked?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:03 it takes a bit of preparation
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:08 because you need to get into water
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:15 and then jump out of the seat before you get out of the water
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:19 then you reach hyperspeed
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:36 oh?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:05:58 also heres the thing with propellors so people can actually understand that it kinda doesnt work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:06:31 then it doesnt move at all
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:06:56 does it?
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:00 thats the one i didnt try
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:05 because its evenly spaced
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:23 yeah id guess it work
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:28 since it matches the criteria
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:07:35 non cased, semi-large
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:09 yeah its either it doesnt work at all or breaks the craft
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:12 there is no in between
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:10:17 at least from what ive found with it so far
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:11:18 im pretty sure the reason why stand-alone water propellors work is because it wants to spin, but the hitbox extends out where it tries the spin the block its attached to
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:11:54 still not sure why the locked piston happens tho
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:12:52 yeah just figured that out
bug-reports 2022-01-02 03:12:56 warps through the shaft

bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:38:57 <@!406887792015048715> 
basically in both of your issues, you need to remember that weld points are stupid
disconnectors still connect to blocks on all 6 sides
the only weld point that can detaches from the disconnector is on the side that has the smaller end of the disconnector

disconnecting side is labeled green in the video
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:01 in the third video, the issue was that the disconnector was connecting both the booster and the main craft together via the half block above and below it
so basically you just needed to flip around the disconnector and it would work
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:20 meanwhile in the first video you posted, the trapdoor was connected to the disconnector above it
the weld point on the trapdoor is on three edges, labeled green in the video
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:39:27 basically, the trapdoor was connected on the non-disconnecting side of the disconnector above it 
if you wanted to keep it as a trapdoor, you just need to flip the trapdoor so that it connects to the booster, and not to the disconnector
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:43:36 in the second video, basically the same thing, except that it was connected to a half block
half blocks still have weld points on all sides except for the one thats obviously missing
bug-reports 2022-01-15 21:44:06 tl;dr

weld points are stupid
even if it isnt visually connecting, theres a good chance that it is connecting
bug-reports 2022-01-15 22:40:16 they're just stupid in the sense that people that try to make stuff visually need to work around them if they want to add a little bit of stuff in like how he did it with disconnectors

otherwise yeah weld points are damn good if used properly

bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:44:58 ah mb
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:45:38 what happens if you:
1) got into the camera
2) get out of the camera
3) press f
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:46:07 aight
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:06 this is just gonna take a lot of experimentation as to what exactly makes it kill itself
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:13 the blocks are getting destroyed somehow
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:20 since they're decaying
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:51:40 and the camera block itself is breaking in the midst of that
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:52:04 if you destroy a camera and/or get out of the seat whilst in a camera, the viewpoint orbits around the camera block as if it were the player
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:52:37 aight
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:53:15 what happens if you 
1) get in camera
2) get out
3) get in
4) press f
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:55:28 weird
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:55:35 so it doesnt kill itself?
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:42 <@456226577798135808> what are the settings on your explosives
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:51 yeah ofc it wouldnt die in nonpvp
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:56:56 the blocks themselves are getting destroyed
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:57:12 try setting them all to Ignore Self
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:58:13 it doesnt die?
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:58:50 im assuming your Impact speed is like 5 or something extra low
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:19 oh
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:20 hmmrg
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:22 well either way
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:33 pressing the camera causes something to move and thus come into contact with the explosives
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:38 is what i think is happening
bug-reports 2022-01-18 00:59:58 because Ignore Self causes it to not explode upon contact with your own creation

neat concept, but you did the stupid mistake of making the power come from the string

crossbows, as well as bows, have their power generated by the limbs of the device, not the string
creations-chat 2022-02-10 05:28:05 wack

<@!273536574770380800> has a pretty neat bow design that gets its power from the limbs
you could maybe try basing it off of that
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 23:42:14 Fundamentally, rockets get faster in velocity as the rocket launcher-thing itself gets faster

In the non-Legacy version of rockets, only forwards motion is converted into rocket velocity
Whereas Legacy rockets can travel in any direction and still have their velocity increased

Basically, if a Legacy rocket and non-Legacy rocket were to be fired while a vehicle is moving forwards, they travel at the same speed
But if the vehicle were to be traveling sideways/backwards/up/down, the Legacy rockets would be faster

general 2022-02-23 05:55:46 <@!715148402022678608> yeah that would be safe

general 2022-02-23 05:57:36 what about a mortar with an aiming system
general 2022-02-23 05:57:44 i really wanna try making one of those
general 2022-02-23 05:58:56 if you're talking about texts then those are like heavily used
general 2022-02-23 06:00:01 imo i use texts because they're just connection points without hitboxes
general 2022-02-23 06:00:05 good for mechanical stuff
general 2022-02-23 06:00:23 whereas i cant really use cameras since they're pretty much just cosmetics
general 2022-02-23 06:00:31 they're invisible but you still hit them
general 2022-02-23 06:02:27 i think i used up nearly all of my text 1x3s in this
general 2022-02-23 06:02:53 not for that singular wheel tho
general 2022-02-23 06:02:57 the entire drive
general 2022-02-23 06:03:26 texts are better suited for when stuff is moving
general 2022-02-23 06:03:34 if things are just static then cameras are better
general 2022-02-23 06:03:47 
general 2022-02-23 06:05:14 if it doesnt move then cameras most of the time
general 2022-02-23 06:05:29 if it has to connect in a weird way then texts

actually might use this later for myself, ty for the prompt

hopefully the trails on attached to the blades hide once you have all of them on
also works with all 4 blades on the 0.9 block

from the looks of things you have like 20 blades, with 5 sets of 4 blades
so you can have one set thats solid, and the four others with the configuration that i posted, with the angles set at 18, 36, 54, and 72

or you could make 5 sets with angles set at 18, 36, 54, 72, and 90

bug-reports 2022-03-28 04:57:35 yeah he replied to our thread when i first found it
sci was the one that actually made that specific setup tho
bug-reports 2022-03-28 05:00:32 unfortunately the mechanics of it are a bit wack
although it can spin up heavy things as if they werent there, it barely has any torque
so instead of it sending things into space, either it goes flying itself or it just stays still

you can read up more if you want starting here:

creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:32:18 ignore that im not hars
i feel like the leg proportion is a bit different than on the model, but im not sure if you're able to change that
so either the lower portion of the leg needs to be longer or the upper portion needs to be shorter
you also might be able to add like the little heel portion of the leg thats contacting the ground
but now that i look closer you're using cutters for the toe so not sure
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:37:46 oh so wait its an original feldreß?

ofc taking inspiration from others but
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:43:31 ah alr
thought it was based off of the vanagandr so i had like the idea of it being this intense tank of metal, so the legs just didnt feel right
now that you point it out the body does resemble the lowe's one
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:48:24 might be

creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:07:07 maybe try adding a bit more variation in color
i can see that you're using wood material for the stock and stuff but still doesnt really feel the same
so like try maybe adding a bit of weathering using color on top of the material
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:08:54 idk its just that compared to the reference photo, yours just looks too plasticky and clean

water wheels can act as gears, but transmissions would be a bit tricky since they only come in one size
creations-chat 2022-04-21 07:16:55 on one hand the opportunity rover itself was dear to people, so i guess thats why people upvoted it
but from a standpoint that just sees creations for their actual worth, the rover itself isnt that good in quality
similar to creations based around holidays, some people make creations around them to get upvotes while others do it just because its that holiday
kind of a mess but pcc 💀

bug-reports 2022-06-21 03:01:38 im like 90% sure thats only happening because of that specific setup

physics anchor blocks directly on the plot tend to bug out, and so they somehow provide a torque that goes throughout whatevers attached on them

so if you lifted that entire setup up a block, that wouldnt happen

the-dump 2022-06-21 04:15:35 ```guidelines to making a creation that doesnt get killed in #creations
```
• making something that has like 5+ results in <#384025409945337856> is not a good idea
   - disregard if you're confident that your build outclasses them entirely

• have a good color scheme
   - nothing cancerously vibrant and out of place
   - ask in <#384021699466756107> or <#478584971670454284> or <#504436696021204992> if you're not really sure
   - if its based on something, you should try making it close to it as you can to that
   - optional if your creation is mechanical

• irl stuff should be avoided, but
   - disregard if you're good at building, otherwise people that are critical will downvote at the slightest fucking detail
   - not a bad idea if you're able to tolerate a little stabbing and want to get better at building 

• custom stuff is okay, but
   - kinda hard to judge since theres nothing really to compare it to
      • also a good thing, cant get pestered over really small details
   - doesnt mean that you can make it cringe

• mechanical stuff is cool, but 
   - if replicating something from irl, make it as similar as possible instead of something that just "looks like it"
      • if you can't, making your own solution is the next best thing

• pixel art is good most of the time
   - anime and other cringe topics should be avoided
      • minecraft is counted most of the time since its overdone
   - size matters (kinda)

• memey stuff is good, but
   - nothing thats stale + overdone + cringe

• good looking builds that are mechanical are * *chefs kiss* *

• otherwise, just see what gets murdered in <#384025409945337856> and dont do what they did

• if you make a tutorial build and call it your own you're fucking stupid
   - they will find you

or just not to have a lot of torque in general on the motors

help 2022-07-07 00:25:42 cyclocopters without a syncing mechanism is viable only for short amounts of time
help 2022-07-07 00:26:32 the reason you’re encountering instability is because the wing panels that are tilting within the system are moving more/less than they should, and they cause the motion to become a bit jittery
help 2022-07-07 00:26:54 yeah seeing how there’s only one motor attached to the wing panel there’s no syncing
help 2022-07-07 00:27:33 you’ll need another subset of motors that keep all the motors at the same rotated position
help 2022-07-07 00:27:52 but the problem i found with my cyclocopters is that then the entire set gets out of sync
help 2022-07-07 00:27:59 and stops working after a while

help 2022-07-28 04:27:46 most of the wing panels are located at the back of the plane and thats what makes the blue dot so far back
meanwhile the yellow dot sits in the middle of the plane since there isnt much of a difference in the front than in the front

if you want to match the blue dot to the yellow dot, then you could maybe try adding ballast blocks to the back of the plane and increasing its weight so the yellow dot is closer to the blue dot

otherwise, you cant really move the blue dot unless you move the entire wing itself, or make it bigger, which im assuming you wouldnt want to do since that'd mess up the look of your plane
help 2022-07-28 04:33:41 hes just asking how to move the blue/yellow dot

bug-reports 2022-07-30 03:12:10 powered locked motors have a tendency to "relock" if spun at high speeds, albeit being inconsistent with the length of contraction and position relative to the base of the motor
the faster the rotation, the more likely and drastic the outcome will be
the moving portion of the motor (whichever end that isnt attached to the spinning part) tends to move towards the center of the rotation, and so orientation of the locked motor doesnt really affect the bug
the settings for the locked motors dont matter either, having it set to 0 speed and/or torque doesnt affect it
sometimes the motors do "relock" outwards from rotation, but more often than not they move inwards

probably just locked motors being funny again

help 2022-07-30 06:50:31 seems like there’s too much weight towards the front of your creation

by adding helium to the front, you’re pretty much alleviating the weight, so if you can somehow either take away some blocks from the front or add more to the back, there’s a good chance that it’ll be able to lift off the ground without the need for helium
help 2022-07-30 06:51:45 you could try adding ballast blocks to the back of your plane and slowly increase its weight until it’s right

plane-crazy 2022-09-21 19:45:28 this entire set of wedges is all interconnected
and the white wedges are facing the wrong way
they should be on the outer edge and rotated the so flat side is facing down and to the motor

contest-chat 2022-09-21 19:47:54 midterm moment
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 20:51:46 its probably because you have the wedges on the front and back facing the same way
the pointy edge should be facing downwards in the front and stay the same in the back as downwards
also make sure that the wedge is on the outer edge, so like it isnt touching three motors at once
plane-crazy 2022-09-21 20:52:47 the ones in the front should be upside down

regarding the rotation of the individual rollers, you should try to use locked powered motors instead of motor 2s to rotate them the proper orientation
sure it isnt as easy, but in the long run it'll be a lot more stable since they wont misalign
otherwise you can try to use a combination of both motor2 and locked powered motors but imo just having locked powered motors is a simpler solution
