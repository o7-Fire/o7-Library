plane-crazy 2021-08-06 22:59:02 ok

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:41:55 at least i dont use shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:42:21 they are really easy to shoot down with turrets tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:42:33 since they break easily
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:42:37 but they are fast af
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:43:14 i hate people who just drive into ur build and explode

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:16:32 anyone have a dababy car
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:17:40 use cylinder for wheel, motor to turn wheel, rocket engines for sped, suspension for sus- i mean comfort, tiny propellers to turn
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:17:50 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:30:11 i do tuts and customize em for fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:30:28 and i use the build techniques i gathered
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:30:33 and make some builds of my own
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 16:31:35 also it has made me 10 times faster at building since i have to place the part quickly so thats a plus
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:18:37 guys why is my rocket engine laughing ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:29:18 lol theres 2 nine year olds who are targetting me, one has a shredder ball and another has a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 18:29:30 how do i defend against this
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 20:01:55 pvp servers are so toxic
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 20:02:26 i just wanna test my weapons in peace  üò¶
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 22:57:19 high speed + springs = bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:38:37 lol someone reported me for testing with springs
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:38:38 seems legit
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 23:50:22 i was testing using rockets on them and seeing how to make em expand, and someone just came to my  plot and said 'reported'

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:47:13 unpopular opinion, stop screaming so much about shredders
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:47:21 rather than crying about them like little babies find ways to counter them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:47:23 they arent unkillable
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:47:31 5 business years
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:48:16 what is
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:48:25 No?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:48:44 also nothing is indestructable
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:48:57 how?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:49:01 you can destroy anything lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:49:13 tnt armor can be met with firework launchers
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:49:20 any build can do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:49:25 its just lag pretty sure
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:50:00 so then
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:50:02 if thats true
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:50:07 every jet is indestructable
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:50:13 because they are agile and sometimes become invisible
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:51:21 also then if that happens just server hop
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:51:31 insetad of crying
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:51:38 ive never seen a shredder leave
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:51:42 because of someone insulting them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:51:44 and screaming at them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:52:26 when did i say you cry
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:52:52 yea but theres easy ways to counter them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:53:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp2ppsh3P6s&t=63s
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:53:27 yea but thats a game issue
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:53:52 whatever
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:04 i think shredders are hated because of the community
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:07 i mean dont get me wrong
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:09 i dont like them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:13 i think they require
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:14 no skill
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:19 but also you can counter them
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:20 unless
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:23 if they are using the bug
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:26 as you said
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:29 but then just server hop
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:54:54 of course the average shredder army user is 8 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:55:34 he also destroys shredder balls
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 18:55:41 server hop

plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:17:16 when it goes on the tracks you can see there is no suspension
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:17:42 doesnt matter if there is
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:17:45 it obviously doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:20:33 in the video it seems like the suspension is so weak that the wheels touch the hull
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:21:20 turn the free length up
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:21:23 then send screenshot of it spawned in
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:21:26 like set it to 6
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:34:52 your tank is too back heavy, either add ballast blocks or change stiffness
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:36:35 the front should be lowet
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:36:37 lowest
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:36:45 middle should be like a little more stiff than front
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 06:36:51 back should be most stiff

plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:53:17 u dont need a phobi]
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:53:18 phobia
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:53:48 a phobia is an irrational fear of something
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:54:03 finding holes in faces with stuff inside them disgusting is not irrational
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:54:21 well yea if u feel that thats a phobia
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:54:54 no like
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:54:56 if u feel those feelings
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:54:59 u prob have a phobia
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:55:02 but if u just feel disgusted
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:55:04 then thats normal

plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:57:43 i figured that out from experience
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:57:53 just think about what you are doing right now and how you can make the most of life
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:58:13 death is natural
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:58:57 i dont think it was a phobia i was just thinking of how it would be to die and then i was depressed for a few months
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:59:07 im not AS depressed anymore but lets be honest we're all depressed
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:59:41 i dont believe in the afterlife at all
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 05:59:54 i think its kinda nonsense to believe in it, no offense to the religious people
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 06:00:04 we all hope afterlife exists

plane-crazy 2022-06-25 06:07:44 elon musk is planning a renewable rocket

creations-chat 2022-06-26 05:43:54 no but like that isnt hard to think off, that logic would usually apply, but not for that build.
help 2022-06-26 06:01:24 <@927145074867978240> try using motorlock to fill the gaps, floating guns look weird. also put the rockets inside the turret, or dont
creations-chat 2022-06-26 06:03:30 <@927145074867978240> try motorlocking the turret down so its lower down, it looks kinda funky so raised from the hull. also it would look better if the rockets were inside the turret, and the floating guns look weird, either put them inside the turret or motorlock them so that guns fill the gaps, kinda like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ye8UeUYYZc

general 2022-06-26 06:18:09 bruh
general 2022-06-26 06:18:16 no imbed sad
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:28:27 can you make a toggleable motor lock by putting an anchor on the main part of the build and on top of the motor lock tower?
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:32:20 why not anchor?
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:32:35 springs and disconnectors cause lag and they might get stuck in build
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:33:53 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 16:33:57 thats annoying
creations-chat 2022-06-26 16:58:30 88 upvotes
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:13:37 bro u still arguing with me about that being good? ong. shut the fuck up please lord have mercy
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:19:10 i made it in 7 minutes dude, its literally just a simple angle lock, and apparently standards are so fucked that it gets 88 upvotes
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:21:43 make a jet that isnt fucking perfect, or has one exposed motorlock, and get 88 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:29:02 yes use my ass troll builds as a point
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:31:52 lmao i love how u people bring builds up from a goddamn year ago as a point in this argument, which isnt even relevant at all

prob the third or fourth time, cause you idiots cant admit that you are wrong, so you decide to bring my builds from a year ago up. literally braindead beings
creations-chat 2022-06-26 17:35:47 thats what im sayin bro

<@685909594932773033> agreed, maybe if that person is new to the game is isnt low effort, but yea

creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:38:54 <@591424008327659520> in the reference picture, the first section of the arm is bent backwards, so why didnt you do that for your build? it looks very funky and unbalanced the way you have it
creations-chat 2022-07-15 03:26:38 hide it

creations-chat 2022-12-04 07:06:52 pretty good, could use some detail and color tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 22:22:15 smhsmh
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:21:42 some idiot is saying cobras are possible in this game, which they arent, because the games physics engine isnt realistic enough to allow that, so am i right or wrong?
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:26:15 they arent
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:26:19 not in the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:27:18 notice when u turn off ur engines u slow down immediately?
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:27:29 it doesnt have momentum when in the air
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:27:46 thats an example
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:27:49 so when ur doing a cobra
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:27:54 u just go straight up
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:28:06 instead of using ur wings as drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:28:10 ur just going straight up
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:28:16 because the aerodynamics are basically nonexistant
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:28:55 a cobra is literally just using ur entire jet as an airbrake to slow down fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:29:17 ima kms
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 23:29:23 at least the guy wasnt doing a cobra
creations-chat 2023-01-10 00:22:46 the tomcats have arrived
