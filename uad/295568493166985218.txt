The Tale of Jameson (295568493166985218)
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:16:50 Testing
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:17:56 game-suggestions includes rank suggestions, correct?
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:18:23 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:18:33 Welp, alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 20:47:24 Alright, seeya
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:49:30 Can I still add another one to it?
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:49:40 Dang it
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:49:57 We had this happen at one point
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:50:23 The boat was literally sinking because all of us were on it at once
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:56:26 I just sorta want to do that again, except on an even larger scale
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:56:42 Hell, maybe even sink a carrier with our combined weight
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 02:56:10 Is craft theft bannable? Like actually stealing someone's design and posing it as your own?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 03:00:10 Make that craft theft and ramming people to disrupt their work unprovoked alongside craft theft
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 03:06:42 Long story short I made a weather balloon design, cocky4 asked "can i copy", and I simply cleaned up the creation to make sure he couldn't copy, then I look over and see him literally copying it part for part
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:07:34 Someone help with this guy?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:07:39 
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:30:37 He's FLINGING MY TANK'S HEAD AROUND, I'm not talking about with constructions either
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:33:52 I'm starting to wonder if I should learn how to hack Roblox and break the code, specifically so I can genuinely send a Trojan to that idiot's computer
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 20:36:29 Let's be honest, FE is absolute crap
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:39:05 I mean, 3/5 of the ace pilot ranks are actually easy, at least with my craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 21:39:33 Hell, I'd swap loop and aileron roll around, because if you don't have proper pitch to perform a loop, you aren't flying anyways
the-dump 2018-10-06 22:41:38 Oy, shut it about autism, I was diagnosed with that shit and I don't act like him now do I?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 22:49:11 Tell me about this autoclicker?
plane-crazy 2018-10-06 22:49:29 Nope, it turns into a laser beam
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 02:20:40 Can someone please explain why the heck this is happening!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 02:21:38 2.6, MILLION K in memory, and it was rising before I shut it off
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:56:55 Bug report: I saved this variant of my fighter at slot 7
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:57:01 Yet this happened
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:57:07 But I can still load it, and it comes out fine
bug-reports 2018-10-07 17:59:33 Question, are rocket engines SUPPOSED to be slower than the regular jet engines!?
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:26 
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:29 
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:32 That, SPEED difference
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:01:37 No I pushed them UNTIL they topped out
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:03:30 It's happening on every craft I put them on .....
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:03:51 What the, fffaaahhhhhhh, I wanted stronger engines so I could make something truly exceptional, without having to bolt on like 90 engines on
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:08:56 Hey, 7 and 8 are fine, they just don't save the name and block count, your craft it's self is still there
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:09:33 Like, as fast and easy as it is to swap those engines around, I was lazy and just decided to load the craft in
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:10:48 I mean, the extra save slots are nice, but what I was REALLY looking forward to were stronger and faster engines
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:11:56 Which, stronger, yes, these engines will really kick your craft along, faster? Look above
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:27:08 Rick, no offense, but since when is 148 a larger number than 176? 148 was achieved by swapping some of the engines out with rocket engines, 176 was with the standard default design
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:32:47 I actually double checked the controls and made sure all engines were set to the same as the jet engines originally, they were
bug-reports 2018-10-07 18:36:07 I was hoping to be able to use less engines, so that my craft wouldn't look like I just bolted as many of those things on as possible
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:26:02 Need me to bring the ramming tank over to teach him a lesson?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:26:24 I designed it specifically to punt little trolls off the map, and it works pretty well
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 18:41:20 I'd probably say redundant jet engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 18:41:33 Like, ones you won't use
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 18:41:58 Try placing them in sort of a "pod" formation, with both of the front ends facing eachother
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 18:44:29 I mean, hey, they're pretty freaking heavy for how few blocks they are, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 18:48:08 Well, if you wait for the fix, it'll still work
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:20:09 This is getting nowhere, both of you just agree to disagree and suck it up, seriously, neither of you are going to convince eachother, and you're gonna fight the mother of all uphill battles trying to convince other people
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:21:29 And like that's different TRYING to resolve the issue!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:22:20 Are you serious?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:22:58 <@!252094891448860673> , fix Dyno or something?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:24:06 <@!252094891448860673> Welp, alright
<@456226577798135808>  & <@456226577798135808> , can the both of you just PLEASE CAN IT!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:24:28 You're starting up another fight by trying to see who's "saltier", just end it for now
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:25:23 You call this "stopped"? Accusing the other person of who's saltier?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:27:10 You know what, I'm stepping out of this crap, it's just talking to a brick wall at this point
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:55:42 I need some ideas for a wing style for this fighter main body
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:57:42 It's sorta supposed to be a bit more scifi, but I'll keep that design in mind
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:58:48 When I heard you say that, I was thinking something similar to the Cylon Raiders from Battlestar Galactica
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:59:12 But god, DAMN it's hard to think of a striking wing design
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 03:36:18 That, would be extremely difficult to coordinate honestly
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 14:09:01 You're gonna want suspension and pistons, and slower limbs in general
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 17:46:49 My suggestion: Report system that ties to a votekick here
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 17:58:00 Again, it could be abused if it's only the votekick system, I've seen it been abused to hell before
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 18:22:19 Posting this here JUST incase he actually tries to copy my design, because if someone copies it, well, I'm gonna be, a bit more than pissed, he seems nice though, but just incase
bug-reports 2018-10-09 23:18:41 God dang it Xpert, why are you pushing the bar for designs higher?
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 23:19:32 Make the underbelly part, the one under the cockpit a bit longer, that's all I'd say
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 23:19:46 Otherwise, flipping nailed it so far
plane-crazy 2018-10-09 23:20:12 Ah
help 2018-10-09 23:29:54 Honestly I'd be more concerned about the center of lift than anything else right now
help 2018-10-09 23:35:19 Like, to look the best or just to work? Because they'll work pretty much anywhere you place them
help 2018-10-10 03:07:33 Shouldn't "CG" and "CP" make it obvious?
help 2018-10-10 03:07:41 CG, Center of Gravity, CP, Center of Pressure
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:28:59 We've got a thief, someone help
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:29:24 He's trying to steal my fighter's design, the one I worked AGES upon AGES on
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:34:35 No offense but that's basically the rudest thing you could've said, how would you've liked it if I copied your entire catalog and claimed it as my own, and every person believed me and called you a thief instead?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:34:55 It's happened to me before, hence why I'm marking it down here and wanting action done on it
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:35:48 Pretty much a mod wiped all my builds on that game ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:36:23 Couldn't find it ever since FE sadly
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:41:48 Empire, no offense but what's your problem with me exactly? I ask for tips on how to improve my craft and you kept on repeating the same "Pitch is key" part over and over again, while when someone copies me, you just brush it off as if it wasn't a problem, so it feels like you're just shoving me off as inferior or something of the sort
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:52:37 The thing was he bailed as soon as I said I took a screenshot, so presumably he already took a screenshot of my craft and decided to try to replicate it on his own, not much I can do without accessing his computer
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:53:39 Because as pessimistic as this sounds, what's the likely-hood of the worst case scenario? Very uncomfortably likely, at least for me
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:54:45 Fine, I'll relax, but if I wind up with my creation being plagerized I'm blaming it on both that guy's and your head, got it Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:57:17 G'night potatoe, it's about 2 here
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 05:58:05 
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 23:51:40 Remember what I said Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 23:51:49 He'll claim credit and boast it around until I'm the criminal?
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 23:51:54 Look in the upper left corner ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 23:52:40 I've got like 50 of those, yet he's still trying so hard
plane-crazy 2018-10-10 23:56:59 Can someone just come around and ban this little shit already? I'm really loosing my patience with him, to the point of swears currently, which I try to not do ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:12:59 You ain't too bad potatoe, I'd trust you with mod powers
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:15:03 Here's my proof resurfaced
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:15:04 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/499453272592089118/Capture_24.PNG
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:15:29 Notice the somewhat striking similarity between my craft's cockpit and what he was copying?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:16:54 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 00:44:24 He tried to fully copy it ...
help 2018-10-11 01:25:25 Oh, yellow is center of mass, blue is center of lift
help 2018-10-11 03:48:49 Your center of lift is so far back that it'll probably just drop like a rock no matter what
help 2018-10-11 03:49:12 That'll drive the center of mass even farther forwards
help 2018-10-11 03:49:17 You want the center of mass to be close to the center of lift
help 2018-10-11 03:56:00 It might
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 05:57:40 Facepalming to the max here
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 05:57:44 
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 05:57:47 
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:00:40 What the actual (forgive my language) flying fuck?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:04:37 And this guy's trying to say biology and metalurgy aren't main sciences
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:05:00 Can someone please come over here and murder this idiot?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:06:55 Simply put he says submarines are harder to build than spaceships, and he keeps on spewing out these absolutely dumb as fuck "ideas" about why
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:10:31 Not just that, he's denying stellar radiation, saying sunblock just solves it, he's denying micrometeors, he may as well deny the earth's round!
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:13:04 Just fucking come and help, I'm about to rip my hair off with this little shit
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:14:32 I need someone to come in here and tell him to shut the actual fuck up
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:19:04 Told him that, he didn't listen
the-dump 2018-10-11 06:19:55 Materials are just aesthetics, you have to actually program in the actual effects
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:24:17 The kind of logic I'm dealing with
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 06:33:28 Well, that's what he pointed out right there
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 16:46:29 <@456226577798135808> , I would've believed that, except he started not only throwing insults at me, but he also kept on trying to make it seem like I stole from him, so give me one ACTUAL reason I should believe you
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 16:46:51 Also, nice job fonkl
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:26:34 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:45:58 Fucking HELL THIS DUMBASS
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:46:37 He can't spell brakes (He spells them as breaks), he can't spell knowledge ("knowladge"), and he thinks he's the fucking top of the world in damn science and math!
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:49:07 
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:50:32 Xpert, rick, just, someone, can you please get this idiot out of here?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:52:30 He's actively trying to push his "knowladge" onto us, as if he's the perfect model for everything
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 17:53:33 Seriously? Nobody thinks he'd be seriously annoying?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:25:00 Someone tried to troll with a rocket, launching it at people to knock them over or out of the sky, I used my rocket tank on them, this happened
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 18:25:29 Of course involuntarily, if it was voluntary I wouldn't make a fuss about it
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:44:21 Blame Dragon, and don't axe him for it, he's a nice guy
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:44:31 For the pixel art stuff by the way
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:44:58 Keep it up and who knows, maybe Plane Crazy will be financially viable as well as crazy fun
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:45:44 HOOLY SH- THAT'S ALOT OF SERVERS
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:46:04 
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:46:54 2K or greater blocks, naval vessel?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 22:59:02 <@!252094891448860673> , you keep on leaving your stuff behind
help 2018-10-11 23:37:49 I heard it's turned pay to win
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:52:04 He wants to try to convince me that the damn thief's not really stealing my craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:52:11 Need I point out?
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:53:39 I don't give two FUCKS if it's "not similar", he's TRYING to steal my ship
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:54:47 Just keep away from me, and don't try to convince me otherwise
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:57:28 Simply put you not only associated with him, not only insulted me, but actively supported him trying to claim MY craft as his own construction
plane-crazy 2018-10-11 23:57:48 Now piss off, I don't trust people that try to backstab me once
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:03:36 How, the absolute fuck, is trying to not get betrayed/backstabbed/etc again, "racist"?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:07:39 You trekked out of your way to come over here on this server to bug me, so you're one to talk ya freaking hypocrite
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:13:40 Simply put, Blacks here (I'll refer to him as that, since it's more unique), decided to try to bug me, and he refuses to leave me alone, trying to convince me that the thief "wasn't trying to steal" my creation
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:14:21 By technicalities that's number 1 on the list, but said list was made a month ago, back when there were about 20, 30, maybe 40 ish people
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:15:03 Now there's hundreds in the server, and I'm willing to bet fairly heavily that as soon as they notice the Discord link, the floodgates will open, and that rule will be likely revised
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:15:41 Well, technically over a hundred at one point in the game so far, but, still
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:17:41 It wasn't Blacks himself, a friend of his to be exact
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:18:00 Yet Blacks keeps on CONSTANTLY trying to "Convince" me to "Forgive" his friend
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:19:01 There was literally a fiasco a few minutes/hours ago in the <#384025409945337856> section after someone seems to have stolen another person's craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:19:30 After I fucking threatened to bring the proof up to here and ban him, yet he still claimed it as his own original fucking idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:21:19 He ain't trying to defend himself to be exact, he's trying to defend his friend, yet his friend stole my design, so
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:22:49 I could still bring the hammer down on his fucking ass, you even admitted "is basically Jameson planes cockpit that flys", it's MY idea, MY design, MY effort to make something look fantastic and function well at the same time
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:25:00 I mean, if you want I can show you my first craft, basically a flying box
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:25:52 
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:27:28 One quirk about my craft is the build and function are intertwined into eachother, mostly in the wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:27:38 So if someone's copying my build, they're copying the function as well
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:28:20 Mine or his?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:28:57 "The complete copy", you claimed it has thrusters, that thing in the picture doesn't have thrusters of any sort
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:30:29 Let him have a vote honestly
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:30:40 He's biased, but he's a person
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:30:54 The plane's the neutral vote
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:32:06 How about green he gets all his saves wiped?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:32:29 Okay, fine, fine, a bit overly brutal
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:32:48 But then what exactly? It'll just be another warning
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:35:45 Keep a list and a tally of how many times said person was warned/reported/etc
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:35:53 If they reach a certain tally, take action
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:36:40 <@!252094891448860673> , To answer that question, someone tried stealing my craft, refer to the picture above, and his friend decided to make a "defense" for him
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:37:50 Xpert ... seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:37:56 Don't do a Facebook here
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:39:06 God, FFFFfffff, if my stuff ain't gonna be protected then I'm not gonna bother building in Plane Crazy anymore, also 
Ello Edward, whoever you are
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:41:22 I wouldn't mind people copying my old designs to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:41:34 Hell, my V1 fighter's so outdated, I'll let people take it as inspiration
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:41:48 But the V2 and superfighter are both off limits for everyone except my closest friends
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 00:42:25 There are a few I think
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:28:16 Do you think showing off awesome creations inspires people to play more, or does it intimidate people away?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:28:24 Or a mixture of both?
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:29:24 Alright I suppose, time to fly around and inspire people I guess
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:30:34 Also, fucking hate WFYB, I literally built what's essentially a god tower in that game, one made purely of the strongest parts possible, with tiny little gunnery slits, only for the creator to add not only better alloys that you pretty much HAD to pay for, but weapons that made previous plating almost obsolete
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:30:43 And he used a balance of helium, duh
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 17:30:52 It's like walking on a tightrope essentially
bug-reports 2018-10-12 17:55:15 Camera gets stuck sometimes in one position, whether it's a huge gargantuan craft, or a tiny tinfoil glider
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 18:35:06 Apparently people are following me into the game because they think it's getting interesting
plane-crazy 2018-10-12 21:14:45 I deserve a "flight instructor" medal or something, I actually taught a guy how to build a plane and fly
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 02:21:26 Hey, a warp drive's a concept, not a creation kiwi
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 02:25:01 Well then create a proper warp drive fighter or something and patent it
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 02:25:35 Or hell, suggest that an actual warp drive be added, the magnets' effect of doing, well, warping you, be removed, and ask for your recognition of something like that
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 20:59:25 What's in the update?
plane-crazy 2018-10-13 23:30:04 I'll keep out until I know my craft will 100% save, especially my largest one
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:54:36 Would a creation wipe be fine for that guy?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:55:22 How about a save wipe to save on data, then ban him?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:56:17 To be 100% honest, I'd use my rocket tank, but 
1: I'm not sure if my creations would save, I heard a few error reports here and there
2: It doesn't work on a "creation" like his, you need a box to contain the rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:56:47 Orange, a data wipe's too nice for someone like him, wipe his data to free up some space and permaban him
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:56:59 Also do you realize how much pushing power rockets have? He'd just push the box off
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:57:38 Then he'll copy the warp drive and break through with that instead
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:58:07 Trolls aren't idiots ya know, they do have SOME degree of intelligence
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:58:52 You know what, add a check for how much lag players cause, if there's a massive influx of data from one player, kick them
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:59:10 And I mean something MASSIVE, like that giant pile of rockets that guy has
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 03:59:34 I don't mean "Oh the server's slowing down" I mean "People are genuinely crashing while miles away" levels of lag
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 04:00:18 Ahem, what do you call my giant fighter? People don't lag TOO badly thanks to that, meanwhile with those rockets, well, people are crashing
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 04:01:27 Well, the problem with moderation is that you can only get so many moderators to monitor so many servers
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 04:02:17 That's why it's a kick rather than a ban
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:14:40 Then set up an automated system, or a parts to engines ratio
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:15:42 Also, Danny, you can't block 999 rockets pointed in the general direction of everyone
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:15:54 All wired up to fly like individual parts
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:19:38 I'd say to Mad, if he doesn't want in-game mods, he needs to have a system to detect and catch these people, and I seriously doubt that he can detect and catch bad shapes or paint
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:20:43 That's what I mentioned yesterday Imperial, however, at the same time, you could get falsely booted for that
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:20:57 So I suggested making it a far gentler punishment, a kick rather than a ban
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:21:43 Also a warning after passing a certain amount of parts, "Due to trollers and lag spammers, your creation may result in you being kicked, please save your creation before launching it"
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:22:06 Er, no, I don't approve of the ban thing Imperial, mostly because people might genuinely have huge 4K+ creations that make the server shit it's self
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:22:30 Because the building box is too small for it to be in 1 part
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:22:56 No, he uses motors to make it folding
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:23:10 Think sorta like an origami plane, sorta
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:24:33 Can't blame him, blame the game
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:24:49 He just wanted to build a giant and awesome carrier for people to land on, which we have done successfully
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:24:59 And I'd imagine your giant plane broke a few people's plots Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:25:30 Probably because you've got alot of wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:25:36 And possibly some helium
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:25:48 More wings = more floatiness
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:26:42 Also, is it safe to join and not loose all my creations yet? I want to be 100% sure my creations aren't gonna get axed, especially my superfighter
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:27:12 Alright, thanks
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:27:40 Worst comes to worst I have the pictures and blueprints so I can rebuild the one I ABSOLUTELY want to keep
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:28:56 Control surface paint was killed, but that's easy to fix
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:31:39 Why are all my creations saving with one block extra? They're still using less data, so it's fine, but still
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:32:02 I DEFINITELY remember my tank (Not the push tank) saving with 302 blocks, now it's got 303
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:32:47 Also the fighter MK 1 and MK 2 swapped spots, they were save slots 8 and 7 respectively
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:34:05 On another note, I saw this kind of growth pattern in another game, one that I actually helped to support and balance in it's early days, Tower Battles
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:34:35 OH WHAT THE F- THE COLOR SCHEME ON THE ENGINES GOT SCREWED UP!
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:37:15 You've got like one extra dimension to maneuver around, you're fine, most drinking and driving crashes are because another car leaps infront
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:37:25 Plus the instruments would warn you LONG before you hit the ground
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:40:11 Did rocket engines get nerfed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:40:41 They got nerfed, oh, FAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:41:14 God damn it, my superfighter was built pre-nerf, now that they're nerfed I can barely lift off!
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:43:12 I could tell they got nerfed because I couldn't pull straight up with reverse thrust, which were all set to the correct keybinds (12 rocket thrusters total in the side engine pods, not actually that hard or tedious to check)
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:46:03 If I remember correctly, I used to clock around 140 with reverse thrust straight vertically (That may've been horizontal though, not sure), now I can't even get lift during a straight vertical, and I can barely do so with the forward thrust, which I literally packed the interior with
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:47:25 I literally remember someone asking how many helium blocks it had, and I had to show them it had 0 helium blocks in it
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:47:52 I'm just, FAAAHHH I'M PISSED OFF AT THAT
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:50:32 ...... rickje
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:50:33 Rick
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:50:41 Rickyrick, remember how you said saves were fixed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:51:03 Remember, how you said the save system was fixed? How come I'm not able to load anything then? Absolutely NOTHING
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:51:35 It says the blocks are there, it says I'm still occupying data, so why can't I LOAD ANYTHING!?
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:51:58 All my planes are as good as dead ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:52:36 Just make blocks and drop them on someone's face
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:52:46 No, you need to hit someone, not just the dirt
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 19:53:41 Just, someone tell me why my craft aren't loading in
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:56:02 https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-fdcd7f6aa481.gif
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:56:42 I can wait as long as I want and it won't load in
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:57:09 I HOPPED LIKE 10 SERVERS!
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:58:24 I was on public server to public server!
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:58:41 https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-f24c2dd1554d.gif
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:59:24 I am, GENUINELY FUCKING PISSED OFF TO HELL ABOUT THIS
bug-reports 2018-10-14 19:59:52 Okay, it loads in the private server, but not the public ones
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:03:37 Rick, this isn't a case of not being able to load on older servers, this is a case if I CAN'T LOAD ON ANY SERVER, EVEN THE NEW ONE I REJOINED WITH THE SAME PEOPLE ON IT
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:20:18 Honestly by this point I'd suggest just reverting back to the old system
bug-reports 2018-10-14 20:21:32 I'd suggest just not coloring it yet
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:27:01 I'm gonna just stay off until saving is fixed, and rockets are stronger
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:29:56 Superidra, look at the gifs in <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:30:22 .... Oh wait one of them's stupidly sh- hold on while I get a new one
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:31:48 Okay, fuck Dyno
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:32:01 Just, fuck Dyno, but saving seems to work now, at least partially
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 20:51:13 Then build a starfighter, that idea's broad enough that there's still unique creations, yet narrow enough that you can think of something
bug-reports 2018-10-14 21:47:56 It pulls out sort of an error log
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 22:53:50 Right, I need to start using warp engines, specifically on my huge craft, how much space do they occupy?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 22:55:05 I could build horizontal ones for the primary thrusters, but for maneuvering ones, like roll, yaw, etc, that's gonna be tricky, are they just gonna be always on, or are they able to turn off as well?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 22:55:56 Ah, that ain't gonna work then
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 23:01:56 Think it could work in reverse?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 23:05:25 Welp, outa the question for me then, I need forward and reverse thrust on my craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 01:44:02 It's a usage of glitches in order to launch a vehicle at stupid speeds
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 01:44:21 Magnets?
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 01:45:13 Then what!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 02:15:46 Hello_Seaquest
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 16:50:36 Is it just me or did the creativity in this entire server bump up to stupidly high levels as soon as we passed the 100 concurrent player threshold
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 18:54:10 Were rockets buffed, or are they still weak?
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 18:57:44 Huh, seems like a scifi corporation
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 19:00:48 If it is, mind if I join along?
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 19:06:27 Ello
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 19:16:11 That's more like a helium rocket, interesting
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 19:17:03 Try making one with actual controls, like control in all directions, rather than just up, because as far as I can tell, that one's only going up
plane-crazy 2018-10-15 20:49:51 Honestly, the rocket nerf broke my plane, so I need something stronger that's 2X1 to get it working again
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 00:48:37 Center of lift's too far back, with so many wings you're gonna smash your nose into the ground repeatedly from the downforce
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 04:37:25 Pretty much 99% of people's first plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 01:36:54 It's been stabbed for me, and I hear alot of reports that it's down, so
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 01:37:41 Whup, it's back up
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 01:39:03 Huh, it's partially up for me
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 02:02:39 How so? Show a picture?
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 02:12:19 Oh man that cone looks awesome, also just look up "video to gif" converter or something, gifs show up on here
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 02:12:54 Also, ehhhh, I'm not sure it's that
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 02:13:10 Actually nevermind, it's that, most of the thrust's under your center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 02:13:37 Imagine pushing a piece of wood at the bottom, the bottom's gonna move faster than the top, but because it's rigid, it'll wind up rotating rather than being left behind
help 2018-10-17 17:43:57 Basically dampening's the deceleration (opposite of acceleration) of the springs
help 2018-10-17 17:44:25 So in theory, max stiffness and zero dampening means they'll pretty much spring around like insanity
plane-crazy 2018-10-17 23:00:21 How even? There's no magnets on that thing
help 2018-10-17 23:00:39 Pistons so the claw can shrink upon it's self?
help 2018-10-18 00:36:08 Want me to give you my push tank, or is that a bit too heavy?
help 2018-10-18 00:36:26 Alright, I'll try to find which server you're in, give me a moment
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:10:22 No offense but that just seems extraordinarily elitist
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:10:42 Like, what's wrong with literally every single person in this server (aside from the "og" people)
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:17:31 What do you honestly expect? Where there's popularity, there's trolling
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:18:15 Correction, popularity, pay to pay to win, and encouraging cancer
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:18:59 I literally saw a layered lootbox on one of the Roblox games today, you had to pay for the lootbox, then pay for like 90% of the shit you got from it ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:20:18 Plane Crazy's old days caused me to leave, mostly because some people were REALLY hostile and aggressive to anyone that couldn't build either an innovative creation, or a giant folding craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:21:28 Tell that to the freaking folding boeings I keep on seeing! And had been seeing way back then to
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:22:25 And you were harassed to hell if you didn't have a commercial airliner
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:22:45 Dude, all I can say is deal with it, plus with the old blocks you could've still seriously griefed
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:23:15 Jet engine spam ain't so different compared to rocket engine spam
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:24:31 My super fighter wouldn't even be able to fly without the new blocks, and even now, with the rockets still nerfed, I still can't fly it
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:25:01 Imperial, the jets aren't strong enough, I tried
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:25:20 Maneuvering's still been shot in the foot, which I need both force and speed for
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:26:34 Hey, remember that zero G space shuttle? Would literally be impossible without helium blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:27:20 Quite a few of the boats I know use helium to balance without compromising their looks
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:28:18 Hey, my MK 1 fighter was having balance issues, so I used helium on the front half of the spine, and ballast on the back half, and it balanced out really well
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:30:17 Maybe you placed helium at the bottom instead of the top? Either way, helium is a tool, not the means it's self, it just makes the means easier
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:39:44 That's more like a death shotgun honestly than a death ray, or a death thrower (Because flames aren't badass enough)
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:40:33 Just look at the core of most planes with warp drives, they're very, VERY similar
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:42:45 Try using a video to gif converter
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:42:51 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:43:08 I'll just convert em for ya
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:44:09 https://im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-e923b09a65a9.gif
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:44:20 FOR FUCK'S, DYNO, SCREW OFF!
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:44:25 https://im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-fae2b9c9b13f.gif
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:44:56 Erhm, first one ain't loading, gonna quickly reload it
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:44:59 https://im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-e923b09a65a9.gif
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:45:04 There we go
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:45:49 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 01:46:44 I think what happened was you murdered Imperial on your screen, but because he wasn't actually dead, it was only clientside, so while it looked like his stuff fell apart, in actuality it was all still there, but because it was considered part of his player character, it disassembled
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 02:05:00 I think you'll just clip through them more than anything else
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:00:31 Was that rocket engine that I just saw any stronger by any chance?
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:01:22 Damn it, I need either adjustable strength that's higher than what it currently is, or a new and stronger engine to make my superfighter working again
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:02:21 If I add any more engines to maneuver I am going to absolutely MURDER it's look, meanwhile if I add helium, well, it's perfectly balanced and it floats as if it had helium
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:03:36 Quite literally I packed every single maneuvering thruster inside to avoid ruining it's look, that's why it doesn't maneuver on an atom like I tried to get with my (now worthless) arena fighter, this one's built for style and a decent performance, not over the top performance with a decent style
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:05:36 As you might imagine that was a royal pain in the butt to do, especially for the roll thrusters, which I had to get really creative with and jam them in the engine pods on the wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:05:50 All rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:06:11 The issue is I've tried the V2, two iterations, one with rockets, one without, it performs all-around better with rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:06:48 I hope they're either ramjets (I'm thinking Learn 2 Fly style, big rectangular engines of "OH MY GOD" speed), or a new scifi engine or something
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:34:33 Hence why I suggested making a criteria for the actual bombs, so you can't just attach blocks, infact
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:39:13 If it's a 3X3 I'm gonna be seriously annoyed, I need 2X1s, because those are JUST within my size limit for most of the fighter
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 17:43:47 Well I can't wait, hell, maybe I'll be able to patch up some of the (too many to count) gaps that I left everywhere in my fighter, just so I could cram engines in to make it fly
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 23:20:33 1: Yes Danny?
2: That plane ain't too bad, although I'm questioning the CoM to CoL
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 23:21:35 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-18 23:26:10 The beginner's guide ain't a "solve it all" thing, but it's got most of the basics covered to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:43:19 Screenshot of it happening if you may?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:44:20 Eh, did you take a screenshot?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:44:48 That, isn't really helpful sadly
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:46:08 I'll, see if I can find more
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:46:34 The guy looks like this?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:46:35 https://t3.rbxcdn.com/b574a9e70fd8ebb593bdfb9e6ff4c0b7
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:47:11 Where's your CoL and CoM <@!137032067740336128>
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:47:22 If they're too far away, you'll flop into the ground
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:47:57 Oh no wonder, you need to push it back quite a bit farther
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:48:12 Keep the CoM and CoL (Orange and blue) close together
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:48:27 Also, Deception, as far as I can tell he's gone, but I'll keep an eye out for him
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:49:30 Missile based bombers are actually unoriginal, attach an engine to a bomb and there you go, a missile, but to make an effective one is somewhat difficult
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:50:51 It's still too far forwards and too high up, at least a bit too much, check engine placement as well
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:50:58 If you have alot of engines on the belly of your craft, it's gonna flip
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:51:14 How many parts?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:51:56 Ehhhhhhh, I mean, advanced builder ain't too difficult to achieve, and if I had to make a rough guess I'd say that, unless those are beams, that's around 250 parts
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:52:22 I know
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:52:37 I'm just parking myself over here, totten, a SCREENSHOT of the save slot
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:52:51 .....
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:52:57 A screenshot of the craft, and the actual save slot
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:53:04 Like this
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:53:09 And do it in creations please for the love of god
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:53:57 Alright, done, someone give him the rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:54:23 Advanced is 250+
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:54:41 Does it fly?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:55:03 Alright, that boat will work
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:55:11 Blame Deception
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:55:17 He told them to ping you
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:57:09 For the love of, Deception, can it, Empire, leave it to me to explain, Dragon, please stay out of it, thank you
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:57:32 Right, totten, if you have a 700-800+ block craft, post the screenshot and save slot
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:58:06 We can't run off of word of mouth or assumptions, so proof will help
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:58:23 Like so
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:58:44 The craft it's self, then the save slot
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 02:59:46 It's sorta to show off that you did something awesome
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:01:44 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/502674461804199936/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:01:44 Not quite like that, whole craft in screenshot, like you did before, I'll just re-shuffle it
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:02:40 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:02:49 It's closer, but you're still gonna pitch up, though just not as severely
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:04:18 I'll bring my fighter out for a quick second
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:05:38 Nevermind ._. This thing must have some hellish engine misweighting
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:06:04 If you're still curious
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:06:12 That achieves this straight line
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:06:34 No, not even close
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:07:22 This is more or less like it
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:07:40 Also that's a joke thing r_aid
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:07:45 Happens randomly
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:08:28 Anyways, both of those craft fly in relatively the same trajectory, someone please explain!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:09:12 Yeah, the game's addictive ain't it?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:32:55 Host a fighter competition next week?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:36:47 In <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:37:36 Blame Deception, he tends to be ping-happy
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:38:52 
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 03:38:56 Do I need to say more?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:25:37 Jesus freaking christ, 200+ people at one point? The heck happened!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:26:35 Ripping this from the top of the chat
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:26:36 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/502837024991084564/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:26:40 See?
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:27:19 Hey, credit to minec for pointing it out
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 16:29:42 Sorry minec, but <@!260797229068058634> , that's who
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 21:10:02 Extra engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 21:49:15 Use the propeller blades
help 2018-10-19 22:20:22 I'd say stick with keyboard controls, mostly because mouse controls always seemed a bit, iffy to me
plane-crazy 2018-10-19 22:38:02 <@!298214157533184002> , you're being challenged
help 2018-10-19 23:52:07 Nowhere near there, jesus, keep it close to the center of mass
help 2018-10-19 23:53:41 It matters where your engines are located, but otherwise not really
help 2018-10-19 23:53:52 If the engines are high above the center of mass, you'll pitch downwards still
help 2018-10-19 23:59:00 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:20:02 The head would be the most difficult part, but I could see how you can use slopes, it'd have to be freaking huge though, and not genuine treads
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:24:03 Afl- just what do you think this is!? This ain't Hogwarts, this is Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:24:36 The aerodynamics needed for that, you'd have to brute force it so god damn hard
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:24:52 Which rank?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:26:34 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:27:20 The Hydra? Seriously? You really do like GTA don't you?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:29:10 H- totten, how are the wings gonna assemble?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:29:58 It's not gonna fly, I can garuntee, it ... WHAT, THE, HECK!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 00:30:27 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 02:50:00 Has anyone figured out a way to make a craft that can freely strafe yet?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 02:50:41 If so, 1: Teach me, 2: I have an idea, to make it fully realized though it requires horizontal strafing
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 03:00:46 Don't forget, you've got limitations that, no matter how hard you try, you won't break out of, so plan carefully
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 03:03:37 Yello
help 2018-10-20 03:36:11 I listed out a set of parts already ...
help 2018-10-20 03:36:22 Jet engines, regular blocks (including wedges, 1X2 wedges and corner wedges), regular beams, all the 1X2 wings (not propeller blades however), motors, propeller ENGINES (not blades, there's a difference), landing gear, wheels and suspension are what I can remember off the top of my head
help 2018-10-20 03:36:34 Unpainted, that's how Arena works for now
help 2018-10-20 03:43:34 Arena's gonna be updated soon, so hold your horses until then, got it?
help 2018-10-20 03:45:04 Because it's more professional and generally better received, also less proof-reading later
help 2018-10-20 03:55:30 Hey, no need to be a jerk about it
help 2018-10-20 03:55:47 And believe me, I could swear you the hell out, I just choose not to honestly
help 2018-10-20 04:19:17 ...... <@!304977711988867072> , can you please deal with this before I decide to deal with it myself?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:22:34 CoL's too far forwards, bump it a bit back, show engine placements?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:23:09 Engines ought to be good, although add more velocity if it doesn't work
help 2018-10-20 04:24:32 You do realize that they don't HAVE to list "don't be a little shit", because that's just common sense and basic human decency, right? Or are you saying you're just an annoying troll that deserves to be stomped on until you're a forgettable pile of pulp?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:26:13 It might still flip a bit, but it should be, at the very least workable
help 2018-10-20 04:27:49 Do I need to say more?
help 2018-10-20 04:28:04 Do I honestly need to say more? You even openly admitted to being actively annoying
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:28:16 Either more or bigger engines, you aren't limited to just 2 after all
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:28:26 If you're still struggling, I'd suggest doing a bit of manual work
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:28:35 Cram some engines facing a certain way set to controls
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:29:02 Example: Cram an engine in the nose facing straight up set to W, and an engine facing downwards in the nose set to S, then you pull up with W, and down with S
help 2018-10-20 04:29:42 So I'm the "agressor" for being called "nerd"? Quite frankly I think you need to crawl back to whatever delusional black hole you came out of and rot there with the rest of the trolling and annoying part of Roblox
help 2018-10-20 04:30:54 And you think that's not being annoying at all? Say that to yourself and tell me that's not annoying with a straight non-lying face
help 2018-10-20 04:32:21 This way, I try to be polite and you just throw shit in my face in return, and I will keep using this as evidence until you snap out of your delusion, wake up and actually realize what you've done, unless you'd like to specify
help 2018-10-20 04:33:16 Well what am I supposed to do? Just let him try to annoy me to high hell?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:33:31 Ah, what the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:33:36 OH! your control surfaces might be in reverse
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:33:43 Yeah they're in reverse
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:34:06 When they go down, that's gonna drag you down
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:34:14 They should go up when you want to pull up, and down when you want to pull down
help 2018-10-20 04:34:35 And you think being called a "nerd" is a complement, or even remotely fine?
help 2018-10-20 04:34:49 If that's the case, specify it, because that's not a fucking complement in most people's dictionaries
help 2018-10-20 04:35:44 Let me guess, you just wanted to cause a fuss and get yourself banned, is that it?
help 2018-10-20 04:37:04 ..... I'm just gonna stop for now, obviously I'm talking to someone who's got something wrong in their damn head, some fucking neuron's been severed or knocked off course or something
help 2018-10-20 04:42:32 Meh, I usually ask people whether to do so or not, and I tend to flag alot, but not actually take action on it, because I'm aware of my admittedly short fuse, and I build around it
help 2018-10-20 04:45:13 Dragon, fucking back me up on this, is he, or is he not just being a jackass for no reason whatsoever other than to be one?
help 2018-10-20 04:47:27 And your "laughter" is quite frankly twisted, horrid, and generally only reserved for people we put in prisons or to death, now piss the actual fuck off before someone decides to act upon that
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:48:10 Nice, they were reversed weren't they?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:49:04 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:52:33 You wanna use it in arena, correct?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:53:51 Center of lift's too far forwards, that's why it's trying to tip up, bump it back a bit and it'll start tilting back again
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 04:57:59 I mean, it's tipping up less, right? Bump it back a bit further
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:41:41 Shhhhh, don't mention it and nobody will notice
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:42:01 Now I'm tempted to try to cram my fighter in there, rick! Are the new engines out yet or not!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:42:56 RIP, what did he do?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:43:21 Ah, so Elonso's a test account?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:43:29 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:43:44 Ello, if, Ifj's an actual person
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:45:24 Inferno, think I can land this on your ferry?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:45:47 Maneuvering's a bit crippled on it, but it's still mostly functional
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:46:57 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:47:19 Got it, hope it doesn't sink
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:47:43 Wait which server are you in? Dah, it's hard to find specific servers now
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:48:20 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 17:50:25 I warned you didn't I?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 18:07:34 They should blend relatively seamlessly into the actual body of your craft, if not, you might've put them in reverse
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 18:11:09 It's the community server, first one in the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 18:45:40 Starting to wonder if I should leave, there's only so much Roblox cancer I can bear with
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 18:56:53 <#501034677793193994> , if that doesn't work, let's see your craft?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:06:03 Center of lift's way too far back, bring it forwards, and you need a yaw control surface, or get 2 roll control surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:06:13 Yaw is left and right, roll is, obviously roll
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:06:46 Just get two that alternate, one goes up, one goes down, the one that goes up is the direction you're rotating
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:06:56 Ah, you've got auto controls?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:08:18 That's similar to what I use, except Z and X for throttle
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:08:21 Wait, secondary? Why?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:35:40 If by paper you mean plane, then not even close, there's actual aerodynamics and performance with your creations, and you can do some really clever stuff, unlike BYM
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:36:35 BYM you mostly just build giant blocky creations, Plane Crazy you build really elegant and awesome planes, or transforming stuff, or just some fancy pixel art because you wanted to
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:38:12 RIP, Orange got nuked by the bot, yet Empire's immune to it
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:38:30 Nope, now you're both being royally stabbed by it
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 19:39:38 Try reading the <#501034677793193994> , if it doesn't work, ask for help in <#478584971670454284> or here, and show a picture of the plane
help 2018-10-20 21:07:28 Did you place control surfaces on?
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:10:56 Control surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:11:26 You probably put them in reverse then
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:12:16 They're set to auto controls then, that means they're mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:13:36 1: How do you honestly expect to fly with THAT tiny of a control surface!?
2: Your center of lift is far too low and far back
3: You don't need that much engine power
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:24:49 You need to bump it farther back now
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:25:03 Keep the center of lift as close as possible to the center of mass, preferably a tiny bit infront of it
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:27:33 Yeah, more or less
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 21:30:29 If it's auto-controlled, you've got mouse controls, otherwise re-bind the keys
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:16:16 I'd say right gets more grip, left is more stable
plane-crazy 2018-10-20 23:16:22 Left for drifting cars, right for off-roaders
help 2018-10-21 01:54:28 You can make a "plane" fly without wings ya know
help 2018-10-21 01:55:03 Hence the quotes
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 02:44:05 I think they were added alongside the helium
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 02:45:45 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:00:25 Hmmmm, mind if I yoink the fuselage for my next project? I'll give credit for it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:01:03 It's gonna be hard to fix, so good luck
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:01:47 Also, again, is it fine if I take the fuselage (The body) for my next project? Again, I'll mention "Credit to Grablador for the body" every time with it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:02:20 I'm gonna assume, with a lack of response, no, dang it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:02:35 G'morning

general 2018-10-21 20:20:24 Is that an Avali I see starc?
general 2018-10-21 20:21:10 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:22:12 Sorry, I don't pay those pay to pay to play games (At least from the various rumors I heard it seems that way)
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:22:50 Nah, lizard boy got one of my friends interested
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:23:14 Too much repetitive and uninteresting time to do anything?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:23:53 Mark Zuck, except not a data hog as well?
general 2018-10-21 20:24:08 Let me guess, you fired, and the bullets ripped through your own craft?
general 2018-10-21 20:24:31 I'd imagine that's what would happen if you're faster than the bullets
general 2018-10-21 20:24:41 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:25:53 Still waiting for those stronger engines by the way, I feel like the only one in here that doesn't fill some giant niche, whether it's supercarriers, walkers, warp drives, cranes or something else
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:26:05 I just design giant non-motorized craft
general 2018-10-21 20:26:37 Novelty and to GTFO when you're being shot at?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:28:36 Did you seriously just challenge Empire to a ping war?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:28:50 You're gonna get floored ya know
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:37:13 Mini (surprisingly friendly) server war? (Sorta like a snowball fight?)
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:37:42 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:39:06 What do you mean by that exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 20:57:16 You want your CoM (Orange/yellow) to be as close as possible to your CoL (Blue), but the CoL should be slightly infront
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:17:15 I feel like you could make a trailer using VTOLs buzzing around a giant supercraft or something, like one of the boeings
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:19:35 I meant using multiple players, not just one person doing it
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:24:07 What, the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:24:23 Did anyone else get audio from chumbo saying "Breach found"?
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:25:48 Okay that was just a TTS glitch, thank FUCK
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:25:55 Just incase I'm virus scanning my computer
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:26:56 Not funny potatoe, seriously not funny
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:27:24 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:27:52 Yeah, general's broken, gonna mute it

plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:45:30 Even after refreshing
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:45:53 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:46:06 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:46:51 Nada
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:47:02 Even after refreshing
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:48:12 Yeah, it works
plane-crazy 2018-10-21 21:48:40 Yeup, it's working now
help 2018-10-22 03:07:51 Answer: No, reason: Look at the criteria
help 2018-10-22 03:11:40 Do we really need to go over this again? Let me guess, I'm gonna be "aggressive", and you're gonna play the victim again, even after attempting to insult me?
help 2018-10-22 03:13:11 Just fuck off
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:04:09 Which role? Carrier?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:04:40 Well, in the water yeah I suppose
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:06:40 A magnet drive's what's also known as a warp drive, simply put it's a glitch found with magnets that makes you go "Oh my god" levels of fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:35 People have made "magnet drives" in the past, so no need to hide it
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:08:52 Just ctrl+F "Warp drive"
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:09:04 And what does "precision levels" mean exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:14:13 There's 2 reasons I'm not helping you totten
1: You spammed all the channels! For the love of crap, you don't need to spam every single channel, just <#478584971670454284> and <#384021699466756107>, and even then do it in ONE of those channels
2: It's very late and I should be sleeping
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:21:04 It's 12:20AM over here, for the love of, er, Empire, is it fine if I swear?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:22:00 Just, it's 12:21AM now, alot of people are sleeping, did it ever cross your mind that not everyone's on whatever timezone you're in?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:22:34 Sorry if this is excessively rude, but next time, think about the fact that you're on a planet, not some island where every person's bunched around you
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 04:23:18 And incase you're wondering, yes, I'm a "bit" pissed off at you just spamming the channels like that
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 05:32:25 IT IS 1:31 __**AM**__ TOTTEN, for the love of god, ask at 3:00 PM and maybe more people will answer
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 05:33:37 I'm just finishing up a resume to see if I can write one for class, that's why I'm up so late, but incase you didn't notice, a fairly huge chunk of the server's offline, you aren't gonna get a response asking open space
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 05:33:52 Ask whatever server you're on or ask later
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 05:52:36 Oh hey Empire, I'm gonna sign off now, g'night everyone
help 2018-10-22 11:47:55 What type? Pitch? Yaw? Roll?
help 2018-10-22 11:48:43 Pitch is up and down, yaw is left and right, roll is, obviously roll, clockwise or counterclockwise
help 2018-10-22 11:50:01 If you want something to maneuver quickly, you want control surfaces, and/or thrust as far from the center of mass as possible in your direction
help 2018-10-22 11:50:19 Aka: A "brute force" strategy is more effective further from the center of mass (yellow orb)
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 11:58:50 Just look at <#501034677793193994> and scale up from there
help 2018-10-22 12:24:06 If you're struggling to take off, you need the center of lift (blue orb) closer to the center of mass (yellow orb)
help 2018-10-22 12:24:32 If it's too far forwards, you'll pitch upwards and only upwards, if it's too far back, your craft will want to smash into the floor
help 2018-10-22 12:24:40 Well this is Roblox, you don't need structural integrity for most things
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:41:23 Alright, why?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:41:26 google.com
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:41:28 www.google.com
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:41:49 If this goes wrong blame Rick
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:10 Let me try something
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:12 www.youtube.com
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:21 So,
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:23 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:42:55 So now we're just seeing where it breaks?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:43:08 https://www.roblox.com/home
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:43:46 https://twitter.com/madattakRBLX
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:44:13 I feel like we're just grabbing hammers and just smashing it to see if it'd break, and so far it looks completely broken
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:48:06 I'm gonna pick a quartet of links, one to this server, one to Plane Crazy, one to Youtube, and one of a Google search of budgies (Because why not?), when you want me to break things, ask
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:54:10 https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=969&ei=nMbNW8HtOqep_QaLvaWQCg&q=budgies&oq=budgies&gs_l=img.3..0l10.707.1465..1507...1.0..0.33.247.8......0....1..gws-wiz-img.KOsLRipTswI
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:56:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 12:56:46 There we go
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 14:02:11 RICK! SPEED UP THE UPDATE PLEASE, I AM GETTING WAY TOO TEMPTED TO WARP DRIVE
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 18:53:46 Fonkl, here's some references via DM
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 18:54:02 Build one of those will ya? I know you can do it easily
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 18:54:34 They ain't helis, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:35:59 Seems like the Aurora needs an escort
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:36:22 (Forgive me for this Rick), once <@!217336009455566848> gets the new engines in, I'll fly escort
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:39:08 Ehhhhhhh, sorta, I just want something stronger
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:41:07 I mean, that's a tiny craft rick, propel something huge with it and I'll be impressed, but so far it's an improvement
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:42:01 I feel like infinitely strong, but scalable (Like, power scaling) engines would make the game too easy, but at the same time, it'd allow for amazing builds
general 2018-10-22 19:44:45 Give me like 50 of them please, I want a dancing bird army that I can hug
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:46:20 Rick, minor idea, add a reference to fonkl's craft, a crashed Aurora in many pieces
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:47:19 His craft is so huge it crashes the servers, and what happens when there's no pilots inside?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:49:04 Still though, fonkl, you starting up the ideas I sent ya?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:49:32 Just pick any, I'd love to see them
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:50:20 Aw, not the Raiden or Axelay?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:51:33 Meh, alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:52:54 Yeeeeeuhoh
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:54:48 It's a giant spaceship actually
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:55:54 Wait seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 19:56:07 Huh, I thought it would've been a station, considering how mobile it is
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 20:18:47 RIP, mad, why?
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 22:07:05 RIP kiwi
plane-crazy 2018-10-22 23:58:12 Meh, inflation in our favor then
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:00:24 That's just completely questionable to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:01:21 You can inflate the current amount playing, the vote ratio, the favorites, etc, but you can't inflate the views, because if you inflate them at all, people just have to look it up, and that's too much to be reasonable for so few views
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:02:11 **IF** Imperial's is fake (Not saying it is, but IF it is), it's actually reasonable enough to get people believing it
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:07:45 Too far stretched, again, you can't inflate visits, you'll only make yourselves look like liars, because that evidence is easy to grab
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:10:05 Oy, I'm just making sure your name isn't crapped on, if you're caught lying, you'll be considered a liar for good
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:10:26 Something tells me they're all in the same squad, none of them are complaining about the other copying
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:10:38 It's the same VTOL 3 times over
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:26:23 I think it's already over
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:29:40 Can someone come over here and shout some sense into this idiot?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:29:50 Bue to be exact
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:29:59 I'm in a public server with a friend that got interested
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:30:17 
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:32:24 Ah, welp
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:32:30 Just how I look like or my actual profile?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:32:48 https://www.roblox.com/users/47139332/profile
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:33:10 Erhm, don't question it
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:33:48 AH CRA- ffffff
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:33:58 Clicked too fast, RIP, things calmed down though
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:34:32 Yeah, thanks anyways for offering to help
general 2018-10-23 00:40:17 Welp
general 2018-10-23 00:40:35 Now make the wings hide and "woosh" out, and it's TRULY airplane mode
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:43:22 For a phone that's freaking colossal, even publicity stunts would shy away
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:49:24 Engines, that's how
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:49:29 Or reaction wheels
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:50:26 Make a motor with alot of weight on it, and make it spin, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-10-23 00:54:51 I know the mechanic he's using, it's a stabilization mechanic
help 2018-10-23 00:55:09 Real world physics uses it in alot of stuff, including bullets and rockets
help 2018-10-23 00:55:43 A spinning object doesn't like to stop spinning, and to turn it, you need to use ALOT of force, and I mean a FUCKTON
help 2018-10-23 00:56:01 So give it a spin and it'll fly in a straight line with a, not 100%, but a very sizable garuntee
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 00:58:39 RIIICK! YOU BROKE MY BOMBER TO! It can't fly anymore
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:11:54 I mean look at this
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:11:58 Dang it
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:13:41 Ever watch Robot Wars, or, whatever it's called now?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:14:13 I can convert my rocket tank to a flipper bot very easily, would that count?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:21:51 And with a 28 block add-on and an 8 block conversion
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:36:02 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:36:31 I made a Robot Wars flipper bot, and quite the potent one to
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:36:46 Due to Roblox physics though, it wouldn't actually flip, other vehicles, but if it did, well
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 01:36:56 I could probably send your rocket to near orbit with just the bot alone
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 03:00:29 It was supposed to end Sunday I believe
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 18:50:21 Fonkl, what the heck? How come yo get the new special engines early!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 18:52:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 18:53:25 I need it, sorta badly at this point, my superfighter needs either a complete facelift or a new engine to revamp it with, one of which are far easier than the other, and are coming out next update
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 18:55:22 Don't worry fonkl, they're still valuable
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:49:39 You're allowed control engines for all the roles, I think, so long as they don't actually influence your primary movement, for helis, that's up and down
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:49:51 Am I correct on this Super?
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:50:46 Yaw is the left and right movement, so try adding engines to the tail and nose
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:52:19 To be 100% honest I'm sure nobody would mind anthro if the community wasn't as toxic as it was
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:52:41 ._. Don't stab me everyone
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:53:23 Also, exactly Super, imagine if online dating was actually seriously cracked down on in Roblox, like, places that had any traces of it got blasted
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 22:59:40 We already talked about it rick
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:00:21 Personally I think it's not bad, it's just the way it's being used that's bad, similar to how a knife isn't bad, but you can use it in bad ways
plane-crazy 2018-10-23 23:11:51 Did, Xpert seriously place a chat timer thing in there?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:30:07 What the actual fuck? (Which mod should I send this through, I'm almost certain it shouldn't be posted here, although I'm not sure)
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:31:44 Tweaked motor speeds, absolutely zero engines?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:33:55 Extra prop length? Check if motors are truly going the direction you want?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:35:16 Are all the motors with props, or just the end one?
general 2018-10-24 00:36:26 I halfway expected that from Hostile Skies
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:38:41 Hmmm, extra lift?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:38:51 Like, add more lift to the wings so you can fly with less speed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:39:58 So you're just going hardcore Andromeda?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:42 You have a bit of wiggle room Andromeda actually
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:58 You can probably add a tiny bit more wingage to the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:41:34 That's what I was suggesting
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:42:39 I've never used em
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:43:04 Eh, I like scifi, they don't fit scifi
general 2018-10-24 01:03:50 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 02:21:02 Why not magnets attached to ropes?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:16:31 Capture and show proof?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:18:26 Just show it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:19:28 Just freaking show it chilly, we don't care if it's pink, purple or freaking rainbow barf
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:19:38 What matters is the shape
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:21:28 Ehhhh, it's a really tough call, because he did make some iterations upon it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:23:02 I'd say he iterated enough to call his a branch, but not enough that he can call the concept his
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:23:31 So, in other words, he has every right to say "This current iteration is mine", but he can't say "This was entirely built by me"
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:26:54 Yeup, he's copying
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:27:23 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:28:19 If he tried to copy my fighter I would've kicked up a huge fuss, like I did earlier
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:37:33 Shut it, just, shut it, I'm Chinese here, now shut it ya racist fuck
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:37:47 That is way more offensive than you seem to give a fuck about
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:40:11 ..... <@!163143541160148992> , can you please take care of this racist fuck for me?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 03:40:50 You don't get to be sorry, you get to be burnt by the very people you fucking insult
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:09:27 Simply put AKaLi was pretending to be "Asian" and said random gibberish bullshit, entirely shamelessly, until I brought it up, and after that he still attempted it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:11:54 ...... Something tells me "ASIANS" are not welcome in this server <@!163143541160148992> , maybe they "ought to leave" before it gets out of hand (If you couldn't tell, the last part was with alot of sarcasm)
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:12:50 And yes, I am pinging you Empire, because this is fucking racist beyond any reasonable response or amount
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:13:17 ....
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:15:08 What grade of humiliating do you want? Minor, major, or "Get the fuck out of this server" humiliating? Because I'd imagine I can find plenty of proof that'll blast you to hell and back
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:15:42 Simply put, sneakers here decided to pick up the racism, whether intentional or not, of AKaLi
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:17:23 Oh, so you mean only your fucking "English" is considered true english?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:17:31 Grizzly, shut it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:19:46 .... Are you serious?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:19:50 Also, nice craft mahina
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:20:57 ... <@!163143541160148992> <@456226577798135808> <@!252094891448860673> , can one of you do something about this fuck before he harasses everyone out of the server?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:21:08 I am very much loosing my patience
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:22:31 How about I grab the biggest loaded "'Murican" shotgun, shove it up your ass as far as it'll go and pull the trigger until the pellets fly out of your head?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:22:48 Just submit it nearist, it'll go in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:24:12 Alright, I'll fight you with the fucking XM214 microgun
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:25:58 Something tells me he's not offline ... just pretending
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:26:17 I know these racist dumbasses too well honestly

creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:30:38 I feel like you ought to type your name out while posting the picture
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:32:12 What did I tell you guys ... <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:32:25 And the dumbass returns, for fuck's sake
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:33:11 You've mentioned it a bunch of time Future
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:35:15 How about you brand a fucking american flag on your eyes while you're at it?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:35:32 All the admins and mods are offline, unless Empire would like to CHANGE that
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:36:05 And that's the same? Not even close, someone can easily knock them off and burn them
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:36:32 Not really to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:37:35 .... <@!163143541160148992> , sorry if you're pissed about this, but until you actually come online, since you were marked as "online" the entire time, I'm gonna try to drag your attention to how racist this little dumbass is being, because it's GENUINELY pissing me off to high hell
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:38:08 Ahem, "liberated Chinese (insert object here)"
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:38:40 Infact, you know what, just to shut you up, I'm grabbing all the chats you've stated that are obscenely racist so you don't just delete them
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:41:02 Dragon, I already grabbed everything, plus he's too fucking stupid to delete his stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:42:04 Under which section?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:43:18 Incorrect, best defense would've been Article 1, which only protects you from Congress
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:43:55 Check and fucking mate, I know the Constitution better than you do, now get the fuck out
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:44:40 Alright, if that's a challenge, then let's see who wins, care to judge Dragon?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:45:32 Article 5 of the Constitution
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:46:54 He's trying desperately to look it up huh?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:47:01 To the person he motioned to on the first part
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:47:12 "**cool**, if you don't stop being a fuckin retard, get the hell out"
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:47:26 There's only one of us chatting right now that's got **cool** in their name
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:48:27 Article 5: The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:49:04 Not you nearist
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:49:14 You're fine
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:49:44 Either he backed off the challenge or he's trying to google shit and failing
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:51:22 Eh, well I guess now you know, I'm not entirely sure who was 100% first, but after looking it up it does seem like you plagiarized his creation
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:51:48 You can't just go "This was his" to the first person, then expect everyone to know that you got some reference from him
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:52:05 Safe to say he's noped out
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:52:35 I've got a fuckton of proof that shows he's racist, as soon as one of the mods comes back online I can nuke him
creations-chat 2018-10-24 04:53:15 Well chilly's offline for now, explain it to him when he's online
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:53:26 Lots of reverse jets keeping him afloat
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 04:54:27 Ah, cool
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:05:05 I'd say a vehicle or mechanism nobody has made before, but it has to be unique en- EMPIRE WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU AT!?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:05:33 Where, the actual hell were you at? Seriously, scroll up, or if you want I'll just hork out the important chat at you
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:06:02 I'd say both, but only if the vehicle's truly something someone hasn't made yet
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:06:33 Ah, that's a bad habbit, I thought you were actually online the entire time, hence the pings, which were for a relatively important reason by the way ...
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:07:48 Obscenely toxic
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:00 Like, I genuinely wanted to do the shotgun thing to him, toxic
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:52 ... Seriously Empire?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:08:57 Are y- are you actually serious?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:09:39 What do you mean "more" exactly? Did you see the fucking talk about communism and such?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:10:00 ....
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:10:08 You have got, to be actually, shitting me
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:10:47 Like, you have, y- forget it, I'm gonna decide whether to leave or not tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:01 If you're gonna side with a racist fuck, I may as well not be here
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:33 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:35 Hmm?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:39 HMMMM!?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:45 HUUHHHMMMMM!?!?!?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:52 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:11:57 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:01 
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:04 LITERALLY ALL OF THAT
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:13 Oh fuck I flooded creations, SORRY!
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:26 My bad! Didn't realize it'd do that
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:12:46 It'd still flood the chat, even in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:13:01 It seems to post whatever image is posted, regardless of where it's from, because I see stuff from <#384021699466756107> being grabbed
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:13:47 Just how, is that, sarcasm? Seriously, how the fuck, do you confuse that, with sarcasm?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:14:09 ...............
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:14:11 Empire
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:14:19 That is, t- ......
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:14:33 I fucking give up, I'm gonna decide whether to leave tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:15:13 Make this truly an "Asian free" server like you and him seem to want
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:15:27 Oh ARE YOU!?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:16:23 God, just fuck it, I'm not chatting anymore
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:16:36 What got in my head is the "Moderator" not giving half a fuck about it
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:18:42 And sometimes I think you don't deserve that mod role, but hey, we all have our opinions now don't we?
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:20:25 I'm doing it mostly because someone tried to harass me, and Empire's trying to pass it off as if he was just joking, you think he would've snapped out of it and realized I was taking him seriously at a certain point throughout all of that
creations-chat 2018-10-24 05:22:58 Because we all want it consistent in one place I suppose?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 05:33:44 Can't replicate for crap here, although custom stuff, well, I can pull up my fighters
bug-reports 2018-10-24 05:39:22 It saved many of my custom colors, only the engines got pasted into yellow again
bug-reports 2018-10-24 17:37:25 Any engines I painted blended into a sort of yellowish color, the same one you saw on the wing of my fighter
bug-reports 2018-10-24 17:37:42 So, the ones on the interior seemed fine, but the ones I had painted to blend into the hull turned yellow
help 2018-10-24 17:47:14 Center of lift's way too far back
help 2018-10-24 17:47:37 Add more wings near the front, or add more weight in the back
help 2018-10-24 17:47:43 You want your center of lift to be near your center of mass
help 2018-10-24 17:48:02 Or some more wings in the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:48:44 God dang it Rick, now all the exhaust flies out of my fighter so I can't cram hidden engines in there anymore, unless I cram them REALLY deep in the hull
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:49:17 Was that at me or at jekeri?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:49:28 Because if it's at me, well, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TURN THEN!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 17:50:06 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 18:53:36 Thank you Orange, apparently Empire thought it was sarcasm most of the way ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 18:55:04 Well at least you have some sense Orange, so I guess I'll be staying then
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 18:55:32 Seriously though, "Sarcasm", what the actual hell, like seriously
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:18:39 I'm gonna be honest, I am beyond pissed at Empire for not doing anything about it, and for trying to make it seem like it was okay
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:20:54 Long story short someone decided to start mocking Asian people as a whole, I called him out for it, seems like he was joking around with another person, then coolshirtsneakers decided to take it too far and start actively harassing me because I'm Chinese, mocking literally everything he could find about that stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:21:44 Just look in <#384025409945337856> ,I posted a ton of proof in there
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:22:00 It got picked up in <#504436696021204992> and got placed there
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:24:19 Also this, alot of it in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:24:42 And what does Empire do?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:24:59 
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:25:03 
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:25:13 That's what pissed me off to fucking hell yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:26:39 AKaLi0692, but he's fine, he knew when he fucked up and stopped relatively shortly afterwards
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:27:00 The one who truly took it too far was cooltshirtsneakers
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:27:50 Ctrl+F and look up "stop trying to act "white" by speaking english", that's where it all started
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:28:23 Well, not where it started, but where he started
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:29:49 You weren't online
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:31:00 Empire was the only one online, and as you saw, he didn't do fucking shit
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:34:11 Pick the creation you want to bring in to the arena, load it, then go to the arena
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 19:35:01 No idea then
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:07:03 For some reason I'm able to save the blue on my fighter, a 10,45,110, and it saves fine (You can TELL it's not any of the pre-set colors) on the blocks, so I'm not sure
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:15:13 How come my fighter's colors save then? I checked all the blues, they were so far off it's almost funny
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:15:36 I'll actually show you what I mean
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:27 
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:29 Tada
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:17:56 Why the heck does my fighter's colors save, yet everyone else gets some sort of error?
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:23 I mean, I had to repaint some parts of it, so
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:18:57 Meh, alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:19:36 Which channel?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:19:52 Oh yeah, that was at around midnight, not noon
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:06 It was brought back up at around 3:00 PM today though
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:13 Wait, PM or AM?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:27 What the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:36 
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:46 12:11 AM
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:20:54 Also, hi Flowride
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:21:37 RIP, we all have brainfarts
bug-reports 2018-10-24 23:22:01 Ah, that's good to note
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:35:15 Try to strive for something then
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:35:25 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:35:32 Wait, him or?
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 23:48:03 Submissions filters out stuff for a bot to drag it to creations, where the actual creations are at
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:03:45 Hey Imperial, question, how fast does it go?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:04:14 Well nobody made a flying appliance yet, yet he did
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:04:23 So appliances are already taken, flying cars are too unoriginal
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:04:48 Hey, before him, did you see any flying phones?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:04:57 Exactly
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:05:24 We've seen flying cars before
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:05:45 I think so?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:05:59 I have an idea for something flying, but I'm not sharing it with just anyone
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:09:08 Did he claim credit?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:09:25 Also, there's so few parts, I'm not surprised people copy or "copy" it
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:10:30 There's enough key differences that it's too dissimilar
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:10:45 Pay attention at the back and nose
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:11:09 That back "wing" is a big half block
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:11:44 Not to mention the base is a half block, he doesn't have a front nose, the front nose is made of glass, and there's 3 wedges instead of a central 1
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:12:10 Spooky, I'm side by side comparing these things!
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:13:01 Spooky, I had a copycat of someone trying to steal my superfighter before, you think I don't know how much it hurts?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:13:38 I'm trying to be 100% certain he's copying, but there's enough key differences and your creations are simple enough that he's likely not copying
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:15:37 THAT ONE seems like copying for sure by the way
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:15:58 The other one, yoe, his was too different
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:18:01 Meh, will do if I catch him
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:19:16 I found Yoe, he's not copying
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:26:12 I'm noticing it on my tank, if I rotate the turret to try to lock it between the front windshield, it gets stuck rotating downwards constantly until I move it to the side, or it glitches and flings it's self via physics instability
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:26:53 And I mean my tank tank, not push tank, which is a shame, because shoving the turret in a 1 block wide gap was actually what kept the turret very stable while moving
bug-reports 2018-10-25 01:27:41 Yeup, glad I don't use motors to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:28:38 I'd say creations under 30 parts are copyable, because anyone can do those, but above that, ask
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:50:44 I might revamp my current arena fighter to use the new rocket engines, but I'm not bringing my giant superfighter in there, it's too huge for it's own good, and the reverse thrust is crippled to hell
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 01:59:16 Oh by the way Imperial, how fast was the Concorde you made?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:00:30 OH WHAT THE F-
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:00:43 Excuse me while I replace all the engines, again ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:00:57 Save slot 9 ate my save
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:01:10 I'm using the super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:02:01 WHOAH camera controls are fucked up
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:06:29 Asking a mod to investigate this guy, I'm rebuilding my fighter and he goes and starts investigating it a bit too thoroughly for my liking
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:09:22 He stopped as soon as I deleted the fighter ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:09:43 
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:11:23 PARTS OF THE AIRPORT HAVE COME LOOSE!
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:14:05 I don't think he's copying anymore actually
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:14:15 I blacklisted him and he seems to have stopped
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:14:21 Question, does blacklisting hide you from other people or something?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:17:25 Eh, nah
help 2018-10-25 04:21:17 Mega RIP, not even close
help 2018-10-25 04:21:20 They're sinking devices
help 2018-10-25 04:21:31 Ballasts are things you ditch or grab onto to weigh yourself down
help 2018-10-25 04:21:57 In theory in Plane Crazy, you can set their weight to the minimum, which would be a flotation device, but you can increase their weight to massive degrees
help 2018-10-25 04:22:16 Infact, from what I heard, original single ballast blocks weighed about as much as a jet engine, which is pretty heavy
bug-reports 2018-10-25 05:09:02 I mean, it's close enough for now until we get new parts, imagine flying around with tungsten armor
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 05:09:13 Hello_gbug
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 22:36:13 Actually, it's 3 
......
00,000,000
help 2018-10-25 22:36:43 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-10-25 22:36:58 Take a guess why it spins with that knowledge
help 2018-10-25 22:38:45 Bingo
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:04:34 Obvious copying or doing a horrible job?
creations-chat 2018-10-25 23:05:13 Impressive
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:07:50 You can see the motors
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:07:52 Duh
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:08:11 Get a comparison Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:08:52 Oh, the bottom one's, yeah he's copying
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:09:03 By the way, nice job on the design
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:09:21 Like, that is undeniably copying honestly
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:09:56 Something tells me if the company thing passes, Xpert and Imperial are gonna be co-founders of supersonic passenger craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:11:36 My budgies (Parakeets) would like to differ
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:40:20 Uhhhh, how fast does it go again?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:40:49 The concorde you made Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:42:44 For the love of, god freaking
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:42:57 There, have it via private chat instead
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:48:31 https://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-9e7e4d8adbf0.gif
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 23:55:15 If you want to
creations-chat 2018-10-26 00:35:52 <@!313403326081531914> , it looks like a Starcraft Phoenix
<@!423484500891140105> , just post it, nobody will judge
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:15:12 You already have an answer to that: Helium
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:15:22 Helium is so buoyant, it floats in the air
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:17:34 Did you actually bother to adjust the weight of the ballsts, or did you simply set them to be as heavy as possible just to complain? Because if flotation's a problem, you literally have a block that's negative weight
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:19:12 So 10 - 4 doesn't equal 6? Good to know ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:21:29 I've tried putting helium along the spine of my MK1 fighter, I replaced 3 blocks through 4 trials, no replacement, 3 front, 3 back, both ends, and it flew exactly the same way all the time, just with a bit less weight the more helium it had
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:22:23 If you want critique, missing a turret, engines weren't armored all along them, and the head's more of a shovel-like shape rather than a box-like shape
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:22:29 It's overally pretty freaking nice though
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:23:42 It seems like a republic-era Y-wing, so you want the turret to be a ball turret (Or as much of a ball turret as possible), but if you want to make it the same Y-wing that flew alongside X-wings, you want to remove the armoring on the rear half of the engine pods
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:25:57 I'll get a pair of references for ya, both the republic era and X-wing era
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:26:34 I could actually see myself making it
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:34:37 For my latest design I went cockpit, fuselage, wings, and juggled between performance and aesthetics
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:44:30 Reactor?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:49:34 What do you mean by "reactor" exactly?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 01:50:40 There aren't even reactors of any sort in the game, so obviously he doesn't mean reactor as in actual reactors
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:54:19 It's slightly chopped off right now
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:54:28 I'll show you
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:54:39 Jarty, scroll bar
bug-reports 2018-10-26 01:55:22 
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 01:55:35 Look in <#498473314445033472> , that's what I mean by "chopped off"
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 02:41:22 AL?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 02:41:39 The heck is that?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:38:53 I checked, yeup
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:39:11 I brought my MK2 fighter in, shot someone to death, and it was still intact in another server
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:42:07 Check your center of lift and center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:43:03 You want the center of lift (blue) infront of the center of mass, but only very slightly
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:43:57 Wait, you haven't put on wings?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:44:34 Go for it
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:45:01 Uhhhh, save and reload, and drag the wings further forward?
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:45:36 Holy freaking crap ._.
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:46:19 I noticed based on the slight opening
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:46:46 Welp, amazing one
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:46:56 They should go up if you want them up
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:47:03 If it's auto control, use the mouse
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:49:33 ?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:50:41 It won't work well in the arena, but the color scheme and shape's nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:51:09 Simple: Shoot the rotor blade once or twice
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:51:39 Not to mention they aren't that fast, and they tend to be unstable
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:51:46 But outside of the arena, again, it's nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:52:42 Do you have your blue center of lift circle? If not, join another server
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:52:45 It's one of the vital parts
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:53:03 Also abc, with how fast stuff is, it's gotta be very durable and very maneuverable
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:53:08 And use mostly super rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:53:52 Trust me, they don't, they're very, very maneuverable, but very, very weak
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:53:57 Like, "One shot and you fly to pieces" weak
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:54:22 The fighter I use has a freaking armored to hell cockpit, don't even get me started on how well held together the actual body and wings are
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:54:45 And this was with old 1X2 panels, I can make it even stronger using 1X1 panels
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:55:18 Oooohhhhh, now I wanna see you two fight
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:55:35 Wait no we all know how that goes, TIEs are mass produced, X-wings are finely tuned
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:56:04 CoL's way too far back, you're using propellers for yaw, a few good hits to the front and you're dead
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:56:21 Ah, welp
creations-chat 2018-10-26 03:56:34 Also holy freaking, quit pushing the bar of quality for the rest of us Sn00p! I've already topped off
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:56:43 That's yaw
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:56:46 Left and right turning's yaw
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:57:19 What's it's turning circle relative to the building plot?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:57:48 Like, how long does it take to roll 90 degrees, and how large is it's turning circle while both pitching and yawing
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:58:03 Clockwise and counterclockwise
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:58:15 Oh you are SCREWED if you try to go in the arena with that then
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:58:43 Straight down?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:58:56 Too much lift in the back
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:59:05 Drag the wings forward until you pitch up
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:59:37 Ah, it's not the wings, you have a new problem
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:59:45 Your engines have too much thrust near the top
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 03:59:50 Think of it like a hammer
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:00:04 Thought it was really simple?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:00:24 Roll is simple, rolling on the ground, rolling a wheel, etc
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:01:08 For the love of, fine, hold on
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:01:30 Which server?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:01:42 Nevermind found you
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:28:41 For the love of, hold on ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:28:46 Let me just break his face
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:41:07 Can some mod get in here and ban this fucking moron? Mankilleg_TH, he thinks he's "pro"
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:41:19 When in actuality he's just trashing up the build areas with his shit creations
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 04:45:11 Not everyone knows about the blacklist, and he's getting into an awful lot of people's plots ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:04:47 That's actually pretty cool
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:20:44 Uhhhh, if you can get it flying that thing will be as armored as hell
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:21:40 Well, just scale things up
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:21:44 Rocket, they're stronger
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:21:46 Infact, super rocket
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:24:17 Freaking hell, good luck
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 05:36:23 What?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:48:47 Rick, how would heat seekers work exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:51:26 That'd be a bit overpowered in Plane Crazy without proper countermeasures, especially if they go really, really fast, not to mention it'd be really hard to avoid hitting allied targets (or maybe even yourself) if they're dumbfire
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:55:50 Sorta why no game on Roblox has done it right so far, it's such a fine line between "Completely nullified", in the case of the old MFS (Military Flight Simulator), where missiles turned so slowly that you were really lucky, or the target wasn't evading if you hit, or "Completely ruining", in the case of the current Neo Warfare, Basewars (if you flank your target), or Starwars Space Battle (Back when they tracked for 8 seconds, not sure now, haven't played it again), where it was nigh impossible to dodge missiles, and your only defense was either on a seriously heavy cooldown, or it disabled your maneuvering, leaving you vulnerable to guns
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:58:37 Ehhhh, make a testing server open to specific members, that way we can test them before they get released into the public, and if they need to be removed it won't screw up people's creations
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:59:04 Because I know for a fact I'm adding those things onto my fighters (Just a matter of how with a few of them)
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 16:59:36 Well, alright, with a disclaimer GUI stating that it's independent of the main place and that saves commonly break?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:00:01 I mean, presumably if features are appearing and disappearing on the test server all the time, save slots will commonly break
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:01:40 Then let's see how effective those missiles are (I have used them and been on the receiving end of them excessively on other Roblox games, because let's face it, I love flying, people get destroyed due to me, and people want to take me out)
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:02:14 Er, which server?
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:02:22 I meant I was going to try them out
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:03:11 Ah, nevermind then
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 17:22:16 Giant mega-runway that'll probably make the server crap it's self, similar to the Aurora
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:56:15 I personally say keep it in because Empire has some seriously wonky definitions of what works and what doesn't (Another heli-style of craft entered)
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:31 I mean, sorry for calling Robo out, but anyone notice some similarities in design to these?
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:37 OH FOR, ffffffff
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504630451579781121/505407980016107531/RobloxScreenShot20181026_174102916.png
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:57:46 The Osprey heli and this
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:58:09 .... I swear to god Dyno I am going to punch you
the-dump 2018-10-26 17:58:53 But anyways, he counted this, it's similar to an Osprey, so if you can get an Osprey-like mechanism on your craft fonkl, he has to count it in
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:15:46 I'm gonna just re-post my fighters, due to the new submission system and the fact that they might actually stay
Refitted combat fighter, built for performance above all else, with a shocking durability in Arena
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:15:56 https://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-7625720bfeb5.gif
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:16:18 Insanely maneuverable with full reverse thrust cappability
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:18:40 Hey, it's for performance above all else
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:19:49 My prized superfighter, built with aesthetics in mind rather than performance, although it's still not half bad when it comes to performance
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:20:43 Glides better than most VTOLs to be honest
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:21:56 When missiles roll out, I might use it as a missile platform or something
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:22:25 Because currently it won't win in a gunfight, but it's got enough lift and such that it can probably lug around anything short of Fonkl's space station
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:23:04 Fonkl, as much as I'd love to carry your station, it's too fat, even for this thing
creations-chat 2018-10-26 19:24:07 Also, if you remember the old design, you might notice a few tiny iterations to the nose
help 2018-10-26 21:23:25 Yeah, they've only ruined it for people that don't have literally hundreds of thousands of pocket cash
help 2018-10-26 21:29:15 I built a wall-riding turbo craft, but the issue was that blocks were one-shot at that time
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:50:03 There are ALOT of VTOLs sadly, you came a bit too late for them
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:50:19 Yes, even jet VTOLs
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 21:55:23 Hello_Panzer_Of_Spooks
plane-crazy 2018-10-26 21:55:38 If you're wondering why I say hi like that, it's a reference to Hello_world
creations-chat 2018-10-26 21:58:55 Nope, already made one, sorry
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:02:29 You know what? I'm throwing an idea down because I've not seen anyone do it, yet I'm too lazy to do it myself, rube goldberg device, go
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:03:01 Do literally anything via the most complex and convoluted way you can think of, with a single push/hold of a button
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:16 Hey, that freaking phone's amazing
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:22 So no worries about reposts
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:04:42 Actually, wait
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:05:32 The boat's cute so you get a bonus point from me
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:06:00 The save slot, post it here I suppose
help 2018-10-26 22:07:58 1 will fly better, 2 looks more interesting
help 2018-10-26 22:08:08 But I'd say 1, looks like it won't shake it's self appart
help 2018-10-26 22:09:05 Compare it with this
help 2018-10-26 22:09:08 FFFFFFFF
help 2018-10-26 22:09:12 God damn it, I'll just DM you it
help 2018-10-26 22:11:04 If you want realism, use 2, but fatten it up ever so slightly
help 2018-10-26 22:11:18 Because with 2, I feel like I could sneeze on it and it'd break
help 2018-10-26 22:14:26 Go with 2
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:19:48 I'd love to see someone make a combat sub
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:20:17 Well, I sorta mean like a fast, nippy little submarine designed for fighting stuff in the water, in the air if needed
help 2018-10-26 22:43:14 What's the main difference? The engine?
help 2018-10-26 22:43:57 Neo looks like it can cram more engines in, classic looks ever so slightly better though
help 2018-10-26 22:44:09 I'd say go classic for now, and expand to neo if you need to
creations-chat 2018-10-26 22:46:05 I'm pretty sure anyone can land on that, which is amazing
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:02:11 For the love of god, can you quit whining about everything? I have literally yet to see you start a conversation without it ending up either someone's kissing your rear or you're spamming caps, if you want to spawn your plane, go to the settings and set it to the slot you want to use
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:04:31 I'm not your freaking slave! You can work it out yourself if you don't care for slave work
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:04:35 Not even close ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:06:11 I SAID NOT LIKE THAT, for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:06:16 Put the number of the slot you want to use
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:06:24 In this case, LITERALLY PUT A 7 DOWN
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:06:26 THAT'S IT
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:07:23 Click off of it, don't hit enter
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:08:51 Then I don't fucking know, I managed to get my fighter working in the arena, that's the way I did it, so obviously you screwed SOMETHING up along the way
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:10:34 For now just make them your own, currently anything that disconnects that can hit something is to be considered a bomb
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:10:51 And quite frankly totten, I feel like not only should you be more intelligent, but you should quit begging for everything, I know you begged your way to inventor
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:11:01 Before I teleported to the arena ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:12:12 Then you don't have to play it, go play bloxburg or something if it doesn't make sense
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:12:30 VTOL, Vertical TakeOff and Landing
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:12:46 Then suck it up and get smarter and learn how to use the physics to your advantage
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:13:04 No problem Dave, look up the Harrier or F-32 for VTOL capable craft
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:13:23 The Osprey's sorta VTOL-style, but not quite
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:14:21 So? Anyone can build huge things, fuck, even I can scale up my fighters to stupid levels if I want to
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:15:44 Sure Dave
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:16:35 Not everyone's online, hell, I'm willing to bet most of the mods are effectively offline, just screenshot the upvote and resurface it later for the rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:16:54 Rather than ask repeatedly, begging for ranks like Totten did a long while back ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:21:33 I'm willing to scroll all the way back up and show you did beg for ranks Totten, so you'd better just let it slide
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 04:27:58 Xpert, but he's not the owner of the game
creations-chat 2018-10-27 04:56:42 Empire, for fuck's sake, give him it, we haven't defined what a bomb is, and if you want that logic, every single one of our fucking planes are plastic pieces of shit
creations-chat 2018-10-27 04:57:29 I did, "plastic crates being dropped from the air", either that's alot of sarcasm, or you're saying it doesn't count
general 2018-10-27 21:05:52 I used to have a strategy that won against everyone, but then the pattern changed and a new hidden boss came out
general 2018-10-27 21:06:22 Then Zeds became the new end-game and I lagged behind, massively, and I didn't want to bother shoving in the excessive amount of time to grind for the zed and the 5th slot
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 21:08:02 Shouldn't this go on <#497142796961054721> ?
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:02:51 Ballasts can be either heavier or lighter than regular blocks, which helps an insane amount
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:10:41 He tried to copy you?
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:11:03 Did you set those to the lightest or the heaviest Totten?
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:11:42 And as you can see they're about half as heavy as the regular blocks, at least if my very rough math isn't off
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:12:06 It's twice as buoyant, so assuming no changes other changes, it's about half as heavy
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:12:23 Why don't you try making your own game if you think this one's logic is crap?
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:12:49 Then quit whining about the logic in this game
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:13:11 "i love logic in this game", your rant yesterday, etc
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:13:34 If you want the glitches gone, find them, pull up the F9 log, and report them, or showcase a video of the glitch
plane-crazy 2018-10-27 22:15:56 Totten, if you want to be a developer, prove yourself, and I don't mean buildings or boats, I mean actual scripts, find a bugfix for one of the bugs there currently are that can be applied to the game, that won't make it shit it's pants, and MAYBE someone will think about you becoming a developer
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:14:10 It's a pretty decent creation to be honest
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:29:36 Here's a handful of suggestions I have to test it:
Start cutting off pieces of the wing on one side until it can no longer fly, that'll determine how durable it is (Be sure to disable autosave and to make sure you don't save the damaged craft)
See how little space it requires to turn around completely
How fast is it when going straight up, horizontal, and straight down
And finally see how little space it needs to stop/start
creations-chat 2018-10-27 23:30:01 That'll be durability, maneuverability, velocity, and acceleration
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:33:19 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:33:24 Like, show the save slot if you would
help 2018-10-28 00:35:29 Erhm, when you're finished here Orange, roles in <#504436696021204992>
help 2018-10-28 00:37:18 Serious, no offense but you were overreacting to that, you could've just gone "Can you please let someone else try to help? Thanks", and that'd be it
help 2018-10-28 00:37:41 Sneaky would've gotten that he/she wasn't helping, left you alone, and you wouldn't have had to have said those things
help 2018-10-28 00:39:22 If I get a say, I'd say the general reaction's direction was fine, but the severity of the reaction was bloated to unnecessary levels
creations-chat 2018-10-28 00:42:46 I'd personally say it's bombardier-worthy to, considering it's able to carry a respectable payload
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 01:50:46 Damn Josh, nice one
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:13:49 Josh, make an entire amusement park and I think that's an inventor rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:15:30 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:15:48 Runaway ferris wheel
creations-chat 2018-10-28 02:19:40 I see it has folding wings to
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:21:06 Ballasts to the front, helium to the back, adjust ballast weight to be maxed
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:35:28 Use engines or fins
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:43:51 Think of how real life boats work, I think that logic still applies to Plane Crazy, even if it's to a lesser degree
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:48:48 Let's see it?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:49:07 Usually I like to come up names when it's finished, rather than as it's being built
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 02:54:41 That'll work
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:07:58 No, at least not yet sadly
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:35:27 That's your STARTER!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:35:51 Holy hell, dude, keep on working on your creations, your starter's as good as my prized peak
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:36:12 The red and black one
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:36:41 Yeah, your starter looks and probably performs better than my prized peak, which I'll show you in DM to avoid spamming up the chat with it
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:37:24 Like seriously, if that's your starter then I'm pretty sure we're all screwed once you start working on your peak creations
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 03:38:52 Nah, you're being overly modest, it looks really freaking cool
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 05:22:39 Yeah, although you have to fit more than one rank in the first place
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 05:26:36 You may've wanted to readjust your keys, look in <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:52:31 Send that TIE-Advanced in <#504436696021204992> , it's pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:55:52 Not the interceptor, it's the TIE advanced
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:56:22 It's neither actually, the hell?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:58:19 It is not a freaking TIE interceptor, the body's different, that's how you tell
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:58:21 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwarsrebels/images/5/5b/TIE_Interceptor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161018184350
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:58:24 THAT is a TIE interceptor
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:58:36 Notice the lack of a back protrusion?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:59:12 I feel like I've seen it before, but at the same time it's alien to me
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:59:28 It's definitely got the body of the advance
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 18:59:44 Yeah, because the rest of us are hyping it up to other people, who are then hyping it to other people, and those that stay tend to stay for good
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:00:05 OH I REMEMBER WHAT IT IS, It's the freaking TIE Avenger
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:00:38 ._. damn Shemp, you got the wing panels very accurately
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:01:39 Build the turbolaser TIE prototype
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:02:34 This goofy as hell thing
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:02:35 http://www.modelermagic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WZ_TIE_M1_001.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:05:04 One thing I will point out: Is it just me or are the ratings dropping?
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:06:03 We can obviously see how it's floating ... You've got the engines set to not always on/off, so you can control the throttle, and since it's straight vertical, you can make it float
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:06:29 Hell, that's one of the first laughs I put my fighters through
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:06:51 Think of how a rocket works, then decrease that speed until you hit 0
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:08:31 For the love of god totten, some of the things (Not all of the things, SOME of the things) you find so novel and overwhelmingly amazing, someone's either already done, or it's easy common knowledge for the rest of us
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:09:13 I figured out stable straight vertical thrust before your most recent image, and hell, I'd imagine others have found it WAY before I have, even before all the fancy new parts came out
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:09:50 This ain't rocket science, that's what Kerbal Space Program's for
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:10:04 Good luck Whal
general 2018-10-28 19:14:24 RIP Fonkl
general 2018-10-28 19:16:22 It's the "Thing has stopped responding", but in what seems to be russian
general 2018-10-28 19:16:29 And it happened over his sound mixer
general 2018-10-28 19:17:00 "Press F to pay respects" here

plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:23:06 Right, let me try
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:23:14 Wings don't connect above or below them
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:23:18 But they do connect from the sides
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:23:29 Blocks connect at all 6 faces, but they won't affect aerodynamics too badly
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:25:23 Check your center of lift and where you placed your engines
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:36:57 He rolls a nat-20 and pops your helium balloon
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:37:32 But can you retaliate? Nope
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:45:45 Wrong guy ...
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:45:53 B-46, not B-29
creations-chat 2018-10-28 19:46:19 Center of Lift further to the front
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:46:57 It can technically be both Empire, even in this game
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:47:15 Just add some cargo space with some detachable bombs in the back and some magnets to launch them out
plane-crazy 2018-10-28 19:47:41 ... Once again, I give up reasoning with you Empire
general 2018-10-28 19:50:15 The warp drive rank was literally made because of magnets, how can you say they're NOT op?
general 2018-10-28 19:50:29 Like, even now they're still the fastest and most reliable way of getting stupid levels of speed
general 2018-10-28 19:50:42 Then go ahead and ban the people that got it for exploiting
general 2018-10-28 19:52:20 "warp drive is an **exploit**"
"of magnets"
general 2018-10-28 19:52:48 Then use something different, most people associate exploitation with hacking
general 2018-10-28 19:54:27 I know it has another freaking definition, it's just for the Roblox community's sake I'm thinking in a more simple-minded manner, because most of the general community are more simple-minded people
general 2018-10-28 19:56:33 .... I'm trying to put it in a way where you get it Empire, which is worse than dancing around what's effectively a minefield of words you either won't get, won't understand, will simply reject or something else
general 2018-10-28 19:58:27 Simply put, for most scenarios exploitation refers to hacking, so most people have sorta grown to it, at least on Roblox
general 2018-10-28 20:00:12 .... Forget it Empire, FUCK talking to you, like seriously, I can talk to almost any other person in this server, yet every single time we wind up in an endless cycle of you trying to prove you're right, and me trying to prove I'm right, with neither side willing to back down
general 2018-10-28 20:00:36 I'm not going to bother anymore
creations-chat 2018-10-29 02:05:08 Function > Fashion, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:05:53 You know what, I'm gonna tiebreak here, AEIOU, any of those will count now, go
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:06:26 There's an E, I saw that Juno
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:07:50 Hey, I'm tiebreaking it in a fun way, and since it's a tie between you two, and not me, well, I sorta dance around the rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:08:18 Orange wins
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:18:31 B2 spirit?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:23:46 ?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 02:28:48 ... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 04:55:55 Control surfaces, you need some vertically as well
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 04:56:16 If they're set to auto control, move the mouse, if it's set to manual, you want it to go up in the direction you want to go
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 04:58:15 Only way currently is motors, or chaining together wedges
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 06:19:50 Blame daveyorkzz
help 2018-10-29 13:35:28 George, you've gotta make a very unique building
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 13:42:54 I mean, there's a reason Robot Wars used srimecs
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 13:57:35 Roll or yaw tilt?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 13:58:11 Think of roll as rolling a wheel, and yaw as turning the wheel
help 2018-10-29 14:02:23 It's gotta have a unique quirk to it
help 2018-10-29 14:02:31 And no, turreted doesn't count
help 2018-10-29 14:03:08 A turreted planetary base doesn't count towards inventor, it needs to have it's own unique thing to stand out
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:03:35 Try using heavy weights at the bottom and helium at the top
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:03:54 It'll automatically try to default to being stable then
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:04:37 Bottom heavy, yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:05:42 Hmmmm, dunno how to help then
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:07:05 Apply what you did for balance and rotate it 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:09:02 Well, it's better than not being able to go anywhere except forwards and backwards, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:10:16 They have a miniscule amount of weight, but while testing at an old build and race place, any micro creations got affected by hats
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:11:27 Yeah, that's because you had very little margin of error
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:12:04 Meanwhile with something like my superfighter, that thing's got a margin of error so large, I could've thrown it against a wall (Assuming realistic physics) and still flown it just fine
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:14:53 It's the Millennium Falcon, of course it's gonna be op
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:15:25 Or is it a regular Corellian Freighter?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:16:09 Leo, better idea, make a jet that has a vectored engine
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:16:29 I still have yet to see anyone make a thrust vectoring system on their craft, and now with the reset and lock buttons, it should be alot easier
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:16:44 Thrust vectoring, like in the F-35
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:17:09 Rotating the actual engine to assist in turning
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:17:46 You can do everything from lightning fast turns to even VTOL landings with vectored thrust
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:17:48 But only if you do it right
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:04 Pffff, Dynamic
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:14 I can modify any of my fighters to do that
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:31 Dave, done, look around you
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:33 Dynamic
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:44 I can do that with this
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:18:49 Just requires a few tweaks
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:19:03 Infact, I've DONE it before, College classes though
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:19:09 What?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:19:43 Like, flying in reverse?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:20:10 Oh now THERE'S a challenge, get a craft that can fly over 400 speed forwards, and at least 100 in reverse, with full maneuverability both ways
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:20:31 You can't use motors
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:20:38 But reverse control
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 14:20:51 Anyways, classes, seeya guys
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:01:58 What's the mentality of rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:02:12 Like, how do they act/react/handle
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:02:56 Ah, sounds like small fighters are gonna have a field day, while larger ones are gonna be seriously brutalized
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:03:01 Any homing?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:03:31 Nevermind, RIP arena it seems
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:03:40 Small craft will get one-shot, large craft will get brutalized
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 17:03:56 Any countermeasures, or is it just go very fast?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 18:05:28 Welp, fonkl's a mad scientist confirmed
creations-chat 2018-10-29 19:30:18 Wheels occupy a 3 wide space, these "wheels" can occupy a 2 wide, or even 1 wide space if the user is clever
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:45:21 Orange, build a high-five machine that's simple enough for someone to replicate, then record a video of you and another guy high-fiving
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:45:34 You can build THAT, so I'm pretty sure you can do the high-five machine
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:46:30 Er, I meant like two flying ones
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:49:22 Well why don't you try making it then? You've got the design, you've got the idea, and you've got the tools
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:50:56 I mean, it's nebulous, basically it's gotta have some unique function or some REALLY unique look
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:51:34 Like, nobody made a large scale flipper bot before, so I converted my push tank (Tons of rockets + a srimec system) into a flipper tank
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:52:00 Judging from the force it had, if it actually worked, it would've probably have been able to launch anything short of a sea carrier into the air
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:52:31 Because it was enough counter-force to nearly flip my tank, which had enough force to literally punt 2K+ carriers around as if they were footballs
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:24 Too late, already made
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:43 You've gotta make one HELL of a flipper then
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:55:57 Because mine's got the horsepower of the push tank behind it, and that thing, again, can punt 2K+ carriers around
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:57:16 Oy, I'm only saying the horsepower, not the actual power, mostly due to Roblox physics
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:57:25 If Roblox physics worked, I would've been able to rage flip alot of people
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:58:33 Believe it or not Alex, it won't make it any stronger
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:58:52 It's pretty much at it's limit when it comes to strength
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:59:21 Nope, I already claimed the flipper, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:59:32 Oh, perpetual motion
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 19:59:40 No, Roblox physics are bad, but not THAT bad
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:00 Oh wait I think I just mad scienced a perpetual motion idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 20:00:21 Wait no nevermind, every action's got an equal and opposite reaction, warp drives work in weird glitchy ways
the-dump 2018-10-29 20:58:04 Whoever's copying whoever, it ain't gonna work
the-dump 2018-10-29 20:58:24 For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, so for something of that size to move, well, good luck
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:00:19 ... Seriously? Do I need to bust out my superfighter to show how insignificant that comment was?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:00:42 The pinnacle fighter so awesome that multiple people have tried copying it? Not just one little incident of copying?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:04:10 <@!217336009455566848> , <@!252094891448860673> , <@158294656113836032> , I'd like one of you to please wait on standby and monitor this guy in the event that he copies
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:04:55 From what I know it's bannable if you're caught
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:05:06 Basically if you copy, they'll catch you and ban your ass to hell
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:01 Erhm, sorry, it's just that this guy might copy me, and I DO NOT want that happening, you've seen what lengths I will go to with the last time, right?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:15 Anyways, now that you're here Super, you can watch over him, right?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:33 
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:08:37 
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:09:06 Ehhhh, you're one of the only people with power though Super
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:09:15 So if anyone's able to do it, well, duh
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:10:18 Anyways, what do you think of my pinnacle creation?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:10:30 (About the 5th time I posted it, sorry about that)
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:11:17 Extremely maneuverable, fully reverse-thrust capable, theoretically durable to no end, and able to clock at an incredible speed, all while having no assistance blocks such as ballasts or helium
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:11:59 Read it and weep ashp, checkmate
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:14:22 It copies the general wheel and frame design, but while it's not an original idea, you are very closely copying his design, too closely infact
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:17:24 You've just never claimed it as your own Super?
the-dump 2018-10-29 21:18:39 Oh cool, Brick Rigs
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:29:44 I think I know how, I'll run the theory with you Super
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:36:56 Gonna work on the supersonic craft eventually, but I'll need a warp drive plan
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:48:48 My computer can probably run it, it doesn't lag, even while faceplanting into Fonkl's creation
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:51:04 It's not quite as impressive, but it seems to be pretty punchy
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:52:13 Like critical damage
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:52:35 Let's say a majority of one side being ripped off, or the engines being torn to crap
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:52:38 Show a video of it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 23:52:59 ..... What?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 23:53:34 First of all, either Gamer's exploiting or he's bluffing, either way he's impersonating an admin, second, Merci and mcplays should be banned for hate speech
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 23:54:38 Potatoe, take a look at the picture and tell me, what do you think?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 23:56:24 As long as it gets the point across, I don't think anyone cares, even if he says cheese pineapples, as long as the point gets across
general 2018-10-30 00:07:55 GG, RIP Grab
general 2018-10-30 00:08:04 You entered the second dimension with your velocity
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 00:20:59 What do you want? Rick's the only one working on it, Mad's just sort of a spokesperson I suppose
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 03:14:30 Has Empire started a modern day fighter thing?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 03:14:45 Sorta figures
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:15:20 If you see what happened with the engines, you'll realize that that's pretty much an impossible task
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:15:32 We started with only jets and propellers, not even the propeller wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:15:37 Then we bumped up to rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:15:42 And now we have super rockets and large rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:16:14 Meh, I think that's a common complaint
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 05:17:23 Ask Rick on that, he's the primary dev on this
creations-chat 2018-10-30 12:59:43 So basically you have a forcefield Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 13:03:59 Hey calm down, seriously, I don't get what the big deal is with pings, you can disable "@ everyone" pings (GOD I hope I did that right), so only superpings (At least, reading over previous update logs that was a thing) work
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 13:04:09 How so?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 13:04:39 I'll join ya to try to record him
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 14:17:22 You could roughly make it, but yeah, agreed, it's way too effing round to be reasonably created
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:18:43 Heyo
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:19:05 Let's see what you made?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:19:31 One is your own, buuuut
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:19:45 Now you've got 4, discluding your own
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:20:27 Look in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:20:48 One of those votes were also your own vote, which, I personally don't count
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:20:55 Although, take a look now
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:21:39 
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:22:14 I sorta already did, take a look
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:22:43 Yeup, look at your ranks
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:23:04 Not a problem, always happy to help an aspiring developer
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:24:49 Why?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:25:51 Er, alright? 1: Wouldn't that go in <#497142796961054721> , and 2: Hopefully your screen will get fixed?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:26:00 Moving to <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-10-30 15:26:12 From <#384021699466756107> , seems like your screen's refresh rate got screwed up or something
general 2018-10-30 15:28:43 Might wanna lump up your chat a bit more, you're gonna get flagged by Dyno at this rate
general 2018-10-30 15:30:00 Pretty sure that's long, loooong overdue for replacement then
creations-chat 2018-10-30 15:35:23 I was about to say, "Earthquake simulator"?, That's pretty cool, using Roblox's actual glitchiness to make something like that happen
creations-chat 2018-10-30 15:37:11 I was gonna say "I wonder what'd happen if X crashed into it", but let's not
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 15:49:23 I'll see how they handle, test server?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:26:36 Hello_LegendaryMagix
general 2018-10-30 16:27:34 What the actual, hold on while I shout at Roblox, sometimes when I shout they actually notice, I think it's because I've met the actual developers a long time ago
general 2018-10-30 16:28:09 Ehhhh, I've gotten some things through
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:29:26 Future, look in the pinned <#491710474786832394>
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:29:46 TLDR for that: It's sorta hard-coded, Rick might remake it though to have larger places, but less players
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:30:04 Yeah, sorry, no larger places for now
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:30:13 But just use motors, people are 100% willing to overlook the usage of motors
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:44 Future, we do have actually viable VTOLs, but autonomous drones and such would be freaking awesome
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:32:54 ?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:33:26 Ah, responding to <#490306593242611742>

creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:33:49 How fast?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:34:02 Nice, block count?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:35:16 Mmmm, post the save file?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:35:56 Alright, give me a moment to check the ranks over now
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:36:42 I don't think it'll give you any more ranks, it's a nice build though
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:37:54 You can save it in a save slot or the autosave to check the block count
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:38:28 Ah
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:08 Give me a moment to run down the list, do the rest of you think it's inventor-worthy or nah?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:39:23 Also you'd better be right with the ~750 part
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:40:24 Unless it applies for inventor, due to the doubled land requirement you got advanced builder
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:41:51 Not yet
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:42:00 There's gonna be ALOT more quality of life things though
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:42:14 Not gonna spoil any just incase Rick wants it to be a surprise
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:42:20 But as you saw, pew pew
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:42:27 Well, you can rotate the rocket
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:42:56 I'm posting this in general so it doesn't get sucked into creations

creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:22 Got it?
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:33 So sadly you only get advanced, not expert
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:43:45 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-10-30 16:44:13 Er, well, whatever, either way works, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:44:52 As do other cannons, point?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:09 And can it move around just fine in water?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:33 Without firing
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:41 We're talking about Future's cannon
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:45:54 Fat and tired fingers, RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:46:05 The railgun
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:46:25 Turn it into a boat and I'm pretty sure you'll get lag machine
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:19 Alright, if you do, seeya until then chilly
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:40 Move, float, and not capsize
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:47:58 It ain't a boat if your deck dunks under the water with every shot, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:49:05 Can ya find it for the rest of us?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:49:43 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:07 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:32 Like, you have to take off planes anyways, you can't just spawn them in the middle of the air, so they'd have to take off, and if a plane can take off, it should be able to land
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:40 They'd be normal
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:52:45 It's the primary mode of transportation
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:53:01 Example: Tanks and cars have double requirements, but VTOLs and boats don't
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:53:34 Even if you have to drive the boat into the water (Which was thankfully fixed thanks to rick, thanks again!), it'd still count as primarily naval, because it's just a means to an end
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:53:54 You also need to fire it in the air, otherwise it ain't really a cannon, just a giant flying painting or something
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:55:09 C4RAB, try using ballasts underneath and helium up on the deck and bridge
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:55:21 If the challenge isn't to do that, use engines instead
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 16:55:30 Alright, just trying to help
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:00:31 Yeup, welcome to the world of mega creations
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:04:08 Alright, I mean, I think I have seen a few magnet/suspension cannons before, but that's just me
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:06:04 Try a suspension cannon that actually holds up the projectile before launching it, giving it a hovering effect, that'd be pushing it, but I'd say that that counts
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:06:55 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:07:05 What I was thinking was try making it hover before you launched it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:08:11 I mean, it's worth a shot, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:13 RIP, not original then, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:12:25 I was thinking you were using angled magnets to propel something at stupid speeds
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:13:22 Oh we're talking about the same thing, as long as the other person gets it, it doesn't really matter, right?
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:15:11 If you can make it refire and re-lock, that might count, although we'll have to see with the others
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:20 I can already picture a way to do that via magnets, so I doubt it'd count
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:33 Also, just build something, I've found that if you strive for inventor, you tend to hit a brick wall very fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:16:46 But if you build something, you're more likely to hit a unique niche that nobody has filled
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:17:47 Seeya
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:29:13 Then start doing it!
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:29:35 Nah, it's the people that do it
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:30:08 Use emotes, like this
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 17:30:31 Good luck, ask for help in <#478584971670454284> if you need to
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 18:04:47 Why though? That's like 5 extra steps for 1 thing
creations-chat 2018-10-30 18:05:52 I think I'll let the others decide on this one, not feeling that well right now
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:05:14 What do you mean exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:06:08 I see what you mean, you need to figure that out on your own sadly, Roblox doesn't exactly like smooth surfaces unless we create a custom mesh
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:06:22 So we can only provide you with as many tools as we currently have
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:06:32 Yeah, good luck though
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:07:00 If you want my suggestion, it's not a perfect fit, but use wedges to make an artificial curve
help 2018-10-31 01:08:01 For replicator, find a real life object, and create an in-game representation of it
help 2018-10-31 01:08:33 Example: Create a Boeing 747, F-16, M1A1 Abrams, or something else that appears in real life
help 2018-10-31 01:09:02 Inventor: Create something entirely new, something that nobody's seen before, a pretty tricky one, considering like 99% of things have been built, you might find a niche though
help 2018-10-31 01:09:28 Builder: Just build larger creations that serve some purpose, landlocked creations require double the blocks though
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:09:56 Yeah, apparently I'm trustable, which, if I'm not already, I'm going to try my best to be
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:10:29 Dude, Dynamic! That's the exact same tail system my second craft ever had
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:10:38 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:11:29 PFFF! Oh god, I predict your path now, you will make a tank, then take a brief hiatus, only to come back to see the community's exploded in size, popularity and creativity, and find new parts to mess around with, redesigning your second plane into solid block planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:12:01 Rocket, can you not please, people are genuinely sensitive about that topic
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:12:18 Thank you
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:12:55 He made a bad joke
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:14:01 Bad joke, don't ask
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:14:44 Meh, I sorta meant ground based turbo tanks, but alright
help 2018-10-31 01:19:18 Eh, not quite
help 2018-10-31 01:19:34 ... What?
help 2018-10-31 01:20:01 Ah, I thought you meant for inventor, for builder, literally anything counts, but if it's primarily land based, which your tank does count for I think, double block count
help 2018-10-31 01:20:33 Ehhhhh, what's it's primary use, in the air? Sea? Land?
help 2018-10-31 01:21:10 Well, it's not really a tank then, so I suppose it'll count
help 2018-10-31 01:21:25 Hey, my turbo tank rarely if ever flips, and that's because I'm just bombing across the terrain at max speed
help 2018-10-31 01:22:31 Yeah, it's easy to make a creation not flip, just make it very bottom heavy, a pyramid essentially
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:24:08 How so?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:24:31 Try un-blacklisting and re-blacklisting
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:24:44 If that doesn't work launch with an already made creation and leave the pad until he gets bored
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:25:19 Me? Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:33:29 Handling or visually?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:33:58 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 01:51:19 Show it in <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:00:23 Try using streamable?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:00:49 We're not sure honestly
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:04:57 Check the pins
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:15:22 Oh, fine, hold on a bit, it's just infinitely easier for everyone else if you use streamable, or a video to gif converter
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:17:34 I think straight vertically was meant Collin, although, mmmmm
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:18:22 I'll count it, you were at about a 45 degree angle with velocity to spare, so you probably could've done that straight vertically, if not, empty out the hull a bit and there you go
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:19:47 Nice, you know who the owner is?
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:19:58 Done <@365636270040416257>
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:20:45 Strap some rockets in it, attach a dixie horn, and I'll be happy with that RV
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:21:09 Ehhhh, sorry Crash, all I can say is good luck
creations-chat 2018-10-31 02:21:19 It'd probably hit many problems similar to the resizing tool to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:22:03 I will say, Lucia's little fighter/ufo thing looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:31:25 Sadly no in-game mods yet, saw what you typed in <#497142796961054721> though, show us?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:32:51 Well then
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:34:02 Let me just blast him off the face of the world
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:37:38 Push tank, that's what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:39:28 Make a variant that's a push tank
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:40:00 Actually, promise to use it with great care Imperial, those push tanks are very, VERY annoying and very powerful
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:40:47 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:48:37 Copier?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:48:57 Yeah, on my way, hold on, just tweaking my push tank
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 02:49:08 I'll make a shield refit in-server
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:00:46 All in favor or banning CrazyKevinP for mass rocket spam on neighboring builds say aye or upvote
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:02:24 Too late Crazy, once a troll, always a troll, and once logged, always logged
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:11:46 I saw it, it's like a real life truck actually, except the front opens instead of the back
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:12:21 It also doesn't rely on detachers, and can re-hook on
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:12:32 So, I'm gonna count it, if anyone would like to object, do so
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:13:56 Let's see NewDude?
general 2018-10-31 03:14:16 Lance, it's not similar enough to count as copying, infact, his looks horrible
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:14:37 Well, at least you have a gravestone for it
general 2018-10-31 03:18:30 Need me to come over spooky?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:30:54 As cocky as it sounds, I'm starting to be able to recognize potential trolls and other unwanteds via their icons on Discord or their clothing on Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:31:53 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:33:05 https://thewondergallery.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/not-giant-enough-letter-f.jpg?w=620
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:34:05 That's because they're a business, and a ton of people probably aren't using it
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 03:56:25 New update soon from what I know, quality over quantity, right?
help 2018-10-31 04:39:09 Which direction? Yaw? Roll? Pitch?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:32:34 I was about to vote no on that, but then I thought "It'd make precision taxiing alot easier"
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:33:11 Because I know for a fact that I've slammed into people's faces on accident while trying to move using only the actual rocket/jet engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:36:16 Like "Stick on teflon" levels of grip?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:37:54 Honestly, this might sound scummy, but maybe you can start monetizing Plane Crazy, not in the insane "Oh tons of skins and pay for exclusive win parts!" way, but moreso like a donations jar at the very least
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:39:14 I mean, if I had a bit of funding, I would've thrown a bit in already
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:42:27 That's pay to win, which would just make you seen as a scum for future games
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:44:20 Pay to win games do NOT hold, except if Roblox overly supports them, in the case of Jailbreak
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:44:46 Then you'd have to scratch special blocks to, and more blocks? Why would you, EVER need more than 1500 blocks without a bigger plot!?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:44:55 And bigger plots is hard coded from what I know
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 18:47:32 Ehhhh, still makes people a bit jealous honestly
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:45:28 You can't, Future, come on
creations-chat 2018-10-31 19:45:57 It's accurate enough from my perspective, although I'm gonna let the others decide since I'm still sorta new at this, and maybe a bit generous
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 19:50:13 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:34:51 What direction?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:35:44 Left and right is yaw, add vertical control surfaces, or if you aren't using auto controls, use rockets as well
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:36:08 Use the purple screwdriver to examine parts
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:36:15 For control surfaces, they should have an option for auto controls
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:36:25 Assign control surfaces to mouse control
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:36:34 For wheels, it adjusts their turning based on where your center of mass is
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:37:00 Then you have to rely on mostly mouse controls
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:37:21 Gonna just wipe that because of rule 9
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:38:40 ...
for empolics, you can use your mouse just fine, it works better at higher speeds, or you can use rotated engines
for kayden, what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:39:08 You haven't tried pressing R, T or Y?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:39:24 Sorry Tai, can't do anything about that particular kind of lag bomber
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:39:40 They'll just spawn and respawn it over and over again, so I can't barge in there with a creation to try to push him off
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:39:47 Emp, try it before saying anything else
help 2018-10-31 22:40:46 Mods can assign ranks to, let's see what you built?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:40:59 I meant while in build mode
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:04 They rotate stuff
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:13 Use the purple screwdriver to tweak blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:33 A rotated engine still gives force in that direction
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:37 And always on/off isn't a toggle
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:41 It stops as soon as you let go of that key
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:41:58 Example: I set pulling up to W, so as soon as I press it, I pull up using the engines, as soon as I let go, I stop pulling up
help 2018-10-31 22:42:36 Chairception, uhhhhh, that one's difficult to decide honestly, it's unique, but, hmmm
help 2018-10-31 22:43:02 I mean, it's unique as well, hence why I'm stuck on deciding or not
help 2018-10-31 22:43:06 I'll let you decide Super
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:43:44 Try using rotated engines to assist your turning
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:43:51 For many of my craft, especially at lower speeds, that's what I do
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:44:26 Set it to mentions only, infact, that's this server's default it seems
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:44:48 So we aren't pinging you, and even if we are you don't have to listen to the pings
help 2018-10-31 22:45:05 I vote yes, it's a novel idea
help 2018-10-31 22:46:37 Seeya, we'll probably have decided by the time you're back
help 2018-10-31 22:47:39 So, that's a yes then?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:47:49 Hello_AwesomeStar
help 2018-10-31 22:47:52 Got it
help 2018-10-31 22:48:13 If there was a third layer of chairception I'm sure it would've been a 100% yes to be honest
help 2018-10-31 22:49:32 I can see why he didn't, the top of the second layer must've been hitting the roof
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 22:49:45 Cool
creations-chat 2018-10-31 23:10:40 Looks nice though
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:34:40 You can
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 23:36:13 We've got test X and actual X
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 00:25:45 Check the <#501034677793193994> , and place it on a plane to see what happens, then think of how real life aerodynamics work
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 00:26:31 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 00:27:59 It applies to a limited degree
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 00:28:28 It's not gonna be the next flight sim, but at the same time it does apply somewhat
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:12:42 Er, does what count?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:15:51 Ehhhhh, what did you even use?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:24:13 1: Why did you make such a big thing and try to loop it!? ._.
2: It counts I suppose
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:27:08 Smaller craft are more maneuverable than larger craft, also don't build diagonals, use motors to achieve angles
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:27:14 Or delta wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:29:12 RIP potato
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:29:17 And possibly Tai
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:30:10 I basically pressure myself on remembering save slots
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:33:05 What are you going for? Inventor?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:34:20 For Jay, sadly there's far, FAR too many walkers already, many that work on all terrain as well
For Tai, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:35:45 Looks vicious, I like it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:36:13 Not actually that effective, but it looks pretty vicious
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:10 So essentially you've got modular armor, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:34 Sounds like my combat fighter, can survive about 80% damage, is stupidly maneuverable, and it's also capable of loosing balance on one side
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:41:25 Turbo tank, never flips, even when I force it to flip with rockets, turret acts like a srimec
help 2018-11-01 01:43:28 Use engines to assist your turn
help 2018-11-01 01:43:52 Control surfaces, they're way stronger at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:46:39 Er, <#497142796961054721> if you'd please
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:47:37 Thank ya kindly
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:48:59 Let's see?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:49:05 Er, ah, wait, nevermind
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:49:36 Save slots?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:50:09 I want to see the save slot so I can see the block count
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:53:25 The stealth plane mimics a B2, so I'll give you basic replicator for that, but otherwise sorry, no dice
help 2018-11-01 01:58:19 Stupidly fast?
help 2018-11-01 01:59:19 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 01:59:32 Done before once, I'm sure on this
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 02:18:54 Anything that drops "bombs", literally anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 02:25:07 He made a chairception, a chair sitting upon a larger chair, sitting upon a larger chair
help 2018-11-01 02:32:22 Your speed
creations-chat 2018-11-01 02:45:01 Cleaned it up, you're welcome

creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:23 Impressive, show it being built
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:44 Ehhhh, just record a video and use the converter in the pinned section
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:07:58 Dude, it's easier for the rest of us
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:08:02 F-12
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:08:18 Not half bad Dave
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:09:21 For Dave, oh yeah, definite improvement, even now
For ignac, I know that feeling
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:09:47 Ehhhh, I'll check it out then, why not? I've got time
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:14:26 Confirmed, it is a fully modular system that does properly equip
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:22:32 Did you actually put engines on?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:24:43 You need to add the main pilot seat
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:27:28 The heck? What do you mean?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:27:31 Like, flipping?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:28:16 Not enough lift? Too little control? I have no idea honestly
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:28:43 Hmmmm, ask around, this one I'm unfamiliar with
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:34:51 Wait, back or front flips?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:35:43 One side's imbalanced? I have no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:35:47 Auto controls are mouse controlled
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:36:02 The fuck!? I have, SERIOUSLY no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:36:17 Nah
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:54:40 I'll just give you a picture of what works
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:54:49 
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:55:22 This was made back in the day of jets, and has since been refitted, about 200 or so pre-refit
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:55:27 ~450 post-refit
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:56:27 The quirk about it was that it's stupidly maneuverable and durable, as it's a fighter, not an interceptor or strike craft
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:02 ... No, I don't
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:12 It's easy to make stupidly fast creations to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:20 Stupidly fast and controllable however?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:57:26 That's a whole other ball league
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:01:53 Okay, maybe enough with the hyperspeed pictures, we get it
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:03:06 ... Ahem, do you not see my rank tag?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:04:48 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:13:20 Well, nobody else built a modular car like yours
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:21:00 Igna, try making a whole series of modular parts for that vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:21:23 RIP, idiots will be idiots
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:25:21 Come on, I know Deception's a really good builder, helium and rockets aren't a better VTOL, and if you'd like to prove me wrong, I can do an unbiased comparison between your creations right now
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:25:42 Close enough, I'll count it New
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:26:07 You could've just done 1X1 blocks, but you did small, effectively warheads instead
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:27:11 Besides (For Xiy), if what I heard from Deception is correct, you basically insulted him, so think of it as karma
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:27:18 And I NEARLY forgot about that New
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:27:35 ?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:27:41 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:28:39 Why not integrate the designs as the handles themselves?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:29:20 Actually, improvement you can make: Make the handles able to jettison
creations-chat 2018-11-01 04:29:48 Alright, good luck
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:33:31 Already made, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:33:52 RoboRail's the first
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:34:20 Possibly, there's alot of boeing planes and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:36:05 Gotta be something VERY unique
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:37:02 Unique doesn't mean weird by the way, like the chairception
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:37:58 Well, yeah I suppose so
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:38:57 OOOOHHHHHH, this is gonna be hard as fuck, but make a plane, that can launch a secondary sort of suit, a- .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:39:14 Excuse me while I beat his face into his freaking ass for trying to lag the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:39:31 Then what the hell ARE you building?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:39:46 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:40:13 Xiyuse, delete it, NOW
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:40:32 Or so help me I'm getting the "You shall not pass" wall of "Fuck you", and blocking that attack on him with a god damn smile
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:40:55 And by the way, that wall blocks super rockets
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 04:57:58 Anyone object to removing him from the Discord?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:03:36 Can't, RIP, although I can mute him
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:07:50 So general consensus on muting him?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:12 Long story short he started rocket trolling people after he insulted them for making a supposedly inferior craft, even though it had no design whatsoever
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:24 At least that's what it seems to be from what I've read and have been told by Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:09:43 Hence the "You shall not pass" wall you saw
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:10:03 Can't, not within my power
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:10:58 Hence muting
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:16:19 Not yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:16:41 I'm just getting a 100% verification from the people, that way I don't mute someone for no good reason
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 05:18:05 The rocket box lines up, making fun of, that's a new one
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:14:52 Not me, I've only been adding or swapping out roles, not removing them
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:15:55 It's up to you ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:18:06 Two people today, one made a chairception that me and Superidra agreed upon was such a unique design that it deserved it, and the other made a modular building system, which nobody had developed before
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:18:34 A chair on a chair on a chair, literally hitting the roof
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:19:35 It was this
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:19:36 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478584971670454284/507323341917650977/RobloxScreenShot20181031_174125879.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:19:44 Don't tell me that's NOT unique
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:20:33 Yet it's a highly novel and unique idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:21:13 Not really, it's just that the bar for non-mechanics based uniqueness is set to a ludicrous height
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:21:33 I mean, have you seen any other inception type vehicles?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:21:59 Wait, so a car driving a car driving a car basically?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:22:36 Huuuhhhhh, well, ask Superidra about it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:23:07 I didn't exactly jump at it because I was wondering if it would count as inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 06:23:22 So, I talked with Super about it in <#478584971670454284> , he seemed to think so
bug-reports 2018-11-01 16:49:29 Updates come out when they're ready, rushed updates will always be bad, while ones given time may potentially be good
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 16:51:30 I know how that feels
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:09:16 One trick I've learned to prevent people from copying yo- PFFF, I see that Roblox logo immediately, nice one
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:09:49 But anyways, one trick is to have a huge amount of internal and hidden area, that way they have to guess what you did to make it work, and they REALLY don't like guessing, since, well, it's guessing
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:15:56 Think of it this way: Every single part they can see, they can copy, they can paint a rock to look like a pocket watch, but without all the internal cogs, mechanisms, etc, it won't keep track of time
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:17:15 Shooting doesn't damage in build mode, and even then, they'd have to remove the entire outer hull without removing any of the internal mechanisms to even have a hope of copying
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:58:53 C4RAB, either they're technically unique, or they're such a novel design that they fit
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 17:59:47 "Build a unique, never before seen creation. Creations must be 500+ blocks in order to qualify"
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:00:11 Hey, I'd love to get my hands on that thing and make it a flying chair so I can break it over someone's creation as a joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:01:02 Ffffff, Tai, you wouldn't mind stepping down so C4RAB keeps quiet and satisfied, would you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:02:11 C4RAB, look at how many people are in the server, then look at how few people have inventor comparatively, and look at how it's getting increasingly difficult with every iteration
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:03:20 C4RAB, if you want it to be a very novel mechanic, then push a suggestion in <#497865146266419200> to redo the inventor rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:04:42 Sorry yousuf, I've seen elevators before, no inventor sadly
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:05:37 So basically a trap yousuf?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:06:06 Make a mine layer that deploys cages or something, I doubt anyone's made a mine laying ship
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:07:03 Don't tell me that's NOT mechanically worthwhile C4RAB, because one form of explosives are coming out soon, so mines would be useful for naval style combat
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:07:42 Magnets attract or repel objects on your own creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:09:21 Just petition to reset the freaking inventor rank in <#497865146266419200> then! If it's that much of a problem that more people are being recognized instead of gunned down immediately, then petition against it! This isn't a dictatorship ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:10:09 ... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:10:57 For the love of, you know what, I'm not dealing with this, I see you're online so <@!252094891448860673> , I'm sticking this on you, sorry but I can't deal with this, not while studying for a test
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:14:25 So, do we count THIS as inventor <@!328598467972956160> ? Because I know inventor has to be the most unique rank of them all with some hugely practical application for making something fly
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:14:59 I would've counted it because again, never saw a domino reaction before, 500+ parts, and it's a novel and, what seems to be 90% functional idea
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:15:19 But I want your opinion on this, since you seem to be the main one that'll say no
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:18:31 Don't quote me on this but if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that's halfway what made him loose the mod rank, he just shot down everything that didn't agree with him, this is just a guess mind you, so it might not be true at all, either because that's not the reason or he didn't actually do that
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:18:56 Moving camera parts to <#491710474786832394>
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:20:33 yousuf, move it to <#491710474786832394> please
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:21:27 Sadly no
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:25:08 That I can agree with Super, but at the same time you did agree on that one guy's invention, didn't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:14 How about this, if we vote for uniqueness based on looks, it needs to fly with a ratio of 1:100 helium, that way it's very difficult to build weird and wonky things
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:24 For every 1 helium there needs to be 100 blocks basically
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:26:52 The way we'd be able to tell is via the build menu
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:17 Example: 500 block creation, they should have 1495 helium blocks left to build with if they're playing by the rules
creations-chat 2018-11-01 18:27:50 Eh, I'm gonna go for classes, so bring it up with Super
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:35:42 Why not split it? Inventor rank 1 and rank 2?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:35:51 Rank 1 would be unique look, rank 2 would be unique mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:36:15 Rename the current one to artist, create a unique looking creation, name the new one inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:36:37 Yeah there's one issue C4RAB, many people will have deleted their inventor creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:38:57 Again, make 2 ranks of it then, 1 for unique designs, the other for unique mechanisms
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:40:33 Well it's better than drenching the current rank in gasoline and burning it down! At least some recognition's made
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:41:15 DAAAHHH, FINE, do what you want, nothing's going to convince you anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 18:43:05 Anyways, classes, seeya
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:57:38 Totten, what you described seems the opposite of fair to me
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:59:15 No offense but more people might take you seriously if you spelled things correctly totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 21:59:54 Anyways, I think contests are fine if you put a thing in <#504718138399522832> stating what to look for
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:00:09 Example, tell the community "Judge these creations based on X, Y, Z, A and B"
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:01:17 How about a freaking compromise then? Judges have stronger votes, worth 3-4 people's worth of votes, and they get their own exclusive numbers to use to tell them apart, that way if the community disagrees entirely with the judges they won't succeed
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:01:51 That's what totten's suggesting with his judge pannel
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:30 You're suggesting a group of people having absolute control over the votes and who wins
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:02:44 Also holy effing crap the chat's active
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:04:00 Ello brick, need anything or just saying hi?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:04:41 Hello_Frysco (One of these days someone will get the joke)
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:04:57 Totten, type it all out instead of just one at a time, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:05:24 How about a mute instead of a ban Xpert?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:06:12 I'd prefer not to answer if I have to, but at the same time if you really, really want me to, I'll answer
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:06:41 Not you totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:06:50 We're talking about in the event that someone spams the suggestion channel
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:07:10 We're talking about nobody right now, just incase someone does start spamming up the channels we're preparing
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:07:33 Because it's an inevitability that, since this is a Roblox Discord, we're going to have the occasional troll or piece of crap roll in and try to ruin the whole server
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:07:54 So we're plotting out preemptive measures in order to make sure that if it happens, we minimize the effect, if we don't outright stop the effect
help 2018-11-01 22:08:24 What do you mean exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:09:28 A slowmode would basically prevent your style of typing from happening you know
help 2018-11-01 22:11:12 A scissor type of gear?
help 2018-11-01 22:11:16 Like those scissor lifts
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:12:07 Do suggestions-submissions and suggestions-discussions actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:12:15 Submissions has slowmode enabled, discussions has slowmode disabled
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:12:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:12:28 Then I don't know
help 2018-11-01 22:14:17 Wait, why does the landing gear come out that way? Doesn't it come out the other way around?
help 2018-11-01 22:14:34 Like, so it doesn't just buckle like it seems to do with your craft, instead the drag causes it to pull out even more
help 2018-11-01 22:16:11 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:20:38 It's a built in part of Roblox totten, seriously, I'm working with 2 other dev groups and both have faceplanted into that limit before
general 2018-11-01 22:21:45 It's clickbait for sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:22:25 I'm pretty sure the Roblox servers would implode if you did that Super
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:23:45 Not unless 80% of Roblox petitions it or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:23:53 And even then that'd probably come at some reduction of something else
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:25:21 I think most of the inventors are recent ones
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:26:02 Make a turret and a drill if you can
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:26:13 Do you realize what that's gonna do? This is at totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:26:59 Trying to save stuff to the hard drive, if I understood you correctly, meant accessing the person's computer, which is a huge security breach
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:08 Also alright Igna
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:44 AGAIN, accessing the person's computer ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:27:56 Wait wait wait wait what?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:28:05 F THAT CRAP THEN ._.
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:30:01 I'm just gonna clean that up now that we've seen it
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:30:50 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:31:02 Riiiiiight, that escalated quickly
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:31:08 You okay spooky?
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:32:47 Right, igna, could you please try to make at least a partial effort to shift? I don't mind, but others seem to seriously mind
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:33:35 Welp, alright igna
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:41:30 Probably took it to the Roblox chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:45:26 Make it fly and be able to legitimately hit someone and I'll be impressed, not inventor impressed sadly due to the recent things, but we'll probably be impressed nonetheless
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:51:17 Me when missiles get added in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:51:18 https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1457265578248117678/5DE7612051D964960012EF0259DB5B6BEAEBC1A0/
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:51:28 ... Seriously? Oh come on!
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:52:36 Trying to find one without a tag on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:52:55 ... Thanks, I guess, although the "child" part's a bit insulting
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 22:55:04 I'm gonna burn out and crash here, I'm doing like 10 things right now, seeya
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:56:29 Wait they don't?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:00 Ah, so someone can be master builder and lag machine?
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:19 Er, wait, nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:57:23 I don't know, I'm tired
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:28 Future update, currently out in the test server
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:43 And those things are nasty little suckers
creations-chat 2018-11-01 22:59:53 At least, if they had homing, thank crap they don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-01 23:01:15 You can't photoshop something that accurately in such a short amount of time without an existing angle ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 00:44:33 If you can rotate them, yes
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:03:08 Can it rotate those engines to a more forward position? It'd count for prop master I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 02:07:35 You okay Orange?
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:32:37 Well, ehhhh, not quite the VTOL purpose
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:38:10 Bozo's creation
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:40:58 Ehhhh, give me a quick moment, I'm really feeling sluggish today
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:41:35 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:53:39 It's gotta be controllable, so sadly no
creations-chat 2018-11-02 02:53:56 Everyone seems to forget that part
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 02:56:26 Meh, not that surprising believe it or not
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 02:56:34 And it's not Orange's idea, it's literally a pinned message
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 02:57:26 Isn't it free?
creations-chat 2018-11-02 03:05:22 How many blocks?

general 2018-11-02 03:07:40 In Plane Crazy, you don't NEED one, but they're very nice to have
general 2018-11-02 03:08:40 Eh, this is technically on-topic, but try using engines for all directions
general 2018-11-02 03:09:13 I don't think so, ask Xpert when he's on, he isn't on right now so don't ask

plane-crazy 2018-11-02 06:44:54 Well I just killed the push tank trying to help, RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 06:45:18 I'm just gonna, probably take a break for a while
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 19:36:07 What do you need me to test?
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 21:08:34 Check em out in the test server
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 21:30:24 Dave, he's human, let him do what he wants
help 2018-11-02 21:42:03 What about make a pistol? Like one that actually works based on recoil
help 2018-11-02 21:42:18 Doesn't have to be based off of any real life ones

creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:49:57 Ehhhh, what do you want for it exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:50:07 It's just a creation doing pushups
creations-chat 2018-11-02 21:50:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 21:54:07 Simply post a picture of your creation in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 21:54:19 Tada
creations-chat 2018-11-02 22:31:37 How many blocks epic?
help 2018-11-02 22:44:00 Wait, Xpert, I know what you can make
help 2018-11-02 22:44:07 Like, aside from the fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 23:56:49 Overambitious, it's not going to be able to fit
plane-crazy 2018-11-02 23:57:44 The build box is literally too small for such a project, especially if that's only 1/4th of the size
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:10:39 Very bland, like, excessively so
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:33:04 From <#504630474853974032> , Not everyone's awake 24/7, hence why it's good to get mods both early in the day and late at night
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:34:10 TOTTEN, for the love of god, you don't need to list out literally everything, it gets irritating
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:34:20 THEN DM ME
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:34:36 DM me the list and it'll stay around, because nobody else will talk in there
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:35:06 Testing new update
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:36:04 G'night, and if you can find the test server link, sure totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:37:04 Again, try finding it yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:38:28 Don't troll on there or else I'm gonna swing in and blast you with the ban hammer Grab made, except it actually works
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:39:00 Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:39:38 For testing purposes, rockets seem to work on other people
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:39:44 TOTTEN! Remember what I warned you about
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:39:52 That's why I warned you to not troll on there
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 04:40:12 AHHHEEEEEMMMMM, if I hear you're trolling on there, so help me
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 06:05:43 We have alot of carriers, but at the same time carriers get ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 06:09:47 Why not a carrier focused fusion?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:27:24 Hey, you made little "lights" on the wingtips, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:27:33 Although the center of lift needs to be further forwards
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:32:57 Simply put, put fewer wings on the tail and more wings up front
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:33:05 Or you can try to shift the center of balance back instead
creations-chat 2018-11-03 19:33:23 Either use ballasts (These require guesswork since they don't affect the center of lift for some odd reason), or increase the back's weight
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:13 We always had a test place brick
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:29 Fair warning: Missiles have damage enabled
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:36:34 So DO NOT abuse those, got it?
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:37:14 If you want I can try dogfighting with you with the missiles
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:37:21 I got a pretty vicious craft for that
bug-reports 2018-11-03 19:38:13 The saves will save, but they don't connect with the main game
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 19:40:39 Try showing the F9 log
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:14:21 Testing server
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:15:07 You have to land on a ship I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:25:57 Creations-chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:26:06 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:26:54 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:27:09 It flies, it's over 2K blocks, that's Lag Machine worthy
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:27:58 Give me a bit of a break alright? I'm back from being sick (and tired as well)
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:28:30 I think straight vertical Res
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:28:51 I'll give it anyways, not in the mood to scrutinize
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:29:38 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:29:56 On it, just give me a moment
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:30:11 GIVE ME AN EFFING MOMENT jesus christ today's not a good day for me
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:30:34 How well does it fly Obs?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:33:04 Done, now excuse me while I throw up a bit (not really)
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:33:32 Show it doing the various stunts in <#473249376223887371> and I'll rank you then
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:34:46 Use something to make it easier to read please, I don't want to have to scan the video incase of a virus like I've had to do so often
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:34:56 You could've used streamable, but that's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-03 21:36:44 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:38:11 Then sadly no, doesn't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:38:40 I mean, there's no difference in flight patterns in testing, as far as I can tell
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:38:53 So if it counts in testing, it should count in the actual game
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:39:01 Ah, nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:39:07 Parachute ain't implemented yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:43:24 Okay do I need to start bombing him? Because I've got a freaking good bomber in the test server
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 21:44:23 RIP
creations-chat 2018-11-03 22:32:27 Back, let's see?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 01:33:48 Already been done, so no, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:45:09 Show me the helium block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:46:02 Use the hammer tool, place down a single helium block, and let me check the count
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:46:11 The reason why I say place down a single one is because it updates after you place one down
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:49:40 Check the <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:50:44 You don't have a master seat then
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:50:56 You can repaint helium blocks you know
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:51:13 So show me the block count, use the hammer icon, and if it says anything other than 1500, I know you'll have placed a helium block down
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:51:20 The main pilot seat?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:51:49 Well, 1499 if you place a single one down
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:52:10 And the reason I ask to place one down is because again, that updates the value, which can glitch sometimes, so instead of showing how many you have, it'd show 1500
creations-chat 2018-11-04 02:53:10 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:53:17 The heck? Huh
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:53:25 It's the one where you only have 1 of it, correct?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 02:53:45 Then I have no idea why it isn't working
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:11:45 Try to keep that in <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> please, if you want I can clean it up for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:12:24 Thank you Tim
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:12:37 So, any creations you wanna show off?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:13:00 Try it in <#504436696021204992> , a bot will automatically bring it to <#384025409945337856>

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:14:27 I accidentally saved over my push tank, so
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:14:48 Alright, how many blocks and are you applying for anything else?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:15:00 Ehhhh, again, can't do anything, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:15:28 I can give you various ranks from the <#473249376223887371> category if you show the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:16:56 No new ranks, sorry Diamond

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:19:49 Spooky, ahem, <#490305554556911646>
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:20:36 The joke it's self is the issue
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:20:54 Nah, I'm fine, I don't like nuts anyways

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:24:11 <#501059272675688468>
creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:27:52 Record it, used Streamable (check the pinned messages) or whatever program to turn it into a gif or something, and I'll rank you for it

creations-chat 2018-11-04 03:35:08 Bit stubby for a type 7, but I'll count it considering this is Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:38:31 A train that takes the rails from behind it to construct the ones infront of it
help 2018-11-04 03:38:37 There is

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:44:16 Well, if it's any horizontal movement
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:45:01 Ballasts at the bottom, helium at the top, engines underneath for movement
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:46:49 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:53:20 How many blocks was it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 04:58:27 I'd apply, nobody's crashed me yet, not even smacking into Fonkl's creation bothered my computer

creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:21:42 Take a picture of the save slot?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 05:22:47 Because of the helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 05:24:37 You need to control it once at that speed
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:24:53 Thank ye for that
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 05:25:02 Good luck
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:25:35 Honesty and honnor, that's how
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:26:17 First, bombs, then you get bombardier for that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 05:26:22 Second, how about a tank?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 05:27:12 Imperial, little tip: Engines cut out, control surfaces go AWOL, no mentions of anything else
help 2018-11-04 05:27:26 Center of lift's too far back

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:03:59 You know what? I'll bookmark it with a yes, but we'll probably review it with everyone available later
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:04:14 Again, BOOKMARKED
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:04:30 This can be removed at any time without warning mind you, so don't let it sink in too much
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:04:41 But at the same time, you can control the direction, somewhat
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:05:01 So, you have some degree of control, and it goes a crazy warp
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:05:11 Anyways, I'm off, goodnight
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 06:06:01 Just remember, you're up for further review from the others, so you might not've 100% done it, but who knows
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:44:47 Use motors Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:44:59 Use motors and make it fold upon it's self
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:00:39 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:06:14 Dear freaking GOD PEOPLE, GIVE ME A MOMENT, sorta dealing with a few things in life right now
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:06:42 Land based creations are doubled Tim
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:06:53 And you've already got expert
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:07:31 Do we count warp drives as engines?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:08:19 There, everyone's requests are done
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:08:38 Now excuse me while I continue recovering from being sick
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:09:06 The magnet drive that 126tank has is what we call a warp drive
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:09:43 Ah, read over the <#473249376223887371> carefully
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:00 Specifically in builder/lag specialist
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:44 Yeup, also, well in that case, why not?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:10:51 Oh wait you already have it
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:12:48 It's his "blimp"
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:13:04 He's trying to out-size everyone's creations with one of his own basically
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:13:44 Hey, it's what he calls it, not me
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:16:47 Simple, 100+ block creation that goes over 500 speed that's completely on the ground without anything from the engine tab (Apart from wheels of course)
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:17:53 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:21:46 He uses magnets, which aren't an engine, to propel himself along the ground
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:39:06 Dragon, can you not? Like, seriously, that causes alot of fights
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:41:26 They repel and/or attract objects, how do you think a magnet works?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 19:42:23 Ask someone else that, I'm not familiar with them myself, specifically ask to build a warp drive, people that have built those magnet thrusters will understand what you mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:57:36 Just submit the pictures and/or videos in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 19:59:14 And currently a bit of a sick one, so I might be ever so slightly touchy or slow
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:00:38 Send a picture of the save slot if you would?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:01:54 Missing a tail fin and some vertical wing tips, so it actually looks more like a dual rotor huey
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:02:26 Although, ehhhhhhh, hmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:02:47 There's a thing on the right that says who's a mod and who isn't, and many of the more active mods are on right now
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:03:14 If enough people upvote you, you'll get replicator
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:05:38 That won't get anything sadly, too small
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:05:47 Check <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:06:18 I mean, aside from that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:08:51 It's, not really impressive to be honest Games
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:09:12 Like, unimpressive for combat, for balance, for speed and, basically everything except firing angles
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:09:25 Also cool oslo
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:08 fonkl, I'm pretty sure everyone's seen that
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:22 And let me just say that's a bit ambitious in terms of size, but still
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:10:36 Well have a bucket of attention from me then
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:12:07 Double requirement for land based vehicles
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:15:23 Rule number 2, do you mind?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:15:55 We have mod logs, sir
help 2018-11-04 20:21:55 From <#491710474786832394> about magnets, attract and repel pull and push respectively, when you hold down the key, they do what their name states
Toggle means that instead of holding down the key, you only need push it once and it'll turn on
Strength is how forcefully the magnets push or pull
Range means how far they affect blocks
Loose blocks means anything they're not attached to, when they're on, they only affect blocks they're not attached to, when they're off, they affect every block ON YOUR CREATION
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:25:33 No, that's called copying, and if you don't have permission, that's plagiarism
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:26:15 Can they take off in it, or is it just the creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:26:17 And is it a large one?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:28:52 Easter egg
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:29:11 Well, here's my suggestion: Have internal components that can not be seen from any angle
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:29:22 That way if they do copy, they won't understand the internal mechanisms
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:29:33 So they'll create "copies" that fail to do anything aside from flop around miserably
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:32:05 Do you realize how difficult that is with particularly large creations?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:32:13 I mean, pulling up my superfighter as an example
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:32:21 
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:32:27 Think of just how many engines are inside that thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:47:29 Did you have internal mechanisms in the Zero?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:47:56 YEUP! As I expected
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:48:38 Insert generic exploding on runway noises here
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:55:24 Tank, let me see how many helium blocks you have
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:55:38 Place one down in a corner or something and let me check the count
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:55:50 Also let me check the engines
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:56:05 HOOOOLD ON PEOPLE I'M TRYING TO DO LIKE 50 THINGS!
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:57:17 Now the engines tank?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:57:29 Collin, use propeller wings, not the propeller engine
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:58:12 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:12 Er, I already gave you the rank tank
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:16 Also that's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:22 I can see there's no engines already
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:30 There's no place to hide them
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:41 And since there's no place to hide them, they're all on the outer hull
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:59:46 And since there's none on the outer hull, you don't have any
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 21:00:05 Okay I'm taking some me time right now, back in about 20 minutes
creations-chat 2018-11-04 21:07:24 Eh, still on me time, post it and I'll rank it later if someone else doesn't rank it
creations-chat 2018-11-04 21:08:16 That's more like a fighter than a ship, post the save slot?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 21:08:40 You know what, nevermind the me time, the server's calmed down a bit

help 2018-11-04 22:04:45 Then I have no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-04 22:04:59 Just wanted to show off the awesomeness?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:05:24 Then make your jet have internal mechanisms to assist flight
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:05:33 That's the number 1 way to stop creation theft
creations-chat 2018-11-04 22:06:18 Ah, alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:31:25 Ello, don't mind the storm going on

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:36:26 We have enough problems going on
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:36:34 Now please stop with this type of chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:37:08 It's a touchy topic, so please don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 22:37:31 .... Close enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 23:03:30 Like a block wheel?

creations-chat 2018-11-04 23:29:15 Alright, also what are you going for gamer?
creations-chat 2018-11-04 23:29:50 It's like an RV, except flying, I like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 23:30:12 Motors, as many as you want, then  add various blocks, wedges, etc
creations-chat 2018-11-04 23:30:33 Just leave it be Empire, think of it as dialect
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 23:31:23 Well, look at other wheel designs
help 2018-11-04 23:36:01 You mean the main pilot seat Empire
help 2018-11-04 23:36:15 The main pilot seat determines your spawn point, so you need it in order to spawn in your plane
help 2018-11-04 23:37:21 Yeup
help 2018-11-04 23:37:25 Happens alot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:26:47 Can you actually take half a second to read <#473249376223887371> instead of just shouting, unlike in <#491710474786832394> ?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:27:08 Then what does it say for engineer?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:27:39 Fucking hell, let me drag it over for you and highlight the important part
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:28:14 
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:29:06 .... I fucking regret this after what happened in <#491710474786832394> , but
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:30:00 Just keep quiet before I change my mind and give you the muted role instead ya blockhead, I'm gonna remember that for a looong while
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:30:28 Which one's propeller master exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:31:41 How the hell does that thing fly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:03 It shouldn't be able to fly, and yet here we are
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:15 Also, if you want to get ranked on it Sam, send a picture of the save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:32 NOT YOU, LUCKYSAM
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:32:51 For fuck's sake, READ FOR ONCE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:16 "Also if you want to get ranked on it __**SAM**__, send a picture of the save slot", you aren't Sam
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:25 So I wasn't talking to you Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:33:52 You're allowed propellers so long as they don't assist in flight, but I'll count downwards propellers as assisting flight, downwards rockets however, not so much
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:34:01 Mostly because you can inverse jet engines and propellers, but not rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:34:57 What is it igna?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:35:55 Yeah, the steampunk rank
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:36:44 Primary reason I'm imposing it on these two is because after the fucking fiasco nuke in <#491710474786832394> , I've entirely lost trust in them, namely because they didn't listen to THE ENTIRE SERVER TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING, even Superidra at one point
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:37:38 It's safe igna, you make freaking creative things, so
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:37:52 That someone was a fucking yesman that you probably paid for
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:39:21 Are we seriously going to start another argument at this point?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:40:14 HAH! GOOD LUCK, but seriously, even if you were someone else I would say "Good luck"
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:40:25 The last few inventors were seriously pushing it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:41:07 Folding, already done, hydrofoil, already done, not a new mechanic
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:43:17 Missile truck done, and for Dragon annoyingly DMing me, spring launcher, done
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:43:23 And don't worry igna, you did unique stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:45:30 See why I'm pissed off with these two igna?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:06 Yeup, all probably done already, so I'd suggest just giving up, you need someone with actual creativity and not a yesman to do it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:14 And if you think I'm being rude, just, ask Super what happened
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:46:37 I don't want to go over it again, it just, it hurts mentally
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:47:36 Don't worry igna
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:52:26 Firearm's already been made, Empire made a rifle with a bipod that works
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:52:45 Also, show a picture cake?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 03:53:55 <#501059272675688468>
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:56:59 For the heli, so that way we're able to see what's wrong with it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 03:59:38 OH! You're that one, huh
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:00:10 Lack of stability at the base? I mean, those are some seriously large blades with alot of force
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:03:15 Already done and already done, neither count
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:05:50 Variable-incidence?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:07:21 Ah, already done, many of the VTOLs in Plane Crazy do so
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:08:53 Did you dooo, what?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:09:36 Sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:10:57 Well, I think they're close enough honestly
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:13:05 Done, not possible with the mechanics and done boymah
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:13:59 Post the picture on what you have so far Dragon, I doubt it's original
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:24:23 Let's see then
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:25:30 Sorry to burst your bubble but nope, just not with landing wheels
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:25:56 Someone did it with blocks and wedges instead over a larger interval
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:26:39 But it's the same thing as the other guy's mechanism ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:27:09 If you paint a horse black and white, it's not a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:27:54 Dude, you're literally doing the thing I said and making a horse a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:28:40 Fuuuckiiing HEEEELLLLLLL, DRAGON, IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:28:53 .....
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:16 Back when inventor and modeler were fused together, we gave someone the rank based on chairception, a chair on a chair on a chair, because it was very unique
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:21 This is neither unique, nor is it the first
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:29:56 Cake, make the body heavier, you've got alot of lift and not alot of weight
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:30:24 Well, that's all I can see cake
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:30:34 Expand the body outwards
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:31:14 Also, Dragon, my analogy will still stand, a horse painted black and white is not a zebra
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:32:17 ..... Dragon, you literally just typed out it's not unique right there
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:32:29 "it does __**THE SAME FUNCTION**__ as other contraptions."
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:33:30 Tank, I'm not giving him the most unique rank of them all, primarily since I saw someone do it before
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:33:58 And he's claiming that just because he replaced wedges with blocks and blocks with wheels, it's suddenly a new creation
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:11 Also, I was about to say someone else made a truck, but then I saw the patio
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:17 Connected by a rope, niiiiiice
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:34:51 I'm tempted to say inventor, but again, most unique rank of them all
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:36:09 Something tells me Dragon's whining to the other mods that I'm not giving him inventor, even though AGAIN I HAVE SEEN A GEAR MECHANISM BEFORE
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:37:44 It is fucking not Dragon, I have seen a gear mechanism before, and that is BY FAR a gear mechanism if I have ever seen one, JUST WITH WHEELS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:03 IGNORE THAT I AM TIRED AND ABOUT TO THROW UP WITH SICKNESS, so forgive typos
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:30 Yeup, a Ferris wheel and everything
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:38:43 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:39:49 I think that falls under rail based systems
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:40:15 That was one of the first fucking things I saw ropes be used for ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:40:49 Fucking hell Dragon, how ELSE would you make one!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:08 A magnet slingshot? Nope
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:24 People already made slingshots of all caliber ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:41:55 Banned, that's what Turismo
creations-chat 2018-11-05 04:42:05 No seriously it counts as lag bombing
general 2018-11-05 04:45:21 Seems like we have a firearms expert here
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:01:30 Wait I saw that somewhere else
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:02:43 Dragon, shut it for the love of god, you don't help
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:03:50 Oh, you are the rightful owner Turismo, nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:04:20 Can you clear it up? It seems like you're flipping statements alot
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:04:38 Do you mean "you did kinda start it, not to hurt your feelings" or "You didn't start it"?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:05:48 I just need clarification on that
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:07:18 TLDR boymahi, Dragon wanted positive and negative magnets and a catapult system, both of which we repeatedly showed evidence that it wouldn't improve the system, to the point where even Superidra got involved, and it turned into a very heated argument because Dragon ignored everyone except himself
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:07:48 And I nearly got the greenlight to bring down the hammer and just, basically tape everyone's mouth shut, just so people could try to defuse the situation
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:14 If a part 2 starts I'm taping everyone's mouths
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:27 HOW THE HELL IS FONKL STARTING IT!? HE'S WARNING US THAT IT'S ABOUT TO START SO WE CAN __**AVOID**__ IT!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:08:51 ... Keep Fonkl out of this, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:09:37 .... Dragon, boymahi needed a TLDR and I gave him a TLDR of what the fuck happened, now I'm putting the brakes on this, and if you keep on blaming me, then who's at fault exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:11:39 For the love of fuck Dragon, my patience is up with your incomprehensible stupidity, and absolute refusal to understand that the ENTIRE, **GOD DAMN SERVER** __**WAS AGAINST YOU**__
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:12:00 __**NOW SHUT, THE ACTUAL FLYING FUCK UP, AND TAKE A HINT**__
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:12:19 Seriously, THE ENTIRE SERVER Dragon, ENTIRE, SERVER
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:13:01 Sneaky didn't get what he was getting into, Scooby I'm willing to bet you paid or something, and even then that's 3-5 against 10-15 or something within that region
general 2018-11-05 05:13:15 I do
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:04 ... I'm about to make an executive decision here
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:35 Fonkl, boymahi, will you two back me up for, at least temporarily muting this guy, so this argument doesn't happen again?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:14:50 It's not a permanent mute, just long enough that this topic passes
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:15:17 We're all LOOSING OUR COLLECTIVE SHIT AGAINST YOU DRAGON
general 2018-11-05 05:15:39 I'm actually relatively bot-free recently
general 2018-11-05 05:15:45 Seems to be when you play games they jump on
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:16:39 Dragon, I can visualize a "new" and "inexperienced" player's view, easily
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:17:12 Dragon, can you please just shut up and read what WE HAVE TO SAY FOR **ONCE**!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:17:55 Okay that's it, fonkl, boymahi, will you both back me up on muting him?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:18:28 .... Welp, alright, I'll follow your cues then fonkl
general 2018-11-05 05:18:47 Yeah, the more active you are on games, and the more popular the games, the more bots you get
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:19:15 DragonMage, for fuck's sake, the complexity is the appeal of this game, if you saw it a few years back, you would've thought it was destined to fail
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:20:12 People don't go on this game to play Bloxburg, they go on this game to build a vehicle with loose aerodynamic physics that can operate to their preference
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:24:55 DragonMage, you are, 90% wrong on that, why do you think some suggestions are upvoted that change game mechanics, and some aren't?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:13 Because those have actual REAL THOUGHT put in them
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:25:36 Plus that's a good point fonkl, this is Roblox, not Unreal, Unity, Frostbite or whatever AAA engine you're requesting
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:26:01 This is Roblox, it's held together by duct tape, sticky glue and spit, and yet it's held together
general 2018-11-05 05:26:29 Eh, maybe after a certain point? Don't know
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:29:00 I'd pick the magnet, see the menu and go "Oh, repel, attract, I know what that does", meanwhile I look at the other two and go "Uhhh, how do these interact?", because while attract and repel are simple words and easy to understand, synonyms of pull and push respectively, the interactions between positively charged and negatively charged blocks is still being investigated by scientists to this date ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:31:17 Dragon, I'll take the one block that attracts AND repels in an, yes unpredictable, but reliable way
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:31:46 Oh wait, did I describe the current magnets? I believe I did
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:33:12 ... Dragon, I think you've got the right descriptions, but knowing what you're talking about, you're talking about the wrong ones
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:33:27 Boymahi, good point, I'm gonna add something to <#491710474786832394>
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:34:29 Magnets sound more appealing
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:34:48 Because they're so prevalent in the real world, even as KID TOYS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:36:36 "Buggy": Fixed in the next update, infact, probably 90%, if not 100% fixed, and the rest are Roblox engine bugs
"Unpredictable": They can be narrowed down to become predictable, and even then, their only unpredictability is when you jam a ton of magnets together
"Complicated": How complicated is PUSH, and PULL, exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:38:27 Doesn't counter my point, their primary function is push and pull, people understand what it does, and when they find something novel, like magnets, they don't just go "I don't understand what this does!", they fiddle around with it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:38:51 And if you aren't old enough to understand what strength and range mean, then no offense, but get the fuck off the internet and go back to preschool
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:26 Have you seen anyone else complain about the magnets except for their lag, which has already been fixed by next update?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:40:47 People don't care that range is very nebulous, they see it, then they realize the potentials, so they're willing to trial and error it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:41:36 And that's gonna be solved by your "solution" how?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:41:57 If anything it'll be even less viable to use magnets if they were only positive and negative
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:42:20 Actually, thought of a point that your idea has, but you haven't iterated upon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:24 I already posted that suggestion mahina
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:43:27 Check <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:44:19 You know what Dragon? I'll literally do a survey right now with people to see if they'd rather have the current magnet or positive vs negative charge
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:44:31 If you so refuse to see that the second mechanism is ludicrously complicated
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:45:32 Doing the survey
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:48:26 So far people say they like the old magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:54:38 General consensus Dragon is that the current magnet system's far better
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:06 I did a fucking survey on this stuff across multiple servers of multiple people playing in-game, some of which have barely built their first plane before taking a crack at the magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:09 .......
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:11 Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:14 Shut it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:18 Just, read what I said
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:25 And read each and every single word I typed out
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:56:52 I took, A, SURVEY, ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVERS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:57:08 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-05 05:57:32 Dragon, literally the people you claimed weren't going to use magnets, the people you claimed that would benefit, PREFER THE NORMAL MAGNETS
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:04 ..... Just, shut it Dragon, everyone's sick of your bullshit
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:10 Me in a literal sense
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:00:54 He hasn't jumped in yet
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:21 ..... When everyone that's involved is tired of you, I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet to claim that everyone else that jumps in, unless you paid them to be a yesman on your side, will agree
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:02:49 TLDR Future he wants to add positively and negatively charged blocks and we've repeatedly shot down his suggestion, to literally the point of doing a fucking survey that disagrees with him
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:05:41 That hasn't exactly stopped anyone now has it?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:07:23 The only possibility I can see is sifting out garbage, so hopefully if it's added it'll sift out you
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:08:22 ... You fucking can't read can you?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:08:55 I'm out for a while, just gonna throw up from stress
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:11:44 "COOL"!? HOW IS THAT FUCKING COOL!?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:13:40 ... You are one sick person, and not in the good way
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:14:08 I'm tempted to ping Rick over, but I'd rather not
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:15:11 <#384021699466756107> I suppose
creations-chat 2018-11-05 06:15:22 Also, Dragon, you're the one going against the 95% group consensus, even with a survey ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:16:26 That's inevitable Mahi
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:17:15 Can't do anything until in-game moderation's added
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:18:27 UHHH, that's very, very touchy, so I'd say yes sneaky
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:18:43 There are people to this day that I've talked to that have had fucking PTSD moments thanks to that
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:19:20 ... 1: How is that funny sneaky?
2: Are you sure you're feeling alright?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:20:16 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:20:41 Can you please at least shove it in <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:21:17 Thanks sneaky, I mean, still touchy as hell and I'm wondering if the others would be fine, but at least it's not front and center
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:22:40 ... Don't answer him until he reads
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:24:25 The hell!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:26:08 ._.
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:26:18 I can not bleach that from my eyes now
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:26:30 God damn it Deception! Why you do this?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:30:10 I'm gonna just sign off now, fonkl or whatever mod is still on, you're in charge
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 06:30:23 I need to sleep, especially after having to deal with Dragon's crap ...
help 2018-11-05 13:03:55 Use folding, that's been the universal Plane Crazy solution to limits all the time
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:08:25 Madness, I don't think I've seen a revolver yet, specifically with a rotating mechanism, yes I've seen a firearm, but not an actual revolver cylinder
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:10:09 You might have a shot at inventor depending on what the others say, although I'm leaving it to the others
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:10:29 I don't doubt it's capable, what I'm questioning is whether the others agree or not
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:05 Eh, I'll leave it up to cook, but if he gets it, he probably gets inventor for a revolver-esque reloading mechanism
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:38 Post a picture?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:11:48 Like of what it's modeled after
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:12:29 Due to new systems, you need votes as well to apply for replicator
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:06 So in other words basically a zombie apocalypse truck?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:32 Oh wait, I think I see that side drill thing
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:13:36 Storm chaser?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:14:26 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:15:15 I would've gone with a canceled out rocket engine to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:16:03 Don't forget, pictures appear in <#384025409945337856> when posted here, no matter what type, but I'm cleaning up after ya, don't worry
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:17:59 Hey, that's the best part of this game, the most pro of the pros and the noobiest of the noobs can happily coexist together and help eachother
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:18:23 Er, like very few games, what's considered a "dying breed" of games
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:19:29 One question, why does everyone base their creations off of real life stuff? I know it's easier to picture, but it sorta gets samey to be honest, even if you pick something unique like a storm chaser
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:19:44 Also, nice KSP jet for your icon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:20:24 Oh, if it's from KSP, it's probably a space something, so when I say KSP jet, I probably mean space jet as well
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:22:34 Try making something unique actually, like once the storm chaser's done
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:22:56 Pick a design or two you see off the internet, and don't just copy it, but iterate upon it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:23:13 I mean, you've had to have done it alot in KSP, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:24:53 That looks as uncomfortable as fuck to fly in, but I like it because it's so unique compared to what I see mostly, namely with the glass bulb cockpit
creations-chat 2018-11-05 13:26:25 I can already see how to do that, infact I can see how you have infact already done that, but alright, it's still unique
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 13:26:43 That thing is tiny, stunt pilot ranks at best
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 13:27:15 I mean it's cute, and probably pretty hard to hit, but with such a low block count, sadly you probably won't get any of the really big and shiny ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:03:19 God damn it ignaciel, save some for the rest of us!
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:04:21 Now make a fighter, I wanna see your innovation be put into an actual plane
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:05:53 Knowing you you're gonna make the Intrusion 2 Grabber and punch someone in the face
creations-chat 2018-11-05 14:07:19 Heh, god damn it, now I feel old and behind with my fighter, it's a big and beautiful design sure, but it's not innovative in any way whatsoever, the only saving grace is probably that it's as durable as a flying brick of steel
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:51:38 Unique design with 500+ blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:51:43 Not mechanic
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:52:18 He had to split inventor and modeler down because they were blending together too much
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:52:25 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:52:51 Well, it's a creation that looks entirely unique to other creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:53:11 Like the chairception, fonkl's Aurora, my superfighter, etc
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:56:20 It's gotta be unique, so I don't think a washing machine would work
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 14:56:31 A flying one with a spinning interior however, that would count as modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:12:18 What the hell is that even supposed to be?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:12:51 So in other words, modular plane building?
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:13:17 Build one and launch it, I'm tempted to say ignaciel's got modular design already down, but we'll see
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:14:14 Tiny planes have an advantage of maneuverability, so if it can't get ace and novice pilot, discluding the speed limits, well, I don't think it counts
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:15:07 Dragon, if it doesn't build a working plane, it's not original, in the slightest
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:15:33 I'll debate it against ignacioel's modular vehicle system
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:17:25 I just realized it's not actually a modular plane builder ... Those 3 planes in the back are prebuilt
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:18:22 I'll settle it when I'm back from classes, but so far I'm leaning towards "no", since ignacioel's was literally hauling huge sections onto an empty frame, yours is just tacking on stuff to a pre-built plane
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:18:56 And that's if it doesn't shake it's self appart, because of a lack of re-couplers in the current version
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:19:53 Yes I am being vicious about it, but this is one of the most prized positions out there, so I'm going to be brutal and a half about it
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:20:20 Read the <#473249376223887371> , no helium for scientist ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-05 15:20:47 Classes now, seeya
help 2018-11-05 17:38:20 It is actually pretty bad believe it or not Dragon ... Primarily because there's so little armoring on the motors, and your missiles are only ground based
help 2018-11-05 17:38:39 Also, there's a glitch called the warp drive Obsidial, I'm not saying how to do it, but the warp drive rank was made because of it
help 2018-11-05 17:39:57 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 17:42:41 Gonna take a Terraria break until 2:30ish, ask the other mods or admins (if they're on) for ranks or moderation help
help 2018-11-05 17:49:10 Experiment, that's the fun of the game
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 19:57:21 
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:10:21 Look in <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:24:16 <@!217336009455566848> , sorry to bug you, but do you have time?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:26:08 We've got two rocket trolls
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:41:17 Cube is infact in the 'Cord
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:55:39 I have a problem because you trolled 2, possibly more people in the testing server with repeated rocket spam for no reason other than you just felt like trolling
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:56:18 Even ashp is now at least SOMEWHAT controlling himself, rather than building those abhorrent rocket spam vehicles
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:58:31 Again, TLDR they were trolling on the test server with rockets, although I'm willing to relieve ashp because he's no longer spawncamping people via rocket spam cars
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:59:31 
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:59:45 So those two trucks aren't loads?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:00:07 The issue is is that the rockets pass through blacklist boxes
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:00:23 So even if you blacklist them Super, you can still blow their creations to pieces
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:03:33 Yes, and they ignored me
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:03:53 And I saw everyone else complaining about lag and spawn camping, although the lag I haven't had a picture of because it got flooded out, sorry about that
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:04:53 You never camped me because my design was able to launch immediately
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:05:03 Fanta, ashp is off the hook, so leave him alone, he's at least partially shaped up
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:06:47 That would've been me ashp, mostly considering you were trying to hit people with the missile platform, namely without permission
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:07:11 I'm just gonna do circles with my fighter right now to be honest, if someone starts trolling again I'll gun em down
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:08:53 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:09:22 Just do a loop with any craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:13:00 The whole point of the test place is to test how things work, not just to spam someone in the face
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:13:22 The whole reason Rick made the rockets work outside of the arena is for ease of testing
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:16:43 Either it's legitimate, or he's modified the craft's performance
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:16:59 Cube, quite frankly they were all similar colors, what did you want me to do? Judge them by their streaks?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:17:34 ... I saw white and grey in the mix ya moron
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:18:48 ...........
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:19:19 Both of you break it up, Cube, I saw plenty of white and grey in that mix, and things slightly smaller than 2 blocks as well with rocket trails
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:22:09 I'm saying "Fanta and Cube, break it up, to answer your question Cube, I saw plenty of white and grey in that mix"
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:22:41 TLDR fonkl cube and ashp were both trolling via rocket spam on the test server, so I join in to try to stop it
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:22:52 No thanks Fanta
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:23:22 Ashp's at least partially reformed by controlling himself and not spawnkilling via rocket truck anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:25:26 I responded to this
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:25:50 I see cube and ashp shooting people
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:25:59 And so, guess what I do?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:26:17 ... I'm talking about at the time I arrived
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:27:34 "Building a plane", the picture says alot, a rocket car with as many rockets as you can cram on
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:27:40 
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:29:19 Ashp, if Cube would just drop it and at the very least apologize to the others after what happened, or try to push the blame on whoever was truly being annoying, instead of actively trying to put me down through various ways, well, I wouldn't have to stop now would I?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:29:45 Alright then Xpert
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:30:42 ... How about anyone that wants to get involved ask and I'll invite them to a big group chat where we can debate this out
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:31:04 Or, nevermind, group DMs don't work that way
general 2018-11-05 21:32:26 When I see you submit this Cube, I take it down
general 2018-11-05 21:32:31 Specifically for that last part
general 2018-11-05 21:33:11 I don't give a damn about the rest, throw all the hate at me you want, yet I will clean up the server of any shit you throw, especially with the second to last word
general 2018-11-05 21:36:03 Then you shouldn't have abused their ease of testing ability
general 2018-11-05 21:36:11 There is a reason arena guns work only in the arena
general 2018-11-05 21:36:22 And that's to prevent people from shooting towards other people's spawns
general 2018-11-05 21:36:51 I can literally give you something so we don't have to expect anything from you
general 2018-11-05 21:37:15 Rick's not at fault because he enabled it FOR **EASE** OF TESTING
general 2018-11-05 21:37:29 For trusted people to **TEST** how the rockets behaved, without having to jump to the arena constantly
general 2018-11-05 21:37:57 Ashp, if you read closer, he's warned because of all the threats and such he lobbed at me
general 2018-11-05 21:38:15 Such as the most recent shit I had to clean up, aka: This
help 2018-11-05 21:38:47 Pfff, is that the infinite loading thing?
help 2018-11-05 21:39:32 It is, heh, well RIP
general 2018-11-05 21:39:57 And then at some point it got so excessive that he had to call for someone to help
general 2018-11-05 21:40:23 And lo and behold, when I join what do I see? A bunch of ground vehicles lobbing rockets at whatever they please
general 2018-11-05 21:41:41 If CJ was shooting, he wasn't obviously shooting, meanwhile I see you rocketing from spawn to spawn lobbing white rockets everywhere
general 2018-11-05 21:43:03 Because of one reason: He's not targetting anyone
general 2018-11-05 21:43:32 He's supporting you to extremes Cube, but he's not really targetting anyone, which is what makes him in the clear, meanwhile anyone that tells you you're wrong cube, you just lash out at as much as possible
general 2018-11-05 21:43:52 If you want to prove you're not wrong and that you're innocent, you need to PROVE it, not just lash out at people
general 2018-11-05 21:44:54 Do you think I'm dumb enough to delete evidence around other mods when there's a mod log that keeps track of what's been deleted?
general 2018-11-05 21:45:07 Ashp, don't drag yourself into this ...
general 2018-11-05 21:45:47 Pay attention to the 3 points I marked
general 2018-11-05 21:46:10 Tada, I HAVEN'T deleted any evidence you've posted, because you haven't posted any
general 2018-11-05 21:47:03 It's a screen shot that's captured the link that you posted, you can't click on it, but you can see it's a link that leads to a video
general 2018-11-05 21:48:01 I'm telling ashp not to drag himself in because I don't want to have to damn ashp to the same fate you're in
general 2018-11-05 21:48:31 Sorry about that Super
general 2018-11-05 21:48:46 TLDR I was responding to this
general 2018-11-05 21:49:15 I witness rockets coming from ground vehicles, I track one down until I see cube and ashp on two of them, the primary two I see blitzing around to lob rockets at people in the test servers
general 2018-11-05 21:50:13 So I ask them to stop, and while ashp has some degree of sense and stops, to a certain degree, cube proceeds to, what can only be described as harass me, in <#384021699466756107>
general 2018-11-05 21:50:21 And here we are now Super
general 2018-11-05 21:51:54 For the love of god, Xpert, can I mark these two down for harassment, again? Because that is seriously uncalled for
general 2018-11-05 21:52:21 Every bit of evidence you post can and will be used against you Cube
general 2018-11-05 21:52:54 The most recent one, observe the bottom
general 2018-11-05 21:54:46 I'd suggest you'd stop, but then again I'm itching to get permission to ban you fools
general 2018-11-05 21:56:08 Right, I've had enough evidence to make an executive decision, you're not just bothering me anymore, so this is getting out of hand
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:56:21 Attract
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:56:27 Repel is to push away, attract is to pull in
general 2018-11-05 21:56:33 Much better
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:56:48 Experiment a bit, I'm gonna guess backwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:56:57 Only takes like 5 seconds to test
general 2018-11-05 21:57:14 Okay let's not harass back to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:57:43 Magnets are relatively easy once you understand the basics of them
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:57:52 Which isn't much of a learning curve
general 2018-11-05 21:58:26 Ashp, you were getting involved for a second in a similar degree as Cube
general 2018-11-05 21:58:42 Dragon, experiment, and go to <#478584971670454284> for this stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:59:00 Hello_DerptasticDude
general 2018-11-05 21:59:15 Because I'm a bit busy trying to deal with the fallout of an argument
general 2018-11-05 22:00:03 This is how you were getting to Cube's level exactly ...
general 2018-11-05 22:00:19 DRAGON! For fuuuck's sake, if you're so lazy, fine, I'll find it out for you
general 2018-11-05 22:01:23 Backward is repel, forward is attract
general 2018-11-05 22:02:25 Well now you know, so please don't ask again Dragon
general 2018-11-05 22:03:10 What do you mean?
general 2018-11-05 22:03:46 Eh, that's a bit of a touchy subject, but if nobody minds I suppose we can discuss it here
general 2018-11-05 22:04:13 Just keep this in mind: Opinions are opinions, nobody's opinions are 100% the same, so just accept other people's opinions, they have their reasons
general 2018-11-05 22:04:45 I'm just iterating over just incase people get offended by stuff!
general 2018-11-05 22:05:18 I know, you haven't heard of the one guy who sent 15 bombs to Democratic places?
general 2018-11-05 22:05:57 Yeah, he's an extreme, yes, but think of what might happen if someone gets pissed off about political opinions
general 2018-11-05 22:06:03 Giant server fight
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:06:29 Er, welp, I guess that's the end of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:06:43 He tried one last time to harass me in DMs by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:07:05 Already done, I took a picture to incase anyone wants to see
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:07:32 Hello_The_Devel
general 2018-11-05 22:07:49 This was Cube's last attempt at harassing me via DM
general 2018-11-05 22:08:06 Also, after hearing about all the crap republicans have done, I'm going Democratic
general 2018-11-05 22:08:30 Xpert, I'm gonna monitor it, don't worry
general 2018-11-05 22:08:42 If a fight breaks out I'll calm the people down
general 2018-11-05 22:09:07 I saw
general 2018-11-05 22:09:17 Well, alright, sorry Dragon
general 2018-11-05 22:09:35 Er, they slightly are Dragon, remember what I explained?
general 2018-11-05 22:09:55 Just, drop it please, we want to avoid fights as much as possible
general 2018-11-05 22:10:24 Just please drop it Dragon
general 2018-11-05 22:11:15 Because we don't want someone making bomb threats because of their political view! That happened in another server I was on by the way
general 2018-11-05 22:11:30 Rent's fine, just try not to politicize it
general 2018-11-05 22:11:33 Uhhhh
general 2018-11-05 22:11:43 Not Safe For Work
general 2018-11-05 22:13:01 Nope
general 2018-11-05 22:13:30 Uuugh, forgive me and clean it up if I'm too blunt about this Xpert, but NSFW means exposed gender bits or gender bits being used
general 2018-11-05 22:14:17 That could be considered NSFW Dragon
general 2018-11-05 22:14:38 Also, "whooaaah Xpert, warning 1, rule 2" (Sarcasm/joking by the way)
the-dump 2018-11-05 22:15:16 Erhm that's, a bit too close EndRage
general 2018-11-05 22:19:42 https://thewondergallery.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/not-giant-enough-letter-f.jpg
general 2018-11-05 22:19:46 I win
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:21:47 Ashp, even if someone's showing the game around, that doesn't forgive them completely vomiting toxicity on people
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:22:26 We hear ya Obsid
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:29:04 Not inventor, but you would get replicator
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:30:55 Ehhhhh, show it I suppose?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:31:14 What am I supposed to do about it Grab?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:31:32 I'm a Discord mod, not an in-game mod
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:31:39 Sadly not Gustav, use weaker engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:32:37 Fanta, probably not with always on/off engines
Dragon, prove yourself in many ways
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:34:09 Ahehehhmmmm, maybe work on that a tiny bit Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-05 22:50:37 Post the save slot Paulo?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:54:39 Picture of the save slot and who he is in the Discord?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:55:51 Well, it'd be very difficult to keep track of, and it's just for bragging on the Discord channel, so nah, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:56:32 Fuse it with someone else's
help 2018-11-05 23:08:04 2 looks far more interesting to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:32:57 So, quick question, has anyone else seen a rope powered drawbridge before?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:33:13 You're surprised at that Fanta?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:33:22 This is a game about creativity
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:33:36 If you're surprised by that, you're gonna have to have someone carry your jaw for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:33:47 Because it'll keep on dropping to the floor with amazement
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:34:34 The Plane Crazy equivalent of a Boeing with a runway strapped to it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:34:55 Anyone? If not do you think the rope's inventor-worthy?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:36:46 Dragon, it's actually pretty frequently used for balloons
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:37:41 I'm gonna count it for now, but if any mod/admin would like to beg to differ, well, they have the power to do so, and if anyone can show rope being used at an angle far different from what it's supposed to be used for, show me
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:18 Dragon, look at how he's using the rope!
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:27 The reason I didn't count your thing was because I saw it before
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:38:44 True, but that was his creation as well
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:39:35 Eh, you're getting better Dragon, still need a few things to work out, but you're getting better
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:42:53 .____.
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:42:57 Are you absolutely shitting me?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:44:28 Fuck it, someone give ignacioel the "ultimate builder" rank or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:45:25 He probably will
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:45:31 Er, Rick probably will
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:45:39 Just not yet, he's probably ironing out the major features currently
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:55:39 Maybe the rescue ship actually
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:57:44 Uh, more like "inve-what the crap is that!?" rank
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:58:36 Dragon, have you seen what he makes?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:30 Dragon, challenge him
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:56 I literally challenged him to make this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 00:59:57 https://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1624/intrusion2-2013-06-12-19-04-56-5310240649.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:00:10 As you can see, while not 100% accurate, he did make it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:42 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/enigmata/images/8/81/Illinear.png/revision/latest?cb=20130409122928
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:42 This is what I based my own superfighter off of, but take inspiration from this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:05:57 If anyone recognizes it, +10 points
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:06:21 More specific
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:06:47 That little fighter is by far one of my most favorite ones in all of gaming, now watch as ignacioel makes a V2 that's even more amazing
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:07 Wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:12 It's the original Enigmata
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:08:34 Stellar War's the 3rd of the series, more of a base tower defense mix
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:10:03 I'm not a game mod, and quite frankly that's not dangerous
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:10:34 My superfighter's no longer going to be super is it?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:13:01 This is my superfighter, prized possession, top creation of mine, and starting to get more and more obsolete at this point
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:15:43 What have I created?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:18:03 Show a picture of both the creation and it's save slot in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:19 Picture of the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:35 Wait why not?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:19:48 Like, pictures are the most secure way of getting block counts
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:20:28 I mean, think of it as just the ship without it's spray paint
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:20:33 trollgeni, use custom colors
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:24:14 Another attempt at inventor?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:16 Er, that's not quite inventor-worthy truth be told, there's literally 5 block creations, including the seat
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:21 A unique mechanic dude
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:37 You were almost there with the gear mechanism, but sadly you were pretty much second on that one
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:25:42 Wait
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:26:32 God freaking damn, it's close, hmmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:27:11 <@456226577798135808> , I need other opinions on this, what do you think? Does this deserve inventor?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:27:53 It is, but, ehhhh, hmmmmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:08 I'm on the fence for this one, I want others' opinions
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:21 Remember that inventor's the peak of the peak of ranks pretty much
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:28:53 I have yet to see it work without major, MAJOR glitches, and even then only Imperial's gotten it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:05 Sadly you haven't because your creation was likely uncontrollable
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:14 That's what gets everyone, it needs to go that stupidly high speed and be controllable
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:22 But could it turn reasonably?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:37 Like, can you fly it away from the spawn, then turn it around and arrive back at the spawn?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:29:39 Supersonic
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:29:58 Investigating
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:31:31 I investigated the messages from you and orange brick, I saw one on orange's, but not on yours, which design was copied?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:32:02 Ehhhh, again Dragon, I'm on the fence about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:32:33 Well, you did advertise it as a tutorial Brick
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:33:01 You got Master, it overrides all the others
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:33:14 Yeup, GG, don't worry
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:33:34 Yeah, that's the rank, master builder, there's other master ranks in other categories
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:08 Dragon, if you think you deserve it, you can probably wait until other mods come on, the whole reason inventor got split in half earlier was because we were too generous
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:18 It's DragonMage's modular plane builder
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:33 That shit, at least partially works! Somehow, it works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:34:50 Ehhhhh, sadly no
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:35:40 F-16, AC-130, M1A1 Abrams, Schwable, those all count
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:36:51 RAH-66 Comanche, Qaher F-313, those count to, since those were technically built in real life, but they were never massed
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:36:56 Wait what do you mean Fanta?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:37:39 Dude, what do you want me to do Fanta? I had to zoom it out like insanity to fit the whole thing in frame
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:37:51 That, doesn't count sadly trollgeinu
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:38:00 It's gotta really closely resemble it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:38:22 FantaMaluca321's who I'm referring to
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:06 Pffff, welp
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:25 Mind if I clean the creations up a bit and show you something that'll actually impress people?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:41:34 You've got a block count ya know
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:20 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/US_Navy_051105-F-5480T-005_An_F-14D_Tomcat_conducts_a_mission_over_the_Persian_Gulf-region.jpg/1200px-US_Navy_051105-F-5480T-005_An_F-14D_Tomcat_conducts_a_mission_over_the_Persian_Gulf-region.jpg
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:20 Try making this
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:42:39 It's a swing-wing design
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:43:52 Vertical Takeoff and Landing, I heard it was Vertical Takeoff Or Landing though, whatever one works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:44:35 A video of it taking off and landing entirely vertically please?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:46:15 Also try using one of the streamable things
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:47:00 It needs to take off and land vertically, and I mean from it's normal flight position
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:47:12 Think of how a heli works, except it's also able to shift it's velocity to primarily forwards as well
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:50:54 For <#491710474786832394> , the MK2, the MK1 doesn't have the front wings and it's rear wings are smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:51:37 That's a bit fast for a vertical landing, the takeoff's fine though
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:52:05 Ehhhhh, work on the landing and I'll count it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:16 Try to use streamable or something to make it easier
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:40 Every time you put it in that kind of format I have to virus scan it just incase, because I already caught one asshole that tried to send a virus disguised as a Roblox video to my computer
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:56:56 I'd rather not have that happen to me, so I scan all of those
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:57:50 Ehhh, fine I'll count it, next time add reverse thrusters though
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:59:07 Ask the other mods Dragon, but don't spam them please, I'm on the fence, but if they say yes, well, there you go
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:59:33 There you go you got it epiclolz
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:01:47 Er, it's Dragon's that's for the inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:01:53 It's a modular plane building system
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:11 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/509176494195736577/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202529999.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:11 This thing
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:25 I already scrutinized him over that, he made one that works
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:02:40 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/509176187223015434/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202328448.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:03:53 It's nice tank
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:02 I mean, there's also this Orange
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/509176213168979998/RobloxScreenShot20181105_202343809.png
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:25 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:04:47 Well, true, you know what, just get the video tomorrow Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:06:02 That was me that did it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:06:32 It actually worked at angles I would not have expected it to work on at all
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:09:36 Meh, not the best but, I suppose so
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:13:49 Dragon, just record it please
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:20:00 Include the takeoff I suppose
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:21:11 Dragon, do you want it or not, also ignacioel, how!?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 02:23:54 Alright, well, g'night ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:48:13 Oh boy
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:52:08 Er, sure, hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:55:14 Er, hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:55:27 Ah, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-06 04:15:09 What happened?
creations-chat 2018-11-06 04:21:38 Well then, huuuuhhhh, that's very impressive
general 2018-11-06 05:16:56 Andrew, can you replace the propeller?
general 2018-11-06 05:17:10 I doubt it was on purpose, look at the technique he's trying
general 2018-11-06 05:17:18 Still though, Andrew, could you replace it?
general 2018-11-06 05:26:38 You didn't have to rip off the entire propeller, just the rockets
general 2018-11-06 05:27:30 Nah, it does offend people though, hence why we're trying to be careful
general 2018-11-06 05:36:33 So basically it's a manually guided missile rather than a fire and forget, image recognition or thermal missile?
general 2018-11-06 05:37:34 Well, when you fire it, you've gotta dedicate a key to hold it down until it impacts, so maybe manual dumbfire
general 2018-11-06 05:40:08 Just guess it Andrew, we don't have official weights yet
general 2018-11-06 05:40:21 And considering how floaty things are when they have excessive wing pannels, I'm willing to bet they're pretty light
creations-chat 2018-11-06 05:56:56 VTOL cappable I'm guessing?
general 2018-11-06 06:02:12 Get 6860 speed while still remaining controllable
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:02:32 I have a feeling it's not too durable, mainly considering the low block count
general 2018-11-06 06:02:46 While still being able to turn at a controllable rate?
general 2018-11-06 06:03:16 Won't work, wings make drag, alot of it
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:03:40 I'll show you my MK2 combat fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:03:57 Since the rocket update it's been revamped, so all the jets were replaced with super rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:04:12 It turns on a dime, it's as tough as a brick and it's pretty fast to
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:04:29 It even has reverse thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:06:09 Oh yeah, since it was before the arena update, the cockpit's a solid model, so it's slightly hard to aim, but at the same time it's a solid model
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:08:33 He must've engineered it well then, because as he lost parts, it all balanced out, so while it may've slightly affected his performance, it wouldn't have crippled him
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:10:34 The hell? Huh, never had that happen
creations-chat 2018-11-06 06:21:35 Yes I do, but can you remind me tomorrow? I'm getting really tired now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:01 What's the issue? Dragon's horrible at explaining
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:11 Also, nice My Hero Academia icon
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:50:42 Dragon, you are infact horrible at explaining, do we need to point out what the hell happened in <#491710474786832394> again? Or can we lay that to rest?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:52:43 For the love of god ... If you still think I'm bullying you, just, I don't even know what to say anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:58:22 DRAGON, for fuck's sake, you say to stop and here you are, TLDR he suggested replacing the current magnet system, which he found "confusing" "glitchy" and "laggy", the last one being fixed next update, which is soon, with a positive and negative magnet system
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:58:53 The entire server disagreed, and he's still harping on about it to this date ...
creations-chat 2018-11-07 03:59:50 Dragon, you saw what happened to Cube, do you want the same thing to happen to you?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:00:10 What I'm saying is, can you please drop it, and play nice
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:00:26 TLDR Cube harassed the entire server after I flushed him out of harassing the testing server
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:01:40 ... I'm gonna start logging this down, I'd suggest you stop, like now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:12 Whatever it is it's obnoxious
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:40 Dragon, I am still sick, I lost two fucking pounds over a week
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:02:54 Now can you please just stop, my funny bone is as good as dead for now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:03:16 DRAGON, can you please
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:03:41 ...... You aren't taking this seriously are you?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:04:05 Fuck it, I'm out
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:05:16 Shoot, use downwards engines
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:05:30 I'd suggest using rocket engines, as those can only go one direction and can't be counted as assistance
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:06:06 Dragon made a modular plane building system, that's how
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:07:05 I am fucking sick Dragon, NOW CAN YOU NOT!? Until I get better I'm taking everything seriously ...
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:07:58 For the love of fuck, just end it now
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:08:38 He's got nitro, he has custom emotes
creations-chat 2018-11-07 04:08:49 You can tell he has nitro because his icon's a gif, rather than a static picture
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:13:42 Just don't Orange, leave him be
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:14:16 Dragon, I repeatedly said I was sick, I take everything seriously, and you repeatedly tried to make a joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:14:33 I didn't think it was funny, yet for the sake of it, I'm letting it pass, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:15:19 Wait till you're bedridden and loose several pounds in single weeks, then you'll realize how unfunny it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:15:27 For now just stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:16:02 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:16:15 Fuck it, everyone just end it now
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:17:54 Gently move it to <#497142796961054721> please?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:38:12 I'm just going to
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:38:34 Dragon, whatever the hell you're on, please, get off of it, I've had enough
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:43:29 Dragon, seriously, just stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:44:02 Jackal, it has so many upvotes because so many people like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:46:39 Congrats Jackal, you're master at both now
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:50:54 Already done, blame ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:51:06 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:51:25 Nevermind, still saw a glider earlier
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:51:31 You can't get inventor twice
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:51:33 So don't even try
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:52:42 For fuck's sake, that's aircraft from aircraft and gliders, already done
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:52:55 Now quit trying to inventor-snipe, you're gonna look like an asshole on the same level of name sniping
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:53:41 Sneaky, how is that a question? Also someone made the German flettner plane before
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:54:20 I'll find it for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:54:31 Also, sneaky, just stop, I'm not in the mood for joking
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:55:04 https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/HloAAOSwHoFXsrfu/s-l300.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:55:04 Someone already made this boymahina
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:55:19 AND NO SNEAKY, NOW FUCK OFF PLEASE, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR JOKING AND I WILL EMPHASIZE IT
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:55:46 It's called BEING SICK DRAGON, now please, get over it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:55:50 ......
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:56:06 Dragon, I saw that in the god damn logs
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:56:14 Infact, the other mods can see it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:56:18 So next time don't just delete it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:56:52 Ag
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:57:14 Nobody's made one, so go for it boymahi
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:57:37 He's gotta make one that ac-
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:57:57 Sneakygrizzly, take a hint, I am not in the mood for jokes, now please, you do not get inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:58:28 Sam that is very much bannable you know ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:58:46 Warning 1, rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:59:32 ... For fuck's sake, for fuck's, fucking, sake, guys, I am not in the mood for joking, I am not in the mood for laughs or silly things, now please, stop it now before I loose it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 04:59:56 IT IS NOT INVENTOR YOU MORON, NOW FUCK OFF
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:00:06 It might be modeler, BUT THERE'S A FUCKTON OF A-10S OUT THERE
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:00:10 YES
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:00:16 OF COURSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE BLIMPS
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:00:27 A BLIMP, A SUB, A HYDROFOIL, PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:00:59 Dragon, you can just sod off, I know what the rules are, and it's being provoked, massively
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:01:19 ..... Thanks boymahi
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:01:46 He's trying to knock some sense into you before I get an excuse to whack you to the moon with a ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:02:00 Which, let's be honest, nobody likes that
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:02:13 Just what the hell is, .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:02:30 Fuck this shit fuck this shit, FUCK, THIS, SHIT
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:02:41 I'm going to ask Xpert for a resignation tomorrow, I can't deal with this while being sick
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:03:33 Dragoneye, they're ALL fucking harassing me and I'm FUCKING SICK TO HELL
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:03:55 Sorry you had to come in at this time suson, ignore everything above
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:04:15 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:04:57 Just, fuck it, I'm not dealing with this while sick, stop it now or so help me I'm smacking you with a mute, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:05:09 DragonMage, the mod you're talking to IS SICK AS HELL
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:05:14 AND NONE OF YOU SEEM TO GET IT
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:05:40 ......
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:10:05 Riiight, I'm back, now then
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:10:56 Next smartass thing I hear I'm going to throw a mute down for repeated rule 1 and 6 violation, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:11:11 And Sam, don't think I didn't see what you were posting, rule 2, again, although I'm going to be nice and not give a warning, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:11:30 "Harassment of other members will not be tolerated.", and guess who's trying to force me out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:12:19 Sam, <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> please
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:12:41 Thank ye kindly Sam
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:13:40 C4RAB, not exactly helping now
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:14:26 Post it in <#504436696021204992> Ghost and I can rank you based on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:14:40 And jet spam is when you place down as many jets as possible to try to lag out the server
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:15:41 Ghost, be careful with that
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:15:52 That's pretty easily bannable, mostly due to the excessive lag that the sheer amount of rockets causes
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:16:28 You can cuss Sam, infact you can do it somewhat fine, just don't narrow it down towards someone unprovoked
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:17:14 It's not just the particles that does it sneaky, if it was that easy then nobody would complain about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:18:17 I'll say how, you repeatedly asked questions that are literally answered infront of your face, in order to get a reaction from me, infact, you're pretty much trying to bother me until I leave the server, same with DragonMage so he can "call dibs"
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:18:45 If I had to guess I'd say it's Roblox physics trying to update at a high enough rate
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:19:14 Sneaky, I said no, you didn't listen
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:20:00 Seeker, if you're the one that spammed the chat I am fully prepared to clean up after you and make sure you can't chat anymore, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:20:12 Also, boymahi, it's actually grabbing chat from the top, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:21:46 .... Well, that was a nice interlude from the back and forth arguing
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:22:18 I mentioned I was sick and would take things very seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:22:31 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:22:34 Excuse me while I get it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:23:54 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:24:02 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:24:06 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:24:37 I literally am showing you pictures of when I mentioned it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:25:01 ...
help 2018-11-07 05:27:32 Your center of lift is too far back, center of mass too far forwards, so you need to dedicate too much to just pulling up
help 2018-11-07 05:27:47 You can also rotate and use jets in different directions
help 2018-11-07 05:27:55 So try adding a pair of up and down jets on the wingtips
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:31:43 ... Empire, you think a ping is that bad?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:31:55 You try people actively gunning for your throat, THEN tell me being pinged is bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:32:23 Halfway what I meant
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:33:47 This is a chat for creations, if you submit a picture of a creation, various videos or whatnot, it'll get dragged via bot over to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:34:08 So <#384025409945337856> is moreso the gallery of what people have made, <#504436696021204992> is moreso talking about what people have made
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:34:34 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:34:53 Then earn it Dragon, so far every time you seem to be getting better you hammer it down
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:35:08 As brutal as that sounds, you EARN being a moderator, and just as easily you can loose it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:36:06 I could sift through the chat, I'm not going to
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:36:21 He's been here for a while actually C4RAB
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:37:25 I'm not sure that those were made before boymahina
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:37:52 Then pretend you're a mod now Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:38:15 Then tell them you got permission from me
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:39:05 Because if he wants to be a mod so badly, well let's see what he can do
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:39:28 I've met people that act like shit outside of the job, then when they're in the job they're more professional than people that have worked there for years
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:39:38 So why not? Let's give him a shot
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:39:45 If he wants to be a mod, show us what you've got
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:40:21 Eh, alright, start it at about 2:00 PM
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:41:21 Be 100% sure they're breaking the rules Dragon, false bans create hatred to mods and admins
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:41:43 Empire, you get the point
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:42:08 He didn't get banned, he ragequit from the server after I found him out for harassing people, first in the test server, then in the actual Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:43:26 You can't really deny a picture of you in a vehicle that matches the culprit's vehicle to the dent to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:44:37 Not the point, missiles were enabled outside of arena mode in the test server for ease of testing their effects
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:44:52 What he did was spawncamp people that tried to legitimately test and/or build vehicles with the new missile system
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:44:59 It's a long story that's passed already Empire
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:45:12 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:46:54 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:47:04 The hangar part is already made, but the actual craft?
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:47:35 Ehhhhh, it's actually unique enough in my book, gonna leave it up to others' decisions though
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:48:32 Heh, Dragon, that's a bit excessive, modeler only requires a unique looking craft
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:48:46 Although you're getting there, sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:00 Not inventor, modeler
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:49:09 Motors
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:20 Look above
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:49:35 "I was thinking modeler but k"
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:50:22 You don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:50:37 Motors can spin in any 360 degree direction on their angle
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:50:41 Provided that it's not obstructed
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:51:30 It's okay suson, stuff happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:51:47 Not a problem, any more issues, ask away
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:51:50 G'night Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:51:58 I'm guessing that's why suson asked Empire
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:52:33 Hey, that's not a bad thing necessarily Empire
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 05:53:29 Alright then, good to note
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:53:42 I'll crank it through a GIF converter for you
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:54:16 WHOPS
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:54:29 That broke!
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:54:50 https://streamable.com/zthdg
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:54:57 There we go, I think
creations-chat 2018-11-07 05:55:09 Not a problem, try using Streamable
help 2018-11-07 05:59:00 Not me, but I think when the others are on they can send techniques, if you aren't on when they're on, ask them to DM me, and I can then message you when you're on
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 06:11:53 More like an undersea rover, I like it
general 2018-11-08 01:23:02 Why exactly?
general 2018-11-08 01:23:29 Let me guess, C4RAB?
general 2018-11-08 01:24:00 Then you'll know it's a test for you, to see if you're worthy
general 2018-11-08 01:24:23 If so, we can probably take turns cycling out, namely when I'm busy during weekdays
general 2018-11-08 01:24:35 If not, oh well, you're still in the same spot
general 2018-11-08 01:24:51 Just DM me who they are and a part of their message, I can CTRL+F the section
general 2018-11-08 01:25:14 Example: If you DMed me "And no mod is on", I can jump over to the section via CTRL+F and assign the ranks later
general 2018-11-08 01:25:26 Think of it like a book's index or something
general 2018-11-08 01:25:37 Then when I come on the DM messages will stay
general 2018-11-08 01:25:50 And since they stay around, I can quickly scan through the chat via those messages
general 2018-11-08 01:26:09 Just make sure they're close to the chat, and not too generic, something like "Yea but ur not always on" is good, but something like "ok" is pretty bad
general 2018-11-08 01:26:10 Nope
general 2018-11-08 01:26:14 Try it
general 2018-11-08 01:26:39 Pick a random sequence somewhere and DM me the message, I'll tell you the chat above and below it
general 2018-11-08 01:28:08 Example: "i made a big ploen with 445 parts and it flies well"
general 2018-11-08 01:28:40 If you gave me that, I would've responded with "or just make it easy on yourself and use two rotors counter-rotating" above, and "Lol xD" below
general 2018-11-08 01:28:57 Ctrl+F the example in <#504436696021204992> and you'll see what I mean
general 2018-11-08 01:30:45 Go on, try it with something in <#384021699466756107> , pick a random piece of chat far in the history that I can search for, copy and paste the whole sequence, and I'll give you the example above and below it
general 2018-11-08 01:33:00 Above: "In Plane Crazy, you don't NEED one, but they're very nice to have"
Below: "left right"
general 2018-11-08 01:33:27 See? DM me the sequence and I can zip over to it
general 2018-11-08 01:33:54 Now ya don't have to feel bad about leaving people out, because you can basically assign a key to them that I can review later
general 2018-11-08 01:34:56 Ehhhh, no thanks
general 2018-11-08 01:35:09 I can see the bot ya know
general 2018-11-08 01:35:23 Nah, my ears are a bit sensitive
general 2018-11-08 01:35:43 I am literally at 1 and stuff's still loud
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:38:59 Part count?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:40:26 Show a picture?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 01:45:03 Try building bigger or more unique things
help 2018-11-08 01:57:48 Magnet engines in theory, but those are very elegant designs, like, ludicrously so
help 2018-11-08 02:09:10 Soooo, Dragon, try toning it back a bit, you're being a bit, I guess blunt and open about it
help 2018-11-08 02:12:43 Yeaahhh, just try to be nice and helpful to people, like, instead of calling me over, just DM me who needs what rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 02:49:14 The further out the control surfaces are from the respective axis, the more effective they are
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:30:31 ... Let's see then, give us the engine count as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:30:38 And be sure to comb over every single tab
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:31:35 Comb over every single tab and show us the engine count if it truly has zero engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:32:10 Or are you hiding the fact that it has some hidden engines of some sort inside some of the framework? If not, you have nothing to worry about
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:32:15 ... Pictures totten, pictures
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:33:10 Then you have engines inside of your vehicle and that's the end of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:33:55 Quit bullshitting totten, unless you're willing to provide hard evidence, it's to be considered a lie
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:34:15 Send it here then, so everyone can see
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:34:33 Then it's a lie totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:35:33 False alarm, it was just some fool going over his head, he made a warp drive variant
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:37:44 He's begging me not to, should I?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:38:08 There we go, was that so bad?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:38:13 It's a warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:38:29 He thinks he "found" a warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:39:36 Do I need to say more? You lying piece of crap?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:40:06 You're simply bluffing and making up lies to get to your position
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:40:45 I can pull up you begging for inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:40:57 Should I do that to guys?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:42:07 Apparently people dislike me being fully honest and actually a good and solid mod
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:42:44 I'm not kind to people bullshitting their way around
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:43:58 Ehhhhh, fine then, I'll TRY to ease up, but at the same time totten, don't try to lie your way around
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:44:14 And if you try to deny lying, I have this to show people
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:45:38 How about search up "warp drive", which appeared in the chat alot, or look at the ranks?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:47:05 It's already got a name totten, the Warp Drive
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:49:32 This is the first one I can find
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:50:00 A bomb can be literally anything that's dropped from your plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:51:47 It's suspension and magnets arranged in such a way that the magnets add force to the aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:52:40 This was made back during the first major update, so I'm guessing yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:53:56 I found it in the chat, so why can't you take the effort to find it? Unless you're only interested in copying it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:54:06 5 bombs on a target
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:54:07 That's it
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:54:28 In the server, it's still floating around in there
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:54:51 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:55:08 I'm not actually experienced in warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:55:12 Just experiment Fanta
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:55:55 Still counts
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:57:13 Then maybe have people teach you it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 03:57:51 5 bombs of any sort dropped onto someone ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:59:06 Long story short we've got a glitch in Plane Crazy called the warp drive, which involves a series of carefully constructed magnets and suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:59:15 They want me to show them a picture so they can copy off of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:59:48 Think of a real life electromagnet, except everything's magnetic
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 03:59:54 Well, everything on your plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:00:10 Looks nice Collin, extend the props a bit though
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:00:34 If I was a soldier I would NOT trust those tiny things to carry me and whatever else is on-board to battle
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:01:04 Totten, have someone else teach you it, experiment yourself or try looking through the chat again, end of story
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:03:59 I'd say video, but if you can drop a sufficient amount of payload, screenshot would be fine
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:04:17 Basically, either accuracy or just plain flattening the area via mass bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:09:38 Good for you, now you've got alot to make before becoming a true inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:10:10 The hell? Uhhhh, alriiiight then?
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:12:37 For the love of, use Streamable please or something that converts to gifs!
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:13:11 You hit him, try to actually nail the bombs ON him next time
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:13:15 But don't crash
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:17:24 Niiice, post a blockcount?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:21:28 Test server
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 04:22:26 RIP, I would've intervened before, but Meal seems, at least semi-fine with it
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:23:08 I'll let the others decide on inventor or not, a bit tired and burned out now
creations-chat 2018-11-08 04:25:56 I'll let the rank speak for it's self
general 2018-11-08 04:50:15 It's in the test server
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:11:59 How the actual fuck did I guess he would? How so?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 05:31:37 RIP
help 2018-11-08 05:54:39 That's why I've been asking for block counts
help 2018-11-08 05:55:01 Specifically to show how many leftover helium blocks there are
help 2018-11-08 05:57:19 That's literally what the build list is or and why I ask for the block count
help 2018-11-08 06:00:00 Ahem
help 2018-11-08 06:00:53 C4RAB, it literally solves the problem right there and then, and I do ask them to place down blocks to update the value, so they can't just hope for a glitch
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:40 Block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:49 Dragon, it can definitely fly ...
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:21:58 I can already tell from the wings' positioning, alongside the engines
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:22:20 After witnessing alot of creations you can actually learn which ones fly and which ones don't purely via eyeballing it, and you can get good part estimates to
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:22:58 Look at the engines on the underbelly
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:23:29 Those are angled at a slightly odd angle, meaning they're all on some form of motor
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:24:12 I already did it, sorta did a rough block count via looking it over as well
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:33:45 Alright, cool, what for exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:39:34 Any rank requests or just wanna show off?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:50:13 ._. Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:50:49 I'm just gonna pre-emptively give you lag machine, considering the size of that thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:51:31 I heard of bigger is better, and that thing takes the cake, clones it, and runs with both cakes
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:52:18 There, you're now overseer, call me when it's 4K and I'll give it to ya
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:52:27 I think a single digit error margin will be fine as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:52:34 Also, anyone debate modeler for him?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:52:45 I've seen turrets, I've seen big turrets, then I see THAT THING
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:55:47 "Build a creation that has a unique design. Creation must be 500+ blocks to qualify."
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:56:05 Nothing about movement, so Xpert, mind if I give him modeler for that, thing? It's not even a turret, it's a siege engine
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:56:21 Show the thing Lansink?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:56:45 I'll repost it, it's flyingflygon44's
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:56:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/510254658258731056/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:57:06 Er, wait, hold on
creations-chat 2018-11-09 00:57:14 I think so
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:57:23 DOING LIKE 5 THINGS AT ONCE HERE, FORGIVE A MARGIN OF ERROR!
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:58:26 Sorry <@!260534086400081920> , had to downgrade it since it's a land based creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:00:17 Er, sorry Phoenix, ice blocks are supposed to be low friction blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:00:42 Eeerrrrrhhhhmmmmmm, ah, he actually got you there Xpert
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:01:11 When you hit the limit, stuff won't save anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:01:35 Can't aweso, it's a Roblox thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:01:52 Even if we tried to circumvent it, it'd probably break more stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:01:59 Only way we can is to make our builds more efficient
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:05:25 No idea, also send a picture of it to someone you trust flying, that way you can copy it if it ever does get deleted
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:10:47 Not enough lift SirNo, the game models aerodynamics with wing pannels, and even then only very loosely
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:12:15 You need to use actual wing pannels, not custom built wings, or cram hidden wing pannels inside of the aircraft
creations-chat 2018-11-09 01:30:07 Looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:42:57 I somewhat doubt it
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:50:26 ... Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:51:11 Next time, don't spam and maybe Dyno won't bother you
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:51:49 ... Fucking hell, TOTTEN!
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:52:36 Then be mad over something in your own little corner maybe? Instead of trying to press it onto everyone else?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:52:58 At the very least don't do it in a destructive manner ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:53:25 How the hell am I being harsh for you spamming up literally my entire window on my widescreen monitor with your single letter SPAM exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:55:13 It gets worse when they target it at you, trust me ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:55:55 Some could argue that my harshness is what makes me good
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:57:21 Again, I'm harsh to idiots (idiots being trolls or anyone that tries to make others unhappy in some way), so if you don't bother anyone, you have nothing to worry about, and I'll seem like a nice guy
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:58:18 Well, I would've thrown it in <#495286269459300364> or <#497142796961054721> , but it fits here
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:58:35 Something tells me totten's blocked me as well because he doesn't want to listen to anyone except himself
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:58:57 Maybe not, don't know
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 01:59:50 That's not even the worst of it, the worst of it is that they will pick up anything just to start a fight
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:09:39 Alright, move this somewhere else? I think it's getting off topic
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:10:16 Tanks aren't that impressive
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:10:37 Also, I can count that as theft of coolawesomespy12's creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:43:54 Can you even save that many blocks Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:44:46 What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:46:50 Gonna be on a Terraria break for a while
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:46:54 Just post it in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:47:56 Oy, half my friends still play it on and off
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:48:09 Be back 10:30-11:00 ish
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:49:57 Can you guys please clean up this conversation? I don't want to have to start slapping people with stop signs
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:50:23 Thank ye kindly Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:51:07 I'm slapping you with a stop sign warning sneaky, rule 2, no 18+ NSFW content
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:51:16 Spooky, give it something unique and we'll be impressed
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:51:33 It's a trucking simulator, we sorta have a few of those already
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:52:08 I'm guessing text files?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:53:16 Ehhhh, again, Terraria break, only had to come back here because sneaky doesn't know what's inappropriate and what isn't
creations-chat 2018-11-09 03:09:16 Radars aren't picking up anything, is it a fluke? On a more serious note, nice job with the bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 04:01:13 You're probably slamming stuff onto the tail of the plane, check your center of lift vs center of mass (blue vs yellow/orange)
creations-chat 2018-11-09 05:37:50 Bio, try using motors to rotate the engines
help 2018-11-09 08:19:10 It's actually going to possibly be updated soon, but basically it's Roblox color palette limitations, it defaults to a certain few core colors
help 2018-11-09 08:19:27 Saves a bit of data, kinda murders colors
help 2018-11-09 08:19:49 And if you haven't noticed by the giant "OMG" turret we saw earlier, people are starting to get crunched in terms of data
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:00:00 Add an extra motor that adds more rotation and less rotation
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:38:58 Try packaging together a ton of suspension, but make one of them stiff?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:39:38 Like, a cube, made entirely with suspension at different directions tied together, but one of the suspensions are replaced by blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:39:42 All max stiffness
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:39:50 Er, max stiffness and length
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 20:42:02 You can use a motor to simulate a hinge
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:43:44 Just capture a picture of it's speed going dumb levels of fast
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:44:44 There
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:47:22 I don't think light speed's exactly difficult anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:47:57 Not even that, just get a glitch that flings you
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:48:29 Nada, sorry, not horizontal, and it's not enough to get the other ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:48:44 Are you shitting me? E+16!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:48:53 That's 16 digits if I'm not mistaken
creations-chat 2018-11-09 22:49:00 SirNoHate
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:49:32 Er, look at the decimal point
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:49:51 Ehhhh, I don't think so
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:50:02 1 E+2 = 100
help 2018-11-09 22:50:42 You bother Rick about that, and even then he's very, very busy, just post it under <#498473314445033472> for him to view later, without pinging him
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:52:46 Colors didn't save?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 22:53:06 No idea
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:01:23 Show a block count Dust?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:02:28 Via picture, not via message
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:02:55 God freaking, it's hard to see how many blocks it is so I can't give a rough estimate
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:16 Either that or I'm really tired in many ways
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:18 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:22 Take a picture of the save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-09 23:03:53 Done
bug-reports 2018-11-09 23:12:13 I'm staying out until this is fixed, that's why you don't see me in the servers
bug-reports 2018-11-09 23:12:35 I want to be sure saves do NOT get corrupted
bug-reports 2018-11-09 23:22:13 I have a feeling it's everyone trying to hit lightspeed that's doing it
creations-chat 2018-11-10 00:40:14 Dust, post block count pictures rather than saying what they are
creations-chat 2018-11-10 00:54:47 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-10 00:54:55 Er, done for all I mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 00:58:08 Guys ...
creations-chat 2018-11-10 01:01:54 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 01:05:39 Folding craft Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 01:05:50 Make the bridge fold or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:10:43 Mahi, Kiwi, Deception, pay attention to where you're at ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:11:23 You guys basically dropped a vomit bomb, and I'm the janitor ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:11:49 No bans, it was just a joke taken too far Empire
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:15:59 AAHHHEEEMMMMM, Empire, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:16:23 Cake, let it happen, that's what <#495286269459300364> is exactly for
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:17:21 ... I'm not going to clean up Empire's thing because it'd be basically violating free speech, you may have your opinions however you wish, but I will clean up any further spam
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:18:12 ... You may say what you want, and it can and will be used against you if applicable
the-dump 2018-11-10 04:18:50 Kiwi, do it once
the-dump 2018-11-10 04:19:01 For fuck's sake, this is the dump, not the spam cesspits
the-dump 2018-11-10 04:19:43 If we made that then this wouldn't be a Roblox-applicable server anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:20:24 Off topic or the dump please you two ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:23:12 Empire, let me just ask, is that a joke, or are you serious, and if so, what the hell did I do to you exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:23:47 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:23:59 Cake, do you wanna wind up like Cube?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:14 Not banned
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:19 He was muted, then ragequit out of the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:33 Followed by joining back in in an attempt to DM me, but he realized I blocked him
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:38 So he left again
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:49 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:24:50 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:25:00 For fuck's sake __**GUYS**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:25:11 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:26:15 For fuck's sake, for __**FUUUUUCK'S SAKE!!!!!**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:27:04 I could use "To calm the server down" as an excuse
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:27:12 Because this is massively getting out of hand at an absurd rate
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:27:57 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:28:08 Empire, honestly, what IS your problem with me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:28:23 Then why am I your scapegoat for everything?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:28:58 This begs to differ
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:29:54 If it's satire then quit it, I've mentioned it a crazy amount of times that I'm not in the mood for satire of any sort
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:30:12 Deception, don't start an emote war ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:30:54 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:31:01 __**GUYS**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:31:08 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:31:11 DECEPTION
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:31:16 .....
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:31:37 Guys, for fuck's sake, all of you, please just stop, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:32:07 ... __***GUUUUYYYYYSSSSSS***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:32:16 FOR FUCK'S SAKE, BREAK IT UP BEFORE I ADD SLOWMODE ON
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:32:38 Thank you, good god
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:33:44 Geraldo, don't you dare
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:34:10 Gerardo then, whatever, I'm really tired of this
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:34:16 That's it
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:34:35 MAX SLOWMODE, DEAL WITH IT GUYS, sorry but this is too much
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:35:07 I'll disable slowmode if everyone calms down, and/or before I leave
general 2018-11-10 04:36:02 I had to freeze it because it sorta blew up in the mother of all uncontrollable nukes
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:36:42 Well it's the best I can do
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:36:55 Right, now it's off
general 2018-11-10 04:37:29 It's fixed
general 2018-11-10 04:37:39 If not let me try turning it on and off again
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:38:04 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:38:27 Oh hey, where the fuck did your commander rank go <@!417295378401198080> !? OH I KNOW, YOU PINGED IT AWAY
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:38:40 Now unless you want me to ping more ranks off of your name, cut the shit, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:38:58 I'm dearly sorry Gerardo, but I don't want a ping war
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:39:22 IMPERIAL, fine, I'm gonna say it, I DON'T HAVE THE MUTE ROLE ANYMORE
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:39:33 Hence all the roundabout bullshit
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:39:37 After Cube ragequit I can't mute
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:39:42 So I need to take action in other ways
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:39:54 Because Gerardo wanted to start a ping war
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:40:20 Riiiight, gonna give back commander
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:40:43 Match their speed fungamer
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:40:48 Gerardo, <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:41:32 If you're talking about deadmist, please, <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:41:51 THANK YOU, finally
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:42:40 It's worse, because neither side will suffer fallout from it, and they're both aware of that in the entirity
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:43:44 It's overkill, but in the best of ways
creations-chat 2018-11-10 04:45:41 You hit escape Deception, good job, you got one above it
creations-chat 2018-11-10 04:45:54 YOU ALREADY HAVE IT!
creations-chat 2018-11-10 04:46:17 Well, you don't need orbital if you have escape
creations-chat 2018-11-10 04:48:23 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:01:04 Bombardier I see
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:01:14 With a ballast payload
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:01:40 What counts as a "bomb" isn't specified, so the fact that you went with ballasts is a plus
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:05:21 You're at 9 digits, you need 1 more then to hit 6 with the first one
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:10:42 Want any ranks or just to show off?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 05:10:57 Hence why you have almost every single rank under the sun Imperial
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:05 Use motors to fold stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:23 Think of your creation like a piece of paper, then fold it like an origami, and place motors along the fold points
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:11:45 Imperial learned some stupid magic that makes his aircraft even better than that, but I doubt he's teaching
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 05:19:35 I think Roblox can't handle how awesome it is Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 05:25:21 I'd imagine weight
creations-chat 2018-11-10 05:26:44 There's a lesson, save often
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 05:33:38 We cleaned it up Collin, sorry about that
help 2018-11-10 05:34:56 Dragging this to <#498473314445033472>
bug-reports 2018-11-10 05:35:12 From curlytop4321: "So is anyone else having an issue where motors spun by jets dont spin they just lock up? Becuase now half of my creations dont work"
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 05:46:41 Looks like one hell of a party down there Res
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 06:05:18 Multiply the speed by 4 and you'll hit light speed Imperial
creations-chat 2018-11-10 06:05:36 Not all day, today's just a long day
creations-chat 2018-11-10 06:05:57 Also could you try recording it so we can see it hit 7 tril? Then you'll get lightspeed
creations-chat 2018-11-10 06:06:56 Oh
help 2018-11-10 07:06:47 Ballasts at the bottom and helium at the top
creations-chat 2018-11-10 19:45:35 9 digits Stone, you need 10, go 11 just to be safe
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:47:07 Don't put it to one side or the other, put it in the center
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:50:47 I suppose so
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:50:51 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:57:14 Hey, I only bashed a 120 slowmode because it was getting too out of hand
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:58:13 And even then I removed it shortly afterwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 19:58:43 120 SLOWMODE ENABLED (Not really)
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:03:40 Any craft that can take off and land entirely vertically
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:03:46 Er, that also goes forwards
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:03:58 Like, think harrier or F-35
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:05:00 For the love of, USE STREAMABLE PLEASE
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:09:04 Check the pins
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:13:56 Light speed overrode the other two speeds you had
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 20:34:20 Ouch, well then
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:05:47 I don't think it's a warp drive even, those use suspension, not rope
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:40:56 Uhhhhhh, did I take something bad? (Joking by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:41:35 For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, now think of how that would apply
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:24:20 Seriously totten?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:30:29 I think so
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:31:33 Totten, don't ping him
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:31:39 DUDE
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:32:11 He's on GTA5 every single time he's "offline", don't you think it doesn't actually mean he's offline?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:32:18 Also, try improving upon it Imperial, see what you can do
creations-chat 2018-11-10 22:32:58 Send a picture of the block count if you want any ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-10 22:33:03 Pfffff, I don't think that counts sadly
creations-chat 2018-11-10 22:33:24 +10 points for creativity and thoughtfulness, but I thought you meant parking your blimp on a carrier
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:33:40 Might be a hacker?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:33:58 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:35:29 We think it's a hacker/exploiter, at least, I think so
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 22:38:37 If it's a test rick, sorry about the false alarm, it's just, I sorta don't want a hacker to smash into Plane Crazy, they can do crazy stuff to any games they touch
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:11:10 If you want ranks, please show blockcount to
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:14:28 Just take a picture of your save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:14:47 Mods and admins manually assign ranks, because no bot's capable of doing it without being seriously gamed to hell
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:17:01 I think you already got the applicable ranks Royal
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:17:05 Also, done Unique
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:18:27 OH WAIT
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:18:38 Nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:18:44 Designer's achieved
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:19:25 Expert (The rank below that) is 500+ for builder, master designer you've already got, master replicator requires 500+ blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:19:52 Sorry about that snoopy, repost them?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:00 Actually, nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:01 I'll check myself
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:21 Still need the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:32 Post the save slot snoopy?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:20:55 Royal, I literally said "master designer you've already got"
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:21:20 Snoopy, post the save slot like Unique did, then I can judge it
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:21:42 Ehhhh, I'll do a rough count, but I'll low-ball it, okay?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:22:08 There, you got a low estimate on block count from me
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:23:29 Largest one, whichever one you want me to base the rank off of
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:23:48 ._.
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:24:05 Do I even need to argue that that's modeler-worthy?
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:24:30 Congrats Erick, you got modeler for that
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:24:41 Totten did
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:24:55 He went on some desperate "Let's play GTA5" rant or something, I don't know
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:25:18 That is one hell of an impressive plane, well done Erick
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:25:43 Or, impressive, whatever it is to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:27:40 Yeup, I've developed a knack for guessing planes' block counts, assuming single blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-10 23:28:02 Uhhh, engines being used for lift on the sides, sorry but no
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:46:12 It's not fun Inferno
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 23:58:10 Durability trial?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 00:24:58 Done, and no idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 00:55:55 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 00:55:59 Can we ease up on the pings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 00:56:07 Also, shouldn't it be obvious that Xpert's not there?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 00:56:09 Also hi
creations-chat 2018-11-11 01:00:21 The new rockets act like homing missiles, although their homing is a close proximity
creations-chat 2018-11-11 01:01:32 They're probably not working because they're arena weapons
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:22:12 Totten, if you fucking copy, so help me
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:41:16 Well then mx, one step above the rest huh? Nice job
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:41:52 If I'm not mistaken, it seems to dynamically change the rotors so that the ones tilted to the desired direction are more angled
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:42:13 In other words, it's tilting the rotor blades rather than the heli it's self
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:42:22 I'd say inventor-worthy, what about you potatoe?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:42:42 ... Calling a mod "noob" is a good way to get banned you know, just saying
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:43:00 Don't rub it in guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:43:04 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:43:11 I'm just gonna erase that a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:43:51 Yeup, if it's not strong enough, stack them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:44:10 mx, you might have a chance at getting inventor for that system, try recording a video of them working while in-flight
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:44:18 A propeller engine is just velocity
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:44:51 Flame, I literally said, it tilts the propeller blades so they pick up more thrust in a specific direction
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:45:12 MX, it's still inventor-worthy if you can get it in the air
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:45:20 Doesn't matter how stupid it looks, you've sorta impressed us all here
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:46:04 Ehhh, I'd suggest no helium because then you can get prop stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:46:07 Hold on a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:48:13 Welcome_RRocker325
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:50:22 Let's just see it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:50:41 Also please ping me if you have the picture and ranks or if you need mod attention for something
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:51:16 I think those look fine Sam
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:51:33 Which image Tim?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 01:52:37 Try clicking on images
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:00:25 Apparently building in Besiege makes you brilliant on Plane Crazy to
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:03:23 The learning curve for each new mechanism is extreme Imperial, to the point where each inventor is probably someone who's passed one of those curves
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:05:23 Chinook? We've seen alot of them, do it with your mechanism mx
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:05:40 Also, think the heli mechanism he made is worthwhile for inventor, or have we seen it before?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:27 It tilts the heli's rotor blades while it's moving so it goes in one direction
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:06:44 Basically, rather than tilting the entire craft, it tilts only the rotors
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:39:46 You need to go about 4X that speed Empire
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:40:18 5,995,845,800 
vs
1,671,699,712
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:40:38 Also don't worry cody, function over fashion, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:40:58 Uhhhh, I'm not even gonna check that one, I can see more digits tack- wait a second
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:41:11 What's with that slight difference over the last 4?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:41:45 Yeah cody, also, I haven't played in a while, so forgive me, but why is the top row above the 4 missing a few pixels?
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:00 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:12 It's just the menus acting weird, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:45:54 Nah, the +14 means there's 14 digits
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:46:21 Example: 5 E+2 = 500
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:58:29 God damn ._. mx, show us it being used, we're practically dying for a demo of something like that
creations-chat 2018-11-11 03:59:02 Dude, mxdanger, look at <#384025409945337856> , people are being awestruck by that
bug-reports 2018-11-11 04:01:43 1: It's accurate enough as it is, there's a pretty generous lock-on, and
2: Bigger problem: Rockets can apparently damage others' crafts in build mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:05:26 Rocket, do you mind dragging that to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> please?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:05:29 And use any block
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:05:43 Like, just drop blocks on people
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:05:49 That's been the tradition of bombardier
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:12:51 You already have it Res, but yeah, like that
creations-chat 2018-11-11 04:13:25 Alright fine, I guess amazing stuff needs time to cook huh?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:17:11 Hawk, it's any vehicle that can go up and down, but in this case we're counting it as "Any vehicle that can take off and land completely vertically while having primarily forward momentum"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:58:54 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:58:59 Both of you, can it with the pings
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:59:44 Cake, can you try it all at once instead of in bits?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:01:47 Alright, rocket truck (Not specifically the katyusha, I think), cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:02:02 What do you want for it that I had to be pinged for it that you don't have?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:02:33 That's not a Kat, this is a Kat
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:02:34 https://defencyclopedia.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/katyushas.png?w=1018&h=486&crop=1
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:03:02 The rack is too small and narrow basically
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:03:10 The Kat isn't the only rocket truck you know
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:04:16 Rule 2, not gonna warn but still
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:04:38 ... Welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:04:59 Still, try to not use euphemisms
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:05:27 If someone provokes you, no, but if it's uncalled for, yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:05:47 It's generally seen as an insult, that's why
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:06:15 ... As soon as the context goes off-screen I'm going to clamp down on this, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:08:57 Here's a challenge: Make a reasonable fighter, something you'd take into battle and be happy to fly in, not a tiny deathtrap or an absurdly huge target box
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:11:15 With the criteria that it can be hit heavily, yet still perform fine, is highly maneuverable, has a thin target profile on 2/3 of it's sides and can retaliate with a good amount of firepower?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:12:41 A thin target profile means it's hard to hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:13:02 Good example of all of that:
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:13:24 This was back before paint
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:13:35 Yet it's still a reliable fighter, even without the rockets, yet with rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:14:32 Simply put, it's fast, clocking at about 450, very durable, the old MK1 taking about 70-80% damage while still remaining fully operational, it's got a thin profile on the sides, and it's got focused and wide firepower
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:16:58 Totten, I don't think you understand durable ... See how every part on my fighter is connected by at least two other parts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:17:28 Even if you rip a giant gaping hole in the wing, it's still going to be linked together
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:17:46 No offense but I think you'll butcher it, but it's up to you
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:22:25 Totten, can you not, for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:23:02 You literally horked out a "suggestion" to end suggestions, then you come over here like some special little snowflake to make a suggestion that's been made billions of times
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:23:48 Then put it in <#507673335816126509> or upvote someone who's already stated that, in this case, the latter ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:25:23 ... I literally said upvote someone that already suggested it and don't put it in <#507673335816126509> via stating "in this case, the latter"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:25:38 Put it in <#498473314445033472> , Rick's the dev, he'll get to it when he can
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:26:55 Totten, for fuck's sake, we're not your slaves, we don't have to pick for you, you're an individual, pick for yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:27:12 Then make one up yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:27:44 Not yet, planned for the future though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:27:53 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:28:27 Good luck not making it a fucking cube
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:28:51 You have yet to impress me to be honest, namely because I see a general cube shape in all of your creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:28:57 COLLIN!
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:29:15 For fuck's sake, let me just
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:29:48 I'm including euphamisms, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:30:02 So none of that, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:30:31 I'm sorry if I seem a bit extra, pissy, today, I got pissed off to hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:30:57 TLDR: Mass arguments
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:31:14 Real life, I'd rather not say
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:34:13 I'm signing off, Orange, if you're reading this, take over
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:19:50 It seems flimsy
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:21:14 (Current) Mother of all solid superfighters
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:21:38 Sweeny, flying cars are actually easy, you just strap on plane parts to a car
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:22:25 "you just strap plane parts to a car", you think I don't mean some form of thrust as well?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:23:10 I've literally done that before, just bolting on a pair of wings, thrusters, and then next thing you know I had a flying "car" (It was actually a tank, not a car that I modified)
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:24:19 Sweeny, if you want to impress us, do something like what Mxdanger did
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:26:09 Totten, he doesn't HAVE to add your suggestion, now quit pinging people, not everyone's lenient about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:26:59 Have you seen Empire explode about it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:27:09 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:27:21 Read <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:27:39 Totten ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:29:07 Right, clearing this up, fungamer, try making it spin, a spinning object doesn't like to fall over, that's how bicycles tend to be so stable when moving
Totten, that's because you forwent my suggestion to upvote a system, and instead just wanted to be special by posting yours, which is what floods the chat in the first place
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:29:35 That's why we did the whole submissions/suggestions system we have now, where you submit it, because people keep on filling up the chat ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:30:06 For fuck's sake, TOTTEN!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:30:45 I literally just typed out a minute or two ago WHY resurfacing an idea multiple times was a bad idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:32:03 Long story short totten I am very fucking tired and frustrated at events that have happened yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:33:34 Totten ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:33:40 PICK ONE, OR BETTER YET, PICK BOTH
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:33:56 For the love of fuck, you filled up the chat about 10 times WITH YOUR CONSTANT REQUESTS ON WHAT TO BUILD
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:34:24 If you can't decide, do them both!
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:39:32 Check <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:40:07 Try manually picking your save slot instead of having it auto-pick
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:41:44 The complexity, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:41:57 Totten, that's not the worst part
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:42:48 Homboor, because you're basically halucinating when you've got building server bullets ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:43:02 No joke, bullets are clientside, so only you see them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:43:05 So nobody fights back
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:43:18 If people started fighting back, they'd roll your face
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:43:49 ... The red rounds are what's being registered by the server, yellow is clientside
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:44:02 So if it's red, to others it's yellow, but it's there
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:44:38 Knowing you, no, it wouldn't
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:44:58 I will point out those cubes you freaking build
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:45:19 Nah, it wouldn't be unless he actually made the wings move Dust
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:45:58 Too easy infact
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:47:02 For fuck's sake Totten, quit it with your ADDICTION of the Rebel Blockade runner
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:47:48 You're literally spamming the same creation over and over again trying to get people's opinions on it, when our group opinion repeatedly is "No"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:47:59 That's easy Dust
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:48:49 Venators are easy, I saw them a few times ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:49:26 Make the top one, the guns and wings both need to be able to move in the same manner, rear turret doesn't have to move
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:49:39 Note: The large guns DO move infact, just not alot
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:50:02 Make THAT, with the set criteria, AND make don't butcher it, and I'll be impressed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:13 ....
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:14 Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:17 For fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:24 I SAID THIS!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:25 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/511190577174544394/latest.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:52:48 Then you aren't going to impress me totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:53:13 If you won't build the ARC, you aren't a good builder, I can already visualize how to build it infact, and I swear I've seen someone build it before
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:01 How about no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:04 And no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:15 And again, n- mmmm, still no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:16 And no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:31 If you want to impress us Totten, make something that requires effort to build rather than purely time
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:33 Again, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:54:48 Motors require extreme effort to work with, as I'll cite Ignacioel for
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:55:14 Do you realize how much of a damn I don't give? Bigger doesn't mean better, plus you tend to scale down big things, and scale up small things to gross proportions
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:55:21 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:00 That's out of his league, but if he built that I'd be impressed to hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:11 It's not a ship ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:17 Or, is it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:35 If you can build it without omitting the specs on it totten, I'll be impressed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:56:40 Note: WITHOUT OMITTING SPECS
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:57:02 Meaning you need to make the turrets and guns retract and some doors on the front
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:57:37 "Boring" how about how absolutely easy and cube-like your ideas are totten?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:06 May I direct your attention to ignacioel's creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:07 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/508508805580193792/e06017e8177d8ef382ac637d72511d12.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:11 THIS impresses me
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:58:43 ... You're the person that's gonna build the Death Star and have it blown up to hell aren't you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:59:19 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:59:56 I give up with you Totten, you keep on building these "art projects", while we keep on working on impressive creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:00:17 Ones that actually have some moving parts or require effort to make moving
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:00:48 Very simple builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:00:54 Infact, I'd say cubes more than builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:18 Again, how about everything from Star Trek can sod off, with the exception of one ship
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:24 Aka: **NO**
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:44 Again, with the exception of one ship
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:01:50 Also, spaceships done wrong are stupidly lame
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:03:17 If you keep all the specs, including retractable weaponry and landing ramps, AND the ability to fly (Judging from it's hull design and game origin), yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:04:12 Here's the one ship from Star Trek that'll impress me, and you need to keep the wing motion in
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:04:14 https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/sto_gamepedia/thumb/4/48/Scimitar_Warbird.png/1200px-Scimitar_Warbird.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:04:24 Er, whops
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:04:29 https://pwimages-a.akamaihd.net/www/4a/15/4a15db95d7d8a63bd4dc1595ea78c4a11372717224.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:04:46 That's the only ship from Star Trek I'll take from you totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:05:05 "Easy", HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT IT DOES!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:05:34 If you can't make it shift from point 1 to point 2, as I've pointed out, and have to build 2 separate creations, that's as good as nothing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:05:46 And to be fully honest I expect him to build that, considering his level of "skill" many times
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:06:11 Alright then, prove me wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:06:46 I've decided to take a break after my superfighter ate up a good chunk of my life
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:06:58 Because getting that thing to actually fly and maneuver was a piece of crap
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:07:11 This thing is as maneuverable as the next thing by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:07:18 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:07:25 Those two things, are EQUALLY AS MANEUVERABLE
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:07:27 Top one
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:07:48 First of all totten, you're both blind and dumb
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:08:04 Second of all, I actually took alot of effort into engineering that thing so it flies perfectly straight
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:08:35 Not bad chudy
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:09:28 Hey, at least he's somewhat creative
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:10:00 Totten, if any of the mechanisms are missing then you forefit, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:10:10 That means those turrets have to actually retract and pop out, AND act like turrets
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:10:20 Then you're building 3 different sized blocks, plain and simple
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:10:27 Unimpressive to say the very least
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:12:04 ... We'd better see those turrets and guns and they'd better retract totten, otherwise I can literally see how to "build" it already, just 3 rectangular prisms
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:27:20 Well, ever since missiles were added, 1X1 blocks aren't the best against them, but for guns? Yeah, they're pretty freaking good
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:27:33 To the point where the most survivable craft use the smallest parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:27:50 At least, if I'm not really out of date by this point
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:29:25 I'd say add spikes to the hull
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:29:52 Actually, smaller craft do well against them, at least in the test server they did well
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:33:37 It seems to simply dislodge blocks, similar to how a vanilla Roblox explosion happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:33:48 I'm willing to guess no Phoenix, sorry, try server hopping to see
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:15 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:34:44 Ablative style armoring?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:50:52 Thaaat's what I had to deal with in the test server ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:51:13 I'm saying I had to deal with it in the test server
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 15:53:45 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, don't forget that
help 2018-11-11 15:55:28 Center of lift's too far back, push it forwards
bug-reports 2018-11-11 16:06:23 The issue they must be having is that they can't cram a half block in there
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:15:40 In the test server, I built a little plane that could fire missiles in all except the side directions, including rear, above (useless), bellow, and multiple infront
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:17:44 Macross missile massecre immediately to the face?

creations-chat 2018-11-11 20:08:19 Sorta see some of the similarities, right

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:40:42 Right, everyone break it up, break it the hell up now
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:41:00 There was, you missed it Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:41:37 Probably when the server hits 1K people
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:41:46 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:42:56 ... I'll just keep my eye on the server
general 2018-11-11 20:43:28 Then revive it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:44:08 Moderator ain't just a shiny badge, imagine it to the server's closest equivalent of a police badge
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:44:47 It's a "cool shiny" badge of authority
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:45:09 Ehhh, I'll count discussion of the server as on-topic
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:45:23 Nice job Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:45:41 Hello_Guest412590
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:46:20 Hawkinq, it was made a while ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:46:32 Back before we had an abundance of parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:47:15 Hawk, look at how planes are shaped
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:47:30 Also because apparently the admin/mod thing is slightly busted
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:48:25 Right, for Hawk: Planes, even in Plane Crazy, tend to be flat, hence the lower height limit
About in-game admins: Apparently the admin/mod script went done didly deadified
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:48:37 Dust, search for my suggestion to dynamically add slots
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:49:16 __**"any means necessary"**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:49:23 So use anything within the entire Plane Crazy library
creations-chat 2018-11-11 20:50:28 How about make a hybrid of a tank bus?
bug-reports 2018-11-11 20:53:29 Roblox's color system
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:53:47 Fox ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:53:54 How would you like it if I spawn camped you with missiles?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:05 Infact, how would you like it if I did that, and every server you came on I spawncamped you with missiles?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:25 Exactly, now cut the crap, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:32 "Extra challenge" ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:54:52 Last person that tried to give off the "extra challenge" bullcrap turned out to lash out at the entire server
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:55:01 And then got muted, and then ragequit
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 20:57:43 Fox was apparently trolling a server with missiles, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:05:29 Hawkinq, DMs, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:07:41 ARC-130
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:07:51 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:10:40 Be satisfied with the parts you have Dust, we only had 1X2 and 1X1 wedges back in the day, and 1X2 wing sections
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:11:55 I always ask before testing my destructive creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:03 And if they don't respond or say no, I don't bother them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:10 If they say yes, THEN I blast them to bits
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:17 Otherwise I restrain myself, unlike what you seem to think Fox
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:26 Oy
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:12:32 None of that Dust
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:13:20 Because it's a bug that hasn't been patched out yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:14:07 Fox, you don't get it, it's a BUG, A GLITCH
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:14:20 And quite frankly Fox if they do a server shutdown then that'll get alot of people angry due to save losses
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:14:31 I'll call you Turismo Turismo_Fox, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:15:34 The main reason I don't is because Creep sounds like an insult
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:15:40 But whatever, you said it and I'll log it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:11 Creep, if you try to backstab me later, I took a picture of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:16:14 Oy, Theta, none of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:08 Anyways, Creep, just don't use rockets, it's abusing a glitch, and a particularly obnoxious one at that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:17:30 Rockets are patched out in newer servers, but in older ones they blow up creations in the build area
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:18:23 When a dev does it, it's probably to test it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:00 WHATEVER, it's an unintentional piece of something
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:19:59 Alright then
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:21:36 Thiiis is gonna give me a headache, I'm staying out of this
creations-chat 2018-11-11 21:44:31 Pretty impressive to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-11 21:44:45 Although, if it's supposed to be a combat craft, a bit fragile
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 21:51:47 Wait, Sneaky? The heck happened?
help 2018-11-11 23:46:46 I think larger creations have less of an effect compared to smaller ones
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:50:10 It seems to affect larger craft less than smaller ones, at least, from what I can tell
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:51:10 My 1K superfighter has a tilt, but it's so minor that unless I afk for an hour, it doesn't bother me at all, even while trying to land on a carrier
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:51:49 I've got a yawwards tilt, not a rolling tilt
bug-reports 2018-11-11 23:52:16 Flame, it's not balancing mistakes, I checked ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 23:59:42 There's no re-coupler yet Theta
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 23:59:51 So sadly you can't re-weld blocks once you've decoupled them
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 23:59:55 And trust me, it's really hard to do
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:00:00 Press R, T and Y
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:00:41 By recoupler I mean a decoupler that re-connects to the decoupled block
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:03:23 Nice, now try making the Steredenn fighter I showed you earlier
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:03:48 Ehhh, why not?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 00:04:01 Ah, alright
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:32:22 Ignacioel, for fuck's sake, quit leaving everyone else in the dust, like seriously, what's next? AI via blocks?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:33:03 Oh god what have I done?
help 2018-11-12 03:33:13 Blue circle vs orange/yellow circle
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:34:19 I mean, you've made the Grabber, a crab truck, a cargo variant of my superfighter, you would've earned modeler like 10 times over by this point I think
help 2018-11-12 03:35:15 The heck? Those shouldn't be far enough to cause problems
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:35:48 Next thing we know you're gonna get a full hoverbike system
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:36:04 The thing that got you inventor in the first place
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:36:51 Transforming fighter, like in Steredenn, or a mech/fighter, like in Macross
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:37:29 I mean, the battleship is massive and impressive, don't get me wrong
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:45:13 Knowing ignacioel, he probably is
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:46:40 Trollgeinuous, what are you using as a reference?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:47:13 If it's the same thing then it's not one's copying the other, it's that both are taking inspiration from the same source
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:49:25 Well, trollgeinuous, you're both mimicing the same design, so you're gonna have the same result
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:52:49 trollgeinuous, the engine's stouter, the bridge has a longer spinal section, and he appears to make the side go wider
creations-chat 2018-11-12 03:53:48 You could layer it with disconnectors and fake an impact
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:54:45 Dude, trollgeinuous, I literally said the rear engine is stouter
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:55:43 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:55:50 You're basing it off the SAME CREATION
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:56:28 Then compare your creation to a republic cruiser
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:56:29 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/511386194383470593/latest.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:56:33 Blockade runner
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:56:57 So are you building this trollgeinuous?
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:56:58 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/47/Rebels-TantiveIVConceptArt-CroppedBackground.png/revision/latest?cb=20150215073634
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:57:14 Because if so you got the engines and bridge entirely wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:58:39 You literally admitted, the only differences are a lack of side cannons, a front mounted weapon, a radiator, and a new paint scheme
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:59:08 You're building THE SAME THING TROLLGEINUOUS
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:59:13 OF COURSE IT'S THE SAME THING
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 03:59:48 I don't think we need to continue it, I've seen copiers before, but this is not copying
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 04:02:36 Just file it under "Refit" and let him be, if he starts claiming to be the first then I'll flyswat him, alright?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:02:48 Other creations' interactions are weird
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:03:07 Like, I've parked my superfighter on someone's carrier a long while ago, and they wound up bouncing me into orbit
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:06:34 Credit to Snyfort, this is basically what happened
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:06:35 https://ytcropper.com/cropped/2n5be8fc213d989
creations-chat 2018-11-12 04:12:09 Yeeeeeup, pung into high orbit
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 04:42:17 How about, no
general 2018-11-12 19:33:49 RIP, F for respects? Alright,
http://images.landofnod.com/is/image/LandOfNod/Letter_Giant_Enough_F_231843_LL
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:38:47 My current combat fighter clocks 450, it's not that bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-12 19:48:24 Theta, we've already mentioned it in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:59:56 GUYS!!!!
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:00:01 Emergency slowmode time
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:00:22 Or, not, but seriously
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:00:48 INFERNO!
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:00:53 God damn it
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:44:07 Nice design, weapon positioning for the guns are a bit narrow though Star
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:03 I think real life, and even then you might wanna add the turrets
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:10 Otherwise it's impressive
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:46:17 Like, one that actually flies in real life
general 2018-11-12 21:56:31 Lots of landing gears, that's how
general 2018-11-12 22:00:54 Parse over <#490305554556911646>
general 2018-11-12 22:01:18 So long as it fits under that criteria, you're free to post whatever you want
general 2018-11-12 22:01:26 Also, try to keep it within server topics
general 2018-11-12 22:04:45 Er, more context?
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:05:00 Steredenn Tempest (The yellow/black fighter)
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:06:53 Jaws, ignore it
general 2018-11-12 22:07:06 Welp
general 2018-11-12 22:07:49 If they say it's a "tutorial", then he's obviously entirely wrong right off the bat
general 2018-11-12 22:10:10 Excuse me while I make him royally shit his pants, or if Rick's feeling up to it
general 2018-11-12 22:12:55 I'm gonna spook him with a message
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:14:30 This single section answers it's self totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:14:56 Also from what I heard, no Miner, although stay around, most of the people are nice and are willing to give you tips
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:15:21 Bet you 50 bucks it's either a brick or a brick with something tied to it Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:16:16 Build the statue with guns on his head for "eyes", and a moving arm with a rocket on it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:17:30 Totten, show us then
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:18:21 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/480169004816924682/506220805827461140/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:18:21 I'm willing to bet it's either this
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:18:27 Or this
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:18:29 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504630474853974032/506212267734466590/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:18:56 It's a brick ... You've glued a plane onto a brick
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:19:10 Actually, a "plane" onto a brick, more like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:19:54 What do you think of the DMed suggestion Deception?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:34:57 He doesn't have to unless he wants ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:35:28 If I had to guess I'd say it qualifies for advanced
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:37:54 I mean, the fusilage alone is probably something like ~100-150, maybe ~175 if you wanna push it? Not to mention I see space for internals, alongside the actual wings and such
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:39:13 ... I'm giving an estimate without the part count, OF COURSE I'M JUDGEMENTAL YA DUMB SHIT
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:39:21 Now piss off and leave me the hell alone
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:40:10 ... For the love of god, thiiis is why I'm sick of all of this to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:40:44 Do I need to point out this totten?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:41:00 Yeah, I have a legitimate reason to be pissed off at you
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:41:09 Infact, quite a few legitimate reasons
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:41:36 Dragon, he keeps on pissing me off to high hell, what do you want from me exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:41:56 NOT YOU TOTTEN
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:43:00 I don't get mad at some random halfwit throwing a pile of trash at me, but when said halfwit does it repeatedly, then it gets irritating, and no I'm not saying totten's a halfwit
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:43:06 ... Good point Imperial
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:43:09 Moving to <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-11-13 01:43:36 It ain't easy to ignore when it bloats up in your face repeatedly
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:44:51 Hey, see? Told you, applied for the 250+ part rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:47:41 Dragon, can you please stop spamming "zoo wee mama"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:48:27 ... Seriously guys?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:48:41 At least it's bearable when you guys do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:49:01 OY!
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:49:47 ... Hawkinq, remember that conversation we had?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:50:45 ... That's what I hate about you totten, "who's the kindest person in the server, totally me", freaking hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:51:04 Can I get a pin to pop that ego please?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:51:24 Dragon, no offense but you do have your moments, remember way back in the past?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:51:31 Ain't the nicest, but you do at least try
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:51:51 Dragging this to <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-11-13 01:52:04 From <#384021699466756107> , that sounds like a certain presidential someone honestly ...
general 2018-11-13 01:52:55 From what I witnessed it, you like to try to infinity +1 people
general 2018-11-13 01:53:05 Totten, not Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 01:53:23 Hawkinq, <#497142796961054721> if you wanna continue this
general 2018-11-13 01:53:45 Responding to Hawkinq in <#384021699466756107> , when you get pushed a certain point, you tend to do it
general 2018-11-13 01:53:57 Totten, don't go philosophical on us
general 2018-11-13 01:54:48 Just how am I bullying you exactly?
general 2018-11-13 01:55:20 Or do I need to point out how you thought the entire server was bullying you at one point because you suggested one suggestion that had only one niche that was already filled
general 2018-11-13 01:55:39 Wait, that's you kiwi?
general 2018-11-13 01:56:15 Oh, huh, on it Kiwi
general 2018-11-13 01:56:40 Er, full username/what you want to be called Kiwi?
general 2018-11-13 01:56:51 And Totten, the feeling's far, far more than mutual
general 2018-11-13 01:57:08 ... I will shuffle through <#491710474786832394> and find it Dragon, don't force me to
general 2018-11-13 01:57:15 It's fine Empire
general 2018-11-13 01:57:28 Fixed Kiwi, try it now
general 2018-11-13 01:58:27 The problem is it's 2 people trying to chat with me, and the way Discord DMs work is that only friends are allowed group DMs
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:58:36 Er, sorry! In a moment
creations-chat 2018-11-13 01:59:29 Lansink, look at your ranks
general 2018-11-13 02:02:49 
general 2018-11-13 02:02:58 And I'm busy gathering the whole story still
general 2018-11-13 02:04:11 
general 2018-11-13 02:04:21 
general 2018-11-13 02:04:30 
general 2018-11-13 02:05:11 
general 2018-11-13 02:07:18 You refused to accept other people's opinions on it ...
help 2018-11-13 02:07:44 Can you use streamable for ease of viewing for the rest of us?
help 2018-11-13 02:08:06 Thank ye kindly
general 2018-11-13 02:08:31 Empire, this isn't gonna work
bug-reports 2018-11-13 02:11:40 Well, it is a bug, pfff, nice one
bug-reports 2018-11-13 02:24:51 You'd think you have enough sense to realize that now that the mod recruitment's over, you're no longer under my name, right?
bug-reports 2018-11-13 02:24:57 Moving to <#497142796961054721> , again
general 2018-11-13 02:25:17 From <#498473314445033472> , Dragon, you're no longer under my name, now quit acting like a mod
general 2018-11-13 02:25:39 Nice one Turismo
general 2018-11-13 02:26:48 You'd think of the way I treated you it'd be highly obvious ...
general 2018-11-13 02:28:14 I literally gave you a chance at becoming a mod ...
general 2018-11-13 02:28:19 He's got plenty of context
general 2018-11-13 02:28:34 Anyways, "You always bullied me", I gave you the biggest chance you had at becoming a mod possible
general 2018-11-13 02:29:09 I literally tried taking you under my wing as basically a branch of mine, letting you "micromod" under my name, and you think that's bullying?
general 2018-11-13 02:30:37 ...  If you seriously thought that didn't give you a chance, it's because you blew it
general 2018-11-13 02:32:57 I did, rewind back to <#498473314445033472> to see where it started off at Orange
general 2018-11-13 02:39:06 What kind of bird?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 03:01:41 Show us the part count?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 03:02:04 Wait, can it even fly? I'm noticing the center of lift and center of mass are so far apart, with the center of lift in the back
creations-chat 2018-11-13 03:03:06 Ehhhh, can you get it in the air?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 03:03:28 Just take a picture of it off the ground
general 2018-11-13 03:07:11 It's on the edge of NSFW, but better safe than sorry
general 2018-11-13 06:05:03 Other way around Dragon, bottom to the top
creations-chat 2018-11-13 06:08:45 Which ones are pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) and roll (Obvious)?
general 2018-11-13 06:43:02 Oy, rule 2
general 2018-11-13 06:43:12 You guys mind cleaning it up?
general 2018-11-13 06:43:29 If you clean it up yourselves, no warnings, alright?
general 2018-11-13 06:43:50 That means deleting all the chats, starting from the "Abusive dad" part
general 2018-11-13 06:44:07 60 seconds, if I don't see progress I'll do it myself, but you'll get a warning, got it?
general 2018-11-13 06:45:07 Alright, you're both clear
general 2018-11-13 06:45:37 Just try to keep rule 2 in mind, that's the most rock solid and enforcable rule, so it's the easiest to get caught in
general 2018-11-13 06:46:03 It went a bit too far, that's the issue
general 2018-11-13 06:47:12 If you're fine with it, take it to DMs, but if we get complaints that someone's spreading stuff, well we've gotta clamp down on that, after all, this is a Roblox community server
general 2018-11-13 06:55:46 Not controversial, __**YET**__, but you're walking on the line
general 2018-11-13 07:05:15 Dragon ...
general 2018-11-13 07:05:37 I'm gonna play it safe and just erase tha-
general 2018-11-13 07:05:40 Nevermind
general 2018-11-13 07:06:47 Immediate accusations of me, of course ...
general 2018-11-13 07:07:09 So you WANT to get in trouble?
general 2018-11-13 07:07:19 If not, play it safe
general 2018-11-13 07:07:36 Ever heard "Better safe than sorry"? Yeah, better safe than breaking rule 2
general 2018-11-13 07:08:49 I'm on the fence on it breaking rule 2, hence why I wanted to remove it
general 2018-11-13 07:09:09 So that you didn't get in trouble if someone wasn't as forgiving, but apparently someone is, since they didn't bother warning you
general 2018-11-13 07:10:25 We already had to nail down Hawkinq because of euphemisms, so
general 2018-11-13 07:11:19 Dragon, I'm not getting into a "Mods are bullying me" argument again, it's breaking rule 2 because it's tripped past the line of euphemism, now end of story
general 2018-11-13 07:11:32 I'm not answering any more questions, got it?
general 2018-11-13 07:15:37 What your parents said was a euphemism, similar to the one you and mutentender fumbled into earlier
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:19:03 It was in <#504436696021204992> to, so it would've been permanent if I wasn't there
general 2018-11-13 07:19:12 Now do you get the picture?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:19:25 Well, if a mod wasn't th- what?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:19:47 DM me it?
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:20:30 Well, huh, Discord's weird sometimes
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:20:59 Oy, I scrapped his thing, no need to bother him anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-13 07:21:49 Right, you're here, fungamer, takeover so I can sleep, goodnight, you're in charge of making sure nothing blows up
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:26:23 Ffff- whyyyy no sleep? He's saying if you break any rules, now or in the future, you will be punished, and that includes sending illicit stuff through DMs to other involuntary members, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:26:46 Now sleep, I'm really freaking tired
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:27:02 Hawkinq, it's a reminder
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:27:23 Then can you stop painting yourself as a target? We can see what you've erased you know
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:28:10 muten didn't break any rules, YET, but there's a reason we need to show people these things, and that's either they've been broken before, or the consequence of them being broken even once is so severe that we need to preemptively prevent it
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:28:26 So if we remind you of the rules, that's why, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:28:51 Just incase something was happening in the DMs that was against the rules
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:29:24 Again, just incase, if people were perfect, none of this would be needed, as it stands, the community's Roblox, so what can we do?
general 2018-11-13 07:29:42 I already self-destructed it and I'm not bringing it back up gamer
plane-crazy 2018-11-13 07:30:07 Now I'm going to sleep, direct any further questions to any of the other mods, and please don't ping them, nobody likes a ping
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:33:09 Applications were already closed, and they have been for a bit, wait until we hit 1K members, then the next applications will open
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:34:43 You're just trolling me now Dragon, quit it ... you already admitted it's tough and that mods won't pay attention, it's literally 6-7 lines (7-8 now) above the current chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:36:16 To respond to Dragon, you're feigning ignorance after admitting and acknowledging the fact that it's extremely difficult, in an attempt to run up to my face and repeat the same statement over and over again
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:36:48 I'm not responding to any further comment by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:37:13 G'night potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:38:45 Don't bother Orange, if he continues it, then give him the warning
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:39:22 Potatoe, don't do a me like yesterday, sleep, you're gonna screw up your sleep schedule
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:39:44 Let's see?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:40:03 I, don't think that'd really work out
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:40:32 It's up to Xpert and the group consensus, post a picture and the steps for it and I'll see what the others think
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:40:49 Both of you knock it off please, and I mean **BOTH** of you
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:41:09 I'll make sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:41:29 Tank, take it from me and just drop it for now
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:41:56 He's irked in the same way I'm irked at you, he's just further behind in the cycle compared to me right now
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:43:29 Dragon, I will shoot down people with the freaking BFG if they harass other people, he might be a bit angry, but he's not doing it unwarranted, which is one of my big considerations
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:44:04 Got it, send them either through <#504436696021204992> where people will see them and know they're yours, or DM me and I'll see it through
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:44:17 Also, sniper conversation in <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-11-14 02:44:28 From <#384021699466756107> , no need to snipe if you hit everything in your shot equally, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:44:51 Tank, <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-11-14 02:44:58 It's just for consistency tank, sorry
general 2018-11-14 02:45:23 Or, DMs work to
general 2018-11-14 02:46:04 I don't play PF because every FPS that I've seen on Roblox has some form of pay to win or excessive grind mechanic
general 2018-11-14 02:48:06 That's sorta EA's logic, you know, the company that's been under criminal investigation for refusing to remove pay to win lootbox mechanics from within their games?
general 2018-11-14 02:48:19 "A 25% increase isn't powerful in a bad player's hands", what about the one that's good?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:50:40 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:54:35 Hey hey hey I said **WE'D** discuss it, I can't act independently from the mods on a server change ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:55:01 Anyways, it's ultimately up to Xpert to decide, I might put in a good word, but there's no garuntee, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:56:11 He wants us to make it as the default tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:56:19 To be honest, it's simple, but I'd say, a bit too simple
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:58:10 That one's too unstable in the rear
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:59:32 trollgeinuous, it needs to be a simple plane that demonstrates all the mechanics and is very easy to fly
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 02:59:45 And I mean absurdly simple and absurdly easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:00:51 Runaway vehicle Deception?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:01:52 Uhhhhh, (Generic flashbacks to ignacioel wrecking me in terms of creativity)
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:03:39 Trollgeinuous, right, here's the deal, make tutorials on tweaking imbalanced aircraft, helicopters, VTOL engines and turrets, and fill the criteria we mentioned before
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:04:44 All of those need to be simple to build for ease of copying, utilize all the tools and possibilities, and be simple enough that someone who's never even touched a computer, let alone Plane Crazy, can fly
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:04:59 Got it trollgeinuous?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:05:12 I never said tutorialization was easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:05:34 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:06:35 Slideshow videos, show each bit step by step
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:06:59 It needs to be simple to build mind you, or simple to replicate, so no internals, got it?
general 2018-11-14 03:09:05 Blood gore and stuff, I'm gonna axe it, but no warning, alright kiwi?
general 2018-11-14 03:09:23 Better
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:23:03 If they're in the Discord, yes, but otherwise we don't have in-game power just yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 03:34:17 It's a special thing for something he's done
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 04:12:20 Collin, how even?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 05:04:03 Saw it, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 06:04:56 Lemon, you've got too much lift in the back, bump the wings forward
help 2018-11-14 12:16:17 It's probably Roblox acting weird, another game for me said that, so I don't think it's only Plane Crazy for everyone, rather everyone has a problem game
help 2018-11-14 12:17:32 Like using 3 people in the server as an example, Orangeskii might have problem with Phantom Forces, C4RAB might have problems with Jailbreak, and Dusttiiii might have problems with Plane Crazy as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:19:22 Can you push them out of the way?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:19:57 Alright, that's just called communities
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:44:07 Punt them off with your own creation, or make something so heavy that they ping off of it and into orbit
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 12:56:34 Gonna spook him
bug-reports 2018-11-14 13:33:40 When a plane hits the bottom of the world in arena mode, it glitches it out for everyone
bug-reports 2018-11-14 13:37:54 Arena guns can still hit the player model, which means you can absoluetly ruin yourself if your gun placement is too close to the cockpit
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:20:38 Use Streamable please, it makes it easier to watch
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:15 Use it like this

creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:27 Er, wait
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:28 https://streamable.com/eqiow
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:31 There we go
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:35 There's your video now
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:27:56 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:41:39 Check the pinned stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:49:53 Gonna check it with the others
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:50:30 I personally say yes, because nobody's built an obby before, and nobody's built an object contained within a self-expanding cube that can in theory be compressed together
creations-chat 2018-11-14 15:51:09 Now carry it in a truck and I'm willing to be 100% yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:55:04 Glitches, that's the one hint I can give
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 15:56:03 Well, there's a crapton of people that got it, soooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:00:37 You got it kiri
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:00:47 That's 12 digits, Light Speed's 10 last time I counted
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:14 E+(Number) means (Number) digits
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:33 It's just a quick review for anyone who doesn't know
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:01:55 Current record's 19 digits, so high that I'm pretty much only counting how many digits there are now
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:02:15 I wonder what happens if someone hits 100 digits
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:47:04 You need upvotes for replicators, and you need to model it based off of a real life object
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:47:09 And by real life object, I mean specifics
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:47:48 Not just "Generic boat", but something like "Battleship Bismark" or "Prinz Eugen"
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:48:42 And don't be vague on it, try to add as much detail as possible, not only will it be more applicable, but people like detail
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:56:49 Naval, air or land?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:57:42 PFFF, well
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:58:09 I'm, not sure anything's new on it, but, hey, modeler at least, nobody's made a wrecking ball, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:58:15 500+ blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:59:18 It wouldn't have counted anyways kiri, I remember people showed me cranes before
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:59:37 What more's a wrecking ball than a crane with a big iron/steel/whatever ball on the end of it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:12:54 Seems like Roblox is just having a seizure or something, I had like 5 completely gamecrashing errors on the loading screen trying to jump into Notoriety to check how the new update was coming along, and one server on another game had ping so high that it was almost 20X what I had witnessed before this storm
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:32:19 How is it broken?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:32:49 That's cilentside, not serverside
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:33:15 If it was serverside, people would be complaining, as it stands, you look like nothing more than an annoying dunce doing that, because you're the only one that witnesses it, nobody else experiences it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:33:32 Like seriously, people do that alot and I just wind up smacking them out of the air with a giant flyswatter
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:33:50 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:34:11 On another note, I actually took advantage of that with my push tank, back when it was still alive
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:45:07 It's not spelled fule, it's fuel
creations-chat 2018-11-14 17:52:47 Point out which others I have to check out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:52:53 Blame Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:53:07 C4rab, none of that please
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:53:28 Don't ask, it'd be better if you didn't know
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:53:33 Well, halfway better
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:53:41 Rick's adding new sphere wheels as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:53:55 ... I'll let that one sit C4RAB
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:54:13 Reposting his things
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:54:14 https://i.gyazo.com/cad6efef53d0eb6fcabe9f58aa63f5f9.gif
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:54:17 https://gyazo.com/df715cde688afee86551ff11e43612fa
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:54:22 Tadaaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:54:34 Sphere wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:56:05 CAN YOU PLEASE QUIT SPAMMING THINGS OUT GAMER!? Seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:56:22 This is the second time you did it, I had to clean up after your first time
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:56:39 Blame Roblox kiri
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:56:51 How about no yousuf, rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:57:04 Even the term's a bit, touchy
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:57:13 So please try not to mention it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:58:31 More like RYNO/BFG fusion locked and loaded
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 17:59:41 It's easy to recognize, has the worst impact on anything not advertising it's self as adult only (including this server), and generally has very little to no actual reason to keep it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:00:08 I mean, have you seen what happened when Roblox ignored hackers? They were on the news for "nsfw" stuff, that's how the whole mandatory filtering enabled thing came along
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:00:31 That's why I'm cracking down on it so hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:02:23 <#497142796961054721> with this stuff if you don't mind?
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:02:41 It's not related to the actual Plane Crazy game
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:02:54 ALRIGHT, NEXT PERSON THAT SAYS STOP JUST TO FILL IT UP I'M GOING TO WHACK TO THE MOON
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:03:22 Kimbo, it's all of Roblox, not just Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:07:22 Glad I didn't use those
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:08:13 I can confirm that's not the case, I think, my MK2 and superfighter don't suffer from tilting
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:08:37 Oh that one, uhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-14 18:09:08 Checking now
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:09:45 Terraria break, be back in a while
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:28:53 I was on a Terraria break, next time, can you please read the <#384021699466756107> chat?
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:29:41 Yeaaahhhh, that's what's limiting you alot kiri
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:23 I think they voted you're inventor-worthy Skaara
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:33 Actually yeah, inventor-worthy
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:30:47 Tada, done
creations-chat 2018-11-14 20:32:59 He made a cube that expands, revealing an obby in the middle of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 20:36:02 So is Roblox it's self, in all of it's entirity, being demolished?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:13 jacob, let me clarify
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:19 GUYS!!!!
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:29 Right, jacob, you're a bit new here, so let me explain what he did and why
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:36 Jacob, just let me explain
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:43 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:22:54 __**LET ME EXPLAIN BEFORE YOU ASSUME STUFF JACOB**__
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:18 How are you supposed to know if you're helping if you don't know what's going on exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:36 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:23:57 Tank, admittedly you're a bit eager to swing the hammer
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:01 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:17 Right, Jacob, DMs, now, rest of you can you please try to calm down while I explain it to him?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:24:56 I think he might've blocked me ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:25:16 He's still in it, he has the roles
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:25:30 ..... Look in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:08 Anyone mind me giving him a warn?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:27 Jacob, then LISTEN UP
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:28:45 I'm dragging this to DMs, not for my own personal sake, but so it's just you and me, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:04 ... Then freaking listen, and it might not be annoying anymore
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:12 And maybe you'd like to open your DMs temporarily?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:23 That's, better, ish
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:51 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:29:53 Jacob
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:30:01 Get to DMs, now, and I'm going to make it easy with you
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:30:17 Get to the DMs, and I'll explain what's going on, so you don't wind up screwing everything up
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:00 ........
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:37 Dragon, he tried to pick on Fanta, and even tried to falsely warn him
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:31:53 If you think that's "bullying", then clearly you've got some screwed up definition of bullying
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:32:38 ... Dragon, just stay out of this, no matter how much explaining I do, you won't get it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:32:58 You have never gotten it infact, so just stay out of these conversations before you burry your nose into a mousetrap
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:10 Jacobboss, then how about you listen up
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:17 And actually acknowledge that you're listening
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:31 You can if you want to stay in the server Dragon
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:33:44 But anyways, do you understand what I mean Jacob?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:04 Riiiight, explanation time
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:18 For roles, which are sorta like award badges, we need block counts most of the time
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:32 If you look in <#473249376223887371> , you may notice a bunch of roles require block counts
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:34:53 ... You don't without permission from a mod, it's so we can tell who you are easily
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:35:34 Anyways, if you look in ranks, many of them require block counts, we can't accurately determine block counts just by counting, as with the size of creations recently, and the various blocks, it's very difficult
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:35:42 So instead what we do is we rely on save slots, which post a block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:36:10 Do you understand somewhat now jacob?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:37:18 That hasn't been a problem yet to be honest, and even then, how would that work out exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:37:45 Making the background transparent wouldn't do anything, because they could just paint a picture of their supposed "super craft"
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:38:08 Taking a picture's very, very hard to do, and would probably cut off a bit of save data, which is pretty important
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:39:21 Server's going through a bit of maintenance currently
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:39:29 So please forgive any bugs and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:39:44 Jacob ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:39:48 Did you not see what I typed out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:40:06 I typed out why people posted those save slots alongside their pictures
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:40:28 TLDR: People do it for the ranks in the <#473249376223887371> channel as proof
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:40:44 Jacob, after what you did before, and what you've still been doing, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:40:56 Also <#497142796961054721> PLEASE GUYS
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:41:29 Jacob, you're still mocking us for attempting to solidify the rules, if you really, REALLY want to post there again, prove you can post creations in a professional manner
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:42:03 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:42:15 Jacob, that's unprofessional, and so you won't be let in, try again within 24 hours
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:42:48 F is an old respect thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:42:55 Like "Press F to pay respects"
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:43:17 __**GUYS, CALM DOWN BEFORE I DRAG SLOWMODE ON HERE**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:45:48 It got a bit too chaotic in here, hence the slowmode
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:46:21 Yeah, the others cranked it down sean
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:46:41 Right, I'm going to turn it off, assuming you guys won't blow up the chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:46:50 If I get too much though, I'm turning it back on, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:46:56 So control yourselves
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:47:13 Slowmode's off
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:47:55 ... Jacob
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:48:23 Right, bringing it to DMs
creations-chat 2018-11-15 00:56:12 Hey! AWACs design, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:57:50 __**RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON NOW!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:58:15 Right, all of you please stop for a moment and explain, WHAT HAPPENED
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:58:20 One at a time
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:58:25 First starting with Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 00:58:48 ... Or, spooky, that works to, just one at a time
help 2018-11-15 01:00:22 I actually did, but that's after he tried harassing me in the DMs
help 2018-11-15 01:00:35 So it's provoked swearing to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:01:40 Totten, can you please not, we've seen your creation and all of it's various repaints like 30 times, at least once daily now
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:09 ... It's technically applying to the rules, so I'll let it stay, but can you please, just condense it into one list?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:12 ....
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:02:51 Now that is actually good Fanta, it's something that's actually built to function, rather than just act as a huge block
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:03:42 I think it's just a pair of wedges, uninteresting
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:03:48 A very large repeating pattern
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:02 Look at Fanta's compared to yours
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:11 His has at least some form of structure and design
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:04:28 ...?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:05:11 Oh what the actual,
creations-chat 2018-11-15 01:06:32 Calm the hell down, we've already taken action
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:08:27 Right, everyone calm down
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:10:22 Ehhh, true Xpert, it would be a bit far to take major revenge against him
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:10:40 Hey, this isn't anarchy ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:11:59 Oy, Totten, don't bug him
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:21:43 TLDR Theta he tried to harass the entire server
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:24:30 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:24:35 Alright, let me explain Theta
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:25:11 Er, ah
help 2018-11-15 01:25:29 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:27:08 So
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:27:10 That prince guy
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:27:13 He was jacob ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:28:11 Orange, don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:28:34 Also, Hawk, you can swear so long as you don't actively try to harass people with it, parse over <#512414682552729601> closely
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:30:02 What Totten? What is it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:30:22 I'm not giving that info away
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:30:37 If you want to know why, CGP Grey Social Security numbers
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:31:09 TLDR: You can guess someone's number, which is basically their American lifeline, if you have their location and age
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:31:18 Totten, I have autism to, now don't use that as an excuse
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:31:33 There's a difference between real autism and the faked excuse kind
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:34:08 One way to get it off of the admin/mods' backs, get verification from Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 01:50:37 He's under supervision from pretty much every mod and admin within their power now
creations-chat 2018-11-15 02:51:16 Warp drive, not speed demon
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:01:10 Show me the vehicle? Ground based ones have X2 block requirements
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:22 Yeah, didn't factor that in?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:49 At the very least you get lag machine, at most you'll get server exterminator
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:04:59 If it flies or is designed for primarily naval transportation, you get exterminator
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:05:03 Otherwise, lag machine
creations-chat 2018-11-15 04:08:24 Ehhhh, alright, I'll judge the final part tomorrow
creations-chat 2018-11-15 06:42:24 It's pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:43:56 They have attempted that before
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:06 Most notably people have made Star Destroyers before
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:44:26 Dude, this is Plane Crazy, if it's within the general realm of reason, it'll probably be able to fly
creations-chat 2018-11-15 18:45:19 Nope
help 2018-11-15 18:54:28 ?
help 2018-11-15 18:54:38 Show me?
help 2018-11-15 18:54:44 DOH! I SEE IT!
help 2018-11-15 18:54:52 Fixed
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:06:00 Er, 1, how many parts? 2: You need to be upvoted as well, 3: The seat's the wrong way around, 4: Your scaling's way off
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:06:22 Quite literally that little wooden thing you see in the middle is the entire seat the person is supposed to sit on
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:07:04 If you want ranks for it, please also include the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:09:17 Er, different views?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:10:25 Post a picture of the save slot, that's a more surefire way of getting the block count
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:10:57 Got it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:13:25 Ranks given
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:14:04 You don't mind if I give negative critique? You did nice with the motors and the cockpit, but there are a couple of things
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:14:32 Like, so you can improve upon it later
help 2018-11-15 19:16:24 To suggest things, do &suggest (Your suggestion)
help 2018-11-15 19:16:31 Within the <#491710474786832394> channel
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:06 Gamer, right, here's the thing, you need to replicate an actual vehicle
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:43 Examples of replicatable vehicles: F-16, B-52, M1A1 Abrams, the Bismarck battleship
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:20:54 It's sort of a silent rule that we didn't think we had to spell out
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:21:20 Just grab a picture of a modern or past vehicle and build something that looks like it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:21:58 And do a bit of research on it, if it's got turrets, we expect them to at least swivel, and if it's got VTOL capabilities, we expect VTOL capabilities in similar ways
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:23:39 Hey, nobody said replicator was easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 19:25:26 Not in-game, but yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:28 I can already see it doesn't fit the 500+ block requirement
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:49 Wait no wrong one
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:27:53 I was thinking modeler/inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:31 If you can get someone else's vote on it, without pressuring them to do so, I suppose you'll get novice
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:38 But for crud's sake, make a plane dude, how hard is it?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:28:56 Get a fighter, WW2 monoplanes tend to be the easiest, and model it in Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:31:41 It'd help if you knew how to spell it out, you even spelled it out correctly in the Roblox save, which brings up a question, was it really you?
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:32:21 Because if so, you knew how to spell it before, infact you nailed it perfectly, yet you screw it up on the Discord server, not even bothering to fix it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:32:53 So let me ask again, are your creations really yours, or are you getting them off of someone else?
general 2018-11-15 19:35:03 DOH! Nevermind
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:36:42 Dude
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:36:59 I'm compelled to NOT upvote it because you're practically in my face about it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:37:54 You're mispelling skateboard again
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:02 ...
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:21 Dude, seriously, give up on these minimal effort builds and put some actual effort into it
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:36 If you didn't notice with my replicator list, we also included land vehicles
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:38:50 But you can't make a generic box and go "fiat", you need to put some EFFORT in
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:39:25 You just put down alot of single blocks and some wheels ... that's not really effort
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:40:09 THIS is effort, 1K+ blocks, all able to fly so comfortably that you can fall asleep at the stick and still fly to your destination, it's effort in engineering and design
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:40:26 Putting down single blocks, that's not effort
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:41:02 ... Gamer, give it up and put some actual effort in, nobody's going to be impressed by "scate" boards
creations-chat 2018-11-15 19:41:14 Unless you can actually make it do a legitimate kickflip or something
creations-chat 2018-11-15 20:14:58 That is just god damn creative oslo, well done
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:15:48 Formation flight?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:16:07 Actually, wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:16:16 Could you in theroy fly in your own formation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:16:25 Like, you build 5 planes and fly them in their own formation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:18:02 Ah, dang it
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:18:17 Let's see?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 20:21:28 Use Streamable for ease of viewing please
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:20:46 Shift around the sizes and such and that'll be even better
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:20:59 I'd say it should be ever so slightly infront, so as to give the nose a bit more lift
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:22:13 Hey, it's picking up speed at a pretty good rate, what'd you think would happen?
help 2018-11-15 21:35:32 Only in arena mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:38:56 Well then, huh
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:45:01 I feel like it ought to be like TerraTech, where the absolute strongest engines require fuel, but the others don't, except more like an afterburner system
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:51:48 Heh, ehhhh, it's really powerful, let's just say that
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:52:56 Like, it's able to turn on a dime, has reverse thrust, is incredibly durable (To the point of surviving a missile scoring a direct hit), and I can load it up on missiles and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:53:01 Also, that's actually pretty nice Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:53:25 Try making your own custom thing Imperial, rather than boeings and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:53:55 Jaws, I said it's pretty nice to Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:54:02 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:54:28 If the meme's stealing craft and posing it as your own I'm going to blast you to kingdome come you know
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:54:59 Ask why someone who's rich steals a diamond ring
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:57:43 It's up to you
creations-chat 2018-11-15 21:58:19 Love the wheelie it does
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:59:42 Counter the wobble?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 21:59:55 Like, as it's wobbling clockwise, turn it counter-clockwise?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:18:35 Blocks people from accessing your build area
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:26:15 Dooooon't ping Mad, seriously, rule 5
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:29:34 I think he was trying to spell something out, but then a random Kermit appeared
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:31:15 You heard him, no leaks means no leaks, if Xpert wants to leak, that's fine, since he owns the server but otherwise no leaks
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:33:47 So you want us just to pop out a random list that may either be oversensitive or undersensitive and not care about the consequences to following it to the period?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:35:20 You're avoiding my question, which was a response to your statement, so you want us to just pop out a random list that may have issues, and we're supposed to not care about the events later?
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:36:52 Because that's answering your request, if we just randomly pop out a half-finished rule, people may interpret a loophole and bypass it, or it may feel oppressive, or fall under the wrong category, and thus wind up having an inferior list compared to the previous one
plane-crazy 2018-11-15 22:39:09 Thanks, I try my best for solid and agreeable arguments when trying to counter someone's statement
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:44:27 Post a picture of the block count, and show your name please
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:45:13 Due to recent copying and picture stealing issues, we've had to implement a new rule that you have to show your username alongside your craft somewhere within the picture
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:45:35 We wouldn't have had to have done this if certain people didn't copy others' creations ... Blame them for ruining it for everyone
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:46:09 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:53:39 Then check to see if others have already suggested your suggestions
creations-chat 2018-11-15 22:54:47 He, went a bit overboard with a suggestions flood
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 00:02:13 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:37:19 Show your username on the screen to prove it's yours?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:38:53 Sadly it's a precaution we had to take after people started stealing other people's images of their creations
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:39:05 Also, Ignacioel, how the heck do you keep on making these things?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:39:45 Cool, doesn't follow the steampunk engineer rank, but it's still pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:40:33 It maintains lift via helium, engines used to maneuver only
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:44:13 ... Paul, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:44:30 Please tell me that's a joke ...
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:46:14 It doesn't have to be serious you know
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:08 Right, clear it up here
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:26 Flame, wargamechap, you're both wrong, it's not a glitch, it's an intentional feature so you can see how much damage you can do
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:53:54 But it's clientside only, meaning only you can can only see how much damage you do
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:54:18 It sent
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:54:31 Flame ...
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:54:39 "Flame, __**wargamechap**__"
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:54:52 I never said plzkilmenow, I said wargamechap
bug-reports 2018-11-16 00:55:57 Wargamechap, don't just bomb around doing that, you only look like an annoying troll if you do
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:57:21 Both pictures sent smokey
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:57:25 On both channels
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:58:12 Welp, that'd explain how you make those things constantly
creations-chat 2018-11-16 00:59:38 I'd love to see an autoloaded coaxial turret, I know someone made an absurdly huge coaxial turret, but I think it was single shot, not autoloaded
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:31 Think a battleship's turret, it's got multiple barrels on it
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:00:54 Also for autoloaders, think of how an assault rifle works
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:01:35 Basically a turret that's magazine fed
help 2018-11-16 01:30:34 We seriously need an in-game mod tag ... or just, SOMETHING
help 2018-11-16 01:33:25 I think it's long overdue, mainly considering how popular Plane Crazy is
help 2018-11-16 01:33:45 People can't moderate themselves anymore
help 2018-11-16 01:35:17 You royally fluffed your chances at being a mod Dragon, so sorry, but not a chance
creations-chat 2018-11-16 01:39:51 You need to detach stages with decouplers
help 2018-11-16 01:40:06 Tank was never blocked in the first place
help 2018-11-16 01:40:47 ... Dragon, that's very immature, and you know that right?
help 2018-11-16 01:43:47 Because he has an opinion that counters your opinion?
help 2018-11-16 01:49:51 How about 1 week to a month, but it varies depending on public and other mod opinions on him? Basically if he's this glowing symbol of glorious awesome, he only has to be Discord mod for 1 week before bumping into game mod, but if he's on the edge of being booted from being a mod, a month
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:33:24 ... Break it up and take it to <#495286269459300364> or <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:49:38 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:49:42 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:49:49 Cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:49:57 I don't care who started it, both of you, **END IT**
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:50:51 This is a Roblox Discord Turismo, what do you expect?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:51:09 Totten, when I say shut it, I mean SHUT IT!
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:51:24 Sorry but you to trollgeinuous
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:51:45 What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:52:36 Oh ouch, the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:53:25 Turismo, I'm going to stop you right there
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:53:36 This already falls under rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:53:42 Now quit it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:53:58 Trying to figure out what happened with Turismo now
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:54:10 It's controversial
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:54:23 You were the one that fucking joked about it in the first place, so you're one to talk
creations-chat 2018-11-16 02:56:04 If thatcat gets on here, he'll get the rank to
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:56:29 You can say that stuff trollgeinuous, but only if you use it sensibly, rather than swearing out every person
creations-chat 2018-11-16 02:56:57 Oh, didn't see him, whops
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:57:43 I'm not sure to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:58:12 Well that's the biggest lie ever
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:58:16 2 lies now
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 02:59:10 "Honestly I never think anything is funny"
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:00:19 If you think it's bullying, then quit painting the mother of all  bullseyes all over yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:00:48 "I never think anything is funny", after you joked about cancer
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:01:02 Then why did you joke about it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:02:20 He doesn't feel fine because people keep on making "mistake" jokes about him, and you didn't help with your "mistake" joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:03:02 Then you should start first
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:04:11 ... Totten, can you please stop speaking gibberish and start looking and considering what other people are typing, for a reason other than to antagonize them?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:04:42 Getting a headache from totten's nonsense?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:06:02 ... Totten, you don't own this server, so don't order us around
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:07:09 Uhhhh, okay, <#497142796961054721> please?

plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:13:28 ... Okay, do I need to mute you two again?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:13:44 And here you were trying to let it continue totten ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:13:51 Quit hopping the fence as soon as you see the tides change

plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:23:58 OY, TOTTEN, do you want a second freaking warning!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:24:17 Not even close
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:24:43 Rule 2, NSFW stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:24:47 I still remember it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:25:22 I just answered it totten ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:25:41 He didn't warn you right now
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:25:45 He was reading over your warnings
general 2018-11-16 03:28:30 Don't question it Flame
help 2018-11-16 03:29:27 You may use engines to make a ship move
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:30:41 This has gone off topic, but I swear this always happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:31:03 If you could please move it to <#497142796961054721> as this has gone off the Plane Crazy conversation
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:31:52 Both of you cut it out, you seem to only pay attention to eachother, so just drag it to DMs
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:33:01 Right, since nobody's hearing this __***EVERYONE THAT ISN'T TALKING ABOUT PLANE CRAZY STUFF PLEASE MOVE TO OFF TOPIC NOW***__
general 2018-11-16 03:33:36 For fuck's sake totten, just type it out all at once
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:37:41 Rule 5, no

plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:38:41 Also, Tim, you just pingged mad accidentally
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:38:59 Notice how that @ is blue?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:39:17 OHHHHH
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:39:22 Nice one Tim
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:40:08 ... How bout no totten
general 2018-11-16 03:40:36 As long as it follows the rules
general 2018-11-16 03:40:42 Aka: No inappropriate stuff
general 2018-11-16 03:41:02 If it's random images and you don't want a response, <#495286269459300364>
general 2018-11-16 03:41:09 But if you want opinions, ask the question while sending the image
general 2018-11-16 03:41:26 Example: "What do you think of this jet?"
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:42:40 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:45:00 Wait, seriously Tim?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:45:18 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:46:00 It's not NSFW totten, it's right on the edge, but it's not NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:54:44 Try looking for him
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 03:55:09 Look at his ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 04:03:08 Height limit?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 04:17:03 If a bird hit my superfighter, it'd probably have it's atoms broken down into their quarks
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 04:17:59 Turismo's gone due to chaos by the way, feel free to DM him though
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 04:20:44 Turismo left due to too much chaos
creations-chat 2018-11-16 04:24:42 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 06:24:15 What do you mean? Like ropes or 2 piston blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 06:25:40 Ah, nice

help 2018-11-16 06:51:27 Which rank?
help 2018-11-16 06:52:19 For the love of, gamer, we agreed it wasn't replicator-worthy due to it's oversimplicity and inability to function anything more than just as a car
help 2018-11-16 06:53:32 Your own vote doesn't count mind you
help 2018-11-16 06:53:47 Who the hell is happy?
help 2018-11-16 06:54:13 ... A freaking alt I'd imagine
help 2018-11-16 06:54:51 4-5 in a row and it's considered spamming
help 2018-11-16 06:54:58 Happy is no longer in this server
help 2018-11-16 06:55:20 So I'm gonna knock off his vote, since he's no longer able to alter his vote, seems fair?
help 2018-11-16 06:55:34 Plus he has the vanilla Discord icon
bug-reports 2018-11-16 06:56:35 Seems like the other way around, my MK2 gets even faster in the arena
help 2018-11-16 06:56:58 gamer, put some freaking effort into your creations, we've all agreed that it's not replicator-worthy
help 2018-11-16 06:57:39 ... You really are freaking blunt about it aren't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 06:57:59 Nice, I can see it's got enough space
help 2018-11-16 06:58:31 Gamer, make it do a kickflip and land said kickflip
help 2018-11-16 06:58:59 It's a box on wheels ...
help 2018-11-16 06:59:16 There's a reason we downvote that stuff, and there's a reason totten keeps on getting nuke with his creations, it's a god damn box on wheels
help 2018-11-16 06:59:24 Er, admittedly that is a bit dictatorial Empire
help 2018-11-16 07:00:21 GAMER, "but i did it" doesn't count, it DIDN'T is the thing
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:00:46 Are you kidding me? It looks good compared with mine

help 2018-11-16 07:01:00 Let me put it this way
help 2018-11-16 07:01:08 Learn to **SPELL** out stuff, before trying to convince us
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:01:27 My first one was literally a flying box with the bottom cut off
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:01:33 Er, top, not bottom
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:01:36 I still have it for nostalga
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:02:15 Ah
help 2018-11-16 07:02:35 Right, let me put the be-all end-all argument for this
help 2018-11-16 07:02:42 There's nothing that defines it as a skateboard, at all
help 2018-11-16 07:03:29 It's not a skateboard, it can't do anything a skateboard can, it doesn't look anything like a skateboard, and it's absolutely abhorrently ugly
help 2018-11-16 07:03:48 Your OWN upvote gamer, which we don't count, and I already booted your alternate account
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:04:31 Most combat-effective fighter?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:05:06 I meant combat-effective
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:05:14 Like, able to take the most damage, maneuver the fastest, etc
help 2018-11-16 07:05:31 You wanna see what makes a good replicator rank?

help 2018-11-16 07:06:46 THIS
help 2018-11-16 07:06:51 THIS IS WHAT MAKES A GOOD REPLICATOR RANK
help 2018-11-16 07:06:57 Credit to Imperial
help 2018-11-16 07:07:26 OHF- oh yeaaaahhhh, I nearly forgot
help 2018-11-16 07:07:39 Well, congrats geinuous
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:07:52 It's pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:08:06 I tend to play in third person, hence why my cockpit's solid
help 2018-11-16 07:08:27 ...
help 2018-11-16 07:08:40 It's literally a flying box, even moreso than Totten's, which I thought was literally impossible
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:01 I could refit my fighter to use glass rather than solid blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:11 gamer, my planes float like nobody's business, seriously
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:34 I TRIED sinking the MK2 with it's reverse thrust, that thing just floats right back up
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:09:58 It's really bulky, and obvious, I like it
help 2018-11-16 07:10:06 Not really
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:10:55 Gonna resurface my two prized planes, the MK2 fighter and the superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:00 
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:04 
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:25 It's fine
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:28 Also, what do you think?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:11:39 Both, the MK2 and superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:12:13 The MK2's for performance, hence lack of paint, I also retrofitted it with rocket engines rather than jet engines
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:12:32 The superfighter's moreso for looks, but it's got so many pieces that even if you nuke it it'll remain intact
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:12:46 Boats are really easy
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:13:00 Bump the wings further forwards?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:13:32 Just add a note "Boats tend to be easy, you just need to have enough of a surface area"
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:13:42 Plane's difficult, sub's difficult, VTOL, freaking hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:14:11 Dude, a guy dropped a freaking carrier onto my superfighter, that thing floated
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:15:15 Oh, you mean giant cars
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:16:16 He means custom wheels
creations-chat 2018-11-16 07:26:39 Hey, that means you're doing well
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 07:44:36 Dragon and Totten I get, they downvote anything that isn't theirs, others? Dunno
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:11:14 It's him Imperial, if anything it's more legitimate because it's obstructed by a semi-transparent thing, primarily because you'd have to copy the letters from somewhere else if you're going that far to get ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:12:06 Like, it's obstructed, but if you look closely you can see the name through the effects
creations-chat 2018-11-16 14:46:45 Try making it arena-cappable, aka: Guns and/or missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 14:48:30 You're spamming up the chat, which isn't convincing us to take action upon it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 14:48:38 And before you ask, I'm really busy
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 14:50:03 I FUCKING SAID I'M REALLY BUSY, **NOW CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO CONSIDER OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES** __**INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN NEEDS LIKE WE'RE YOUR SERVANTS OR SOMETHING!?**__
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:08:24 I mean, (sorry if I'm pushing this one quite a bit, but) the MK2's probably even better at that (except on the top and bottom, there it's a huge target)
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:08:42 Of course that's the old jets only variant, back when the arena only accepted old blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:09:18 But still, I literally had the thing take about 80% damage recently and it still flew, infact, it not only flew, it was able to fight back pretty fiercely still
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:10:57 Tops out at 450 with the new engines, but it's also able to turn 90 degrees within it's length, basically if you took the length of the MK2 and put a plane 1 (maybe 2 for safety's sake) lengths away from it, it'd be able to turn out of the way in time
creations-chat 2018-11-16 15:11:08 And yes it's one of my most favorite builds of all time because it handles like a dream
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:30:26 That's a value overload it seems, aka: It's when it can no longer register how many digits you put in
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:31:06 Similar to how on a TI-84 calculator, numbers can go up to E+99, but literally one extra digit, no matter how tiny, makes it register as infinity
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 15:31:26 Also, let's see Deception?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:11:57 It's a scam, give him a blank account and cut ties with him
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:12:16 And ask "Money first, account second"
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:13:51 Explain: "If I give you the info, you'll just take it without giving me money, so give me part of the money first, and I'll give you part of the account", and link to a blank account with an image on the icon
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:09 Make sure it's not new by the way, otherwise they'll figure it out by looking at the profile
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:18 And don't give your main account
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:26 Wait, no, bad idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:31 It's got your E-mail and such linked to it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:39 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:14:45 Did you catch the ID of who it was?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 16:15:14 A scammer, obviously
creations-chat 2018-11-16 17:27:05 If you take everyone's ability to catch the ranks, and mix it all together, you'll get all the ranks
general 2018-11-16 17:44:20 So that's how people come up with those absolutely fake "infinite robux" pictures that fool idiots, good to know
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:46:06 Tag them
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:46:12 Find their username and ID and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:46:16 Like, specifics
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:46:26 Not just "Soul", but like "Soul#(Number)"
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:48:18 Anyone got any empty or throwaway accounts that have been collecting cobwebs for a few years?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:48:57 The plan I've got is scamming the scamer, hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:50:18 TLDR, that person's trying to scam people out of Discord servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:50:34 Asking for massive server ownerships or for accounts
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:50:40 Too Long Don't Read, basically a summary
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:53:14 That's, a FUCKING HORRIBLE IDEA, no offense
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:53:41 He'll just screw around with your profile settings before you change the password, and it won't boot him if you change it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:53:52 And by the time you change it again, he'll change the E-mail and counter-change it
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:54:24 And loose everything?
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:54:37 Plus they aren't stupid, there's a reason they're not busted yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 17:55:33 New discord accounts have a little thing, it's called a "Wumpus", you see it in the friends tab alot, that thing pokes up to tell people if you're new to Discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:00:44 Expect Soul to have action taken against them, probably legal action as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:01:15 I don't think alot of people know how to type down a Discord report, so I decided to google it and go through the process of typing one out
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:01:23 The scammer Empire
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:02:11 With luck they'll be banned for good, and with better luck they may even get arrested or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 18:02:25 Worst comes to worst I just put a bit of time off, oh well
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:49:09 I wanna make a squadron of varying fighters, seriously
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:49:20 Yes I know that's a bad idea in actual practice, but still
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:04 If it's durable, able to maneuver quickly and can load alot of firepower while being fast, I guess so fonkl
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:09 Also, hey, we have another Imperial in the server
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:50:24 Also if I had to guess I'd say that that fighter's about 200-300 parts?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 18:51:23 Hey, I'm pretty good at guessing how many parts there are
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 22:13:47 I'd say you can use a translator so long as you put what you input in and what translator it is
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:41:36 Want critique on it?
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:42:09 Like, ways that you could improve on future builds later
creations-chat 2018-11-16 22:42:19 It will be a bit, hurtful, fair warning
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:11:28 Wait, it got removed?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:11:42 Huh, glitch?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:11:58 Show me what got inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:12:24 ... Uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:12:37 That, wouldn't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:12:42 What did you build that got you inventor?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:20 Totten, answer me seriously, what the fuck did you build that got inventor? A freaking tin can won't get you inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:13:59 Well maybe the glitch was the other way around then, you got inventor accidentally
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:15:12 Oh for f- fine, we did remove your rank due to the fact that we deemed your submission inadequate for inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:15:35 I'm not even sure about that Xpert?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:18:36 Totten, did you not read what I typed out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:19:12 TLDR Totten, we all examined your various creations and decided your "inventor" piece wasn't really inventor-worthy
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:19:22 And not just one tiny piece, all of them
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:19:27 Too Long Don't Read, aka: Summary
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:20:21 A cylindrical vehicle with a square top
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:20:26 With the game's aerodynamics it would Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:20:34 Real life aerodynamics, even then you can force it
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:20:37 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:20:50 Don't bother, this is someone who's so block-headed that he doesn't listen to anyone except himself
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:21:56 He didn't warn him, he's reminding totten of his warnings
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:22:18 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:22:22 Even I remember it and I wasn't even involved
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:23:19 He's asking who won the naval contest
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:23:58 Guys, er, a little thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:24:06 I actually sorta brought down the hammer on the conversation
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:24:18 "Don't bother, this is someone who's so block-headed that he doesn't listen to anyone except himself"
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:25:31 Totten, prove me wrong then, it's not being rude if it's so blindingly correct that everyone with eyes should notice, but also that one person's incorrect
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:26:01 "Contributes a bit", as you try to spam the same thing over and over again
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:26:55 May I direct you to this?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:27:19 NOW tell me that's not spamming, I literally had to tell you to shut it because you kept on asking if someone was online
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:27:47 Oy, I'll have at ya Kratos, my MK2 and superfighter will beat you down (Not actually trying to be rude by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:28:14 Actually, on a serious note Kratos, think we could make the first interstellar fleet?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:28:38 Doesn't work like that Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:29:07 Don't try to be nice after you throw shit in my face ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:29:15 You've done that like 50 times already, infact, not just to me either
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:29:43 "Don't try to be nice after __**YOU THROW SHIT IN MY FACE**__"
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:29:53 Note: __***AFTER***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:30:16 You aren't forgetful at all, you hold grudges until the world pops, end of story
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:06 Okay you know what, end it, now, no more mentions of your ex-inventor rank, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:29 Ehhh, <@205404956759556096> , I build single seaters, dual seaters at most, not multi-crew ships
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:32:45 I built scifi fighters, he built scifi capital ships
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:51:43 A unique mechanism means an ability that we haven't seen before
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:52:19 I'll reference Ignacioel's modular vehicle again, because it's actually a very good example, many people built cars, nobody built one that has pre-built parts, that you can attach and reattach, mix and match
creations-chat 2018-11-17 00:52:44 With a dive like that, no amount of bracing will save ya
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:53:42 I'm not explaining why it isn't dumb because you wouldn't understand it, and it'd just start another fight
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:54:43 Totten, the answer, unless you build a new mechanism, is a solid __***NO***__, got it?

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:57:41 AND THESE ARE ALL TAKEN MIND YOU
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:57:54 Modular vehicle builder, you use the crane during flight mode to lift parts onto the vehicle rig
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:58:09 Blame Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:58:14 All credit goes to him
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 00:58:57 THAT is why I praise him so much by the way, he's as inventive as hell, with such a huge dose of creativity that it's, admittedly drowning others out
bug-reports 2018-11-17 00:59:09 We know, Rick's fixing that
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:01:59 Not even close Collin, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:02:13 New mechanism, not vehicle, although that might be modeler-worthy
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:02:40 I feel like the odd one out, but I built a flipper, like a Robot Wars style flipper
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:03:14 Ejector seat's already made
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:03:28 Just wanted to show it off?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:04:13 Wait, so you can eject your wings Fanta?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:06:39 I made the MK1 have an ejectable wing, the entire left side could burst off
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:06:57 And this was to test it's theoretical durability
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:07:06 It, was, astonishingly durable
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:07:32 Like an actual V-12 piston engine?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:07:40 Pffff, I would pay to see that
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:07:48 With actual combustion inside being replicated somehow?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:08:39 I wish collisions worked better
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:08:41 Actually
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:11:57 It works per click, so autoclicker
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:19:58 Anything engineless is a nogo for me
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 01:22:31 My guns are designed to rip through solid creations because they're focused as hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 04:36:42 ?
creations-chat 2018-11-17 04:52:39 Hey, V-wing deisgn, nice, also do I see motors on the rear wings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:36:35 Don't worry, fuel was added in the long past and people didn't like it due to limited flight
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:38:44 Ball wheels act like wheels that point in every direction simultaneously
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:39:35 Ball wheels aren't powered
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:45:35 It allows for loose "projectile" style blocks to be chambered in
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:46:43 A surface tool would be incredibly difficult with how the scripting of Plane Crazy works
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:48:31 Why not find out yourself flying?
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:48:43 Roblox's acting weird Rick, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:49:30 I wonder if Mad might consider some form of monetization, nothing serious, just a tip jar maybe
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:30 It's ever so slightly smaller, at least from what I know/hear
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:51:50 Fanta, you can see the tiny gap
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 20:52:33 Check <#507673335816126509>
creations-chat 2018-11-17 21:24:11 Ignacioel, ultimate swing-wing fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-17 21:24:40 You know what swing wings are, right?

plane-crazy 2018-11-17 21:34:11 Drag it into Plane Crazy and we'll be impressed
bug-reports 2018-11-17 22:06:23 It's been there, most of us have built around it by this point
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:26:20 Muted him as a patch, anyone able to ban him?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:27:07 Wait, do an @ but don't press enter
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:27:17 Look at the name that pops up
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:27:24 madattak#4662
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:27:50 Ohhhhh I'm going to do more than ban him, remember the last fool that bothered us?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:28:06 The scammer, Soul?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:28:35 Let's see what I can do
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:33:23 He's dipping in and out to evade the ban
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:34:29 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:34:44 His only connection's you Deception, he's following you
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:34:53 Correction, he's on the friends list with you
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:35:15 
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:36:05 Actually, hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 00:36:10 That's a good point, discussion time
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 01:27:29 Doubt it
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 01:29:38 Well, so long as they don't interact with other people or bother them, I don't care if someone hacks an Eiffel tower into the game
creations-chat 2018-11-18 02:48:04 Nice, looks pretty nimble
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:48:38 ... Hawkinq
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:48:46 What, the actual fuck, did I talk to you about?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:48:58 Enough, I'm not shielding you anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:49:16 Gonna erase it before more controversy
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:49:34 Now then, Hawkinq, we've all had enough of your inappropriate crap
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:49:57 Empire, I already talked to him/her about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:50:05 That in it of it's own right should've been a warning
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:50:14 Yet me, being nice, decided not to add one
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:51:09 ?warns iiHawkinq
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:51:11 ... What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:51:17 There we go
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:58:14 Your carrier's actually really stubby Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:58:21 If anything it's too short
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:58:37 The one that you showed us that's "too long"

plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:58:56 This one
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:59:06 Wait, then who's?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:59:10 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:59:25 Tell him everyone's agreeing that his is too stubby
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:59:26 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:00:16 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:00:27 Like, genuinely change it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:00:34 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:00:46 Well, ask someone trustworthy to screw around with your creation and see if it breaks it
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:01:02 Then ask if you could do the same and see if it takes effect
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 03:28:12 That would be horrible Deception
creations-chat 2018-11-18 21:30:15 Tilts which direction?
creations-chat 2018-11-18 22:52:08 Welp, GG, Santa Sleigh, nice job
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:07:05 You're trying to make a U-wing aren't you?
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:07:54 Auto controls are assigned as soon as you spawn in, meaning that you have to build it with the wings folded out in order for it to work, and even then it'll act weirdly
bug-reports 2018-11-19 03:08:07 They don't automatically update as you move your wings
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:22:36 Pretty decent for a first plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:26:52 There we go
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:27:21 Right, now that the chat's cleaned up, can you cut it with the "funny" stuff?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:27:28 Everything you think is "funny" is really annoying to us
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:28:24 Now shut it, I'm muting you for your own protection, since you're so insistent on self harm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:28:50 You just want to paint yourself in the worst possible picture relative to the rest of us, and nobody wants that
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:29:13 If anything, we HATE using our powers to boot people, yet when push comes to shove, we will do it if things get taken too far
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:29:32 Now cut it out, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:30:19 Complete sentences if you'd please, that way you don't flood the chat so I have to re-prune it again
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:31:23 Much better
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:31:39 ... Correction, not better
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:32:05 I already erased it ... and what happened to complete sentences?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:32:18 Oh god what are you planning Ignacioel?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:32:34 Pfff, god damn it Flame! Baahhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:32:49 I'm lighthearted to that
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:33:29 Just scrap it for the love of god
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:34:26 You, harassing and bothering a server, calling the cops on us?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:34:46 Welp, uhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:34:48 Huuuhhhh
general 2018-11-19 04:35:44 I try to not use it and talk to people instead
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:35:55 That's actually accurate
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:36:19 WAIT ARE YOU S- Ignacioel, quit trying to make inventor like 90 times over, we only have a finite amount of metal to make our trophies out of
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:39:20 Now make it drop out of a plane or heli or something
creations-chat 2018-11-19 04:40:27 I'm pretty sure you're so good that every movement you make is inadvertedly flexing on the rest of us
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 04:40:50 To prove how much crap we've had with him
general 2018-11-19 04:52:32 There's notifications that direct you straight to rules when you first join
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:37:58 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:38:32 Ouch, RIP Collin
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:40:13 I'm pretty sure they'd be hard-pressed to copy it
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:40:38 Anything above 100 blocks is probably hard to copy
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:46:12 Not bad
creations-chat 2018-11-19 05:48:26 PFFFFF, well done, round of applause for you
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:51:07 Explain the issues?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:52:28 Center of Lift's too far back, that's the blue orb
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:52:38 Kick it forwards with more wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:52:59 That's the issue
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:53:04 Your center of lift is lifting your rear up
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:53:16 And that's driving your nose into the ground, which results in a downwards pitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:53:33 Think of it like a seesaw, you apply force to one end, the other end goes down
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:54:10 Ogami, trust me, your center of lift's too far back, hence why you keep on diving
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:54:40 But now it's diving into the ground when you let go of the controls?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:55:12 Again, Ogami, it's because your center of lift is too far back
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:56:02 You want ballasts to shift the weigeht
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:56:11 Anchors just stop you mid-air
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:57:02 WS for pitch, AD for yaw (left and right), QE for roll, that's my setup for most of my aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:59:06 Ehhhh, just experiment Ogami
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:59:13 Also, Royal, I have a QWERTY keyboard
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:59:29 Your thrust controls are fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 05:59:34 Actually, freaking hell, they mimic me
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:00:04 Ah, you can let landing gear go automatically
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:00:14 It auto-assigns controls based on what'd allow for the best rotations
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:00:19 Don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:00:30 Basically, steering and auto controls, leave them on, they'll help you turn
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:02:05 You can just leave it Ogami
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:02:08 It'll auto-assign
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:05:34 Oy, oy oy oy oy oy, Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:05:38 None of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:05:48 Too late
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:06:15 Deception, could you try to control yourself a bit? You're starting to get, unstable
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:06:23 Another server
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:08:19 It might automatically tilt if you've auto-assigned control surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:08:27 That slight clockwise/counter-clockwise tilt is your roll
general 2018-11-19 06:19:28 BOTH OF YOU CUT IT OUT!
general 2018-11-19 06:19:41 Putting a hard stop on this before it gets out of hand
general 2018-11-19 06:20:00 And keep that stuff in DMs, read <#512414682552729601> please
general 2018-11-19 06:20:45 I don't care about whatever you two do in DMs to eachother and eachother only, so long as neither side complains about it, and none of it leaks out here
general 2018-11-19 06:21:48 Next one's a warning, got it? We can't risk that kind of stuff, lest this server be taken down
general 2018-11-19 06:22:48 TLDR I'm keeping people safe from themselves, they nearly broke rule 2, and I would've had to whack them to the moon
general 2018-11-19 06:23:30 I've been bothered by people for being too brutal, so
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:24:15 Lansink, you can still make the U-wing, you just need the wings to start open then
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:24:24 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:24:33 Nose to ground?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:24:51 Wait, wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:24:56 Did you build it in reverse!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:04 They affect people in the arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:17 Ogami, auto-controls assign assuming you're pointing forwards!
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:23 No wonder you had so many issues!
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:28 Yeah, RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:52 Suggestion: Use the move tool to move it off to one side, then rebuild it so it's facing forwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:25:54 Move the seat last
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:26:13 Hard to implement
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:26:27 Good luck
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:26:53 Probably not
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:26:55 Dogfighting birds?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:27:16 You can manually assign ALL controls, but other than that, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:27:35 There's a little knobby thing in between G, H and B on some keyboards Collin
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:27:42 Team build isn't enabled yet Ogami, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:28:06 You want pitch on the inner wings, roll on the outer wings, and yaw on the tail
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:28:18 That's all I can say, everything else is personal preference
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:28:39 Then make one up
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:28:52 It's up to you in the end Ogami
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:29:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:29:28 I mean, someone built a plane to the side
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:29:48 Experiment a bit Ogami
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:29:59 The best way to find what's comfortable is experimenting
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:30:09 Just remember, roll on the outer wing, pitch on the inner wing, and yaw on the tail wing
general 2018-11-19 06:30:44 Nice, you made a cross firework, now make a dragon head firework (Don't, it's near impossible to make uneven shapes like that)
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:30:57 It's a keyboard/OS issue
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:31:08 Press C a few times
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:31:15 You need to turn off auto for the gears
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:31:19 As again, they're assigned in reverse
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:31:25 I believe so
bug-reports 2018-11-19 06:31:35 The most I've used is 4, and that was in the past
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:31:54 In flight mode, you can change your camera
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:32:43 '?warn
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:33:01 '""?warn DeceptionTime1
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:33:39 Don't worry, we're just kidding Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:34:56 Nose pitching down constantly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:35:30 Turn the outer-most two control surfaces on your wings to roll
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:35:35 Or, however many
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:35:40 You want half for pitch, half for roll per wing
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:35:48 And you want the tail fin/wing to go for yaw
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:39:30 Yeah, because you built it in reverse, still, you've done good to fix it, so far
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:41:04 Well hey, at least if I'm scary I keep trolls from bothering people, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:46:47 From <#491710474786832394> , no
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:46:56 At least, there's no part that paints other vehicles, yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:47:03 That'd be a good idea though, but it'd have to work on your own vehicles only
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:47:30 So basically sorta like paint bombs?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:47:34 Not yet poke
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:47:45 You can paint whole wedges, but not individual surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:48:03 We have bombs, they're called rockets pointed downwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:48:28 Which would probably kill the game in seconds
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:48:53 I'm not sure why that isn't implemented Poke, probably difficulty rescripting?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:03 Rockets were originally homing, but it didn't really end well
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:11 Yeah, there' difficulty in that, and that's that they're one-off blocks poke
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:36 Issue Empire is that they don't carry momentum, so they just drop immediately
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:42 Which is either very easy to aim or very hard to aim
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:49:51 Against air vehicles they suck
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:50:12 Like trust me, I haven't been hit by a rocket yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:50:47 That'd be one-off though, which, considering how long arena lasts, isn't that good
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:51:22 Considering what's on the front page Imperial, I wish I could deny that, but sadly it's too true
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:51:53 Seems like everyone's excited, anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:09 Basically toxic roleplay places tend to float around Roblox's front page
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:17 So, we'd net a ton of people
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:34 Yeah, we'd get too many suicide jokes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:52:44 So no thanks to explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:53:07 Heh, we were too active, RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:53:51 Again Imperial, people would abuse it to make suicide jokes, which would make people uncomfortable
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:54:24 Let's not bring that up
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:54:29 And nah Imperial, it's good that people are chatting
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:54:32 Even if chaotic
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:55:35 Okay let's not go that far Yappy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:55:39 That's a bit too far
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:55:58 Still no
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:56:01 Sorry about that
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:56:08 Nah
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:56:18 It's naivety, he doesn't really know
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:57:28 Right, I'm off, seeya guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:57:35 I'll need a target to do that poke
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:57:47 And that target will probably have to be content being shot down alot
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:58:23 Ehhhh, you know how hard it is for people to take me down, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:58:39 This thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:07 It's the MK2
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:27 Basically I designed tha thing for peak performance
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:30 And of course it works yappy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:37 It's actually very durable
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:44 Like, you can literally rip half of it off and it can still fly
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 06:59:57 My first and only 1000+ block creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:00:12 Ah, not even close Empire, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:00:20 Never understood how to fold
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:00:28 It's the same as yours yappy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:00:40 Hence why the superfighter's not designed for combat Farollo
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:00:56 We got a bit too excited and started chatting too much Royal
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:01:23 I feel like my superfighter, if it got in the arena, would be almost stupidly durable
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:01:32 Hey, that's better than my second
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:01:50 Why so many A-10s!?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:01:57 This is like the 90th A-10 I saw
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:02:08 Show a block count yappy? Like, the save slot
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:02:23 Show a picture, that's the only way we get 100% proof
creations-chat 2018-11-19 07:02:36 I'd imagine because it's stupidly reliable
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:03:14 Did not end well?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:04:20 That tends to be what happens with all aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:04:26 My suggestion: Use alot of internals
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:04:30 That's what I did with my superfighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:04:39 It also makes it really hard to copy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:04:57 The MK2?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:05:01 It's for function, not fashion
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:05:36 Yeah, that's known Royal, to be fixed
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:06:13 2:06 AM, and I have possible classes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:06:21 But meh, __possible__ classes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:06:37 Farollo, wanna try mine out?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:06:42 No autoclickers by the way, those are cheaty
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:07:35 Oy, Farollo, I wanna be the first
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:07:45 Do you want a solid spaceship or a motor spaceship?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:07:51 RIP Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:08:00 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:08:58 Good luck with that Yappy, large and fast don't mix in Plane Crazy

plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:09:20 Also, something like this Yappy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 07:11:43 Right, I'm off, seeya guys, really tired here
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 16:51:06 What kind of vehicle/building is it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 16:52:00 Maintenance, dining, residential
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:45:35 Super rockets are pretty much THE answer if you need velocity, they're the strongest type of engine available outside of warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 17:45:45 And warp drives are too big for that type of plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:17:09 Make a new mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:17:34 Already been done Royal, people made custom wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:17:46 Not even close, unless it's got a new mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:18:15 Dude, no, new MECHANISM
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:19:41 I think someone invented a clock already
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:19:44 Not 100% sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:19:47 Willing to bet that though
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:20:46 Not, even, close, in the slightest
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:20:58 Aka: __***NO***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:21:12 That's how un-inventorworthy it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:21:15 Just, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:21:32 Don't do a totten, for the love of god, it's not inventor-worthy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:21:58 Nah
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:23:20 They have, they've made every single fucking thing fused together, SOMEONE MADE A TOILET PLANE FOR GOD'S SAKE
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:23:34 You aren't winning based on something like that

plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:25:16 Credit to Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:25:28 Modular car, that's a new mechanic
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:25:38 Mobilized and functional arms, that's a new mechanic
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:25:58 So, vangoor, those are examples of inventor mechanics, things you've NEVER seen before that have some unique function that no other block can do
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:26:12 And all-everything vehicles don't count since it's too easy to make those
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:26:15 Got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:26:31 That's because these were ALREADY made
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:26:45 Manual, I believe so Farollo
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:26:47 Automatic, hell no
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:27:07 If you can make an auto-gyroscope that spins on it's own when it detects instabilities, no keypresses needed, that'll be impressive
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:27:27 Vangoor, soapbox cars?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:27:32 Someone tried that already
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:27:39 They got shot down with the force of the Starkiller base
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 18:27:45 MECHANISM, not creation
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:08:22 Propeller blades, not engines
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:08:47 I meant the 4 propeller engines you're using for a VTOL style movement
help 2018-11-19 20:10:03 Ballasts are your best bet
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:11:49 Any helium?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:25 Done, don't break my trust or I'll break you, got it? (FYI I'm in a bad mood, so expect me to be a bit, pissy)
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:31 Show the part count
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:34 Ballasts act as heavier blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:12:58 Also, quite literally if anything can fly, it's considered for the part ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:13:10 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:13:43 Done for van
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:14:10 You already have master builder
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:14:13 Next is 2K+
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:14:37 There's a way to glitch ballast blocks to be as heavy as ballast beams, but max weight ballasts are your best bet
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:15:38 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:01 Block count?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:12 RIP prop master Flame, sorry, but that's the rank's rules
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:28 Balance it without helium and you'll get it again
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:16:47 I mean, it's a start
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:19:53 Corner wedges merge well with other wedges
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:21:00 It's a Roblox physics thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:21:04 Ignore it
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:26:10 Yeup, that actually reminds me, hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:31:05 Don't ask, just do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:31:13 Think of something absurdly wild
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:31:23 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:31:58 Anyways, most of us that have inventor got it by thinking of the craziest or most complex mechanical creation we could think of, then trying to make it work
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:32:55 He didn't get it
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:33:00 You can see he didn't get the specific rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 20:33:48 Nope
creations-chat 2018-11-19 20:52:35 Want any ranks, or nah?
help 2018-11-19 21:10:42 He's just trying to be obnoxious, I mean look, he has inventor, so he must've gotten it from somewhere
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 21:30:26 Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 21:30:50 Nothing much, also that's what you call a warp drive Blox
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 21:31:56 Ask permission before smashing your craft into them
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 21:34:35 It's obnoxious otherwise
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:08:48 Show me your build?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:13 I meant on the whole craft
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:15 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:19 I see the issue immediately
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:26 Too much lift in the rear, not enough in the front
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:30 Also, A-wing?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:46 Yeah, sadly Plane Crazy's physics detest fighters like that
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:55 Also, save and reload the creation, you'll get the center of lift back
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:09:59 You'll find it's WAY in the rear
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:17 Aerodynamics work as if they're isolated from everything else, AKA: They work no matter what
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:21 Aso that looks pretty good Supreme
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:11:30 And how the heck is that a spitfire radoor?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:12:13 Ignore Dragon, he's been mad ever since we've shot a terrible idea of his down
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:12:55 Sadly that can't happen, again, hard coded, the game was never meant to be updated
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:15:30 Position and number of wing panels matter
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:15:43 You typed 136, his is 139
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:05 Best suggestion: Try it out
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:18 Remember, a center of lift in your rear will make you nosedive alot
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:29 So you want to try to get your center of lift near the actual center
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:33 If it's not appearing, save and try rejoining
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:16:49 Is, that a freaking mech?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:03 ._. Well then Kavteh
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:18 Also that's not really a spitfire, it's more like your own design
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:17:49 Ballasts are slightly broken, you have to eyeball it
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:06 Nice job
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:18 Also, I'd suggest using super rockets rather than regular rockets, super rockets are stronger and smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:18:34 The main pro is aesthetics, which, let's be honest, that looks WAY more awesome, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:19:30 Dragon, does it seem like I care about what you type out? You hate upon everything except your own creations and what Totten makes
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:19:49 Right, **WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?**
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:20:41 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:20:55 I think we might be pushing Rick a bit, let him take a break
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:21:11 Yeup
bug-reports 2018-11-19 22:28:59 If you need a break rick, feel free to take one
bug-reports 2018-11-19 22:31:30 Rick's going to fix it soon, just hold on for a bit
help 2018-11-19 22:34:50 Camera blocks act like another first person viewpoint
help 2018-11-19 22:35:04 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:41:57 Rick made the update, Mad added it into the actual game
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:42:16 We know the pyramid doesn't work
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:43:42 Try that again, we dare you
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:44:54 ?warnings <@!314219571995344897>
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:45:00 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:45:51 I'm temporarily muting BOTH OF YOU until you both **CAN IT**
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:46:12 They're both muted
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:46:46 Right, TLDR Blue, Dragon was saying alot of racial slurs, and Teal was trying to spam out inappropriate crap, alongside bypassing Rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:49:06 You got muted for racial slurs Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:49:56 Was Totten spamming his creation again?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:50:34 Correction, spamming, update it to it's final result and post that
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:50:42 Then say it's a quote next time Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:50:46 And put it in quotation marks
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:50:56 Example: "DragonMage: "IM QUOTING NINJA""
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:51:35 Because it's blocked now
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:51:38 Don't bypass the system
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:51:48 It's BLOCKED
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:52:45 Sorry for the chaos devuio
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:53:19 Right, can all of you __**PLEASE CALM DOWN FOR A MOMENT!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:53:37 Do you see how many chat messages are running by?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:53:43 That's not "calm"
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:53:57 Also can you quit trying to be a victim while simultaneously trying to pick on me Dragon? I'm growing really sick of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:54:45 Dragon, you were already told NOT to bypass it
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:54:57 Quote or not, NOT to bypass it, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:55:03 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:55:20 It is Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:55:33 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:55:54 I'm enabling mass slowmode, 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:56:02 Drax is Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:56:14 I'm sorry for those that wish to continue chatting, but this has gotten too chaotic
general 2018-11-19 22:56:35 Ask Rick and Mad, but don't ping them, they're usually very busy
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:56:58 Dragon, that word is a racial slur, now get over it, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:57:06 It's slowmode 30 currently ted
general 2018-11-19 22:57:18 It wasn't me that did it
general 2018-11-19 22:57:30 I don't have to answer who
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 22:57:39 Cranking it down to 5
creations-chat 2018-11-19 22:57:59 Nice one
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:01:43 None of us say racial slurs Totten ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:02:32 That's it, I'M CANNING BOTH OF YOU WITH A MUTE, the other mods can debate it between eachother whether to be nice or to leave you two on ice for a while until you both calm down and realize your mistakes, GOT IT!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:02:53 We don't appreciate bypassing the system, nor do we appreciate excessively going after the mods
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:03:22 Now leave us alone, place the blame on me sure, but leave the others be, and don't harass us
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:03:25 Not you geinuous
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:04:06 Sadly submissions are over
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 23:04:09 Sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:41:44 Okay that was a bit too far!
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:41:46 Whops
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:43:45 Excuse me while I break the troll's fucking face, alongside their computers and other various accounts
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:43:51 Because some people just deserve it
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:45:29 AHEM
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:46:21 Sooner or later I'm going to have to start handing out warnings like unwanted candy to little craps that can't control themselves ... Don't think I can't see what you typed, remember Rule 2
creations-chat 2018-11-20 00:46:29 I'll let you off for now, but do it again and see what happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:51:26 Not mine, Ignacioelpuro's, it's a modular vehicle

plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:51:38 This is what I will always cite whenever someone asks what makes a good inventor
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:52:11 He made a crane, been built before, and he made a mechanism that uses pre-built separated parts (Been done before), to place them on an empty frame, with the possibility of mix and matching parts, which hasn't been done before
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:52:53 It's a mechanism that's got some use or novelty that's not done by it's parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:53:17 I, sorta got mine back when it was a bit lenient, I made a flipper tank, basically a Robot Wars flipper bot, and since nobody had made it before, I got it
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:53:32 Just make a mechanism that nobody has seen before
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:54:15 As long as it's either useful or novel
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:54:21 Tilt rotors have been done before I believe
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:54:39 Infact, yeah, I saw a few tilt rotor mechanisms
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:01 That'd fall under the concept of maglev vehicles, which has been done before
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:25 ... Don't shit with me Flame, not in the mood
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:30 A-10's been done before
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:36 Many, many times infact
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:44 So many that it's actually boring
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:55:57 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:56:32 They're called warp drives
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:56:47 Here's an idea, a bolt action rifle that can manually load in new rounds
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:56:59 Well, we have a name for them, do you THINK they've been done already? (Answer: Yes)
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:57:34 But not one where you have to open the bolt and load the new round in
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:57:47 Done already
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:58:00 Actually, that'd be a bit too easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:58:21 A gun where there's a casing and a head, the head launches off, and the casing's ejected out, similar to a real bullet's mechanisms, and at least 1 new one can be loaded in
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:58:34 Manually, with some form of grabber, that doesn't have one attached to it already
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:58:44 Do all of that and you get inventor, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:59:12 I never said inventor was easy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 00:59:35 Because I got it early (And admittedly when it was more lenient)
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:00:02 As time passes, more people will come up with newer mechanisms with pre-existing parts, which means that even newer mechanisms have to be thought of
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:00:16 It's ambitious, I like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:01:16 Hello Yappy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:01:36 You didn't realize that in the first place?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:01:59 RIPasaurus Rex, coming through
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:03:12 Rocket scientist rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:03:34 Check <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:14:36 Quite literally a drone can be any vehicle in Plane Crazy, just make it truly unmanned or "unmanned"
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:16:41 Either it's packed inside the hull or you need to save and reload, if that doesn't work save and rejoin
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:17:33 ... Are you serious?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:17:38 You don't use blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:17:47 You use the freaking "wing" type entities
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:17:53 Including propeller blades
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:19:10 You can steer it, the only requirement is no helium
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:20:11 For the love of god, calm down
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:26:46 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:26:54 It's the quadcopter, except with 1 blade
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:29:46 I just explained it, it's the quadcopter, except with one middle rotor
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:30:07 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:30:26 Flip the blades the other way around
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:31:11 Sadly we can't, you probably overloaded the save slots
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:16:38 Right, Newdude, Deception, thatcat, all of you cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:16:50 Thatcat, folding is the technique of using motors in order to create joints in a creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:16:57 These joints are then closed to form a solid creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:17:12 You get it now?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:18:36 Thatcat, bigger plots are hardcoded, aka: They can not be changed
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:19:53 You want us to actually warn you then?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:20:18 Thought so, now quit acting absurdly rude to people that are trying to help you
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:20:46 It's a joke, even I could tell that
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:21:15 Anyways, what don't you get about folding? Seriously, many of the bigger creations are done via folding
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:21:36 It's not crazily difficult
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:23:02 Blue, it's called folding
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:26:18 ... Blue, you wouldn't happen to be an alt of thatcat's, would you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:26:58 If you seriously think we're bullying, then you're looking at it in reverse, thatcat is bothering us after we repeatedly try to explain to him what to do
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:28:06 We've had a bad case of alts in the past, so we can and will break you and every other account you can possibly field onto this server if you're an alt of a person who was kicked or otherwise punished for either breaking the rules or for generally being toxic
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:28:18 So you'd better play nice, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:28:50 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:29:22 It's creepy, not beautiful
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:30:00 If you want TRUE bullying, I'll happily show you what true bullying is, __**GOT IT!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:30:13 I'm just, not in a good mood recently
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:36:27 It happens because people are assholes that want complete and total anarchy in a vague attempt to better their own lives, not realizing that it winds up being worse for everyone involved, whether they're trying to dampen the damage or to cause the damage, they wind up either being screwed over, or screwing themselves over
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:37:19 Doesn't matter how deep of a hole you make for them, they'll just pretend they're floating over it to support their own thoughts
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:41:14 Excuse me totten? You're one to talk
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:42:19 ... Let me remind you
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:42:24 ?warnings <@!294956031153405952>
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:42:29 You're on your last strand
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:43:03 You want me to fish up the proof that you've attempted it Totten?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:44:06 Must be in an old server then
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:44:22 Deception, think of it as another first person point
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:44:44 Totten, then quit trying to piss me off to high hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:44:50 Also, that must be an old server thatcat
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:45:37 Free VIP servers for you to test crud in in <#501059272675688468> , the top one by vipEmpire tends to be the most active
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:48:57 Then don't spam
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:49:03 Which was what you were doing before
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:49:16 We can't go easy on it because the last time we went easy, it was abused to hell and back
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:50:26 TLDR, someone joined, trolled around all over the place, got warned many times, kicked, and eventually they had to be banned, but not before causing quite a few people to leave with their obnoxious trolling
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:51:02 About 5 times before the kick
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:51:23 We just didn't register the latter few because we tried to be nice and lenient
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:51:31 That did not work, and 3-4 people left
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:51:40 Join what exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:51:49 In what?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:52:21 Spoilers Deception, I'm probably the one person that doesn't own Minecraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:52:30 And I'm not in Plane Crazy that
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:52:52 Blue, if you say anything that breaks the rules I'm going to break your account, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:52:56 Fine, cat, whatever
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:53:12 Not you Cat, Bluemystic
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:53:43 .... Right, one at a time
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:54:12 First, Blue
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:54:18 This is cutting it somewhat close
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:54:22 Got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:54:33 Second, Cat, I said Bluemystic, not Cat
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:54:45 Third, Totten, that's rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:57:01 What is it with you and your obsession with me Totten? Half the conversations seem to be about me, and how I'm either good if I'm watching you and are pissed off, or bad if I try to do my sodding job
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:58:37 Do you mind complete sentences? The barf of tiny text is irritating, and it's filling up the chat faster than Niagra falls in a teacup
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 02:59:28 It's fine so long as you improve upon your mistakes
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:00:01 ... Totten, don't think you know how to adminstrate/moderate me
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:00:08 Also, RIP Paul
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:00:18 Oh ouch
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:01:13 Can you swap out the GPU Paul?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:01:55 Hello_camrock8
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:14:25 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:14:31 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:14:38 Dragon, you clearly haven't learned, have you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:10 You're trying to bypass it with a similar word, even though we know what you're saying
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:28 ?warnings <@!314219571995344897>
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:40 Knock out the one by Orange because me and him accidentally doubled up
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:46 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:53 Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:15:57 Me and Dragon accidentally doubled up at one point
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:16:00 So 3 warnings, not 4
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:16:22 Ehhh, I'm feeling nice, so a mute
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:16:55 NewDude, replace the a with an I, that's what he means
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:17:36 ... He's bugged me for too fucking long anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:19:14 Here's the reason: "Repeatedly, and consistently attempting to harass me and others in various ways via bypassing of some form, whether swapping out letters, adding spaces or just plain being blunt"
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:19:52 Now then, Dragon, do me, us, and yourself a favor, and leave us the actual fuck alone, we've had enough of your harassing shit
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:20:56 And don't assume we don't know what you mean by "nagger", you tried calling me "nagger" with an I instead of an A before, and it's even burned into the mod logs, so if you want me to resurface all of that and make you look like the shittiest "human" on Earth, then feel free to try me
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:22:21 Right, sorry 0v3r_z3r0, long story short Dragon's been obnoxious for a long time in the Discord, starting an argument as soon as he joined, which is still floating around in <#491710474786832394> , and completely blowing the chance I gave him to redeem himself
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:22:56 I literally let him micromod under my name for him to try to redeem himself, and he flukes it
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:25:19 For a summary of why Dragon got such a punishment, he kept on being obnoxious and annoying, bothering many, many people, and primarily targetting mods, further targetting me from what it seems, by attempting to repeatedly accuse me of "bullying" him, even if I don't even chat to, or about him
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:26:02 Tell him it's up to Xpert's decision on how long it is, we're all fed up to hell with his antics
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:26:20 And also tell him he's lucky I decided to be nice, if he caught me an hour earlier he would've just been banned
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 03:26:51 Thank you for this, apologies for the recent bit of chaos
help 2018-11-20 03:27:30 Did you check the controls?
help 2018-11-20 03:27:39 Manual or automatic?
help 2018-11-20 03:27:58 Does it have an inverse effect, or do they just not work?
help 2018-11-20 03:28:39 Odd, try saving and reloading the craft
help 2018-11-20 03:29:58 Remove a couple and re-add them, see if they have an effect afterwards
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:23 What do you mean? Like, how to make such a large creation in such a small space?
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:35 Also, Duuck, if you want to get a rank, you need to show the save slot
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:43 And Wyse, that's thanks to folding, in <#501034677793193994>
creations-chat 2018-11-20 03:30:59 For a summary of it, it's the art of making specific points where motors can bring the craft together
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:42:51 I think I saw someone make a swashplate before, although those are extremely rare, let me check
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:43:02 mxdanger made one
creations-chat 2018-11-20 12:43:09 Search up "swashplate" and you'll see
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 13:25:57 That's quite literally a Halo ship that's effectively just a ship built around a gun
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:01:26 DragonMage, you, me, DMs, now, I'm fucking sick of this
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:02:35 Nice one
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:03:02 Give him an axe
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:04:21 It's only weak because you've got no CIWS system
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:04:31 Add CIWS and bye bye missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:11:59 Bulky, I'm guessing a capital class ship?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:13:36 Try overriding non-used slots with empty plots
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:13:58 Example: One of my really old fighters no longer worked, so I had to scrap the thing entirely, so I deleted every slot that had that particular fighter in it
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:16:06 WELL THEN ._. good luck
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:16:18 That's, that's probably going to occupy all of your data
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:16:25 Will it be able to fly though?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:16:34 If not, still cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:16:42 Dragon, DMs ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:25:34 ... Ahem, <@!314219571995344897> , DMs, let's get this over with
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:56:13 Is that a challenge Furno?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:56:38 Quick question, do rockets home in? From the time I tested it, they don't seem to
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:07 Then don't claim "most manoeverable", because that tends to send out a challenge to those to build a more maneuverable craft
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:37 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-20 14:57:51 Nevermind, I'm blind, I blame lack of sleep
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 14:58:48 Gonna be out to get my life fixed and for food, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 15:40:08 Just mess around with the paint until you see something you like
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 16:36:22 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 16:49:57 Welp, "teamwork"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:08:27 Because I well and truly am completely and entirely out of patience with you
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:08:48 You want the rest of the context? I will drag the DMs over here so everyone can see how fucking delusional you are with trying to deny that you did anything wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:10:15 Forgive me for getting my hands dirty with the ni word in this picture, but

plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:04 A snippit of yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:11:30 Do I need to say more Dragon? Do I need to make you look even more delusional?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:18 At the top of the first picture I showed of our DMs
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:35 Do I need to say more?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:12:39 Also nice job vangoor
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:00 Dragon, you are as naive as you are denialistic and idiotic
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:12 Look at these 3 points
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:13:22 They completely overrule your statement
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:14:36 People say "neg" all the time in order to avoid saying "nig" and bypass filters ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:16:48 You meant it as "nig", you're just using that video as an excuse for a crutch
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:16:54 
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:17:02 Tada, proof that it was racist
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:17:15 Then you know what to say
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:17:52 If you truly didn't mean it, **YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY**, or are you still denialistic?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:18:21 Ceasing
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:20:25 Safety reasons, sorry Inferno
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:22:13 As long as it's not a racist thing, like "Gram cracker", rather than "YOU DAMN CRACKER", former is fine, latter isn't
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:22:58 If it's an inside joke with a friend, declare it as such, like "You're such a cracker! (Inside joke with [insert user here])"
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:23:37 Be a bit careful around that Inferno, there's a reason I whack-a-moled your previous comment
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:24:00 Okay that had a few that weren't allowed under any circumstances, even as inside-jokes
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:25:27 That one's fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:25:57 As long as people don't get offended by it and it doesn't break Rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:22 Ballasts are blocks that are heavier than your regular blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:26:32 Use them to weigh down certain parts of your craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:27:29 DragonMage can you just shut it, you're saying common knowledge, and not only that, you went with neg at first instead of nag, and neg is more commonly associated with nig rather than nag
creations-chat 2018-11-20 17:27:38 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:28:10 Then you know what to do, don't apologize for us, apologize for your damn self, since you're the one at fault
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:28:24 Also, what do you need yousuf?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:28:40 I think it just attracts to anything
creations-chat 2018-11-20 17:30:36 Whatever you want
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:31 Force = Mass X Acceleration
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:45 You've got alot of acceleration, not alot of mass, so your force is very light
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:31:56 Guy shredded you in PVP mode?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:32:51 ... Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:12 If you're so insistent on being so toxic, then so help me
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:33:50 You refuse to apologize for anything even though you're completely and entirely wrong, and instead you kept on trying to deny your own faults and assume we're the ones at fault, primarily with misinterpretation
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:34:22 Then you meant it in a racist way
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:34:35 And if you meant nag, then you need to apologize for accidentally putting it in a racist way
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:42:40 Rule 10 ... It's the weakest one sure, but rule 10
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:43:05 Oy, no calling people names sonnuy
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:43:25 Even if they deserve it, try to minimize it at least
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:43:43 ... Rule 10, last warning Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:44:27 Where does it say the word "please"? I only see a foreign language, likely pumped through Translate
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:47:15 Just how did Future insult you in a way that was either unprovoked, unwarranted or excessive?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:48:39 I believe you mean version 9000 sonnuy
On a more serious note, it was warranted, after all the crud you've done Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:50:56 Ahem, rule 10 Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:51:12 Provide a translation alongside it and it'd be fine ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:51:49 Then translate what you're saying Dragon, if you want to talk in spanish
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:52:56 Example in reverse: "(Using Google Translate): Hello "你好""
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:52:59 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:53:15 It's an example Flame
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:53:23 That actually doesn't break rule 10
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:53:32 Because RULE 10 IS STILL A RULE
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:54:01 I'm about to enforce it on his face if he tries it one more time
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:55:20 Lump it together Dragon ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:55:47 In the same line ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:59:36 That's fine guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 17:59:52 Don't bug him for that, he's doing the example I showed, so, by technicalities it's following the rule
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:01:37 The same thing can mean different things in different languages
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:02:01 Er, sorry if I killed the joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:10:06 He's correcting you
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:10:23 Because he's correcting your thing, which is already translated
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:11:32 Escape pods?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:12:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:13:01 "Too durable for us"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:15:03 Rule 10 for consistency and ease in chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:15:20 It's probably the most flexible rule of them all, but still
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:17:26 Destroy the Core! (+10 if you know where that's from)
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:17:52 Incorrect
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:18:06 Wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:18:12 I'll give you a hint: It's a SHMUP
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 18:18:28 Correct
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 23:54:55 Then tell us what the reason is
creations-chat 2018-11-21 01:55:14 Sounds like a weight/thrust imbalance, check your center of lift and any motors/engines
help 2018-11-21 01:56:36 Thrust's even and such as well?
help 2018-11-21 01:56:56 You might have a slight wing deficiency, wings cause a stunning amount of drag
help 2018-11-21 01:57:02 And if you look at the center of lift, it's slightly off
help 2018-11-21 01:57:05 So double check your wings
help 2018-11-21 01:57:12 If they're not off, that means you have extra mass somewhere
help 2018-11-21 01:57:21 So you need to double check your block placement, including internals
help 2018-11-21 01:57:29 If neither are true, then I have no idea what's wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 02:10:27 Maybe not with the same curviture on the wings and such, but yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 02:11:36 Oh, you mean the Ho-229, , kirz means his plane I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 02:12:02 To make that one fly, you either want internally mounted engines, or to do what modern B-2s do, which is for both flaps on one side to open up
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 02:12:14 Which, isn't really too viable in Plane Crazy, but good luck anyways
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:50:59 Looks pretty freaking nice
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:51:31 I'm not sarcastic
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 02:54:12 Double up on it? Make it go even faster?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 02:58:05 Try posting a picture of the save slot if you would
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 03:01:43 Wanna test it out against my fighters?
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 03:29:35 Huh? Ignore me while I casually clean up the arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 03:29:49 Like the whole server's after me and I'm winning
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 03:32:16 The MK2 is just that well built
bug-reports 2018-11-21 03:38:09 You can still hit yourself in the PVP mode
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:08:29 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 04:22:40 Any suggestions on what I should paint my MK2 fighter?
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 04:22:53 This picture's outdated now, but gets the point across
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 04:23:03 Note: The cockpit is now solid, not glass
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 04:23:17 Nobody's pinging you
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 04:26:55 Anyways, got any idea for paint?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:17 1: What color should I paint this
2: Did I make the belly too fat?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 04:59:44 I'm trying to revamp the MK2 into a MK3
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:16 The goals would be a stronger central spine, engine protection of some sort and redesigned wings
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:00:27 So, did I make the belly of the craft too fat, or?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:50 The belly protects some underside boosters
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:01:59 OH F- same picture, whops
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:02:09 
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:02:41 
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:10:00 Added more armoring on the fusilage, topside this time
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:10:52 Any opinions?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:03 General cockpit area's painted black, any ideas on what I should do for a color scheme?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:32 I can recolor the general cockpit area you know
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:14:42 I just painted it black to make that area obvious
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:16:35 Alright
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:17:31 So, the main fuselage would be blue, similar to my superfighter
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:17:46 Wings I want something on them though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:27:35 The MK3 fighter, an enhancement over the MK2 in durability and maneuverability, with modified wings in order to provide a more stable flight
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:27:50 Might recolor the cockpit though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:29:45 I literally used 110 blue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:30:08 Also, from now on, 110 blue and 150 red are my corporation's primary colors
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:30:16 And Fea_rr, you're not limited to square, use wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:31:19 The only thing this thing needs is more weaponry
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:32:34 If rockets were homing, it could mount 8 forward facing ones and 2 rear facing ones without compromising look
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:36:03 Go for it
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:37:47 I will give you one hint: Around the 200-400 mark's what I landed on
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:38:23 For sake of an actual challenge, it's primary thrust has to be forwards
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:02 I find that anything smaller than 200 can get crippled easily, anything larger than 400's an easy target
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:40:29 Hell, the original MK 2 was only 267 parts, and if you didn't notice, it had a very thin spinal area
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:41:13 You want your profile to be small as well, with the MK3, it's profile's wider in some areas, but it's still really narrow compared to other fighters
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:14 It's fine if one target profile's really wide, in my case, the top and bottom, but you need to make the others really thin, in my case, the side and especially the front
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:42:52 Observe
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:43:46 For comparison, here's the top profile
creations-chat 2018-11-21 05:44:20 Freaking huge in comparison, an easy target, but the thing is that it's pitch is so great that it can turn to face it's targets
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:20:55 Done
help 2018-11-21 06:25:34 A fighter in Plane Crazy is literally any plane that has adept or better combat capabilities
help 2018-11-21 06:25:50 So no 20 block planes, we're talking ones that can fly fast, maneuver on a dime, take a hit, and deliver a serious punch
help 2018-11-21 06:26:10 If you build one well, it'll fall under all those categories on it's own
help 2018-11-21 06:28:05 My original MK 2 fighter was quoted to be like a eurofighter
help 2018-11-21 06:28:27 Only thing it couldn't do was take a hit, specifically on the spinal section of the craft, considering there's only the structure blocks there
help 2018-11-21 06:28:51 The MK 3 solves this by adding a layer of armor along the spine, and re-structuring the wings for a more stable flight
help 2018-11-21 06:29:03 It also updated it's engines to use super rockets instead of jet engines
help 2018-11-21 06:31:06 Yeah, that's the basics of a fighter, now go make one of your own!
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 06:36:38 Level all-terrain climber with custom wheels?
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 06:36:54 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:47:00 Oh holy crap, it's like you had a giant chunk of stone, then started carving out a statue
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:47:03 Niiice!
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:49:02 Uhhh, okaaayyyy then? What, exactly do you want with it gage?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:50:26 Ehhhh, alright, it's not really showoff-worthy though to be fully honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:50:44 People are impressed by huge, complex, beautiful and/or generally amazing creations
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:14 Or really cool design processes like Ogami's, he's almost literally chiseling out his wing craft from a bunch of blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:26 Uhhh, what?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:51:52 Oh, OOOHHHHH, nice one actually
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:09 Sorry, just, sorta unfamiliar with Robot Wars/Robot Arena/Battlebots
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:20 I love the concept, and I want a game based off of it, but I'm unfamiliar with them
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:52:46 Yeah, build your own robot to duke it out with other robots
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:53:23 Robot Arena 2, best Robot fighting game
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:53:36 AA system with a very solid base?
general 2018-11-21 06:54:00 Oh wait no nevermind, ops, read 1 too many digits
general 2018-11-21 06:54:12 Got the next best thing though
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:54:32 Honestly, RA3 is abandonware we don't really talk about
general 2018-11-21 06:54:43 For?
general 2018-11-21 06:55:19 Show the block count?
general 2018-11-21 06:57:06 Ehhh, remember, land-based creations have double count
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:15 Okay okay hold on a bit
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:32 Builder ranks are doubled on land
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:41 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-11-21 06:57:55 Alright
general 2018-11-21 06:58:09 Still need the part count if possible
general 2018-11-21 06:58:28 I'm able to estimate in the 500 region, but further than that and I get less accurate, to the point of 2K creations being nigh impossible for me
general 2018-11-21 06:58:37 Gyazo's not showing up
general 2018-11-21 06:59:00 The boat's not showing up
general 2018-11-21 06:59:11 Page not found ...
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:00:24 Second one, alot smoother
general 2018-11-21 07:01:38 Enjoy killing servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:02:17 "Breaking news! Roblox bans Fck and Peeple"
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:02:39 Basically a cramped version of a huge rocket, except with a bit more strength
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:02:48 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:03:05 Make it controllable in the air for it to count, alright?
general 2018-11-21 07:04:47 Go for it, also put that stuff in <#504436696021204992> if you want to show them off
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:05:43 I'm off for today, g'night everyone
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:08:32 Your own votes aren't counted, that'd be just unfair because those are givens
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:08:47 And we can see who voted by the way, so if you remove your vote and someone else votes, you'll get it
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:09:12 Oh look, someone else voted, I wonder who did that?
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:09:23 You're welcome
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 07:09:52 That person left
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:17 Folders existed for a while, and I mean ever since motors existed
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:24 And I believe that associates paint as well
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:36 So, sorry Duck, but no, no inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:18:44 New mechanisms, not iterations on existing ones
bug-reports 2018-11-21 07:22:31 Probably because they're complex pieces
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:22:37 Either novel or useful
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:23:47 You can't sadly
bug-reports 2018-11-21 07:24:07 Oy, don't cheese it or so help me I'm shoving a block of cheese on your head

creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:24:55 The first one's novel, a truck that transforms into a crab machine
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:04 The second one's useful, a modular building system for vehicles
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:13 Both obviously already done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:25:45 They both qualify for inventor by the way, infact, we're running out of inventor trophies for him
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:02 Nope, modeler maybe, but a washing machine has already been done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:11 So you're too late for that
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:25 You're gonna have some backflipping issues Ogami, but good luck
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:27:48 Transforming vehicles? Yeaahhh, blame Ignacioel again
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:00 Again blame Ignacioel, he sniped like 50% of Inventor-worthy things
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:47 How about build a train that can lay down it's own tracks
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:54 It picks up the ones behind it's self and lays them down infront
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:28:57 THAT will get you inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:29:46 Modeler boymahina, not invenetor
creations-chat 2018-11-21 07:31:42 Frog jumping's already done
creations-chat 2018-11-21 18:05:16 No Man's Sky?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 18:06:53 Hey, it looks pretty nice honestly
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 18:07:19 Massive, and intimidating?
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 18:23:04 Uhhh, I already found a reason for cameras
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 18:23:13 Reason for cameras, right there
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 18:23:27 The cockpit's sealed and the camera lets me use a first person mode for more precise aiming
creations-chat 2018-11-21 19:56:11 I was afk for a while, and which piece?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 19:56:33 Alright, the fuselage is the least noteworthy part to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:23:57 That's the agility you need in order to maintain combat effectiveness
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:01 You aim via practice
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:13 Sorta
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:22 Well, not for rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:26 Those are near useless to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:24:34 Actually, I only use keys to fly that thing
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:25:10 Community server?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:25:54 Happens alot
creations-chat 2018-11-21 20:28:28 I'm in A PVP server, but I'm not sure I'm in yours
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 22:59:38 Center of lift too far back
plane-crazy 2018-11-21 23:06:54 We get it "Kaden", now can you please stop? You're sorta spamming up the chat
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:15:06 Ahbupupup, no Grab, no further, got it?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:10 AHEM
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:32 Clean it up, now ...
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:17:57 Meaning BOTH OF YOU <@!340543153922768906> <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:18:16 Rule 2's the easiest to enforce because it's got the least grey space, and you're in that space now
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:18:22 Yeah trollgein?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:25:55 AAHHHEEEEMMMMMM
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:26:09 You forgot, it gets submitted to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:26:26 You are in serious, serious shit, both of you
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:27:08 Mhm, you said this wouldn't happen the first time after entering the server, and then THIS happens
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:15 Now both of you shape up, GOT IT!?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:34 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/514956105210789899/unknown.png
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:28:34 He painted this skin colored after Grab egged him on to do so
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:29:38 If you want a good STOL, you need great lift
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:02 That's because you have alot of lift near the front
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:10 If it goes up too easily, pull the center of lift back, but add more wings
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:23 If it's too difficult, push it forward with more wings
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:30:57 For a creation of that size, you want them almost, if not merged into eachother to a certain degree
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:31:06 Amazing example of an STOL
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:31:25 And I say this not to toot my own horn, but because this thing floats down like it's got all the parachutes attached
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:06 You have a huge wing to fuselage ratio then
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:19 It's called the magnet drive
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:32:26 Aka: Warp drive
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:33:02 Let's see then
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:34:24 I meant Lumber, I think you're fine that
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:37:36 No thanks
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:48:57 What?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:15 ... What?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:32 It's already gone
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:49:36 Also, huh trollgeinu
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:50:23 Jesus christ, dude, calm down
creations-chat 2018-11-22 00:56:52 Uhhhh, huuuuhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:35:58 Lumber ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:36:20 Can you not, deal with what you have for now, and maybe you'll get it back eventually
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:36:33 But keep on bugging us to bring it back, and we'll continue to ignore it, or worse
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:37:15 Deception's been a member for quite a while, so maybe you ought to shut it Lumber
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:37:45 Plus, he's lighthearted, and doesn't attack people unless they deserve it, so unless you KNOW you deserve it, assume he's just trying to have a good laugh
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:38:02 Aka: No malice, negative feelings, etc
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:38:19 ... This isn't yelling
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:38:36 If I wanted to "yell" via typing, __**I'D GO LIKE THIS ASSHAT**__, that's extra harsh to sell the point across by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:39:09 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:39:42 It's sorta like "YOU ASSHOLE!" except, more, I don't know, the best I can describe it as is more British or something
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:45:31 Looks like a railgun style barrel Deception, it's fine, but it's also too narrow at the base
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:45:58 Right at the base of the barrel
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:46:04 Both sides
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:46:16 Tada
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:46:27 Try it with single, tripple, and double _
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:46:34 __***YOU CAN GET STUFF LIKE THIS!!!***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:46:55 Kiwi didn't, so we're screwing around a bit with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:47:10 __***BLAAAHHHHH!!!!***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:47:14 Use two _ on both sides
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:47:29 Not -, _
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:47:37 Hold shift when using -, and make sure there's 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:48:10 ~~__***Observe this beautiful test***__~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:48:26 Use ~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:48:34 Read this for instructions

plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:48:55 'That's because you're using code blocks, like I am now, blaahhh'
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:49:00 Wait whaaat?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:49:01 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:49:06 `Now?`
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:49:08 Yeup, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 04:49:31 I sorta love how we all just dropped everything just to have a bit of fun with the chat
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:56:00 Damn Lansink! Nice one
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:56:52 Xero, what's the issue with it? Or does it actually work?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:57:38 Plumits how so? Nosedives, or?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:58:18 Ah, center of lift too far forwards, thrust too far down
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:58:59 Think of applying a force to a see-saw
creations-chat 2018-11-22 04:59:40 Ignore every other force and cut it down the middle, then think of how applying the force would work
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:07 It'll make it worse
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:16 If you pull back too fast, it'll make it worse
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:01:26 Instead add thrust up-top and drag the center of lift slightly further back
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:02:05 This is a very, VERY stable creation, take a guess why
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:02:46 The center of lift is blue, center of mass is yellow
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:03:32 Actually, that's false Xero
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:03:46 I'll give you a hint, this is an older version, with jets instead of rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:22 Er, not quite
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:29 The reason it's so stable is because there's jets on the underside
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:35 These jets cause it to rotate upwards slightly
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:04:44 Which is countered by the downwards rotation due to the center of lift
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:05:14 Yes, the center of lift is in the back, which causes this craft to pitch downwards at low thrust, but at high thrust, the thrusters on the underbelly counteract this downwards pitch
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:05:42 You probably have too much underbelly thrust and too much upwards pitch Xero
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:06:07 Either drag the center of lift farther back by adding more wings in the back, or add thrusters on the top, so as they activate, they cause it to pitch downwards
help 2018-11-22 05:08:04 Is it just slamming it's nose into the ground?
help 2018-11-22 05:09:08 No lift?
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:09:21 It just clicked for me one day
help 2018-11-22 05:09:52 Yeup, center of lift's WAY too far back
help 2018-11-22 05:09:59 Slam it forwards
help 2018-11-22 05:10:34 Bump that mega delta wing forwards, or do what I did
help 2018-11-22 05:10:41 And put wings on the front
help 2018-11-22 05:10:53 By the way, no copying my design! Iterate your own features onto it
help 2018-11-22 05:11:55 You need to modify the design kiwi
help 2018-11-22 05:12:24 More weight in the back, more lift in the front, and possibly more thrust on the underbelly
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:12:36 It pulls up too fast, doing backflips from what I'm judging
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:13:37 I believe so
creations-chat 2018-11-22 05:18:02 The issue is is that from experience, it's not forward enough to really cause uncontrollable backflips
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 19:29:00 The TIE interceptor has 4 prongs, that one has 3
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:37:37 Looks like the First Order variant
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 19:37:53 You can paint all sides of a paint block
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:38:09 First Order TIEs are far, FAR more durable
creations-chat 2018-11-22 19:38:36 True, but one took a literal missile and didn't get blown into atoms
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:21:46 Slaba, you really want to 1v1 someone with a turret?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:21:59 I'll convert my fighter to a bomber then and dump missiles on you in a flyby
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:22:20 It won't out-maneuver my fighter, trust me
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:22:30 Empire can confirm that, right Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:23:09 Let's see then Slaba
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:23:46 I'm in the PVP mode now
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:25:06 Just warming up on an entire server vs me
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:26:40 One note: Self-kills do not count, they are a BUG, not an intended feature
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:26:55 So if one person suddenly breaks up for no reason, that's a self-kill, which doesn't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:29:12 Well then
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:32:53 Slaba, come on, which server are you in? Community?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:33:55 VIP's server Slaba, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:34:39 So are you wimping out after saying that you'll wreck anyone?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:34:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:39:15 Both of you cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:40:12 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:42:21 ... Teal, you also should be warned for trying to break Rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:43:30 I'd say, ban, he's the kind of immature shit that won't learn no matter what
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:45:50 Thanks MX
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:53:42 What do you mean? Like the tiny one it's inset into?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 21:53:57 Sorta
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:05:22 Slaba, you saw what happene to Tealur, do you want the same fate?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:05:40 He was about to be banned, so he tried evading the ban via leaving early
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:06:11 Now ya scared?
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:06:51 Inferno, don't coax it on please
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:07:41 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:09:26 This has been a busy day ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:09:58 We can remove warnings now, so if it's false the others have the ability to remove it
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:10:03 ... Fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:16:25 Gonna just sweep that away just incase Future
plane-crazy 2018-11-22 22:16:42 Uhhhh, alright then
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 00:55:41 Okaaayyyy then
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 00:55:44 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 00:55:47 You know who it was?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 00:55:56 Imperial, it was, let's just say, well
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 00:56:13 Let's just say it's very, very, blunt
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:05:00 Let me guess Tealur, you don't like me because I try to enforce the rules with a freaking medieval axe compared to others?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:05:12 I've been trying to get better at that
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:05:17 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:05:29 Well that's my main complaint many times
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:06:30 Eh, when I'm friendly, I'm very friendly, but if you piss me off, well, off goes your head executioner style
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:06:51 Also my life's been very busy with college, hence my relative inactivity compared to before
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:07:21 Ehh, they might be too hard-headed for that
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:08:00 Yeup, I do NOT like spiders, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:10:35 Alright Dust
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:11:01 It's the MK3 of a previous fighter, enhanced pretty much everything now
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:11:23 Good luck punching a plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:11:57 With very little effect, right Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:12:14 Okay fine, SOME effect, about 2-3 plots worth

plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:12:50 Here Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:13:26 It's Ignacioel's creation, based off of the Intrusion 2 Grabber boss
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:13:41 Simply put it's an "Armed" transport
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:14:07 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:14:09 That thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:14:44 Wanna test that out then Orange?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:14:54 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:15:00 No idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:15:21 I win, 1K+ part creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:15:25 VIP's server
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:17:16 I don't think you can join PVP servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:25:08 Currently fighting like 10 people in the arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:25:18 1 of which is a damn starter plane ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:54:37 Maneuverability, Speed, Durability, Profile size, and unique abilities, that's the order
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:54:44 Build a plane following that and you'll be good
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:55:39 Guess where the missile hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:56:13 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:56:21 Guess how combat-capable it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:56:32 It's still fully combat capable
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:57:02 Everyone says "I can destroy James' plane" "I can destroy James' fighter", let's put that to the test Imperial, shall we?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:57:30 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:58:16 What you need is punch-through and a crazy aim
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:58:28 Spread won't work
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 02:58:34 Make the motors spin forwards sabas
help 2018-11-23 03:02:37 I don't think that'll affect it
help 2018-11-23 03:02:43 Check your engines
help 2018-11-23 03:02:52 If not, check your center of lift and center of mass
help 2018-11-23 03:03:03 Trust me, it doesn't, the center of mass doesn't shift like that
help 2018-11-23 03:03:13 If it did, it'd be alot easier to shift the center of lift and/or center of mass like that
help 2018-11-23 03:03:35 But as it stands, it was a bitch to get this creation working, even placing stuff on the floor
help 2018-11-23 03:03:41 So no, placing stuff on the floor won't affect it
help 2018-11-23 03:03:49 Yes it will make inaccurate readings, but the actual readings will still be there
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 03:45:44 Use motors
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:27:40 Not in the mood for this, Totten, quit trying to brag about your cubes, I come back from being fucking traumatized from stress and I see Totten bragging again, which just pisses me off to high hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:28:24 Then show us the progress, so long as you don't submit it in <#504436696021204992>  or <#504630474853974032> , you can spam out updates more easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:28:50 It's sorta what I did to get a bit of help from Empire earlier, but you need to have some meaning behind each one, not just "oh I repainted this"
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:30:59 The MK3, remember Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:31:30 You helped me out with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:31:50 Totten, show us your best build then
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:32:03 Best build for function
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:32:10 Best build for fashion
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:32:47 The MK3, which is the top one of mine, is a dream to fly, the Superfighter, the bottom one of mine, is also highly functional, just not to the same extent as the MK3
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:33:02 It's probably the most distinct, but it's definitely not the absolute best jope
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:33:36 Now then, let's see yours Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:34:30 Just show us what in your opinion is the best then
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:34:46 Spooky, do you mind just DMing one of us?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:35:01 Reason why is you might scar someone in the chat
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:35:57 Rule 2 spooky, just incase, I know you didn't build it, but still, just incase
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:37:55 They're probably cubes or a giant cursor
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:38:17 I believe you misplaced a 0 on there
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:38:24 It should be 1/100

plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:39:15 Observe his "creation"
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:39:37 Uninventive, uncreative, unimpressive, and generally makes my eyes bleed
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:39:54 AHHHEEEEMMMM <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:40:16 Explain yourself Grab, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:40:50 So many people know about how shit it is, that's for sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:41:30 Complete garbage? Agreed
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:41:40 Then what was it based off of?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:41:48 "Smooth plane" ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:42:01 The folding boeings are smooth planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:42:05 B2s are smooth planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:42:14 Your cursor? It's not a smooth plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:42:57 Ah, the Ho-229 isn't a cursor
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:43:11 It looks nice to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:43:59 You were trying to make a flying wing aircraft, weren't you Totten?
creations-chat 2018-11-23 22:44:12 Try using wedges?
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:44:53 If "smooth plane" is what I think you two are trying to say, it's a flying wing aircraft, the Ho-229, and the B2 stealth bomber are real world examples of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:46:13 Someone made a near 100% smooth B2 ya know ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:47:09 Well, it does seem to be he/she put actual effort into it, rather than just engine spam
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:47:49 Empire, it might just be a mega fleet, that's one of the things I did want to try at one point, multiple craft in one creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-23 22:49:27 I mean, there's EFFORT put in, unlike just spamming a giant box ...
creations-chat 2018-11-23 23:03:41 Got shredded a bit Fea_rr?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:07:02 What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:07:43 Someone give me a short summary? I'm sorta slightly (Only partially joking) dying here
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:08:28 Teal, look in the channels
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:08:51 Bry, it depends
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:08:57 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:09:02 You're outa luck for that, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:09:13 With the way Roblox teleportation works, that won't work no matter what you do
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:10:54 Use ~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:10:57 ~~like so~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:11:18 ~~__***HERE WE GO, FUN WITH DISCORD MARKDOWN TAKE TWO!!!***__~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:11:35 Yeup, that happens bry
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:12:25 ~~__**WHAT'D YOU SAY!?**__~~
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:13:19 Okay enough going berserk with the markdown guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:15:49 I've quarantined the dump from me after I saw a pile of spiders there
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:16:19 **Hello_HerpedyDerp**
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:16:57 If you know the first thing every coder's asked to make during their school years, you'll get the joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:22:37 Huh, cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:26:18 Ohohoohhno they did not!
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:26:57 Let's stomp their faces into the ground, just to show them who's the better place builder
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:27:11 Also don't bug them, they might start trying to raid us afterwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:28:55 Use the VIP server NewDude
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:51:48 Quick note: HOW THE HELL COME DOES TEALUR HAVE A TEAM BEFORE ANY OF US HAVE!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:52:24 He's got the whole "Red Knights" thing, god dang it
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:55:58 I can't make a group, but I did want to make one themed around sort of a scifi style, hence the MK3 fighter (I need a name for it), and the superfighter (Also need a name for it)
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:57:10 Okay, I suck at folding, and the superfighter can NOT maneuver that well
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 01:59:08 Done, ranks back
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:00:49 The arresting wire and catapult launcher are part of the carrier, not the fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:05:22 Heh, trust me, anchors to stop mid-air make you absurdly vulnerable
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:05:45 Like, you need to lock onto the target somehow in order for anchors to be actually useful, otherwise you're just a sitting duck
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:06:03 The only ones that are remotely successful are turrets, and those get annihilated by rockets
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:06:13 Nice one Far
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:06:44 Someone tried that, a guy just parked up behind them and shot them until their person was hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:07:35 I've seen double sided turrets before, but again, those are really unsuccessful
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:11:28 A proper unicycle, wait
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:11:34 A PROPER UNICYCLE!?
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:11:41 Helium usage?
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:12:47 Welp
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:13:18 If you could make one auto-self right, I'm pretty sure we'd have to make our inventor ranks out of tinfoil
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:13:31 Like, without any inputs and helium
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:14:03 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:26:12 Mmmm, maybe, it's hard to tell
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:30:03 Come on, where's the love for scifi?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:30:38 Paul, all at once please
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:34:23 Does Ghost give you credit?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:34:38 Look at Ignacioel's climber vs Ghost's
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:35:42 They're both the same ...
creations-chat 2018-11-24 02:35:52 Welp, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:39:02 Ah, so you two know eachother, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:45:02 Stefano, shut it, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:45:11 That kind of joke's not funny
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:46:14 Now speak in whole sentences, and promise to not make any more jokes like that before I freaking rip your mouth off (in the server sense, aka mute) and shove it back down your throat, and hope you choke, **GOT IT!?**
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:46:26 After today, suicides are not funny for me ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:46:57 I'll be fine potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:47:24 Hey Teal, look
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:47:48 Yeah, also, nah, it's sorta life stuff to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:47:59 So even if I took a break it'd still be the same, may as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:48:09 Let's see it Teal
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:48:47 Welp, it is a rollercoaster, and it is the first rail based creation I myself have seen
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:49:53 I know, if it doesn't count we can remove it, but if it does, it stays
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:50:16 It's to prevent tiny spam, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:50:50 Try typing out long sentences, rather than spam "BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH  o wait i am su pp o s ed to type in sentences ? my bad" (Each space being a new line)
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:51:20 I believe so
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:51:27 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:53:22 Well, how about modeler instead Teal?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:54:08 Inventor's like the gold trophy, modeler's like silver
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:54:38 Mmmm, how about we say "Stay" for now, but if any proof comes up we cancel it out, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:54:46 Also, Teal, complete sentences, slowmode doesn't like fragmented sentences
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:56:33 Teal, come on, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:57:02 He must've typed "@ imp", then pressed enter immediately
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:57:34 You should've gone "Fuck you auto-fill" if that's what you meant, but to say "fuck you" to a mod? Yeah, that gets you mauled
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 02:58:01 Ehhhh, just one for now
bug-reports 2018-11-24 03:01:25 Magnets were already fixed in terms of lag cold, if they're still lagging you, sorry, but it's your fault, Rick already optimized it as much as he could short of completely breaking them
bug-reports 2018-11-24 03:02:00 Optimize them any more and they simply go kaput
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:02:13 Uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:02:14 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:02:26 __***GUYS***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:02:30 Ahem
bug-reports 2018-11-24 03:02:50 Couple weeks, maybe a month or two ago, some time within that timespan
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:03:19 Oh, OOOHHHH, okay yeah no I'm surprised nobody caught it
bug-reports 2018-11-24 03:03:34 Mhm, guess how Warp Drives came along
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:04:17 Uhhh, sorry, but no
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:04:26 Previous one might've been fine,ish, but
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:05:09 I'm usually lenient on that stuff, but that, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:05:24 I think the first one was a bit much, would've required a ton of digging
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:05:27 It was his profile image
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:05:42 Simply put the first one was of a, well, let's just say it's a wrapper for something
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:06:00 Second one was straight up, part of a cell
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:06:43 Nice one Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:08:27 Oh my freaking GOD IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SERVERS NOW
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:09:12 Teal ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:09:14 You're pushing it
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:09:49 Trying to find your server Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:09:51 No luck
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:12:55 Oy, Ignacioel, on Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:14:50 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:15:33 How do you think the MK2, 3 and the superfighter feel? I'm the only ones that own anything like them
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:20:13 Teal, seriously ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:20:22 Trust me cold, today's not a good day
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:20:29 Yes Nyte?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:30:15 Like tiny gliders?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:31:12 Everyone copies your creation Ignacioel, seriously, no attention to mine though
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:33:52 Why don't you give it a try then cold?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:34:01 Also, if you want transformers, blame Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:34:19 Alright, VIP server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:37:35 I'm going to stay out of this ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:38:05 Empire, Imperial, Orange, go apeshit on whoever you want to, good cop ain't here anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:47:19 Cold, cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:50:02 ... COLD, CUT IT OUT, **NOW**
creations-chat 2018-11-24 03:50:15 Good job Malicious
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:51:43 Hey, gun harmonization, cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:52:47 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:52:58 Oy, Ignacioel, FR on Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:53:34 Friend Request, so I can join your server
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:54:08 He's got gun harmonization already, which is a key part of WW2 era planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:55:00 Yeah, happens alot, it's a bug
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 03:55:06 Yeup, exactly that Paul
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 17:44:58 So much WW2 stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 17:50:42 Meanwhile nobody's impressed that this thing could take a missile to the right fuselage and still work with full combat capabilities
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 17:51:55 Believe it or not, one wing is actually worse than no wings, because the lift from the leftover wing will cause it to roll
creations-chat 2018-11-24 18:05:57 Welp, you got one thing right, it's fat
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 18:49:12 RIP, as consistent as a pile of potatoes
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 18:49:27 Wait, it's not down for me, really slow yes, but not down
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 18:49:45 Erhm, NOTHING! Just a phrase, how about a pile of rocks instead?
help 2018-11-24 18:56:25 Pitch, yaw, or roll?
help 2018-11-24 18:57:29 Pitch, dedicate the interior control surfaces to up and down, 
Roll, dedicate the outer-most control surfaces to tilt in an alternating pattern
Yaw, get a better tail with more control surfaces on it
With pure control surfaces, your turning increases the faster you go
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 19:06:52 You're on your second chance, do you seriously want to ruin it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 19:08:27 AHEM
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 19:08:44 Hawk, quit joking around, we're loosing our patience with it
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:31:03 Wait wait wait, we're approaching 2K already
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:31:16 WHAT!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:33:38 Well, at least we have numbers, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:37:15 You pinged Mad and rick, seriously Teal?
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:38:43 Can you tone down the swearing? It's a bit excessive here
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:44:44 Grab, it's numbers
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:44:47 Numbers attract people
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:44:51 And eventually people outweigh bots
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:45:16 Plus if they were bots, they would've just come and gone in about half a second, we're getting just under 2K players now
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:50:12 2 pings is "spamming ping"? Seriously you two ...
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:50:46 Slaba, quit acting like an immature idiot who wants everything immediately, Teal, next time don't react so heavily to stuff
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:52:34 Slaba, quit asking
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:52:51 It gets very annoying very quickly due to a high amount of repetition
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:56:08 That'd happen alot to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-24 21:58:46 It's original, which, to be honest, it's a rare thing nowadays, how well does it perform?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:01:21 Chudy, if that's a problem then no offense, but you've sorta got a bad build, only problem I've had are with turrets (Which I just make a bomber for, so not really a problem), and really, really tiny craft (Which is why I'm making suggestions for more AOE weaponry)
creations-chat 2018-11-24 22:01:43 Show a block count if you would?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:01:58 Happens all the time Chudy
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:26:04 ... Guys, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:26:36 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 23:39:56 Pfff, nice one Vyrag
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 23:40:07 Estimating around 250 parts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 23:40:19 Er, wait, under 250 actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 23:40:28 Hey, I'm trying to guess how many parts his creation is
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:06:51 Check the VIP servers, those are usually the most up to date Kiwi
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:08:22 Kiwi, again, check the VIP servers, they're the most up to date, then check the various tabs
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:09:10 Done, you have your ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:13:12 Carrot, innovate on it, let's see what you can do
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:13:46 It's one thing to take a vehicle that's already made and rebuild it, it's another to take a vehicle and redesign or add your own design upon it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:14:05 Which directions?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:14:22 Left and right or rolling?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:14:56 That's "yaw", you want more tail fins or engines pointed left or right
help 2018-11-25 02:15:49 Try using various blocks' collisions to automatically stop it, sorta like a doorframe
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:16:28 Good example: This fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:16:36 It uses engines to assist it's maneuverability to extremes
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:17:19 Hey, if it's ugly, it's probably not as ugly as yours
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:17:48 Exactly Sea, and they don't give forward thrust either
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:18:04 Try rotating a rocket engine and seeing what happens
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:18:54 I currently have 17 flawless wins in said fighter ya know
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:19:35 Without being shot down once?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:19:52 ... You do realize I can smell the bullshit from here, right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:20:00 It clocks at about 500 while level
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:20:42 Yeah, it can also maneuver at about the size of the plot, hover in place (Without engines pointing downwards), reverse thrust and extreme durability
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:21:03 It's built for speed, right tank?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:21:18 Then why did you jump into this conversation? Just to try to bug me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:21:38 ... Then why are you here?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:21:51 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:22:09 Ah, huh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:22:19 Oh, you have a warp drive, of course
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:22:33 Warp drives = infini-speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:23:17 I don't really like warp drives, hence why I never use them
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:23:26 Alongside helium, and I very rarely use ballasts
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:24:35 Visit <#501059272675688468> , they're usually up to date, and check the tabs
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:25:05 Sea, no wonder you're so flipping hard to control, you have like no wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:26:01 It should be under Rules & Guidelines
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:00 Also, I think I know why Sea
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:13 The 3 propellers on the front provide a pull sort of motion
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:23 Yeah, longer wings do help, but also keep in mind, moderate it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:30 Too many and you'll do backflips
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:37 Keep the Center of Lift close to the Center of Mass
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:27:55 Nice, I'm estimating it's about 250, 275ish blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:28:15 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:28:25 Glitches, that's how
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:28:47 Any __means__ __**NECESSARY**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:28:53 __***ANYTHING GOES***__
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:29:03 Niiiice, not Plane Crazy though
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:29:09 But, still, nice car
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:29:32 You can poop out into the infinity dimension and back into our dimension, so long as you hit light speed, you get it
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:29:44 Ah, I'm estimating sorta based on ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:29:52 Disconnectors, disconnect
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:30:01 Just try them, attach a rocket to the end of it and disconnect it
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:30:06 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:30:37 SHUUUSHUSHSHSHSUUHUHUHHHH!
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:30:46 Flame, shuuuush
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:38:51 Yes, although not attached to a truck
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:39:38 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:40:32 It got caught on a part?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:40:43 Also, correction: Tutorial, not totorial
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:41:03 Skip the tutorial and experiment for yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:41:31 Are you able to select control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:41:42 Also, another correction: Control, not contrl
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:42:21 Alright, did you rotate them accidentally?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:43:14 Sea, that's called rolling and pulling up
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:43:23 Oh, ops Whim, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:43:48 Try it again WM?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:44:03 If not, skip the tutorial and use one of the ones in <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:44:26 Not a problem, if you need anything else, feel free to ask
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:44:45 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:10 Deltas are triangular wings that provide half the lift of their equivalent regular wing pannel
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:17 They're AMAZING for details without motors
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:22 But they're a bit crap at providing actual lift
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:28 Like that res, exactly
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:58 Good luck Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:47:38 Hint: Compress a spring to the densest point possible with rope, attach a seat onto it, and use magnets on it at all angles
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:48:05 I haven't tried that myself, but that seems to cause instabilities
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:48:14 Like, each step seems to cause a bit, and combine them all, welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:48:30 RIP res, did it tilt forwards?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:00 What's the problem Cake? There can be like 90 billion types of problems
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:07 Aaahhhh, you have no wing pannels!
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:13 Or, wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:23 Ah, you must've placed them in the inside, right Res?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:31 Aaahhh, nevermind
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:40 Your center of lift isn't loading, save and reload the creation to make it appear
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:49:48 Then put your center of lift ahead of your center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:50:39 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:50:47 What that's doing is dragging your nose into the ground and making you generically faceplant
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:51:04 Get something like this, where they're practically hugging eachother
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:51:16 Well, place one down Whimz, and check the screwdriver tool
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:52:22 You see how it works now? The red side's forwards by the way
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:53:30 You sorta can
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:53:37 Attach a rope to the side of suspension
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:53:41 Then attach suspension to the other side
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:53:58 Sorta like a sandwich, if suspension was bread and rope was the stuff you put in a sandwich
creations-chat 2018-11-25 02:54:16 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:55:28 It's not half bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:56:23 Yeah, I never said it was easy now did I?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:56:54 Uhhhh, will that even work u_wus?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:58:09 Nice, first kill
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:58:49 Wing got torn off? Shot the bomb?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:59:07 You want yellow to be as close as possible to the blue, but you want blue to be slightly infront of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:59:09 Also, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:59:38 I see you're enjoying yourself in arena mode
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:00:10 Nice, now try lifting it up
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:00:13 Rockets are stronger
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:00:18 Jets have supposedly better max speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:00:30 But super rockets, now those are special little snowflakes that are better than both
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:00:41 Captain, try making your own, just scale up the tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:01:01 I've never used props, why don't you give it a try Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:01:21 Ah, you have your center of lift too far forwards?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:01:57 ... Uhhh, could you please ease up on the meme emotes and stuff?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:02:13 Wrong way around Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:02:21 The red face is the "forward" face
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:02:29 Experiment with stuff before going insane with them
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:02:37 Nice one u_wus
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:02:45 Magnets repel and attract any block you assign them to
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:04:12 Dude, Sea, if it's been made in real life, it's probably been made in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:09:27 Whim, scale up
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:14:58 Whimz, just experiment
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:15:04 Everyone gets light speed in different ways
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:15:40 You don't __**HAVE**__ to listen to someone you know
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:15:53 Oy, <@!404731699033931786> , rule 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:16:12 Trying to make a VTOL res?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:16:21 You want to avoid wing panels Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:16:44 Nice fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:16:55 Post it in <#504436696021204992> if you want to make it immortalized
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:23:03 Ello there
bug-reports 2018-11-25 03:25:11 Explain?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:25:17 Looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:26:41 u_wus, try making your own design
bug-reports 2018-11-25 03:26:49 Let's see the setup then?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:28:38 They already are able to be colored cake
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:31:02 Use the paint tool
help 2018-11-25 03:32:06 Just ignore that one locked, it's up to Roblox to stop them
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:35:57 He's actually correct
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:36:03 That's how you add hardpoints to vehicles
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:38:53 Blame Roblox's system, not us, we can't do anything to stop it cold
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:39:05 Also, Whim, they either pull objects towards themselves, or push them away
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:39:36 You can't interact with other players' stuff, no
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:39:43 But you can use blocks to drag people towards yourself
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:40:39 OY! NO LAG BOMBING!
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:40:45 That's against the rules and will get you banned, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:42:40 Those are part counts, not lag ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:46:55 Check <#473249376223887371> more thoroughly
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:46:57 And it's fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:47:05 Be sure to parse over every single line and evade every loophole
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 03:56:05 Just use whatever
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:00:20 Trust me you get worse than shamed for it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:01:27 Tell him "You need to eithier have upwards-pointing engines, or have wings in the front"
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:02:11 150, 200 parts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:02:31 Hey, I was close wasn't I?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:03:06 Which directions?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:03:11 Left right, up down or roll?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:03:44 That's the yaw direction, you want a larger tail fins, vertical control surfaces, or engines pointing in that direction as far from the center of mass as possible
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:03:52 Think of how a see-saw works with that last part
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:04:18 Busy doing life stuff, but feel free to ask the others
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:05:45 I'll give you a hint: You need to put pressure down on the foot taking the step forwards
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:06:05 Just try walking around in real life and tell me key points you notice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:06:59 Tell him "Go ahead and try it, mods are on standby here"
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:08:02 Yes you can Keken
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:08:24 Giant multi-crew mega tank vs diddy WW2 (WW1?) tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:10:21 Tell him "Mod script threats are taken seriously, and as a result, unless you make a serious apology, you will have a high likelyhood of being banned in the next mass-culling of various trolls, exploiters, false mods and/or bots"
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:10:42 Alright, cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:11:28 If you act serious and like you know a ton of shit, you're 90% of the way there to convincing someone you're a mod
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:11:49 Wait wait wait wait wait, the NewDude in this server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:11:56 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:12:03 Blue is Center of Lift, they need to be close together
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:12:09 Put blue slightly infront of yellow
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:12:13 Anyways, NewDude
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:12:19 Do you realize what you did?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:12:25 Do you honestly realize what you did?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:13:03 Rule 4, literally right up there, do I need to drag it down and sandpaper your face with it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:13:47 Then __***DON'T PRETEND TO BE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT ONLY EASILY PROVEN, BUT A VERY VALUABLE SEAT OF POWER, OR SO HELP ME I WILL BLAST YOU THROUGH THE PLANET WITH A BAN, GOT IT!?***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:14:20 I can't **SEE THAT ABSOLUTELY PISSING TINY CHAT, SAY IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT**
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:15:03 There we go, much better
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:16:38 Done, estimating about 400-500 parts?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:16:50 Er, wouldn't really matter, it'd still get you midshipman
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:17:03 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:18:46 Hey, it flies, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:19:47 Maybe it's so far in there that we can't see it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:20:30 Done Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:21:29 I'd say a 4-5, it's not amazing, but it's something
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:23:34 It's not bad Nexia
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:23:41 Also, I think he gets lag machine, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:24:03 Also I'd say 8/10 Imperial, looks good enough to go on the logo, but it could use a bit of Plane Crazy flair
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:24:11 After all, this is plane **CRAZY**, not Simple Planes
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:24:35 Yeup, if you want you can compete in it, rate people's creations to
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:24:49 Paddleboat?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:25:15 Then let's see Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:26:20 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/516105174792798219/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:26:20 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:26:26 IT CAN FLYYYYY!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:26:45 Already done diddly given
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:27:01 How well does it maneuver Deception?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:27:10 I'm growing tired Empire, that's why
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:27:37 Then I'd say an 8, seems like it'd lack hardpoints, but otherwise it's pretty good
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:28:00 Weapon hardpoints
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:28:14 Notable hardpoints on this are on the nose, the "ear fins", and the pods
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:28:18 The side pods to be exact
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:29:22 Oh hey, say hi to Nexia, they're in the Discord to
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:29:33 Exc-
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:29:37 Show proof
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:29:48 The mono-plane you made? It's pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:30:36 ... <@!268119629925187584> , DON'T COPY, AND EVEN IF YOU DO COPY ASK TO DO SO FOR FUCK'S SAKE
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:31:20 <@!268119629925187584> **AHEM**
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:31:41 Don't copy without permission, we don't tolerate that on the best of days, __**GOT IT!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:31:56 It murders the souls and creativities of those that put actual effort into their creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:32:29 Oy, if I'm not aggressive about this stuff, nobody would take it seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:32:38 Show proof of this?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:32:57 Yeah, Totten and Dragon reaaaally took it seriously didn't they Empire? ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:33:16 As did the other few asshats that tried trolling us repeatedly ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:33:23 Oh I think I've seen this before actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:33:46 No Empire, but what I'm saying is, did they take me seriously before?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:34:08 I think we resolved this one Chilly by stating that so long as Deception gives credit, he'll be let off the hook
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:34:23 u_wus, just ask and be sure to give credit if you're allowed
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:34:42 So, Deception, do you allow u_wus to copy your creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:35:05 But the general shape?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:35:30 Alright, there you go u_wus, you can copy, but you can't copy every single detail, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:36:17 Nexia, there's 7 billion 737s, many with nice engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:36:20 Be more specific
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:37:05 Chilly, Deception, come on
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:37:16 Just break it up, Deception will give credit for it, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:37:56 And you'll give him credit for the U-boat?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:38:20 Okay, there we go, problem solved
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:38:46 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:40:59 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:41:08 Although, amphibious vehicles are pretty easy to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:41:18 Deception, he agreed to give credit
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:41:35 Er, sorry, I'm starting to hit sleep exhaustion
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:41:47 Douglas, <#501059272675688468> usually house the Discord server members
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:43:31 ... Whyyyyy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:43:53 Please shove that in <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:45:39 Go for it Douglas
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:46:43 Issue is Hawk is that certain people might have something wrong with their accounts and/or are new players themselves
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:47:06 If we want to get the final steps towards hitting number 1, we need to gather all the actual people we can
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:48:11 How do you think all the other games behave?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:48:48 Exactly Hawk, soooo, either way, we don't get any pros
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:49:28 Ehhhh, uncomfortable midsection of popularity then?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:49:41 Where we're popular enough to get attention, but not popular enough to securely boot every bot?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:51:53 Whim, if it was that easy they would've done it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:52:09 Resetting a motor makes it's position reset to it's original rotation
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:52:38 Example: A motor's rotated 180 degrees (Assume degree 0 is the original position), press the assigned reset key (Use the screwdriver tool), and it rotates back to 0 degrees
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:52:58 Because you need to assign one yourself
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:53:17 Oh FML I gave Ignacioel his next idea didn't I?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:53:25 Click on the empty space, then press any key
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:53:30 Wait, it is?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:53:39 Huh, nevermind then
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:56:41 Let me guess, copying Nexia?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:56:49 Or are you allowing them to copy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:56:50 Ah
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:56:58 That's easy u_wus
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 04:57:25 11:57PM over here
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:57:41 Try removing the wings, adding rotational thrusters and spawning in the water, see what happens
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:57:45 And, maybe more forwards thrust
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:58:46 Yeah, but if you convert it into a sub, it's able to more easily move in the water
creations-chat 2018-11-25 04:59:00 This thing's EXCEPTIONAL at moving in the water, guess why
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:00:34 Plenty of it's maneuverability comes from it's thrusters
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:00:45 So it's able to turn extremely quickly at extremely low speeds
creations-chat 2018-11-25 05:29:40 Looks like it's in a dance show and someone's shining a spotlight on it

help 2018-11-25 06:43:00 Yeah, ask when people are online
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 06:43:13 Dragon, he's got a serious point ya know ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 06:45:35 We don't have weapons against spam bots, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 06:54:06 Send it via DM
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 06:54:25 If you're wondering, I already have inventor, so why would I need to copy it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:37:45 Point, use more "neutral" style parts, the regular blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:37:56 Not helium, ballasts, or anything like that
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:38:42 Nah, they sponsored Madattak enough to make a toy out of him, so if anything, Roblox is going to advertise it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:49:23 Ahem, seriously <@!363823282581012482> ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:49:48 Nice job Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:50:14 You always could Slaba
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:50:21 You can also use half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 18:50:26 Sadly that's always been a thing Slaba
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:17:05 The tutorial tends to break half the time, and doesn't teach any of the advanced stuff, like warp drives or hinges
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:17:42 Add a survey function, "Why do you like or dislike the game"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:21:03 We don't need holdable guns, at all, they really detract from the game's purpose
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:28:09 That's all of Roblox, what's your point?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:28:56 Then wdgaf about your opinion if ydgaf about being toxic
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:32:58 That's like saying "I own the letter A, pay me 10 dollars each time you use it"
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:33:07 It's as ludicrous as it makes you look stupid
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:33:32 Then bring it out the door with you as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:34:40 You mean until you're done trolling plzki?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:36:24 ... Sam
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:36:43 One free pass, that's it, got it Sam?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:37:08 Not a problem, if it seems like it's pushing it, don't say it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:39:45 It always happens Hawk, I don't really care to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:39:55 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:40:15 plzki, someone already made a train that they built themselves
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:40:32 Erhm, sure, hold on a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:40:48 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:01 Erhm, alright, show me Metal?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:13 Then you don't want to be productive, just lazy plzki
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:23 Show me the creation with the save slot if you want ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:41 Dude, someone made a train that picked up and laid down it's own tracks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:53 Modeler is for a very distinct, very unique-looking creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:41:54 Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:42:15 In <#504436696021204992> ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:42:19 Got it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:42:32 Sadly no Whimz, it's a bit too, blocky
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:42:38 Then learn how to do that plzki, it's possible
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:42:51 I mean, another plane person Deception
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:42:54 What am I supposed to do?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:42:59 Plus he has a VTOL as well that's got more parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:43:12 Then get good, learn the game, the rest of us had to, why can't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:43:29 Wait, you're the gun harmonization guy aren't you?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:43:40 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:44:06 Done, you got your ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:44:23 I mean, hey, you're being creative at least, right?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:44:50 Not a problem, if you have any more ranks, feel free to ask me, or DM me if you want to expedite them
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:45:36 On it Metal, hold on
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:45:59 I'll just bump it up to master, since it's literally only 10 blocks away
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:46:17 Alright, what do you need help with then?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:46:48 Most ranks are based on block counts, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:47:00 plzki, airliners are speculative, meanwhile train tracks require skill
bug-reports 2018-11-25 19:47:14 Ooohhh, they act like whole blocks huh?
bug-reports 2018-11-25 19:47:35 Riiight, that's definitely a bug
help 2018-11-25 19:48:17 We classify VTOLs as vehicles that are capable of taking off and landing entirely vertically, with primarily forwards thrust
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:48:45 I mean, the best inventors usually came from making random stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:49:31 Just think of how a real life train works, then replicate the mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:49:54 That's why you make a crane that can pick them up at specific points, and place these tracks down infront of them again
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:50:07 Or you can stretch the definition of tracks and make two "train tracks" that loop
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:50:33 If you don't want him on your plot, use the blacklist feature
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:50:55 That's one of the reasons I added a reverse thrust on my plane, if I accidentally wedge myself into someone, I can reverse thrust and back up and away from them
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:51:14 Then I took it a step further and made it so flight was entirely possible in reverse
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:51:15 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:51:36 Ehhhh, no thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:52:20 Pfff, you okay Deception?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:53:31 Need to talk a bit Deception, or?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:53:54 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:54:30 You can see the list of bots in use
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:55:31 Nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 19:56:13 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:56:42 Dragon, can you quit harassing everyone before I start "harassing" you out of this server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:57:32 Pfffff, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 19:57:39 Plame swarm huh?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:04:51 Right, one at a time
<@!314219571995344897> , if you mean 126tank, why exactly? Just because he tried being a sensible person?
<@!195606011472510976> , post pictures?
<@195922155219714048> , what is it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:05:45 That's your problem Dragon, you built a bad creation
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:05:59 Right, let me pull up two pictures
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:06:03 
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:06:07 
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:06:26 This thing is my fighter, it is extremely fast, and as you see on the right, capable of withstanding rocket/missile hits without fault
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:06:41 You CAN NOT spawnkill this thing, even if you tried a full missile barrage at it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:07:08 Then what did you make?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:07:21 Then it shouldn't be in arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:08:22 Then ask him to stop, plus the private servers aren't default in arena mode last time I checked
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:09:22 I figured he'd exaggerate it of course ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:10:32 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:10:34 Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:10:36 That's not a car
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:10:44 That's a lag machine, and a trolling machine
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:10:57 Delete it, now, if anyone's at fault it's you for making a lag machine
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:11:36 ... __**DRAGON**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:12:03 Earth to Cloud Cuckoo lander! THAT'S A **ROCKET SPAM VEHICLE**
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:12:31 Now delete it, it's not well built, it's excessively laggy and it's in the wrong hands
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:12:37 Also nice job Sam
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:12:52 Dragon, do we need to repeat <#491710474786832394> again?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:13:51 And do we need to see how utterly incompetent you are with abso-fucking-loutely everything Dragon? Because I will literally search through the chat and find all our arguments we've ever had, all the times you've tried harassing me, etc
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:14:28 No sadly
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:15:01 It's how most people get lightspeed Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:15:13 Also, RIP Leo, make the suspension softer maybe?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:15:19 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:15:55 Ehhh, we'll debate it Tank, just hold your horses for now
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:16:58 Nice, what's the block count? (I'm estimating around the 150 range, maybe 200?)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:17:08 What do you mean exactly?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:17:56 Ah, alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:21:44 Dragon, nobody cares because anyone can build their own flinging machine, and probably better ones at that
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:22:06 I can already think of what can only be described as a catapult on steroids
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:22:10 Also let's see it Viking?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:24:19 The legendary Gustav railway cannon, basically a piece of artillery designed to lob stuff to Britan, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:24:35 Also, depending on what you put it on, 10/10
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:25:45 Looks a bit, merged together, try making it pop out a bit more?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:27:37 Giant rotor tail combined with an absurd control section, ehhhh
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:27:42 Not bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:29:21 Dragon, if someone wants to get flung, they're going to build their own creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:29:30 Also, it's called the cockpit Sam, and it's not as hard as you think
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:29:41 Then show us Dragon, unless you're afraid of it being another rocket spam vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:30:06 I actually had an opening cockpit on my original MK1 design
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:30:49 Dragon, just, why exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:30:56 Also, use motors and alot of wedges
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:31:08 Welp, nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:32:05 Well, let me check
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:32:13 I mean, it counts, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:32:22 Done
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:33:22 Impressive G4M3
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:39:39 Cake, try it yourself, just make a very big plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:40:10 That's because we're exponentially growing, and we've hit a rolling point
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:40:25 Most of the growth was recently though
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:40:39 I remember 2 days ago we didn't have 1K people, yesterday we hit 2K, how much do you wanna bet we'll hit 5K today?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:40:47 Nah, it's fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:41:02 Light speed's too easy
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:41:23 You want it to move like a turret, correct?
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:41:51 You got the correct idea with the motors
creations-chat 2018-11-25 20:42:01 All I can say is give it more room
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:42:10 That is literally the most stupid idea I have ever heard Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:43:00 Slaba, show us?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:43:29 Uhhhh, okay theeennn ._.
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:43:34 Hold on while I get you your rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:43:57 Done, now keep that thing away from me please ._.
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:45:09 Dragon, can you stop trying to sabotage every single fucking thing you touch? Seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:45:43 Whimz, you need good roll and pitch to do a barrel roll
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:46:56 DRAGON, do you seriously want us to ban you for not only spouting random bullshit, building lag rammers, and generally being annoying, but also harassing staff, causing mass arguments AND FOR TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE GAME!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:47:10 Left feels like a bigger plane, right feels more agile, I'd say go left Sam
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:47:27 Rule 1 only applies if it's an excess, plus Dragon pisses me off to high hell
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:47:51 Long story short, he harassed me to hell and back, and is continuously obnoxious, and a constant thorn in not only my side, but my fucking face and eyes
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:48:32 A loop is just a loop, what do you think?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:48:44 Also, you think that was a gun Metal?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:48:53 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/570f02e240261da404b66297/t/574e27d63c44d81bb19c0dea/1464739886064/
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:48:53 THIS, THIS IS A GUN
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:49:11 By the way, it is actually a real world gun, the "Microgun"
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:49:17 Handheld minigun
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:50:33 Okay, we get it, you suck Dragon, now get over your crying and do something productive rather than trying to troll the entire server, or so help me we'll treat you like a troll
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:50:40 Did you get everything else down angel?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:50:58 You can skip that part then, use the screwdriver tool to set up controls
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:51:17 Poop, sorry, there's just a few toxic thorns that we have to pluck out
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:51:29 Not a problem angel, if you still have issues, go to <#501034677793193994> , or go there for more advanced stuff
bug-reports 2018-11-25 20:52:03 Save and reload your creation, it gets rid of those ghost blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:52:23 If we're starting another "no u" war, drag it to <#495286269459300364> please
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:52:52 ... Excuse me Poop? Explain
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:53:14 Because we have more life than just making a giant K chain
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:53:22 If you want to do that, <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> please
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:53:42 Er, sorry Troy, post the picture again?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:54:02 No garuntees, but probably when we hit 1K Discord members
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:54:08 DRAGON, can you please can it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:54:42 Have that so we don't get your cancer Dragon, now then, definitely by the end of the week, probably sooner rather than later
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:55:29 <#497142796961054721> please with that alvin?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:56:08 Make it more stable Whim and I'll count it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:56:17 As it stands that was a bit too unstable
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:56:27 Glitches alvin, that's how
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:57:04 Well, mmmmm, fine Whim, let's see
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:57:19 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:58:10 Both of you quit pinging, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:58:41 ... __**GUYS**__ calm down, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:00:37 Whim, because everyone's WAY too active
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:00:46 Yes Whim?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:00:56 Alright, good for you Poop
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:00:59 Ah, hi Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:08:06 Please use English, or use Google Translate alongside it

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:13:51 Ehhh, Imperial, we might be able to make rule 10 more flexible
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:14:02 Orange, tell him to just put it through Google Translate
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:14:17 It'll translate for him instead, even if it's rough, we might get the general idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:14:36 Then sorry, but we can't really help
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:16:31 Orange, tell him "We're sorry, but we can't help if that's the case, this is primarily an English speaking server"
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:17:00 Lo sentimos, pero no podemos ayudar si ese es el caso, este es principalmente un servidor de habla inglesa (Using Google Translate)

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:28:11 ... Alright then how about I fucking DDOS your computer and turn it into a brick?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:28:39 It's a threat for people that are pieces of shit that deserve it
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:28:55 Now play nice, don't be a jerk, and be a sensible human being, and we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:29:23 What you're suggesting is to repeatedly come on in an attempt to spam NSFW style images or pictures via alternate accounts in an attempt to, basically raid this server
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:29:34 Go for it G4M3
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:30:18 Then don't threaten to come back from a ban, because that's threatening to evade moderator action in an attempt to cause more damage
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:30:53 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:31:02 Go on, we don't need cancer in the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:32:03 Guys, seriously, calm down ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:32:26 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:33:26 "No fue una broma, en lo más mínimo." (It was not a joke in the slightest)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:35:02 Intenta usar el Traductor de Google, incluso si es inexacto, todavía tendremos una idea aproximada de lo que estás tratando de decir. (Please try using Google Translate, even if it's inaccurate, we'll still get a rough idea of what you're trying to say)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:36:56 Vaya a www.google.com, luego escriba "traducir" en la barra de búsqueda (Go to www.google.com, then type in "translate" in the search bar)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:45:53 I did actually, for safety of the server
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:46:37 Guess what
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:46:51 
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:48:54 Oh it's close enough Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:50:05 ¿Puedes dejar de atacarme Dragón? se que eres tu (Can you stop attacking me Dragon? I know it's you)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:54:10 The server's sorta thrown into a bit of chaos Vanesso, we hit a milestone
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:54:35 The Discord hit 1K consecutive members at one point
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:54:47 A bit tiny, but it's pretty nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:55:13 Discord mods only currently, but more than likely we're gonna have in-game mods soon
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:55:20 Ah, nice
creations-chat 2018-11-25 21:56:15 If you want
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:56:31 Deception, don't
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:56:42 As crazy as the 1K marker is, try not to
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:56:49 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:17 300-500's good for fighters
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:43 At 200 speeds you'll be fine
bug-reports 2018-11-25 22:10:42 Probably because the chat's being spammed up
general 2018-11-25 22:12:54 They're on their way, now hold your horses
help 2018-11-25 22:16:36 Just make a vehicle that can submerge
help 2018-11-25 22:20:11 Sadly no, also, T3rr, think how to move in the air, except in the water
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:20:40 Filtered, 1 second stops soam like Teal was doing a moment ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:20:49 Also, if you can type fast Teal, do it in large bursts like I do
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:20:57 Rather than tiny individual chat-filling segments that just cause annoyance
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:33:34 A unique design is one that's very distinct
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:33:41 Sorta like this
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:34:15 Thanks Chicken
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 00:12:56 Very cool, but not unique, sorry
creations-chat 2018-11-26 01:20:25 To be honest I've grown kinda numb to your over the top and absurd (in the best of ways) creations Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-11-26 03:28:04 Ehhhhh, what's it's main deal?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 03:42:54 Gimball testing?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 03:44:06 Meh, I GUESS that counts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 03:44:22 I mean, they don't merge together, but I GUESS it counts, considering it fits the criteria
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 03:48:55 Banland, that's where, you wanna go there?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:14:00 If by "ordered block spam", you mean an actual meaningful design, such as this, then yes, but that's not block spam
bug-reports 2018-11-26 14:14:41 While going fast or going slow?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:14:55 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:15:36 boymahina, unless he adds a bunch of details to it, makes it fly and has at least three interior corridors that can be accessed while landed, won't count
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:15:45 FUCK no
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:27 Again, MEANINGFUL design, some designs are so meaningful that I've genuinely bumped them about 20 or so blocks from their next goal
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:30 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:16:35 That's not meaningful, that's still spam
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:24 When you start at least carving out a shape or adding some useful and novel interior design, at LEAST 3 floors with multiple corridors
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:49 If you can at least get inside one building, with multiple floors and a fully furnished interior, that's stretching it, but yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:50 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:17:53 That's not a city
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:18:11 You need multiple buildings for it to be a city, what you've described is a "building", and even then it's not a building
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:18:54 ... Doom, quit trying to pass no effort creations off for ranks
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:19:26 Right, if you want any ranks whatsoever, you need to put more effort into your creations, not just generically hork out an idea for a modified cube
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:19:43 Actually SOME design, SOME effort put in, to make it look, or at least look like it has some function
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:20:11 Hell, you can use the regular 1X1 building blocks if you want, but you need to think and design, you can't serve a cube on a platter
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:21:00 Now then, show us what you've got and think of an idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:21:27 Then show us
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:21:42 And next time make a big list
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:22:20 Show us a higher view so we can see the interior, to see if it's actually detailed
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:22:43 Also, it'd only get you master, land based requirements are doubled
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:04 Then show us what the prototype's got
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:28 Show us, what the prototype, has **GOT**
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:41 We'll allow it
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:44 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:23:47 Post it here
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:24:00 Just not every single picture, try the 3 best ones
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:24:50 Then force it to day
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 14:25:12 Ah, that glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:40:07 I'm going to investigate and track who it is
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:40:26 And trust me, I can find people, don't even try hiding from me
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:40:35 Nice job Whim
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:41:47 If you don't give yourself in and me or someone else finds you, say goodbye to every single thing connected to your computer
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:42:10 It's impersonation, which really, really isn't allowed
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:42:28 Infact, it's downright illegal
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:42:57 
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:43:10 So own up before an officer comes knocking on your door, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:44:59 While all these things are cool, guys, we've got someone impersonating someone else in the Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:25 ... __**GUYS**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:46:28 If any of you know who it was, own them up, or if it was you, own yourself up before one of us tracks down who it was and arrests them/you
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:53:44 You can force it to be day
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:02:51 Use regular rocket engines for flame exhausts
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:08:54 Skelli?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:09:23 He's the most recent one, and the account was made yesterday
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:09:50 The last warn was made yesterday to
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:09:54 Orange, was this today?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:10:19 Well I think we have a potential culprit then
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:11:10 Let me fix his face Blue
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:18:23 One quick incursion into a PVP server, and
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:18:28 3 sodding starter planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:26:09 PVP server, or?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:27:32 Ehhh, hmmm
creations-chat 2018-11-26 21:47:57 WELL THEN (This thing can still fly by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:53:10 Can we all just take a moment to appreciate this?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:53:17 Freaking, DURABILITY
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:54:04 Hey, the damage was focused on one side, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:54:27 Meh
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:00:17 Once the gimballing system comes out, you can expect the MK4 of my fighter to come out
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:01:55 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:01:59 Hi
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:02:18 Alright, thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 22:02:43 Nah
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:29:34 Oh hey, also, nobody said they were heat seeking
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:08 I will be honest, I do want some form of heat seeking missile though
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:30:45 They USED to be heat seeking at one point in the test server, however, I sorta showed that that either worked TOO well, or it didn't work at all
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:31:19 Nah, Super, back in the test server, if you were below a certain speed, you got murdered by them, if you were above a certain speed however, they were as good as useless against you
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:14 The speed in the test server was about 200 straight, 225 if you want to do very broad turns, 250 for comfortable turns
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:29 Anything above that and they wouldn't hit you, even if you tried to get hit by them
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:32:43 And trust me, I flew straight at a guy once, the missiles didn't hit
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:33:23 Super, again, it doesn't matter if you have the entire map as it's range, if you're fast enough, missiles can't catch up
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:33:46 Plus with their kind of turning circle, very maneuverable fighters can outmaneuver them easily
bug-reports 2018-11-26 22:36:00 If they're any faster with a larger range, they'll just peg you no matter what, if they're at the same speed, they won't be able to catch up, and even then, there's not really a good indicator that one's after you until you're hit by it
creations-chat 2018-11-26 22:43:03 We'll probably make another fantasy based replicator rank if that's the case

help 2018-11-27 04:02:52 You can stretch it to infinity, and squish it to an atom, it will try to spring back to it's original shape however
help 2018-11-27 04:03:03 Dampening is how much the shock in the spring gets absorbed
help 2018-11-27 04:03:10 Think of 0 dampening like an infinite slinky

creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:21:27 It's a bit hard to see details
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:21:37 Although to be honest it looks like a pretty nice bruiser of a craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:21:50 Ask Rick, but don't ping him about it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:21:56 My personal guess: Probably one day
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:12 It's pretty good to be honest
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:22 Center of lift too far forwards?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:22:29 Engines too far under the center of mass?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 04:23:37 The Center of Lift being too far forwards can cause the nose to lift up
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:23:48 I know, probably one day
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:23:53 Maybe even sooner rather than later
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:35:54 I'll let you guys guess, also don't tell Dragon anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:36:24 Your head's floating in the area Imperial (Trying to be vague here)

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:48:22 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:54:51 Guys, what the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:55:49 Well, he left a good impression on the mods, with a mostly positive slate
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:56:08 And he asked, so basically he's sorta taken in as a mod in training
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:56:51 Dragon, you were muted and stuff, if that's a "Good impression" then potatoe's a fucking saint
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:57:22 Oy, Sam, <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:57:53 Hey hey hey, hold on a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:58:04 <@352928457358835715> , He basically acted nice around us
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:58:26 <@!354786846049566720> , fine, do so under my name, and contact me with a screenshot of whatever's going on if you need to, I'll take action accordingly
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:58:53 You can start whenever Deception
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:59:00 Oy, he has no power, he goes over to me to figure out what to do
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:59:27 U_wus just had a clean enough slate and was liked by practically all the admins and mods enough to jump up into trainee modship
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 04:59:37 You have power, think of trainee mod as a step above minimod
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:00:21 C4RAB, one new mod, and only because he/she was very nice, and impressed us
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:01:32 Auuuugh, guys, fine, I'll open up minimodding under my name, DM me the suggested action with a picture of what happened, also, 
<@!314219571995344897> , no, you blew it before, I let you minimod and shit hit the fan, so fuck off please
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:02:17 Example: Pretend Potatoe accidentally harassed people for a brief moment, just as an example somehow
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:02:32 Just, as an example Potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:02:50 Hey, I need SOMEONE to act like it, anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:03:12 Correct response: "Potatoe's harassing people, here's proof"
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:03:19 And somewhere in there would be the proof of what happened
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:03:31 DM it to me if you want to minimod
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:03:38 Also, C4RAB, it's not as explanatory as it seems
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:03:43 Also, Sam, it's a special role for winning contests
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:04:24 Dragon, I gave you full autonomy at one point for fuck's sake, and the only result's chaos
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:05:05 You keep on (Not kept on) hypocritically accusing others of stuff that you keep on doing, so quit blaming other people and realize what you're doing
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:05:35 He did, I'm irked enough to show the results
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:05:50 Oh, whops
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:06:11 Wrong order! Sorry, my mistake, lost count of the picture
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:06:17 And I think it's 53X53, although I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:06:37 Proof of Dragon trying to shrug it off
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:06:42 
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:07:12 C4RAB, he keeps on re-igniting the fuse, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:07:20 Oy, Sam, no insults
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:07:52 That happens alot C4RAB, Empire's sorta the tough guy of our group, I guess
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:08:22 From what I know, he got muted and left
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:08:26 And now he's back
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:08:34 Ouch, we're loosing people
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:08:58 Well, C4RAB, we'll talk to him, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:09:40 Dragon, don't say anything
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:03 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:31 Pupper, it's a random easter egg
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:46 It happens on and off
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:10:54 Apparently it's Mad making the noises
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:28:32 ... Excuse me Dragon?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:29:08 That's still an indirect "kill yourself" threat
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:29:30 "I didn't finish" "I didn't finish", you're bullshitting Dragon, let's face it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:29:37 This, this is proof
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:29:41 
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:30:04 It's proof that you bullshit alot
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:30:20 You want proof you told Imperial to kill himself? Here you go
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:30:21 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/516847625547284491/image0.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:31:05 Quit trying to bullshit your way out of this Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:31:14 We all know just how much crap spews out of your mouth
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:31:38 You're never truly philosophical unless you're trying to play off something bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:32:03 Now cut the crap, we aren't the same kind of lemmings you tried this bullshit on
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:33:14 Because you put it the wrong way Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:33:31 You start off unphilosophical, then you suddenly claim "It's just being philosophical", in order to get out of a problem
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:34:18 Do you seriously want me to drag the chat down and make you look like a fucking moron?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:34:29 Infact, don't answer that, your opinion fucking sucks, I'll do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:35:19 Hmm?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:35:26 HMMM!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:35:37 __**HMMM!?!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:35:52 PROOF TO HELL, NOW FUCK OFF DRAGON, WE DON'T FALL FOR BULLSHIT
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:36:53 If you really want, I will search the chat to find the bullshit he's done
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:37:35 ... 142 pages, yeah, no, tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:37:56 See?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:38:03 I'll comb over it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:39:17 Still wouldn't find the worst parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:40:29 Meh, people might be afraid of me then, I'm only scary when I wanna break someone's face, which is only when they do bad stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:41:00 Alright, let's calm down a bit guys
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:41:23 WHAAUUUP, IMPERIAAALLL!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:41:54 Alright, Hawk, if fast typing's an issue, consolodate your typings, like I do
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:42:00 Oy, no calling people noob
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:44:20 Just stick prop blades onto a motor and experiment
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:44:26 Best way to learn: Experiment with stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:45:11 C4RAB, it's either we pick up new players or we end up like Basewars, only the hardest of the hardcore exist, as it churns through people faster than a meat packaging plant
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:45:29 Aka: A death spiral
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:46:31 Yes, C4RAB, we get you want your own personal playground, but then please go play Simple Planes by yourself if that's what you so dearly want
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:49:05 He means like a jet engine model in game
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:49:14 With actual working propellers and such
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:51:34 Ah don't worry Imperial, we know you're, at least the first in recent times
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 05:58:29 Nyte, what do you want from us exactly? Rick and Mad are asleep probably
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:02:39 Future engineering's a special rank
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:10:43 DECEPTION
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:10:46 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:11:00 Clean it up guys, for fuck's sake ...

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:12:01 Can you guys please drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> ? It's getting excessive over here
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:12:35 And ease up a bit, seriously, the chat's been flooded to hell and back with your back and forth messages
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 06:21:49 Triangular wedges are one, I think
creations-chat 2018-11-27 06:46:22 Go for it Tim
creations-chat 2018-11-27 06:46:31 Just don't spam links
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:01:51 Pfff, look closely at it compared to other warns
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:16:33 Dragon, "no u" someone one more time and I'm gonna "no u" your face, now quit bothering people
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:16:41 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:18:06 ... Hold on
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:19:01 Can you guys cut it out? I'm not in the mood for it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:21:11 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:21:21 Slowmode was added because you guys were going way too fast
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:21:27 For fuck's sake Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:21:33 For fuck's, fucking, sake
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:23:27 You were nothing Dragon if not hypocritical towards the rest of us, now **FUCK OFF**
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:24:43 What'd you say Dragon? I CAN'T HEAR YOUR **BULLSHIT** OVER YOUR **HYPOCRISY**
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:25:09 For those of you wondering, Dragon repeatedly picks on me, calling me "bully" constantly ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:25:17 And he hypocritically goes after me, constantly ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:25:26 Leave it to me Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:25:40 If he tries his fucking shit again I'm going to break his face
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:26:15 Shut it <@!256182507718836224> , I'm not in the mood for negative trolls
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:27:09 Then you may stay silent as you watch the rest of us chat, again, I'm done handling bullshit, and I'm done being nice <@!256182507718836224> and <@!314219571995344897>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:27:32 I think rockets are slightly broken for now minec, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:27:37 They used to launch out like missiles before
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:30:21 Flat people go to <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:30:50 The thing is saiyan, I was annoyed, and basically a ticking timebomb earlier, so
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:31:23 And **WHAT** the fuck, makes you think it's only me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:31:59 Alright, Dragon, fuck off into the void now
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:32:44 He repeatedly picked on me **EXCESSIVELY**
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:32:47 That's what
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:33:15 Ext, you have to read the chat for a while to get it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:34:05 For the summary of what happened, he came up with a horrible idea that was universally disagreed upon in <#491710474786832394> , we explained why it was bad, he was constantly against us, he called us bully there, and ever since then he's been causing trouble, and every time I come around to fix it, he calls me "bully"
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:34:20 Infact, he's been doing it out of the blue many times ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:37:18 Rick made an accidental update that broke arena missiles
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:37:30 But he's probably the only one working on Plane Crazy, so give him some slack
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:38:48 <#497142796961054721> please?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:43:46 There <@!431227124410482689> , as per potatoe's word you're unmuted, now don't ruin it
general 2018-11-27 17:45:38 Sorry, it's just I'm having a very, very bad day, and was oversensitive for a bit
general 2018-11-27 17:49:21 Yeah well, the joke of "Scariest mod" has some truth behind it to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:50:01 Someone already made a UAV
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:50:34 Modeled off of one of the most famous military UAVs out there, so it does look somewhat nice
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:50:37 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:51:09 Your helium creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:51:47 Can you show me the actual creation and open up any potential hidden areas?
general 2018-11-27 17:52:18 Yeah, again, I had negative tolerance at that point due to all the shit that happened, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:53:36 Hey, I never said they posted it here now did I?
general 2018-11-27 17:53:50 Normally everyone's really nice, so we don't have to bother anyone
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:55:08 Go for it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:56:21 "A prank" ... a prank wouldn't last several days against repeated requests to stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:56:45 What <@!431227124410482689> , and remember, you're going off of awesomepotatoe's word here
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:57:33 No thanks, currently busy beating sense into <@314219571995344897> 's head with a pistol
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:57:55 Anyways, if a friend dared you to do something so stupid, then why, if you had any amount of sense, would you try it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:58:07 ... Beat, <#497142796961054721> please
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:59:32 The max speed we have is literally infinite, the game breaks that hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:00:51 Dragon, leave me the hell alone, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:01:29 Oy, rule 2, no mention of that stuff here
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:01:47 Parse over the rules before stating dubious things
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:01:55 If you think it'd get you in trouble, read over it thoroughly
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:01:59 <#512414682552729601>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:02:00 Duh
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:02:28 You're literally introduced to that channel first things first ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:02:45 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with that stuff if you would
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:03:20 You can so long as they follow the rules
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:04:29 Riiiight, break it up, both of you, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:05:37 Rule, 2 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:05:53 One more time and it's facebreaking time, got it? My tolerance has gone out the window for today
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:06:45 Summary of that, I'm pissed off to high hell after alot of shit, most notably <@!314219571995344897> HYPOCRITICALLY **CONSTANTLY PICKING ON ME** __**AND CALLING ME A**__ __***BULLY***__
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:08:13 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with this if you would so please ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:08:49 Inferno, let me explain
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:09:07 ... <@!431227124410482689> , DMs, now, on a serious note, it's an actual serious issue
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:13:02 Turns out it was a joke
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:14:10 Guys, enough with the age jokes, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:14:39 It's flooding up the chat and it's not even related to Plane Crazy at all, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:14:57 It's interesting rather than chaotic or malicious
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:15:19 Not really, but I can at least bear with it, because somebody else might like it
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:15:52 Function over fashion after all?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:16:11 ... If it's off topic, **PLEASE** go to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:16:21 Also you're edging on sexist jokes there guys, which is very controversial
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:16:44 It's a joke bomb potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:17:20 Dragon, shut it, you can genuinely be 10 for all I care and you're nothing more than a liar in all of our eyes, considering you keep on jumping around, making very vague and false bluffs
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:17:47 Like what's his vehicle's dimensions or what are dimensions?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:18:13 Ah, you're using half blocks alvin
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:19:19 Prank me again and see what the fuck happens
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:26 People have made rigs before believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:35 Infact, I actually made a rig around my fighter once
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:38 Oh
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:20:43 Wait, oil rig style rig?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:21:26 Ah, finish it up and make it look unique and you'll probably get modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:21:55 Ack, can barely see anything
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:22:38 Well, nobody made an oil rig, so
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:23:47 Hey C4RAB, guess what?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:24:13 Yeup, look at your ranks
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:24:21 He already HAD inventor
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:24:49 Special rank from the challenges
creations-chat 2018-11-27 18:25:02 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:25:22 Alright alright enough with this stuff, if he continues on again leave it to me
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:25:32 Just more evidence for me to beat his face into a fucking pile of paste
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:27:22 TLDR Dragon wants to mooch off his fucking abhorrent and hypocritical bullying of me as "a prank"
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:27:37 And he kept it up long enough to be kicked once
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:28:15 Uhhhh, C4RAB, are you sure you're not half drunk? Read over what you said again
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:28:41 "**Dragon** is probably one of the best mods here"
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:29:18 Well, true, but I also have the tendency to (in a Discord sense) break people's limbs when they do something wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:29:27 Oy, looking secure is 90% of the way towards being secure
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:30:07 Why not an oil rig with a submarine attached?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:31:32 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:31:49 Right, anyways, parse over <#501034677793193994> if you really want to learn how to make a plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:31:54 To explain it would take even longer
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:32:24 Then try the tutorial again
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:36:17 Alright, now scale it up a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:36:58 Post a picture of your creation and then post a picture of the save slot
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:37:06 If it's specific creations, read over <#473249376223887371> more specifically
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:37:39 Because your "prank" is simply picking on me Dragon, now fuck off
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:38:45 Well, we can't really stop it, but yeah, preferably delete it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:40:52 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:40:55 Alvin
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:41:46 Show the DMs alvin?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:42:29 ... <@!314219571995344897>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:42:38 <@!314219571995344897> , ahem
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:42:45 ..........
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:44:05 The dump with that if you would Beat
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:45:08 It's fine, just, try not to repeat it too often
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:45:56 Like which one?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:46:28 Dragon, you haven't proven that you know shit, so sorry, but keep quiet
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:46:39 Ah, you want a half corner wedge, except in a different orientation
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:48:15 Nah, wheels automatically turn if you set them to auto-turn
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:48:44 Ask Rick, **BUT DON'T PING HIM**
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:48:54 He's busy enough as it is, so leave him be
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:48:55 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:48:57 Well
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:49:01 Don't ping him at least
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:49:21 Well, ehhhh
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:49:29 Beat, just leave a message in here
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:49:45 Oy, alvin, shush about that, don't try to start an argument
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:49:52 I'm gonna look it up to check if that's true, but don't start an argument
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:50:44 Yes spy?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:51:03 Show me what you've got?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:51:59 Done
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:52:58 You might have something alvin, but they've deviated so far from eachother that you can't really consider them the same, they just have similar meltdown mechanics
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:53:43 It's refined skill
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:53:56 Dragon, shut it please, you're mere moments away from being booted
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:54:28 It might be updated
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:54:51 Yeup, save your creations then!
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 18:56:40 <@!314219571995344897> , CAN YOU PLEASE SHUT IT, you should worry about being banned before worrying a bout your DAMN INVENTOR ROLE

creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:05:53 Someone made a U-wing

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:07:49 How so?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:08:31 ... If they're messages of hate and/or shit, then is that really harassment, or is it just us doing our job?
creations-chat 2018-11-27 19:09:10 Yeah, someone made it, issue is the swinging wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:13:27 ?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:13:55 Can you name names, or just "some of you"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:14:45 Hmmmm, no idea what it is Beat, check the F9 log?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:16:12 And what makes you think it's me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:16:37 XPERT! Seriously!?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:17:18 Xpert, he's picked on me like 90, billion times
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:17:39 Just, ask Imperial, Fonkl, Empire, Potatoe, hell, just ask anyone ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:17:49 The block button doesn't block <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:18:42 Alvin, others can see it, and for all I know he can be speaking bullshit about me and everyone would believe him ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:20:34 Honestly feeling less and less welcomed here to be honest, maybe I'll just stay silent instead
bug-reports 2018-11-28 03:31:11 You can make a temporary fix by making a sort of stopper system via pistons or motors, it'll let you jam the two back into a relatively equal alignment
bug-reports 2018-11-28 03:36:18 A good example of this is the Russian T-34 during WW2, they literally had pins that held the tracks that weren't held in place, however, they had a sloped piece of metal, which the pins grinded up against and got shoved back in, so they didn't just shake out
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:54:26 Don't bother minimodding under my name ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:54:53 Sorry, that was a big, big mistake
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:54:59 Not because it's you, but, well
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:55:03 It's just a mistake
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:55:25 I was going to let people minimod under my name, but screw that, am I right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 03:55:56 I'll let potatoe handle that, since apparently I shouldn't try to handle it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 04:16:52 "Abusing" ... This is why I've decided do whatever the hell you want, I don't care anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 04:52:38 Can you not Imperial? Seriously ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 04:52:41 I'd rather forget about that
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 04:57:28 I didn't even bother you and you take a swing at me ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:42:30 Knock knock, who's here? A serious mod
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:42:40 Guys, break it up with the age jokes please, this is getting seriously out of hand
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:43:02 Let me parse over everything very quickly
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:45:03 I'll tell gamer to cut it out, it did seem like a harmless joke gone horribly wrong, with more context required before it would've been fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:46:32 It's because of me isn't it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:49:24 That is NSFW Ethan, please erase it if you would
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:49:37 Thank you
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:50:49 We're a weird hybrid of Roblox and Discord rules
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:51:01 So we have to apply to both
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:51:28 Ahpbup, please erase that again
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:51:49 Again, weird hybrid of Roblox and Discord rules, if you can't say it on Roblox, assume you can't
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:52:11 Sorta like: "Abhupupup, stop right there, don't go any further", it's just a thing to stop people from talking/typing
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:52:18 Although it's more effective talking than typing
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:52:35 Again, we've got the restrictions of both Roblox and Discord, Roblox being the main clamp on that
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:52:44 Ethan, can you please erase the "production" thing?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:53:45 One Roblox/Discord server already got shot down because they followed Discord regulations, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:54:06 We're following Roblox regulations, that's why
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:54:35 Because Roblox regulations are far stricter on swears than Discord regulations
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:54:55 Roblox has a maximum age (in terms of language), Discord has a minimum age
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:55:32 Look, don't question it, it's a complex problem that I wish I had an answer to, or even an explanation of
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:58:24 Because the emote is still logged down
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 08:16:48 There's a Rooster Teeth video that I'd show, that accurately describes the frag bounce, but it's got swears, soooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 08:17:01 Also, not Space Engineers, Kerbal Space Program
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 08:17:59 Wouldn't really work out, but alright
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 08:19:46 I mean, that's an "alternative", although I doubt it's a good one
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 08:20:11 Alright that's enough for now
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:40:55 Hi
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:41:34 Er, <@!305738900427505664> , I have a medium/small plane, but nothing under 100 parts if that's what you want
<@!225288897024753665> , explain?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:43:06 Well, <@!225288897024753665>  think of how real life rockets work, many times you can put real life mechanics into Plane Crazy
<@!305738900427505664> , you're not copying it by the way ... you are, under no circumstances, copying my plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:51 Set control surfaces to automatic
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:50:11 Honestly I suggest keyboard, but yeah, if you want mouse controls, set it to auto control
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:01:02 It's not that turning's hard, it's that turning's easier at high speeds, and with better builds
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:01:50 Like, my MK3 fighter's turning circle, at 500 speed, is the span of the starting runway, the narrow way
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:04:34 More control surfaces and try cramming engines near the front and back pointed vertically
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:16:48 Someone went so fast the spedometer glitched and read infinite, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:16:53 You ain't breaking that record
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:50:39 What is it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:51:14 ... Totten, you have a history of overreacting similar to Dragon, so please, don't think of it as harassing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:51:28 I'll read over it, but don't expect me to side with you
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:51:57 If anything Totten, you were harassing Nyte
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:52:05 Now then, cut it out if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:52:14 I've lost the mood for this server to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:52:37 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:53:16 ... All of you, cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:55:09 Totten, Nyte, next person that says anything aggressive to the other I'm putting some tape over their mouth (aka: Mute their chat) for 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:55:29 Then cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:55:47 There, have some tape on your mouth totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:55:50 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:56:00 I'm really, really, really tired and frustrated to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:56:29 It's life, not this server
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:56:57 Nothing is wrong, okay? Now just leave it be
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:00:33 Swashplates were already invented by someone, so
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:00:52 Yes that has been made before as well
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 04:01:25 I didn't do a single thing Dragon, now can you please go the hell away and leave me be? I've had enough for a long while
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:01:35 Flying wings are already done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:01:56 Still been done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:02:15 That's been done Sak, and even then, unless the hand can pick up stuff dynamically, it'd only count as modeler
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:46:20 What's the new things?
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:46:54 Saw that before, people used it to make parachutes
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:10 I believe they have Sakura
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:38 ... No offense, but you didn't even put the landing gear correctly, so I'm starting to doubt they're actually inventor-worthy creation
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:48:52 ... Already been done, let's see, already been done
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:50:41 Wedges are lighter than blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:51:57 Show a video with comparison
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:53:16 Use the Roblox video maker and crank it through a video to gif thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 04:57:27 Quit trying to start fights nuclear before I start fighting you, alright? I'm getting even more tired of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 04:58:05 Hi
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 04:59:49 As do many other people, so quit joking around like that
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:00:08 If it's just me or 2 other people, it'd be our problem, as it stands you've pissed off quite a few people
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:00:16 Just, stay out of this mik
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:01:32 You can scroll up to find one example ... I'm not in the mood to go searching
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:02:59 You want me to search? Fine
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:03:45 You're claiming you're done only to leave it as a win for you, aren't you?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:08:48 Hold on a moment Theta, just gathering stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:08:54 
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:09:02 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/517244112857071616/image0.png
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:09:12 Proof you've pissed off people nuclear
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:09:26 Gamer complained about you, alot ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:09:41 You made an age joke, he took it "too seriously", and that happened
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:09:54 You nearly re-started the argument between Nyte and Totten
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:10:37 Anyways, off of that, Theta, would this count as a good creation?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:10:57 I actually tweaked it slightly, so now it has a gilded-esque trim on the wing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:12:15 ... This is why I don't want to be a damn mod anymore (Damn is allowed on Roblox by the way), because I keep on being bothered by everyone both high and low about every single sodding thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:13:32 Tell that to everyone that says I'm simply an extremist or unwanted
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:13:48 It winds up getting to you after a while
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:14:49 Nuclear, look up "From: Dragonmage" and "Bully", guess what you find ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:15:29 He's not the only one that treats me like it ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:16:31 ... Screw this, just, screw this, you can have modship for all the fucks I give
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:16:49 Exactly the stereotype everyone portrays me as Theta ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:17:44 C4RAB1NE, leave everyone the hell alone
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:18:18 Seriously, no offense, but I see you angry at practically everyone except a select few C4RAB
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:18:34 While I do appreciate being one of the select few, just, please, try to understand where other people come from
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:19:45 <@!184819059404046336> , 1: **CAN YOU QUIT IT!?** I'm not in the damn mood
2: __**FUCK**__ NO
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:20:24 That'd be mod abuse Deception, as per Xpert's saying
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:21:26 ... Leave, me, the hell, alone, I said my answer, it's the same whether I'm happy, frustrated, or in a suicidal/murderous mood, **N** __**O**__
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:21:55 I said that as an example, I'm never in a murderous mood obviously
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:22:28 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:22:35 Nuclear
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:22:36 I said no
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:22:39 No means no
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:22:47 Do you want me to slam you with a god damn no?
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:23:20 https://stat.ameba.jp/user_images/20170417/13/jjy4828/28/98/j/o0818081813915971491.jpg?caw=800
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:23:20 Too bad, you asked for it, no, means
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:25:43 ...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 05:26:21 Well that's me shit out of luck for being a moderator then ...
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:47:56 That looks pretty incredible, most notably due to the little ring aperture in the rear, how well does it fly?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:16 Need a fighter escort for it?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:49 These "little" (nearing 400 blocks) fighters are, in my opinion, the best of the best
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:59 At least in the current meta of the game
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:52:50 Thanks, for reference on how much damage it can take:
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:52:59 THIS THING IS STILL COMBAT CAPABLE BY THE WAY
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:53:14 Like, it could still hold it's own, very, very aggressively in a dogfight
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:54:44 Oy, if you want proof, I can rip one of the wings off and fight ya in arena
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:55:54 Also yes I am very proud of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 07:03:17 Both of you stop it before I clonk both of your heads against eachother
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 07:04:54 Okay, we get it nuclear, you only need to post it once
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 07:05:59 How we would make an indicator of that would be a problem to be honest
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:08:27 Uhhh, ahem, just, report it to one of the mods and we'll direct it to the others
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:08:54 In the mean time though, uhhh, could you please erase that, even though it's not you, it's a bit, sketchy
the-dump 2018-11-30 07:09:06 Thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 07:13:59 You're only one poke away from becoming a black hole at that point
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:11:07 Believe it or not that's actually only useful if your opponent's better at higher speeds than you (Which actually has happened a couple of times on pure control surface crafts), for most crafts, it's better to do regular dogfighting style, only occasionally toggling the reverse thrust (and decelerator) in order to maneuver better
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:12:36 Dogfighting at high maneuverability with keybinds is hell, even with mouse it's difficult without a free camera, but when you can control the turning rate, it becomes far, far easier
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:24 If it's an engineered super craft and you're fighting a boeing, it'll probably be one sided
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:33 Also, blocks have health now, and dear freaking god they're beefy as hell
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:50 Each block takes a certain amount of damage
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:14:53 Similar to the old system
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:15:36 Ehhhhh, I don't think it's a good idea to limit ammo
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:15:58 I mean, sorta good, but ehhh
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:16:34 What I'd suggest is ammo storage, usage, and production within the craft, two new blocks for storage and production, the guns can have tweaked usage
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:17:18 If you're gonna counter with "But then AA vehicles would pop up and wreck everything", that's what missiles are for, at least, if they're homing
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:17:31 Erhm, Empire, look in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:01 Yeah, I am NOT deleting anything no matter what, incase, well
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:06 I'm not gonna say it, but ask around
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:18:31 But yeah, ammo production, storage, and tweaking gun ammo usage (Possibly missile ammo usage to)
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:23:05 I feel like I could stuff some SERIOUSLY huge guns and missiles on my fighter
creations-chat 2018-11-30 08:23:17 Because as it stands, it's so floaty, everyone calls it a VTOL, but it's not a VTOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 00:10:10 When's the engine gimballing coming out? Also it was definitely Theta
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 00:37:02 Wait, what did you add Rick?
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:37:13 Nice fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:39:53 Alright, cleared out the image by the way
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:49:52 Not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:24 I'm pretty sure you don't need me to say it NewDude, but if you really insist, it's really impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:45 I'd suggest making the small turrets rockets though, and making simple CIWS contraptions instead for the guns
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:50:50 Or at least one CIWS
creations-chat 2018-12-01 00:51:28 Dunno, but if you do it I'll be thoroughly impressed
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:52:50 They can, but it'll occupy alot of their space
bug-reports 2018-12-01 00:54:06 Probably RGB color saving
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:03 Go to <#491710474786832394> for that stuff, and no, it's hard-coded, meaning it can't be changed
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:32 It was never meant to be changed, ever
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:01:47 The fact that Rick did what he did already was amazing
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:02:14 It was a fun little side project of Mad's that was never supposed to become what it is today, but here we are after a ton of rick's magic and wizardry
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:15 Data limit's hard coded, not on our side either
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:04:19 Roblox's limit
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:05:59 The limit's sometimes inaccurate
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:06:28 Give yourself a berth of around 5K blocks, go safe with 4K if you're using very complex creations
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:08:21 I know it's the incorrect spot Rick, but if I may ask, when's the gimballing parts coming out? It's literally the final step for my last project for a while
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:08:38 It does, and it's pretty nice
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:08:47 Even a rough estimate would help
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:10:29 Sorta like how the F-35's engine can rotate, except in this case, it's within a certain cone style angle
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:11:03 I say gimballing rather than vectorization because I realized if that kind of block is added, it could be applied for various parts as well
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:12:26 Alright then, to the VIP server?
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:12:44 We're going Empire's
creations-chat 2018-12-01 01:17:04 Or, nevermind, I'll try to find you in the PVP servers Linh
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:17:57 I mean like a dual axis engine, not just a single axis one
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:18:06 Because to get what I'm going for, I'd need 2 motors
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:19:30 Also, whoah my MK3 wobbles alot more
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:28:50 Right, genuine bug, my fighter wobbles alot more than it did before, practically swinging around a full 180 degree hemisphere if I try using both pitch and yaw to turn
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:36:39 My fighter? The landing gear
bug-reports 2018-12-01 01:37:11 I know T_Crash, go with a model bridge I suppose, it's less laggy, I was answering rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 19:04:46 He's already gotten the update ready, he's just waiting for Mad to update it
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 20:16:52 Teal, quit trying to start fights
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 20:17:08 Then don't be rude to alvin and DontShoot
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 20:17:21 You got Escape velocity already, now can ya please be quiet?
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 20:17:29 Thank you
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:47:29 **WHERE!?**
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:47:41 I heard gimballing testing and I want in badly
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:48:25 Phoenix! Where the hell is the gimballing!? I need it badly for my fighter
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:48:36 And no I'm not gonna ping him, that'd probably be very inconsiderate
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:48:41 Wait wait wait what the hell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:51:29 Just, doing other things
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:51:41 Also, don't worry about Deception, I'll deal with him
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:56:06 Deception, ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:56:15 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/518604347198668800/image0.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:56:18 Explain
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:56:58 If you couldn't tell by the way I'm in a lighter mood, considering Deception hasn't been broken yet
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 01:57:50 As insane as it sounds he's not the worst recently
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:00:35 I need gimballing for my guns and engines, once I get those though, I can do awesome stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:05:17 Hey, leave him be, it's just a joke, if Orange is fine with it then I'm probably fine with it, otherwise follow Orange's lead
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:05:46 Welp, alright, go for whatever Orange
bug-reports 2018-12-02 02:12:49 Easter egg, despawn and respawn to fix it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:13:42 I feel like we need a message for the easter egg at this point, everyone's asking about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:15:57 Post the picture and it's respective save slot in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:16:04 The save slot is only if you want ranks for it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:20:59 Well, it's on a motor, what do you think?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 02:21:30 Check <#473249376223887371> to see what you need
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:59:23 Oh come on, no gimballing/vector motors?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:41:11 Oy, don't think we didn't see that
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:41:18 Deception, next time don't be an idiot, can you show proof it was him?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:41:29 And DM it to us
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:41:38 Don't blap it out to the entire server for crap's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:42:18 You know my DMs are open, right Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:43:47 By technicalities they are within our responsibilities
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:44:02 Reason: You can only DM people you've friended or that are within the same server that you are, who haven't blocked you
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:44:14 Give me a moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:44:41 Got it, give me a moment Malicious
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:46:06 Riiiight then, <@352928457358835715> , here, have this as per protocol
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:47:27 Imperial, pins
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:48:42 Oy, can we cut it out guys?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:49:16 __***MAYBE ADD ANOTHER WARN HMMM!?***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:49:27 But seriously, this is a Roblox Discord, incase you haven't forgotten
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:50:12 Here's my answer

http://www.pregamemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-28-at-7.27.24-PM-800x450.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:52:26 Next time, think about the average audience we're bringing in
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:53:46 I'm cutting a ton of slack for Deception incase you haven't noticed, and we've cut slack for him before
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:55:29 Kave, you can request ranks to try to expedite it, but if nothing comes you can try resurfacing it, if nothing happens feel free to DM me
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:56:07 Done, enjoy everything being awesome
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:25 Don't leave the server first things first
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:47 Find a save slot or save the object, then try overwriting redundant save slots with empty stuff
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:56:57 Example: "5K boeing that you never use", overwrite it with literally a blank plot
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:06 If that can't crank it down, disable RGB color saving on certain creations
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:28 It's custom color saving
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:57:37 Check the little cog right above the save icon
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:14 Be sure to re-save, otherwise it won't have effect
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:18 But don't be surprised if the paint's vastly off
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:58:49 Alright, I'd suggest keeping it enabled for creations you value the most
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:06 Wait, you can't?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:21 Huh, then try overriding some redundant save slots
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:32 That's the little cog icon, I wasn't sure if he knew what the settings menu was
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 04:59:57 Phantom, it's sorta it's own thing actually
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:00:25 Whatever Floats Your Boat, except no money cost, aerodynamics engine, customizable controls and alot of parts
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:00:32 Yeah
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:02 Be warned: Any creation saved with RGB color saving off/false will have it's colors default to Roblox's core palette
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:14 So your creation might be painted pink, then come out eye-vomit yellow
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:01:22 Probably because you're too close to the save limit
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:02:01 I used to own an invincible tower on WFYB, then I quit after the creator added pay to win crap
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:02:36 Like seriously, I see level 1s scootering around in these over the top, ada-invi-unobtainium boxes just shooting everyone
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:02:52 Hmmm, let's see
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:03:11 That's a bug I'm unsure of gamesa, ask Rick about it, but if I had to guess, it had a checkmark over it, correct?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:03:33 Considering last time I saw there's parts that required like 4K levels for it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:03:35 Yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:04:01 Save it, delete it all, save that empty plot ontop of a build you haven't used
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:04:32 One example would be after an update in the long past broke motors (they lagged, ALOT), I deleted most of my jet style crafts, because they were all variants of one that used motors to adjust the tail fins
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:05:31 Use more control surfaces and space them out farther from the center of mass
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:05:52 Using this as a demonstration
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:06:28 The roll control surfaces are on the VERY tips of the wings for this creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:06:49 WFYB is Whatever Floats Your Boat
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:06:57 And it went the way of the EA
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:29 Pitch and yaw don't matter, place them wherever, but roll does, you need it as far from the center as possible
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:36 So place pitch and yaw on the inside, roll on the outside
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:07:47 Also engines would help
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:07:56 Still here, uhhhh, hmmm
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:08:30 You might, MIGHT be good, make sure to double/tripple save your creation in the same slot, then see if it saved
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:08:40 If not, talk to Rick about it, that's all the ways I know of how to fix it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:08:56 Well, if we're talking about control engines
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:09:39 Pitch engines should be near the nose and rear of the craft
Yaw engines should be, again, near the nose and rear, but if you want them facing forwards and backwards, as far to the left and right as possible
Roll should be as far from the center as possible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:10:12 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:10:28 Imperial, are you going to make a joke about EVERYTHING I type?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:10:41 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/518654425246728193/image0.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:10:47 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:10:54 Wait, bad example
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:11:14 
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:11:28 My freaking __**EYES**__ <@!128600291590275072> , SERIOUSLY
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:11:42 GOD DAMN EPILEPSY WARNING FOR FUCK'S SAKE, ow
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:12:25 Control surfaces work at higher speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-02 05:12:44 Hence why my fighter, which uses a fusion of engine assistance and control surfaces, maintains a high degree of maneuverability at high velocities
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:14:34 Well, if you leave the server, it should save properly
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:14:39 If not, again, don't blame me, I did all I could
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:16:51 Uhhhh, yeah you're over the save limit by the way
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:17:04 Follow what I went over with rbk, scroll up if you wanna see
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:19:57 Because you're saving a blank block normally, it doesn't care about what color it has, only that it's a block, and it winds up auto-painting the block
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:20:07 But when you place this down, it has to remember what color you painted it
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:20:13 Plus these blocks affect alot of stuff
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:28:04 Wait, different colors, huh
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:30:47 Seems like a bug, try jumping back and forth between the same colors
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:37:19 Huh, very interesting, so you can basically black out a redundant creation to preserve it, or white it out in order to test if you're within safety margins
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:40:35 Nah, it's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 05:49:15 Direct Message, not public chat
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:07:36 Does the opposite happen if you pull up, or is it even faster?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:08:04 If it's the former, your control surfaces bugged, replace them, if it's the latter, you have too much lift near the front, add some to the back (which is easy to be honest)
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:08:54 Alvin, just try what I suggested for a moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:09:24 ... No offense, but "best" and "small plane" don't really go together
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:09:51 But anyways, just debug it for us, that way we can fix it or find out if it's truly a bug
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:10:18 Try pulling up and pulling down, if you've got opposite controls, detach and reattach control surfaces, if it boosts your controls, you've got too much lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:12:39 Wait, in-game moderation's finished?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:12:50 Dang it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:13:58 Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:14:12 You used a pilot seat and not the main pilot seat?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:15:22 Pretty cool Lazer
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:19:33 We've got a troll that's harassing people in the server and we're thinking about how to deal with him
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:20:44 Slightly deviating Lazer?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:21:14 Do it fonkl, we don't need cancerous little craps on here, also the seat slightly imbalances you
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:22:00 Kip, trust me, they come back like 50 billion times, it's not worth it the first time, but by the second, third, fourth, etc, we'll be begging to ban him
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:26:09 Whitelisting's planned, but it's complicated, so don't expect it for a while
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:26:56 He found a bug yesterday where if you paint the same block over and over, it occupies more and more space, until finally you can make a single block occupy the entire ~260K data you've got
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:19 It's impossible to increase the save data size, and I'm very sure he's optimized it the best he could already
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:32:50 I suggested it to him already
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:37:21 Yeah, that's the catch I mentioned last time
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:37:34 It saves per Roblox's own color palette, not custom RGB colors
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 14:37:44 Whatever you need to get it working's fine
help 2018-12-02 21:04:47 Half blocks have collisions as if they were whole blocks sadly
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 21:08:24 Easter egg
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 21:55:41 I'd like to reserve an office space Imperial, next weekend I'll probably work on the final product to make it official
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 21:56:56 Any specifics on the new items?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:31:17 It's implied at the same time
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:31:44 Dude, can you cut it out for a bit? Seriously, you're flooding up <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:32:17 It either has to be an absurd payload, like with my over 100 block's worth of weight bomb, or it has to be a bunch of bombs
help 2018-12-02 23:33:31 If a spawn killer is an issue, no offense, but you have a bad build, and not only that, you have different spawn points, such as the airport and the water
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:59 Someone made a cube and called it a creation, just a literal cube that was somehow forced to fly with an excess of wings and engines pointing straight upwards
help 2018-12-02 23:34:43 Right, I've made a tank that's extremely durable, fast and stable, and if you don't know how to make a plane after going over the tutorial and <#501034677793193994> , then sorry, but no amount of help will help you
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:03 Spoilers, nobody considered it a creation, they have to have at least some bit of meaning
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:17 That would actually be a creation for sure
help 2018-12-02 23:35:54 Check to see if any blocks are really high or are colliding with the top box, if not, you might've caught something under the floor
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:12 ... Dude
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:41 I am not an idiot, I am fully aware of what's a creation and what's a replica, a simple cube isn't a creation, it's just simply placing blocks in an arranged pattern
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:45 Also that isn't even your boeing
help 2018-12-02 23:37:06 RIP, sorry Tommy
help 2018-12-02 23:37:22 Don't use always on/off thrusters and they'll maintain their thrust
help 2018-12-02 23:37:50 Also, <@318892614378061824> , again, look over the tutorial and <#501034677793193994> , if you can't figure it out with the detailed instructions there, then no amount of attempts to help you will be able to help you
help 2018-12-02 23:38:24 Yeahhh, no idea, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:04 It's uncreative as hell, but it's a creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:24 Flame, he means his planes, not the missiles
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:45 You want creativity? A creation?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:08 This, this is a creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:43 It's a fighter designed for absolute optimal performance, and it definitely shows
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:41:31 It doesn't spin, it rips other fighters out of the air
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:42:55 Even if I demonstrate it, 1: You'll probably doubt it
2: Anyone could tell just from it's design
3: If you ask around the server, you'll know that this thing's quite the terror
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:43:24 Like actually guides it's self towards you, or do you mean missiles home in?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:15 You are, entirely wrong, did you not even bother to check the screwdriver tool, which was went over in the tutorial?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:25 At least, I believe it was, I haven't tried it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:44:59 Like the ones on the heli in the gif, or are they custom built missiles?
help 2018-12-02 23:45:33 You might be out of luck on those blocks, but I'd say a specific type of triangular wedge would be needed
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:46:06 Those are normal, he just added cameras to the nose of those rockets so he could fly them into you
help 2018-12-02 23:46:59 I don't think we have that particular wedge yet to be honest
help 2018-12-02 23:47:16 It's sort of a cube with a triangular wedge taken out of it
help 2018-12-02 23:47:25 Put that in suggestions if you want it
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:48:13 Yes, exactly, he's probably got some form of control in each missile, and placed a rocket on the nose of each one, so when it hits something, he shoots the rocket out and it winds up detonating
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:48:35 Think of it as controlling a plane, except you're doing it via cameras
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:49:26 John, learn the advanced mechanics of the game either via experimentation or asking people around in your server before you start judging other people's creations
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:24 You've got John in your username, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:58:33 Not yet anyways
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:11:26 Not bad, want any ranks for it?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:13:23 Check <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:13:30 And if you'd please, show a save slot
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:14:58 Done Nem
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:15:39 Oh, right
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:15:46 Done
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:16:48 How many blocks?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:18:40 Done
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:19:54 I'll need to check, but I'm willing to bet they're like rope and suspension fused together
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:20:29 We'll check, you might have it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:21:25 We've seen mechs and walkers of many sorts before, but we'll double check that particular mechanism
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:22:55 Hey, it looks pretty nice!
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:25:17 Care to show a video of it then?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:26:04 Mmmmm, just try to get a video if you could, it's a bit easier for us
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:29:39 Looks like a stealth warship
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:27 Well, ehhhh, it's a bit, vague, specifically the landkreuzer
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:32 Let me check
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:31:39 Wait no nevermind
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:32:53 Missing a front gun, as well as some smaller turrets, but you did get the primary mechanisms correct
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:33:08 Ehhhhh, I'll give it to the other mods, also hold on, let me show the others that
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:33:41 Looks very bulky
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:35 I don't mean the front turret, I mean the front gun, sorta like the one on the M3 Lee
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:34:47 Wait no nevermind again
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:35:02 Ehhhh, one more picture, this one of the front, and if the gun's there I'll give it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:36:07 Pretty cool, we're going over it now
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:36:53 You need more upvotes Smokey
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:37:00 Not sure
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:37:20 First of all, more and wider wedges would be a good start
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:05 Hey <@!255361087262818304> , hey, guess what?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:15 Guess
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:49:24 Not a problem
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:55:58 Erhm, try it again?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:56:09 Gonna take off for a while, seeya guys
general 2018-12-03 03:37:48 OY! Freaking rule 2
general 2018-12-03 03:38:11 Wrong person Empire
general 2018-12-03 03:38:16 JOHN!
general 2018-12-03 03:38:22 !mute <@!514983224192008213>
general 2018-12-03 03:38:24 Fuck
general 2018-12-03 03:49:16 We're good!
general 2018-12-03 03:58:11 Alright, clear it up guys, it's just here so we're all informed about what's bad
general 2018-12-03 03:58:39 They try to be edgy, but they don't realize they've just sliced themselves up with their edginess
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:27:56 I'm having issues! Motors aren't resetting!
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:28:19 I need motors to reset back to their position in an organized fashion, otherwise chaos happens
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:35:27 Well, it's part of the final project
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:35:39 I'll show you one hint
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:36:02 That's the only spoiler you're getting
bug-reports 2018-12-03 04:37:00 But motors don't work, I set them to speed 3, Y and H as the rotation keys (This thing's gonna be a nightmare to fly), and when I let go, they don't automatically rotate back to place
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:44:47 <@!333101356489637890> OY!
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:45:04 Quit picking on everyone, alright? What the actual hell did any of them do to you?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:23 Empire, er, no offense but he sorta just did
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:32 And admittedly Jail is technically underqualified
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:37 But at the same t- ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:44 __**EMPIRE, NYTE, BOTH OF YOU CUT IT OUT**__
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:50 Right, let me try resolving this
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:47:42 Admittedly Jail did get through without the technical qualifications, however, the decision is still ours in the end, and reading over his submission, Xpert, who's usually very stingy about this stuff, agreed
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:48:27 Nyte, let me guess the problem, you wanted to be a mod, yet it didn't happen
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:48:46 Then what exactly is the problem?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:49:42 Then be patient, we all have our lives outside of this stuff, what you're describing is a bot
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:50:19 Again, the finalized decision's up to us
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:50:47 Nyte, for crap's sake, don't do a Dragon ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:51:10 If you don't like the server, nobody's forcing you to stay here, you won't get punished in the actual game if you leave the server unless you threw the mother of all shitstorms in here
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:51:40 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:52:13 Nyte, you're acting like a troll, and quite frankly, no server in their right minds would hire a fucker like you if you keep it up, so want my suggestion? **CUT THE CRAP AND QUIT ACTING PRIVILEGED**
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:52:34 Quite frankly I'm one of the ones that had to earn it, and instead of throwing a crying temper tantrum the first time it didn't happen I just acted kindly until it happened
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:53:42 Empire, Nuclear, you two weren't exactly helping to be perfectly honest ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:53:59 Just, let me type out one thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:56:32 What's the account name?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:57:56 I'm not sure if we can, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 07:00:56 <@461111372239994881> , it's hard-coded, it was never meant to be expanded upon
help 2018-12-03 22:50:37 Check the center of lift is my first guess <@318892614378061824>
creations-chat 2018-12-03 22:51:32 Not bad for a 5 minute build
help 2018-12-03 22:52:11 Does it dive down or pull up or what?
help 2018-12-03 22:52:43 Center of thrust is too high, add more engines to the underside
help 2018-12-03 22:53:12 Your center of thrust is high, adding a force that's making it pitch downwards
help 2018-12-03 22:55:30 Then tweak it, the center of thrust is too low now
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:13:48 Dude, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:14:06 Aero, just, seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:14:41 Then please don't share them with us unless they're fine
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:15:36 If it breaks Rule 2 I'm going to break your face (in the server sense, aka: A huge mute), got it?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:16:38 ... Disturbing, but it doesn't break the rule
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:18:47 Okay can you cut it out with the disgusting/disturbing crud? It's freaking me out a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:19:49 You know you can have NSFW stuff on your phone and it's still "on your phone", right? That's not exactly an excuse ...
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:22:06 Not Safe For Work, in other words, anything that's inappropriate
creations-chat 2018-12-04 00:26:26 It's for item size, also, dang, nice job lili, any engines in the blimp?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:05:05 So quite literally it's a tank that transforms into a jet?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 01:05:32 Why am I not surprised at this point Ignacioel
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:06:00 Seriously? Like, are you serious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:06:04 You're fine kave, but seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:07:49 Looks not half bad, although freaking unstable definitely
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:10:33 Daaaamn, nice, you need the upvotes though
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:10:46 Oh wait
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:18:58 Tiny, but not bad
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:20:38 Make your own plane
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:21:41 Just force it to daytime
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:21:44 Click the cog, aka: Settings
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:23:09 Not half bad to be honest! Makes me think of a Rebel Snowspeeder
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:23:35 Try making another one
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:26:49 <@!336263560533377047> , can you please use Streamable or some video to gif converter for convenience? It gets annoying, and it's highly unsafe downloading .wmv files
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:06 I should know, considering I've been on the receiving end of an attempted virus hidden as a .wmv before
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:22 Just find something
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:29 Anything will do
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:27:40 Just no .wmv files
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:29:10 I LOVE shooting down those tutorial VTOLs, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:29:20 They're such easy targets, not combat-viable in the slightest
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:29:36 Huge target profile, not fast, not maneuverable, not alot of guns, and practically no armor
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:29:57 Nah, they're seriously annoying to shoot potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:30:16 The tutorial VTOLs are easy, tiny starter planes? Not easy in the slightest
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:30:32 Hence why I suggested scatterguns, infact, let me do a mass suggestion of weapons
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:31:43 Hey guess what? Look at your ranks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:34:55 There we go, vote on my suggestions in <#507673335816126509> if you want
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:35:03 Also, ballasts are weighted blocks that are heavier or lighter based on density
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:35:44 A single ballast won't out-weigh anything unless you've got a ton of stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:35:46 Also, they have
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:35:56 Kratos, use CTRL+F and type in "Friction" in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:36:21 If what you suggested pops up, and it's been a long while (2+ weeks since it last was mentioned from today), you may re-surface it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:36:33 Otherwise I'd suggest you just give it an upvote
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:37:02 The apocalypse is happening or something?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:37:28 "HAD" not "HAVE"
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:37:32 Had is past tense, have is present tense
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:37:58 It's not grammar naziism unless I go over every single thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:38:59 I don't punctuate to be fully honest, most people assume you have a period at the end of your sentence when typing in a chat online
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:39:20 If I punctuate, **LIKE THIS** __**!!!**__, then it's to emphasize something
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:47:27 Terraria reference?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:49:48 Give me a moment
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:50:17 Submit the save slot if you want ranks, also check over <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:52:12 That's pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:52:22 If you want ranks for it, check <#473249376223887371> and post the save slot
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:54:38 It's confirmed, but note: It'll probably take A GOD EFFING LONG WHILE
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:54:54 Land/surface based creations are sadly doubled, so you got Expert
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:55:30 <@456226577798135808> , Rick's the only guy working on the game, cut him some slack!
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:55:49 Oh, right
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:56:16 <@458451488335986688> , it'd probably stay at it's current amount, as 3 per plot would have, complications
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 02:56:40 Trust me, Mad made some special little code that Rick somehow decoded with his wizardry
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:57:16 Ops, did someone give you master builder? I wonder who did that? (You're only 4 blocks away, may as well, also that was sarcasm by the way)
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:00:40 Yeah?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:00:52 Ahem, pay attention to your stuff
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:02:36 <@456226577798135808> ! Think you can cram a potential hiree somewhere?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:03:35 Hey, it's a very distinct craft
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:03:41 Why don't you try breaking it up?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:03:49 Sadly no Sub
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:03:55 Happened, ALOT
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:04:14 Still nada, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:04:26 Make a non-Osprey VTOL
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:04:47 Ignacioel's actually right
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:05:09 If we had more gold, he'd have another trophy, but he literally drained us dry out of it making Inventor trophies for him
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:07:13 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/508046048317669377/cc1d27b485a4116b4b81c362eca89cd3.png
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:07:13 Crab truck with working arms from Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:07:48 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/507390031783264287/d1b249df9831e0e62ba93c2bd5b99c96.png
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:07:48 Modular vehicle creating, again, from Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:07:50 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/507390100749942786/cb42b0ff484213e44f78e3ff1b4a6e78.png
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:13 I expect it to barf out at least 10 notes
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:24 And even then that might be modeler
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:49 Already been done, it wasn't effective
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:08:53 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:03 Next Inventor trophy's gotta be made outa silver thanks to Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:25 Tank, if Sub can make a working calculator that actually calculates out the correct numbers, with at least basic + or -, then that'd probably be inventor
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:09:55 Let me guess, more actual value Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:04 SUB! REMEMBER, it must calculate correct numbers
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:22 It can't have a pre-determined set, it must calculate the correct values
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:10:39 So if I do 9 + 9, it should give out 18
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:11:05 Then sorry but n- FFS IGNACIOEL
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:11:40 Remember, being good at everything doesn't mean it's the best
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:11:50 There may be more specialized vehicles that do a better job
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:18 Then write down the idea to someone
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:26 I've already got inventor, so don't worry about me stealing it
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:12:48 Sounds good
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:13:30 It's gotta have some theme, like mine's high performance military tech
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:13:54 Hey, you could file under my company name ya know
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:14:28 Basically you're co-creator for our company
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:15:22 Well, you get funding you can dump on trophies (not actual funding by the way)
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:15:45 Alright
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:17 Not with one button
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:24 It needs to calculate out various equations
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:16:36 Such as 9+9, or 4+1, and so on
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:18:35 Sub, don't give others ideas!
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:18:38 Someone might steal it from you
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:20:29 If they do, we can't stop them if they execute it first
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:21:31 Oy, I came up with the trapper tank first Imperial
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:21:38 I tried using it to capture a troll
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:21:52 This was on the push tank (RIP that thing sadly)
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:22:22 Not if you box them in
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:24:55 Well, it's unique and distinct, so sure
creations-chat 2018-12-04 03:25:19 Key points: Unique, and DISTINCT, it must be very visible and obvious that it's yours, to the point where all who try to copy it fail
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:27:56 There is none
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:28:27 Should've gone "Take this to the #nsfw-channel please, out the door"
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:37:26 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:37:53 Wait what was the command? FFS, it changed
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:38:05 Have this temporary mute on your face while I find the bot mute
help 2018-12-04 03:41:12 You can paint all sides on it
help 2018-12-04 03:41:16 Individually
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:41:50 Maybe in a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:42:39 OH! I'm not spoiling this one, but I know what he did
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:42:58 🐲🤐
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:43:05 Wait wait wait wait what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:43:09 Discord has those!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:43:26 I used your little thing potatoe, and that happened
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:46:17 Everyone builds their own ways, and they slowly evolve their own styles <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:46:25 So don't worry, keep on building
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:55:57 It's mahina, not machina
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:59:18 A bomb with cluster bombs?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:00:13 I wonder if my crafts can carry it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:01:01 "He's the guy with the invincible "oh my god" carriers"?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:06:07 It's manual steering using engines to rotate your craft
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:06:16 It's what I use for many of my high performance crafts at low speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:07:09 Oy, Flame, I use it on my crafts and they perform amazingly, the thing is they compensate for a lack of control at low speeds
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:09:51 Too close proximity to eachother
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:11:03 The half blocks at the base
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:11:49 It's sticking the cluster together
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:14:02 Er, wait, nevermind, it's probably the cylinders
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:14:38 Wait, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:14:39 OH!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:14:42 The half blocks near the tail
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:14:55 God DAMN that's a nice Sopwith!
creations-chat 2018-12-04 04:15:11 Could use some actual propellers near the nose, but damn it's nice!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:21:46 Turn PVP mode on
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:27:12 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:37:32 Now add one more layer of clustering Deception
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:40:36 Now fit that on one of my fighters
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:42:57 Did you forget how much weight these things can lift?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:43:21 For reference, here's the MK1, weakest of the bunch, with the max payload it could possibly carry at the time
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:43:28 Those are max weight ballasts by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:44:38 Look at the payload to body ratio on that thing and tell me it can't lift that bomb of yours
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 04:50:29 Not sure, the only comparison (Which was an old one), was 1 max weight ballast was equal to 1 block back in the day, back with 2 density as the max
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:07:28 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:07:40 You're gonna add more?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:07:59 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:30:16 Any flying vehicle's probably a car and a boat as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:30:24 Although damn that design looks nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:33:22 Control surfaces work better at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:34:55 RIP Kiwi
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:35:01 Also, either that or use engines to assist the turn
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:35:05 Also, use triangle wedges on the nose!
bug-reports 2018-12-04 05:38:17 Explain? ._.
bug-reports 2018-12-04 05:40:04 Ah, that's general motor crud I believe
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:42:20 Which is? The cockpit?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:42:37 Meh, easy to copy, but it's a really nice add-on to most creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:44:43 Motors broke it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:49:45 Control surfaces tend to work better at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:50:10 That's one problem we had with the original supersonic idea, crafts had to be controllable, but control surfaces were too sensitive, engines were too weak, and so on
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:54:05 Oy, no bringing it to those kinds of jokes
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 05:55:06 Seeya
creations-chat 2018-12-05 05:00:54 Dude, when you post stuff, ti affects <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2018-12-05 05:01:10 I cleaned it up for ya, but keep an eye on it if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-05 05:04:17 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:46:47 Sadly no, it's hard-coded
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:46:57 Although Rick may work on it, eventually
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:48:55 It was never meant to be modified, ever
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:49:14 Follow what others did and you'll get a color
creations-chat 2018-12-05 06:49:19 Not bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:49:29 Check <#519624169730605086>
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 06:53:51 Something you sadly can't get, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 15:16:55 Check <#519624169730605086>
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 15:17:46 Tada, you have a colored name
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:18:32 This is a server directly linked to the game, so punishments here do matter
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:19:16 There, now you have no other choice but to leave, also, oy <@456226577798135808> , no insults like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:21:15 Because it's not a racial slur, we literally had a conversation in our dorm floor about that crap
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:22:16 ... <@456226577798135808> , you did it in-game, and in-game is linked to this server by technicalities, hell, THE Madattak who (technically) owns the game is here
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:22:42 He gets verbal warned for verbal annoyance, plus I'm a bit more lenient, although not to racial slurs
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:23:12 You will be stunned at how many bullets get used due to racial bullshit, so cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:23:48 You know what, screw it, I'm shutting this guy down
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:23:59 Direct complaints through me and I'll filter them out
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:06 <@456226577798135808> , DON'T EGG IT ON!
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:32 Seriously, next one and I'm whacking you with a home run
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:33 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:35 Wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:38 Seriously rick?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:45 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:24:52 That, would've been, nice to know
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:25:03 Still, don't give him TOO much leeway, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:25:28 ... Look at me with that, okay maybe I should actually focus on one thing at a time
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 21:26:02 Anyways, I'm out, seeya
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:02:45 Attach them similar to a motor, then when you press the key, the decoupler will separate
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:04:00 ... Aero, I don't take petty requests like that, not to mention it's their opinion
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:04:45 Show me proof that someone wronged you in a way that breaks the rules and I'll talk to the others about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:05:14 Then show me proof of this somehow, a screenshot preferably
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:07:04 No more disturbing photos, I think we've had far, far more enough of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:07:40 <@!362351190618538005> , they do that because it's considered spam, and quite frankly it is spam, except in a specific set of scenarios, so in short, assume it's just spam
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:09:05 Aero, can you please not? Seriously, take it to <#495286269459300364> , and if it's going to far we'll shut it down
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:12:19 Dude ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:12:28 Not you van
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:14:54 __**FUCK NO**__
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:15:03 Read <#512414682552729601>
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:15:09 Very, very thoroughly
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:15:45 Or have common sense, and realize this is a server for a Roblox game, so we have to abide by Roblox rules
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:15:55 **AND DIDN'T I ALREADY TELL  YOU NSFW STUFF WAS NOT ALLOWED!?**
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:17:11 Yes yes you can be staff for whatever the hell you want, this isn't Terraria, this is Roblox, advertised primarily to kids
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:17:43 Just cut it out ...
the-dump 2018-12-06 00:17:54 If you try to push the argument we will shut it down
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:22:38 Pffff, not bad actually
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:29:00 !changelog
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:29:03 Tadaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:29:16 Anyways, <@!343480913604116480> , you have a wing tip gripping onto it
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:30:30 Just go off the principle of "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 03:44:31 What?
creations-chat 2018-12-06 06:15:14 Gonna need more payload than that
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:22:59 Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:23:06 Guys just, seriously? ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:24:49 Just, what the hell's different between what you're describing and a regular dogfight? Seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:27:15 Dragon, it's nowhere near on-topic, it's another game alltogether
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:27:22 Just because planes are in it doesn't mean it's on-topic
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:27:50 Also, <@!343480913604116480> , do you want to get banned? That stuff's worse than a minefield when it comes to controversy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:27:55 <@!264591184863690752> , use trap doors
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:29:01 ... Dragon, shut it, that is <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , just because it has a PLANE in it, doesn't mean it's MADE IN PLANE CRAZY
general 2018-12-07 03:29:39 Dragon was trying to turn <#384021699466756107> into a Fortnite discussion, which is off topic
general 2018-12-07 03:29:51 And he kept on insisting it was on topic, so we had to shut it down, so he didn't spam it to hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:30:47 If anyone needs to be banned it's you Dragon, now for fuck's sake, can you please quit giving us all headaches every time you appear?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:31:12 I swear I'm not even kidding when I say that nowadays, whenever I see you appear Dragon, my head hurts
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:31:23 OY! POINT!
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:32:25 Oh there you fucking go, throwing more shit at me again Dragon, always "James needs to be banned" "James is a a bully" "James is oppressive" "James" THIS, "JAMES" THAT, HOW ABOUT **FUCK YOU** __**YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHIT!?**__ __***NOW LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE!***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:32:49 <@!343480913604116480> , it's, a, long, long, long story
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:33:00 One I'd rather not go over ... please, just don't make me go over it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:33:41 Right, back to (at least pretending) to be happy, go for it Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:34:21 It's not off-topic if you're talking about making it, as long as you don't just shove it off for later continuously
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:34:58 Example: Talking about Star-Wars is off-topic, but talking about making an X-wing is on-topic, making an Enterprise is on-topic, but talking generally about Star Trek is off-topic
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:35:35 I'd say no, unless you scale it up Point
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:35:49 Like, make it larger
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:36:06 Otherwise you're probably outa luck for more detail, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:36:19 Flame, upscaling allows you to cram in more detail for more accuracy
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 03:36:24 Even if it's not accurate to the body ratio
creations-chat 2018-12-07 03:52:17 That's, not exactly new, or the first, or the smallest
creations-chat 2018-12-07 03:52:58 Alright
help 2018-12-07 04:03:26 Simply put for safety reasons we can't download any .wmv videos, so sory, but unless it's doing it within the text, no
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:45:48 How is it confusing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:46:20 Well, describe it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:46:35 It's 11:46PM, of course it's dead
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:49:02 By good, what do you mean exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:51:13 Well, considering this is a Roblox server, it's almost stunningly good, otherwise, meh, it's middling/high on how good it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:52:21 I'm not in Asia, the hell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:52:46 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:56:19 Swiss, if you can think up of it, it's probably already been made
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:56:27 That's a very good rule of thumb
help 2018-12-07 04:56:51 Control surfaces work better at higher thrust from what I remember, or you can use rotated engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 04:57:19 Guys ... someone already made a concord that was able to do everything a concord was able to do
help 2018-12-07 05:07:04 Yes
help 2018-12-07 05:10:43 Sorta Derpy, you can use that, or you can use hard-locked engines
help 2018-12-07 05:10:49 You need roll
help 2018-12-07 05:11:01 Like, control surfaces need to alternate, or you need rotational engines
help 2018-12-07 05:11:28 Good demonstration: This craft has pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) and roll (clock/counter)
help 2018-12-07 05:11:54 Control surfaces work to Tornado
help 2018-12-07 05:12:03 Everything on the right has to go up, and everything on the left has to go down
help 2018-12-07 05:12:30 That's the point of roll
help 2018-12-07 05:12:47 Tha- Tornado, <@!251995895405477888> , that's literally the **ENTIRE POINT** of roll
help 2018-12-07 05:13:09 To tilt one side of your craft until you reach your desired clockwise/counterclockwise angle
help 2018-12-07 05:13:18 Then what do you mean by roll?
help 2018-12-07 05:13:25 Hold on, let me get a picture
help 2018-12-07 05:14:21 Point out which one you mean!
help 2018-12-07 05:14:22 http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/yaw/controls.jpg
help 2018-12-07 05:14:42 Is it upper left, lower left, or right?
help 2018-12-07 05:15:25 <@!251995895405477888> , Which one is it, upper left, lower left, or lower right!?
help 2018-12-07 05:15:29 Or is it none of those!?
help 2018-12-07 05:15:42 http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/yaw/controls.jpg
help 2018-12-07 05:16:07 ... Tornado, if you're just trolling us
help 2018-12-07 05:16:34 It __**WILL, BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF SOME CRAFTS, PLUS IT'S SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT ANYONE WHO BUILDS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FLYING BOX WON'T CARE**__
help 2018-12-07 05:17:26 ... Joey, next time if you want help with something, answer other people's questions so we know exactly what the problem is
help 2018-12-07 05:17:48 You were asking how to make something roll
help 2018-12-07 05:18:21 TA, FREAKING, DA
help 2018-12-07 05:18:58 Tornado, next time go "Yes I know how to roll, but won't it yaw?", then we'll know to not talk about roll anymore, but whether roll will affect yaw
help 2018-12-07 05:19:21 In this case **YES**, it will turn it slightly to the direction you rolled in
help 2018-12-07 05:19:37 Swiss, if I didn't know at least the basics of aerodynamics, I wouldn't be able to debug these issues
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:20:00 Pfff, weaponized chair, nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:22:08 Let's see it in action? Also, yes <@!514837508627103745> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:22:48 The contest right now is VTOLs
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:22:58 Design a VTOL that gets the most upvotes and you win the contest and get a special little rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:23:12 Bay, mind showing us?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:23:23 You'll be credited as the first if anyone copies, since ya showed us
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:23:27 Check <#504718138399522832>
the-dump 2018-12-07 05:23:47 It's for barfing out general shit, basically anything that's, I suppose "meme-worthy"
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:23:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:24:00 Don't foncuse VTOL with STOL by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:24:29 And for the sake of making it not too easy, VTOLs have to take off while facing forward, and their primary momentum must be forward
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:26:26 Build a starfighter of some sort
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:27:50 Good luck
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:28:13 There's an in-game tutorial you know, and not all blocks are aerodynamically simulated
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:28:37 Also you're still gonna have issues, I can already see the center of lift is too far back, so you're gonna faceplant into the ground due to the lift dragging your rear into the air, and nose into the ground
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:28:59 There's so many ospreys that you won't get observed
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:29:12 And that's not the main issue, you can make it however you wish, whether it's 1 or infinite engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:29:20 The main issue is making it fly properly
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:29:25 It's ALOT harder than you might think
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:29:42 Example: This was a (Forgive my language) __**BITCH**__ to get flying
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:30:25 Add wing panels to the nose, use ballast blocks in the back, helium in the front, just do whatever you need in order to drag the center of mass back, or the center of lift forwards
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:32:12 Then submit a creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:32:26 If you want a color role, go to <#519624169730605086> and follow what others did on there
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:32:43 Check <#473249376223887371> then to determine what role you want
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:33:24 <#519624169730605086>
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:33:52 Nuclear, is this 1K creation not proof enough that I play!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:34:02 Or this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:34:18 OR FREAKING THIS!? (I'm already past this point by the way, just waiting for one last part)
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:34:38 Turret? You mean the giant gun on the left side?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:35:20 Current gameplay purposes: None
Aesthetic/lore/roleplay purposes: Twin weapon system, in this case autocannons
Future purposes: The BIGGEST GUN I CAN CRAM IN THERE
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:35:34 Take a guess why this thing maneuvers so well Nuclear
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:35:59 Instantly pung off into space?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:36:48 You probably have Tornado, it's called an uninflated one
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:40:07 You mean mine?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:40:35 I'm guessing fuel
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:40:45 Just try wikiing it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:45:10 Far, you probably want it balanced, it just has to meet the quota of a VTOL, which is to go straight up or down, but people will judge it's quality
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:45:21 It should be good now
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:45:38 Although you might wanna bump the engines down lower to be parallel with the center of mass, as if they're high, they'll push you down as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:46:32 __**FUCKING HELL**__, DRAGON, SHUT IT ALREADY
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:46:49 We already told you to can it with the Fortnite stuff or drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , YET YOU KEEP ON BLABBING ON!
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:47:08 <@520331741861380106> , use the screwdriver to set the keybind
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:47:25 Also, <@!314219571995344897> , just cut it out, you're gonna chase people away ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:47:57 <@520331741861380106> , you set a custom keybind
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:48:01 And you need to be in the seat to use it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:48:29 ... <@!314219571995344897> , just, shut up please before I (not actually) strangle you or something

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:50:53 Also, I'm sorry nuclear, it's just that Dragon, and everything about him, consistently pissed me off to high hell in the past, so anything related to him is, touchy, with me
help 2018-12-07 05:51:11 It'll be unstable for sure, but it might not be bad

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:55:23 Empire, how about I tell you to calm down after someone harasses you FOR MONTHS
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:55:43 And that one word is the one word I am very, very pissed off with
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:55:52 Ask Imperial, Orange, Potatoe, etc about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:56:19 Long story short, every single **FUCKING** time I came on in the past he'd call me bully for no **FUCKING** reason other than to bug me
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:56:46 Anyways, moving on
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 05:56:57 Stridel, it's called folding, check <#501034677793193994>
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:57:24 Wing panels don't connect on the top and bottom, only the sides
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:57:32 Replace the ones you want connecting with regular or half blocks
help 2018-12-07 05:57:55 More wings = more drag, more engines obviously
help 2018-12-07 05:58:08 And there's a little thing we like to call intertia in the science industry
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:58:17 How well does it perform?
help 2018-12-07 05:58:58 Yeup, in terms of building physics, we're kinda up there, but in terms of pure physics, there's probably other games that do it "better"
help 2018-12-07 05:59:08 Well, by building physics I mean building games' physics
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:01:44 Then make one that works like a genuine lock Dragon, with pins and such that require a key
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:02:01 Not half bad designs
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:02:37 I think he means a lock like a padlock, except he's just going to build it using one motor rather than the entire internal mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:02:43 Or, maybe two and a set of pistons
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:04:20 "Twisty locks"? The heck do you mean?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:04:39 It looks pretty nice to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:05:38 <@!251995895405477888> , anything can be scaled up easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:06:04 Oh wait, going off topic in general's a thing to warn?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:06:59 Guys, no freaking hostilities if you mind ...

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:08:49 Nuclear ... if I were to tell you the whole story, it'd take the entire month, so I'm just going to leave it at this: He's freaking hypocritical to hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:10:44 Dragon, can you type out something that makes more sense than zero?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:11:04 Cool <@520331741861380106>

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:14:56 It's one of those days and I don't feel like dealing with another fucking harassment squad
help 2018-12-07 06:15:15 Engines too high up maybe?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:16:14 It depends to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:16:32 Ah, then definitely too big
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:16:40 Then, what's it suppose to be?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:16:42 Ah

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:17:41 ... <@!403180643233693696> , I get enough general shit from Dragon, so if you want to keep pushing me, continue doing so, and suffer the consequences on your own pool of damn blood
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:19:07 Not half bad <@520331741861380106>
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:20:48 Hey, what's my supergiant fighter? Chopped liver?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:20:56 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:21:08 Yeah no that's definitely one of the larger ones you could make without folding
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:23:07 Tornado, it attracts all blocks, not just other magnets
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:23:25 Wait that's an option now? (I don't use magnets if you couldn't tell)
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:23:46 Huh, well it'd work the same as normal, just only on magnets
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:24:49 Tornado, don't think of it too hard to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:25:01 Just think of it as pushing and pulling a block no matter which direction
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:25:23 The red part has to face towards whatever you want to push/pull
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:25:29 But the other part doesn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:26:23 Empire, just leave it to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:26:49 Then fine! Explain it to him, see how you do, <@!251995895405477888> , listen to Empire because apparently he's right
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:32:00 Engines can have any amount of cylinders
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 06:32:10 Most modern car engines have either 4 or 6 pistons though
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:32:30 That's pretty nice

creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:06 Check to see if it remains level, basically lob it off the other edge
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:11 If it remains level, you're too freaking heavy, add more wings
creations-chat 2018-12-07 06:54:33 Lower the engines if that doesn't work, and add more frontal fins and control stuff
creations-chat 2018-12-07 07:40:16 Well, let's play it safe and say no
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 07:40:35 Blacklist him
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:36:34 You mean a lock system Dip? That's, probably already been made, also next time watch your language in the Plane Crazy chat
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:37:04 In-game
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:37:15 These things do boomerang around to bite you later down the line
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:38:00 Anyways, people have made doors, people have made lock systems, sadly neither are impressive or new

creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:43:49 <@456226577798135808> , just because it's big, doesn't mean it's good, as Totten will tell you
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:44:04 Yes it looks really nice, no it's not impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:44:22 What is is something that's big and can fly, because getting large things to fly is a pain and a half

creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:46:36 Ah crap, welp
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:46:47 If anyone can give someone inventor, it's Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:04 Ffff, fine, go for it Ignacioel
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:06 And that's not how it works
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:16 You post a picture, it's save slot, and to expedite stuff, you request it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:35 By the way, HE has to be the one to build it, and you can't just hold his hand all the way through
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:40 Marcus, post the save slot here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:51 <@456226577798135808> , **FUCK NO**, you have to post the save slot
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:47:56 ... Not what I meant
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:48:11 Post a picture of the save slot that you have saved it in
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:48:21 Check your ranks again ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:00 There we go, that works out Marcus, er, one last thing, mind showing us the username? I know, "Oh there's so many steps", it's to make sure you aren't mooching off of someone else's work
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:13 ... Not, what I meant
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:17 As in show us in the picture
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:24 Theeeere we go
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:49:43 Done, enjoy your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:50:03 Show us the ferry?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:50:19 Also, <@456226577798135808> , do you WANT to bug the admins and mods again? Seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:53:03 ... Dip, how the hell is it my fucking fault if you're the one who got yourself banned earlier, and can't even show the save slot currently? Now don't accuse me of blame that's yours, I get enough of that shit in real life to recognize it, and I've had enough of it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:53:18 Hold on <@!159321283165814784> , checking the ranks a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:54:06 Good rule of thumb SubZero: If you can think it up in under a month's worth of time, it's probably already been made
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:54:12 Also, ranks given Marcus
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 15:55:02 Then yoink one off the internet
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:57:46 Probably because I'm not an admin, and not only that, I actually bother enforcing the rules with the equivalent of a steel bat
creations-chat 2018-12-07 15:58:20 ... Okay the others do enforce the rules to, but to be honest I've been through alot in the server, don't ask, we'd be here all month
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 15:59:04 ... Be careful Kratos, you're a bit close to the edge there
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:00:30 MIB?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:01:03 Ah, that'd count for modeler probably, but at the same time Ignacioel beat you at mono-wheels
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:13:58 Interesting, it's nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:16:39 TIEs have been made before, but cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:26:26 That, is gonna be a pain to fight against, but you only need to land one hit to win
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:32:28 RIP, upscaling stuff allows for more detail
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:34:28 ... <@456226577798135808> , HEY!
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:35:46 <@456226577798135808> , And you whine about me being "annoying", THIS IS THE SECOND DAMN TIME YOU BOTHERED SOMEINE IN-GAME, AFTER I TOLD YOU TO CUT IT OUT, now quit being hypocritical or so help me I'll shove you where every other damn hypocritical little asshole goes, OUT THE DOOR AND INTO A TRASH COMPACTOR (Aka: Banned)
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:39:49 You've got bigger problems, <#384021699466756107> , now
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:40:32 Then I'll drag it over here, since you so blatantly refuse to come over here

creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:40:38 **EXPLAIN THIS**
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:41:40 I have, it's more impressive than what you can do, what the hell did I say about actions in-game will affect you in the Discord server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:42:38 I'd love to see an alternating walker, you know, not weird wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:43:27 ... <@!284945768564129793> , people can express what they want, can you please learn to just accept it? I mean, nobody complains about your pictures/ideas/icons, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:43:38 Pretty cool that
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:44:07 Jet engines have no intake physics, so they can be put anywhere
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:44:25 Infact, works for all engines, no intake or exhaust physics
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:44:54 <@!268855197697048598> , there's no intake/exhaust physics, so nothing gets burned or blocked, that's how some crafts work, with alot of internal engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:45:41 Not half bad!
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:47:06 <@456226577798135808> , don't try this dance with me, I've had to do it before with a hypocryte calling me "negger", and I'll out-dance you as well (If you don't understand witty commentary, basically someone tried to put off hiding "nig" with "neg" as stating someone else's video, for no apparent reason, directed at me)
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:47:25 I mean, extra boost of speed?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:28 I believe so, but we don't have in-game powers yet (Madattak needs to get on that, since he technically owns the game, but he's against it for some reason)
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:37 READ THE RULES BEFORE PINGING MAD OR RICK FOR ANYTHING
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:48:47 Just, read the rules before doing so, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:49:01 I guess because it looks nice enough?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:49:10 Anyways, that's a seriously nice TIE
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:50:07 ... Simply put don't ping Mad and Rick, they tend to be very busy
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:50:28 But anyways, team-build is already in progress, other ideas, first check <#507673335816126509> , then if you don't find your thing, check <#491710474786832394>
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:51:01 Because some people brush off the fucking rules Dip ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:51:25 Then don't comment about it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:52:11 The reason I mention things are either one of, multiple of
1: Someone did it in the past or something related to it
2: They are pre-emptive measures
3: To maintain order
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:52:23 DIP, you already requested inventor, now show us what it can do that's so inventor-worthy
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:53:18 Just post it here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:53:41 And if it's a .wmv after I shouted about how risky .wmv files are, and after the pinned messages, so help me ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:53:59 Well then, that's a pretty high capacity plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:54:13 Ello yousuf
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:56:15 Want any ranks for it or nah?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:57:23 Post it to me with the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:57:59 ... Alright, what's the idea, multiple drivable vehicles?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:58:58 That's not inventor, people have made entire flight formations before
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 16:59:05 Done
creations-chat 2018-12-07 16:59:55 That's not a tank, that's an oversized car
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:00:01 And those aren't bikes, those are cars
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:00:27 Ignacioel, he got your idea, but choked on the execution so badly
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:01 Let me put it this way, if you can think of it in under one month, it's PROBABLY already been made
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:13 Unless you're either very witty, very skilled, ambitious, or Ignacioel himself
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:01:29 That's modeler Mystic
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:02:44 With actual tank treads? Yeah, no, already been done
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:03:19 So basically a russian stacking, tank
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:03:48 ... <@456226577798135808> , then quit asking for inventor, if you can't bother thinking, then don't bother going for something that requires you using your brain for something other than garbage insults
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:04:29 Because they kept on trying to help you, and you just told them to fuck off
help 2018-12-07 17:04:47 Ahem
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:05:24 Then try putting it in a way that isn't as rude as hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:06:15 Make 2 variants Kratos, one blocky, one not blocky
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:06:50 ... You can't even quote me correctly, 
"then quit asking for inventor, if you can't bother thinking, then don't bother going for something that requires you using your brain for something other than garbage insults"
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:07:12 Inventor is the hardest and most mentally taxing role out there
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:07:48 ... Dip, are you sure you're not drunk or something?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:08:15 Uhhhh, are you serious Dip, are you actually 11?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:08:45 Sorry, Discord Terms of Service requires us that we request you to leave, let me find the category for you
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:09:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:10:07 We request that you leave
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:10:13 Yes, and we'll whack-a-mole them down as they appear
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:00 "If you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction"
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:04 You are 11, doesn't count
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:11:35 It's gotta react, that's the one caveat here
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:14 ... <@456226577798135808> , OY! ACTUALLY READ IT! I LITERALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE AREA YOU NEED TO READ
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:31 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:51 I am about to take executive action on a certain dumbass' face
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:12:57 Dip
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:06 DipTheKing_II
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:09 I highlighted the area
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:19 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/520648131814096896/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:30 I literally highlighted the area you need to read
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:34 And you REFUSE TO READ IT
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:13:50 Then put your eyes to the screen and read that area over, thoroughly
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:14:20 If you acted more maturely and sensibly, maybe we'd allow you in
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:14:25 Use Google
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:16:32 Oy <@!461577008317726732> , rule 2
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:17:09 Let's be honest, some people act more mature than full blown adults, so we allow them here
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:17:36 It's fine, but if you slip up again, that's a warning and a mute, if you slip up via images, two week mute as per protocol
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:17:55 I think that rocket counts if you can check the speed
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:18:02 Dip, you're right, you're worse
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:18:50 Marcus, ask him to clock the speed, he did one part of the Elon Musk challenge, if he can do part 2 and get a picture of his speed somehow, and if he's on this Discord, he'll get the rank
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:24 Yes yes, we get it Dip, you're modeling after shit people, get over it
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:34 Now can you please leave as per the Discord Terms of Service?
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:19:53 If you maybe acted more maturely, we would've not batted an eye
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:01 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:07 Well, that counts, hold on a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:19 Done Marcus
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:30 And no it's not a job
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:20:47 Last time I tried that Xpert shut me down Ignacioel, he NEEDS to do something, although
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:21:50 DipTheKing_II admitted to being underage to use Discord, as per the terms of service
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:22:14 And he absolutely REFUSES to do pretty much anything anyone asks him, not even bothering to read the outlined section here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/520648131814096896/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:22:55 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:23:16 Here's how
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:25:23 Marcus, if you act mature and kind to others, we might not bat some eyes to it, because some people have a mental maturity of 60 year olds, in the body of 10 year olds
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:25:58 Or, whatever batting your eye means, basically just act like you're grown up and responsible already
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:27:27 That's highly unbelievable, I'd believe 1 business and 1 mansion, and even then with alot of assistance from the parents
creations-chat 2018-12-07 17:27:53 Nice, same here
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:28:12 We banned Dip because he was underage
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:28:22 And acting like an immature little generic shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:28:42 Again, guys, read over this
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:29:20 If you act mature, wise and kind, we won't care about your age (Just don't blurt it out in public), but if you act like an immature little shit, banhammer time
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:54:32 Inferno, you do have an option to spawn there
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:54:53 Wait, you mean on the dock?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 17:54:57 Ah
help 2018-12-07 17:55:34 Hey, I shaved off the tail and right wing on the fighter, it still was flyable
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 19:23:31 Is that seriously an entire house on a boat?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 19:23:49 WELL THEN
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 19:24:26 That's, quite brilliant, in the dumbest and most fun of ways
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 19:25:42 Shaaarrrrrk! Nice
creations-chat 2018-12-07 19:25:52 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:15:25 Darkness shark vs Christmas F-22, who'd win
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:03:11 Guns have been made with working mags already, sorry, also, <@394828201215393794> , check the freaking pings, .wmvs are unsafe, we literally had a virus attack disguised as a .wmv at one point
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:04:04 Sorry, but you can't publish save .wmvs, convert it to some other form
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:04:50 Something that'd run naturally on Discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 00:18:04 Seems like mega shark started a fight
the-dump 2018-12-08 00:19:27 Uhhhh, <@282872552886501377> , that last one was really pushing it, so I wiped it, mind toning it down a bit?
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:30:40 Reblex, mags like were actually around for a freaking long while believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:31:17 I'm getting alot of internet lag, RIP
help 2018-12-08 00:31:31 You need to entirely disable RGB coloring
help 2018-12-08 00:31:46 So you can't use half custom colors and half pre-set colors, either all or none
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:32:24 Anyways, I call those kinds of mags grav mags, magazines that use gravity to pull the round down, before the age of magnets we used jets to simulate the projectiles launching out
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:32:26 Those aren't new, at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 05:10:26 Wyvern superfighter, something of my own design that I'm sure Empire's way too familiar with
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 01:59:30 <@400383286238511106> , that's not a swear, that's an NSFW piece of the human body
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 02:20:19 Wait, should I check if my creations are wiped?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:18:07 We're working it out because people keep on suggesting the same thing, even after they've been told to check over <#507673335816126509>  for their suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:18:23 Hell, sometimes I see people suggesting the same thing immediately after someone suggests it
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:19:17 <@!362351190618538005> , that's not how it works, it takes time and effort to make something, and that floods out the suggestions anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:19:58 You can, it's just we're filtering out people that spam suggestions to troll, and/or repeatedly suggest the same thing consistently and repeatedly to flood <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:20:26 <@!362351190618538005> , then what's the issue here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:25:56 I'd say it depends on consistency, if it's very inconsistent I'd probably go far more lenient on them, but if it's very consistent, like as soon as they're off the ban they're back to trolling, skip the 7 day and go straight to perma
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:26:19 Give it a spin
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:26:57 A real life bullet keeps it's self stable by spinning in the air (At least if my firearms knowledge is correct), same with certain objects, including rockets I think
bug-reports 2018-12-09 03:34:09 I mean a bullet has a spin applied to it via the barrel in order to keep it stable in the air
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:40:10 ... Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:43:11 We have a minimum of quality for certain builds, you can't build a mega cube
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:51:11 Thank Rick for most that <@!298129144422858752> , and support him via ads and crap if you want continued development
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:05:42 Not just no effort, pay to pay to play as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 04:06:44 I feel like a small warning sign should pop up: "Plane Crazy is more difficult than your average Roblox game, even among the building type. Please take this into consideration, if you do not wish to do so, please leave so as to avoid self-inflicted frustration"
creations-chat 2018-12-09 18:08:20 Maybe it was borrowed from/by the Japanese or something?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 18:46:49 Happened to me to in another game, seems like Roblox screwed up one of their main servers or something
creations-chat 2018-12-10 04:05:45 Steal them and give credit, that way you'll act as free advertising for their original creators
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 04:44:26 Eh, I'm just a bit out of ideas for Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:52:49 Ah, heh, whops, you still had the unranked "rank", sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:53:03 Just don't make up bullcrap on there and we'll be fine, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:53:15 At least, don't INTENTIONALLY make up constant bullcrap, and yeah?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:54:06 ... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:54:28 Don't post that kind of stuff again, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 06:58:52 Anyways, LTZ, if you're gonna make a military group for Plane Crazy, you'll want vehicles that handle well, or are aesthetically and lore-wise reasonable
creations-chat 2018-12-10 07:59:57 So very ultra supremely omega incredibly stupidly wrong that it's almost unfunny, but it imploded and is now funny again
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 08:00:14 OH! Hold on, you still have the unranked "rank"
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 08:01:08 There ya go, if anyone needs their unranked rank removed and have been somewhat active and have experimented with all the pieces in-game, ask me, I'll get to it when I'm back on (The last part is so you don't suggest something that's already been suggested)
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 14:53:04 If it wasn't so jittery, I would've thought it was a real life yacht or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 15:57:32 OY!
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 15:57:36 Ahem, none of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 15:58:43 ... Just, don't misspell it intentionally or so help me I'm going to beat your head with a bat (Not, actually going to do that, but you get the point)
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:01:01 <#497142796961054721> with that if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:03:04 ... Ben
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:03:16 I bothered you once about this
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:05:05 It's your only warning (as far as the log's aware), so just don't push it, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:05:12 If you're straightforward that's another warn and a mute
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:05:19 Also, that's actually really freaking cool Grab
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:06:12 Inferno, posting a picture of an NSFW, "event" isn't discussing it, yet it still breaks rule 2 with Thor's hammer, if it was rocket powered
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:07:03 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:08:00 Well try it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:26:04 To be honest, if I recall correctly, there's a reason that tanks don't have coaxial (multiple-turret) guns
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:42:18 You're allowed to have anything so long as it doesn't break the rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:43:27 Just remember that Discord rules apply quite a bit in-game as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:44:43 You're allowed to have a rainbow flying disco shrek-mobile
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:44:51 ... <@!301384851444203522> , that'd start alot of fights, so we're gonna say no
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:45:26 A hand with purpose other than making a middle finger, but that can make one (Surgeon Simulator style, anyone?) wouldn't count towards that though
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:45:36 But you need to give it a purpose outside of just that one role
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:46:02 Meaning it's gotta grab stuff, move each finger independently, etc
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:46:07 Yes, it has been made before Shrimp
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 16:46:42 Magnets don't affect other players because it'd be way too easy to troll with, they attract all blocks on your creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:13:48 ... Is that seriously Dip again?
the-dump 2018-12-10 17:14:02 Jesus H christ, IMPERIAL!
the-dump 2018-12-10 17:14:36 Well, you're right, it is the dump, so, whatever
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:14:49 Just, tell me, is it Dip or not
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:15:58 Riiiight, excuse me for a moment while I BREAK HIS FUCKING FACE (Not, literally, you get the point)
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:16:34 Is it a VIP server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:26:09 Proof Dip's light spamming: https://im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-617ef2741f05.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:54:01 Show him the images and gifs if possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:54:06 The gif might've timed out, so I'll get a new link
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:54:32 
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 17:54:58 Send him that one Grab
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:40:24 ... Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:47:53 Hey, I have a life to ya know, what is it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:48:33 Show me the screenshot with your name somewhere in it, and please submit the block count of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:48:52 Somewhere, preferably on the actual HUD
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:49:21 ... Welp, whatever, close enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:49:37 If someone shouts at you for stealing though, expect **ALOT** of backlash and retribution
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:50:30 Shrimp, if nobody else claims it within a certain time period, it's yours
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:50:39 But if someone finds it, reecognizes it and claims theft, we'll start investigating
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:51:23 Not, quite like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:51:29 Same build, ask for all the ranks associated with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:52:04 Let me show you a simple example
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:53:00 It's called lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:53:13 Laggier you are, more you wobble
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:54:00 This (Credit to Ignacioel) would count for technician, builder and modeler https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/509165689433620480/c6e0cbddadf056a737700ecf5aeb9c44.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 19:54:59 Yes, Ignacioel is famous for making absurd (in the best of ways) creations
general 2018-12-10 19:55:12 <@456226577798135808> AHEM

plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:11:54 ... How the hell did I start this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:12:07 ... <@456226577798135808> , can you please take that to the dump?
the-dump 2018-12-10 20:12:39 For fuck's sake, Inferno, don't egg it on ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:13:24 ... <@456226577798135808> , if you keep it up I'm going to shut you down whether you like it or not, now can it, everyone has their own opinion
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:13:31 <@!287233830576848906> , can you please, cut it out?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:13:55 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:14:27 Right, __**ALL OF YOU CAN IT, NEXT PERSON TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT "FURRIES" AT ALL WILL GET WARNED AND MUTED FOR THE REST OF THE FUCKING DAY**__
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:14:36 **GOT IT!?**
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:16:32 <@456226577798135808> , can you quit trying to hate upon everything, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:16:43 Oy, all of you, no suicide jokes for fuck's sake, I'm having absolutely none of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:17:48 ... Guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:17:52 Just, cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:18:07 Guys/ladies/people/whateverthefuckyouallareIdon'tcare, cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:18:26 "Whatever the fuck you all are, **I DON'T CARE**"
general 2018-12-10 20:19:37 Rob, don't think I didn't see that, it's in the chat logs
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:19:57 Slowmode is on because people keep on chatting far, far too rapidly
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:20:22 "Eventually", leave it at that, would you rather have snow, or new and exciting (highly usable) parts before that?
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:21:48 Can you please not post in .wmvs, we have gone over this many, many times
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:21:52 Simply put, it's a virus threat
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:22:02 We already nearly got virus attacked once via .wmv
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:22:57 I'll trust you as far as I can throw you, and considering I can't even touch you, how the hell am I supposed to throw you?
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:23:29 ... Aero, no, just use some other converter
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:23:46 It's not a Minecraft reference, and we can't determine that state
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:24:08 What you can do is have a pair of pistons with a space in between so they don't weld together
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:24:13 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:27:02 Alvin, VIP servers are a thing
bug-reports 2018-12-10 20:30:02 It's enough that we get the general idea, Rick will look into that when he has the time
creations-chat 2018-12-10 20:30:13 Batmobile thing?
creations-chat 2018-12-10 20:33:18 More like I'm trying to make sure <#384021699466756107> doesn't turn into another shitstorm of an argument
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:34:18 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:34:52 There, it's gone now
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:34:58 End of freaking argument
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:46:56 It's <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:47:11 Then quit complaining and start using it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:47:21 Because if nobody uses it, then what good will a shitpost channel do?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:47:27 People won't use THAT
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:49:28 Sonnuy, detail how it'd look then
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:50:50 Flame, that wouldn't work out ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:51:36 Because Xpert decided to veto our suggestion to move it, and he's the server owner
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:51:55 Ask him __**WHEN HE'S ONLINE**__, but try not to ping spam him
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:53:40 <@456226577798135808> , check <#507673335816126509> , you'll find that about 9 billion people have suggested whitelisting, and it's already being made
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:53:51 What's the problem?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:54:09 Alright, and?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:54:11 Not you Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:54:57 There's a thing called "lock" mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:55:22 Maybe if you spent half a second to actually check the cappabilities of the motors you would've seen it was right there infront of your face with a giant toggle button
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:56:01 Then set a block that extends or something that you can slam the motors back to in order to reset the alignment
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 20:56:38 Then blame Rick for it, he's trying to fix it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:49:44 Are you, honestly fucking serious that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:49:54 Tell me, what is it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:50:35 ... What, is it, also <@461111372239994881> , I've had enough assholes for one day, now tone it down and quit acting like one before I treat you like one
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:51:18 This part's the "don't be an asshole" part I'm referring to
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:51:35 That, cut it out, just tell me what is it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:52:00 That, Cat, whatever, guy with blue TCIB in his icon with that and cat in his username
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:52:10 Alright, fine, cool, what do you want for that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 22:52:37 No need to ping me for that then
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:48:55 We had a problem with that in the past, lots of people spammed out repeat suggestions, not even bothering to actually check <#507673335816126509>  to see if their idea was implemented
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:49:12 It sorta hit it's breaking point when like 2-3 people suggested the exact same thing in a row
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:49:27 Check <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:19 Point, think of how difficult it'd be
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:33 Also, Supernova, ladders can be implemented by half blocks or wing pannels
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:52 Meanwhile, "pilot seats that control anythnig", have you TRIED setting custom keybinds? No offense
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:58 Flame, you can't make functional ladders that tiny
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:52:26 I am aware, any smaller and they won't be functional, it's been tried
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:52:55 Pilot seats are like the main pilot seat, except you don't spawn in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:00 The main pilot seat is the one you spawn in
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:35 No co-op flying sadly Linh, but it's being implemented eventually
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:46 ... <@!272165213372153856> , I learned all of this crap on the first day of exposure to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:02 Lesson 1: "Hit, ALL THE BUTTONS, to see what they do"
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:16 Yes geinuous?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:27 FFS EVERYONE SLOW DOWN A BIT PLEASE, jesus christ
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:56 I don't want to add slowmode because every single person whines about it whenever the value's increased
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:55:14 Right now it's set to 1 second, just incase someone tries to spam up the chat with pictures or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:55:31 Right, if you need a quick tutorial, go to <#501034677793193994> , or watch the tutorial again
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:55:47 ... <@!272165213372153856> , wasn't there a tutorial that was supposed to go over all the basic functions?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:01 Uhhhh, Prov, it goes through the basics of getting most vehicles working
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:07 Anything else requires extra brainpower
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:11 Yes, the in-game tutorial
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:45 If pistons really aren't that self-explanatory, then no offense, but please see yourself out
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:58:13 The game requires actual brainpower usage and curiosity, if you lack both of those, then you won't have fun with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:59:42 Yes, we get it <@373585820436660226> , please don't spam that out
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:59:57 I'm gonna start pinging people based on who I'm responding to, be aware everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:00:35 <@!272165213372153856> , everyone has their own style in Plane Crazy, that's the thing, we don't want carbon copies of the same player
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:01:15 <@!264769733021270016> , just leave it to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:01:59 <@!272165213372153856> , people ARE willing to teach you about more complex mechanisms, such as tri-axis joints, but you need to understand basic mechanisms first
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:02:28 <@!272165213372153856> , basic mechanisms are suppose to be self-explanatory, we'll help with the more complex ones, such as warp drives or adjustable suspension
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:02:41 <@!324607962079297536> , that's called good design
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:03:38 
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:04:06 <@!99607451300548608> , RIP
<@!324607962079297536> , exactly the point, you may notice these carbon copies are infact the people that "need help"
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:04:18 <@373585820436660226> , can you cut it out?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:04:50 Well what am I supposed to do!? Plus nobody seemed to mind, and the chat was being flooded to hell earlier
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:05:09 They help organize which message goes to who
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:05:25 ... Plzkil, that's not what we wanted
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:05:34 Well, I'm only pinging people actively participating in the chat, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:05:56 ... <@373585820436660226> , you were already booted once for being obnoxious, do you really want to rip up that "Second chance" ticket you have?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:06:45 I'm about to make it vanish, and thus you're about to be banned from the server, do you REALLY want that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:06:59 If not, quit being obnoxious to other people
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:07:02 Yes muffin?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:07:33 Also, Linh, if I understand how rockets work, they work basically similar to how the actual Roblox rockets work, you know, the 4X1X1 ones that come out of the shoulder-held tool?
help 2018-12-11 00:07:54 Ballasts can actually be adjusted to be lighter than traditional blocks, but helium has negative weight
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:08:11 Muffin, how exactly am I young?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:08:17 Flame, you're way off, and I'm not saying which direction
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:08:28 Imperial is, somewhere within the ballpark
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:09:04 I mimiced it off of someone I looked up to saying "within the ballpark", meaning it's within the general area
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:09:15 Dark, you'll want some form of stabilization, I'd suggest giving your rocket a spin via propeller blades
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:09:19 Muffin, incorrect
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:09:46 Nope, quit guessing Muffin
help 2018-12-11 00:10:08 Flame, Prov, break it up
help 2018-12-11 00:10:10 I'll explain
help 2018-12-11 00:10:25 <@!272165213372153856> , they act like regular blocks, except they have negative mass rather than positive mass, compared to ballast blocks or regular blocks
help 2018-12-11 00:10:57 I wanted to stop you at the "ok idiot" part Flame
help 2018-12-11 00:11:04 Again, use them as regular blocks with negative mass
help 2018-12-11 00:11:08 They will attach like regular blocks to
help 2018-12-11 00:11:40 Yes, Prov, it should've been obvious when I said "they act like regular blocks", namely considering regular blocks weld on all connectable sides
help 2018-12-11 00:12:00 Which, for the regular 1X1X1 block, is all 6 faces of the cube
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:12:37 ... Please tell me this is a joke between you two that I don't get
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:13:04 Alright, that's all I needed to know, as long as Flame's fine with it and it doesn't get too out of hand
help 2018-12-11 00:16:58 Right, wing blocks can only attach on the side, not above or below them, replace the wing panel with a half block pointed either up or down, or a whole block
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:17:55 The chat went berserk tank, sorry if you got caught in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:48:45 Point, we can't completely stop these people right off the bat
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:49:01 Wait, they were unverified, how the f-
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:52:15 We're all terribly sorry about this, we had a breach in security, please wait patiently while we try to fix this
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:54:03 Shutting down all chats until we do emergency maintenance, we're currently being raided by NSFW bots from a single source
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:54:15 If anyone has ANY information, please DM me immediately
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:05:09 Channel is now on high alert, anyone that seems suspicious should be immediately reported to the nearest and most trusted mod
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:06:55 Right, for those that are unaware, it is okay to copy Discord IDs, hence why they allow us to do so in the first place
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:07:11 For those that are unfamiliar, you'll want to turn on developer mode, which I have shown here
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:08:43 If you do so after what happened pzkil, so help me
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:02 Spooky, long story short we had an NSFW bot pop in and start spamming
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:06 It bypassed the verification system
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:19 He's not in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:23 Check again
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:41 Spooky, we've had an issue with NSFW bots
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:09:58 <@!315891319308550145> , do you know anything about who the hell did this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:10:57 Which omni?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:11:08 Ziggy or Owles?
the-dump 2018-12-11 01:12:40 Skyrim mods
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:13:19 Yes Colin?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:13:48 Also, just incase it happens again so we can clean it up faster
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:14:32 Yes, but you're a mod potatoe, if someone tries spamming it again, they'll, at most, get one image off before we ban them
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:14:55 ... Jack, now's not the time for jokes
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:15:03 Or, jem
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:15:08 Whatever, it says jack in the chat log
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:15:24 ... <@456226577798135808> , the server's on high alert, we're banning anyone suspicious
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:16:30 Then again, that was an NSFW bot Imperial, I still hold the record for longest ban on an actual person
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:16:58 I think it was multiple accounts being run from one computer, at most, considering they posted nearly simultaneously
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:18:24 He did actually chat at first, but at the same time, you seem to know ALOT <@373585820436660226>
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:20:10 You are, VERY suspicious <@373585820436660226> , you seem to know alot, too much infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:20:52 Then tell us, who do you think it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:20:59 Because it's SOMEONE in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:21:45 Jem, that's still dangerous, considering you can send stuff through the phone
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:22:35 If it was you, own up and I'll call the investigation off, and trust me when I say there's people outside if Discord looking for who the fuck did this
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:23:13 Jem, we have quite a bit of leniency with swears to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:23:26 Uhhh, hell no, the Roblox chat filter's oversensitive
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:25:30 You slipped in beforehand
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:32:43 We got raided by an NSFW bot
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:34:37 It was bypassed somehow
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:34:46 We suspect that it's someone in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:37:22 In my book you're one step from a ban plzkil
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 01:37:51 <@!300736152615387137> , NSFW bot
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:04:23 I have been ITCHING to do that for a while and he finally gave me an excuse to do so
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:08:41 Emsix was the NSFW bot
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:14:56 ... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:15:25 Explain, what the fuck, you mean by that <@!314219571995344897> , and don't spam out "that" again as your only canned and pathetic response like last time
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:15:53 Because you are so completely and totally obnoxious it makes my skin crawl, and you always take every opportunity to try to attack me in some way, shape and/or form
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:16:46 .... This is what I mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:16:53 This, this is what I mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:17:05 Likely those were previous ones
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:17:10 Anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:17:44 UHHH
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:17:57 Whops
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:18:08 I made a note to only count one of them Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:18:14 Plus you do honestly deserve it, you never leave me alone
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:19:37 Try patting it down and hiding it <@373585820436660226>
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:19:49 We want this to vanish into obscurity as fast as possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:19:54 ... Don't think about it too hard
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:20:20 Dragon, I told you what happened for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:21:51 I'll do the same to you plz if you don't stop, just, don't make me please
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:30:46 It's a leave message
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 02:31:27 It's DragonMage, not DragonJasper
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:06:28 Better idea, eyedropper tool, so you can re-select any colors you've used
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:06:53 You could manually save the color palette on separate blocks, sorta like an artist's, whatever it's called
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:07:01 The thing that they use to hold paint with
creations-chat 2018-12-11 05:11:03 God damn that looks nice ._.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:16:24 Magma, underwater engines aren't exactly, useful, per se
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:22:22 I mean, we ARE missing those kinds of wedges, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:24:23 Different pieces
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:24:44 A 1700 blank plane won't lag, but a plane of 1300 light blocks will make every single person's computer shit their pants
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 05:39:56 Light as in bright blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:28:23 You have the unranked rank, whops
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 21:28:35 You're clear now haugh
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:01:14 You have the unranked "rank", which was originally just a marker for those that haven't acquired a rank within the server now, but as due to recent issues of new players repeatedly spamming the same suggestion, not bothering to check <#507673335816126509> to see if it was already suggested, and suggesting already-implemented ideas that they couldn't bother actually doing, we have locked it down
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:12:21 We have doors already, and if we make ladders any smaller, they won't work
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:12:29 Quite literally we can't make them any smaller if we tried
creations-chat 2018-12-11 22:20:59 Finally some love for the scifi industry, thank you
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:36:29 Sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:36:58 Empire's?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:51:00 Ahem ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:51:12 "dig bick", don't think I don't know what you're saying Dragon
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:54:26 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:54:30 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:54:39 !infractions <@!314219571995344897>
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:54:41 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:54:55 FINALLY that piece of shit's gone though, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:55:33 Let's see what he does
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:55:56 Dragonmage is
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:56:08 He's, SERIOUSLY annoying, and continues bugging me nonstop
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:56:18 Wait, I wonder
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:57:13 Anyone mind if I test something on them?
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:57:34 Got it Aero
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:57:50 !tempmute <@!319216576286949379> 1E+1m Testing
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:57:54 RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:58:15 I was gonna try doing 9e9999999
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:58:24 Which means 9, with 999999 zeros behind it
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:58:40 I know Aero, I was gonna umute you afterwards
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:58:56 It didn't work, testing failed on that part, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:59:09 Hey, if something happened I would've tried helping a workaround
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 22:59:16 I vote yes, I want that fucker to suffer an die
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:00:24 Hold on

plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:03:19 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:04:00 Utilice un programa de traducción para traducir al inglés. Si desea permanecer en el servidor, tenemos una regla que indica que se trata principalmente de un servidor de habla inglesa, esta es su última advertencia, ya que tenemos que hacer cumplir la regla 10, que es una regla. Eso dicta que las personas hablan inglés por coherencia.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:04:14 That translates to "Please use a translation program to translate into english if you wish to stay in the server, we have a rule stating that this is primarily an english speaking server, this is your last warning, as we have to enforce rule 10, which is a rule that dictates that people speak english for the sake of consistency"
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:05:13 I have a feeling it's DragonMage anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:05:28 Considering he kisses Dragon's ass and always comes on when Dragon's off, and the two never chat together
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:05:57 Alright rule 10 guys, come on
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:06:16 Jackal, we had a spanish speaker try to reason with him before I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:06:27 He didn't listen, it's not that it's a shit translator, it's that he's refusing to comply
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:07:27 ... <@208984450443247616> , it's literally rule 2, right in your face in <#512414682552729601>
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:07:34 Dragon's not actually in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:07:37 You're trying to ban a ghost
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:07:53 I think that's the permaban system
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:08:45 I literally have an emergency ban system to shut down anyone if they try posting any NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:08:56 He's trying to get a global permaban, so Dragonmage can't come back on through alternate accounts
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:09:19 Potatoe's on, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:09:49 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:10:13 <@208984450443247616> , if you ask another question, I will freaking strangle you, there's no NSFW allowed, at all, under any circumstances whatsoever
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:04 <@208984450443247616> , if you THINK it's NSFW, it probably is NSFW, so no bits showing, no suggestive images, no nothing
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:18 I'm not afraid to do a rapid response and get people banned for that shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:11:51 Aero, no
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:12:25 Right, let's end this conversation with "NSFW is not, has not, and will not be allowed on this Discord server at all, under any circumstances whatsoever"
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 23:14:41 <@208984450443247616> , go to <#497142796961054721>  or <#495286269459300364> with that, in that case, <#495286269459300364>

plane-crazy 2018-12-12 00:58:32 Let's see then
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 00:59:33 Just show me
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 01:01:05 What's your verdict Empire?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 01:03:43 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 01:04:32 Copying's a serious problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 01:11:42 No idea, we're checking it over though
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 01:12:06 Look, that's the best answer I can give at the moment, okay? Please wait and be patient, many of us are investigating it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:52:13 The hell is that at?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:52:55 Seriously <@!354786846049566720> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:53:40 Thatcat wants an invite
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:53:45 Should I?
help 2018-12-12 03:54:52 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so you must have set those motors to rotate the same way
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:55:04 Got it, hold on
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:56:09 Ranks have been renewed
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:56:14 It's real
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:56:23 You can check now ya know
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:56:42 .... Thatcat, look at your ranks
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:59:06 Well GG Legendary, we'll make sure to use our picture
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:59:27 Also, any ideas as to how to expand upon the nose?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 03:59:42 It's almost ready Imperial, I just need a few finishing touches, including larger nose based wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:02:07 Wings, not nose gun, although good point, I should probably add some form of nose gun (or nose gun placeholder)
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:02:42 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:05:33 Orange might have issues with that, but meh, whatever
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:05:36 Just quit making it a huge deal
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:06:06 So fuse the two together?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:06:24 That's, easier said than done, considering there's no middle delta wing
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:09:02 So something like this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:09:16 I'm just trying to outline it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:09:47 Do note this is ABOVE the current section, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:10:01 I'm trying to get a general outline of it in order to see if it's what you mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:10:44 The problem is I have no pyramid delta wing
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:11:55 More like this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:01 Do note, those are 1X4s on the end, not custom built noses, this thing's huge, but it ain't that huge
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:05 If you want
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:12 There's only 3 people in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:14 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:20 Who?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:26 It's not a VIP server, public server
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:13:36 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:14:08 Just search me up!
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:14:16 Aaaahhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:14:21 Imperial, slight problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:14:29 Notice that they're separate by one block?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:14:58 Yeah, you sorta see the problem I've been having now, right Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:15:34 Well that means he's the first to use that name
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:15:59 Or, it's a weird thing, dunno
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:16:35 Alright, I'll see what I can do
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:17:52 So like this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:18:11 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:18:44 Well then why not just make it solid?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:19:22 Like this
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:19:48 I mean, what do you think honestly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:20:05 Not enough to drag it out entirely, but it's enough that I at least nudge the center of lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:26:47 Alright alright I'll get to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:28:29 I think you passed the junior rank, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:29:35 Okay I need to redesign the front wings to be honest, any ideas?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:29:48 Like, not just re-sketch, completely redesign
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:29:58 And I need it to be larger than before, alot larger infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:30:41 Like, I need this one block further forwards larger
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:30:58 DON'T ask how it flies currently, it actually does believe it or not
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:31:24 I am not sharing my trade ~~magic~~ secrets though
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:40:07 Still waiting for the redesign to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:40:15 X_Vil, he's been with us for a while, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 04:52:42 Almost finished
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 05:07:42 And it's finished

plane-crazy 2018-12-12 05:09:19 What do you think Imperial?

plane-crazy 2018-12-12 05:11:29 RIP Bio, as long as he doesn't drag it in here we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 05:11:56 Can I do an "@ everyone" in the tower Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 05:15:46 It's semi-active
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:00 You're using it, for COMBAT!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:17:13 Then what's with the guns?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:22:36 Shall we put that to the test Future?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:22:48 See just how effective it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:23:10 I'll bring out my Wyvern fighter, which is combat tested in the current meta, and has yet to loose, at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:23:25 Because stuff like that is boring!
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:26:21 All it'd take is one good shot and GG, I win
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:28:44 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:28:48 <@456226577798135808> , do that and we'll ban you
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:28:49 Got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:30:10 And I'll blast ya again if you even think about it!
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 06:31:32 There's no head mod
creations-chat 2018-12-12 06:51:21 Suggest the color scheme then?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:05:36 Hmmmm, hey <@!489332654290894888> , mind if I borrow the overall shape for a later build?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:09:25 I'll say "Original shape was based off of pwoering_moneys' vehicle"
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:10:23 I meant the view from the top, but alright, sounds good
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:11:33 Well more specifically, whatever, I'll just give you the credit for it when I finish it (Probably over the weekend)
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:12:30 Trying to make it a stealth plane?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:13:03 Don't forget, someone can change it to night time and spot you
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:13:22 113, 196, 211
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:13:33 But watch the lightning and night mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:14:40 This one was the one I was thinking of https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/522320250457423882/RobloxScreenShot20181212_085359403.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 08:19:21 That's the primary blue color
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 15:13:29 Because read <#491710474786832394> , whitelist has been suggested a billion times, and it's already being made
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 15:24:42 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 16:21:47 You've gotta note, this is Roblox, not Kerbal
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:46:58 Then can you please change it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:47:16 <@456226577798135808> , you shouldn't have done it in the first place
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:47:23 Hold on, let me handle that
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:47:44 <@!227555337945743360> , can you please leave and change your PFP, then come back with something fine?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:47:58 I have taken a picture of your ranks
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:48:20 Well, whatever, just change it somehow
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:48:39 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:48:46 Give me a moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:49:38 Please change your PFP to something more, appropriate, even if it's borderline NSFW, you yourself said it was NSFW, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:50:23 Yes Battleship, it's still a piece of an NSFW pic though ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:50:31 So just to be safe, we'd like him to change it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:50:46 Unless he truly wants to cause a riot in the server, in which case we will take action
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:51:31 Because it's the "anime pfp" that's NSFW, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:36 ... <@!227555337945743360> , then you should have no problem changing it, at least for this server
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:52:45 Unless you well and truly want to just cause problems
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:53:11 I'm gonna make an announcement about this
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:54:39 There
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:54:52 Check <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:55:51 Battleship, I don't mind anime, I just mind it once anime turns into (redacted unless I get rick/mad/Xpert's permission)
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:56:18 Because <@!227555337945743360> , they weren't cropped from an NSFW picture, there's SFW anime and NSFW "anime"
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:58:22 Anime is fine, we don't judge, it's just when anime turns NSFW that we seriously judge
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:58:47 Oh yeah, Grab, did you see the MK4 fighter I had?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 17:59:33 Well, you'll recognize the color scheme Grab if you scroll up in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:00:15 <@!227555337945743360> , Just, please, drop it, we want to be absolutely certain about this stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:00:55 Who actually cares about what theme people use!? Just use whatever theme works for you!
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:01:34 ....
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:32:56 ... So <@456226577798135808> , just because it's Roblox, I can say "Fuck you, go hang yourself, and shoot your family while you're at it"? Because that's basically what you're implying
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:33:13 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:33:27 If you seriously consider that a joke then sorry, but you have some messed up sense of humor
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:34:23 Others might care about what you say to them, and not everyone's the same, so consider that before blabbing out what others view as threats
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:34:51 "Obviously a joke", someone tried to pull the "obviously a joke" card before and they're now in the banned bin
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:35:39 ... Then fuck you, go shoot yourself, your family, and every other person close to you (If you couldn't tell, I don't actually mean it, I'm trying to mimic what you did/are saying)
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:36:27 That's exactly the point I'm trying to make, and why I made a note in parenthesis that I wasn't actually meaning it nor being serious, just giving him a good look in the mirror
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:37:17 ... Tell him to talk to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:37:49 <@456226577798135808> , I know you can see this, now then
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:48:57 FFS, just, don't question it <@!268855197697048598> , we've got our hands tied by the Roblox rules and regulations
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:50:24 Anyways, <@!268855197697048598> , we're trying to be better safe than sorry, as Roblox is nothing if not completely and totally unpredictably inconsistent
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:51:38 Here's why
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:54:55 ... That's, a bit much, the thing was he cropped his image straight from a direct NSFW "anime" image
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:55:35 I can find the quote that he himself mentioned you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:56:59 Allow me to present, evidence 1 and 2
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:57:03 
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:57:55 He threatened to do so, and he also already had a PFP that was considered NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:58:30 Right can we cut this out before some random Roblox user rolls onto this, thinks we're really a, you know, channel and tries to complain to Roblox to shut us down or something?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:59:24 Believe me that didn't stop Roblox from burning down another Discord for another game
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:59:59 We care because they can still affect us
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:00:08 Sonnuy, there's no real way to enforce that
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:00:24 Plus that'd chase off a good chunk of people that Discord is advertised to
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:00:37 Then this isn't really the Plane Crazy Discord anymore now is it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:00:54 What am I supposed to say? "Broadcasted to"?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:01:06 ... sonnuy, that's completely counterintuitive
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:01:53 That's the weird and uncomfortable catch-22 we're in, we've gotta follow Roblox's rules for making it highly child-friendly, but also Discord's ToS, where nobody under 13 can be allowed
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:02:15 If we piss off Roblox, RIP Plane Crazy, if we piss off Discord, RIP this server
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:03:37 ... Can you please not <@!268855197697048598> , what it implies is that we know there are people under 18 here, quite a few infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:04:12 Let me point out, this
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:05:02 <@!227555337945743360> , we honestly don't care so long as they act old enough, as Imperial pointed out, as long as they're mature enough, they're allowed in, we already banned one person because he/she acted highly immaturely
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:06:20 That "girl blushing" is considered an NSFW reaction ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:06:37 <@!268855197697048598> , we're trying the best we can, it's not like I can datamine everyone's personal info ya know
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:07:48 <@!227555337945743360>  and <@!268855197697048598> , we're allowing them in because they act far more maturely than their current age, which means they're self-conscious enough to be on the server just fine, and accept faults
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:08:27 If someone starts acting like an immature little shit, which has happened before as we've mentioned, we shut them down
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:09:18 ... They can't enforce every single server, not to mention so long as we remain mostly child friendly we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:09:54 ..... Guys, do you want the Plane Crazy server to exist, or do you want to break it apart?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:10:49 Quite frankly you're one to talk after this <@!227555337945743360>
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:12:40 .... This is geting seriously annoying seriously fast, we're slightly bending the ToS, not downright flagrantly breaking them, in order to keep competitive within the actual Roblox environment
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:13:34 He was joking, Orange acts young sometimes, and we don't know his age
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:15:25 Alright, this is honestly getting obnoxious, <@!268855197697048598> , <@!227555337945743360> , what exactly are you two trying to get at here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:16:14 Do you want us to completely cull the server and drag it back down by about 1.3K (rough estimate), or do you want us to try the other way, and keep it child friendly enough to be considered not enough of a problem to be bothered?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:17:03 ... We literally just bugged someone about an egocentric thought process, right <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:17:24 Alright
Done, I banned all users known to be under 13
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:17:35 Aka: Nobody
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:18:06 Grab, not enough snow
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:19:44 ... <@!227555337945743360> 1: Specifics on that?
2: How exactly are we supposed to do that?

<@!268855197697048598> , you do realize that people under even 6 have phones, right? I've literally seen 3 year olds tapping away on fucking Candy Crush for crap's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:20:29 ... Hectic, still doesn't make it fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:21:17 <@!268855197697048598> , don't you think we already have that as a precaution?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:21:52 <@456226577798135808> , not everyone believe it or not (no offense but you probably don't)
<@!260797229068058634> , just mute it temporarily, I'll DM you when it's clear
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:22:42 ... <@456226577798135808> , CAN YOU PLEASE CUT IT OUT THINKING YOU AND YOUR CLASS ARE THE ONLY TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT EXIST!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:23:11 <@!227555337945743360> , that's what we got Ro-Ver for
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:23:40 It's more useful than just allowing random shitstains on here incase you're wondering!
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:24:05 That's because it auto-verifies you if you verified on another Roblox Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:24:30 Then I don't know, you did it at one point in time, otherwise how the hell are you in the server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:25:16 ... <@!268855197697048598> , I meant in the server and verified, I thought you would've been smart enough to think it through
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:26:08 ......
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:26:41 <@!227555337945743360> , let me figure out why then, you wouldn't happen to have a Roblox account named someone_pointless, would you?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:27:11 Then it's auto-naming you as that, and you must've verified at one point in time, or through an automatic verification
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:27:51 <@!268855197697048598> , just quit thinking about it too hard, that's the difficulty of being in a weird and nebulous situation like we're currently in with this server
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:27:59 <@456226577798135808> , post a picture of your ranks and you'll re-acquire them
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:28:10 .....
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:28:31 Riiight, that's it, <@!268855197697048598> , sorry, but I've had enough threat to take the server down from you
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:29:27 Hectic, what do you want us to do? Travel back in time and get them for you? We're not your godly slaves
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:29:34 ... I do remember seeing those two, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:29:55 There, you got those two back, everything else I don't remember
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:31:12 The thing is Hectic, you sorta deserved it, need I point out this "the world orbits around me" mentality again? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/522485699757473807/Capture_67.PNG
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:32:53 ... **HECTIC** for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:33:04 I literally said, not everyone's like you and your class
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:33:15 I literally said you aren't the only person in the world
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:33:31 Yet here you are trying to push the mentality that everyone's like you, you're the perfect image, and any deviations are flaws in society
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:35:05 Slowmode won't help, and Hectic, shut up about that, I can show you the document that proves you entirely wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:35:23 It's not a universal thing, it's opt-in, and not only that, it's opt-in by the parents
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:35:43 Sorry <@297788430652407810> , please ignore the generic shitstorm/shit tornado going on over here, we'll clean it up in a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:36:31 <@456226577798135808> , there's a difference between SFW anime and NSFW stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:36:41 Riiight, if you don't mind let's drag it to <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-12-12 19:37:09 From <#384021699466756107> <@456226577798135808> , an emoji can show "bits", incase you're wondering
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:37:33 ... Move it to <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-12-12 19:37:49 There's such things as custom Discord emojis you know, where people can post whatever they want
general 2018-12-12 19:38:06 Do you, HONESTLY think that's not NSFW?
general 2018-12-12 19:38:28 Because literally anyone can post their own custom emoji with certain Discord purchases
general 2018-12-12 19:39:11 HELL, I CAN POST A DANCING RUSSIAN TRANSFORMER HELI AS AN EMOJI IF I WANTED TO AND HAD THE MONEY, but I don't because I'm a sensible person
general 2018-12-12 19:39:27 Sonnuy, if you dare we'll blast you with a ban and clean up your mess
general 2018-12-12 19:40:14 It's alot harder to tell if it's a joke or not on the computer, you can't put sarcasm in the text unless you do something like "Kill yourself (I'm joking)"
general 2018-12-12 19:40:33 And people do make genuine death threats on Roblox servers, that aren't jokes ...
general 2018-12-12 19:41:28 It's the only surefire way to make sure the other people know it's a joke, otherwise some random person might come on and think you aren't joking Hectic
general 2018-12-12 19:42:19 You think there's a reason people don't want you to do it?
general 2018-12-12 19:42:47 And randomly going "kill yourself" or "go die" to a person you've never met before provides zero context
general 2018-12-12 19:42:49 ...
general 2018-12-12 19:42:50 Hectic
general 2018-12-12 19:43:05 <@456226577798135808> , Hectic "dear"
general 2018-12-12 19:43:16 If you don't mind me asking
general 2018-12-12 19:43:20 Erase that statement
general 2018-12-12 19:43:21 Now
general 2018-12-12 19:43:44 <@456226577798135808> , erase the statement about people not wanting to die, if you don't mind
general 2018-12-12 19:44:30 Erase it ...
general 2018-12-12 19:44:59 Don't mention, nobody wants to die, ever again, got it?
general 2018-12-12 19:45:33 You're looking at nearly non-living proof that your statement, is complete, and total, bull, fucking, shit
general 2018-12-12 19:45:59 Now quit acting like everyone's a senseless robot, and consider how we're all human
general 2018-12-12 19:46:54 Then keep on making fun of everyone as one big joke, and see how deep a grave you will dig for yourself
general 2018-12-12 19:48:00 ... Hectic, if you can't take anything seriously, then please, just leave, we don't need a toxic clown in here
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:49:16 Sonnuy, he said nobody's suicidal, and he tried to pass it off as joking
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:49:26 That's not something you joke about, you fucking piece of shit
creations-chat 2018-12-12 19:50:42 Then switch it to only day
help 2018-12-12 19:51:12 Changing the color of your name in the server
help 2018-12-12 19:51:28 Figure it out yourself, I'll show you the starting line: Motors
creations-chat 2018-12-12 19:51:48 Second one looks more varried, first one looks more uniform
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:53:08 All you need to know Grab is that Hectic started saying nobody was suicidal, then tried to pass it off as a joke, and said everything he says is a joke, in an attempt to avoid punishment ...
help 2018-12-12 19:53:23 I think so, not 100% sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:53:57 ... Fucking hell <@!384389519933440001>
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:54:07 If you don't know that chain of reactions, don't think about it and erase it from your mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:54:15 If you do, don't comment about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:54:30 <@!348558315086675969> , Learn it yourself, that way we don't have to teach you every single time, start with motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:55:01 Mhm, they rotate on one axis, so what happens if you tilt the rotors
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:55:17 Because cameras are an invisible block that points in one direction that your camera locks onto
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:55:50 That might be a possibility, we do have helium blocks, which have negative weight after all
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:56:24 Helium is a "BIT" too strong to counter it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:58:13 Yellow, here's an idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:58:19 Er, actually Danny stated the idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:00:30 <@!348558315086675969> , Look at ashp's creation, see how that works?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:00:38 Now try applying that to your sweeping wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:01:27 Yellow, why not just attach two cameras, one to the front, the other to the back?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:01:34 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:02:40 T4CT, use motors that are rotated
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:03:31 Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:03:38 Also, by ships what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:03:42 Like battleships and such?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:03:47 I have no idea what the next contest will be
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:04:06 NOT BY A .WMV PLEASE
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:04:17 Probably next week
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:04:32 <@!314555223140073472> , we were virus attacked by .wmv files before, so could you please put it as a GIF?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:05:00 <@!348558315086675969> , Ah, well you're gonna have to think of a complex mechanic, but it will involve motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:05:25 He wants the "shoulder" part of the wings to drag forwards is the thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:14:19 As far as I can see it's an empty foggy, thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:16:53 ... <@!314555223140073472> , .wmv files can be virus filled, use a gif converter or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:17:26 You can convert those to gifs using programs and such
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 20:23:34 Yes
the-dump 2018-12-12 20:54:44 Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:41:41 
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:42:20 I mean, what am I supposed to do?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:43:05 Simply put he was muted for apparently alot of toxicity, and then he starts messaging me about removing it, ignores the fact that everyone thought he was toxic, and proceeded to ask for a further mute
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:43:15 As shown in the screenshot up above
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:45:33 
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:46:39 Outabounds, whops
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:47:16 Beat me to the punch, damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 22:50:54 I tried, we got an out of bounds error
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 23:05:31 Ignore that, behind the scenes stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 23:06:05 If you're wondering, no we're not banning people, we're reworking the ban duration of someone
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 23:06:29 Don't ask
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 23:53:56 Madje?
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 23:54:13 What did I stumble into?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:42:29 Right what the fuck's going on?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:43:46 Maybe it's your fault then, not everyone gets this kind of treatment
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:43:52 Also, <@373585820436660226> , enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:44:13 Totten, I was getting sick of it, it wasn't for you
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:44:31 ... <@373585820436660226> , drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , preferably the latter
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:47:01 ... Seriously?
creations-chat 2018-12-13 00:47:39 Congrats, you have ranks, please check over <#507673335816126509> to see if your suggestion's already there before suggesting, and think about what you want to suggest long and hard
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:48:03 Do you honestly think that the people who made Discord are going to care about one server in about a billion servers?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 00:51:21 ... <@373585820436660226> , are you seriously trying to pass off complete bullshit as truth?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:53:43 <@!227555337945743360> , what did we tell you about that PFP, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:54:05 We told you to take it down literally today ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:54:27 Oh for **FUCK'S SAKE**, guess who told him that excuse ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:55:20 Right, <@!454083872771014658> , <@354336251551285251> , both of you just cut it out and listen for a moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:55:34 We told someone_pointless to remove the PFP after he revealed that it came from an NSFW source
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:55:54 We literally had to kick him, he came back with a fine PFP, but then changed it back, apparently sometime now
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:56:24 I told him the only reason he could use that kind of PFP is if it's something important, the excuse I gave was "Remembering dead parents"
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:56:35 Notice how he made that same excuse?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:56:48 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:57:12 For crap's sake ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:57:41 Let me guess, Mad's an alt of Dragonmage, who keeps on continuously picking on me for no other reason other than to keep on bothering me and make my life a near suicidal living hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:58:13 ... I'll keep my eye on you then <@!454083872771014658>
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:58:32 Flame, yes, of course we banned someone
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:58:55 ... Are you honestly serious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:59:02 Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:59:06 Let me put it simply to you
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:59:19 He openly admitted to taking it from an NSFW source, which we don't allow
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:59:45 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:00:10 Ta, fucking, da, openly admitted it was NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:00:45 I'm about to start taking executive action here for fuck's sake ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:01:22 Swearing's allowed, and if you haven't noticed, I'm pissed off after flashbacks of Dragonmage constantly picking on me
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:01:37 ... WFYB's dead, they have a much smaller fanbase to deal with, that's why
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:02:01 For fuck's sake ... For fuck's, fucking, sake, Flame, what are you here for, to just bug us?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:02:10 Then get out or I'll force you out
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:02:19 Very well then
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:02:36 !mute <@!264769733021270016> 1d Being here just to bug us, now get the fuck out
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:02:49 Oh wait what the fuck?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:03:23 Days are a valid timeframe for that bot in the form of (number)d, at least, for the bans and such
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:03:50 ... <@354336251551285251> , he's been doing that for a while, so it's not really censorship
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:04:11 He just consistently comes on, tries to start up a shitstorm, then leaves
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:05:12 He's trying to compare the peak of WFYB to the lowest point of Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:06:07 I can see the DMs, BayDren, he's just trying to stir up a shitstorm
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:06:13 Getting permission to show them
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:06:44 Permission granted, observe what happens with Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:06:45 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510815928754372608/522594696246329355/image0.png
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:07:18 Then tell him to quit nearly, if not completely starting arguments every single time he comes online
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:08:14 ... BayDren, did you seriously ask "whats wrong with arguments?"
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:08:22 Did you honestly, seriously ask, what's wrong with arguments
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:10:05 ... The answer is common sense, something which you seem to lack, but since you need me to enlighten you:
Arguments cause stress for both ends, especially if the person is being accused of something false, and it causes general chaos, and in a chat sense, it fills it up, rendering people unable to read the non-argument messages, which leads people to feel obliged to join in, so on and so forth, until there's a full blown server war, and I'm not saying this from speculation either.
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:11:03 I tried to get his username in the log
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:11:11 So potatoe could "message" him to pull up the DMs again
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:11:33 Apparently more shit hit the fan while we were talking
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:12:43 If you can't see it, I'll shove it through via DMs
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:13:12 That's the equivalent of saying "No numbers in the username" or "Always capitalize your sentences with proper punctuation", not gonna happen
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:14:37 Totten
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:14:44 You, don't seem to have a good grasp of what's going on
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:15:31 Sorry plzkil, wrong person
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:16:10 This, is falling into complete and total anarchy here ... god damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:16:32 Right, gonna answer totten's question first, then BayDren's
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:16:50 Wait what the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:17:14 Ah, oh yeah I nearly forgot about those
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:17:40 This is giving me a headache to be honest, riiiight, if no more chaos would happen please
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:18:33 <@354336251551285251> , if you read the fine print, the mods are technically allowed to enforce their own rules, although "have common sense" was one of the rules in the past, we removed it because we thought people could be trusted enough to not just throw a general shitstorm or something
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:19:21 <@!387803965728882689> , that's literally the tutorial VTOL that one guy made, except without the VTOL component
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:19:52 Now can the chaos please stop so I can go fucking eat? I'm getting hungry here, but I also want to try to keep this server from catching on fire
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:20:35 Two massive "tines" (spear-like points) on the front half, very tiny single block section on the rear half, with a single block wide space on the side of the tines for fitting the motors on
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:21:29 Trust me the others settle stuff, I just come in with a hammer/shotgun fusion and start whacking and blasting whoever, so I'm probably more noticable
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:21:56 Aside from a few slight modifications, it's pretty much exactly like a plane someone else made
creations-chat 2018-12-13 02:23:06 It's not uncommon, as you see by the two tines on my fighter, but you can definitely make not only the tines more distinct, but the actual craft's body and other wings more distinct as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:23:36 Hey, I said it was joking, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:23:57 Bay, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so think of how to counteract the action of the rotor blades spinning
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:24:35 Either a tail rotor or two rotors on opposite ends, like Imperial just showed
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:48:36 Exc-
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:48:39 Excuse me
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:48:44 What the hell did he say?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:49:08 What exactly did Deception say about me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:50:12 He's actually hiding from me
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 02:50:26 Am I honestly that terrifying?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 05:38:49 <@!363690935873306626>
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 05:38:54 It's that guy
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:20:37 Was that a Smash Bros joke fonkl?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:54:37 Is he giving credit for it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:09:42 Slight changes to my PFP statement in <#490306593242611742> , since people have tried using the example I posted
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:10:50 ... Which server?
creations-chat 2018-12-13 21:25:25 That's called trolling ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:28:06 ... Like, actually to do so, or are you just shitting with me like you always do sonnuy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:30:04 There, a third freaking edit because nobody's happy with that announcement even though it's common fucking sense not to do so
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:30:50 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:30:57 Go for it Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:31:04 But also, are you HONESTLY serious sonnuy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:31:14 Like, are you honestly serious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:12 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:14 Sonnuy
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:18 That one's fucking fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:22 It's not NSFW or anything like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:33 We wouldn't ask them to change it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:45 So why, do tell me, did you use that as an example?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:32:59 Not to mention, again, it's common sense, not to have an NSFW PFP, on a Roblox Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:33:46 Maybe something you're honestly lacking sonnuy, considering you apparently, as far as I can tell, want to argue tooth, nail, and claw, against me trying to re-state something that should be sensible, after someone ignored it
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:33:57 Which server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:34:29 Which VIP server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 21:34:34 Empire's or what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:40:45 Snow tires?
help 2018-12-14 03:07:46 "Flechette" "Hawker" "Dart"?
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 03:08:54 Tell him "If you're so certain that they're apparently bad, why don't you try building a game yourself, unless you're just full of toxic bullcrap"
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 03:09:08 Also, nothing we can do about that Point, not until we get in-game moderation powers
help 2018-12-14 03:10:10 It looks like an interceptor type of vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 03:10:56 He's a toxic piece of shit as it turns out, ignore him
help 2018-12-14 03:14:03 Don't confuse interceptor with destroyer by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 03:18:21 Excuse me while I find your server to beat him to fucking hell
help 2018-12-14 03:38:40 Get some form of rank
creations-chat 2018-12-14 03:53:41 Don't suggest anything stupid please
creations-chat 2018-12-14 03:53:50 (By the way, yes, that means you got your ranks)
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 04:11:04 Nowhere near fast enough
creations-chat 2018-12-14 04:40:27 Show the save slot
creations-chat 2018-12-14 06:24:31 If that's a cruiser then jesus christ my fighters are seriously oversized
creations-chat 2018-12-14 06:55:48 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:01:47 Do I win? (This thing maneuvers like a fast fighter by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:02:14 Thanks, I also landed it on Battleship's carrier, with relative ease infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:02:36 Can your F-18 fly in reverse?
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:03:11 The MK4 fighter can fly straight vertically in reverse
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:03:30 One shot on that rotor and that heli's as good as gone, infact, practically anywhere and it's gone
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:05:15 There's alot of static AA devices, it's unimpressive to say the least to be perfectly honest
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:05:36 If you want impressive, make the guns and rockets both scatter outwards upon firing
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:06:05 Show the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:06:33 I meant Flow, but, well, alright
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:07:33 I'm giving Floating Fortress early because it looks like it can fit a few well designed fighters on it
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:07:59 I've gotten pretty good with judging landing zones, and it seems like any carrier capable craft should be able to land on it
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:08:17 Use folding
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:10:55 For?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:40:47 I mean, it's not half bad, "Hammerhead"?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:41:56 I mean, I myself went from this
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:42:04 To this
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:42:32 Oh wait, I showed the older version of my MK4 fighter
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:42:41 
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:42:55 Yeah, what do you think?
creations-chat 2018-12-14 16:44:09 Yeah, so don't worry, try visualizing and building upon it
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:44:52 ... And with that humor level up, everything else, leveled down, common sense twice infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:47:45 Lore-wise they're supposed to be ripped off of cruisers and refitted to be actually usable on that thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:47:52 In-game, I don't have guns that big
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:48:02 If I did though, GG, literally everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 16:51:26 It's clean, it's just really, really distorted
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 23:38:10 ... <@!216371990959882241> , no light spamming, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 00:10:56 It's called damage in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 01:03:19 Empire's server, or?
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 01:05:45 Which server is it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 01:06:10 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 01:29:44 Yeah, uhhh, about that
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 01:30:11 Nah, just something with a similar U-shaped wing design
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:02:52 ... <@385386052719869952> , can you change your PFP please
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:03:05 Thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:03:55 Empire, I think he means just raw engine power, no magnet drives or anything like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:04:25 No magnet engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:34:21 You crashed it, RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:34:28 I froze in air, but I was still animating
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:34:34 And I was above the kill floor, so
creations-chat 2018-12-15 21:26:00 Be a bit patient next time, we all have our own lives you know
bug-reports 2018-12-15 21:32:58 Well, as long as Imperial's fine with it being copied, else, erase it, now
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 21:33:24 I'd say no, but just to put it on the safe side, erase it
creations-chat 2018-12-15 22:55:12 Seems like he tried to copy, especially considering the general nose/cockpit shape, engine positioning, and dual rotor style
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 22:55:52 Train track seems to work pretty well
creations-chat 2018-12-15 22:56:16 How much you wanna bet he's tealur?
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:01:08 You need to sort it out, and it's up to the mods' decision, followed by the original owner
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:01:36 If it's something highly cloneable, like a 10 part plane, no issue, if you copy a 1K part plane bit by bit, you're done
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:02:35 If the other person allows it, it's not really copying now is it?
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:46:48 Looks like a stubby space shuttle thing made for combat, pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:49:36 Not a problem, do note: The 3 important things in fighting other fighters are maneuverability (Can be compensated for by a high amount of speed), durability, and firepower (Specifically how you arrange them)
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:50:17 For ground vehicle, it's speed (can't be compensated for by maneuverability sadly), firepower, and durability, specifically downwards facing rockets or a good aim
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:51:32 I use keyboard controls
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:51:44 Mouse controls only work with control surfaces, and at higher speeds
creations-chat 2018-12-15 23:52:01 But at those speeds, combat is impossible, due to the fact that by the time you're properly pointed at something, it's whizzed by already
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:00:22 A simpler idea might be coordinates, that way you don't get a 3d map, but you get a general idea of where you're at
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:01:52 God damn it <@205404956759556096> , you started a shark craze!
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:02:00 Now everyone's making sharks of all sort
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:02:35 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:03:15 You mean the music one?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:13:26 Tips jar, only connects on the base, drops coins if tilted upside-down, and each tipjar you buy earns 1 jar
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:13:59 Then do the other thing, I can't remember what it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:14:07 But it's a gamepass that you can buy over and over
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:16:13 Just put one of those in, I saw another guy do something like that and it sold like freaking hotcakes (Also had to go afk very slightly, hence why I'm typing this late)
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:41:34 Want a rank for that <@!442355784018558976> ?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:42:32 Alright, show save slots then
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:43:43 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:44:25 Done, you have your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-16 00:45:07 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:56:03 So many sharks, god damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 00:56:43 I guess they got bored and harassed enough?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:10:47 Keken, question, does it fly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:11:16 Then that's your first goal Keken, make it fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:11:37 It looks great, but you need wings and crap, or helium, to make it fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:11:58 Actually, I just realized, zero gravity fighters are far easier to make, just need to balance helium and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:12:35 Go for it Keken
help 2018-12-16 01:14:26 <@!484363661121421332> , currently multi-crew and group build functionalities are planned for the future, but they aren't added yet, be patient
creations-chat 2018-12-16 01:15:16 I'm just gonna erase that for safety's sake
help 2018-12-16 01:16:02 Eventually it'll be added
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:17:27 It's up to you Keken
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:06 I mean, I took the opposite approach, using absolutely zero helium, I just have a policy against using it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:14 No helium, no ballasts, no nothing
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:33 Keken, just mess around with it, we won't really be able to help
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:18:50 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:21:00 Not actually true Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:21:06 It worked just fine with helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:21:22 Infact, if anything, it was very fun to fly around with helium, no issues with maneuverability
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:21:37 Just need to layer it out properly rather than focus it near the nose, rear or sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:22:20 Makes me think of a Cylon Raider, it's pretty cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:23:26 It won't float perfectly, but you'll get very, VERY close
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:23:54 I've personally gotten close enough that it'd take the heat death of the universe to finally touch the ground after like 2-3 taps
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:26:32 CoM is Center of Mass, but Center of F?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:26:52 ... F and L are literally about 4 keys away from eachother on a standard QWERTY keyboard
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:28 No way to cram that into anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:35 Doom, even a megacarrier won't work
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:47 You'd need someone to break it into 4 pieces
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:55 A front, rear, and two sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 02:13:37 Wrong way around Empire
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 02:13:45 Time then reason
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 02:30:21 Okay, enough with the freaking GTA planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 02:30:33 I think the chat's sorta choking with them now
help 2018-12-16 02:33:11 Get a rank, that's how
general 2018-12-16 03:20:00 Ehhh, maybe in a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 05:22:43 Can't do anything about it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:03:23 Look at your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:32 Is it 500+ parts?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:45 Ah, nevermind Yoko
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:47 I see it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:04:51 Give me a moment linh
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:06:33 Ehhhh, to be honest it looks fairly blocky, make the fuselage rounder, drag out the nose or add something more distinct
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:13 Maybe mix up the color scheme and it might help
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:34 I'm on "me time", but I'll let you see something that counts for modeler
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:08:42 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:09:09 Er, whops, sorry Yoko
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:09:24 Fixed it Tornado
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:00 Not a problem, if you need any ranking, contact me (with proof) and you're pretty much garunteed a rank (when I'm on)
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:13 Mind showing the save slot?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:32 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:10:48 Also I think it's time to revise the builder role to have the double limitation for both land and sea
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:11:17 I'll give it to you anyways because it seems like you did put alot of effort and detail into it
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:12:08 Anyways, you can check out my fighter for something like modeler, I posted a screenshot but cleared it out of <#384025409945337856> , since I already posted it there
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:14:22 I'd say it's easy, considering you can stockpile creations and just vomit them all at once and grab all the roles
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:14:35 So no special rank for grabbing a ton of ranks at one time
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 06:15:17 Good effing god those looks nice, uhhh, check half blocks, see if any are adjacent
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:15:47 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363606144483338/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:15:47 What's more impressive: This
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:16:10 Back before jet engines were nerfed (I think so at least), this thing could fly and drop all the bombs
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:16:21 The refitted version should be able to carry the bombs easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 06:16:37 Again, looks like a Cylon Raider, pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:02 You may notice those blocks are yellow, and none of the blocks are painted
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:14 And if you think thoroughly, you may realize that ballasts start off yellow
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:31 Yoko, biggest issue with helis: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
creations-chat 2018-12-16 06:17:36 Solve that and you can make a heli
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:13:13 Ahem <@!164043964834512907>
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:13:20 We have chat logs you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:13:41 ... Try that crud again and I'm gonna nuke you to kingdom come, okay?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:14:38 __***NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE BASICALLY BANNED, GOT IT***__, but seriously though, don't try it, we have kids in this channel
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:15:07 And if any of you argue "But Discord ToS", I'm just going to ignore it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:15:29 There's a reason I mentioned "we have kids in this channel"
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:15:45 Yes he erased it, no that doesn't forgive him for what he did
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:16:08 Shrimp, can you not, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:16:13 Shhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:16:19 Potatoe, what do you think I poped on for?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:16:47 It's fine, just don't let it circulate and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:17:03 Kratos, Lior, Shrimp, can we just forget about this and move on?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:17:43 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:17:51 Who the heck do you think I mean?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:18:47 <@!164043964834512907> , keep your freaking opinion to yourself if you don't mind, already had to gun down a few people because they started a "furry vs anti-furry" war on this Discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:19:20 At the very least make it polite and obvious that it's your opinion
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:19:43 This is a __***ROBLOX***__ Discord, we get the ass end of the internet spectrum here, what do you think?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:20:08 ........
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:20:20 I'm, going to erase that and pretend you didn't say anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:21:09 <@!164043964834512907> , people's prolonged innocence is sometimes the best gift you can give them
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:22:03 Drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:47 Try hitting someone with it
bug-reports 2018-12-16 17:22:53 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:23:15 That's called chaos and anarchy
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:23:17 ....
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:23:21 Combine, you're really pushing my patience here
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:23:43 Read, the freaking, rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:23:54 Again, we have kids here, this is a Roblox Discord, so act as such
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:24:53 If you actually have to worry about being incorrectly banned for spam, then no offense, this is my opinion, but you need to change your typing style to a more compact one, where everything's in one big line
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:25:20 When you think about it, it's not an issue if your chat's somewhat compact, sure it's somewhat harder to read through, but still
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:25:30 Now then, <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , probably <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:26:18 ... Soorrrrta, mind heading over to <#497142796961054721> if we're going to continue like this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:26:50 Alright, then please try to keep this chat about Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:27:04 No Combine, I mean it's my opinion, and you can take it or leave it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:27:36 Because it usually trails on for a crapton of time after an argument and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:28:05 Can't exactly control that stuff easily now can ya?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:28:33 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:28:54 Alright, want us to start with you 3 then? (We're not actually going to FYI)
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:29:23 .... Just, stop if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:29:45 Yes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:30:27 ... Doom, if this is just to keep me here indefinitely then can you please just can it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:31:09 You need to claim historical accuracy, but I suppose so in that particular case
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:31:47 And you can't just paint a random swastika and go "Historical accuracy!", you actually need to build a real WW2 replica, that's easily distinguished as said WW2 replica
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:32:20 Looks pretty nice so far
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:32:33 ONLY for historical accuracy, spam them around the place and if it's within our power we'll ban you
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:33:20 Good example: You're allowed a swastika on an ME-262, as shown in this image
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:33:21 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Messerschmitt_Me_262A_at_the_National_Museum_of_the_USAF.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:33:47 Try to put a swastika on a Boeing however and we'll blast you into oblivion
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:34:01 And it needs to be easily recognizable as said craft
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:34:12 Shrimp, not quite
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:34:40 So long as it's a German WW2 plane that featured it, and you can find proof that it's had it, and it's easily recognizable to the image you used, then yes, you can
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:34:46 Also, what do you mean Kratos?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:13 PFFFF, you don't realy need to ask that Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:14 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:40 Right, that's it, one more thing about NSFW from you three <@!484363661121421332> <@456226577798135808> <@!164043964834512907> and I'm giving a warn and a mute, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:46 Prov, no idea, I don't think it's helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:52 By low speed what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:36:38 So, basically you go up, and you seem to just hit a ceiling and slow down to 27 and glide?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:37:19 If you're still using jets for a boeing like the ones we have, I pity your brain's lack of neurons, seriously, have you seen the size of these things?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:37:44 Unless it's MADE of jet engines (Not rocket engines, there's a difference), then it won't work
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:37:50 But anyways, hmmm, show us Prov?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:38:18 Get a video and pump it through a gif converter if you can
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:38:41 Ask me through DMs
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:41:26 Linh, tell them "If you make tiny low quality creations, then of course you're going to need more slots, build bigger and more awesome"
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:41:42 Also point out the save data limit, and how most people with around 400-500 block creations in each slots have full slots
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:42:03 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:14 God damn, that actually looks very nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:27 Alot more simplistic than my version to be fully honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:37 Wait wait wait that's your airliner Prov?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:48 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:44:15 Linh, 2 things, 1: How fast does it maneuver, 2: 420 level, pulling up or diving?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:44:39 My MK4 fighter does about 440 pulling straight up
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:44:51 Er, that's not a good indicator on how maneuverable it is Linh
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:44:55 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:45:09 Then get more people to play Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:47:26 They're covering up your landing gears aren't they?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:47:33 Flip them around
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:48:04 They ask it quite a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:48:06 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:48:40 If you two start a fight, don't forget, you've got a very active mod watching over you two, so behave
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:49:01 I've seen fights started over harmless things like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:50:05 .......
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:51:41 Unless you're talking about Plane Crazy, can you please just move to <#497142796961054721> with this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:52:12 That way we can keep the channels at least **SOMEWHAT** organized instead of chaotic, so newly joined people have an easier time keeping track
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:54:24 Slowmode is a system where if people spam alot, it automatically forces them to stop chatting
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:54:53 Well don't spam and we won't have to use it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:55:20 Remember, compact and long chat has little to no risk of b eing seen as spam, however, multiple small "bursts" have a very high chance of being seen as such
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:55:27 Kratos, I can already tell the center of lift is way too far back
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:56:04 Shrimp, you don't have to have the seat exposed
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:56:09 The main pilot seat teleports you to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:56:45 A seat occupies a 1X1X3 space, I can see where he put it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:57:26 Wait, let me check
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:57:54 Yeah, make that 1X1X2
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:59:08 Remember: Copying is NOT allowed, as it causes alot of grief for the person that was copied, so unless you have direct permission from the original owner, DO NOT COPY
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:59:25 Alright
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:01:01 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:01:46 By tracks, do you mean genuine tracks, "tracks", or wheels?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:02:01 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:02:13 Probably too many motors, Roblox has been acting funny recently, so blame them, not us
general 2018-12-16 18:03:29 Can you confirm this through screenshots?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:03:43 You can't ping everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:03:57 Also please confirm through screenshots beforehand
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:15:33 If someone built a real life credit card with a fake number and stuff, that'd probably count for modeler to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:16:28 Then you're gonna run out of money very fast
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:16:32 And that's highly illegal
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:17:57 I think some of them are dead, although if all of them are dead then that's Roblox's problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:18:10 Not EVERY single server is going to die simultaneously
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:18:49 They SHOULD be, if not then I don't know, blame Roblox
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:20:41 How about I prepare a cyberdemon in retaliation?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:32:36 How would that even work wotazio?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:34:01 Eh, I was thinking someone would place down beacons or something and make a path for others to take
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:34:16 Then everyone races in a tournament style, 1v1, until a winner is determined
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:37:50 I sorta want an air race, everyone builds their own custom racers, a voluntary craft (or pair of crafts, maybe 4) line out the race boundaries with anchors and beacons and crud, and everyone races
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:40:28 Admittedly planes beat out boats and cars in races
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:41:24 What about a handicap race? You have a minimum and maximum of each block you can use, for example: Minimum of 3 max weight ballasts, maximum of 1 super rocket and 4 regular rockets, no control surfaces
general 2018-12-16 18:42:00 <@296280922771292170> , <@!263959626804887552> , AHEEEEMMM!!!!!
general 2018-12-16 18:42:14 This is a Roblox server linked to the game
general 2018-12-16 18:42:19 Discord rules apply in-game
general 2018-12-16 18:42:31 And it's common fucking sense not to post NSFW stuff, or stuff that's supposed to mimic NSFW stuff
general 2018-12-16 18:42:54 How about "No, fuck you", but on a less rude note, that's basically asking a sherriff to shoot us with a M1911
general 2018-12-16 18:43:05 So, __***NO***__
general 2018-12-16 18:44:31 It's literally in the rules in your face, and it's literally common sense
general 2018-12-16 18:44:44 Not Safe For Work
general 2018-12-16 18:45:03 Aka: "Bits", if you get what it means, then you're not as innocent as you think, if you don't get it, don't, delve into it anymore
general 2018-12-16 18:45:14 Trust me, you don't wanna know if you don't already know
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:45:27 That's actually really freaking cool
general 2018-12-16 18:47:34 That's literally the channel for memes, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:50:38 Empire, your Carolina vs my MK4, which do you think would win?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:51:25 DOHF-
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:51:36 CALIFORNIA, NOT CAROLINA, jesus effing christ, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 18:51:41 Trying to multitask like 10 things here
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:38:10 Yoko, self-upvotes are really, really redundant, since obviously everyone wants themselves to always win
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:39:36 Hell, if you really wanna get into stuff like that, the bot's upvote doesn't count either, since that one's only to make it obvious for others
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:42:51 To punish one person <@!168154760866693120> , is a start, not stupidity, if you don't start somewhere, you never arrive anywhere
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:43:45 Fine, then we'll change the ranks so every single rank requires 2 extra upvotes, 1 for the self-vote, 1 for the bot vote, and then those that don't upvote themselves will get fucked, *sounds good?*
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:44:57 So in other words you're upvoting yourself in order to bias other people to upvote you as well ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:31 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:45:46 That is literally what you said Yoko
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:46:12 You post something, upvote it, others see it's upvoted, they want to join on  the bandwagon unfairly
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:46:25 That's literally what you're describing in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:46:36 Because Lucky, it's highly unfair to do something like that ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:46:49 Then what the hell is that point?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:47:36 ... Again, if we don't start somewhere, we don't arrive anywhere
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:47:38 So I suppose a start now's better than doing nothing at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:49:26 This still invalidates more than just your own vote, considering you're trying to bias others to upvote your own creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:49:55 <@!319216576286949379> , freaking TMI for crap's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 20:50:43 ... Fuck it, you deal with this fucking shit Empire, watch every creation get botted upvotes now
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:03:26 Already planned, now be patient for it if you'd please
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:03:55 <@!360770826884087818> , it's ALREADY PLANNED, not to mention you need an actual rank to prove you're not just a random troll
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:04:38 Some people don't bother looking at <#507673335816126509> to see if their suggestions are there and they wind up literally suggesting the same exact thing that was suggested before them
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:04:47 In one case I remember it was almost word for word
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:06:45 Ask Empire and the others to do it, I'm honestly pissed to hell after something that happened
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:07:32 19 separate results for whitelisting
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:07:49 And that's just searching up "whitelist", there's "team build" "coop" and so on
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:08:15 Let me guess, I'd demolish people?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:08:26 Like with this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:10:19 Actually, it's up to you in the end, but Rick, I'd suggest doing a vote, "Should I postpone all future updates to work on whitelisting, resulting in a very long span of no updates, possibly for months, or continue working on updates and working on whitelisting when planned"
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:10:32 Probably too limiting
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:10:41 People would just build turrets and tanks and such
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:11:13 You have no idea how much crap I crammed into my fighters
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:11:45 Can we not treat <#384021699466756107> like <#495286269459300364> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:13:43 It was for stuff about the actual game it's self
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:14:27 ... <@!484363661121421332> , drag it here and I will fucking draw a ban card on you, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:15:25 RIP, Roblox isn't happy is it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:16:21 WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WHAT THE HELL GRAB!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:16:47 Ah, Acj's?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:16:56 He ain't in the server

creations-chat 2018-12-16 23:49:24 So tons of hidden engines?
creations-chat 2018-12-16 23:50:13 Ah, mine has a (redacted, just know it's large) amount of engines for pitch, yaw and roll
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 23:51:48 <@227590705286086659> , Aaahheeeeemmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:04:52 Nexia, you're having your rank debated, could you try making an extension off of that mechanism?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:05:27 People say that orbital stuff have been made before
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:05:34 So could you try making a moon for that planet?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:05:54 Also, that asshole we just banned, they blew up <#504630451579781121> and <#504630474853974032>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:07:05 Then whatever the orbiting thing is you made
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:07:28 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:07:30 OHF
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:07:31 Wrong guy

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:12:21 Sorry Ajc, it's under debate after Orange pointed to evidence that it may've been done before
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:12:39 Yeah, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:12:42 Maybe try adding another piece to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:20:34 Ahem, rule 2 Aero
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 00:20:44 Specifically at the second bar

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:13:40 I will honestly turn you into a "cold" corpse (in a server sense) if you don't cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:14:45 <@!278840809384837122> , simply put if you don't know it, you won't get it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:14:58 <@!363824929705164802> , I've danced this god damn dance before, you seriously wanna try me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:15:22 He changed it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:15:31 Empire flyswatted him down and he changed it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:15:37 Then he was trying to make NSFW jokes
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:15:45 About TOYSTORY OF ALL THE GOD DAMN THINGS
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:16:10 ... I could've warned you twice, but I decided once, but fuck it, gonna retract that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:17:05 IGNORE THAT, whops, I'm tired
the-dump 2018-12-17 03:18:02 <@!260534086400081920> , SERIOUSLY DUDE!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:18:26 Trust me, I am very, very forgiving
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:19:02 Ehhhh, nah, it's good PR to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:19:59 ... Seriously <@!278840809384837122> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:20:42 <@!278840809384837122> , because the first one he changed, which is understandable, plus why don't you shout at Empire for not bugging him?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:20:50 <@!363824929705164802> , what do you mean exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:31 After we had a recent NSFW bot raid, we shut it down hard
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:41 ... <@!278840809384837122> , you wouldn't happen to be C4RAB, would you?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:55 He always whined about the mod team, even when they were being highly active
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:21:59 ... Yes, they were coldct
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:22:03 Keep in mind, there are literally kids here
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:22:35 Go for it Jr, just don't spam stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:22:42 <@!251995895405477888> , I already fixed his unfair downvotes
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:02 Just try it again and see what happens JrBlack
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:19 Doom, then take your time, be active, call over mods and crap, so on and so forth
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:31 Coldct, if you even try that, so help me I've got a ban command on the hotline aimed at you
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:23:42 I already did JrBlack
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:24:18 You can post thumbnails as long as they are well within the SFW zone
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:24:37 ... Not, quite what I meant JrBlack
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:24:49 I meant planes that you have built within Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:25:00 Because it's LITERALLY THE LAW COLDCT
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:25:28 Now unless you want a sheriff sending you a cease and desist <@!363824929705164802> , I would suggest you don't mention it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:25:48 And yes, that genuinely happened to a guy I know for this exact same scenario
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:26:06 <@!264873879640604673> , read the rules, rule 1, specifically on the swearing front, is a bit more flexible
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:26:43 <@!363824929705164802> , don't even try it, let's just forget about it
creations-chat 2018-12-17 03:27:06 Not half bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:27:48 ... <@!264873879640604673> , just because you're part of an ethnic group doesn't excuse you from the punishments and fallout of being racially aggressive
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:28:18 You literally tried downvoting every single creation just for the hell of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:29:17 Do I need to point out this?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:29:37 "im no troublemkaer!!!!!!" you really are to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:29:39 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:29:46 <@!363824929705164802> , one more time, and I swear
creations-chat 2018-12-17 03:30:10 He's showing off the thumbnail, not the actual creation, and presumably he built it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:30:35 Tornado, do you mind?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:31:08 ... Unless you're talking about Plane Cray directly, or something that affects Plane Crazy, can we **PLEASE** all move to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 03:32:06 Alright, provide a link and I might check it out, maybe even ask for a showcase on some crafts
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:32:27 <@!264873879640604673> , but it's not a Plane Crazy plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:32:47 Not unless you build them in-game
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:33:13 Now then, if you don't mind, quit making it worse and worse and please, drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , before I shut down <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:33:35 Empire, leave it to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:33:51 Ahem, riiight, now then
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:33:59 !slowmode 5m
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:34:02 Crap
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:34:22 Now drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> please
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:34:26 CLOSE ENOUGH
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:34:47 Give it a moment and hopefully they'll dissipate
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:35:12 I'll disable it once it's 10:38 (it's 10:35 right now), you have my word, so please be patient
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:38:23 Now means **NOW**, or please leave the server temporarily
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:38:32 If you can't, here's the door
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:39:08 Then he'll just have to wait ten minutes until he comes back
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:39:17 He's the one that decided to be an inappropriate little piece of shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:39:30 And the name ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:39:52 __***AND THE NAME <@!363824929705164802> ***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:40:14 It was still an inappropriate name, for fuuuuuck's sake ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:40:18 Yes, he did, he rejoined after the PFP
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:40:25 But he didn't change the name
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:40:38 Alright that's it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:41:00 No, you'll stay out until you can change, which, from what we know, is about 10 minutes, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:42:00 Fuuuucking hell today was eventful
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:42:36 If he does I'll bark at Potatoe or Xpert to drop the hammer on his face
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:45:14 No jokes about autism please ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:45:24 Moreso for my sake this time if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:50:14 __**EXCUSE ME!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:50:15 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:50:46 AHEM
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:50:50 We can and will change the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:51:00 And if you abuse it, we can and will beat you out of it and into oblivion
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:51:19 And since this is tied to the actual Plane Crazy game <@!471881268192215051> , we can and will ban you from the actual game
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:51:21 RIP
bug-reports 2018-12-17 03:51:34 Convert it to a gif if you'd please
bug-reports 2018-12-17 03:51:47 .wmv files are notoriously susceptible to hidden viruses
bug-reports 2018-12-17 03:51:55 Just show it to us in any way that we don't have to download it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:52:15 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:52:27 Just, leave it to me, back up a bit if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:52:50 <@!471881268192215051> , you're pushing the boundaries, alot, and those are there for a reason, for a very, very good reason
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 03:53:08 For FUCK'S SAKE GUYS ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:31:40 It was coldct again
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:32:06 Wait, oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:32:11 Well, he did try to join on an alt
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:32:52 I don't know, I'm just tired of his back and forward stuff to be honest, and quite frankly, if I'm being too brutal, sorry, but I've stopped caring after literally everyone told me not to care
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:33:08 Yeah, and if you guys fuck it up again **I'M** going to burn it down this time, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:40:43 You need a rank, <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:52:39 <#519624169730605086>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 05:52:59 Don't suggest anything stupid
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 05:53:52 It should be fine now, I had to tweak it a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:36:15 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:36:22 <@456226577798135808> , change the PFP if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:36:29 No it's not NSFW, but it's cutting it very close
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:37:20 "No it's not NSFW, but it's cutting it very close"
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:37:21 That's why
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:37:41 Now could you please change it to something more appropriate for what's basically a kids Discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:38:33 I was thinking you'd pull up the "Discord Terms of Service" card, but that's close enough, trust me there are some people that really enjoy tough stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:38:49 Your current one's, well, fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:39:22 True, but ricardo (I'm assuming that's the previous dancing one) was barely doing so
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:40:15 ... For the love of god, do you want to be the third guy banned for close to, if not entirely NSFW crap?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:40:33 Then can we please drop it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:40:57 Then let's just drop it and get back to some form of conversation about Plane Crazy, or move to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:41:15 And if you're wondering, the rules still apply in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:41:24 Er, moderator, but still
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:41:40 ... He's just trying to help
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:41:58 Alright, <@456226577798135808> , just try to not let the jokes run too far
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:42:17 ... How about I throw a fighter at you in retaliation?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:42:30 Alright, let's see
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:42:42 And if you're wondering, no this is not an art piece, it genuinely flies very well
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:43:54 Except structural integrity, a sense of fashion, extreme speed and an extreme amount of maneuverability
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:44:48 ... Are we seriously going to do this now? You should take a hint, that I really don't enjoy mass joking around
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:45:04 .......
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:46:41 Fuck, ing, hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:47:12 He typed out the first burst (before the "you really aren't statement") in 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:48:18 Thaaaat's it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:49:32 To pull up the statement I made from before: "I don't know, I'm just tired of his back and forward stuff to be honest, and quite frankly, if I'm being too brutal, sorry, but I've stopped caring after literally everyone told me not to care"
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:49:39 As you wish rick, I'll get on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:49:51 !unban @jordan#9398
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:49:57 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:50:20 !unban <488456801210204193>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:50:26 Daahhh, hmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:51:20 I did block him, how much do you want to bet we have another Dragonmage on here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:52:48 So something like "<@!488456801210204193>"?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:52:51 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 20:53:14 Done
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:55:35 He's continuing to be toxic, to Rick of all people
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:57:07 Started off rolling in with a near NSFW gif, then tried to s tart an argument, followed by being absurdly toxic
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:57:38 Dunno, ask Xpert, he's the one that sets up this stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:57:51 DON'T, ping him though
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:58:10 Shove the question somewhere and hope it gets noticed?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:58:21 Just, ask away and I'll cram it into the mod chat and hope he sees it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:59:27 Temp, temp, perma
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:00:06 Show the vehicles alongside them if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:01:07 Done, and your ranks are now organized to
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:01:18 Blame Roblox, not us
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:01:32 Roblox screwed something up and it's been happening on other games (at least from what I've experienced) as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:01:57 Alright, well all we can do is hope it starts working again
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:02:00 Yes <@!219175600609296394> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:02:50 Oh ouch, huh
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:02:56 It's the Malevolence
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:03:06 <@!219175600609296394> , you're gonna need another person to finish it in another part
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:03:24 There's no way, no matter how much folding you do, that you're going to finish it in one piece
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:03:59 Not half bad, now with your rank, don't suggest anything stupid please, always check <#507673335816126509> before suggesting your own idea, as it is likely already in there
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:05:21 You have a superior rank due to the airliner and double requirements on buses
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:07:39 Well, you'll still get the other ranks, but you need both upvotes and for it to be based off of a real life object for it to be replicator
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:09:12 Pretty cool, rough estimate of parts: 140-160ish
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:09:36 Mind posting a picture of the save slot? You'll still get other applicable ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:10:12 Done, please examine <#507673335816126509> for your suggestion before attempting to suggest something, and please suggest things that will help everyone, not just yourself
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:13:17 Good point, thanks for pointing it out
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:16:51 Steampunk engineer are for blimp-like creations, ones that float with zero upwards thrusters (aside from slight maneuvers)
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:17:13 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:20:01 It's fine, enjoy being a sub commander
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:20:26 Estimating around 500 parts with large part usage, maybe upwards of 1-1.5K with medium/small part usage
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:21:11 Ohf- I was off for sure
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:21:41 Folding, that's how, it's an ancient technique dated a long long time ago
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:21:55 Yeup
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:22:43 Hello_TheLastGamersYT
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:23:18 That's one of the smaller folding creations by the way, largest I've seen is 4K, and that's only a single plot creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:24:07 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:24:11 That's your help <@323414243074506763>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:26:04 Bit scrunched up, but not half bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:26:37 I bet I'll survive it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:27:36 Hey, I was lagging at the time, not to mention when I go slow it doesn't care
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:28:01 Wings are too thick for an X-wing, but it looks really nice
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:28:17 Also, if I had to guess, the Osprey's around 200, 350 parts?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:28:47 Ahahaahh, I improved my internet! Your lag machines have no effect on my glorious Dragon fighter
help 2018-12-17 21:29:14 Welds will still apply to blocks attached on motors, be aware of that
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:29:31 Well we can't see the back so we can't tell how long it is
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:29:40 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:30:04 Nice fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:30:20 Mind posting save slots? That way we can give you your ranks
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:32:14 Why does everyone name their fighters "Wyvern"?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:32:23 Nope, that's why I suggested it
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:32:48 Enjoy being able to suggest
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:33:03 Also, read over the pins please
help 2018-12-17 21:33:45 Use various blocks, including wedges, half blocks, and more, in order to prevent the weld
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:35:09 Not bad, but I see you had issues with pitch, yaw, etc
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:35:23 Check <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:36:33 May I introduce the MK4 fighter, the Dragon?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:36:49 This thing maneuvers on a dime by the way
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:37:06 I've already put a claim on Asteria for a future build
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:38:10 I sense alot of crashing and exploding with it?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:38:48 Your center of lift would be REALLY far back, if it's even halfway existent on that thing
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:40:17 Go for it
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:40:50 <@323414243074506763> , you need upvotes to get replicator ranks for the Osprey
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:41:07 **NO .WMVS, WE'VE HAD A VIRUS ATTACK FROM ONE BEFORE**
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:41:23 Sorry, it's just, again, we got a virus attack from a .wmv file before
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:41:43 A .wmv is the standard Roblox way of recording
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:41:49 Please punch it through a GIF converter or Youtube or something
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:43:20 Ah, you use auto controls?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:43:44 That's why it doesn't just faceplant into the ground right off the start
help 2018-12-17 21:44:06 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, that's the most help I can give without beating you on the head with the answer
help 2018-12-17 21:44:31 Add helium to the top and ballasts at the bottom
help 2018-12-17 21:44:41 That way it'll auto self-right
help 2018-12-17 21:45:19 Also, Ahem <@!260534086400081920> , remember that joke in <#495286269459300364> , about the DM stuff?
help 2018-12-17 21:45:34 Ballasts are heavier than normal blocks, with adjustable crud
help 2018-12-17 21:45:50 Please don't share anything like that if you don't mind, and if you can, absolutely verify someone's of age
help 2018-12-17 21:46:04 Just try it out until it works <@!260534086400081920>
help 2018-12-17 21:46:15 You don't need a perfect ratio to make it work
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:46:51 More like flying fortress, nice
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:47:23 500-800 parts?
help 2018-12-17 21:47:55 It's surprisingly easy, as you don't need it to float, you only need it to balance
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:48:04 Ah, I REALLY overestimated
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:48:20 Then again those interior sections are hollow behind the walls
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:48:52 Triforfcing?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:49:29 What do you mean? Give an example?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:50:29 Basically less wedges = more health, or?
help 2018-12-17 21:50:36 How can I help?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:51:11 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:51:53 Doesn't apply in Plane Crazy, as the only projectile that affects multiple blocks are rockets, which 1: Are near worthless in airborne combat, and 2: Dislodge the block no matter the status condition, rather than damage or "destroy" the block
help 2018-12-17 21:52:36 It sounds like a "you need to experiment" problem, although it shouldn't be too hard
help 2018-12-17 21:53:02 Use sharper wedges near the nose, curve it out with shorter ones near the middle, and sharpen it again near the top until it's flat
help 2018-12-17 21:53:16 If you want it to open up, good luck is all I can say
general 2018-12-17 21:54:07 OY, <@!488011346974081054> , can you please cut it out?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:54:31 Until new guns come out I'm using the MK3
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:54:43 Currently running 0 losses with this thing
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:55:13 As you can see, it's damage margin is, absolutely, insane
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:55:53 And it's still a bitey little piece of crud, even with all of that damage
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:56:13 It actually isn't
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:56:28 This is what happened when a rocket directly hit the "spinal" area, as I call it
help 2018-12-17 21:56:38 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:57:07 Right behind the cockpit
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:57:38 <@!348558315086675969> , you have to build your own ladders, as (as far as I know), any smaller and the ladders will not work
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 21:58:12 I'd say use half blocks if you're worried about aerodynamics
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:58:42 GG on that front
creations-chat 2018-12-17 21:59:00 Anyways, the MK3's durability is very impressive isn't it?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:30 1X1 blocks and wing panels have as much health as a 1X7 beam or a 1X4 wing panel
help 2018-12-17 22:00:45 It's your issue sadly
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:56 Don't blame me for this idea!
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:00:59 And I believe so
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:01:23 Yes, we mentioned it T4CT
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:01:57 I think 1X1s are stronger against guns (Which you'll mostly want to use), but weaker against missiles (You sorta don't want to use these)
help 2018-12-17 22:02:27 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:02:47 Hmmm, no idea <@!219175600609296394>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:03:02 I'd say just go 1X1
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:04:42 Pfff, good call deleting that LastGame
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:05:35 Er, don't ask
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:07:55 Pretty cool, but dear god that's going to be a bitch to make fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:08:12 Wait it's finished already?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:08:28 Ah, so far so good, but you need to give it more personality
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:08:46 As it stands now it just feels like your standard mook ship (+1 if you know what that's from)
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:08:59 No there's no aerodynamics, but aerodynamic properties don't hurt
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:09:00 Nope
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:09:10 But you can simulate it by balancing hover blocks and not adding wing parts
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:09:32 A perfectly balanced craft will take the heat death of the universe to gain/loose 10 vertical speed
help 2018-12-17 22:09:48 You want it VTOL hovering or helium hovering?
help 2018-12-17 22:10:21 Add helium to the top, add ballasts at the bottom, add rocket engines to the top and give it a spin
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:10:31 T4CT, we always could with folding
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:10:54 But sadly if you're talking about one-piece creations like my MK4 Dragon, no
help 2018-12-17 22:11:12 Ever notice how a little toy top just refuses to fall over until it stops spinning?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:11:39 We don't have one-piece creations of that giant size (jorgensen's creation) yet
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:12:29 Very, very, very long
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:12:38 Are you fishing jorgensen?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:13:17 Let's hope you don't find a Ghost Leviathan
help 2018-12-17 22:15:16 Seriously? Huh, even with all the things I said?
help 2018-12-17 22:16:25 Well, think of how an arrow works, and simulate it in here, there's a force near the center, but the tail's being dragged backwards
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:16:55 Well you succeeded, you managed to get one of my friends, who hates engineering, to invest about a whole day's worth of time out of a week at one point
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:17:19 In other words, 24 out of their 168 hours for the week
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:18:04 Not every single game, but 99.9999% of them (at least on Roblox)
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:20:00 Honestly, I don't think a tip jar or something of the sort would be really immoral at this point (I've seen people in the past claim they're just "tip jars", which give added benifits, such as extra map votes per purchase and such)
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:20:25 Nothing, but I think your area might be under maintenance or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:22:48 I think a reaper must've bit the line
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:25:33 That's one thing we talked about, only connects to the base, so you can't use it as a fancy joint, it's basically just a tiny flag to stick on your vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:25:48 Uhhhhh, back away from it slowly
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:25:58 I think it's gained sentience
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:26:21 Imperial, your boeing's made of adamantium for crud's sake, of course it can be split in half and still fly
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:26:39 Well, er, yeah actually that makes sense
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:27:15 Also this is <#498473314445033472> , but we aren't talking about a bug, oh hey look a ladybug, nevermind
bug-reports 2018-12-17 22:27:16 https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/animals/Bugs/H-P/ladybug-leaf.ngsversion.1396530840848.jpg
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:30:23 Oy, none of those jokes if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:32:51 Same with mine, although they're smaller for sure, they're still combat-capable after all of that
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:33:03 They don't just putter home after all of that damage, they can still fight pretty viciously
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:36:49 Seems like Imperial wants a hug
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:51:19 That's pretty cool
creations-chat 2018-12-17 22:51:40 They were correct, it seems to fit better
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:52:42 Why is there absolutely zero love for scifi creations?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:52:51 Well, very insignificant amounts
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:54:27 I mean, scifi as in like straight scifi, not "slightly future tech"
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:54:45 Yeup, flies really well to
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:55:02 A Y-wing does count, but it's already been made
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:55:08 We mean original scifi crud
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:55:13 Sorta like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:55:29 Actually nevermind, yeah, definitely like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:55:50 Meh, that kind of craft was planned for, so it's only slightly futuristic
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:56:31 Definitely scifi
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:56:47 Original designs like you can take inspiration off the internet, but you can't copy it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:57:25 Good example: This craft took inspiration from this video game craft
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:57:26 https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/enigmata/images/8/81/Illinear.png/revision/latest?cb=20130409122928
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:57:42 You can see the similarities, but there's definitely some differences
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:58:00 Try to add personality to it and not make it really square and blocky by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 22:59:05 Hey, it doesn't HAVE to perform well in PVP you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:00:41 This thing's not blocky and yet it has never lost a public fight before
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:01:57 Trust me it's got a huge target profile on the top and bottom, which is probably one of the major flaws of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:02:19 But it compensates for it by clocking about 500 (490?) speed, and being able to turn within the primary spawn's diameter
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:03:00 It's also got reverse thrust and equal maneuverability while going full throttle or zero throttle
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:03:31 And if you're skilled enough, you can use the reverse thrust to enhance your maneuvering as well, basically flip towards your target
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:04:02 It's literally a reverse thruster
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:04:21 Is it yours jorgensen?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:06:35 OY OY OY OY OY <@!209371454632886272>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:06:41 None of that
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:07:21 ... I'll give you a chance to erase that
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:07:48 Well, sorta? They're allowed if you don't blow up every single server with them, and if they have some use aside from lagging the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:08:02 And if you mean the rank "lag machine" then they're fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:08:56 Not allowed, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:09:25 Only if it's for historical accuracy, if you put random Swastikas on planes, you're going to get banned for it
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:09:48 You need to build a WW2 german plane that had a swastika on it at one point or another, and claim historical accuracy, and it needs to be VERY detailed
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:10:51 ... <@456226577798135808> , if you do that, we will ban you
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:10:57 That is not historical accuracy in the slightest
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:11:09 It's not
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:11:39 You are <@!251493349981159436>
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:12:02 And <@456226577798135808> , again, you will be banned for such an act, it needs to be a historically accurate WW2 plane that had the symbol on it at some point
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:12:23 Reaver?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:14:33 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:14:49 <@456226577798135808> , do I need to warn you gain for those kinds of jokes?
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:16:31 If you replicate that in a way that it's recognizable, you'll get the "historical accuracy" pass, so long as it's only on the tail
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:17:12 Just remember, it needs to be easily recognizable as it's WW2 real life counterpart
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:18:16 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:18:47 We have chat logs you know!
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:19:04 Now quit acting stupid and highly obnoxious before you get kicked
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:20:09 Just a kick for now
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:20:13 If he tries again though
creations-chat 2018-12-17 23:59:42 Ah, it's too heavy?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 00:21:01 Add more helium all-round to make it lighter
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 01:31:11 Left seems more agile, right seems more efficient
the-dump 2018-12-18 02:16:27 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:16:34 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:16:51 **AHEM**
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:17:14 For fuck's sake guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:17:38 Cut it out now before I grab a ban hammer and whack-a-mole you guys into new you shaped holes in the floor
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:17:43 Got it?
general 2018-12-18 02:18:19 ... For fuck's sake guys
general 2018-12-18 02:18:24 <@!264873879640604673> , cut it out, now
general 2018-12-18 02:18:28 It ain't funny anymore
general 2018-12-18 02:19:14 The dump's a bit more flexible, but at the same time, no, just cut it out now
general 2018-12-18 02:20:26 General's still alive and kicking, but if you guys don't shape up and cut it out, it's gonna be gone, got it?
general 2018-12-18 02:20:50 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:21:04 Probably a good thing not to add, also, uhhh
bug-reports 2018-12-18 02:21:27 Issue: Engine noises keep on happening, even with sounds off, I'm gonna blame the fact that I have so many that it's overloading the system, so it can't mute them all
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:22:46 You know it's based on activity, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:25:53 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:25:59 Are you serious, just are, you know what, enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:26:44 What the fuck?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:27:03 OH FUCK
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:27:18 I told the others to ignore it
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:27:21 At least one of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:27:46 Honestly that's pretty cool potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:28:01 You're on one known infraction by MEE6, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:28:27 <@!362351190618538005> , only once, but that's only because I'm shuffling something away, which could be considered it's own thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:28:48 We aren't bots or stupid ya know, we check infractions before banning for too many
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:29:28 You made a few NSFW style jokes, since everyone at the time jumped on the bandwagon however, I'm going to let it pass
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:29:46 But if you guys try it again, I'm gonna come in swinging with a ban hammer, hope you're all wearing helmets, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:31:33 ... Guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:31:37 Are you fucking serious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:31:46 Are y- <@!216371990959882241> , are you fucking serious?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:31:57 Are **ALL** of you fucking serious!?

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:32:48 By the way <@!216371990959882241> , WE CAN SEE CHATLOGS
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:32:58 So don't fucking type something out and erase it thinking you're being smart
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:33:19 Still appears in chatlogs
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:42:48 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:42:55 <@!362351190618538005> , cut it out, now, just, cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:45:58 Because you keep on making yourself such a big and obvious target that it's impossible NOT to single you out
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:46:36 Imperial, wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:46:42 The first one repeated
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:47:08 Meh, one more chance then blast him
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:47:35 Not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:47:45 Show the part count?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:48:47 How do I hate you exactly Deception?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:48:58 Kratos, check for it in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:49:18 ... Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me of that, I ought to burn your eyebrows for saying "f james" in-game
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:49:33 (Not, really gonna do that by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 02:49:49 Too bad reblex, you can't love a game and not the people
creations-chat 2018-12-18 02:50:10 I would've called it the Albatross to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:04:21 Tell them "Rickej has been notified of your actions, if you do not alter your creation immediately, you will be banned"
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:05:30 ... <@!264873879640604673> , no offense but are you actually stupid? Nobody in their right minds believes that crud
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:15:18 ... The actual fuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:16:07 Is that the public server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 03:18:08 <@!354786846049566720> , you do rules in the Discord apply in-game, right?

creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:22:52 Simply put the Stiletto's ridonkulously fast, even faster than my MK4 fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:23:11 (This thing for reference, clocks about 510, 520ish horizontally)
creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:27:57 You beached it, how do you beach a freaking tank?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:28:08 Oy, Tornado, none of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:02:53 Excuse me what the fuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:03:14 Can it and shove it in the dump, and no NSFW, now
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:22:19 Ahem <@!484363661121421332>
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:17 <@!484363661121421332> , can you cut it out with the freaking Uno? I'm getting really sick of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:18 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:19 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:26 I need to sleep to fix my life tomorrow
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:29 So can you all, please
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:28:37 __**SHUT, THE ACTUAL, FUCK, UP!?**__
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:29:10 Thank you guys, and finally g'night
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:05:06 Ahem ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:05:37 Can you cut it out, seriously? Half my screen's filled with your 1-5 word statements
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:05:53 Consolidate it somehow, preferably by typing longer statements
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:07:27 ... Not, what I meant
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:08:08 Yes it does make you look more professional, but I mean quit doing this, for 2 reasons infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:08:41 First of all, insulting mods/admins/etc, even in a joking way, is a very, very good way to get booted out the door, and second, really short statements are really obnoxious
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:09:07 That last statement, the one starting with "Then what do you mean" is a good one, considering it's consolidated well and is easy to read
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:14:17 Enough with Uno, it's irritating, and yes I have been getting less and less tolerant of rule breakers after everyone keeps on repeatedly telling me I'm being too nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:16:19 Yes, I swear alot, get over it <@!301384851444203522> , it's just a grown habit of mine after life keeps on repeatedly trying to screw me over
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:17:26 Then I'm sorry <@!301384851444203522> , would you like me to do it again <@!301384851444203522> , or would you care to finally just drop it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:18:07 If you're wondering, yes, my life's gone to absolute shit today, I'm going to be very, very pissy and irritable, get used to it, at least for today
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:18:27 I'm not going to say
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:20:49 You can swear at people that provoke it, so long as the provocation is legitimate, example: Someone posts a 9/11 joke or a very racist PFP, you can go "Can you fucking not!?"
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:21:18 And, minor undirected swears are allowed, it's next to impossible to break the habit of swearing once it's set in, trust me, I've tried
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:22:34 <@328913062650314754> , Try that again ya fucker and I'm gonna break your face with the butt end of a shotgun
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:23:55 It's non-malicious chaos, so it's not too bad I suppose
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:24:17 Wasn't me
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:25:12 There, it's been poofed into hiding
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:30:22 We have the dump for a reason you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:30:35 You're sadly very late, so RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:32:45 Only if you can find an image that shows the real life creation with said swastika prominently displayed in an area, and the in-game creation mimics the real life one distinctly enough that it's recognizable immediately
general 2018-12-18 17:33:02 We have <#495286269459300364> for a reason you bunch ...
general 2018-12-18 17:33:24 Now drag the memes there before I take them down again
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:33:42 ... <@!319216576286949379> , you do realize I'm not in a good mood, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:34:06 You can claim "Historical accuracy" only if you actually build for historical accuracy <@!301384851444203522>
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:34:26 That's like saying "We should ban swastikas from the history books!" basically
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:35:17 Are you, seriously trying to stand your ground on a point that most other people seem to agree with?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:35:35 Historical accuracy, and only historical accuracy ... nothing else
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:35:58 Plus it's surprisingly hard to paint symbols on crafts without altering their balance or making it look horrendous
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:36:47 Not even slightly
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:37:34 And if they call it, we'll tell them "So long as they build and claim historical accuracy, but the moment they step out of those bounds, we will get rid of them, unless you would like to erase the entirety of WW2 from the textbooks"
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:39:07 Are you serious <@!301384851444203522> ? Fine, draft a letter to every government in the world to ban WW2 from history textbooks
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:40:02 Example of historical accuracy (And that's assuming you can build it)
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:40:03 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Messerschmitt_Me_262A_at_the_National_Museum_of_the_USAF.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:40:25 You're allowed it on the tail, because that's literally the first image that appears when you search up Me-262
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:41:39 Then why don't they ban all those D-day or WW2 games?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:42:19 And that is where your argument falls flat on it's freaking face sonnuy ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:43:02 Sonnuy, do you really want to try me today?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:43:16 If swastikas were such a problem, why don't they shut down all building games then?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:44:17 And what source can you provide that actively shows this in a way that we don't already do, or attempt to do within our powers?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:45:34 Just give me one source showing that then
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:46:03 And before you state anything, there are multiple WW2 simulators on Roblox with swastikas on the Axis side, so you're gonna have to come up with a better argument than that
the-dump 2018-12-18 17:46:32 Taking that one down in the event that it's considered NSFW ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:46:43 Yet they still existed at one point or another
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:47:30 That's your essay/example?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:48:32 ... Legendary, it's technically on-topic since sonnuy's trying to be a little anarchist and argue that Plane Crazy can't have historically accurate crafts
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:48:50 Yes it does LTzen
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:49:35 Oh for fuck's sake, sonnuy, let me ask you this, will you just argue with every statement that you can argue against? Is that all you're here for? Because you've taken a nearly zealous stance against two of my statements now
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:52:23 Show me the VTOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:52:40 Just do whatever you need to
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:53:33 Also, to be honest if that's the case <@!118113664636157953> , then why would, again, many WW2 games on Roblox have the swastika prominently displayed on the Axis clothing and gear, yet Roblox has not batted an eye to it
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:54:21 Not exacatly a VTOL you know <@!319216576286949379>
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 17:55:32 We're assuming VTOLs have primarily forwards momentum, but can land straight vertically
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:00:41 Don't suggest anything stupid <@!319216576286949379> , we made it so unranked people can't suggest for a reason, please check the pins before suggesting anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:08:16 Be very good, respectable, responsible and generally act like you aren't just a big joke, and when the next mod admissions come in, you'll be considered
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:10:15 <@456226577798135808> , it's a glitch, save and load your creation again
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:10:23 If you don't have wing panels, place some down
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:10:31 That's your center of lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:12:57 Mod apps (As Xpert mentioned) come on during certain milestones, or if the admin/moderator staff is understaffed (Example: 3 of us just decide to leave for whatever reason, whether it's life or otherwise), and the bar tends to be set pretty high
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:14:29 While looking secure is most of the way towards being secure (Aka: Inactive, but visible and "online" mods scare off most trolls and such), activity is one of the major factors, as well as how you treat situations, how professional you seem (Or have developed into), how level-headed you are, how knowing you are of the rules, and how you generally act
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:16:08 And you can't just fake it as soon as the applications come out, we will remember your past history
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:17:20 The best way to help "fellow unranked players" is to become ranked, gain them recognition of their creations, and assist them to getting ranks
general 2018-12-18 18:17:33 Not that kind of period
general 2018-12-18 18:17:49 Just don't ask, I'm on zero tolerance mode today
general 2018-12-18 18:18:47 If you want "not very nice", I can show you what that looks like, someone egged me on to do so before and now they're in the banned bin
general 2018-12-18 18:19:21 Just, today's not a good day, not to mention there's children here
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:21:12 Alright, also you're making a relatively good start already, showing potential growth, just don't screw it up and act like a moron and you should be examined for mod apps in the future
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:22:32 Again, showing potential growth, just keep on refining yourself and who knows, maybe you'll be a mod one day
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:23:29 Not sure, I think so?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:24:41 Very creative name, nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:29:42 Oh nice, that's actually pretty cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:30:05 Hmmmm, actually, Grab, could you make the loops huge and a creation that can tug along multiple?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:30:18 Like, 5-7, different colors?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:30:36 Sorta
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:30:58 One set huge size, 5-7 different colors, if you can't guess what I'm thinking, I'm thinking of a potential race
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:32:59 Like, a suspended racetrack in the air or a racetrack for flying vehicles?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:33:20 If it's the former, what fun is that, and how would people access it? If it's the latter, that's what I'm suggesting for a race
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:35:02 Well I turned it into a suggestion, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:37:20 Doesn't have to clog up the skies if done well
creations-chat 2018-12-18 18:41:15 Make it a gif or something if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 20:37:45 Pretty flipping nice to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 20:39:08 The inside is loose, the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:00:41 What the actual hell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:01:09 ... Either get to the point if it's about your experience or shut it if you're going to post it
creations-chat 2018-12-18 21:01:31 Read the ranks ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:01:36 ......
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:02:15 Now fuck off
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:03:37 And that <@367828860810821632> , is why you don't act like an idiot, because you'll get burned, both in Discord and in real life in the long term
creations-chat 2018-12-18 21:05:09 You got master builder
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:06:11 That's what I'm saying, we need a tall corner wedge
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:07:38 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:11:49 Not without clear proof
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:12:17 Let's just say the vid was a shooting, not saying anything more (No don't auto-assume it's human either)
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:14:28 It really just dissolves down to "Don't be (a[n]) inappropriate/idiotic/troll", yet we have to remind people of this constantly because whop de freaking do, we've got the Roblox community to deal with, and this is the internet
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:17:34 Just ask to drop them on someone, or if it's on a random server, I'm sure people won't (or really can't) mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:17:55 Just don't drop one of Imperial's boeings on them
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:25:21 The hell are you trying to do <@!264873879640604673>
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:25:35 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:25:51 The lord says no, and the lord will smite you if you do not stop
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:26:22 So say the church and emperor
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:27:04 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:27:54 Oh look
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:27:56 Leave it to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:27:58 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:29:34 Try to start a crusade again and see what thy god emperor will do to thou foul trollish face (Trying to be funny here)
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:29:55 But seriously though, cut it out <@!264873879640604673>
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:30:32 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:30:38 "Bully", uhhh, how about no?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:31:09 RIP him
bug-reports 2018-12-19 02:34:33 Dancing into the ether huh?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:44:37 Nice cockpit design, taking notes off of mine?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:47:44 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:47:48 Great minds think alike huh?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 02:50:04 I think the caption should be "Hey guys check out my cool plaaAAAAA-"
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 03:00:23 Go for it Imperial, just make sure to give credit
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 03:01:22 Be aware that there are quite a few internal components
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 03:02:33 Hold on, I'll give ya one of the internals a bit later
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 03:02:58 Aaaand the upload isn't working, RIP
the-dump 2018-12-19 03:41:11 Wat?
the-dump 2018-12-19 03:41:29 Welp
the-dump 2018-12-19 03:41:38 Now I'm a gentleman dragon aren't I?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 04:17:28 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:23:25 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:23:51 So, Kevin, <@456226577798135808> , one of the rules is to never ping Rick and Mad, primarily because otherwise they'd get overflowed with stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:24:23 You do realize we can confirm this with Rick (when he's back on), right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:24:38 .... Oh wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:24:40 Wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:24:56 __**FML NEVERMIND**__
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:25:26 Made a note to ignore it, god damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:25:37 Sorry about that Kevin, just, try not to go overboard with it, alright?
general 2018-12-19 20:44:53 Roblox seems to give half a damn about the reports and crap I send to/about people/places, so I sent one about that clone
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:05 Wait how is it player chasing?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:39 Is it yours?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 20:45:55 Welp
general 2018-12-19 20:48:14 Not even that Phoenix, places I've reported have vanished off of Roblox, people I've reported suddenly went missing on the Roblox page (They never come online), and to be honest, I'd say it's creepy, except it's at my command
general 2018-12-19 20:49:09 Wait, seriously?
general 2018-12-19 20:49:15 Wooooow, welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:54:37 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:54:39 Teal
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:54:47 You do realize we know about your copying, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:55:03 Imperial's stuff, alot of it infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:55:21 I think so, didn't you mention it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:55:29 I, can't remember, my memory's fucked today
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:56:05 Imperial, not on my word
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:56:10 Again, my memory's fucked, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:56:33 I will say, once a copier, always a copier though
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:58:23 It's not copying if you get it off a tutorial (Although, no offense but you're crap if you rely entirely on tutorials for your craft)
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:59:33 I remember someone mentioned it Imperial, I don't remember who, and again, my memory's fucked up, so don't take my word for it
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 20:59:55 Empire maybe? I know it was one of the older people in the Discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:00:14 It was a boeing thing, that much I remember
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:00:33 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:02:40 Then copy off of their design?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:02:47 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:03:02 As long as they allow it dead, and assuming they're your friend, they'd probably allow it
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:03:14 That's what he already got punished for
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:03:33 OH HOLD ON A MOMENT
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:03:39 <@!460178257812258836> , AHEM

help 2018-12-19 21:08:05 Sorta, think of how an arrow works to stabilize it's self
help 2018-12-19 21:08:12 There's drag on the tail to keep it straight
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:08:41 Well, they're nice games, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:10:18 Mad lurks alot, but he's pretty cool when he comes on
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:10:19 ...

plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:12:13 RIP Grab
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:13:06 ... Very, very good point turbo
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:13:13 Welp
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:06 Ouch, the heck?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:10 What happened to the first one?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:15:56 You might wanna check your E-mail account, someone probably hacked into it
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:16:33 The password was changed twice, meaning likely someone wanted to try to capture it and pretend to be you
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:16:47 So by the third one, they think you're the one doing it, and you get the blame
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:17:06 <@!340543153922768906> , that looks like a sun
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:17:13 <@!460178257812258836> , you have, 1 chance at this
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:17:31 Within 1 hour, provide a GIF of your entire save data, or you will be banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:17:40 And we mean scroll through every single one of your creations
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:17:54 What are you replicating?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:18:15 Deleting it means we got our point across anyways, because he'd have to get rid of his creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:18:31 Heeyyyy! You're trying to get record for the longest non-crazy ban aren't you?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:18:41 But anyways, <@!460178257812258836> , do you understand?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:19:27 Close enough to be a Phantom definitely
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:19:34 You need upvotes though
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:20:10 Seems like Galeem's unhappy with you Grablador
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:20:53 You can earn every rank in one creation if it can do all of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:21:00 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:25:50 Not bad, part count or just for show?
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:26:25 Alright
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:31:55 I mean, think of how much effort this game would require
the-dump 2018-12-19 21:34:01 Try that again jacky and see what happens
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:34:41 It's an inappropriate image and not only that, you spammed it in <#495286269459300364> and tried to spam it in <#497142796961054721>
general 2018-12-19 21:35:18 The dump is not NSFW
general 2018-12-19 21:35:36 .....
general 2018-12-19 21:35:43 Quit trying to spam if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 21:36:32 ... All in one bunch if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:17 Propeller master requires zero engines
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:22 Not even for maneuvering
creations-chat 2018-12-19 21:41:54 Magic, and lots of engineering skill
bug-reports 2018-12-19 21:53:18 How viable is a rewrite exactly?
general 2018-12-19 21:55:17 Welp, that's adorable
general 2018-12-19 21:57:21 I'm more interested in the walking dragon, because, you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:03:31 It's not harassment, alright?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:05:54 Alright alright fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:06:04 I was just trying to joke around a bit
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:10:02 He was just kicked, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:10:34 It's trigger happy because you make things that trigger literally anyone <@!264873879640604673> , now cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:10:38 Nobody likes being raided ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:25:37 Modeler is for unique creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:25:45 Example:
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:26:17 Let's see it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:27:18 Tiny tends to not get modeler, because it can easily be copied
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:29:09 As long as it looks very, very unique, it can get modeler
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:29:46 You need to be able to recognize it and go "OH! That's (Person)'s!" right off the bat if you see it basically
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:30:54 Ballast can be tweaked to be heavier than normal
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:31:07 I, can't see the outline <@!251493349981159436> , try showing it during the day time?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:36:09 Hmmm, alright, I'll give it to ya Creep
creations-chat 2018-12-19 22:37:32 You wanna try it again?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:05:46 Er, wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:05:58 <@398245378861826048> , due to recent Discord ToS updates, we have to ask you to leave if you're under 13
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:06:31 There's been a Discord Terms of Service update that means if you're under 13, you can't be on Discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:06:43 And we can get in trouble if we allow confirmed under 13 year old people on Discord, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:07:03 Er, ouch, blame Roblox, not us
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:10:33 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:11:05 Ahem <@398245378861826048> , 1: Harassing people is not tolerated, even if they lag stuff, and 2: Are you seriously resetting to respawn?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:11:35 The underage thing we're going to try to ignore until it becomes a problem ,as this is Roblox we're talking about
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:12:02 Next person to throw some beans around I'm gonna throw one without the E, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:12:30 Well, more than likely they'll be here, but otherwise you might be out of luck, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:12:53 ... <@398245378861826048> , tell me, were you resetting?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:12:57 ................................................
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:13:32 Ehhhhh, Linh, you're flying a bit close to the sun there with rule 2, but, I'll leave it be
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:13:38 If someone complains about it though, mind changing it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:14:11 The important part's the controversial topics one
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:14:20 I'll leave it for now, but if someone complains about it, please change it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 01:01:45 ... <@!216371990959882241> , that'd take up an extra save slot's worth of data, which would likely go over the save data limit
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 01:02:11 In other words you're asking to decrease available building for a layer of security, one that not even I'm a fan of after having deleted one of my prized creations
creations-chat 2018-12-20 01:43:52 Pretty cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:26:06 Unless they're in the server, we can't do anything about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:26:24 Wait they are?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:26:40 ... Who exactly? I can't get the initial symbol
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:26:50 Infact, no part of their name
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:27:12 ... <@!335664626324865036> , I mean in the Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:27:33 What do you think I mean by "Server"? of COURSE he's in the Roblox server
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:27:54 But anyways, unless we get in-game moderation, that ain't happening, and because of Madattak's stance against that, RIP all of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:28:04 And don't go and ping/DM him annoying stuff, that's just a way to get him even more against it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:43:16 Uhhhh, <@456226577798135808> , could you change your GIF a bit? It's, a bit disturbing
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:44:06 Well, sadly no
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:45:05 Just, change it if you'd please
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:46:11 I made an announcement of it in <#490306593242611742> after alot of people had, let's just say NSFW, PFPs, GIFs, whatever, for their profile icon
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:46:23 Thanks, give Rick credit for doing magic on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:48:04 I'm somewhat willing to bet they're just gonna sit it out until they can change it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:49:30 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:49:47 If someone shouts "COMMUNIST WORM" or something though, please change it to another thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:50:01 Well, actually
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:50:09 You can stand your ground on that one and just call one of us over
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:55:49 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 03:55:58 <@456226577798135808> don't try that again
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:05:39 Don't let this be your first ...
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:05:49 Rule 2
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:06:30 Simply put, no NSFW
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:06:57 ...... Oh, it, nevermind
the-dump 2018-12-20 04:07:17 Yeeeeeeeup
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 04:21:59 Hold on, we have an error
general 2018-12-20 04:22:11 Try now
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 04:22:28 There we go
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 04:29:58 Blue, just save your current work and delete it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 04:30:14 Enough with the emojis if you'd please ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 05:05:30 <@!251995895405477888> , ENOUGH WITH THE FREAKING BEANS, god damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 05:28:18 HOLY, right, who built that, can you tell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 05:29:13 God damn that craft looks freaking nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 05:29:30 Experiment with the design
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:34:13 I'm gonna stop it before it goes too far
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:34:29 Nah, no more
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 20:34:56 I think you got the wrong pointman
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:35:11 ... <@!340543153922768906> , ENOUGH
the-dump 2018-12-20 20:35:22 Seriously, this is spanning like 90 pages now (not actually, but you get the point)
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 20:35:28 Welp, huh
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 21:22:28 Look like the Aurora got nuked
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 21:33:28 RIP that idiot
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 21:33:56 There's a reason you don't come on an intelligent server and try a "free robux" scam
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 21:34:05 Rick, just add a tip jar
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 21:34:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:05:31 <@!264873879640604673> , He's working on more wedges consistently
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:05:43 So, no duh he's not announcing it, every update thus far has introduced a new kind of wedge
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:13:46 Uhhhh ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:13:53 You need 10 upvotes for master replicator
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:14:26 .... Show us Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:14:44 Also, <@!264873879640604673> , you can now submit suggestions, always check the pins and always check if your suggestion has been made
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:15:00 ............
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:15:10 <@461111372239994881> , can you not?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:15:20 <@!227555337945743360> Sorry, but you need to go
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:16:18 There's 2 criteria upon which you can send DMs, the first is that you're friends with them, and the second is when you share the same Discord server
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:16:57 Remember, I used ZERO helium and ballasts, and I use 1X1 whenever possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:17:29 Alvin, he cropped it FROM an NSFW source
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:17:34 Which is close enough that we consider it NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:17:51 .... Because multiple other people didn't just blurt out "It came from an NSFW source"
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:18:05 We can't tell which source it came from, so we ignore the ones we can't verify until we have verification
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:18:32 Because if we try something like that, next thing you know we need to make a "No anime" rule, which will piss ALOT of people off (You will be shocked at how many)
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:19:18 Then DM me the original whole PFP
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:19:34 Hey, I'm old enough, so don't worry
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:20:46 Alvin, that's on an ad zone, we can't do anything about it because it's not an actual link
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:21:23 How to tell it's likely an alt:
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:24:24 ... <@!227555337945743360> So long as you are within the Discord server, you can access everyone within the server's DMs, so we have to treat DMs as if they were in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:24:36 In other words, get out, again
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:26:24 Simply put he shared a potential NSFW PFP with Alvin, who still hasn't bothered to clear it up, and claimed "Because it's in DMs, you have no jurisdiction over me"
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:26:56 Xpert, the thing is, as long as they're within the Discord server, they can DM anyone they want in that server
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:27:22 It's the same guy ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:27:35 Wait, no it's not, it's different, the heck?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:28:20 Also, Xpert, if someone started sharing NSFW with everyone, would that still be out of our jurisdiction?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:28:36 I sense a bot raid ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:28:47 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:31:35 You, sorta, don't want to know
creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:32:12 Wait that's by the bot
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:32:28 **DON'T ASK**
creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:32:49 Ah, there we go
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:33:44 Now I'm gonna go afk for stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:33:55 I'd better not come back to a server on fire or something
creations-chat 2018-12-20 22:35:07 You got it, but I think you miiiiight miss out on this application, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:53:31 What, did I just stumble into?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:53:43 Rick's fine with it, so, I'm gonna pretend nothing's happening
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:54:03 At the very least nobody's faces are meeting the receiving end of hammers
help 2018-12-20 22:58:31 It's custom color saving
help 2018-12-20 22:58:42 Basically it lets you save specific colors, rather than use Roblox's custom color palette
help 2018-12-20 22:58:58 Disabling it means your colors will default to Roblox's standards, but it will also use alot less save data
help 2018-12-20 23:00:49 Doom, not quite
help 2018-12-20 23:01:10 There's a set color palette that Roblox uses, it'll automatically try to assign your color to whatever's the closest value when you save
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:02:20 Speaking of ban hammers, why do I hear this in my head whenever someone's about to be banned?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3z_RkeImLI
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:02:45 I mean, it fits, doesn't it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:03:36 It's the music that appears when you pick up a hammer in Super Smash Brothers, which funnily enough is the same hammer from the original Donkey Kong arcade games
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:35:55 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:36:07 <@456226577798135808> , I'm going to delete the link if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:40:30 I'm gonna bug them
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:42:20 Turns out it was just an honest mistake
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:44:26 Heyo
creations-chat 2018-12-21 01:29:33 ... <@!368630214747619340> <@!168154760866693120> , both of you, cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:30:37 Wouldn't surprise me considering, last I heard EA's entering a legal battle with Belgium
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:31:16 You know what, think I should just merge <#497142796961054721> and <#384021699466756107> Rick?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:31:17 I think so
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:31:44 Ehhh, alright, when he's on next time
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:32:51 Oh ouch, RIP Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:33:21 Shhhshushushhh!
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:33:54 Also, let's face it, sometimes those kinds of people are awesome, one of the ones I know is making, basically a multiplayer FTL
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:34:36 Ehh, it fits a certain niche
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:34:56 I personally don't because I heard it was as grindy as all hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:35:05 Waiting for Rebel Galaxy: Outlaw though
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:35:58 I'm pretty sure I'd get it, but still be bored by it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:37:27 Hey, we ain't doing drag races Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:37:39 Oh ouch, why were they wiped?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:42:26 ... Aheemmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:43:11 ....... Guys, seriously, come on
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:43:21 I am **NOT** getting involved in this
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:43:31 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:44:03 The sad thing is it still would've gone through, but it would've been deleted
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:44:41 There, now he can't do anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:45:12 I will stay neutral and out of it, but if anyone bugs me about it I'm going to drop the Tsar Bomba on them
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:45:50 The MOAB is a concentrated strike, Tsar Bomba's one that can erase Japan off the face of the earth
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:46:45 So are we just talking about what's the biggest weapon now?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:52:43 Okay, enough guys, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:52:46 RIP Kave
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:53:59 I thiiink that might be enough Rick, fun's fun and all but it does get a bit chaotic
general 2018-12-21 01:55:25 Someone give me an idea of what the actual hell is going on with the whole "Pew vs T"?
the-dump 2018-12-21 01:55:57 Talk about a smackdown
general 2018-12-21 01:56:45 ... Seriously?
general 2018-12-21 01:57:41 ...
general 2018-12-21 01:58:25 What happened exactly <@!264873879640604673>
general 2018-12-21 01:58:46 Welp
general 2018-12-21 01:59:22 Alright alright, enough guys, memes in <#495286269459300364>, things not about Plane Crazy in <#497142796961054721> , things about Plane Crazy in <#384021699466756107>
general 2018-12-21 01:59:42 I'm booting General back up, got it?
general 2018-12-21 01:59:53 Try to minimize it
general 2018-12-21 02:00:09 Also, I'm gonna try to merge <#384021699466756107> and <#497142796961054721> , but I'm not merging <#495286269459300364>
general 2018-12-21 02:00:15 With Xpert's permission of course
general 2018-12-21 02:00:45 Why do you think I'm going to ask Xpert about it?
general 2018-12-21 02:00:55 <@288499143956103169> , can you cut it out already?
general 2018-12-21 02:01:00 Use words, not emotes
general 2018-12-21 02:03:13 Excuse me for a moment while I fix <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:03:49 Now General should be working
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:06:04 Emojis are fine, but just don't barf out an excess of them
the-dump 2018-12-21 02:06:24 Er, volume warning on that one, my ears
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:06:37 ........
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:06:44 Uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:07:03 We, literally just went over, no memes in general
the-dump 2018-12-21 02:07:31 It's fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:08:42 I'm staying out of this one, I would've just done a verbal warn
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:09:51 Honestly, I'd say some are fine, but an excess from the same person just means they want to break rules, aaaand <#384021699466756107> 's been murdered
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:10:33 RIP, is it just me or after every mod action, the channel either explodes into a near-riot or goes silent, depending on whether it's bad or good people on?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:10:45 <@377596437283995660> AHEM
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:11:06 Okay maybe you're going a bit too hardline on this stuff Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:11:16 Also, g'night Rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:13:50 Meh, you could argue that people have broken spines because of me enforcing non-blurry rules, right Imperial?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:14:24 Huh, you gonna design that thing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:14:47 Good luck
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:20:12 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:20:25 The hell was he muted for in the first place?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:20:33 Because, to this day he's still muted
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:20:53 ......
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:21:10 Temporarily muted until we can figure out what you were intially muted for, or if it was just a fluke
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:21:51 Can't find anything, soooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:22:05 There, now your initial account's unmuted
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:22:19 Mind if we manually kick the two alts?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:22:31 So, "go for it"?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:22:39 Got it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:23:26 Up to you Farol
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:23:45 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:23:55 I know what you're mentioning
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:24:26 It might be important to you, but it's not important to a bunch of kids
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:24:44 .....
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:24:46 Web
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:24:48 There's kids here
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:03 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:09 We don't want to expose them to it then
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:27 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:36 <@!298129144422858752> , suggest that again and see what happens
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:41 .....
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:25:59 Webcat, you'll be surprised at how horribly curious some of these kids are, they'll reverse-trace it and find out
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:26:09 And then shit, meet industrial grade fan
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:26:30 Just drop it and don't try mentioning it again, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:26:50 ......... <@267353491528220695> , I said drop it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:26:55 Also, <@!168154760866693120> , pretty cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:31:13 <#497142796961054721> with this if you don't mind
general 2018-12-21 02:36:07 .............. Wait wait wait wait wait hold up <@!298129144422858752>
general 2018-12-21 02:36:32 What, do you mean by that <@!298129144422858752>
general 2018-12-21 02:36:35 Explain
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:42:25 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:43:01 <@!264873879640604673> , we already mentioned why plot size, storage and decals won't work, but if you want a refresher
Plot size is hard coded
Storage is Roblox's limit, not ours
Decals are too unwieldly
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 02:44:19 The Wyvern fighter doesn't wobble for me, must be lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:33:54 Er, what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:35:38 "misses"? No offense but are you SURE you know how to read?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:36:22 Oh, you mean missiles
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 03:36:33 They automatically lock-on when in a close enough proximity
general 2018-12-21 04:13:44 Now it's got two missile pods
general 2018-12-21 04:13:56 WAIT WRONG ONE
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:14:06 Modified the Dragon slightly
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:14:30 Main weapons are still the same, just that it's got an added pod that doubles as an engine pod, similar to the ones on the Goliath, except weaponized as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:15:30 Clocks at 560, has reverse thrust, is durable as absolute sin, great gun focus and maneuvers even better than the Wyvern, which can maneuver within the length of the spawn zone (The big block that you land ontop)
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:16:15 For reference, this is the Wyvern, and it's still highly combat viable in this state
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:16:39 Yes, I know, Imperial is more durable, but come on, his is a friggin boeing
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:18:16 New updated Dragon, featuring missile pods now alongside it's already excessive firepower
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:19:19 Actually, I realized one thing, I was talking in terms of "it's still combat viable", you're talking in terms of "it still flies"
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:19:41 How combat viable IS that thing to be honest?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:10 Wa- make this thing transform
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:15 This, monstrosity of a fighter, transform?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:23 Are you kidding me Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:21:43 I'm literally hitting the build limits here with this thing! How am I supposed to make it transform into anything while still making it useful?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:24:25 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/570f02e240261da404b66297/t/574e27d63c44d81bb19c0dea/1464739886064/ I win
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:26:36 ... Uhhhhh, hiiii?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:27:09 Who are you exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:27:19 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:27:51 I think you're moreso just psychotic
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:28:12 Not to mention a make a wish kid wouldn't get to annoy other people
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:28:31 .......
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:29:06 ...........
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:38:15 Enter PVP mode and leftclick
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:38:28 ... Guys, quit trying to bring Flat Earth stuff on here
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:40:45 Fighter MK 5 Dragon
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:40:50 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:40:55 
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 04:41:06 Re-shuffling it to group up the images
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:42:32 MTOW?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:12 Well let me put it this way, the Wyrm, the first variant of the Dragon ever made, before jet engines were nerfed, could carry this much https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363606144483338/Capture_63.PNG
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:36 Those are all max weight ballasts by the way
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:44:50 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:45:13 Now some midway between jets and rockets were the old jets' strength, but now we have super rockets
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:45:45 The King Dragon's about 1.4K
creations-chat 2018-12-21 04:47:23 Well now I need to test out max weight by strapping a block on the bottom
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:06:22 Wait, what happened <@!260797229068058634> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:06:48 ... I want his side of the story
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:08:47 Ah? You could've just put yourself on Do Not Disturb or notify the mod crew to resign temporarily
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:09:35 Also, welcome to Mr.PRMdrago, population: Me
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:10:11 How do you think I feel whenever someone intentionally starts throwing a shitstorm or directing it towards me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:14:36 Unless it has the secret sauce, it's a regular burger
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:15:05 Wait, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:16:30 ... You lying little piece of crud, you do realize you said something that was very easy to check, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:16:46 Show us the website you got it off of if you really want to prove you aren't lying
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:18:44 Pretty cool, tell them "Hello from the Plane Crazy 'Cord community"
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:19:22 ....... <@461111372239994881> , you do realize you just fooled yourself, okay?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:24:41 Looks like a modernized ME-262
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:27:16 Hooooly SH- okay then
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:28:09 I mean, by technicalities it'd get master builder as the rank, due to the fact that we still need Xpert to update the rank requirement to be surface, rather than land vehicles, but, screw it, I'm gonna give you server exterminator anyways, if for nothing else than the fully detailed interior
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:29:09 Like, seriously, damn that thing's huge and impressive
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:30:58 I mean, it's not half bad
creations-chat 2018-12-21 19:36:05 I mean, the Ragnarok has a ton of wings
help 2018-12-21 19:37:28 They're probably going to be an opt-in thing to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:37:53 It's called a fanbase Rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:38:04 **OKAY ENOUGH**
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:38:25 Guys, enough, seriously, I think this is getting a bit too far
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:38:45 Sorry, had to, it was getting excessive
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:39:16 ._. That was Rick, not me, I think that means "Stop"
help 2018-12-21 19:39:36 It was uninteresting at the time
general 2018-12-21 19:41:18 In the dump, not off topic
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:41:33 ... **GUYS**
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:41:40 Please have some freaking common sense please
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:41:57 Anyways, drag stuff to <#495286269459300364> if it's memes, or <#497142796961054721> if it's not about Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:42:16 Yes, the "Rickje?" chain is a meme
help 2018-12-21 19:42:28 Planned in the future already
help 2018-12-21 19:43:02 My hope is that fuel acts like Terra Tech, where it's only used for specific engines (Or as an afterburner in this case) and regenerates mid-flight
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:43:46 Oh **GOD** what did you invite Rick?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:45:15 I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:45:25 Well, Rickje told them they could do it in <#495286269459300364> , so
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:46:16 Oh god even Rick's joining in!
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:49:11 No seizure inducing crud if you don't mind <@!280026855782744064>
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:51:27 No downloaded movies if you'd please
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:51:44 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 19:51:58 Ah, hey
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:55:35 Sonnuy, no offense but do you honestly just come on in order to bug everyone about every decision they make? Like, this isn't the first time where, very coincidentially, you just came on and started criticizing people of their actions, especially related to Discord
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:57:16 Now it's Mad
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:57:36 Watch as Madattak pops on, I'd imagine his head would explode from the chaos
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:17 Doesn't really work like that
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:26 It's smart enough to not count spam, sooo
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:40 I mean, you don't see the server updates exploding with level ups do you?
the-dump 2018-12-21 19:59:49 Are we just gonna roll through the entire list?
the-dump 2018-12-21 20:00:24 I'm gonna just stay out of the chaos, jesus freaking christ
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:00:43 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:02:28 Well, I guess?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:03:35 <@398831625544269835>  ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:04:43 Excuse me while I stop my ears from ringing
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:05:46 It wasn't earrape, it was ear *MURDER*, ear **GENOCIDE**, okay?
the-dump 2018-12-21 20:08:21 Make the call and I'm gonna end it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:59:36 Tell him that copying other people's creations is a bannable offense
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:59:43 And make SURE he gets the note
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:02:28 Do you realize how much effort that'd take and how much save space that'd occupy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:02:38 Also, are you in the server still Stridel?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:02:42 OY!
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:03:08 Ah, which is?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:05:19 I'm gonna try joining Stridel, hold on
creations-chat 2018-12-21 21:12:10 Okay, yes, the starter plane, what about it?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 21:12:44 It's still in <#384025409945337856> you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:40:15 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:40:46 Only mods can do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:48:53 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:48:59 <@!324566285155434497> do I even NEED to say why!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:49:21 ..............
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:49:28 Don't mention it again or else I'm going to warn you for it, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:49:43 I already snapped the neck (not literally) of someone that suggested an NSFW channel, don't make me do it again
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:10 That's the equivalent of getting this Discord murdered
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:13 Do you really want that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:21 .....
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:28 I'm serious you guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:37 That is literally the way to get this Discord murdered
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:40 .........
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:54:58 Then I'll show you the door to communism, aka: NOT HERE
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:55:37 ..........
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:56:56 ..........
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:56:57 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:57:01 Just, guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:57:13 Cut it out, like, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:57:15 Cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 21:59:23 Suggest something that'd help everyone in-game, that hasn't been suggested already, that fits the criteria of the pins
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:06:57 Blame the fact that people suggested idiotic, repeated and very, very bland and unorganized suggestions before
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:08:13 Check <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:09:20 It should, show the picture?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:10:00 Got it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:10:29 Done
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:17:34 Pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) or roll (clock/counter)?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:18:12 I need to know pitch, yaw or roll first before anything else
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:18:35 Do you need to improve it's pitch, it's yaw, or it's roll
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:19:17 You need a larger tail fin with more control surfaces, or a frontal fin as well if you want yaw
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:19:36 For pitch, make control surfaces near the tail and nose
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:20:04 There's no aerodynamics aside from "wings provide lift", so you can for sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:20:51 Not a problem, also try using rotated engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:35:14 I wonder if anyone has made a blacksmith before, like a proper modeled blacksmith with anvil and furnace and everything
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:35:21 It's not spinning, he's rotating the camera
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:36:42 You need a force at the bottom to keep it straight, and a force near the nose to keep it pointing forwards, you obviously can't do the force near the nose, so you need most of the weight to be at the bottom
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:37:22 Did somebody order an exterminator?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:37:28 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:39:59 I actually wonder if the King Dragon can carry your Blitzer
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:40:33 Like seriously, the Wyrm (My first fighter since the major updates) could carry pretty much twice, if not 3 times it's weight on a bomb strapped to it's underbelly
creations-chat 2018-12-22 01:40:37 And that was with jets
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 01:47:13 Ello there
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 01:47:26 "al dusty"?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 01:48:00 Uhhhh?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:05:08 <@!362535696470376450> , Can you not with the ISIS jokes, seriously
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:05:40 Engine lights? Oh god my fighter's gonna light up like a blue Christmas tree
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:06:24 You sure? I crammed a light block in the middle of my craft and the light bleeds out
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:06:35 It's, VERY noticable if I keep it on at max
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:07:05 You, aren't going to get a rank, for what's basically a poor go-kart using blocks and half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:07:23 It's, not actually a solution ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:07:52 <@!362535696470376450> , it's not a solution for spawnkilling, infact, one good gun shot through the head or on one of the legs and that thing's gone
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:07:59 So if anything it's even easier to be spawnkilled while in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:08:22 Return fire's a thing you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:08:30 Ah, so all engines have light ranges now, or?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:09:03 It's nearing completion from what I can see
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:09:25 You need upvotes for replicator, and self-upvotes and bot upvotes don't count
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:09:42 Terrible idea, big target, easy to hit with missiles
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:09:48 Also highly unarmored turret
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:10:05 **THIS** is a good idea to counterattack
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:10:20 Reverse thrust, heavy weaponry, extraordinarily bulky armor while still being able to maneuver on a dime
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:10:51 __***IF YOU PLAGIARIZE MY WORK SO HELP ME GOD I WILL ACTUALLY RIP YOUR FACE OFF AND BEAT THE REST OF YOU TO A FUCKING PULP WITH IT***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:04 Ahem, *cough* sorry about that
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:10 It's just I put alot of work into it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:13 And I mean alot alot
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:39 .... Tornadoooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:52 ... The hell do you think would've happened <@!362535696470376450> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:55 Yes That?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:11:58 Er, Cat
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:12:03 I keep on forgetting, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:12:07 And I'm not on a server currently
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:12:18 Why?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:12:35 And, you need me in a server for that, why?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:12:47 Aside from the fact that it's a one-off suicider bot of little to no quality?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:13:19 Until bigger guns are added, this is actually the craft I use for PVP, functions more or less the same believe it or not
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:13:43 And **NO**, no plagiarizing
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:13:52 Yes <@!354786846049566720> 
What do you think would happen <@!362535696470376450> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:14:28 ... It'd be more like "** * banned from the game * **"
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:14:53 .......
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:15:45 __***I WILL STRANGLE YOU***__ (Disclaimer, I won't actually do it) __***IF YOU PLAGIARIZE SOMEONE***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:16:14 Who did exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:16:46 ............................
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:17:23 I am serious (if not ever so slightly exaggerated) about copying/plagiarizing by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:18:05 Seriously, it's one of the fastest ways to murder a developer's soul and lead to shovelware creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:19:50 Rick, this is what I mean by light bleeding through
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:24:28 ......
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:24:30 Guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:24:37 Can you drag that crap to <#495286269459300364> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:27:34 Rocket pointed at his face
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:27:50 Quite literally the crudest and (no offense, but) most idiotic way to make one of those
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:27:59 .........
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:30:17 No offense but people have made better versions of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:31:06 Just go to the primary VIP server, in the pins, run by vipEmpire
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:31:57 You, aren't going to make an impressive one
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:32:13 I mean, if we can do technicalities, I have something large enough for you to land on
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:32:17 It's not a carrier though
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:32:57 ... <@!353323573815017472> Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:33:41 Just the one labeled "Official VIP server"
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:33:47 ... Dead, we know what you mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:34:02 And quite frankly, how about I make a dancing without anything on emoj-
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:37:15 Think I could get my fighter in there?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:38:17 Add guns to all of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:38:22 .....
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:39:01 FML ow, does this count for him for Daredevil?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:39:20 Damn it, he landed on my fighter for crap's sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:39:57 .............
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:43:21 ........
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:44:43 "!warn <@!354786846049566720> All of that!
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:44:58 (Notice how I didn't actually warn)
general 2018-12-22 02:46:01 Dead, can you cut it out?
general 2018-12-22 02:48:57 He closed DMs so people like you wouldn't just come up to him and start (without any other way to describe this) bitching to him about being warned or muted for something
general 2018-12-22 02:49:44 And quite frankly, 2 emojis used in an NSFW way is enough for a warn
general 2018-12-22 02:49:57 And I'm just saying, drop it, cut it out and leave him alone
general 2018-12-22 02:51:35 Empire, just leave it to me
general 2018-12-22 02:52:06 Right, Dead, I warned you for using the two emotes in that way, there's literally a rule, rule 2, which we have to, and will enforce with as much of our power as possible
general 2018-12-22 02:52:20 Don't complain to Imperial about it, complain to me about it
general 2018-12-22 02:53:19 Then just drop it, we get it, no need to drill the point until it becomes complaining
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:54:13 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:54:48 If by plagiarize section you mean a section for others to copy off of, then so long as you have the original creator's permission (Which, presumably if you post your precious creation in there for others to copy is a yes), then that'd be fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:55:08 "!ban <@420373278515920919> No banning everyone! (Notice how it's a joke?)
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:55:53 As soon as people pull their creations from that section though, you're no longer allowed to use it, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:56:40 RIP
help 2018-12-22 02:57:18 What do ya need help with?
help 2018-12-22 02:57:25 It rotates in the opposite direction?
help 2018-12-22 02:57:54 Yeah, that's a law of physics acting there
help 2018-12-22 02:57:59 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:58:42 .............
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:59:02 I'll pull out Tracer's pistols and blast both of your faces if you don't cut this out, if it's going where I think it's going
help 2018-12-22 02:59:17 Again, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
help 2018-12-22 03:01:24 Just think about what I stated for a moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:02:47 You asked for it to be deleted, you received
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:03:48 ... Enough with that, seriously
help 2018-12-22 03:04:26 The action of the propeller rotating is causing a reaction that affects your craft
help 2018-12-22 03:04:45 Actually, there was a test, the propeller blades in that orientation provide the most efficient movement
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:10:28 Did anyone clock his rankings?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:10:39 Ah
general 2018-12-22 03:14:39 <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind with that
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:18:19 All-terrain on crack?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:19:00 Might take a swing at modeler actually
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:19:22 Nevermind you already have it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 04:01:10 Life stuff, don't question it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 04:01:24 It's sorta just my way of screaming into the air, except, online
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:28:51 Well, <@!304253531886583808> , someone made a fully functional hand, but I don't think it could grab things
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:29:33 Wait a second, <@!304253531886583808> , if you can make it put on gloves or something, that might count for inventor of some sort
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:30:20 I mean, there's no other bot that can equip stuff (And, for good reason for some)
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:30:36 I know, I never said inventor was easy and right on the face of stuff
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:31:20 I'd say equip it
bug-reports 2018-12-22 20:32:32 Wait, it is?
bug-reports 2018-12-22 20:32:48 You, crazy mad magician you
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:33:53 ... What?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:34:10 VIP server
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:36:16 Yeah, remember: Inventor is the hardest role to get, for a reason, and a very damn good reason
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:49:37 More like space shuttle, but I'll double check
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:03 Wait, you already have a superior rank
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:22 Wait no nevermind, sorry
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:48 The thing is, you can't get master and expert builder, because master completely encompasses expert builder's requirements
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:50:54 That's what I thought was happening
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:51:07 But double checking, master scientist is for rocket speed, and elon musk is for parts and landing it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:56:15 It can't use lift or propulsion as it's primary form of lift, only helium
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:56:41 By technicalities this would count, as I actually made enough of the blocks helium that it mostly floats, although I'm not counting it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:57:05 Main reason I'm not counting it: The main wing
the-dump 2018-12-22 20:57:20 ... None of that please
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:57:42 So, no wings, rockets for control, and only about 1 or 2 engines for altitude control, rather than a ton for lift?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:58:06 You get the point
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:58:34 Alright, show me a picture of it?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 20:59:06 Er, flying if you'd please
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:01:57 Alright then, part count?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:03:58 Nobody's made a functioning calculator period
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:20 It'll need to do a variety of calculations with at least 2 digits, and be accurate
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:31 So 9+9=18, 20+20= 40, and so on
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:39 It can't just have a preset amount, otherwise that's just a demonstration
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:04:58 Er, well, just as an example
creations-chat 2018-12-22 21:11:14 Oh yeah, Ignacioel, contests
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:36:11 Then how about you try making one Xeilot?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:37:03 It's the closest thing I've seen so far, yes it's not a calculator, but unless someone comes up with something better, it's the best we're going to get
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:38:40 Alright then, if you fail, then what happens?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:39:45 Should I just erase it Ignacioel?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 22:40:01 Meh, alright, it's your call in the end, so
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:13:48 <@!478669911573528580> , no racial terms, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:14:14 Anyways, as far as we know, restitution basically means how much it wants to pull back to it's position
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:14:23 Think of it like stiffness on a spring, except one-way
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:14:38 Not really
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:14:46 Other way around
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:15:13 Basically it drags stuff towards it's self easier as far as I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 23:15:19 Also, <@461111372239994881> , can you cut it out? We get it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:57:24 I wonder, next time Rick's available, let's ask about how readily available wiring could work, I can see what needs to happen
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:58:40 All you need is a block that can take varrying amounts of inputs, including opposite inputs (such as if you want it off), and have that same block relay varrying amounts of outputs with opposite outputs, I think
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:59:10 I might be HORRIBLY wrong on this, so forgive me on that, but I think that's all that it'd need to work
creations-chat 2018-12-22 23:59:51 Hell, once we add sensors and wiring, we can basically make or automate nearly anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 01:54:46 It's just one of those days isn't it? I can already tell Dustin's coming up with some bullshit statement to blame someone else, or to make it seem like he's innocent or being framed or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 01:55:43 Oh nope, Dragon at least tried to be subtle and feign ignorance, this guy just went up and was blunt with his absurd toxicity
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:03:31 General wasn't muted at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:03:38 Just bugged I guess?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:28:57 I'll erase them for you, just post the first picture with the text, then go one at a time if you don't mind
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:29:18 Or, re-post the last 3 pictures
creations-chat 2018-12-23 02:30:17 There we go, take a look

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:45:19 Warp engines are the term for using magnets to boost your speed to absurd levels
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:45:36 And by absurd, I mean the fastest I've seen is over 2K, vertical, with wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:45:51 Although, that was a while ag- .__.
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:46:00 What, the, hell, rick? That, th- what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:46:09 Wait, is that King's!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 02:46:25 .... <@!287039361944649729> , can you not spam bean please?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:10:36 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:12:11 Because I see shit happening in the Discord server, that's why
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:12:47 I was having a lovely time in the community server, then I see a general shitstorm coming this way, and so I bring out my head pasting stick and head into the storm
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:13:02 A picture of a urinal with a picture of Hilary Clinton in it
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:13:18 The urinal alone I would've bagged you for, the picture?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:15:19 Nice photoshopping
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:15:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:15:45 ... C4RAB, is that you?
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:16:01 Ah, the inspect tool
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:16:15 Nice
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:16:25 2K blocks if I had to guess?

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:19:16 .... <@!525417619583533071> , cut it out, now
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:19:30 That's not that hard, but cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:19:57 .............
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:20:57 Now **CUT IT OUT** __***NOW***__
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:21:10 It looks not half bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:21:41 ..........
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:22:18 <@!525417619583533071> , you're testing my patience here, now quit acting like everything's a joke, that's annoying everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:27:09 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:27:40 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:27:52 Pinged a random guy because he bumped in the list, whops
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:28:21 Now then <@!525417619583533071> AHHEEEMMMMM, you have some explaining to do
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:28:37 Well RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:28:44 I was gonna see his defense, but nope
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:31:33 Might be time to build a pure function craft
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:32:11 It's not **PURE** function, it's got a ton of redundant stuff on it that I can shave off, and I can crank it up to crazy levels
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:33:48 That actually would be a part of the plan
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:34:07 Not the paint, but the wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:34:53 Just any armor block, replace with near zero weight ballast (which is lighter than regular blocks actually), add internal helium for lift, max engines possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:35:10 Basically a controllable thruster cube
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:35:11 And no
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:35:16 Wings create drag
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:35:33 Up to you
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:37:37 .........
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:37:48 Tell him "Unless you want to be banned, delete the creation, now"
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:37:55 Infact, let me tell him personally
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:38:03 Ivan, tell him to can it
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:39:42 Nevermind, either you or he left the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:45:13 The hell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:45:34 PVP server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:46:52 I can't freaking join the server Point
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:08 There's like a billion of those things believe it or not
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:12 They're called warp drives
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:19 And they make absurd levels of speed
creations-chat 2018-12-23 03:51:31 <@!421848903361757184> , that's why we warn people for engine spam of any sort
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:53:36 Point, just tell him he can be banned for that
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:53:51 And yes, we have his username, and yes, we have a banlist that can be updated
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:53:55 I'm aware
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:56:15 They think it's funny, and they can think that all they want, until we (in a game sense) hang them for their crimes
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 03:56:32 **OKAY ENOUGH TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT FOR NOW**
creations-chat 2018-12-23 04:02:16 This is why you don't spam engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:06:28 Just DM it to me, I'm gonna gather it up
help 2018-12-23 04:06:58 Just DM the picture to me
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:10:03 ... To be fully honest <@!168154760866693120> , the color scheme and shape does sorta look like a garbage truck
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:10:29 And you can inflate the size of vehicles in this game
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:10:36 So size doesn't really matter
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:22:31 Wait patiently? I'm not entirely sure, it might be inventor, but that's a VERY far stretch
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:22:37 Well nevermind
help 2018-12-23 04:25:49 Like 1 or 1.5 seconds after they explode
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:31:55 Potatoe, care to permaban the fool?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:15 They can join on alts though
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:18 That's the thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:32:40 Well why don't you try it then Yoko?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:33:06 526229759705743391
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:33:39 Do "!ban (<526229759705743391>) Impersonation of Madattak", I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:34:18 I can't remember the exact sequence for an ID ban
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:34:37 Ahem
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:36:01 It's "!ban <@!(UserID)> (Reason)" I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:36:51 !warn <@!526229759705743391> Testing out a warn for a person that needs to be permabanned
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:36:55 There we go!
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:37:28 "!ban <@!(UserID)> (Reason)"
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:37:55 We're trying to!
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:38:02 The hell?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:38:28 Oh! You have the parenthesis potatoe
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:38:52 "!ban <@!526255273808101386> Mod impersonation"
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:05 Oh what the ffffff
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:15 526229759705743391
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:20 It changed
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:33 Madattak would make a statement
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:51 It'd be "!ban <@!526229759705743391> Madattak impersonation"
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:39:57 Try it one more time potatoe?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:40:31 Specifically, adding spaces in between, "!ban < ! @ 526229759705743391 > Madattak impersonation"
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 04:41:10 It'd be alot easier if he was still in the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:46:42 Guys, just cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:46:59 I can't, fucking believe I have to come on when I'm about to turn off for the night to **THIS**
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:47:06 ALL OF YOU CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:47:43 Right, now then, one at a time, and calmly, without throwing a hissy fit, DM me your side of the story, with as little bias as possible, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:48:12 God damn it
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:48:38 Tornado, don't
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:49:00 Just, DM me what happened, on your side, as little bias, hate, racial, whatever, you get the point
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:49:32 I'll listen to both sides and see who I need to fucking maul, now then, good night, if I see another argument on here I'm gonna slap someone's jaw into their rear
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:49:49 Yes, DMs are open, so go for it, be as calm, non-agressive, etc as possible, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:50:29 If I see you lobbing name calling I'm going to slam DMs shut, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:50:44 Yes, it should be over
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:51:26 I'm not asking for total unbiased opinions, I'm asking for as little bias as possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 05:54:36 I'm gonna read over everything, see what I should do, to who, and why
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:08:14 "I CAME IN LIKE A WREECKING BA-" no, but anyways, I'm still working it out, it seems like it's calming down now
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:08:52 I'm talking about the tension after the argument
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:22:19 Not again, Yoko, come on, it was probably an accident or something, just blacklist if you don't want people interfering with your build, it's what I do, even if a friend's on
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 06:22:48 Right, now I'm signing off, seeya
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 20:29:30 Congrats Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 20:44:21 Looks like someone's making an outline for a B2, or they're just trying to make a fighter style B2 or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 20:46:08 Probably enough to bend steel
the-dump 2018-12-23 21:17:47 .............
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:36:01 
help 2018-12-23 21:44:14 <#491710474786832394> , you need a rank to do so however
help 2018-12-23 21:44:33 The main reason is because we've had a few, issues, with new people suggesting the same thing multiple times over to absurdity
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:45:24 We're going to need height for rockets, but they don't need width or length usually, unless they're folding
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:45:43 For planes and most other vehicles however, you don't have tall creations, so you don't need to adjust the height for them
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:45:47 Keep that in consideration
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:46:37 That might be good for rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:47:22 Well, if you're blacklisted and it's that high, then just don't fly in that area
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:47:30 Plus you're directed forwards anyways, which shouldn't bump into any blacklist walls
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:48:29 I was thinking just make it opaque honestly
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:48:38 Like, make the blacklist box opaque
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:48:41 That way people can't copy
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:49:03 Like, **JUST AS AN EXAMPLE**, let's say doom's copying me, I could blacklist him, and suddenly with that opaque box, he can't copy me
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:49:27 It's just an example
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 21:55:12 Not yet, but it's planned
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 22:34:18 Sorta, but I mean like solid blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-23 22:34:24 So people can't copy
the-dump 2018-12-24 00:07:33 As long as it abides to the rules
the-dump 2018-12-24 00:08:21 Sound warning next time?

plane-crazy 2018-12-24 02:46:28 Uhhh, very quickly, if anyone knows C4RAB1NE, please tell him to CUT THIS SHIT OUT
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 02:46:55 That's not me, that's C4RAB1NE impersonating me
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 02:47:49 Empire, trust me, people can get completely ruined by this
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 02:48:36 Empire, are you honestly serious right now?
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:19:35 I saw it before
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:20:04 Replicator you need upvotes for
creations-chat 2018-12-24 03:20:10 But technician you definitely got
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:39:54 ...........
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:40:02 <@!514968739452813322> , are you shitting me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:40:08 I am not, in the mood for this
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:40:35 Now get the fuck out
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:41:04 I'm not in the mood to deal with this to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:41:16 ... Tell him "That's because the game hasn't updated, yet"
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:55:24 European dragon, not Asian dragon
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:55:45 Welp, alright then
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 04:57:34 It's pretty nice but, er, why all the dragon things!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:01:21 Public servers I'm guessing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:01:36 Right, show me proof he's copying
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:02:52 Also if it's a PVP server, I can't clobber his face since I can't join specific people
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:03:18 And trust me, I've tried
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 05:08:56 Is DSH seriously copying?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:38:51 ... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:39:29 Wait, it is an alt
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:40:27 Still takes a while to create a new VPN, and eventually he'll make himself stand out like a red flag
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:41:43 Immediately message us if he starts DMing you people, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:50:50 We might be getting raided, batten down the hatches everyone?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:52:30 Finally a regular user, hello Charlie
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:53:05 ..........
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:53:29 <@!476107176457273354> , copying without permission is bannable, unless you get permission from the original owner
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:53:39 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:53:44 Then feel free to do so
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:53:57 But only for Lior's specified creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:54:10 Nah, copying off of tutorials just means you're b ad, but we don't ban that
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:54:28 FFS, we're definitely being raided
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:55:53 Alt raiding ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:56:58 Ehheehhhhhhh, about that
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:57:10 There's, stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:57:15 Oh FOR F-
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:57:34 It's alt accounts rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:57:44 Give us permission to start taking action!
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:58:20 RIIIICK!
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:58:32 Don't try it lior
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:58:58 Ignore it Charle, we're being alt raided
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:59:35 Right, that's it, potatoe, you know what to do, blame it on me if it bugs Rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 16:59:56 YOU'RE AN ADMIN, WE DON'T HAVE THE COMMAND
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:00:13 Only admins can permaban, duhdoy, why do you think I've been sitting here without ripping off his hea- oh
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:00:30 "!ban <@526806005242265610> Alt activity
Do that
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:00:58 Tornado, TTS is active, it's just that not alot of people bother using it
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:01:31 Right, with luck that should get rid of him for good
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:01:39 UHHHHH
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:01:51 Right, <@!217336009455566848> , we need to shut down the invites, now
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:02:52 <@!476107176457273354> , sorry, you caught us at a bad time
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:03:00 We're being alt raided, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:03:16 Because I wanted to direct it at you in a response to that GIF or whatever it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:03:31 Usually we're doing better, but alt raids, well, you can guess
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:04:02 IT IS ON
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:05:27 Right, max security temporarily, you need a verified phone
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:07:51 Calm down about TTS, it was just on for a moment temporar-
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:10:59 Right, role call, who's here and who isn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:11:40 I'm doing it because whoever doesn't respond is probably unable to swap back to their account in time
general 2018-12-24 17:12:33 .... <@!521031433972744193> , you wouldn't happen to be the one making alts and bugging us, would you?
general 2018-12-24 17:13:48 Because SOME idiot in the server decided to start sending hate messages to the rest of the server, so now only verified people can talk in <#384021699466756107>
general 2018-12-24 17:14:08 Er, not verified, ranked people, whops
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:21:13 Heyo SirNoHate/Love, clever alt (or, is it an alt?)
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:21:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:21:32 Aaaahhhh, got it
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:23:25 At the same time though, we do know it's someone here, and no alts have popped on ever since you started typing
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:23:32 Fuck my life, nevermind
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:24:50 I did call in the Calvary (The actual Discord team), because it did actually worked before in erasing a troll off the face of Discord, so hopefully it'll work now
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:25:06 It means someone was banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 17:25:37 It came on as he was typing, so it's not him
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 18:48:11 ........ I'll take care of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 18:48:49 He can come back on this day when he's 13
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 18:58:16 He was underage
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 18:58:24 And was spamming gifs in <#384021699466756107> to be banned
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 18:59:21 1's from the bot
help 2018-12-24 21:03:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:25:12 That's a really nice minigun
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:25:56 Maybe a magnet mechanism to eject the "shells" as you release them via disconnectors?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:26:34 I meant it'd drag the belt inside, eject bits of it out the other side via magnets
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:29:33 Resizing would be incredibly hard to do, as it's hard-coded, would mess with mechanisms, and apparently would cause alot of lag, but as Rick has proven, he can break through hard coding, such as the height limit, so I honestly wouldn't put it against him to have a working resize tool within a week or something like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:31:29 The thing is, Plane Crazy was never meant to be worked upon, yet here we are with Rickje the magic dev
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:32:28 Back in the day, strongest engine we had were 1X1X2 jet engines, and we only had 1X2 wing panels, and the longest wedge we had was 1X2, everything else was 1X1, except for beams
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:32:48 No paint either by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:33:02 Basically, and now look at what it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:34:00 I'd say the game currently
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:34:16 Also, you never know Orange, remember how Rick said he could change the height limit on plots?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:34:46 Yeah, so that's 1 bit of hard coding broken
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:35:16 Honestly if PC2 was out (And I had money), I'd shove 1K robux in Rick's face just to get in
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:35:46 Okay no spamming please
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:36:07 **HEY, NO SPAMING PLEASE**
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:36:27 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:36:56 Oh god are we starting another "rickje?" thing again?
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 21:37:51 Honestly this is sorta why I deal with the generic crapstorms that happen every so often
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 22:33:54 <@!163234908578381826> , look at Light Speed
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 22:34:53 Okay, we get it, you're fast
help 2018-12-25 00:02:58 Magnets repel anything that they're pointed at, soooo
general 2018-12-25 00:12:10 As long as they abide to the rules, and aren't meme or joke style videos, joke styles go to <#495286269459300364> and need to abide by the rules to
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:33:21 Looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:35:50 I mean, the scifi department needs more love to be honest, everyone's just replicating crud
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:39:31 Yeup
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:39:48 Scifi appreciation time

creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:40:17 
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:40:33 Yes I am deleting them off of <#384025409945337856> because I already posted them there before, what do you think
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:41:44 Yeah, there's honestly little love for original designs to be perfectly honest
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:42:45 Trust me, I make stuff ludicrously functional, like, "Has to at least be able to maneuver combat-worthily" levels of functionality
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:06 HAH! Helium, I only used it on one creation, the Stiletto, the middle one, and that's because I wanted to make a zero gravity fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:21 Same here
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:46 Think of it as negative mass
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:43:53 Also, wing spam and a very good design Imperial
creations-chat 2018-12-25 01:47:30 <#519624169730605086>
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:08:23 The heck are you talking about!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:08:44 
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:41:28 How maneuverable is it actually?
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:41:53 Wait, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:42:03 Oh wait I just realized how tiny it is
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:42:21 Yeaahhhh, tiny crafts are stupidly maneuverable, but stupidly fragile to
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:42:41 Yeup, that thing, being a MK1, is pretty bad to be perfectly honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:44:05 To be honest Farollo, it's main flaw is that it's got so few parts
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:44:26 One good hit from a missile or one bit of focusing enough and it'll get split to pieces
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:45:47 Compared to the Wyvern (This craft) or Imperial's, freaking brick levels of durable 747
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 02:45:58 Maybe not quite as maneuverable, but there's no way in hell you're taking them down
help 2018-12-25 17:55:30 You're sitting in one of the seats, duh
general 2018-12-25 18:15:35 The King Dragon's about 1.4K, think that'll do, or does it have to be 2-4K creations?
general 2018-12-25 18:16:00 Blocks
general 2018-12-25 18:16:10 Wait, size comparison?
general 2018-12-25 18:17:21 Well, obviously, you've seen this
general 2018-12-25 18:17:28 
general 2018-12-25 18:17:32 
general 2018-12-25 18:17:56 It's basically the answer to, "I need this thing to die, and I need it to die now"
general 2018-12-25 18:18:17 Er, no, sadly not
general 2018-12-25 18:18:35 I can just make a crazy huge borg cube quickly if you want
general 2018-12-25 18:29:12 Welp, huh
general 2018-12-25 18:48:37 Probably because you suggested something absolutely stupid or that has already been suggested before and is on the list, or have spammed out low quality suggestions, something within that category
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 18:51:14 <@461111372239994881> , can you move to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with that for crud's sake?
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 18:51:31 That's like the 30th time you've posted "I'M DOING A RAID" on here ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 19:44:44 I feel like this is accurate

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 01:07:05 ............... Can the two of you delete all of that, now?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 01:07:19 That means you to <@!224513422161739776>
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 01:08:06 There is, but Rick actually extended it from a previous limit
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 01:08:31 ... <@!224513422161739776> Do you mind deleting your posts and responses to spooky before I warn you for them and delete them for you?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 01:08:55 Thank you
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:11:57 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:13:10 Right, 2 things, 1: Can you not <@456226577798135808> ? We get enough crap from trolls as it is, so unless you want us to file you in as the same kind, can you please not be annoying?
2: We have <#497142796961054721> and <#495286269459300364> for a reason, so hopefully new people can be more organized
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:14:16 What do you mean Point?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:14:28 Show the F9 log then?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:15:02 ... <@456226577798135808> , I said, can you cut it out, and quit being effing rude to every single person that even remotely interacts with anyone else within this particular channel?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:15:40 Trust me Point, it's probably Roblox's end
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:16:05 ..... <@456226577798135808> , something tells me you're just here to antagonize people
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:17:23 "Trying to be nice"
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:17:38 *"Trying to be nice"*
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:17:53 __***"TRYING TO BE NIIIICE"***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:18:19 I can smell the sarcasm and feel the hypocriticality from here
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:18:41 Not you Kratos, you're fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:19:26 If complex words make me sound like a sociopath, then quite frankly every single politician, lawyer and linguistical person in the history of Mankind needs a new word for how sociopathic they are
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:20:03 And if you've been living outside of your own fictional "I rule everything" mentality for even a second, you'd realize that they're not sociopathic, at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:20:11 Now then, remember your request for a mute?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:20:39 Wish granted asshat, now befone
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:23:23 You can only wait for Rick to come on and analyze it, and hope it's fixable soon, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:24:25 I'm willing to bet it's wifi or Roblox, considering nobody (Or at the very least nobody I can see) has mentioned this problem

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 05:26:32 I'm gonna just ultimatum it by bringing the King Dragon over to kick some faces into some rears

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:16:43 Hey, I did a ton of drifting ya know!
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 06:16:54 Anyways, g'night
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:36:00 There's a thing called <#497142796961054721> and <#495286269459300364> you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:37:32 ... <@!323133029167923200> , there is a thing, called <#497142796961054721> , and <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:37:46 Can you please not mention, whatever the hell you're mentioning, in this particular channel?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:37:54 We're trying to keep some semblance of organization here
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:38:52 It's fine, also, <@!469155500026494977> , do you mean VTOL, not vtool? Unless vtool means vectorizing tool or something, you probably mean VTOL, Vertical Takeoff Or Landing (I've heard it spelled as Vertical TakeOff and Landing as well though)
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:04:14 Excuse me <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:05:34 This is what I'm referring to
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:05:39 Now don't be an idiot, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:06:04 Leave it be guys ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:23:41 .... You do realize we disabled mentions of everyone because they are SERIOUSLY ANNOYING and cause practical riots to happen, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:23:56 It's called common internet courtesy, now just wait for someone to answer it
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:24:12 Or look online to see what works, then mimic that, because if it works in the real world, 99% of the time it works in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:50:54 .... <@!455021038724710411> , you need a better reason than "hes recording"
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 19:51:14 Because anyone can record, unless he's a well known youtuber, not quite worth his time, considering it's time taken out of Rick's development for future updates
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:16:03 Ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:16:15 Also, <@!216371990959882241> , can you please not post that? People are annoyed/bugged by it
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:18:59 ?

help 2018-12-28 20:21:07 Jet spamming causes lag, more lag than block spam, less lag than another kind of spam which I won't say, but it's not allowed, as it's unoriginal, requires little to no effort, and is a malicious act against other users
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:21:44 UHHHH, yeaahhhh, I was gonna stab you for that, but that is a possible bug
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:22:06 1500 main pilot seats, that could cause issues on spawn decision
help 2018-12-28 20:22:38 Just post pictures of them and we'll take actions when we can (Mad for some reason doesn't like moderation since he's worried that we'll go out of control with it)
help 2018-12-28 20:23:15 So, 500+ means at least 500 blocks
help 2018-12-28 20:24:44 Tell him "Message from a mod, JamesonMdrago, that action is bannable, and you will be banned if you do not cut it out now"
help 2018-12-28 20:25:11 (Currently that's a bluff, but don't tell him that, I've spooked people enough to stop them building bad things before with bluffs)
help 2018-12-28 20:25:38 Don't copy the second part of course

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:33:47 <@505820771378135060> EXPLAIN, NOW!!!
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:33:53 Better yet
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:38:37 Point, try connecting two wedges together on an empty surface
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:38:45 They aren't quite meshes, but they're something within that area
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:38:56 Tell him "You get good and quit trying to copy me"

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:41:45 Replace that pistol with this Imperial
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:41:56 That's my stance on copying
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:51:23 Can someone seriously tell whoever's making those creations, he's not impressing anyone, he's just making slightly larger tutorial style planes, which is frowned upon?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:51:32 The "SPEEDBOAT" or "BOEING" creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:52:08 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:58:45 Soooo, <@505820771378135060> , why exactly did you continuously bug me about trying to copy my creation?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:59:01 Yes, I know it's you by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 20:59:29 Dark, just drop it
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:00:10 You literally brought up that you made a fighter to stand up against mine, infact

plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:11:54 <@!324013078444245003> , can you PLEASE tell him/her to cut the crap out?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:12:00 I remember you mentioned you knew them
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:12:15 Then tell them to cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:12:42 Empire, as far as I know it's supposed to be an IP ban, plus they did type at the same time at certain points
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:12:56 So, I seriously doubt they're the same person, but if it is, welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:14:15 Empire, that wouldn't really explain how both typed at the same time
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:14:38 Plus even if they're the same person, the typing style's pretty different
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:14:45 Meh, I'll leave it to you guys to be honest
help 2018-12-28 21:48:38 First of all, set them to auto controls and see which directions they go
You want them to be as far away from the center of mass as possible, with their respective movement, so you want pitch panels near the front and back, yaw near the top and bottom, and roll near the wing tips
help 2018-12-28 21:49:22 Demonstrating with my Wyvern fighter, the control panels near the edge of the wings are roll, while the ones near the front are for pitch, the tail (which you can't see), is entirely dedicated to yaw
help 2018-12-28 21:52:53 Control panels also work better at higher speeds
help 2018-12-28 21:58:27 It actually doesn't
help 2018-12-28 21:58:51 Only wing panels mimic any sort of aerodynamics, and even then it's moreso a "go fast, create upwards force" thing
help 2018-12-28 22:00:05 The slightest amount of imbalancing will make it start tilting, and engines near the back (or bottom in this case), make it more susceptible to instabilities
help 2018-12-28 22:00:12 ... <@!476231567971188736> , no, that won't work
help 2018-12-28 22:00:27 This isn't Kerbal Space Program, blocks aren't affected by aerodynamics
help 2018-12-28 22:01:04 It's literally the imbalance on your central seat that's amplified by the vulnerability to instability
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:01:21 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:01:24 That's the most help you're getting
help 2018-12-28 22:01:47 ... <@!476231567971188736> , this is a **GAME**
help 2018-12-28 22:02:19 It's not a real life physics simulation, if you want that, the closest thing you're probably going to get is KSP
help 2018-12-28 22:03:27 You get the point, the only objects that are affected by aerodynamics are wings, and even then they only cause drag and lift when moving sufficiently fast enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:13:59 ............
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:14:05 Both of you, cut it out
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:29:39 ......... <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:30:52 No, you won't put it anywhere, at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:31:07 And I'll warn you and shove you into the trash compactor
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:31:11 It's highly bannable
the-dump 2018-12-28 22:31:32 Try that again and see what happens <@456226577798135808> , rules still apply here
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:31:57 If you ping someone accidentally, and delete it, it still appears as a ghost ping
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:32:12 So basically just stand your ground and go "Sorry, accident"
the-dump 2018-12-28 22:33:30 You are very, very lucky it's me, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:58:14 I'll give it a shot
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:58:43 If the person allows you to copy their creation, like I did with Ignacioel and Imperial, they'll be allowed to copy
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:59:09 If they don't give permission however, you are not allowed
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 22:59:20 Ready Rick
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:01:53 Er, it's obvious, JamesonMdrago
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:04:43 The D is not a capital letter
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:35:49 You tell me Alvin, I'm struggling here to
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:36:13 How about a functional scifi cockpit then?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:36:36 Er, not opening canopy, but like very durable
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:37:04 Meanwhile I had to teach myself on wedge design
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 23:45:14 For parts or for controls?
help 2018-12-28 23:54:03 Pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right) or roll (clock/counter)?
help 2018-12-29 00:03:29 You want a larger tail fin control surface, and have them as far infront or behind the center of mass as possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:05:00 Can someone honestly smack some sense into Toxeed? He's really toxIC with his clickbait stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:05:28 Alright, good
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:10:05 What do you mean by thrust limit?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:11:33 Not yet, and that has been suggested in <#507673335816126509> by the way
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:13:31 Do a green screen of the green screen and just put infinite cursors on there
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:14:28 Take a screenshot of the current greenscreen, then post it on the next greenscreen, and do it again and again until it's only cursors
help 2018-12-29 00:24:42 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:31:59 ALVIN, we get it
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 00:32:07 That's literally the demand every single day, every update
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:57:48 It now says who posted what
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:57:55 So, I think you can go out of order, they'll just look at the names
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:58:01 There's 3 sets of skis, and 1 new wheel
creations-chat 2018-12-29 00:58:28 It's nice
creations-chat 2018-12-29 01:01:31 It's nice
help 2018-12-29 01:11:57 No Jelly, just post it and Rick will add them to a ban list
help 2018-12-29 01:12:23 Alright, it's ineffective anyways compared to other things they could be doing
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:13:26 Meh, not me
help 2018-12-29 01:13:42 What do you need help with?
help 2018-12-29 01:14:39 Either lag, or it's too light

general 2018-12-29 01:20:34 ....
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:23:50 I think people are just lazy to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:26:18 Show the actual creation <@!194241218811658240> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:26:22 Also change the PFP please
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:26:54 ............
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:27:23 It is actually, check <#384025409945337856> and search "shuttle"
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:27:31 The wing design matches
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:27:59 See?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:28:30 Trebox, he's got the same wing design
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:28:35 That's usually the most distinct part of creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:29:57 Prime example: You wouldn't mistake this thing for anyone else's (Imperial and Ignacioel are allowed to copy this however)
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:30:11 Show me it fully submerged?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:31:58 Done
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:32:17 Don't make stupid suggestions by the way, and always check <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , and their various pins
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:33:23 Let's see both?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:36:15 I can tell the carrier can fit people on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:36:28 Hey guess what? You have a crazy ton of ranks now
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:36:29 Enjoy
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:36:44 Treb, try adding tail fins near the back, and maybe give it a bit of a spin, and add rockets near the front
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:36:58 What do ya mean tank? You have the ranked rank!
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:37:11 Integ, you already have the highest rank for steampunk with that giant blimp!
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 01:37:33 You get the point
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 02:29:55 Also, it's already planned
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:23:11 I think it's gotta be something in the real world, not in games or movies
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:31:29 Snow based engines?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:31:33 Sorta like snowblowers?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:35:19 ....... <@!415647367451377665> None of that
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:35:51 There are kids here dude, and we have rules for reasons, for very good reasons infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:42:56 ...........

plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:43:43 NEXT PERSON TO SPEAK ABOUT COMMUNISM GETS A WARN, GOT IT!?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:43:51 At least do it on <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:46:51 Oh fuck my, <@!336263560533377047> , **CHANGE IT, NOW**
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:47:24 Wait the f- .......
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:47:59 Even if it is photoshopped, it's still an NSFW image
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:49:25 You do realize you only have one warning, right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:49:33 If you were bullied, we'd pick on you for the slightest things ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:55:31 E+(digit) means it has that many digits
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:55:57 So 1E+4 means 10000, I think
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:56:09 Either 1000 or 10000
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 03:56:13 I think so
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 04:24:32 ......................
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 04:30:34 ..................................................... <@!355123674954858496>
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 04:30:49 Did you, **SERIOUSLY** have to spam that symbol literally everywhere?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:34:21 ...............
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:34:37 Close to 13, or?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:35:16 <@!287348977618124800> **HEY, GET OVER HERE AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF, NOW**
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:35:55 ... Wait for him to explain himself, if he starts DMing people, boot him immediately
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:36:51 Just shove it into <#498473314445033472> without pinging him
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:37:01 He'll pick it up, if I were to guess he has notifications on there, sooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:39:04 <@!287348977618124800> , explain yourself https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/6472fdcfb504e1d1a4ba1a9a92ab73ec-png.jpg
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:39:29 ....... Keep him in, if you're lying though, it ain't gonna be a tempban, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:40:00 If you're far under 13, admit it now and you'll be allowed on when you're 13, but lie about it and you're gonna be banned permanently, got it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:41:15 Dude, <@!287348977618124800> , the rules apply to DMs, so if he shows it, it's not really being a traitor moreso he's just trying to make sure you don't screw something up
creations-chat 2018-12-29 17:44:46 Isn't that a tutorial plane?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:45:21 ... You're kidding, right <@!465288266376282112> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:45:41 I'm sorry, but it's Discord Terms of Service, I have to ask you to leave until you're 13
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:46:01 And yes, I know, this is a Roblox server, we exist in some weird nebulous bubble here, so don't question it
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:47:43 Show me your vehicle Leo?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:48:09 ..... <@!465288266376282112> , can you please leave? We need to abide by Discord Terms of Service whenever applicable
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:48:25 Alright, show me it hovering Leo
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:50:00 <@!287348977618124800> You now have technician
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:50:34 HOLD ON A MOMENT GUYS JESUS H CHRIST
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:50:50 Just send me screenshots of your vehicle and the requested rank via DMs
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:51:01 Alvin, we're allowing him since he's gonna be 13 in 3 days
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:12:38 Tester on site
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:12:46 Floating car fight?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:12:52 Or, more like falling car fight actually
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 18:27:39 Hold on, testing for another game as well, sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 19:37:13 <@!292677396929183755> , AHEEMMM
help 2018-12-29 19:52:39 Can you not use .wmv files?
help 2018-12-29 19:52:50 They're problematic in that they can house viruses
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 20:52:03 Alright **WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON GUYS!?**
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 20:52:40 Can we please calm it down and condense messages into longer ones? Like this one is? Rather than a bunch of tiny short bursts?
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 20:53:02 That'd be easier to read for everyone to be perfectly honest
general 2018-12-29 21:49:03 ... Seriously <@373585820436660226> ? Can you not with those cheap jokes, some people are gullible enough to fall for it and not realize it's a joke
general 2018-12-29 21:54:43 There's a thing called Google you know
creations-chat 2018-12-30 04:38:59 You sure that's a submarine and not a fighter?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:39:35 What, the actual, fuck? I actually feel sick from seeing that
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:39:44 <@377596437283995660> , do you mind deleting it and changing your PFP?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:40:21 As I said, it's making me slightly sick, and it's, more than a bit disturbing
creations-chat 2018-12-30 04:40:32 Too much lift on the back
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:40:41 ... Just change it
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:41:13 I literally made a statement in <#490306593242611742> about requests to change PFPs, now can you PLEASE change it and quit trying to disturb people?
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:41:43 If you want my best explanation, there's an uncanny valley where human-like objects become, very, disgusting, disturbing, what have you, because they just don't look right
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:42:02 Effectively a point where it goes from "inhuman with human-like qualities" to "an imperfect human"
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:42:38 .... <@377596437283995660> , change your PFP and delete the images
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:42:59 Might do durability tests with them
the-dump 2018-12-30 04:43:23 Thank you, it's just, it might just be because of today, but it's really hard to make me sick with stuff
help 2018-12-30 04:47:59 Don't freaking try to ping people, that just pisses off huge servers, hence why we have it disabled
help 2018-12-30 04:48:19 There's a thing called blacklisting you know
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:51:52 Just tell him that it's bannable
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:14:56 .................... Just clear it out up to what tederin typed, that means each of you that caused a problem clean up your own respective mess
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:15:53 .... I seriously can't believe I have to clean up after, faaahhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:16:56 It's called building them in different stages of the rotation
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:18:57 <@!421049901896433665> , I said **CUT IT OUT**
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:19:25 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with it ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:19:56 I'm "that guy" to people who literally don't give a damn about rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:20:14 Plus I even told you to drag it to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> , what makes you a special little snowflake jackass?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:20:30 Then here, have a special warn
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:21:50 Right, for every single person here that witnessed it, we have the rules __FOR__ **A** __***REASON***__
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:25:52 Just try to clamp it down guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:26:15 Weeeeelp
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:26:54 It's still technically within the boundaries of the rules, which is the issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:28:18 For a brief and probably horribly wrong summary of a loophole: It's a way to bypass certain things, usually rules or laws, that don't necessarily break them
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:33:23 Someone kept on making a bunch of "roses are red" poems in here, and I asked them to move, even taking the courtesy of cleaning up after them
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:34:27 And then I turn around for half a second to work on my new design, and they make another poem, and after I bug them about it, he/she/they basically go "__**FUCK THE RULES, I DESERVE MORE THAN ALL OF YOU**__", followed by being rude to me, and thus I warned him, and Imperial muted him
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:35:46 Orange
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:36:11 Well RIP
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:36:17 Also, now make it float Integ
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:36:23 With the balloon and everything
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:36:51 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:38:04 Meanwhile I'm struggling to decide whether to make the new cockpit design on the front, back, or center of my final (for now) craft design
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:38:37 He's still on 2/3
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:44:27 Let's see it <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:45:52 Also, which one's better? (Their positioning is relevant, it's where I'd place them, so for the left one it'd be in the front, for the middle, in the middle)
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:46:34 Like, which one looks better?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:47:02 Alright, yeah, I didn't like the middle one anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:47:44 What are ya talking about TAWO? You already have it!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:47:54 Doctor, use the snipping tool
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:48:35 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:49:36 Snipping's technically a screen capture, soo
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:49:50 Also, SirNo, I already showed the DMs with T33, so
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:05 That's called a well designed fighter
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:19 Here's my flying sub
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:50:31 And as you can see, it's stupidly durable (It can fight like this by the way)
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:51:12 ................
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:51:21 Thank you for that <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:51:34 Ehhhh, that we can't enforce Imperial, although at the same time, seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:51:39 Se- hold on
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:52:21 Doctor, you're fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:52:34 Cong, you can make torpedos, but you need to build them yourself
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:52:53 Linh, we sorta ask people to publicize them if they think that they're being obnoxious or pressured in <#512414682552729601>
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:53:01 No cong, but that won't get you inventor nor modeler
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:53:14 It's fine Doctor
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:53:27 Oh look, there we go
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:54:15 Yes, but he gets on a "second chance" thing, which is basically 3 extra chances
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:54:28 Past that the punishments ramp up in severity, like, exponentially so
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:54:53 Banned people, that's who
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:55:34 Well, they're usually and suppose to be equally vulnerable
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:55:43 Also, we do sorta push them more severely depending on what they do
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:56:08 For example, if someone bot bombs the server (For those that remembered that day), they can be permabanned immediately
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:58:10 Let's just forget that day, like, turbo fast, like, now
Here's how durable my fighter is!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:58:19 It can still fight fiercely in that state
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:58:46 The drifting or the actual plane?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 05:59:08 For prop master, you need to use no engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:59:20 Like "Let's forget it" tederin
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 05:59:39 It wouldn't do the best Onyx
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:00:10 Thin armoring near the wings, unshielded motors, and what looks like one layer of glass blocks to cover the cockpit
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:00:17 Sturdy as hell tail and body though
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:00:56 Well, if the tail engines are unnecessary, and are only for show, you can just knock them off and get prop master
help 2018-12-30 06:01:14 Wat?
help 2018-12-30 06:01:18 What are ya talking about?
help 2018-12-30 06:01:35 You already have it! (Jokes aside, we forgot to give it to ya, whops)
help 2018-12-30 06:02:00 You know the drill, don't suggest anything stupid, always check the pins, don't spam down recent stuff, yada yada
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:15 Use ice blocks, they help a bit
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:20 Offset should be even better
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:02:40 Lower friction
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:03:34 Rockets + tail, I'm gonna core through until I hit the you
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:03:59 Imperial, it's a large as hell plane vs my fighter which can outmaneuver pretty much anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:04:48 I am lag resistant!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:04:57 Not immune, but resistant!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:05:11 Then I'll just use guns and core into ya that way
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:05:30 Yes it'd take forever, but I'd still beat it eventually
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:07:27 Shhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:07:36 You need to find them yourself
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:09:59 Welp, boop
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:10:49 OH HOLD UP, <@!251995895405477888> , no mentioning Trump please, I saw another server literally burn down because of a Trump argument
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:11:54 It's evolved from Plane Crazy to Crazy Crafts
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:13:39 Can't you crank the refresh rate down?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:15:28 Ranks are basically just points, they're to show off
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:15:36 And you only need one rank to suggest things
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:15:52 They do count as a plus for mod applications though
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:16:26 I mean, you built a plane battleship
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:16:50 Like, to be honest there's no denying it, it's a plane, just like this is a plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:19:18 Check <#473249376223887371> to start gathering them!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:20:01 What? What was I supposed to say?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:20:51 You know what, I'm gonna ask to clarify something in <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:21:23 Right, battleship, if what I typed passes, and it submerges vertically, you'll get it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:21:34 Otherwise, nada, sorry, just a plane without wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:21:45 Just build a dedicated sub!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:22:18 Your choice
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:23:16 *coughcough*
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:23:36 From this beautiful thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:23:46 To that nearly dead thing, and yes, it can still fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:23:56 Not Imperial's thing, my thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:24:04 And if you're wondering, yes, it dogfights still, very well infact
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:46:38 Fine, fine, <@!336538005676228610> , bug me about it, it'll eventually be done, and I'm fine with DMs as long as you don't harass me or post something NSFW
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:47:43 We've, had a bad history of people that tried harassing the moderation/administrative team
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 06:49:19 Show me the creation?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 06:53:32 Hey, people can make what they want, although admittedly most people make the B rather than the A
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:02:53 "Nyooooommmmm" levels of speed
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:03:18 I could add it to my final fighter, but that's a stupid idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:03:30 Magnet engines are fragile, really, really fragile
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:03:40 One wrong bump and they can go kaput
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:04:02 Do you see the damage my fighters take? Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 07:04:46 Welp, g'night
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:08:27 It's actually the right person <@318892614378061824> , one of the mods caught it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:09:00 ..... <@318892614378061824> , it's borderline, if not definitely NSFW, in multiple cases
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:09:29 Swiss, I'll give you a hint, a revolver isn't a healthy thing to have pointed at your face no matter what you are
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:10:19 .............
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:10:23 Swiss
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:10:32 Thaaaat's it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:14:03 Actually, wait, looking at <#512414682552729601> , Imperial, you know what to do
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:14:42 514837508627103745 his ID
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:19:19 Don't question it and just let it die Alien
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:19:41 Just know that after alot of people started doing alot of shit, we changed stuff around in <#512414682552729601>
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:20:37 Fatty, it's fine so long as it's not like 90 slides of the same exact creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:21:02 Like, me posting 2 slides per creation for 10 creations is fine, but don't spam out the exact same creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:21:34 In other words, just don't be an idiot with the posting and you'll be fine
general 2018-12-30 18:22:00 Ehhhhh, care to drag it to <#495286269459300364> next time? It's fine this time, but if you'd please next time
general 2018-12-30 18:22:25 Thank ye kindly
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:22:52 Ignore them, it's probably a roleplay or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:23:02 Also is it who I think it is?
the-dump 2018-12-30 18:25:45 Well, try to hold back on spam, but as long as it follows the rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:29:26 If people would quit being stupid, we wouldn't even have to have rules at all, but because people keep on trying to break the server in various ways, we have to enforce rules like these
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:29:54 *An enemy plane appears*
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:36:29 We've been having to crack down on idiots alot, soooo
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:36:38 6 known bots that we use
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:36:53 A unique mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:37:05 It needs to do something that nothing else has ever done before
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:37:39 For example: The first ever swashplate was inventor-worthy, but then someone made it, and it's no longer inventor-worthy
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:37:53 Someone made a tank track, inventor-worthy, after that not anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:38:49 It's not a recently made account, so I'm somewhat doubting it's an alt
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:38:53 But I'll keep an eye on it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:39:01 DM it to me <@460583333630574613> , I'll listen
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:39:14 They don't, because that can lead to serious trolling
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:39:33 Imagine someone making a magnet cube that just absorbs everyone's planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:39:57 They were adding it all along
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:40:18 The issue kube is that it's very hard to prevent glitches
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:40:31 .... We'll, let that one pass
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:42:33 He's actually really nice, it's just that we have to keep people from mass pinging him, because pings can get annoying if they're used in excess
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:44:22 Well, if it's someone breaking the rules in-game, DM one of us (I'm always available), and we'll redirect it to a chat for Rick to take care of when he has available time
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:44:48 Life's turning into a burning crapstorm, but otherwise I'm fine
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:46:14 You don't need to post the rest of it if it's one of the latter velocity ranks, only the fact that you achieved it
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:46:42 From orbital velocity onwards, you only need to achieve the speed, the method upon which you do so does not matter
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:50:45 Plane launcher? You mean catapult system?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:55:11 Post the picture in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:55:29 RIP, just post the blue part
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:55:35 Here, I'll do it for ya
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:55:55 From: ThaioGamer https://streamable.com/s/n35gu/rqqtre
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:56:42 Is that an actual V-12 engine?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:04 Magnets are slightly more complex, but they're easy to read once you get the hang of it
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:20 They attract or repel every single block that their red face is pointed towards
creations-chat 2018-12-30 18:57:30 ?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:58:20 If there's a checkmark over the paint bucket, that means you've selected it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:58:34 If that's not the case, try toggling it on and off again
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:58:41 I believe Rick said nothing will be removed
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:58:49 And it still paints the entire thing Epix?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:59:01 Magmar, you need a rank to prove that you actually understand the game
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:59:05 Rejoin Epix?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 18:59:43 Show it in action?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:00:09 Yes you do Magmar
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:00:30 After alot of bad, repeated and generally trolling suggestions, we had to implement that step so people that actually understood the game could suggest, rather than just random suggestions
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:01:15 <#504436696021204992> , correct Magmar?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:01:36 Oh, an Osprey, they're really common, show the save slot?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:02:22 Did you use any engines inside of it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:03:29 Mmmmmmm, I'll trust you on that
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:04:18 You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:04:29 If you overuse data, your most recent save won't process
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:04:48 So let's say I have 13 creations, and my 14th goes over the save data, it won't save, at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:05:19 Hidear, it should save if you stay within the server
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:05:25 Tim, it's a Roblox limit, we can't do anything about it
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:05:37 As soon as you leave the server however, the save data vanishes
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:06:17 It only gets Lag Machine
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:06:22 SuBie, I'll take you up on that offer
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:06:40 Show the save slot?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:06:45 Oh wait nevermind HOLD ON!
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:07:36 Ready your creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:08:20 ?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:20:53 Huh, never saw that kind of folding
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:21:17 He must've set it to auto
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:21:50 Auto control surfaces adjust to whichever orientation they're placed at
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:22:06 I'm willing to bet that's what happened actually
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:22:33 We know, but does it fly well?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:22:42 You got jammed through the map Dustin, RIP
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:24:47 I mean, to be fair, why do we need to make these crazy contraptions on our planes? Because we're Plane Crazy (Don't shoot me for the joke)
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:26:48 https://cdn.athlonoutdoors.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/05/Empty-Shell-XM556-23.jpg
creations-chat 2018-12-30 19:27:10 Who called in the heavy?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:30:57 Got ammo racked?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:32:28 Ah
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 19:39:15 Who the hell are you anyways?
creations-chat 2018-12-30 21:15:52 That's not inventor worthy, not even close to be honest
creations-chat 2018-12-30 21:16:07 Not modeler worthy, since someone made something like that already
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 18:48:15 Inactivity
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 18:49:49 Something tells me my superfighters are going to eat my computer
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:21:46 Might be caused by alot of point blank explosions, large amount of parts, etc
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:23:13 True
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:23:18 Ask Rick, not me
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 19:38:06 I'm fine Kratos
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 20:23:39 I'm just gonna stay out of this for about an hour or two, don't mind me
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 20:31:03 I'd say before
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 20:31:38 If explosive blocks are 1X1, use 1X1X0.9 blocks, or half blocks to line the interior
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 20:31:50 If not, expand it
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 20:33:07 That should make it easier, or use ice blocks and manually jam them in via pistons or something
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:19:41 You need a rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:20:19 We applied the "you need a rank" thing because people kept on suggesting the same suggestions, alongside generally horrible suggestions
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:31:37 Alright, next person to try to start a furry war, I'm going to take my fighter and blast them to atoms with it
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:31:51 **BOTH SIDES BY THE WAY**
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:32:25 
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:32:28 Did you forget the damage tolerance?
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:32:49 That's what flak is though
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:33:02 Unless you're talking about scatter explosives
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:34:19 I'll just reverse thrust out of the way (All my fighters are capable of flying straight up in reverse)
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:34:26 Oh FML, those tiny tinfoil scraps
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:34:59 Oh wait, the latest variant has rockets on it, so I can actually track the tinfoil scraps pretty well now
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:35:39 Trust me, they are a royal pain in the rear in PVP, I've had to deal with them before
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:36:02 Best strategy is to joust them, because they'll be the most predictable at that point
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:36:26 People tend to just get frustrated trying to copy giant builds
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:36:44 I tried that sh15, they're so small that when the missiles converged on them, they missed
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:37:08 He tried copying off of everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:37:20 Best strategy to avoid copying: Internal mechanisms
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:37:29 They have to guess what you did for the internals, and they won't be able to lift off the ground
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:38:08 For the level of performance on my fighter, I have a (redacted for security) amount of (redacted)
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 21:38:36 It won't be anywhere near as fast Linh
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:11:26 Alright, good luck on that
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 22:14:19 I think he means so that he can drop them individually
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:19:34 You don't need to post it multiple times
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:19:51 Anyways, now for the copy and paste message I always have to say because people always forget about it

You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:21:18 At least if someone screws up now linh, I can point out that I told them that and beat their face (in this case their ability to suggest) in with a spiked club
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:27:27 That, won't apply, at all, in the slightest Bacon
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:28:03 It's gotta be fully sealed (or have a door that can close), and be able to maneuver in all directions, including strafing up and down
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 23:28:09 Yeaahhhh, I'm asking Xpert to change that
help 2018-12-31 23:28:17 <#519624169730605086>
help 2018-12-31 23:30:03 We've had to implement the ranked/unranked system after alot of people kept on doing, things, without ranks (most notably, they kept on suggesting the same suggestion without even bothering to think about what they were suggesting)
help 2018-12-31 23:30:23 ?
help 2018-12-31 23:30:34 Use the screwdriver to tweak their weight
help 2018-12-31 23:30:48 You can actually make them lighter than normal blocks, but heavier than helium, if you tweak their weight accordingly
help 2018-12-31 23:31:06 Or you can just make them ridiculously heavy if you tweak it to be heavy
help 2018-12-31 23:32:53 Sadly no, although I think Rick's already gonna try to fix that
help 2018-12-31 23:33:42 Yeup
help 2018-12-31 23:33:50 Actually, it's the reverse helium that can be adjusted
creations-chat 2018-12-31 23:34:11 I heard that that was a tutorial sub, although I'm not sure, gonna let the others decide on that one
help 2018-12-31 23:36:06 I think if you're clever about it, although I don't know, I haven't messed with ballasts myself

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:17:14 Ah, a solid state VTOL, not exactly the most impressive thing, but still pretty impressive nonetheless
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:17:26 What grabs eyes are motorized VTOLs
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:18:47 Already planned
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:18:53 Infact, potentially in progress
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:19:04 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:19:23 Uhhh, <@!356059618583248907> , change your PFP and tag if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 01:25:59 Integ, that's less so engine failure and moreso "You've been ammo racked, except your ammo rack's a TARDIS of ammo"
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:51:16 ..... next "no u" gets an XM556 through their skull
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:51:36 God damn it, YOU GET THE POINT
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:02 Might I point out, that? All of that infact
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:52:42 If it hovers using helium and little to no engine power (including motors), that's fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:53:02 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:53:10 Right, all of you, line up, one at a time
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:53:18 Battleship, they're moved around a bit, dunno who did it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:53:36 Serious, quit siding on t33's side unless you know what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:53:48 T33, you did cause a variety of arguments and such, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:54:06 Jip, that's, damn, propmaster worthy and steampunk engineer worthy, nice one
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:54:19 ... So you're an anarchist serious?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:54:35 It's not us
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:54:41 Jip, post a block count?

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:55:40 ........ Both of you, just cut it out and drop it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:56:04 Alright, slowmode's annoying
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:56:24 ... <@!421049901896433665> , I said, it's not us, if you didn't notice, WE REMOVED SLOWMODE
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:56:46 <@!249514440330838016> , post a picture of the save slot if you'd please

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:57:49 Jip, you've got the steampunk engineer rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:58:33 ... Linh, serious, enough about communism, I think we're genuinely getting sick of the daily communism, what can only be described as barf, on here
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:59:17 ... T33, memes go to <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:59:35 And incase you haven't noticed, "pepe" is literally the face of memes
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 02:59:57 !warn
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:00:04 Don't make me serious, rule 2 applies you know
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:00:18 We had to crank up it's severity after people kept on trying to borderline evade it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:01:17 Trust me serious, people made it bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:01:39 Just blame all the (excuse my language) fucking shitheads before you that kept on ruining it until we had to consider it

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:04:38 Christianity isn't controversial unless you push it on people, if you go "I'm Christian", and someone goes "I'm Buddhist", that's fine, but if you go "I'm Christian and no other religion is right", then we'll bring down the hammer, got it?

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:16:44 ... I come on, and I see a picture of a woman with almost nothing on hanging from the bottom of a plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:17:36 I don't give a damn if it's a mannequin unless it's close enough that you can tell it's a mannequin
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:17:55 Just feel lucky that I'm not bugging Imperial to permaban you on the grounds of rule 2, because it's hard to tell what it is

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:59:57 Thank you
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:17 Looks nice Integ
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:36 My best fighter's the Fighter MK3 Wyvern
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:01:01 It's huge, yet it maneuvers really well
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:01:13 Clocks at 510, 520 level
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:09 It can also pull up and loop around within the spawn area (not the build plot, the thing the build plot is on)
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:20 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:25 Whyyyyyyyyyy?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:03:03 Also, yes I know Sea, I engineered it to be like that, and it can fit missiles on the ends of the wings to
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:03:19 And here's the damage capacity, while still remaining combat capable
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:03:54 But can the 747 maneuver fast enough to tail someone with that much damage?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:05:18 I mean, hey, compared to this, which has missiles and can probably fit ANY future gun that Rick ever implements
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:05:54 Imperial, remember the weight capacity one of my fighters had?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:06:26 The MK1 could do this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363606144483338/Capture_63.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:06:53 It's my MK1 fighter, the Wyrm
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:06:59 Carrying 3 HUUUUGE bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:08 Salamander
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:37 The point of that experiment was to see just how much weight it could carry
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:43 So I jammed as many ballasts on as possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:07:56 I already have a MK4, the Dragon
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:16 Mk5 is the King Dragon
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:27 I won't spoil the MK6's name, but it's going to be different from the rest
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:08:50 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:09:03 This one isn't, spoilers
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:09:51 Drake would be the peak of tank tech if I ever bother to start making tanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:10:03 Again, not dragon, or even scaled creature related
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:10:28 "or even scaled creature related", lizards are scaled
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:11:01 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:11:22 Notice how I say MK6, not MK6 fighter, MK6 interceptor, or MK6 anything specific
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:14:46 I will give, ONE hint, it might be smaller than the King Dragon in terms of block count actually, infact it's probably definitely smaller
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:15:59 You know what, I'm just gonna show my whole lineup

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:19:33 Surprisingly enough, the King Dragon's actually more durable than the Goliath, but the Goliath's cheaper, and lore-wise it's larger, so it can fit bigger guns and equipment
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:20:15 Heh, nah, most fragile thing's that Imperial, except if you piss off my friends
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:01 Someone posing as me I believe
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:18 Wait, the heck?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:21:26 Oh what the actual hell?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:22:01 Yeup, still got all my ancient ranks, so I don't think I left the server even once, huuuuuhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:22:50 Wait wait wait wait what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:22:59 Septemberish
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:23:20 The bots are confused
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:25:00 I don't think I left actually, I think I got some of my ranks, including Inventor and Ace Pilot early
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:25:19 Infact, I know I got Ace Pilot early, because I got it on the Wyrm, which was WAAAYYYY back when
general 2019-01-01 04:25:38 What do you mean? Like, prevent them from entering your plot?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:27:03 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:27:37 Okay I was definitely here during the entirity of October, what the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:28:39 The actual!? Huuuhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:29:56 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:29:59 That might explain it
help 2019-01-01 04:30:22 How so?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:30:27 Problem in <#478584971670454284>
help 2019-01-01 04:30:46 He's probably ragdolled ontop of the box, or standing on it
help 2019-01-01 04:30:52 Disable then re-enable it, see if he falls through
help 2019-01-01 04:30:55 Or is he genuinely flying?
help 2019-01-01 04:34:10 I'm gonna see if I can catch him doing so
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:41:33 Does anyone have a contact with a user going by the name of C4RAB1NE? He's changed his Discord username to match mine, possibly to try to impersonate me
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:42:41 __**FUCK**__, god, I need someone to knock his fucking head in with a steel mace
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:43:24 
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:43:53 Orange, tell him that if someone else doesn't find him, I will, and I will make sure every single fucking living day of his is suffering, until he's begging for me to kill him
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:44:43 *Ahem, cough* Anyways, murderous side of me over, Gabe, use the screwdriver tool and go over blocks, any that get highlighted by it, click on it, see if it's the anchor block
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:45:49 It's not alcoholism, now can we drop it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:46:31 But seriously, Orange, can you find him and tell him to quit changing his username to mine before I bug every single branch of service I can contact to get him banned, or potentially arrested even?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:54:48 Stop talking about nuts before I grab an industrial nutcracker

plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:25:22 RIP, this is why you thoroughly think about how people would use it reblex
creations-chat 2019-01-01 06:01:30 Oh, about copying?
creations-chat 2019-01-01 06:18:59 Holy shit, that's your FIRST!? ._.
creations-chat 2019-01-01 06:21:47 Who else? Heli guy here
creations-chat 2019-01-01 06:22:13 I meant like vehicle department in general
creations-chat 2019-01-01 06:23:50 I mean, there's an upwards progression of design quality, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 19:42:23 "Hiii, the ocean"
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 19:42:33 Nice fighter by the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 19:42:51 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 19:50:20 Ah, huh, that's pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:05:03 What's the issue?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:07:31 Nosedives, pulls up too hard, won't turn, or what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:08:37 Show the amount of parts?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:09:13 You know, actually, I'll just give it to ya, I know how freaking narrow Subie's carrier is
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:09:44 Like, even I struggle with it many times, and alot of people can attest to how floaty my fighter is
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:09:53 ................
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:10:14 <@!261228937206562817> , 1: Off topic please, 2: Can you change the PFP so you don't mimic Orangeskii's?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:10:46 Well, if Orange asks you to change it, please do so if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:10:56 So, Jamie, you might have the center of lift too far back
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:11:11 Try adding wings to the front
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:12:08 .................
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:12:22 Are you honestly kidding, absolutely everyone?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:12:37 You haven't put any wings down, no engines, no pilot seat, no jack squat
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:12:58 For the love of god, Jamie, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:14:57 .... No offense, but I don't think this is your kind of game
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:15:47 It's, a bit too complex, requires brain usage, but seriously, my advice: Hit every button until you find what to do and don't joke about a single block being a "plane" ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:16:46 Honestly, if this is the "plane" you're complaining can't fly, well, I seriously don't think it's your kind of game https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/529753678018641931/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:17:09 If you want help, you need to figure out at the very least, the bare essentials, like how to actually place stuff down, and how to tweak it
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:17:16 I don't think so, at least not yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:17:41 .... Question, how old are you Jamie?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:18:29 Discord Terms of Service dictates that we need to evict people that we know are under 13, and, no offense, but you're, seeeeriously acting underage
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:18:47 Is it really that hard to click stuff to see what happens?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:19:05 I know Blops, we exist in a weird nebulous little bubble
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:19:23 Jamie, it's because these are things that 5 year olds have gotten
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:19:56 Try <#504436696021204992> or even here squiddy
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:20:10 Jamie, just click all the build buttons on the left first
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:20:32 Lior, no amount of help will help them if they can't figure out how to access all the building materials, which I think is the primary issue here
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:20:41 At least if this is anything to go off of https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/529753678018641931/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:21:10 I said bare essentials previously, not even basics
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:21:35 Alright, you know how to access those, now click through the other buttons
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:21:41 I think the piston and wing will be of interest for you
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:22:07 Then scale up the tutorial plane!
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:22:41 If you can build something that flies, build it larger, that's how I went from this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363205034803204/Capture_62.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:22:46 To this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/525529426478366721/Capture_70.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:23:00 Obsid, that's hard coded
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:24:09 Right, Jamie, if you can build something that flies, in this case you're literally given something that flies, then scale it up
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:30 Waaaaaat?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:39 What's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:22:50 Welp, huh
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:23:09 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:03 NooBaris, they're just going over the plan to make pixel art
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:25:12 I ain't immortalized in pixel art yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:03 Meanwhile I've still gotta figure out my final project
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:20 For Plane Crazy, for now
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:28:47 I'm slamming into a creative block, although I really want to at least roll this last unit out
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:29:36 It's supposed to be the unit to beat all other units, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:30:05 Doesn't have to be larger than the King Dragon, but it does have to be better
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:30:50 Like the iPhone SE, except better eternally essentially
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:31:15 Heh, I'm not exactly a peaceful guy now am I?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 06:33:00 Eheheeehhhhhh, about that Kratos, I'll go to DMs about that
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:18:50 <@163143541160148992> , we need you in the official server, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:20:06 I think I know who it is ... <@!399646745497174017>
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:20:51 I'm pointing fingers at you because you didn't respond at all, it matches your dialect, and you were warned for being a nuance (Gonna double check the last part)
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:22:25 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:24:18 Wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 22:24:30 God damn it, people were working there
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 03:45:11 Because the second wasn't made by him
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:19:14 I'm back from the deaaaaaad, sorta,ish, in a way
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:19:24 
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:19:52 Life's still a generalized crap tornado, but I decided to just suck it up basically
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:20:32 Do you really think after I continuously beat C4RAB on the head (and he understood why I did so), that he'd come on, through a ban, to try to get back at me?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:21:02 Not to mention I have my ranks card, which includes the "ranked" rank, which was after C4RAB left
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:22:02 I'd say, 8/10
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:24:12 I guess it's for functionality in the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:26:12 Meh, one quick question, would I be getting the mod rank back or nah? I'm fine either way
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:26:42 Ehhhh, I suppose I will just incase something hits the fan
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:27:35 Let's see it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:12 I'll handle it
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:33 Ah, welp, alright then
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:28:43 I was going to come on and try to scare him out of there, but meh
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 21:29:44 I just need to fly over him once with this and he wets himself in fear

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:50:49 Remember how I split my fighter literally in half Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:51:30 And I swapped out the landing gear, and suddenly it was stupidly durable against your rope storm
creations-chat 2019-01-06 22:51:47 Use a converter, .wmv files have been getting more and more viruses recently

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:54:24 Within a certain proximity they turn to hit
creations-chat 2019-01-06 22:54:39 Wait, where the heck are the engines on it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:57:03 They're either ridiculously powerful, or ridiculously underpowered (there has been only ONE game that I know that has gotten PVP missiles done in the middleground of balanced)

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:24:51 Yoko, here http://images.landofnod.com/is/image/LandOfNod/Letter_Giant_Enough_F_231843_LL
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:25:44 Actually Imperial, Goliath vs King Dragon, the King Dragon is in theory far more durable, because it's built using only single blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:25:56 Wat, the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:26:07 <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with that if you would please <@!128600291590275072>
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:26:28 Jako, that's what people tend to do, considering the physics simulation isn't insane
creations-chat 2019-01-06 23:28:02 Well, it's a boat
creations-chat 2019-01-06 23:28:22 There's nothing else really to say about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:39:03 Wait, is that a new video?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:39:36 Ah, I already talked to trollgeinuous to add a "do not copy" label somewhere in future videos, like an obvious one
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 23:40:13 Not, quite like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:05:52 No offense rob, but the Kraken and your creation are nowhere NEAR the same thing, not to mention the Kraken actually has alot of little details, while yours is just, blocky
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:35 Like, it's got blocks just TO have blocks to be honest, not for details, design, not even cargo (which is the only forgivable area where having blocks just to have blocks is fair)
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:43 GTA5 Kraken submarine
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:06:59 I think it's one of the newer ones
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:07:51 I think the others talked about it, since I've been back only recently, I'm gonna let them handle it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:11:43 Technically "By any means possible", so it doesn't matter how low effort it is
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:11:47 Just as long as you get it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:11:52 But anything else, yeah no, that's not happening
general 2019-01-07 01:12:17 Just cut to the chase
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:12:51 Trust me, to get many of the ranks without waiting for hours, you need to achieve the speed SOMEHOW
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:13:31 ...... <@456226577798135808> , that's, not, to be honest that's one of the lowest effort builds I've seen
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:13:57 You need 10 digits, and the leftmost one needs to be 6 or greater
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:14:07 So, at least 6000000000 speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:16:22 ..........................

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:25:42 We aren't talking about trojan soldiers ya know
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:25:46 ....

creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:27:13 Rob, I literally blocked like 10 fucking trojans from people trying to send me .wmv files, in a single day
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:27:15 Now cut it out
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:27:43 ..........
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:28:13 Because, I have received attempted viruses from .wmv files, and so fucking help me, if you don't bother reading what I type, then don't bother posting anything
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:29:02 Better, effing, better, for crap's sake
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:29:47 You're only getting supersonic because you don't qualify for anything else
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:42:42 My plane is so fat that it flipped over Battleship's carrier
the-dump 2019-01-07 01:43:52 Depends, but 99% of the time, yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:44:11 ... What the actual fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:45:39 <@!299709301193310209> You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:51:22 Oh hey, I see that request Orange
creations-chat 2019-01-07 01:51:56 You, already have, light speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:56:42 That's actually light speed I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:01:31 <@!434989303882579981> 
You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and blah blah blah, look, you probably already get it shin, you're a nice guy, so I won't just shove a copy and paste message for ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:01:44 Rob, look at this
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:01:49 !infactions <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:02:08 OH WHAT THE F- .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 02:02:10 R key, why?
bug-reports 2019-01-07 02:02:29 He might've been shoved under the map
the-dump 2019-01-07 02:03:20 I think they're expired
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:18:44 Where?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:19:21 Huh
creations-chat 2019-01-07 03:19:58 Did, you even bother reading the ranks?
help 2019-01-07 03:20:31 Finished creations tend to get better reception, although if you want to request an earlier rank, you may
creations-chat 2019-01-07 03:21:50 .......... <@470610344528838677> , did you actually read the ranks? Because if you read the ranks, you'd know which rank is which, and judging from the ranks you asked for, you probably haven't
help 2019-01-07 03:22:16 Did you use ballasts or ice?
help 2019-01-07 03:23:01 Check their weighting
help 2019-01-07 03:23:37 I have no idea then, did you examine the Center of Mass and everything?
help 2019-01-07 03:24:14 Might be the motors then
help 2019-01-07 03:25:50 Hmmmmm, to be honest I have no idea
help 2019-01-07 03:26:09 Try seeing just how severe it is, put something on the right side until it either stops tilting or capsizes to the right
help 2019-01-07 03:31:21 Again, try to see how severe it is, whether it's practically a feather, or if it's a huge amount of weight
help 2019-01-07 03:31:45 If it's a feather amount of weight, you need to make it stabilize it's self, if it's a huge amount, you've screwed something up
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:38:37 Dude, Arch, do you realize how bad of an idea that is to remove the block limit?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:41:50 Simply put we're having problems with lag machines now, with the 1500 limit, imagine a 90K block limit
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:41:54 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:41:57 Arch
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:42:18 How would you like to never be able to play the game again? This isn't the Dwarf Fortress community, this is Roblox
help 2019-01-07 03:42:40 You need to stabilize it then, weight on the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:43:14 How would a 90K magnet creation not crash your **COMPUTER**?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:43:37 You're allowed very minor stabilization, depending on it's size
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:43:45 Blue, starfighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:44:10 I hit 1.4K total and my King Dragon's starting to lag the crap out of everyone
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:44:16 I meant like an actual starfighter, not one of those
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:44:23 They're just fighter jets with stubby wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:44:57 Yes, you can Arch, so long as you keep a very, VERY low energy usage
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:45:25 Not, quite like that, people have made alot of StarWars crafts before, but either way, good luck on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:45:31 There's a reason it's hard to make a convincing starfighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:46:21 Tell them "Then build something better"
help 2019-01-07 03:51:28 All I can say is use motors
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:53:35 Uhhhh, I recognize that character <@!227555337945743360>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:53:41 Change the PFP
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:54:09 Hi Jackal, I'm back from the dead
help 2019-01-07 04:03:24 That's why I don't use motors
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:09:17 Just search up something to shove the .wmv through
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:09:29 If you apply for the rank, you get it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:13:38 Aaaaactually, Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:13:45 Look in <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:14:01 Yeah, it's not edited
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:14:20 Same thing happened to lego in there
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:27:33 Let's see?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:30:22 <@!227555337945743360> , you're clear now
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:30:49 Also, linh, I'll leave it up to Imperial and the others, considering they're better with ships, although I personally say you deserve replicator
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:43:53 Look, if it flies, it's probably able to sail as well ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:44:05 For crap's sake, THIS THING CAN FLOAT
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:44:14 I'm saying that against you
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:44:41 This thing is so heavy that this is the result of Battleship's carrier after I LANDED on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:50:23 ................ <@!227555337945743360> , no twin tower jokes, we already had to boot one person for that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:52:48 I'm not going to argue NSFW on that, what I am going to argue is controversial
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:52:52 Infact, absurdly controversial
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:56:02 Wait, didn't, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:20:03 Rifled, do you want us to stop you, or do you want someone who's able to send a trojan over to stop you? And no, that's not a threat, that's a genuine question
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:20:48 I am aware of that, I'm explaining why we asked you to delete them
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:25:18 Imperial and Empire are the experts on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:25:29 Click on your profile
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:25:56 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:25:59 Oh, that's a problem them
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:06 I never went on mobile Discord, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:30 Because they're assholes that want to be shot, that's why
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:34 I'll just get it for you Renegade
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:26:58 
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:27:45 And hippity hoppity I'm going to burn them down
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:27:52 Now remove the swastikas, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:28:07 ... <@!197787044896833536> , now means __**NOW**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:28:45 We've already whack-a-moled a few idiots for building swastikas to piss off the server, do we have to break your face in as well <@!197787044896833536> ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:28:58 Jekeri, that's Imperial and Empire's specialty, I'll forward it to them
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:29:03 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:03 He's still doing it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:28 Permaban from the server and shout for Rick to ban him from the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:50 Well, by shout I mean tell him, not ping him
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:31:54 I don't think it uses any admin
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:32:10 Madattak's against it for some reason, I'm guessing because he's worried that the admins/mods will go out of control
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:33:03 Didn't we ban you t33?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:33:08 I'm gonna check the logs
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:33:54 Oh, not a permaban
creations-chat 2019-01-07 16:34:18 Please no .wmvs, those can harbor trojan viruses and I've already had to shoot down a few .wmv trojans
creations-chat 2019-01-07 16:34:24 Use some form of converter
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:35:48 I saw the hover/surf board, that's up for the others to decide, skis and wheel we don't care about, literally anyone can do that, and I have to see the stunts and the boat
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:36:45 PFFFHAHAAHH, I spooked Rifled so hard that he's basically locked down everything on his account
creations-chat 2019-01-07 16:39:27 That's pretty nice!
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:47:38 Howso Supernova?

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:49:45 <@!246756032125206529> , he is LYING
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:49:56 Although for the sake of just seeing if he was, I decided to give him one last chance
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:50:07 If he builds one more symbol, he's dead, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:50:22 Also, if he was buddhist, EXPLAIN THIS https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/531867017079422996/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:52:19 Now CUT IT OUT WITH THE SINGLE WORD SPAM
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:52:58 <@!484363661121421332> , it needs to be on a historically accurate model, such as a ME-262's tail

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:53:34 Notice how there's a swastika on the tail of the ME-262? That's allowed
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:53:52 Random swastikas plastered on the floor? That's asking for the guillotine
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:53:56 ........... No
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:57:02 ......................... I'll double check that one
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:57:10 Also, Kublox, why do you ask?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:58:26 Because their friends tried to cause a shitstorm in the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 16:59:34 You're fine being on as long as you don't cause trouble
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:00:43 Look <@!468094971430436867> , I've got proof he isn't innocent, so don't try to argue it like the other guy did

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:11:08 Oh, yeah you need a rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:11:19 <@!280026855782744064> , that's Roblox's side, not us
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:11:32 Also alot more blocks and weapons, that's a bit more, iffy

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:19:31 If they're in the server, they don't really need to get the link to the server now do they?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:19:36 Just say which one you're going to

You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:20:38 Who's your friend?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:21:34 I guess just ping the owners of the ones that don't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:22:07 Well, ask Xpert about it, but I vote yes on that
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:22:25 Uhhhhhh
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:23:08 <@!297519592232976384> , that's a tutorial VTOL given extra bits, sadly nothing for it
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:25:19 There, by PURE extra points alone you got Lag Overseer <@!255361087262818304> , even though for surface creations we're supposed to half it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:25:56 If someone gets banned, their friends are allowed on, but if they attempt to back them up without evidence that they were right, they get kicked, then banned
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:27:09 I mean, looks like a pretty big transformation, and the attention to detail to
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:28:01 I'll let the others check, but considering the size <@!297519592232976384> , tutorial vehicle?

creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:38:13 I'd say no, but at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if you got master designer with one of those
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:39:24 .................
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:39:57 Right, guys, next one to continue this outside of <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> gets a very temporary mute, starting at 10 minutes, with each continuation adding 10 more minutes, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:40:36 Supernova, what are you even talking about?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:40:47 This is my fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:40:58 And this is it after being hit by about 40 missiles (no joke)
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:41:09 And it could still fight quite well infact
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:41:47 ......... Supernova, ever heard of lag?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:42:30 Uhhhh, <@!468094971430436867> , is that yours?

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:43:38 ............... Wait you're someone I blocked, oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:44:07 I blocked a select few people in the past, Sid's one of them, usually the biggest troublemakers in the group
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:44:59 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:45:39 Oh what the f-

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:47:23 It's getting irritating and off topic at this point, plus we don't have that rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:48:11 Supernova, check how long they are
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:48:30 I made a promise that next few people to go off topic without going to the proper servers gets increasing levels of mutes
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:48:47 Like, place down blocks and see how tall/wide/long they are, so you'll know if you're dealing with a 3X3 or a 2X2 engine
help 2019-01-07 17:49:25 Use the folding technique with motors, one at the top, one at the bottom to balance out the actions
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:49:40 No duh it won't go in the middle!
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:49:56 You can't move blocks in increments of .5
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 17:51:09 .... Supernova, we aren't going to babysit your every need, some things you just need to learn how to deal with
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:51:19 What's the payload?
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:51:42 That's not exactly bombardier, traditionally we'd use blocks
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:52:10 Bomberdier example
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:52:39 Those are all max weight ballasts in the bombs by the way
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:53:14 Well, it can be anything to be honest
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:53:25 Just drop something on someone
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:53:55 Must be 500 speed or greater, sorry
creations-chat 2019-01-07 17:54:27 Quite literally anything can count as bombs, although, try to be creative

help 2019-01-07 18:11:46 I think it's the max strength of the motor
help 2019-01-07 18:46:13 You placed two going in the same direction, so as one's providing force one way, the other's providing force the other way, and for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 18:49:04 Depends on various things
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 18:49:24 Mouse control, control surface position, assisting engines, etc
help 2019-01-07 18:50:06 Again, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, so keep that in mind
help 2019-01-07 18:50:13 You're generating torque while you're rotating that propeller
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:17:10 ... <@!345689630131093505> , rule 2, NSFW

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:27:05 Now that's impressive, although, uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:27:26 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:28:10 As per Orangeskii and Awesomepotatoe's word, you're unmuted, but try it again and see what happens, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:29:55 ..... <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you would, and change the PFP, it's potentially breaking rule 2, I'm gonna lean on the side of "it's not", but it's really just disturbing
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:30:26 Welp, that's impressive
creations-chat 2019-01-07 20:47:32 I think it's been done before, but I'll check
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 20:48:35 Ornithopters are really hard, hence why there's very few of them, but they have been made before
creations-chat 2019-01-07 20:48:46 Sorry, but nada on the inventor
creations-chat 2019-01-07 20:50:20 It's been made before
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:11:22 Mind if I slam an upvote alongside a checkmark with it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:16:43 I believe so

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:33:05 Do you want me to demonstrate? I'll make a note that it's a demonstration infraction
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:33:36 TLDR those are past punishments
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:33:42 Do you want me to demonstrate?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:33:53 How the infractions system works

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:35:16 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:35:22 **BEFORE WE CONTINUE** please, tell me your age
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:35:51 I'm mandated by Discord to request for people's age

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:37:54 And you are **ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN** of this, because once you say yes, it is out of our hands and into yours, and any legal trouble goes to you afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:38:23 Very well then, if you're underage, any and all legal trouble will be directed to you
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:38:58 Like, you can get in trouble with the law for this stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:43:32 ........... <@!242001785026248704> , we tend to ignore people that act responsibly, even if we find out they're underage, and we tend to (metaphorically) hang people who are in the proper age, but act like assholes
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:43:44 Then we have to ban you for a year, although again, if you act responsibly, we might ignore it
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:44:04 Until you're 13, then you can come back on
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:44:17 If we find out you're underage though, it's a **PERMABAN**, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:44:55 .........................................

plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:49:51 <@!299709301193310209> , all ranks applicable have been given
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:51:06 Probably were missing a couple of digits
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 21:51:33 Also, you ain't cool until you've made a 1.4K creation fly without any helium or ballasts whatsoever

creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:11:31 It's, not quite a rocket, more like a space shuttle actually
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:11:35 Hence why I didn't count it
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:12:39 In <#491710474786832394> , go "&suggest (Insert your suggestion here)"
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:12:56 Again, I'll give you the copy/paste message I send to those I rank
"You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas"
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:13:34 Show me?
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:14:38 Done
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:15:39 Pfff, any rank requests for it?
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:16:18 Alright, also yes plasmic?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:20:04 What do you mean spooky? Like forwards, or just fast?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:22:45 Use propeller blades and rotate them so they act like a spoiler
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:23:00 Or just pretend via using max weight ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:23:46 They're stupid large because they're meant for larger creations
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:24:01 If you're manually building wheels with cylinders, then dang, bonus points
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:24:58 Weeeeeelp, <#473249376223887371> doesn't say anything else, so, I GUESS you get it, somehow
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:25:48 Meanwhile I'm just happily making ~~oversized~~ superfighters
creations-chat 2019-01-07 22:27:24 A what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:28:52 Hold on Quaser, I'll bring up the pin as to why this is an issue
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:29:20 Well, huh ._.
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:29:27 But anyways, resizing would be an issue because it's really hard to do
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:30:03 Too Long Don't Read
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 22:33:23 Just got Red Baron thanks to Battleship
creations-chat 2019-01-07 23:09:17 Because I was taking pictures of a formation
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:17:51 Now THIS, looks awesome, credit to battleship and firecop222
creations-chat 2019-01-07 23:19:23 Now this, looks awesome (Credit to battleship5781 on the right and firecop222 on the left in the picture)
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:28:41 Inviting a specific member on
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:34:26 By the way <@!525489860912480266> , I ranked you based on the creations I saw while I was in the server, which means you've got voting abilities
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:35:12 <@!362351190618538005> , At the very least bug me about it, I've spooked multiple people by acting like I have power
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:43:00 Hey, you perfectly balanced helium
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:51:18 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:51:29 Photo op?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:51:37 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:51:58 Oh I am pretty bad with combining stuff, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:52:18 I mean, most I could do is really just make a launchable fighter like the Wyvern
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:52:34 Plus my inspiration's sorta run out, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 23:52:41 Sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 00:03:45 ............. I meaaaaaaaaaaan
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 00:04:43 Yeah okay, he gets the historical accuracy pass if he adds a red band to the middle of it, Germans did use zeppelins for various things I believe
creations-chat 2019-01-08 01:37:02 Isn't that from one of the Wolfenstein games?
creations-chat 2019-01-08 01:37:17 Nice
creations-chat 2019-01-08 01:37:36 You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 01:56:07 I mean, the number 1 problem everyone has with their helis that I can see is that they need to counter the rotation on their rotor blades, so I always go "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction", and 90% of people seem to get it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:08:17 I mean, just give them to him, so long as he can prove he's able to carry a payload in that thing, he can probably hit a target if it's large enough
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:08:28 Or if he's persistent enough
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:18:50 Sorry to break it but whaaaaat is even happening?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:22:38 Flexing on every other solid state (no motor) fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:23:37 Trust me, nothing can save him from blowing up in a burning fire
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:23:50 If anything's gonna get close, it's that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:23:54 I'm not in a server currently
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:23:59 Also, is Totten gone?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:24:52 Mmmmm, I remember he threw a crapstorm or something in the past, although I think I clonked his head hard enough that he suddenly changed
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:25:32 imagine running out of horizontal plot size
this message was sent by fighter builder gang
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:25:39 Did I nail it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:32:38 __***AHEM <@!128600291590275072> , WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT NSFW CRUD!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:33:09 ......................................................
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:33:37 Once Imperial starts typing I can't stop him
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:36:15 He didn't seem malicious (no that's not a pun), although he did seem a bit too mischievous for his own good, I would've honestly done just 2 days
creations-chat 2019-01-08 02:39:29 This is Roblox, not real life, so go crazy
creations-chat 2019-01-08 02:40:06 I mean, this thing can turn within the area of the plot, imagine how many Gs that is continuously
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 02:40:30 Under the "delta wings" section I'd assume, or next update
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 13:30:06 ............. Can you not in the server?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 13:31:21 Just say "MagicalRamenXI is doing (insert reason here)"
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 13:31:42 Don't just post it publicly, that causes issues
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 13:34:10 I'm a mod, but I'm trying to find the person, are they in a PVP server?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 15:10:31 Pretty freaking big
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 15:34:40 Tell him "Hi from James"
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 16:42:29 A giant present has been done before, infact, someone freaking weaponized one hilariously enough
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:56:00 ............. <@!530719228794503168> , can you not just join to be a generic asshole? Seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:56:06 ............
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:56:37 <@456226577798135808> Can you get over here?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:56:39 .........
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:57:04 Permaban this damn fool, he's being an asshole
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:57:18 <@!530719228794503168> , just scroll up, see what he typed
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:58:17 The heck? That was a glitch and a half Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:58:22 Oh, I found a few people
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:58:37 But, ehhh, I think I may've spooked them off actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:58:40 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:59:11 Blacklist him then unblacklist him
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:59:24 If he continues it, he'll hit your blacklist box and get ruined, but more likely than not he'll be reset
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 17:59:46 Then tell the person next to you via "/w (person)" to do so, it'll either reset his creation repeatedly, or it'll bump into it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:07:57 ............ <@456226577798135808> , why? Like, why exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:08:33 I mean, if it's a joke ban then sure, I've logged down your ranks anyways, otherwise you do realize they're pretty permanent, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:09:03 
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:09:23 I've got rank cards of people that may potentially come back
help 2019-01-08 18:10:04 Didn't I tell you how to fix it? Tell the others near him to blacklist him and it'll either break his creation or reset him
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:12:32 Don't worry, I logged down their ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:13:10 That's why I left a notification via DMs that he was making an abnormal request
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:13:44 OH YEAH! <@!484363661121421332> , I BELIEVE the crew have agreed upon it, although we'd prefer the iron cross rather than the swastika if you're going for historical accuracy
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:14:43 Just don't go overboard on it, and if we see you randomly posting it everywhere, well you've seen the mountain of corpses of the wrongdoers upon which we have smited
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:15:36 Like, extra lift, but extra drag as well?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:15:44 There's ALOT more <@!484363661121421332> , sooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:16:16 The extra drag is, ABSURDLY bad for me to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:16:39 I mean look at this! Look at just how much of this is pure wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:16:59 If I get more drag I can't take off any of my creations
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:17:42 A toggle maybe? So those that don't need it (like me), can keep it off, but those that need it can turn it on?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:18:03 Jeke, we already have them
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:18:21 Just combine 3 1X1s then
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:19:38 ..... <@362606612726153218>
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:20:27 If that means what I think it means, so help me
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:22:16 <@!266571579159347204> __**AHEM**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:22:39 Better
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 18:32:17 I've got a ton of internals on my crafts, so unless I crack open the shell, you don't have a chance in hell of copying it
bug-reports 2019-01-08 18:39:54 What do you mean by other loadout?
bug-reports 2019-01-08 18:40:56 I have, no idea, huh
creations-chat 2019-01-08 18:55:54 ... <@456226577798135808> , here, have the Wyrm, the engines are outdated and it tends to nosedive to the ground, but it's a good place to model your craft against https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363205034803204/Capture_62.PNG
creations-chat 2019-01-08 18:56:11 You can model your craft off of that if you want one that works (or used to work)
creations-chat 2019-01-08 18:56:53 I'm open sourcing that craft by the way, it's so outdated that if anyone can make it work, feel free to iterate upon it
creations-chat 2019-01-08 18:58:39 I heard "Starship" and I got excited, but then I saw it was a real thing, god damn it! Why does nobody build original crafts? Just alot of real life ones
creations-chat 2019-01-08 18:58:54 Which one <@456226577798135808> ? There's like 90 of them
creations-chat 2019-01-08 19:00:04 I will say, **FUCK** I miss seeing this fighter https://i.redd.it/kswerhc425s01.jpg
creations-chat 2019-01-08 19:00:33 It's the Ratchet and Clank one, well, ONE OF the Ratchet and Clank ones, the last one you got in the first game
creations-chat 2019-01-08 19:01:48 Only sad thing is you never got to see that thing shooting anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:06:11 It's been suggested, it's not being added
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:06:55 Probably if you detonate them all at once, because that can seriously lag people out
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:08:45 Ask rick or some of the others, I don't use explosives (Don't PING rick though)
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:17:43 ........
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:17:47 You need to be ranked
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:21:39 Guys ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:22:03 Now calm your faces
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:22:29 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:22:44 It's WASD
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:23:22 <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:24:17 Every other key for everything else works, even re-assigning previously broken keys work, but assigning keys to WASD seems to break, at least from what I can see
bug-reports 2019-01-08 19:26:14 Whatever's causing it is linked with WASD, control surfaces, motors, engines, etc, they all work on any other key, but when assigned to WASD, they lock up and don't react
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:33:08 Guys, just calm down, all we can do is wait patiently now and try to spread the news that it's being fixed
bug-reports 2019-01-08 19:33:29 Rick is aware of this and is currently fixing it
bug-reports 2019-01-08 19:33:51 Just please wait patiently until the fix comes out, and spread the news of the fix coming out soon to the others within your server, if it's a public server
bug-reports 2019-01-08 19:34:12 Likely after the fix/update, creations will start working again, so no need to change keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:34:50 Just please, wait, and plan out what you want to do
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:35:27 <@!323479282980487169> , Rick is fixing it, please be patient
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:36:30 I'm very sure Rick would tell us later
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:37:56 <@!421049901896433665> , then save it!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:38:56 No idea, but it hit every server at the same time it seems
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:39:03 I'm gonna try calming people down
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:39:44 Tiny Roblox update?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:40:42 WASD keybinds broke for everything except walking, although Rick's fixed it at this point I believe
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:42:40 ... <@456226577798135808> , NOT NOW!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:42:57 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:44:13 <@456226577798135808> , can you come over here? One more bagged to be cleaned up
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:45:07 <@402123421011673099> , We're having a problem, WASD inputs got nuked
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:45:20 <@!351301652398997504> , WASD is broken, but other keybinds work just fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:45:37 What's the solution then do pray tell?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:45:46 Rick, EVERYTHING broke
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:46:04 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:46:16 I'm gonna try that Rauf
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:47:18 It seemed to only happen today
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:47:33 ... <@398831625544269835> , Does it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:48:03 ... <@398831625544269835> , Liar, my Wyvern, which relies on WASD controls, doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:48:06 Or you're in a new server
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:48:54 Nada, crap
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:49:26 Kratos, the problem is EVERYONE will have to do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:49:39 <@398831625544269835> DON'T CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS FOR US!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:50:07 Rick, estimate a fix time?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:50:31 .........
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:50:40 Don't make me
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:51:06 That, we're dealing with a bit of a crisis here, we don't need more chaos
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:51:20 <@!432565853142384670> , WASD are broken, use alternate keybinds until it's fixed, or wait for the fix
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:51:45 <@398831625544269835> , it's not mod abusing if you're causing problems
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:54:07 <@!421049901896433665> , it was Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:55:05 Just, **LOOK**
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:55:32 Don't question it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 19:55:56 Point is it's not Rick's problem, Roblox broke something
bug-reports 2019-01-08 19:59:53 We're aware of it!
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:00:12 Rick's fixing it now, just please tell him and anyone else you see that Roblox made a minor update that broke WASD
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:00:22 Every other keybind will work just fine though
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:00:45 Battleship, cut it out, seriously, not the time
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:01:01 WASD is broken, Rick's fixing it though
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:01:14 Roblox made an update that broke WASD
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:01:30 <@!401061364442857472> , scroll up, Rick's aware of the bug, WASD is broken, but all other keybinds will work
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:01:49 Please be patient and wait for a fix, if you want to continue flying, please rebind the keys temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:02:07 It's broken in ALL servers so far That
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:02:22 W, A, S and D are all broken, use T, Y, H, G, etc
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:02:33 __**CAT, WHATEVER, YOU GET THE POINT**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:03:16 <@!351301652398997504> , don't be freaking rude, he's trying his best to fix it and explain it!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:03:51 It doesn't help that people keep on bugging him, even though he's trying his best to fix it!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:04:10 Cat, every keybind associated with WASD is broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:04:17 That includes engines, motors, control surfaces, etc
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:04:28 Cat, you can temporarily rebind your controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:04:35 <@!351301652398997504> , <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with that if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:05:20 Battleship, are you able to rebind keys?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:05:51 WASD are the only keys that are broken (And esc/spacebar, but who uses those two for controls in a plane?)
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:06:04 Shin, Rick's fixing it, please be patient
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:06:33 Hidear, I meant escape/spacebar being used for controlling a plane!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:07:09 Wait, <@398831625544269835> , F9 log, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:07:15 Hidear, that's called jumping
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:08:10 <@430121953656045569> , Rick's working on an update to fix it now, so please wait until that update
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:08:19 You can rebind keys still, just don't use WASD for now
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:13:52 You already have it Aero!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:14:21 It's not fixed yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:14:49 WASD is broken, you can rebind it however
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:15:49 <@234370409590423553> , if it's about WASD not working, we know, Rick's fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:16:22 Just please be patient, tell others in your server to be patient, and so on, Roblox made a minor update sometime around 2:00PM EST that broke W, A, S and D as keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:17:17 In the mean time, relax and say "hi" to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:20:09 Seriously though Cat, please just go to <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:20:24 Which renegade?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:20:34 It's 1 hour, so he should be allowed back on
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:20:41 If not, I'll fix it
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:21:32 He wanted a joke ban for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:21:40 So, I gave him a 1 hour joke ban
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:24:20 <@456226577798135808> , gonna work on your ranks, give me a moment
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:25:01 Ranks have been given
general 2019-01-08 20:27:09 Isn't there a help menu somewhere in the main menu?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:28:33 Renegade, just make something that deserves a rank, and most mods, when they're on, will rank you
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:28:48 Example: This will get me master builder if a mod picks it up
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:29:01 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:29:13 Feel free to DM me by the way if you want to expedite the process, EVENTUALLY I'll come back on
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:29:35 Yes I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:29:59 I decided to just suck it up to be honest
general 2019-01-08 20:30:33 You must've stalled out
general 2019-01-08 20:30:46 Keep throttle well above the red line and you should be fine 90% of the time
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:30:55 Show proof Leo?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:31:02 Wait you already have something better!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:31:09 The lag ranks are better than any builder ranks
general 2019-01-08 20:31:22 Which one? MFS?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:31:29 You have it Renegade
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:32:14 Since this is an emergency time Rick, I'll be available on the hotline, give me a shout via DMs and I'll drop everything to help
help 2019-01-08 20:33:27 Take whatever comes to your mind and build upon it until you've got something you like
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:33:50 WASD is broken due to a Roblox update sometime around 2:00 PM EST
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:34:04 <@!280370489619251202> ^
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:34:41 "-Roblox ~~murder~~ update, server crashes-"
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:35:39 No idea, but please just spread the news if there are any other people in the server that next update will fix the WASD problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:35:43 For now any other keybind will work
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:36:41 You'd think they'd have some BASIC quality assurance to make sure nothing breaks
help 2019-01-08 20:37:00 There you go, build a ring shaped fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:37:33 ### ## ### #### ### ### #### ###### ###########

help 2019-01-08 20:37:48 Just start running at it, you'll be stunned at what you can get
help 2019-01-08 20:38:09 It's how I went from this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518891282177851402/519363205034803204/Capture_62.PNG
help 2019-01-08 20:38:13 To this
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:38:24 It still does for me
help 2019-01-08 20:38:38 NO COPYING BY THE WAY
help 2019-01-08 20:38:48 I mean, go for it
general 2019-01-08 20:39:25 I honestly hate what MFS has become, namely with the missiles being too damn effective, or not effective at all
general 2019-01-08 20:39:39 And limited quantity of missiles
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:39:55 They censored alot of numbers, alot of single phrases, etc
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:40:07 I literally had to go to fucking roman numerals at one point!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:40:17 Like, literally, I had to do "VIII" just to say 8
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:40:41 Okay, we don't care what's on your mind <@!280370489619251202> , just don't chare it with us, okay?
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:41:16 Helpful data for Rick to fix, that's what
general 2019-01-08 20:41:33 By limited quantity, I mean mid-flight
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:41:53 That'd be asking for pain
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:43:00 Trust me Empire, I can't have a conversation on Roblox because of the damn system
the-dump 2019-01-08 20:43:36 "You've got a hole in your right wing"
"You've got a hole in the nose"
"You've got a hole in your tail"
"You've got a hole in your cockpit"
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:53:04 I'm in
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 20:53:14 WASD works in there
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:00:03 Wings seem to have negative drag
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:00:13 Which results in fonkl's crazy spiral
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:01:35 Better one
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:02:33 <@!265484911912288257> , We're dealing with it, next update's got it fixed already
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:23:51 The next update will fix it, we're currently playtesting it now
creations-chat 2019-01-08 21:27:02 That's a tutorial creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:27:19 Guns hitting your own explosive blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:28:41 Check <#490306593242611742> now
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:28:59 Pick a shape and start building on it Blaine
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:31:15 I don't think that's inventor-worthy, but it is pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:32:20 Check <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:32:34 Haugh, for a majority of people it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:35:56 Anything you need to test Rick?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:36:09 Wait, what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:36:19 Oh, in the test server, OF COURSE it works, it's got the fix
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:36:34 I'm checking the main game now
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:37:08 Whup, I think it's working again
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:38:38 Controls are working again!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:39:18 <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:40:22 Eheehhh, sorry, I got a bit carried away trying to be the PR guy
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:40:41 <@305543798241624064> , Red Barron has to be with other players, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 21:40:51 Like help desk, Public Relations, something along the lines of that
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:41:01 Half blocks do that I believe
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:42:00 Update's out
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:42:06 Let the VIP server refresh
bug-reports 2019-01-08 21:43:07 No idea, can't win em all though sadly
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:06:39 The new update rolled out, so it should be fixed
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:30:05 Nothing that affects gameplay in any way aside from little "thank you" objects
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:30:13 At least, from what I can guess
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:51:21 ............... Right, let me get this out of the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:51:30 Tip jars, are basically, tiny hood ornaments, that you put on your thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:52:03 Quite literally nothing else, they don't attach on any other side, they don't block damage, and they don't blend well with anything at all
creations-chat 2019-01-08 23:47:09 Hey <@!141594962918637568> , I'd estimate it's about 500 parts, so,
You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
help 2019-01-09 01:31:22 <#507673335816126509> is where validated suggestions go, you need a rank befeore suggesting
help 2019-01-09 01:48:57 We had to do this because people kept on suggesting very, very, **VERY** low quality suggestions
help 2019-01-09 01:52:06 5 people in a row suggested whitelisting, not even bothering to check the person right before them, even though above the first person, they had a star from Rick, which means "Yes, I will do this for sure"
help 2019-01-09 02:03:55 Is it really that hard to examine the settings?
help 2019-01-09 02:04:12 ........ <@!484363661121421332> 
1: This is <#478584971670454284> , not <#491710474786832394> 
2: It has been suggested before, and denied
help 2019-01-09 02:04:23 Reason: Extreme lag
help 2019-01-09 02:04:32 Well, I THINK it's extreme lag
help 2019-01-09 02:04:39 Oh, ops
help 2019-01-09 02:04:45 You're ranked again, hold on
help 2019-01-09 02:05:02 Here, have a canned message
You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
help 2019-01-09 02:05:40 Just follow that guideline or else you're gonna get suggestions banned, got it?
bug-reports 2019-01-09 02:34:24 Go to <#478584971670454284> for this instead, and you need wing pannels
help 2019-01-09 02:37:03 You need wing panels, they're the only ones aerodynamically modeled
help 2019-01-09 02:37:28 Control panels work to, but this isn't just "slap on a ton of stuff and hope it works", it's Plane Crazy, you need some form of actual design
help 2019-01-09 02:37:41 They do, but the thing is, you might not have enough
help 2019-01-09 02:37:50 Or your engines might be too high and it's pushing your nose down
help 2019-01-09 02:39:13 Red
help 2019-01-09 02:40:04 I'm trying to take a break from the server, at least a very minor one
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:48:22 ......... I'm facepalming at this hard enough that I'm coming off of my break
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:48:32 <@456226577798135808> , WRONG WING TYPE
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:49:06 You're using flat wing panels, which are dead, and provide absolutely no propulsion Seagoer, use propeller blades!
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:49:26 Also, <@!292459675830583296> , we had people sharing links to banned members, so only ranked people can access it, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:49:38 <@!216371990959882241> , go for it, as long as it's off topic and follows the rules
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:50:00 Anything above basic
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:50:50 Looks really nice Kratos
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 02:59:06 You need to be ranked
creations-chat 2019-01-09 03:26:22 You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:44:18 Knock knock, I'm here, read the damn rules ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:44:50 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:45:10 That's rule 5 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:45:43 ......... We can't edit people's chat
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:45:51 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:46:00 Totten, do I need to beat you silly again like last time?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:46:26 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:47:12 Now cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:48:00 Can verify, Imperial's correct
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 03:52:41 I mean, it does look cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:45:00 Rick said we could ping him for banning people, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:45:28 I am aware, but the guy's followable
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:45:55 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:45:59 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:48:43 <@!217336009455566848> , we have someone toxic we need to get quarantined out of the game right now
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 04:48:47 
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:19:33 I just realized, we can make a football game with our creations
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:20:15 Like, we have a ball, we have the means of building vehicles, we could make a little football game (I don't mean American football by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:25:03 Soccer/football event suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:34:32 What, the, I've GOTTA see this
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:34:58 Which server!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 05:35:10 I'm in!
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:03:43 .............. Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:03:53 <@403180643233693696> , what's your problem with me exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:05:51 I could count that as two, "**b1tch**", but I don't
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:06:08 ..... Alright then
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:07:34 To be honest I think it's basically black and white here, either people like me, or they hate me, there's no in-between
help 2019-01-09 18:52:34 You've probably got it assigned to the same key, use the purple screwdriver to readjust your controls
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:53:38 The tip jar is a tiny donation, it only connects on one side, and doesn't provide any benefits aside from just looking pretty
creations-chat 2019-01-09 18:54:12 <@!360770826884087818> , add weight to the bottom and helium to the top, that'll keep it balanced
creations-chat 2019-01-09 18:54:35 <@251161780972290048> , just post your creation, it'll automatically be submitted to <#384025409945337856> , JUST DON'T POST .WMVS, there's a virus risk with those
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:55:38 Yeaaahhhhh, once the tipjar gamepass comes out, sadly it won't be free
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:56:16 I believe you can donate, delete the gamepass, and donate again as many times as you want
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:56:38 <@!351809528209080324> , there's a tiny tipjar object that's being circulated around as a sort of way to at least scrape SOME money off of Plane Crazy without it being pay to win
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:56:54 It's like a tiny flag for you to put on your creation basically, as it has no use otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:57:18 Probably miniscule to zero weight
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:57:32 If I had to guess, both rotors are rotating the same way, and the center of lift is too far back
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:58:37 Oh, one of your propeller blades might be the wrong way then
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:58:44 Nope, nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 18:58:59 Center of lift being too far back probably, either that or it's too light
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:00:11 Utilize ballasts, they have adjustable weight, or helium, which has negative weight
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:00:34 Didn't realize you could adjust the weight?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:01:08 I have no idea sub, you could do a flotation or helium experiment with that
creations-chat 2019-01-09 19:02:09 Cool, Hey Ethics, if I had to guess that creation's about 250ish parts, right? (Assuming low usage of beams)
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:02:30 Ignore the center of mass, it can't register helium properly
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:02:35 Like, just place it down outside and see what happens
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:13:09 You need more strength <@!351809528209080324>
help 2019-01-09 19:33:15 Let's see it?
help 2019-01-09 19:33:46 Both if you'd please
creations-chat 2019-01-09 19:35:26 Heh, nice detail with the helium blocks representing smoke
help 2019-01-09 19:37:57 Oh, cowboy beboop ship, thing
help 2019-01-09 19:38:07 You might need to upscale it, by alot
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:38:21 Treadmills, they were added in a recent update
help 2019-01-09 19:39:29 Probably, inset your current cockpit into a ring-like build, leaving the top open, or completely encase it with that ring build, and add a bit more to the top
help 2019-01-09 19:39:43 The rest SHOULD flow from there, use ALOT of wedges by the way
help 2019-01-09 19:40:21 You need a rank <@!381490125416431616> , people kept on sending VIP server links to banned people
help 2019-01-09 19:40:45 Speaking of which, you should be able to see it
help 2019-01-09 19:40:49 Any rank above beginner
help 2019-01-09 19:41:16 No problem
help 2019-01-09 19:41:25 Also, <@!419157971189366804> , you didn't actually get the "ranked" rank, sorry
help 2019-01-09 19:41:37 Just please don't share it with others, we've had issues of banned people accessing them
help 2019-01-09 19:41:45 Even if they're in the server
help 2019-01-09 19:41:58 Nah, you didn't have it, so I gave you it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:42:14 Just for fun I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:42:28 I mean, to be honest, many of these objects you could ask "whats the point?", just for fun
help 2019-01-09 19:42:37 Mushy, you need a rank
help 2019-01-09 19:43:20 **ENTIRELY** new, yes
help 2019-01-09 19:43:33 Be warned: Most are taken already, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:43:55 I think skis are really low friction, that's why
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:44:04 Try it with wheels and see what happens
help 2019-01-09 19:44:20 You can DM your idea to me if you wish, I'll keep it safe
help 2019-01-09 19:44:49 People usually hang out at either the lowest available VIP server on the list, or on the official VIP server, look in the pins or for the one that says "official VIP server"
help 2019-01-09 19:44:57 I'd suggest official VIP
help 2019-01-09 19:46:41 Like if I do "!warn"?
help 2019-01-09 19:47:38 They're supposed to clock out after a month, but I think we do make exceptions for minor ones (or at the very least I do)
help 2019-01-09 19:47:46 ._.

help 2019-01-09 19:48:37 I'm, going, to ignore that, for now, considering you seem to be at least partially nice

creations-chat 2019-01-09 20:41:19 OH! Nevermind, sorry
creations-chat 2019-01-09 20:42:52 <#473249376223887371>
creations-chat 2019-01-09 20:44:04 You're ranked, always check the pins of <#507673335816126509> and <#491710474786832394> , check if your idea is already suggested and make sure to suggest good ideas
creations-chat 2019-01-09 20:47:26 You got it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:57:01 Being banned, that's how, are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:57:09 ...............
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:57:26 What's the announcement?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:58:46 ..... That's, not really pinging everyone worthy unless you're a major member, such as if Xpert did it
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:58:55 Although, good luck with that
creations-chat 2019-01-09 21:29:01 That much is ultimately up to you to do
creations-chat 2019-01-09 21:29:05 Everyone has their own visual style
help 2019-01-10 00:44:43 That's a blacklist box
help 2019-01-10 00:45:03 Basically it's a box whose sole purpose is to prevent you, and any other blacklisted person, from entering
help 2019-01-10 00:46:54 Yeup
help 2019-01-10 00:47:06 Probably don't want you messing with their creation
help 2019-01-10 00:47:46 Ask that guy if he's allowed the person to copy
help 2019-01-10 00:47:52 If the answer is yes, no problem
help 2019-01-10 00:48:00 If the answer is no, tell him to use the anti-copy measure in settings
help 2019-01-10 00:51:36 Settings
help 2019-01-10 00:51:53 In theory you can make a solid opaque box around your area
help 2019-01-10 00:53:33 Still somehow copying?
help 2019-01-10 00:53:44 I think there's an anti-copy box setting
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:15:25 Something something huge hovering spaceships something something
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:15:47 Lots of wing panels, and balance out helium on the internals
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:16:15 Alright, unless it's a joke, don't comment about someone being furry/weeb/whatever unless they're obnoxious about it, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:16:48 Again, you first need to achieve zero weight, so balance out helium
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:17:02 DOH! ROB WASN'T RANKED!
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:17:14 RIP, he needs the ranked role
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:17:55 Honestly can't believe Blackbird wasn't ranked, the heck?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:18:08 Like, with the "ranked" rank
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:18:31 Just follow what the others do
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:18:42 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:18:51 I think Dyno might be dead
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:19:01 Oh FFS
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:19:24 Just tell me what color you want
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 18:19:41 Done
creations-chat 2019-01-10 18:41:09 Looks like SOME plane is happy
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:22:09 <@456226577798135808> , **AHEM**
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:23:20 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:23:39 
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:23:43 Now then

plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:24:09 Ban for NSFW stuff

plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:24:53 ! warn <@!227555337945743360> (This is a joke, notice the space?)
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:25:01 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:26:21 It's ! not ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:26:51 Mee6, at least this one, uses !
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:27:01 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:27:14 He's still here ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:27:45 Done
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:30:11 I, really, really, __**REALLY**__ don't get why people keep on being assholes and doing NSFW shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:30:19 ... Does anyone read <#512414682552729601> anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:42:59 .............
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:43:31 I've had enough of that to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:44:31 It should be fucking common sense anyways <@!351809528209080324> , because this is a Roblox server
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:45:48 Yeah well we're trying to filter out the cancer
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:46:04 If you've got a problem, please, let me show you the way to the trash can outside the door
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:46:07 ........
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:47:16 <@!351809528209080324> , First of all, COMPLETE SENTENCES IF YOU'D PLEASE, not single word spam!
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:47:33 Second of all, you have a right to talk back if they're abusing power, but that's the only situation, and even then other mods usually chime in at that point
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:47:50 If they're talking to you about something serious, like not reading the rules, treat them seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:49:03 Ask him what he's talking about
general 2019-01-10 19:50:32 That moment where Roblox claims Filtering Enabled helps stop hackers
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:50:43 ............................
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:50:59 Do I need to bash your head in (metaphorically) about the fucking rules?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:51:46 You know what? I'm gonna mute you until you fucking read the rules, and you'd BETTER BE ABLE TO DM ME THE RULES BY HEART, GOT IT!?
general 2019-01-10 19:51:59 Tiny Tanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 19:53:02 It just pisses me off when someone can't be bothered to do something they're told, even when it's literally given to them on a silver platter, in their face
creations-chat 2019-01-10 19:57:19 A-10, overdone, but it looks nice
creations-chat 2019-01-10 19:58:15 I'd say ~300, 350 parts?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:21:41 
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:21:50 Still alive as far as I can tell, might be a you problem?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 20:23:49 He's still there
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:06:01 <@!323479282980487169> , Explain this 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510815928754372608/533028340286881792/image0.png
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:06:31 <@!323479282980487169> , Explain it, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:13:58 .... <@!323479282980487169> , that's what literally every single rulebreaker says
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:14:43 ! warn <@!323479282980487169> "A joke" (I left the space there for a reason)
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:14:58 "A joke" is not an excuse anymore, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:15:18 Hey, I've gotta have SOME degree of seriousness incase it gets looked back upon, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:18:38 ......................... Guys
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:37:15 Left sticks out more
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:37:27 It sorta blends together otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:38:17 Right blends together, and it's somewhat forgettable
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:38:40 Actually, space out the stripes on left maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:54:18 <@!435946988559925248> , it's very, very boring
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:54:46 I mean, compare this to all of our crafts just being grey
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:55:14 One of the ranks
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 21:59:08 That, looks like a freaking sore thumb
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 22:40:26 Your clientside shots hit, but serverside shots didn't
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 22:40:37 So while clientside he should be crippled, serverside says he isn't damaged at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 01:12:23 What fighter is that?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 01:17:44 Daaaaamn that looks nice!
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:29:03 Heh, I remmeber that!
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:29:18 
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:29:36 It's the Wyrm, MK1
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:29:47 MK2 had the front canards, or whatever they're called
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:30:06 The MK1 was actually surprisingly in with it's time
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:30:12 The MK2 was cutting edge
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:32:22 I can't remember if it was public or VIP server, all I remember is that it was crazy fun
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:32:46 Back when I tried to make a cockpit, when the motors were glitched
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:33:38 Those were our old builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:33:51 Now we've moved onto stuff like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:38:54 Anyone remember my tiny turbo tank? Back before I redesigned the turret with vanilla friendly mods?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:39:16 That sucker was FAST to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 03:39:25 And it's stable beyond all hell
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:54:22 Actually, I'm gonna test it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:54:30 Well, test something
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:54:53 What I'm gonna test is to see if minimal sized explosive blocks can be used
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:55:53 Ah, they do work actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:58:01 Observe the literally zero damage even though that's a ton of explosive blocks on my back
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 20:58:20 Alright fine I'm gonna do another test then
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:05:52 So turns out 0 radius explosive blocks work just as well as disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:06:25 Observe with the bombs LITERALLY ON MY COCKPIT
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:07:04 You set the explosive radius to 0
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:07:45 That's technically the MK1, just with an opening cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:09:36 To be 100% honest I wouldn't be surprised if the MK1 could CARRY a 747, with alot of revisions of course
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:09:53 Probably needs to be updated to the MK3 actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:10:19 Imperial, I'd suggest swapping to the MK2, slightly bulkier but not only alot cheaper, but lighter as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:10:24 The MK3's more stable, but the armor makes it heavier
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:10:31 While you are NOT carrying the MK4 and 5
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:10:45 ... <@!216371990959882241> , check <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:11:38 Imagine seeing this come at you
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:12:14 Slight problem: Guns AND rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:12:29 Also by the way Imperial did I mention the MK5 is faster than the MK4?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:12:45 By not an insignificant amount either
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:13:12 Fonkl, I'm waiting for bigger weapons
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:14:01 Imagine if I actually got guns that size to cram onto the fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:14:32 Smash Bros Galeem beam anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:15:48 All I can say Farollo is good luck, you're gonna need to use the 0 radius explosive block I showed earlier
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:15:57 And so help me <@!298129144422858752> if that's the kind of joke I think it is
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:16:24 ... <@!487465127130562560> , can you not with the poor quality and poor spelling jokes!? Seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:16:31 HOOHHHh, I WANNA LAND ON THEM!
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:16:52 As this picture shows, nobody's been able to support my fighter yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:17:30 ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:17:51 **IF YOU DARE SO HELP ME** __**I WILL SMITE YOU WITH THE HOLY WRATH THAT WILL MAKE GOD JEALOUS**__ __***AND BURN YOUR SOUL UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT, GOT IT!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:18:13 Ahem, *cough* sorry, but it's just my most prized project to date
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:19:27 Trust me Trebox when I say that will sink if I land on it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:21:39 Your phone would probably break

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:45:24 You, me, DMs, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:47:43 You're clear, just don't do it again, alright?
creations-chat 2019-01-11 22:13:23 Double rank requirement for surface creations, sorry, lag machine though
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:30:03 Prop blades, not wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:18:28 <@!395091105517142026> Please ignore this, I need to test something
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:19:12 We're worried about everyone pings, as you can see in his username
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:19:19 Wait did it ACTUALLY ping everyone?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:19:31 Oh thank effing hell
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:21:05 Ballasts to the back to shift the weight back ontop of the center of lift
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:22:21 Ballasts at the back, helium at the front?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:24:21 Which conveyors? The big ones or the small ones?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:33:38 ..... <@!287297509796085761> , uhhhh, okaaayyyyy???? That's, why?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:36:01 <@251625298649546764> , you need to be ranked
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:36:58 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:37:14 I know right? <@!528043917233618948>
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:38:02 It's something new because people kept on taking the VIP server link and distributing it to banned people
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:38:24 And it's not fun when someone uses an explosive flyswatter and joins your VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:38:32 Imperial, ballasts at the bottom, helium at the top
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:38:43 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:38:45 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:40:00 Already in progress <@!313930200939233281>
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:42:21 Considering this thing was supposed to be built to support my fighter, nope
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:42:46 As long as they're different I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:43:07 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:43:25 Hold on a moment! I need to verify something for <@!313930200939233281>

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:48:12 Note: If you are ranked, you are able to suggest with "&suggest (Insert suggestion here)", but please, make sure to suggest good ideas, and make sure to explain your idea well, what purpose would it fit, rather than just a convenience suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:48:18 
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:49:10 <@251625298649546764> <@!298129144422858752> , both ranked!

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:55:29 Good luck Imperial, you'll need it
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:57:04 <@456226577798135808> , they can, I think they're like a cylinder actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:58:25 Oh, what button? C?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:58:41 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:02:20 Yoko, thing is we've had people get pissy at us about Swastikas
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:02:30 And the fact that this is Roblox, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:03:58 Yoko, just run with it for now, seriously, unless you want to kill Plane Crazy and probably both Madattak and Rickje's career in Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:06:50 Yoko, let me break that by saying: How can we enforce that?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:08:46 Rick's already implemented a way to delete saves, so he IS infact working on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:15:01 Right, Yoko, if you wish to have more freedom of speech, can you please take action on Roblox for this, not us? Once Roblox loosens their rules, we can do swastikas for days, but until then, we're going to be hamstrung to hell here
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:15:52 By the way, I challenge anyone to lift up my fighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:17:23 Uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:18:02 Sorry, no reward
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:18:11 I did check by the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:19:05 Yoko, please, if you'd like to do anything else, just send a message to Roblox HQ about why we should be allowed more freedom of speech on building games
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:22:20 It's Discord Terms of Service, so we'd have to boot you
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:23:06 Sibbling wants to get on, underage?
general 2019-01-12 01:46:54 Read the pins
general 2019-01-12 01:47:01 And Rick's already on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:00:50 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:01:16 Ooooohhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:01:22 Well we know what asshole's going to get banned now
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:01:27 Imperial, fire away
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:04:47 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:04:56 Who here is leaking links to him?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:05:27 Whoever's leaking links, tell him to either stay out, or he's being banned
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:06:09 The VIP server links
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:08:56 Sent a priority report to Roblox, unlike other people's reports, mine make people dissapear
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:09:06 And I mean it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:09:28 I don't know, Roblox seems to have paid attention to me for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:10:12 I remember one time I complained about one of Roblox's updates, and it got U-turned within the same day, complained about a game, suddenly the game's vanished off the front page, complain about people, they never log on ever again
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:10:33 One time, but yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:12:25 ... __***FUCKING EXCUSE ME!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:13:09 <@!217336009455566848> , GET DOWN HERE, NOW!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:13:29 
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:20:40 If __**ANYONE**__ finds that person, immediately report it to us
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:25:19 Lego, read <#490306593242611742> , now
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:25:22 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:25:37 __**GUYS, FOR CRAP'S SAKE CALM DOWN**__, people were using them in an NSFW way
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:25:50 Which breaks the rules, so rather than ban like 10 people, we've decided to shut down reactions temporarily, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:27:22 .............
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:27:24 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:28:13 ... <@!529550862872477706> , let me explain why that's not allowed
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:31:01 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:33:45 Right, you know what, if we don't start getting on topic again, I'm going to start handing out increasingly greater mutes, because this is getting out of hand, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:33:59 Starting at 5 minutes, 5 minutes more per player, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:34:34 Orange, I'll cover for ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:36:20 Not a problem Orange, plus the rest of us are on, and so far the server hasn't imploded yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:41:15 There, you got the purple name back manually
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:41:18 Happy?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:43:33 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:43:34 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:43:36 Just
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:43:54 <@!351809528209080324> , cut it out if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:44:25 Right right right, <@473820707571105792> , after we got a few, pissy, reports about various things, we've decided to crack down upon this stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:44:46 Please change it to something less, well, problematic?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:44:58 <@!439288206563999746> , Change the PFP, it's hinting at NSFW, at the very least wipe the face!!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:45:19 <@473820707571105792> , Look, blame the fact that we've got sensitive people on Roblox! Not on the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:45:39 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:45:45 Linh, I'm sorry, but please read the updated rules
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:45:52 We've gotten alot of complaints
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:46:56 <@473820707571105792> , I wouldn't give a crud, but other people do apparently! Look I'm sorry, but again, we've had __**ALOT**__ of complaints about stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:47:18 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:47:22 <@!355123674954858496> , UHHHHH
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:47:43 <@!355123674954858496> , please change, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:47:58 <@!305196796278210571> , yes, we are aware, but again, people have complained and whined, what do you want us to do?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:49:03 I'm temporarily kicking him until I'm getting a PFP for him
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:49:09 I've saved his ranks, so no need to worry
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:49:34 Oh wait nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:50:27 That's what I was going to do Imperial, sorta
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:50:44 .... Viet, please change it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:50:53 Again, we've had a ton of complaints
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:51:05 What's your Roblox account <@473820707571105792> ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:51:18 Wait seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:51:39 Well dang, huh
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:51:51 Mind changing your description to prove it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:52:08 After the last "water", put 114353 if you'd please, to prove it's really you
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:52:33 ... <@!223948083271172096> , it's less funny than you seem to think
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:52:57 It **IS ILLEGAL!**
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:53:04 That's the thing! __**IT IS INFACT ILLEGAL**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:53:11 ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:54:12 Ahem, this is a quick summary of that
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:54:31 It is infact illegal from what I've looked up, and it's not just this source
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:55:03 Linh, sorry, we were going through too much turbulence with that rule
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:55:46 .... <@!223948083271172096> , alright, you want me to find genuine proof from genuine law that it's illegal? I'll take the effort to search it up if you so challenge me to do so
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:55:55 <@!325320982602448897> , what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:56:55 .......... I want to say "No that's not good", but at the same time, mmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:57:02 Alright, you're good Viet
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:57:16 Xpert, it's an anime PFP that's drinking gas
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:58:06 Just change it please!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:58:36 <@!223948083271172096> , Here
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:59:40 ..... Whatever, believe what you want, no amount of convincing or proof seems to convince anyone anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:01:03 Look at his tag
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:01:23 His PFP was a screencap of Imperial's PFP
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:01:52 ... Xpert, look at who joined!
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:02:12 
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:02:14 See!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:02:50 ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:03:07 Xpert
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:03:36 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:08:14 "I read the rules" gets access to the Discord
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:10:17 <@!223948083271172096> , did you actually bother reading the rules?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:11:04 6 keys between P and E, 4 between E and N, that alone doesn't seem like a cat fell on your keyboard
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:11:28 <@!223948083271172096> , almost like it's a joke meant to try to evade a freaking punishment ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:11:40 FFS <@!223597699906273290>
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:12:00 ....
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 04:12:20 Screw it, Xpert, you take care of it, you're so confident in this
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:38:40 
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:39:33 It's low effort to freaking hell ...
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:40:11 "But the starter plane will get me all the ranks!" no it won't
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:40:44 Read the rules, rule 8 specifically ...
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:41:56 If I converted this with submarine controls, it'd probably get submarine commander
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:45:19 "It does effort" ... __**BITCH**__ please, that's not effort
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:45:29 THIS is effort
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:45:52 THIS is effort as well
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:46:12 A flying bottom half of a coffin? That's not effort
creations-chat 2019-01-13 12:48:19 ... I'm curious how you got the train conductor rank, and if we need to revise it
general 2019-01-13 12:50:56 Already done, it's such a low effort build ...
general 2019-01-13 12:52:54 "kul piston system" "ride on trees" Do we need to apply rule 10 as well?
general 2019-01-13 12:54:35 ....... So by "kul piston system" you mean the one already built into the map?
general 2019-01-13 12:55:03 Or are those the fictional "trees" that you see?
general 2019-01-13 12:57:14 ........... No offense Dan, but you are an idiot who doesn't pay the slightest bit of attention to stuff, do you notice the buttons literally on your left for swapping the tracks over?
general 2019-01-13 12:58:06 .......... I'm gonna stop now and say, until you put more actual effort into design, you're not getting any ranks
general 2019-01-13 12:58:19 And no, borg cubes don't count
general 2019-01-13 13:00:03 Dan ...
general 2019-01-13 13:00:06 <@!266571579159347204>
general 2019-01-13 13:00:11 Dan dan danny dan dan
general 2019-01-13 13:00:31 Do I seriously need to bitchslap you for stupidity or something? LOOK, TO YOUR DAMN, LEFT (Or in the camera's perspective, the right)
general 2019-01-13 13:01:13 Wrong spot Figors
general 2019-01-13 13:01:19 He's definitely aware of that
general 2019-01-13 13:01:59 __**THIS THING**__
general 2019-01-13 13:02:05 It changes the track direction
general 2019-01-13 13:02:46 The red/green button on there changes the tracks ...
general 2019-01-13 13:03:04 That's literally the whole point of it, to make it possible for trains to change directions
general 2019-01-13 13:05:06 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525864281498189834/533394792013627412/Capture_28.PNG
general 2019-01-13 13:05:58 If you aren't english, at the very least you're using a translator, which I can thank you for
general 2019-01-13 13:06:09 But "potato PC" isn't really an excuse
general 2019-01-13 13:06:25 Hell, I'm on a budget laptop
general 2019-01-13 13:06:37 Oh, for the GIF that's understandable
general 2019-01-13 13:07:39 ......... <@!266571579159347204>
general 2019-01-13 13:08:42 No offense if you're not lying, but I call bullshit on that, 13 year old stock PC here, runs surprisingly similarly to modern day laptop
help 2019-01-13 13:09:12 __**ANY MEANS NECESSARY**__, Good luck
help 2019-01-13 13:09:51 We literally do not care how you get lightspeed (Well, maybe aside from hacking the game) so long as you get lightspeed
general 2019-01-13 13:10:58 Wait what the heck?
general 2019-01-13 13:11:07 *Ignore the testing*
general 2019-01-13 13:12:27 __**OH**__ other game
general 2019-01-13 13:12:36 I was thinking of another game on the train track mechanism
general 2019-01-13 13:12:46 Still though, you have Google as a thing, right?
general 2019-01-13 13:13:05 Just search up "train", and see how it fits
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 13:13:23 That's, a tiny carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 13:16:00 Okay now this is worrying me slightly
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 13:16:09 2 different creators
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 13:16:11 Same design
help 2019-01-13 13:19:20 Just post a creation with actual effort put in it
help 2019-01-13 13:22:41 You've been ranked now
creations-chat 2019-01-13 13:26:50 Done
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 13:58:24 Looks more like a serious "NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!"
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:22:42 How? Just, how?
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:23:04 You're sitting essentially a nuclear submarine ontop of an aircraft carrier, and I can tell you didn't build it into one mold because it's at a weird angle, how?
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:24:00 This nightmare of a fighter just sinks any carrier I land on it
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:24:10 So, how?
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:24:14 
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:24:25 
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:26:39 Meanwhile I'm sinking custom carriers designed to hold up as much weight as possible somehow
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:26:59 Ask Ignacioel, Imperial, Battleship, and a few others about it
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:27:36 Well it is as durable as fuck (notice the missile impact?)
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:29:11 <@456226577798135808> , please explain your experience with my superheavy fighter
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:30:51 Well, it's durable as fuck, sooo
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:31:44 The Wyvern is stunningly friendly to carriers actually
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:32:10 Like, I've landed on carriers that are as large as it's wheel base, and they float just fine
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:32:42 It's actually shockingly effective
creations-chat 2019-01-13 14:32:47 *Challenge accepted, official VIP server*
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 14:36:46 <@!217336009455566848> , troll in the official VIP server, we need help

plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:21:31 Server 2, like you said
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:45:37 Sink, sank
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:45:42 Sunk
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 15:59:53 ...... <@!460538981344608258> , You put that, like we aren't aware of it
general 2019-01-13 17:49:52 That moment where, in a game with balanced fighters
creations-chat 2019-01-13 18:54:42 2 things, 1: Anchor block kinda defeats the purpose of that, 2: Excuse me <@463401263644803083> ?
creations-chat 2019-01-13 18:57:14 .... <@463401263644803083> , Read the rules, and quit being a smartass
creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:04:52 Same could be said for calling someone a noob "mr patrick" ...
creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:19:14 Current record's 4
creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:19:46 It's gotta be able to maneuver somehow, otherwise it's just a rocket
creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:19:56 Self powered, able to maneuver
creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:39:17 Still counts as a part
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 22:56:44 Right, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 22:56:53 <@218825012981792769> , let me explain
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 22:57:05 After a Discord Terms of Service update, we're not allowed to have people under 13 in the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 22:57:22 He already left
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 22:57:35 See? That's all you need to do with nice people
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:30:37 ?warnings <@511080180966752256>
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:30:45 Oh what the hell?
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:31:16 You know what, just,
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:31:22 Just don't do it again
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:32:00 It's highly suggestive is the thing ...
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:32:10 Just don't do it again
the-dump 2019-01-14 00:39:38 ... Something tells me that's NSFW, but you bleeped it out, which still isn't allowed
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:40:12 Someone say space fleet? Include my ~~massively oversized~~ fighter in it maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:40:36 Hey, the performance ratio is a fighter's, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:41:14 Oh FFS, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:41:28 So more like this?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:41:52 Daahhh, nobody uses bright colors anymore these days
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:42:28 Also FYI, yes that is Imperial, yes he is in a replica of my MK3, yes I did give him permission to copy it
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:43:22 These things **AREN'T** cheap
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:43:56 Just remember Imperial, they are built for actual in-game performance
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:44:07 And every motor's a major weakpoint
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:44:50 Your RC base would be vulnerable is the thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:45:07 Not to mention, I tried cameras, you loose ALOT of situational awareness
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:45:48 Ahehem, missile to the cockpit, this is the result, not alot of damage huh?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 00:46:04 (Ignore the back, I was testing durability, it's still combat capable by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:41:45 Bright, and painfully so (In all non-joking seriousness they look really nice)
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:11:22 ... Are you serious <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:12:21 I already did it
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:12:29 At least, if it worked ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:12:49 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:17:11 Just blacklist him, it'll break his creation in half
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:17:57 Again, blacklist him, it should make a solid box that his giant arm breaks against
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:18:09 If you time it right you can reset the progress as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:29:21 <@!351809528209080324> , don't try to lie to us ... https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/534422499191029770/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:31:20 I'll probably be always open for pinging, so ping away
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:31:26 Others though, might be a bit iffier
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:31:46 Okay okay I get it no need to spam it
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:32:05 Mmmmm, I'll give it to you for the videos, they have a 4/0 like/dislike ratio
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:32:47 Don't screw everything up and don't share the links there, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:32:57 If you do, you're not gonna be banned from JUST the Discord server
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:33:31 It's a bit harsh because we've had quite a few assholes in the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:33:41 Not, what I meant <@!313930200939233281>
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:33:55 I meant sharing the link with unverified people that may've potentially been banned from the Discord server
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:34:09 You're allowed to post your own VIP server links in there, but please, don't share the links to other people outside of the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:34:56 He's banned to hell for copying other people's creations nonstop
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:36:04 They make big planes, but I'm not sure if they're copying
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:36:52 I'd say just leave it, if cookie truly was an alt, they aren't copying anymore
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 17:37:03 As far as I can tell
bug-reports 2019-01-14 23:15:46 That's what happens with .wmv files, can you please put it through a converter?
bug-reports 2019-01-14 23:16:07 ... Roblox recordings always go in .wmv files
bug-reports 2019-01-15 02:26:33 Maybe start reading the pins and you'll find out why
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:31:20 We're looking for a spy because someone is repeatedly giving Deception links to the Plane Crazy VIP server, which he's using to troll bomb the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:32:07 We've reset them before, repeatedly
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:32:31 We're officially pissed to hell about this, so if you know anything, say it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:34:14 Oh damn <@!216371990959882241> , that looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:34:33 ......
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:38:52 .... <@!250338477202210826> , you're kidding, are you?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:39:06 Oh
help 2019-01-15 02:47:10 Ask if they have permission to do so
help 2019-01-15 02:47:36 If Legendary says yes, they're fine, if not, tell Alena it's bannable, and evidence has been sent to the Plane Crazy moderation server
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 02:51:25 ~~Meanwhile I'm slacking behind in my MK6 development because of the cockpit~~
help 2019-01-15 02:52:45 Again, tell Alena it's bannable, and that evidence of her copying has been sent to the Plane Crazy moderation server/team (Pick one of those)
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 17:15:58 Rickj- no I'm not gonna start that again
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 17:16:19 **NO DON'T START IT AGAIN!!!**
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 17:31:53 Moving to <#497142796961054721> about Vehicle Sim
general 2019-01-15 17:32:10 From <#384021699466756107> , is it just me or are the cars very, VERY bad at handling in vehicle sim?
general 2019-01-15 17:32:27 Like seriously, last time I played I was lucky to go in a straight line just holding W
general 2019-01-15 17:32:53 And that was WITH all the stability "upgrades" that they've claimed to have had
general 2019-01-15 17:34:14 Meanwhile I'm here holding down W and LITERALLY FLYING OFF TO THE SIDES DURING A DRAG RACE
general 2019-01-15 17:34:39 I shit you not, I hold down W and next thing you know I'm taking lift, this was a couple years ago though
creations-chat 2019-01-15 23:51:45 Imagine how much trouble I get clocking at around 600
creations-chat 2019-01-15 23:52:24 Yeeeeeup
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:44:06 Public server?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:46:14 <@158294656113836032> , I see you're online, can you please help with this? Official VIP server 1, an imposter in the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:46:22 Nevermind he just left ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:46:42 
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:46:53 Well what the fuck else am I supposed to do!? Just leave this be!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:47:28 He's in the Plane Crazy Roblox group as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:47:39 Which supposedly Madattak also has power in, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:48:59 I swear to god, this is going too far
the-dump 2019-01-16 00:52:41 ... Okay seriously cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:53:11 Tell me the exact moment he goes offline
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:54:01 <@456226577798135808> , You've got an imposter
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:55:45 IT IS DECEPTION!
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:55:59 As soon as the alt logged off Deception went off of playing Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:59:54 Shhhh <@456226577798135808> , the spy's here, remember?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:41:18 He deleted the part where he said he didn't bother reading the rules
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:41:34 I can't believe you've dragged me down back to this server ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:41:58 I was supposed to be happily relaxing out here, then suddenly you dragged me down here by being a little shitstain trying to frame me
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:42:12 Well guess what? **FUCK OFF**, I've had enough with that
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:42:24 .....
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:43:14 Let's see if the other bot works ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:43:33 God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:44:57 I __**WAS**__ on a health break after getting hatemail from someone framing me, but <@!421049901896433665> , THE FUCKING ASSHOLE HERE, decided to kick up a shitstorm, so I decided to beat his face into a fine ground paste
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:45:33 Black, mind testing the warn command on <@!421049901896433665> 's face?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:46:08 Oh, NOW it works ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:47:48 One guy banned for sending furry NSFW stuff, T33's warned twice, once for pinging Rick for no purpose (We could've checked back the logs to see why we banned him), another time for trying to frame me by deleting portions of the DMs
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:48:21 2/3 warns currently for him, so
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:49:02 They're tutorial planes sean
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:49:37 Not that tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:49:55 It's one people posted online, and so it's become the most famous VTOL style plane, which people have turned into various crafts
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:50:54 ?moderations <@192861290677534722>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:50:58 Wait what the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:51:08 What even?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:51:19 .......
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:51:32 That was not you ya dumbass <@!421049901896433665> , that was Future
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:51:40 .........

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:54:07 Are you shitting me?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:54:34 Fonkl, I did the ID to the textbook ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:55:02 It's "<@!(Userid)>"
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:56:36 Check <#473249376223887371>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:59:11 T33's banned, reason copy and pasted: Causing a general shitstorm, pinging Rick, being previously banned, acting very immature and trying to frame a moderator for "bullying" by deleting pieces of texts in DMs before promptly leaving the server to avoid punishments
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:59:34 I'm getting hate mail from the last damn person that framed me/impersonated me for something, I'm not dealing with it again ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:00:21 The in-game magnets he means I believe
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:00:39 They just create a pushing or pulling force relative to their block
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:01:58 Considering this was just yesterday, and I've had to shut down messages due to this
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:02:06 I wouldn't be surprised if they were still clawing at me trying to send hatemail
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:02:27 And yes, I did redact that guy's name, no, I'm not gonna reveal it, reason: It's not his fault, so don't blame him
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:03:29 Point is just leave him alone, he was misled by someone posing as me under an account with very similar naming
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:03:51 Which is why I will royally break someone's face if they pose as me
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:05:29 Excuse me while I vanish into nothingness again trying to take my proper break before one of my veins leading to my head breaks, ping me if it's something you need a mod for, but otherwise pretend I'm dead or something
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:29:47 Alright I'm stopping you three right there
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 18:30:01 No more mentioning of anything of that sort, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 22:37:11 <@!484363661121421332> , change your PFP and tag, now
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 22:38:07 That part
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 22:39:14 Doom, change it now or else you've got a whole heaping hell of alot more problems coming your way, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 22:40:56 Use this Doom
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:08:40 Too late, right
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:09:30 Move, **NOW**
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:12:10 ..... <@!367828860810821632> , try that again and see what happens
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:12:18 Also, **AHEM**
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:13:14 Send this and I'm going to rip it off and beat you out of the server with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:13:21 Got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:13:49 .... Just keep it to yourself
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:14:15 Well, with the way you reacted Orange, it seemed like you knew something, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:14:21 Meh, alright, whatever
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:20:23 ... God damn it, I'm used to Mee6, which shows the reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:20:28 For the reason: "Quit trying to be excessively toxic and freaking move to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind"
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 01:20:47 Hence the 10 minutes rather than a crapton of time
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 02:35:51 Hey, I only break troublemaker's faces
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 02:36:08 As long as nobody's setting anything on fire, I'm fine with whatever
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:14:25 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:14:39 Mysean's actually right, I do believe Rick did say that, since he now has the ability to erase builds remotely
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:15:55 How about a competition for the slowest car, using a specific wheel base that has to be touching the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:16:17 <@!509033189461983242> ! **HEY!**

**EXPLAIN THIS**
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:17:36 ...................
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:17:57 <@!509033189461983242> , If you read the rules, you'll know that they aren't allowed, not even as jokes
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:18:19 I'll just make you read the rules again, got it? Try it again and I'm gonna clobber you
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:22:36 People slightly forgot this exists
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:22:39 
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:23:03 Sorry for the inconvenience <@313603189935177730> , it's just a bit of confusion
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:23:43 Basically if someone's buildings screwy builds or stuff that breaks rules, I suppose based on that you can ping him, although, that's only reading back up the chat, so don't blame me if it's no longer true
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:24:00 I'd still suggest keeping it moderated and not excessive, alright?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:25:03 Again, he wasn't aware that Rick allowed it
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:25:43 I, THINK Rick can remotely delete saves now
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:25:52 Also, no you didn't do anything wrong Minecrafter, don't worry
creations-chat 2019-01-19 13:26:03 Damn that's a nice model
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:26:37 I'm gonna verify with the others if pinging Rick for bad creations is fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:26:45 So, for now, assume the answer's "no"
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:26:56 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:27:36 Ooohhhh, well alright, if you couldn't tell I've been on vacation from this server for a while
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:36:21 <@!509033189461983242> , that's the guy with the swastika creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:36:50 He ain't banned
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:37:19 __**OKAY ENOUGH PINGS**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:37:43 Next person to ping spam (without permission) gets clobbered, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:38:15 That means he's allowing you to ping him and only him
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:38:30 ... Technically pinging yourself is allowed
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:38:54 Hey, don't go overboard on it, alright?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:39:08 We've gotta keep the chat from burning somehow, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 13:39:14 ... FFS

plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:15:23 <@!468207489524039680> , it does infact work, I've tried it with super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:16:55 Select the specific block Jailbreakus
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:17:02 So you've gotta have the super rocket engine selected beforehand
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:17:08 Er, if you want to use the super rocket engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:17:47 RIP?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:17:53 I have no idea why that happens
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:18:09 I just did exactly what you did for the super rocket engine, I'm gonna assume that it doesn't work for slider settings
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:18:21 That's the most I can say, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 02:47:08 God damn it, re-suggesting because I forgot to put in "Triangle" before "Wedge"
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:49:04 I need a color scheme, be specific with the colors
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:49:27 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:49:35 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:52:06 I need a color scheme, I can't say what for, otherwise I'm gonna spoil it
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:53:37 No spoilers
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 03:56:24 Again, no, spoilers
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 04:32:59 Shout for me once it turns red?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 04:56:42 Already took a picture
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 05:06:24 What'd you use Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 05:08:28 Ah, lag servers, huh
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:56:03 Although this wasn't the amount of bombs required, this counted
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:56:34 Simply because the payload was so ridiculous that it could be swapped out for any sensible (and some just plain unsensible) payloads
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:56:56 Like a properly destructive design?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:57:12 Yes Grab?
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:57:22 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 21:58:11 For a properly destructive bomb, you'll want a large flat area of TNT, that has some drag near the back to make it fall flat end first
creations-chat 2019-01-22 03:58:06 That's why I always go in odd intervals in terms of width
creations-chat 2019-01-22 03:58:21 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc, you can center objects easier
creations-chat 2019-01-22 03:58:41 With Cframing, that, that would change, __**EVERYTHING!**__, but I don't want to push it onto Rick to do so
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:03:07 Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:04:21 Just, cut it out Integ, I've had enough harassment from you constantly following me around, trying to get a picture of my creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:04:47 And I'll warn you next time as well until I get to god damn boot you
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:05:01 It's 1 wing light set as high as possible in order to wash out any visible sign of the creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:05:19 My build is LITERALLY in that picture, can you see it? **NO**
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:05:37 The point of that was never for idiots like you to completely blind people's creations like that ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:05:52 I was working on the nose at the time
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:06:06 You drive over, flash the light, I can't see what the fuck I'm working on
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:06:41 ... Push a light up against a wall, the light shined onto the plot, since I don't have walls
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:07:04 I don't have to answer a damn question of yours positively or negatively Integex, now shut it and leave it be already
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:07:34 If you're so damn curious, here's the **ONLY** spoiler I'm going to give until I hit stage 3 of it, got it? I'm on stage 2 currently
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:08:14 Take a guess, I'm gonna give more info to more trusted sources, but otherwise you're shit out of luck
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:08:37 Integ, that's not up to date ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:08:46 I'm already well, __**WELL**__ past that point, that's just stage 1
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:10:14 ... For this one case, you're allowed to say whatever the fuck you want, as long as it doesn't break rule 2's "No NSFW" rule, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:10:56 Malicious, I'm allowing him to break rule 1 in order to say what he wants this time
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 06:13:21 *My prized project and probably last thing I build up until 2020, probably the only thing that's keeping me on Plane Crazy currently, and I'm obsessing over it* __**GEE, I WONDER WHY!?**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:19:28 And dead
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:22:25 I'm cranking him through the verification process again
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:23:02 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:30:32 We do this bullshit for a reason <@!398245378861826048>
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:31:05 If Ro-Ver doesn't work, we (Or at the very least I) will manually change your username to match your Roblox username, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:31:52 You aren't some special little snowflake that gets their own custom name on the server, especially since not even the highest up people (Mad and Rick) get to customize their usernames
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:32:16 And I have a freedom to break your face, yet I don't do that now do I?
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:35:55 Then we won't have to custom brand you with a nickname
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:13:38 He was spamming the same thing literally everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:15:46 Yes I am making it public intentionally, I am aware what chat this is
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:16:11 To copy that though, 828 blocks, good luck with that
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:17:13 ... <@511080180966752256> , I will leave you a bleeding corpse if you actually dare to try to copy it
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:17:29 To the point where I'm removing the picture and not posting any further builds
bug-reports 2019-01-23 01:28:14 Steel, just say what it is, and read the freaking rules
bug-reports 2019-01-23 01:36:48 Then just say it here, does it **REALLY** matter that you categorize it in the absolute most "perfect" spot ever?
bug-reports 2019-01-23 01:37:37 Empire, he said he was talking about a different game
bug-reports 2019-01-23 01:39:05 You know what? Fuck it, you deal with this Empire, if you're so insistent on pretending to be always right
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 01:50:09 Considering no plot size increase means no plot size increase, and Rick said that's not possible for a __**REASON**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 01:50:41 I mean, hell, he doesn't deny something unless it's literally out of his power
the-dump 2019-01-23 01:53:23 We figured out it was NSFW ... just be glad you're still allowed on this server

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:45:50 What are they made of?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:46:08 I meant like in terms of blocks, regular blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:46:17 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 02:46:34 Yeah, about that, I think I beat all of you, those are set to max weight by the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:30:34 30K build space left, or 30, whatever the . means
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:30:46 Either way, oh fucking dear
general 2019-01-23 03:36:37 It's been suggested a billion times over ...

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:45:28 I need, **ONE** last bit of info, what color should I make gunpods, and what color should I make internal components?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:45:39 Then I can start cranking out my final build in full
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:46:06 .... You guys okay?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 03:46:25 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 04:09:33 I'm on the final stretch of the MK6
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:15:46 I need one last bit of half-open sourced development before I go into tweaking and finalizing for my project, anyone (trusted) wanna help?
general 2019-01-23 05:21:57 Isn't in the command list, so
general 2019-01-23 05:22:05 Unless, wait
general 2019-01-23 05:23:30 Alright, just don't flaunt it around too much
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:24:59 Answer: They don't
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 05:28:28 Isn't there a new HUD thing for modern pilots that lets them see through their own aircraft basically via cameras or something?

creations-chat 2019-01-23 05:56:27 Just prove that you can drop a sufficiently sized payload to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:06:13 There's VIP server PVP mode ya know Sam
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:07:55 Yeup, sadly it's half broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:08:00 Guns don't work and missiles are one-shot per spawm
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:08:09 But hey, better than nothing, right? (Guns were nerfed to the ground)
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:08:39 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:09:09 I'll try to find your server
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:11:09 Wait, **ARE** you in a PVP server Sam?
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:12:05 Nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:12:28 I'll just show you this <@!191664513911750657> , it's still combat capable by the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 06:13:16 Alright

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:12:47 Just,
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:12:51 Are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:13:27 Do you realize how much of an absolute pain in the ass it was to get this thing to have the performance it does?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:13:40 Just, d- <@511080180966752256> , do you realize how much effort was pumped into this thing?

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:14:35 "No U"
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:15:07 Now then, back to it, just, screw off and mind your own business Integex, I don't care about impressing an asshole
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:16:16 You pester me nonstop to see it, to the point of light spamming my build, and when I do show you it you start trying to say anything negative about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 02:21:59 Here's the reason: "Harassing mods to be unbanned, acting the same as before, and again, accusing people of bullying, the exact same reason he was banned for previously"
the-dump 2019-01-24 02:47:33 __**OKAY I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH DISTURBING FOR ONE DAY**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:00:45 Can you say anything positive about anything except your own damn creations Integex? Like seriously, prove me wrong by saying only positive things for a day, starting tomorrow (Technically today for me)
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:15:31 Which server?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:16:16 Eh, nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:17:10 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:17:22 Yeah?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:17:46 Well huh
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 05:20:56 Spy, which server?
bug-reports 2019-01-24 06:45:52 ... <@456226577798135808> , can we help you?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:46:48 ... That's <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:47:10 And can you quit acting drunk before we temporarily send you out to sober up?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:53:42 Hey, what can I say? I enjoy making these things
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:54:34 They were the hardest part, FML
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:54:50 They just **NEVER** looked right, even after like 30 iterations of them
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:55:28 It looks pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:55:40 Here have a top-down view
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 06:55:50 And a diagonal underside
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:06:48 The thing is, motors are vulnerable to all weapons, not just ropestorms
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:07:13 Like, I've tried firing at turrets, just one  sneeze and even heavily armored turrets suddenly have a giant loose block on them
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:07:43 Ahahahaahhhh, have you seen how armored the damn main section is? It makes the Wyvern's look like crap
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:08:58 It's actually using many of the techniques I've learned from the past actually, namely what survived and what didn't while my Wyvern was being bombed to shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:10:32 Which part to be exact?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:12:01 The bridge between the front assembly and the main fuselage?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:12:35 I hammered it out a bit, it ain't thin anymore, and if it is, then what the fuck's thick!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:13:12 Hey, I'm in a light mood today, you can **TELL** when I'm in a bad mood
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:13:39 Like, I will go just plain genocidal when I'm in a bad mood, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:14:32 Think of it like Nezu (If you know who I'm talking about, don't spoil it)
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:16:13 Simply put I want to grab a curved knife, stab it in his spine and twist it until I've carved a clean hole through his spine out past his heart
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:16:41 But in a more serious and non-genocidal note, I hate him, he tries framing me as bullying him
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 07:16:54 I mean it's pretty good to be honest
general 2019-01-24 07:20:14 Erase that, now
general 2019-01-24 07:20:41 <@!385247005003218948> , I said, **ERASE THAT, NOW**
general 2019-01-24 07:21:02 ...
general 2019-01-24 07:22:43 The hell is that <@459620345536577547> !? That's definitely on Roblox
general 2019-01-24 07:23:53 It's the last part that's inappropriate
general 2019-01-24 07:24:24 God damn wolf, that looks really nice
general 2019-01-24 07:24:39 Alright, we're satisfied now <@!385247005003218948>
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:43:14 Normal controls allows for a broader and more potent turning rate, mouse controls allows for full precision, but it's **ALOT** slower
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:43:19 And trust me, I've tried both
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:44:02 The control surfaces would automatically adjust to give you a slight pitch and yaw to whatever direction you wanted
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:44:35 They do compensate on whether they're flipped or not, but still
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:45:22 ... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 16:45:32 Can you break it to him that it's obvious that he's lying
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:11:54 You can use the Asteria as the flagship or logo or something, and I can capture a gif to prove it's performance
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:51:30 Daily reminder: DON'T BREAK RULE 2, that just winds up with your own face broken
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 22:29:47 It's planned, and likely under development, now keep calm
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:56:12 <@456226577798135808> , can you please not use a .wmv file? They can harbor viruses, so I'd like to request you to use some form of converter
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:56:38 I'm assuming it's the "hurburbuhburbl" noise, which is an easter egg noise
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:57:17 Stop motion animation?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:57:32 I wonder how viable a full stop motion film would be
creations-chat 2019-01-26 00:00:30 I mean, I myself didn't actually put effort into the colors until I reached the final stage of my creation, so
creations-chat 2019-01-26 00:01:26 See? Told ya, colors ain't finished
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:11:43 Grablador: Stop motion animator
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:16:31 So Battleship basically has AP rounds?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:16:42 Or are those sabots?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:24:52 "TURRRRNNN DAMN YOU" levels of slowness?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:25:32 <@!250338477202210826> , that is never gonna roll
<@!454809803223465984> , it looks like a giant gun with a spaceship built around it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:26:05 I mean, that's not a put-down by any means, sorta like an artillery ship to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:26:46 Farollo, that kind of carrier will never, and should never roll, unless you want to disrupt the hangar operations
creations-chat 2019-01-26 00:28:16 Helium on top, ballasts at the bottom?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:28:41 He's probably just gonna rebuild it, even if Rick comes over to clonk his head
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:28:53 Hold on while I come over to scare him shitless
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:35:44 That's hard to fix, or so Rick says
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:35:59 Place a block parallel to it somehow and use that as a guiding rail
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:50 How wide is it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:07 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:47:23 I remember one of the Ace Combat missions had you fly through the damn thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:48:20 The Wyvern's 19 blocks wide, discluding performance boosters, 21 with them
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:48:31 I can't fit through that thing!
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:48:58 Because he's not 19 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:49:26 I used this picture to count it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:50:27 Maybe it's an alt of one of the members?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:51:04 ..........................
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:53:12 Meh, I've talked to him, last I checked he promised not to put up a show for others' sake, so don't just pitchfork and stab him, yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:53:55 If alts start flaunting around shit, I'm gonna personally stab his eyes with a burning pike
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:54:11 But otherwise just assume it's fine for now, alright?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:55:58 The original had a fuckton of turrets, and 4 sets of engines, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:56:56 Mhm, mhm, *Writes down notes*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:57:42 Imperial, just treat him like a regular person until he puts up a fit
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:59:36 Okay no nevermind we need to change the link, we've got an impersonator on here
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:03:12 I'm gonna turn off the VIP server until whoever the fuck is leaking it owns up, got it? We've had far too many trolls and such popping on and ruining the experience for everyone
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:17:39 Whoever's leaking the links, **OWN UP**, else they're only coming back to specific people
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:20:10 Figure it out and hand them over to us and we'll re-open the servers, otherwise they ain't coming back to regular people, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:20:36 Your reward is the ability to use VIP servers again
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:22:37 He saw the chat
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:22:45 .... __**OWN UP, ALL OF YOU, NOW**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:23:18 I'm gonna start booting mule accounts if whoever's leaking doesn't own up immediately
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:23:25 The problem is Malicious he still has the VIP server link
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:23:38 I checked, it's accurate
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:24:00 .... <@511080180966752256> , you don't seem to grasp the situation
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:24:09 No matter how much we change the link, someone leaks the link out constantly
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:24:55 <@!362351190618538005> , we used an IP ban on him, so he shouldn't be able to come back
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:25:44 Well we've solved the VPN problem, only trusted people will be able to access the VIP server now, and if he throws a fit in the Discord server, well we're gonna bag him
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:26:34 ... Reblex
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:26:41 You act this is easy
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:26:53 If this was easy, don't you think we would've done it already dipshit?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:27:01 Don't you think we've tried what you suggested **ALREADY**!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:27:35 Just look out for anyone screwing up anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:30:25 <@511080180966752256> , We aren't giving access to those we don't trust
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:32:35 Just don't fuck it up royally and we'll start handing out the link to those we trust again, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:32:49 ... __**NO SPANISH JOKES**__ For crap's sake
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:00 .... <@!362351190618538005>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:11 <@!362351190618538005> , we have a server for verifications
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:17 That's not the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:28 __**RIGHT, ENOUGH NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOKES, GOT IT!?**__
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:38 <@!362351190618538005> , tell us something we DON'T know, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:33:59 As long as it's not excessively spammy
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:34:48 ......
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:34:58 Seriously guys?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:35:15 I'm on the edge of ripping someone's face off (metaphorically of course)
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:36:11 Next person who's not on-topic is gonna get a mute for 5 minutes, and I'm gonna increase it by 5 minutes per person I mute, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:36:33 Go to <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364> with this at LEAST for crap's sake
help 2019-01-26 01:38:53 I think you can't have a base as wide as that, er, it's hard to explain
help 2019-01-26 01:39:03 Basically you can only have a pair of wheels attached per motor block, any wider and it doesn't work
help 2019-01-26 01:39:06 Or, longer?
help 2019-01-26 01:39:09 I don't know what to say
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:39:47 Turn it off and on again
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:40:02 .... Just plain driving in, or?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:40:29 Ah, that's normal
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:41:01 If we made it so you could shoot rockets through, then turrets would be invincible
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:41:11 My suggestion: Build something better
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:41:41 I've never had a problem with being spawncamped because I built something that was fast enough to immediately take off as soon as it spawned
help 2019-01-26 03:03:59 Control panels, you've set them to automatic haven't you?
help 2019-01-26 03:04:42 What you're likely lacking is pitch, control panels will automatically roll you and start both yawing and pitching with the movement of the mouse
help 2019-01-26 03:05:06 However, if you want the best performance, although it is far less precise and doesn't auto-stabilize, I'd suggest using keyboard controls
help 2019-01-26 03:05:40 If you want automatic however, add control surfaces to the front and back, that'll give you more pitch, add more to the edges of your current wing to get roll, and add some vertical ones to the front or back to get yaw
help 2019-01-26 03:06:13 For reference
Pitch: Up/down
Yaw: Left/right
Roll: Clockwise/counter
help 2019-01-26 03:07:04 Not a problem, if you don't mind complex controls, manual keybinds are your best friend, as they add far more precision
help 2019-01-26 03:08:11 While with automatic controls, control surfaces will only go halfway on roll or pitch to satisfy their needs, manual keybinds will allow you to dedicate them entirely to either roll, pitch or yaw
help 2019-01-26 03:08:38 And since the further away from their respective plane, they're at, the better, doing so will let you do crazy maneuvers
help 2019-01-26 03:09:05 They also allow you to add engines to assist your turns, which can lead to even further maneuvers, to the point of absurdity sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:10:56 When you take damage VIA guns, blocks become more transparent, take a guess what happened
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:11:11 In a way
help 2019-01-26 03:13:07 Manual or auto controls?
help 2019-01-26 03:13:47 Add more control surfaces to the left, right, top or bottom side of the center of mass
help 2019-01-26 03:13:53 As far away as you can infact
help 2019-01-26 03:14:06 Just read what I typed to Jelly and convert it with roll in mind instead of pitch
help 2019-01-26 03:14:35 Are they outer-most or inner-most?
help 2019-01-26 03:15:28 You likely need more, or assist thrusters
help 2019-01-26 03:16:07 Most maneuverable plane (That I know of that's above 100 blocks), notice anything?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:16:23 We murdered it due to constant trolls appearing and breaking every single fucking thing in it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:16:38 Like, __**CONSTANT**__ lag bombers
help 2019-01-26 03:16:52 Look at how many control surfaces I have compared to the actual wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:17:12 We'll gradually restore it, or if you want to expedite it, tell us who's leaking the link constantly
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:17:59 Because **SOME FUCKER** on here keeps on leaking the link, which is leading to people building light bombs, rocket spams, involuntary rope storms, or worse, and thus crashing the server for most people that came on
help 2019-01-26 03:18:33 The ones farthest to the left and right should be for manual roll, the inner ones should be for pitch
help 2019-01-26 03:18:45 If all else fails, add more control
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:19:43 Problem with that is people are hitting the 1500 build limit currently, which is just absurd
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:20:20 Trust me, I doubt that's 200 engines and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:20:32 You only need 50 to cause some serious damage *coughcoughropestormcoughcough*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:21:32 __*Watch as that gets raided to*__, but seriously, we really do need to crank down on this
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:22:26 I'm gonna check just how many super rockets I'm using
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:23:24 Ropes I agree with, but engines, just one of my engine pods alone use about 100 super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:23:59 They really, really don't, they allow for stuff like this to happen
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:24:39 If anything I need modular engines or stronger (but far larger) engines, otherwise it won't work at all
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:25:32 Just how do you even use super rockets on builds under 500 blocks, or builds with ridiculous wingspans!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:25:56 Look at this! Look at the **WINGSPAN** on this, more of this thing's wingspan than actual fighter believe it or not
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:26:38 I've got 1258 super engines left on the Asteria, crank it all the way down to 100 and it's as good as dead
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:27:54 That would mean placing a premium item behind a pay wall, which is against our philosophy, right? *Right!?*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:31:12 Here's a suggestion: Nerf everything, but make modular engines that rapidly grow stronger than their equivalent amount of super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:31:43 Controversial idea, I know, but it'd solve the problem of super rockets being too tiny, while large builds need something bigger (God knows how many super rockets I have in my Asteria)
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:37:49 It's currently just "if engine not attached to block, don't spawn engine" I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:37:59 Yet add one block and attach everything else to it, it thinks it's fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:38:07 I don't know, ask Rick the specifics
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:06 Jesus H christ, which servers?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:13 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:33 Votekick can easily be abused, I've had it happened before
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:40:41 Again, easily abused Xpert, once a group hits that critical value, they can basically just vent out a server, and if enough players decide to raid Plane Crazy (For whatever reason), they can effectively stop anyone from making new servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:47:35 Xpert, come on! That just causes the problem all over again
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:47:52 At least when people go "!server" or whatever, we'll get a list of who's doing what
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:48:03 ...... Alright
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:48:32 Very well, I'll leave you to manage the VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:48:37 Do what you may with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:53:59 Meeediiiiiiiic!!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:55:21 Public server, bring a big build
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:55:29 Preferably maneuverable to
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:00:03 I decided to leave, it was ridiculous
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:27:33 <@!250338477202210826> , Garuda 1 reporting
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:37:57 Mind showing me the logo?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 04:38:23 A bit, minimalist, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:23:15 Meanwhile I always pop my builds up at freaking 1 in the morning and nobody notices them until they're burried
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:24:24 Yes, I get it doesn't have any fancy moving parts, but can we appreciate huge performance builds? No? Faaaahhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:25:03 <#519624169730605086>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:29:34 I skipped step 3 and simply jumped to step 10
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:30:07 I mean, 6 upvotes on making a solid state 1.7K creation fly like a freaking 300 block superfighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:30:25 Yeup, this thing, even with all the lag
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:30:32 Flies like this thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:30:45 It's 1.7K blocks <@!304253531886583808>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:31:53 Black hole bomb
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:36:22 __***7 UPVOTES FOR SOMETHING 1.7K BLOCKS, SOLID STATE, MANEUVERS VERY WELL, THAT TOOK AN ASS TON OF TIME TO MAKE, WHYYYYY!?!?!?***__ God damn it, maybe I should just start making motor crap
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:37:02 I'd be fine with it, if it wasn't for the fact that this thing could literally fly backwards, maneuver like a fighter and take the mother of all beatings
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:37:17 Like, do I need to record a gif for you guys to see just how fucking maneuverable this thing is!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:37:36 And yes, I'm **PISSED OFF**, because it's getting next to 0 recognition
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:38:33 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:38:41 That, felt like an insult, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:46:37 You're shitting me ... in 1 night, Integex's bomb theory got almost as many upvotes as my Asteria, granted he got one downvote, but still
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:48:23 They get you praised, and Xpert pins high upvote creations
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:48:52 You know what, when my internet stabilizes tomorrow, I'm gonna grab a gif of just how fucking maneuverable the Asteria is
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:49:45 That's 1.7K blocks that looks unique as well?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:50:27 ... I get it, you want to shit over it because I didn't want you seeing it while it was in a copiable state
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:50:56 You know what, I'm not gonna bother anymore to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:51:01 Think whatever you want
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:46:30 **Ahem**
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:46:51 ?warnings <@!264873879640604673>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:47:36 "Cracks one joke", I think you left out something there, not only a bad joke, but one that potentially breaks rule 2
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:47:55 Now cut it out before I cut you out of the server, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:52:02 
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:54:27 ... <@206463437356793856> , verify if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:54:54 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:55:20 ......
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:55:39 "CUT IT OUT We don't need you breaking rule 2, controversy, over and over again"
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:55:52 Honestly I could've warned you for the previous thing, so I'm using that to boost it anyways ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:56:46 And to be honest <@511080180966752256> , I've just come to accept that you're just nonstop against literally everything I say/do, so I don't give a fuck about your opinion anymore, because you have yet to prove my theory wrong
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:57:03 It's <#497142796961054721> anyways for fuck's sake ... just, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:57:31 Worked Ricey, welcome to the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:57:42 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:57:47 Don't do a DragonMage on me
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:57:53 Don't, just, don't do a fucking DragonMage on me
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:58:15 I will genuinely stab you (in a metaphorical way) if you do a DragonMage on me and pull out bullshit excuses
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 19:58:56 ... You're toxic, not calm
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:00:14 ............

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:00:20 Just
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:00:25 You know what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:01:07 Here's the reason: 
Trying to argue with a mod about legitamizing swastikas, and claiming that he's waiting for them to "cool down"
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:01:32 We'd cool down, __**IF YOU DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY TRY TO PISS US OFF**__ god fucking damn it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:01:51 And to be honest that's not ugly Xpert
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:03:37 To be honest, absolutely nobody gives a damn about originality, so I'm just gonna follow the crowd and go with Xpert's tutorial, maybe a couple of iterations upon it to make it my own ...
help 2019-01-26 20:11:46 Get a better computer (And I mean that literally), or lower quality settings, it's caused by lag
help 2019-01-26 20:13:44 Comparison: Me and Imperial both own a Wyvern, but Imperial's Wyvern wobbles alot, and during moments of extreme lag or bad internet, mine wobbles to, but the wobbles stop when I decrease quality usage
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 20:15:43 TLDR, this is what he did: 
Trying to instigate fights, raids, and constantly trying to harass the mod team with various hypocritically abusive speeches, all in all, __**GET THE FUCK OUT**__
help 2019-01-26 20:16:13 <@!194241218811658240> , Can you **NOT** try to make our life a living hell? There's a reason we seem a bit pissy recently, and that's because people keep on being hypocritical ASSHOLES towards us
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:03:16 That's a lower rank, but alright
creations-chat 2019-01-26 21:26:34 There, now he has 11, and god damn it Turismo! Why does your thing get 10 when mine gets only 6?
creations-chat 2019-01-26 21:29:35 __**COMPARISON!**__
creations-chat 2019-01-26 21:30:20 And literally everybody said "it's just a plane" to me yesterday ...
creations-chat 2019-01-26 21:32:05 So originality's dead in this server? Good to note ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:50:20 .........
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:50:45 What royally pisses me off is that you just keep on finding excuses to make me seem pathetic
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:51:09 "It's just a plane", as Turismo gets master
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:52:35 I'm not calling it bad to be honest, to be honest I like Turismo, he's a nice guy
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:53:30 What pisses me off is that you just keep on saying a plethora of negative things about it, to the point of light spamming my build because I wouldn't let you in while it was in an easy to copy state
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:54:12 Well I'm "just pointing out stuff" as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:55:32 I kept on fucking telling you to cut it out, to leave me alone, to stop trying to get a glimpse of it while it was in a state that was easy to copy, yet you, you special little snowflake, thought that even while **EVERY** other person respected the decision, you deserved to see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:56:28 ... Both of you cut it out, neither are being a smartass
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:56:47 <@456226577798135808> , lightblocks are very annoying because they can cause lag and wash out builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:57:02 Scroll up and tell me if you can see my build in that shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:57:24 ... They were made, so people could use that creatively, not so people can just blind everyone in it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:57:35 It bled off into the plot while I was working on the damn nose of the creation!
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:58:15 If you couldn't tell by this, it spans from the very tip of the plot to the very back end, because that's literally how long the damn thing is
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:58:49 Simply put, I was working on the nose, reshaping it to be thinner, and he just blinds me entirely
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:59:06 And, as you put it, "it's just a ship"
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 21:59:26 And you flaunt it around like it's the next coming of golden Jesus
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:00:09 <@352928457358835715> , <@!351809528209080324> , both of you can you please just cut it out and leave it be?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:00:44 What I'm bitching about is your treatment towards my build ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:01:16 "Unfair warning" CAN YOU SEE THE NOSE I WAS WORKING ON IN THIS PICTURE!?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:01:43 I told you to leave me alone, I told you you weren't going to see it, I told you to quit bugging me about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:01:56 And then suddenly you drive over with THAT amalgamation to try to pester me into letting you see it
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:02:14 And do I have to tell you that for common fucking sense?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:03:51 <@!351809528209080324> , don't throw insults, that just winds up making them look better
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:04:56 ... It's because you keep on pestering me about **THIS, BLOCKING ME WHILE I WAS WORKING ON THE NOSE WINGS
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:05:12 For reference, this is a zoomed out picture, do you see the nose wings?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:05:47 ...
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:05:53

plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:07:54 How about no, unless someone can see the fucking wing tips here
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 22:08:15 1 light block set to full power's equal to 100 light blocks packed into the same spot set to full power, I don't give a fuck if it's 1 or 100

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:38:33 Depends on what kind of spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:40:05 Something tells me that won't go well, considering a block's already halfway to 100 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:41:10 What kind as in, do you want a capital class? Newtonian? Starfighter? What kind do you want?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:43:15 Dropship, depends on what you want, if it's for pure troops, make it a solid state, the Star Wars Clone Wars LAAT is a good example of this, bombs and troops, you want to model it after a Skycrane usually
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:46:10 You'll want decouplers to make an escape pod that works, make sure it completely encases the user, and has at least one seat inside, the more space efficient without sacrificing looks, the better
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:48:07 Honestly I'd say plan out the shape beforehand, or plan out at least to a point where you can stop for a while, and don't expect alot of glamorous results
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:48:41 Okay, we've got a __**LONG**__ day ahead of us in terms of actual production then
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:49:01 Compare that to the Asteria
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:50:04 Exterior pods are supposed to be gatling, interior are heavy cannons, nose guns are light cannons
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 06:50:12 Oh yeah, I remember, chairception

plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:06:47 <@!255361087262818304> , That's why my fighters are all solid state
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:07:44 *As you get bomb netted by a drone*
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:07:53 Who cares if you can't find the folds if you hit literally everywhere at once?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:09:44 If I converted my fighter's engine pods to be giant net bombs, well you're kinda screwed then aren't you Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:09:57 Then again pretty much everyone's screwed against that
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:10:48 Fire them infront of your plane, the impact disrupts your flight capabilities, I detonate them when you hit turbulence

creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:30:02 <@!377527949295091714> , just make an actual original craft and quit being unoriginal ...
creations-chat 2019-01-28 22:42:59 One more low effort build and you're gonna get creations banned, got it? Put some effort into it or just sit back and watch what others build, and don't try copying, we'll catch on and delete your saves, and if you keep it up you're gonna get banned not just from the server, but from the game
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:03:07 ... <@!377527949295091714> , you apparently don't get it, at all
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:04:21 1 wing panel, 4 delta wings, 3 control surfaces, 1 engine and 1 seat are literally less effort than the freaking tutorial plane
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:05:56 Even I've done that, and I pissing hate making tiny tiny builds
creations-chat 2019-01-28 23:07:02 Hell, someone made a 5 part plane with full degree of movement, knock a part off of that that can move around in every axis reliably and I'll be impressed
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:08:24 You have those, they're called main pilot seats
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:09:10 Ah, you meant it like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:21:10 Ask someone to paint their craft the same color and see if it works
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:27:05 We've got a copier Rick, the same guy who sent Empire a friend request believe it or not
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:36:18 I genuinely never used vertical engines to assist flight, however, I've used engines to assist rotation (Infact that's how alot of my crafts work at zero velocity)
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:37:27 Observe closely
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:37:53 Others can still see particles, even if you turned them off
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:38:26 Control panels work at higher speeds, not lower speeds
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:40:32 ... Can we just agree that, the fact that that gets almost the same amount of upvotes as my Asteria is complete and total bullshit?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:40:49 Like, props to you Integex, but seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:42:24 Xpert, what sucks more is to work on something for days on end (A few hours each day true, but still), and get the same amount of upvotes you got for a slightly tweaked version of one of your previous crafts
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:42:58 Who the hell cares about smallest crafts? They're done
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:43:11 What's more impressive is making huge crafts that fly like a tiny craft that look awesome
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:44:12 Also, Xpert, is it fine if I repost tomorrow in an attempt to get more upvotes? I feel really cheated that Integex's micro plane got almost the same amount of upvotes as the Asteria (Still happy for Integex getting the upvotes though)
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:44:27 Wait, sure to me, or?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:44:37 Ah, alright
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:45:24 Then I'll make aesthetics and function MERGE, by posting a GIF
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:45:28 Wait, testing something out now
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:45:55 It works
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:47:20 I focus on function over fashion, although I will admit, I do need to add more variance to the gunpods
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:47:38 Anyone have suggestions on what to add for a 6.5 on the Asteria?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:47:53 Specifically the gun pods
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:48:10 Paint's out the window Xpert, although I could try it when I have spare time
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:48:17 I just need a new scheme's the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:48:33 That shouldn't be the case Integex
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:49:44 Ahehem, that's literally every single one of my planes Xpert
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:49:57 I added reverse thrust to literally all of them
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:50:50 That plane, is very, very poorly built
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:50:59 I can even see the engine imbalance from here
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:51:27 It's probably a tutorial plane done by somebody who doesn't realize what balance is
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:51:34 Ask Snyfort to do a video on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 02:52:31 Ehhhh, this is slightly off topic now, but look at this guy's animation style! If you can commission him to make a video on this, do so

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:35:30 Right if that's gonna be the focused reticle, left if it's just gonna be on the outer border like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:36:49 Compared to the other side?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:37:41 Ah, it'll get in the way for sure, but it's interesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:38:20 Bottom seems better to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:39:18 Is it gonna be performance based, fashion based or what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:40:43 Hmmm, go slightly above then, see if you can modify a reticle
the-dump 2019-01-29 03:42:29 Asteria here, returning fire to either side
the-dump 2019-01-29 03:43:07 Insanity, that's what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:44:01 He's using motors, so he's not entirely dumb
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 03:44:08 Seems like he's trying to lift up a package of some sort

the-dump 2019-01-29 03:57:29 <@511080180966752256> , I try to remain neutral in these kinds of things and even I've gotta agree that's fucking shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 04:18:20 Pretty sure the idiot-proofing's gonna be broken by someone, not being an idiot over it, but moreso pushing it past it's limit

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 15:01:22 TLDR: Currently in-game bombs have equal blast force, whether concentrated or spread out, so the best use of firepower is a spread out cluster bomb, nukes have been tried with little to no success
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 15:02:50 Then please mention that instead of seemingly ignoring it, it can be seen as rude in a way
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 15:09:59 That intercom is there because people keep on forgetting, if people didn't forget and try to ruin everything, we'd be fine

creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:15:53 For the love of crap Plasma, if it's well and truly that hard for you to grasp what makes a creation good, and what makes it crap, then maybe you need to rethink your building policy

creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:18:22 Do I need to give you a warning for trying to twist my own words against me? There's a difference between "no effort, mimicing other people", and "Tiny plane that looks good" you know

creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:24:50 It's clearly a joke for fuck's sake ... Joke builds are allowed, but if you're trying to pose as an actual builder with a joke build, you're gonna get lynched

creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:29:53 That's, a bit too tiny for my liking to be honest <@!351809528209080324> , but you know, a plane's a plane
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:30:16 I mean, hey, it's like a tiny toy plane to be honest
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:30:56 By the way <@!377527949295091714> , if you're wondering why I'm not shouting at him about it, it's because he put effort into balancing that, you already followed something that was made before
creations-chat 2019-01-29 16:31:13 And fucking hell I'm rushing because I'm almost late for classes, so can we **PLEASE** end this quickly?

creations-chat 2019-01-29 19:49:03 Basically you convert all of that potential energy from height into kinetic energy in the form of momentum
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 22:19:31 I mean, I have this, dump out the extra ordinance and you have plenty of room in those pods

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:00:31 Well, of course there's a couple of smart people just on alts, but most bacon hairs?
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:03:36 Hey, what other building game has aerodynamic physics?
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:04:27 Well, true
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:07:33 They broke WASD for any non-player character movement for a brief moment
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:09:37 Sure you'll be seen as literally Satan after that, but you'll be richer than Bill Gates afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:10:40 They're either pay to win, pay for exclusives, pay to skip excessive grind or just a blatant attempt at a cash grab
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 17:11:22 Quite literally in one game I saw one, like 50 gems or something for 500 robux, yet the first enemy you kill gives 200 gems each time

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:55:23 Then no offense, but you're a dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:55:33 I'm serious, if we have to make "don't harass people" a rule
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:55:41 That's not even common sense, that's just being **HUMAN**
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:56:20 Point is you have absolutely no sense at all if you think there's no rule against harassment
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:56:56 To be honest, people like you are why we have to actually make rules, instead of trusting everyone to simply manage themselves like natural humans
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:58:51 .......
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:58:54 Jekeri
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:58:58 If that's racism
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:59:14 Then everyone's experiencing it, I wonder why nobody else has complained about it, and some have even adopted rule 10?
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 18:59:21 Oh wait, __**BECAUSE IT ISN'T RACISM**__

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:03:01 **BEFORE** that
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:04:55 Jekeri, just tell me, what's the origin for the whole "racist" thing you keep on whining about? Because you were whining about it BEFORE the warn
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:05:27 ........
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:21:17 King, be glad that you have 1X3 wedges, let alone 1X4, .5X2 and so on, we only had 1X2 back in the old days
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:21:45 The amount of work Rick's put into the game is **ABSURD**, so can you please show some appreciation and satisfaction of/with it?
help 2019-01-30 19:28:59 Depends, if you mean the iron cross, no, Swastika, **OF COURSE YES**, current German flag, no
help 2019-01-30 19:31:46 I mean, it shouldn't be racist
help 2019-01-30 19:34:02 If someone does complain about it, shouldn't be too hard to change, right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:37:15 Depends on the look you want
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 19:37:31 I always found that a bit of tapering off like so helped

plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:25:08 Only reason it doesn't match currently is lag, reduce the lag it receives and it's literally able to do the exact same maneuvers the Wyvern can

plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:25:55 And if you want me to prove it, I will
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:27:09 ......
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:27:23 <@!299336998718668821> , not exactly the smartest idea while infront of a mod
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:27:45 Did it break any rules Striking?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:29:15 People do that, and it's stupidly effective against weak builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:29:36 Nice, feed it a fish
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:30:25 How so?
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:31:10 Which part? Describe it in the best detail possible?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:31:55 Say'nt like this'nt again and I'm gonna clobber'nt you, understood'nt?
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:32:30 Ah, nosecone, best you can do is use long wedges at the base, followed by shorter ones, maybe inverted ones if you've got that much room to spare, before putting a pyramid ontop or leaving it flat
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:33:09 Ehhhhhh, my internet's screwed up, sorry
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:33:39 Try using 1X4 wedges, then 1X2 and 1X1, if you need to shave it down, 1X2 and 1X1
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:34:05 Then start with the cockpit first, that's what I did
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:34:32 Design the cockpit, and you can get a good size reference for the rest of it
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:35:23 Try utilizing half wedges, and making your cockpit out of solid materials instead of glass
creations-chat 2019-02-03 05:36:03 Dunno what to say then
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:36:17 Cool, now encase it, and make it look nice
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:40:34 To be honest, bullet spread is stupidly useful against tiny planes, because they're mostly CQC planes
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:40:52 But against well armed/armored planes? Yeah, good luck, with that
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:41:27 Just as an example here: Every piece here is connected by an average of 3 other pieces, you've gotta chip away at alot of stuff before it splits
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:41:35 Also, it's pretty nice, although what's with the crash cage?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:41:58 Incase something bumps into the cockpit?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 17:55:55 __**GRAB!**__

plane-crazy 2019-02-04 02:40:14 If something's causing you to turn, do the opposite of it

creations-chat 2019-02-04 03:32:40 Seems like the bot's down, it'd normally port it over just fine
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:35:49 Ahem <@!431900303227617283>
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:36:12 600 max speed, maneuvers on a dime, near impossible to shoot down, very focused firepower and is known for floating
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:36:22 Zero helium and ballasts inside
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:36:46 Ballasts are heavier
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:37:05 Shave off the armor, modernize it, and you get the Salamander, around 250 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 03:41:09 Imperial's still a mod
creations-chat 2019-02-04 04:06:33 ... <@511080180966752256> , I'm not an idiot
creations-chat 2019-02-04 04:06:54 What made me say that was I tried re-uploading the bottom link, which should've, and had worked before, it didn't
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 04:42:21 Why does everyone want the big passenger crafts dead?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 04:47:12 Should I join in, see how much damage I can cause?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 04:54:37 Alright, gonna prep the Wyvern
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 04:54:51 Which server?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 04:56:00 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:13:21 So, pair of challenges: Make an aircraft that can reliably hit the Wyvern, and make a carrier that can carry the King Dragon and/or Asteria
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:15:30 You sure? Imperial's custom carrier designed to lift up the King Dragon failed at that
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:16:19 No anchoring, that's no fun
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:16:28 Anchored, a single block could float with the Asteria on it
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:17:06 It's nice, I had fun poking holes in it
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:17:18 If I had my guns, you'd be in A LOT more trouble
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:24:54 The most important ones to remember are no NSFW PFPs, that's against both our and Discord's rules, you need to be over 13 with parental permission (But who pays attention to the last part anyways), and that's it
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:25:17 Abide by both and we won't rip your face off like an angry tiger
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:25:29 We had to after a ton of people kept on asking to make swastikas to offend people randomly with
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:27:45 If you try to glitch this thing, your OWN creation will probably glitch before mine does
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:28:02 Also no moving parts = "FUCK that's durable" (Yes, swears are allowed in this server, just not harassing swears)
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:28:24 King Dragon's size
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:28:29 
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:29:05 It's got 0 helium in it, probably why it's so damn heavy
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:29:27 The thing is: The less of a variety of stat affecting parts you have, the more durable it is
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:29:55 As shown by how, after repeatedly bombarding the Wyvern with missiles, it's STILL combat-capable in this state
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:30:14 And I don't mean "It can fly", I mean "It can outmaneuver people and shoot back at them with accuracy"
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:30:47 Good luck on that
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:31:51 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:32:05 If you want to prove it, I can bring out the Wyvern and tail you endlessly
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:33:23 I see em, people have tried using rear weapons to get me, doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:34:42 Quite literally G4M3 launched a single huge missile at me, it couldn't maneuver to hit me
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:37:58 Trust me, you won't beat the Wyvern, it's too durable, maneuverable, and rapid
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:38:39 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:39:17 If I installed the tech it should have lore-wise, it'd be able to outrun a fucking Tsar bomba (Provided the pilot starts running as soon as the bomber arrives on-scene)
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:40:55 Detects the launch on long-range radar, either intercepts it if it's not targetted at them, or out-paces it if it is targetted at them
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:41:10 Remember, these things float like fucking paper airplanes, so they're pretty damn light
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:43:46 I mean, I literally wasn't hit in the VIP server by 2 people taking pops at me, 1 with a fighter, another with a giant missile
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:45:47 Alright, care to try to beat my fighter then Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 05:48:22 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:03:29 Do you want to keep the same look, or do you want pure performance?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:03:49 Haxo, tell them copying's bannable, and use the anti-copy blacklist function
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:04:31 I think it makes your creation invisible to those you blacklisted
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:05:19 Aesthetics and performance don't go hand-in-hand, infact, they tend to be opposites of eachother (I just managed to hit magic for some reason), so which do you want?
general 2019-02-04 06:05:33 Memes in <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:06:50 Keep turning surfaces as far away from the center of mass as possible, pitch at the front/back, roll at the left/right, yaw's same as pitch, but vertical
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:07:05 Basically, think of how to apply each and every single bit of force as far away from the center of mass as possible, and don't go parallel to it
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:07:13 The moment you run parallel side-by-side, you're fucked
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:07:39 Then make the next best thing Kublox: A one button build
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:07:57 Or just use an explosive block to delete something in order to start the machine as a zero button build
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:08:30 Explosive block missiles tend to be not worthwhile
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:11:19 About 600ish
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:11:59 At top speed, it maneuvers within the plot zone (Not the build zone, the big giant slab that all the plots are on)
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:14:22 Basically double the size of the build zone
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:14:30 That's how fast it turns at max speed
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 06:15:36 Oh, if you want a random machine, but can't make it fully autonomous, make it a one-button build
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 19:24:58 What's the issue?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 19:26:10 0.9 blocks are used for one specific side not attaching on
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 19:26:29 That's, weird gopn

plane-crazy 2019-02-04 19:28:04 Ah, didn't Rick say not to disclose it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 20:40:17 It's unimpressive to be honest, I've made my crafts perfectly zero gravity before in much the same manner
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 21:15:30 Is that an AWACS vehicle or something?
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 21:15:43 Cool, it should be more to the middle
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 21:51:39 <@!334232774502514689> , the reason why is because the builds are so huge that we need to have a save limit, and before you go "Oh just make things resizable", that'd break things, and before you go "Why not optimize it?", Rick's already optimized it to hell, and "BYOM does it better", it's alot easier to build a ground vehicle than a flying vehicle, especially one that has some semblance of physics
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 22:02:28 Tell him "You mean fortnite cube?"
plane-crazy 2019-02-04 22:07:23 And it goes around the entire track without derailing once? Including the really sharp turns and junctions?

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 16:11:30 For pitch, control surfaces at the front and back on a horizontal axis relative to the center of mass, for yaw, same ordeal, but a vertical axis instead, for roll, control surfaces at the left and right in a cylindrical pattern

plane-crazy 2019-02-06 01:38:05 Try to keep memes in <#495286269459300364> , if it becomes a recurring incident, we will mute, warn, and eventually kick or ban you, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 01:41:52 Look, we ran without it, and everyone was very confused with the server before, hence why it's a thing, we don't do these things without a reason, and a very good reason
the-dump 2019-02-06 01:44:51 .....
the-dump 2019-02-06 01:45:02 Memes still have to apply to the rules, otherwise Roblox would shout at us
help 2019-02-06 01:48:36 ..... Are you really?
help 2019-02-06 01:50:57 <@456226577798135808> , Are you really 5 years old? If so we have to ask you to leave, and if you won't leave or correct that statement with proof, we will use force to make you leave
help 2019-02-06 01:55:31 You do realize if I took that joke seriously, you'd be out the server already, right?
help 2019-02-06 01:57:11 Beceause we've had people who have made jokes like that
help 2019-02-06 01:57:39 If you wanna measure weight in Plane Crazy, I'd suggest using flotation, balance scales, equal weighted rockets, or so on
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:16:15 Time it takes to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:16:52 "Almost none" as in? From the very start of the pitch to the very end, max speed
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:17:38 Just give me a rough estimate, I don't care how long it takes to roll, just how long it takes to do a full sideways loop
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:17:44 Use yaw if it's faster than pitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:19:43 6 seconds, not full pitch for about 1/3rd of a loop, so about 18 seconds for a full turn at top speed
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:20:32 So your little niche with your fighter is a constant vertical thrust?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:21:57 Ehhhh, little quirk, the novel thing about it, basically what makes it unique compared to other craft, because if I'm not mistaken, it also seems like you went for a bit of performance as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:23:37 You need to balance it out __**REALLY**__ well if they're on the ends, but it's also prone to tipping if you put it on the CoM (Center of Mass)
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:23:45 Basically it's harder to do, but more rewarding
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:26:05 For reference, about 4.1 seconds, max turn at around 600, little novel thing about it is reverse thrust
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:27:16 Color scheme?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:27:38 Trust me, the fuselage wasn't built that way intentionally
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:27:57 ..... It was mostly built for performance, plus look at the ground, what do you think?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:28:07 I didn't exactly have alot to work off of ya know
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:28:54 Compare it with this then
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:29:09 Note: It's even faster, but maneuvers about the same, only slowing down due to lag
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:29:41 And it's ~1700 blocks compared to 310-320 (What can I say? I like my builds to be functional)
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:31:06 I was constantly asking for a new color scheme suggestion ... Where the freaking crud were you when I was asking it!?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:31:32 Also, if I could use two deltas to make the border more natural, I would, that sadly isn't available however
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:32:15 Like, just pretend it's smoothed out
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 04:34:14 Don't mind if I join in to show you the function side of these crafts
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:05:31 Not half bad to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:06:26 Sure, although guns only work on public servers, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:08:16 Accept it
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:08:57 OH MY FUCKING GOD MY COMPUTER IS NOT BEING HAPPY AT ALL WHAT SO GOD FREAKING DAMN HELL EVER, FUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:09:11 Might have to postpone it, internet's just frozen at this point
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:11:56 Yeah, no, we need to postpone it, something's fucked up my computer beyond comprehension
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:12:07 Nope, wait, wait!
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:13:37 I'm used to spawn campers
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:13:58 Join me
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:16:05 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 05:28:07 Nada, internet isn't stable enough fro that
help 2019-02-06 06:22:14 <@!329303436300386306> , did you actually bother reading the rules? You don't have to mass ping unless it's an emergency, like the entire server's burning down
help 2019-02-06 06:23:56 That's not exploiting, that's modifying a vehicle to attempt to troll others' vehicles, use blacklist, and if you want to fight their vehicle, spam blacklist on and off repeatedly
help 2019-02-06 06:24:54 .... The hell are you even on? No offense, but Robloxian figures have next to ZERO mass compared to even a single block, so what exactly are you on to think that that could possibly happen?
help 2019-02-06 06:25:56 ..... Excuse me, but I need to ask a few things
help 2019-02-06 06:26:37 1: Are you over 13 years old? Due to Discord Terms of Service, we must, by the law, ask you to leave if you are under 13 years old without parental permission to be on this site
2: Did you even pay attention to the wheels?
3: Even if it was an exploiter, unless he's specifically walking over to your vehicle, why is it a problem?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:00 ... "Yup" to which parts?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:15 And you're sure of this?
help 2019-02-06 06:27:48 ... You're typing like you're well under 13 to be perfectly honest, making multiple incorrect statements with highly improper grammar in short burst statements
help 2019-02-06 06:29:25 It's literally past midnight over here, being tired doesn't mean you can't correct your statements, or at the very least have some grammatical correctness aside from just rolling your face on the keyboard (And forgive me if that sounded rude, I tend to get a bit pissy when I'm tired)
help 2019-02-06 06:30:56 Let me point you to section 5, with the important section underlined, and the area that was broken underlined twice
help 2019-02-06 06:31:34 .....
help 2019-02-06 06:32:03 We can and will force you out of the server if you break any of the rules, got it?
help 2019-02-06 06:33:01 We'll forward it to Rick for him to add the person to the banlist, but aside from that we cannot garuntee any action to be taken, especially since it seems so dubious, how so little mass can launch someone so far away with such force
help 2019-02-06 06:34:11 .... If you keep Blacklist turned on, he should clip through, and if it doesn't happen, then I don't know what to say
help 2019-02-06 06:34:17 We've literally had a guy try to do what you described, and the blacklist function worked on him
help 2019-02-06 06:34:28 Are you sure you aren't turning on "anti-copy blacklist" instead of blacklisting the specific person?
help 2019-02-06 06:35:52 If you've played the game for 2 years, then tell me at least 4 non-block parts we've had before the major update
help 2019-02-06 06:37:14 ..... Something tells me you're lying on a few fronts, wedges, beams and blocks don't count, how about that?
help 2019-02-06 06:39:27 ... Can't verify if you got the badge early or not, since you won't let me see your inventory, which makes it even more dubious
help 2019-02-06 06:40:14 That's your first straight lie
help 2019-02-06 06:41:00 I was gonna do a badge check to see just how early you got the badge, because you need to have gotten it extremely early in order to have been even remotely truthful, considering your particular join date
help 2019-02-06 06:43:53 ... Having the badge or no-
help 2019-02-06 06:43:55 ......
help 2019-02-06 06:44:16 
help 2019-02-06 06:44:26 You're lying
help 2019-02-06 06:45:01 You are lying, now get out, we don't appreciate liars
help 2019-02-06 06:45:14 I will literally screenshot every single page of your badge inventory to prove that you are a liar
help 2019-02-06 06:46:06 
help 2019-02-06 06:46:56 Do not, lie to us, got it?
help 2019-02-06 06:47:19 It's a warn for attempting to lie to us, about a badge that has not been released yet
help 2019-02-06 06:47:55 I expect that image in 10 seconds from this post
help 2019-02-06 06:48:12 Time's up
help 2019-02-06 06:48:29 That's how long it took me to take the screenshot, crop the screen, upload it to Discord and send it here
help 2019-02-06 06:48:32 ......
help 2019-02-06 06:49:15 You were lying about owning both badges
help 2019-02-06 06:49:24 Spy, it shows when it was last updated, not when he got it
help 2019-02-06 06:50:11 See?
help 2019-02-06 06:50:43 As much as I will fucking seal club a troll or idiot into a twitching paste, I will defend anyone against unjust punishments, and punishing for that particular date is unjust
help 2019-02-06 06:51:13 However, punishing for lying about owning both badges, especially since it's a known fact that the second badge is impossible to legitimately obtain, and is infact not even coded into the game
help 2019-02-06 06:51:26 That's legitimate, don't lie to us
help 2019-02-06 06:52:22 You thought it was released, so you could lie to us, in a vague attempt to validate your statements, which wound up backfiring horribly on you ...
help 2019-02-06 06:53:02 .... I grouped up a warn and a ban into just a single warn you know, now quit acting like a god damn 5 year old piece of cancer
help 2019-02-06 06:53:33 That's not the point, just, look, read over the rules very thoroughly, rather than just gloss over them
help 2019-02-06 06:54:09 If you aren't breaking any of them, nor are you bugging anyone to an extreme, you are probably in the clear to do whatever you're thinking of doing
help 2019-02-06 06:54:38 However, if you break any rule, and bug people to extremes via mass pings or an annoying ignorance to what people are saying, then we will not hesitate to boot you from the server
help 2019-02-06 06:55:02 And as stern, unfair and brutal as that sounds, in practice, it's surprisingly gentile, now can you **PLEASE**, listen to that statement?
help 2019-02-06 06:56:15 And one last thing, even if the mod team seems like they're asleep, some of us decided to mark ourselves as offline, so you can't see them, that way any troublemakers get caught
help 2019-02-06 07:04:30 Look, I don't usually have to do these long, boring and stressful rants, but when someone lies to the mod team, multiple times, and mass pings the mod team, even though that's literally listed as something to not do within the rules, I have to, so do forgive me for this
help 2019-02-06 07:05:55 As I mentioned, he lied to the mod team multiple times in highly disprovable ways, and he mass pinged the mod team
help 2019-02-06 07:06:31 Infact he's lucky to be on the server, because we (or at least I) suspect he's under 13, and Discord Terms of Service legally obliges us to respectfully ask any and all people that are under 13 without parental permission to leave the server, and use force if we have to
help 2019-02-06 07:10:59 He claimed to own both badges before, which is an impossible thing, considering he's unable to earn the other one
help 2019-02-06 07:12:00 
help 2019-02-06 07:12:29 Even though you didn't know, it's still a false claim
help 2019-02-06 07:14:40 ....
help 2019-02-06 07:14:45 Are you serious?
help 2019-02-06 07:15:25 Rule 10, I literally told you to parse over the rules
help 2019-02-06 07:15:57 You know what? No, just, get out
help 2019-02-06 07:17:13 Fucking hell, we have these rules for a reason ....
help 2019-02-06 07:17:56 For the reason why I kicked him: "3 warns, 1 for mass pinging of mods that were online at the time, 1 for straight up lying to the mods, DragonMage style, and 1 for blatantly breaking rule 10, just because he could"
help 2019-02-06 07:19:07 ... Get out
help 2019-02-06 07:20:06 Look <@!268949543293288448> , don't break a rule infront of our faces, especially mine, I will break your face if you try that, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:20:14 3 warns, 1 for mass pinging of mods that were online at the time, 1 for straight up lying to the mods, DragonMage style, and 1 for blatantly breaking rule 10, just because he could
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:20:25 And immediately after he came back from a kick, he broke rule 10 again, just because
help 2019-02-06 07:21:23 You aren't warned, it's just incase you get any funny thoughts, alright?
help 2019-02-06 07:21:33 Look, I'm pissed after that last guy thought he/she/it could break rules infront of my face
help 2019-02-06 07:21:59 ... Swearing is allowed so long as it's got a reason for it, such as someone provoking me
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:22:12 <@!181620033921875968> , you already have light speed!
help 2019-02-06 07:23:12 You'd think common sense would dictate that
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:23:43 E+14 means you have 14 0s to the right of the decimal
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:24:00 So 1 E+5 is equal to 100000
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:24:07 <@!478024687364997131> , what do you need help with?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:24:30 ... Post a picture?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:25:13 It looks like that because of the way you've designed your wedges
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:25:28 It takes alot of effort to make only wedges work, so don't worry if the first one looks bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:25:34 Just practice alot and experiment
help 2019-02-06 07:27:49 ... I'll assume that's an insult directed at the other person, for your sake, yeah, we know, we have to deal with that alot
help 2019-02-06 07:28:08 And by alot, I mean, this is a Roblox server, and Roblox is a site practically legendary for it's toxicity
help 2019-02-06 07:28:17 What more do you want me to say?
help 2019-02-06 07:29:54 Oh don't get me started on this jeff, yes, claim you're head of a large server all you want, yes, claim you know the rules all you want, yes, claim you know what to deal with all you want, but until you directly put yourself in our shoes, which apparently you are incapable of doing, considering your view on us, please, don't comment on how __**WE**__ do things
help 2019-02-06 07:30:16 We don't do anything without a reason for doing so, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:31:19 And it's self-detrimental to go against the general community, so why would we do that?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:31:56 I don't know, considering I've never had to reach that far that many times, use 1X7 beams layed on the floor to tell, and if that's too imprecise a unit of measurement, downgrade to 1X4 and 1X1 until you have the full measurement
help 2019-02-06 07:33:47 Yes yes <@!268949543293288448> , we get it, just don't try to run us around unless you know directly what we have to deal with, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:35:15 Use motors to simulate this yourself if you wish
help 2019-02-06 07:36:12 We get it Trump, now please just leave us be, we don't need to hear about the billions of people you had to take care of, if you want to prove it to us, try to help the moderation team and provide as much useful info as possible without minimodding, got it?
help 2019-02-06 07:36:41 And if I seem extremely pissed off, I'm tired, the last guy pissed me off, and I'm also stressed out, so please, start by making it easier for me somehow
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 07:36:52 Then encase the motors and hide them
help 2019-02-06 07:38:40 ... <@!268949543293288448> , Are you referring to me, or the person I just booted?
help 2019-02-06 07:39:52 Ah
help 2019-02-06 07:42:14 Just, boot that person, if they well and truly are a staff member, then they've lied and deceived their way into your crew, as well as pay no attention to the set rules
bug-reports 2019-02-06 21:48:42 ?warn
bug-reports 2019-02-06 21:48:43 Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 00:46:39 Still occupies a 2X1 spot, so a less powerful jet engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 02:30:10 It LOOKS very bulky, but look at it closer and you realize it's got the structural integrity of a tinfoil hat
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 04:23:51 <@!310223662039171072> , Easter egg ever since the game was first made
bug-reports 2019-02-07 05:57:04 ... You two, cut it out
bug-reports 2019-02-07 05:57:09 <@!171455671173251072> , I'll handle this
bug-reports 2019-02-07 05:57:27 <@456226577798135808> , You get that excuse, __**ONCE**__, and that's it, got it?
bug-reports 2019-02-07 05:57:55 Tell your brother, cousin, whatever, if he comes on and starts posting shit again, I'm going to personally grab both of you (in a metaphorical sense), and throw you out the door, got it?
bug-reports 2019-02-07 06:00:57 Not a problem, now just enjoy yourself and act as normal
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 06:04:43 Look for a giant freaking fountain of snow, if you don't see it, look for a sign and a cave
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 07:06:07 They've already been made, and why can't you make it?
the-dump 2019-02-07 07:08:32 Isn't, that, like 90 different kinds of illegal?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:05:54 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:06:16 God damn it, I typed "@ satan", and that's what I got
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:06:22 <@!539826827901009920>
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:06:39 <@!539826827901009920> , Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:07:55 <@!539826827901009920> , Rules still apply in DMs you know, so don't try harassing group members, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:09:31 Reminder, if people bug you in DMs, feel free to report it to a trusted moderator or administrator, got it? Please don't bug Rick or Mad about it, they're busy enough developing the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:10:14 <@456226577798135808> , he's human, what do you expect
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:10:22 ... <@!530774331081621504> , why is that here exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:10:40 It's fine, just don't screw it up too often, otherwise I've gotta clock ya, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:10:52 It's, creepy, but could use more detail
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:12:10 TMI Future, it's not NSFW, but freaking TMI dude
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:16:55 <@!539826827901009920> __**AHEM**__
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:17:29 We don't take kindly to harassing other members of the server, now I'd like to kindly ask you to stop <@!539826827901009920> , or you will be banned, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:18:09 We have pictures that would like to beg to differ <@!539826827901009920>
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:18:19 Now cut it out, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:18:45 ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:19:02 Right, now then
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:19:16 <@!539826827901009920> , We __**WILL**__ ban you for acting toxic and hypocritically, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:19:41 He showed me the whole message from start to finish, making sure it transitioned properly so he didn't leave anything out
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:19:53 And if you'd like to please argue against it, send me proof it's not the whole thing via DMs, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:20:09 Then <@!539826827901009920> , __**PROVE IT**__, don't just spout toxicity everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:20:25 It's the easiest way, simplest way, and if there's valid proof, we'll ban the other guy
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:20:28 ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:20:32 <@!539826827901009920> , Then send your own proof
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:20:41 Is that really so hard to do? Unless you yourself are lying
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:21:08 <@456226577798135808> , Okay enough of that
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:22:03 ... <@!539826827901009920> , I'm still waiting for your defense, how hard is it to get the screenshots?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:22:16 And we will assume you yourself are editing them if you don't come up with them in a timely fashion
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:22:53 ... God damn it, Discord, as "accurate" as ever
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:23:34 This took about 10 seconds to do
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:23:41 It's not that hard to capture a picture
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:23:45 .......
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:24:26 ........
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:24:44 <@!539826827901009920> , You just proved that you're toxic
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:24:51 Right then
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:25:31 <@!539826827901009920> , You've got one last chance, quit being toxic, and start being nice to the people in the server, if I see one more problem from any of the other people in the server, and I mean __**ANYONE**__ in the server, I will not hesitate to permanently ban you, and request Rick to permanently ban you from the game as well, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:26:11 <@!539826827901009920> , Quit trying to pose it off as his fault, from the pictures we've received and that you've shown, you were the one to start the fight first
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:26:27 So, cut it out, and simply act nice, and we'll be fine, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:26:50 You may or may not start by apologizing to him, but however you do it, just do not be toxic anymore, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:27:20 And remember, __**EVERYONE**__ has access to various admin/moderator DMs here, so they can warn us if you start acting toxic, got it <@!539826827901009920> ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:28:18 I checked, as far as I could tell it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:29:02 I'll check again
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:33:07 Can we please stop using spoiler stuff? It's annoying to sort through
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:33:19 Not on the same grounds as using another language, but still, it's annoying
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:33:27 Because we have to manually click on everything to make sure it abides by all the rules
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:04 ... Guys
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:12 Spy, don't, at least not yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:18 I get why they're doing it, it's a novel thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:25 But at the same time, guys, can you __**PLEASE**__ cut it out?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:41 Like seriously, this is the reason why we made it so people can't talk in other languages, it's really difficult to moderate
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:34:58 I might be part computer, I might not be, who knows?

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:39:39 Right right right, let me explain why that's considered NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:39:52 A bunch of trolls decided to post it in an NSFW way, across multiple channels

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:42:04 ... Well I guess I'll give you that, but cut it out, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:42:15 ............
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:42:24 The whole "Be on the correct" channel thing is alot more lenient
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:42:32 But guys, can we please move stuff to the correct channels to avoid clutter?
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:43:22 Dark, try a performance starfighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:43:58 Something like this, stupidly durable, fast, maneuverable, focused mostly on performing well
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:44:37 Well what about a fashion starfighter then? One that's got alot of aesthetics, but in-game doesn't function that well
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:45:14 I don't do well with prop blade based builds, sorry
general 2019-02-07 20:45:42 Look, we wouldn't have to do this if people weren't so toxic and spewing crap everywhere in an NSFW sense, so please do understand, we didn't have to at first
general 2019-02-07 20:46:06 Don't blame us for it, blame the people that used it in an NSFW way, thus making it NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:46:29 That's a Star Wars Jedi Starfighter, basically the grandfather of the A-wing interceptor
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:47:34 Here's a few examples from a game, Freespace https://storiesbywilliams.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/freespace.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:47:49 Not a problem, although if you want more winged-like examples
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 20:49:09 Well, alright, I'll show you one from the Gradius series anyways

plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:00:40 Okay, that, was a bit, welp
bug-reports 2019-02-08 20:06:47 PVP in VIP servers doesn't work
bug-reports 2019-02-08 20:06:55 Galaxy, I have rockets and guns on my fighter, and it works just fine
bug-reports 2019-02-08 20:06:58 Maybe it's motors?
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:15:41 It's actually true, matches the speed, turning rate, and judging from the layout, durability
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:16:01 Only thing it doesn't have is reverse thrust
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:17:51 About 600 speed, does a full 360 loop in about 4.1 seconds at max speed, ability to swap between dense and spread fire (not on the fly however)
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:18:06 And as durable as absolute fuck, considering it's still able to fight very well in THIS state
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:18:53 Yeah, if Robo's rivals that, it'd probably be pretty nightmarish to fight
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:19:15 Depends on what kind of smart you mean
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:19:59 Also (Ignore the flexing), this maneuvers just about as well as the Wyvern, aside from the lag of course
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:20:18 Now all I need is guns that properly fit those huge barrels, and what do you know, I own the servers
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:20:40 Did I mention that the Asteria ALSO has reverse thrust?
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:21:06 King, you try making reverse thrust that's actually useful in combat
plane-crazy 2019-02-08 20:21:51 Trust me, on paper it's easy, in practice it's a bitch to manage

plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:28:12 I'm trying to fix things now ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:28:25 Integex, Orange, can you both please cut it out and drag it to DMs so we don't cram up the server?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:28:42 <@!429665143677255681> , no there's not punishments for talking, unless it breaks one of the rules

plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:31:10 Right to drag it back to on topic, anyone have anything nice to show off?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:31:57 Malicious, that would be a fuckton easier if everyone would take the courtesy to agree to that no matter what happens, but of course, something has to happen all the time
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:32:25 Also, pffff, well huh
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:32:33 Did it seriously get that irritating, people calling it a Bugatti?
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 01:32:51 ... Integex, this is why we can't have nice things

plane-crazy 2019-02-11 17:45:48 You need to be ranked
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 17:46:25 That's mostly to prevent people from leaking the link, which has been a recurring issue, which has lead to people lag bombing the everloving crap out of the VIP servers, so nobody can use them
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 18:00:57 ... That won't get you anything really, since anyone can make anything with little to no effort, you need to actually have a creation that required some degree of effort to create, otherwise literally any person, including trolls, would be able to access the server, and I've already gone over why that's a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 18:04:37 These are all examples, and if you dare try to copy, good luck, with that, you will be murdered (metaphorically) for that
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 18:06:39 .... Unless it's the most amazing truck in the world, it's not gonna impress anyone
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:08:24 Please don't use .wmvs, they can harbor viruses, use some form of converter
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:11:08 Well that ain't half bad actually, give me an estimate on the part count?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:11:28 Namely on the biggest trailer you can get
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:23:58 Pfffff, impressive, give a part estimate for that?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:25:06 I meant like how many parts did you use for it?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:26:33 Now you're ranked, try not to leak the servers as per the aforementioned problems we've had
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:27:24 It's "&suggest (Your suggestion goes here)"
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:27:36 And tank, you know the drill, be sure to double-check if your suggestion was already made

plane-crazy 2019-02-11 18:35:08 Scroll up and THINK for a moment please, do you seriously think you'd be the only one to have noticed it?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:36:13 What do you need Prov?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:36:26 Also, that's not entirely true Turbo, but I am pretty much garunteed for that
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:36:39 Show proof you achieved both of those ranks?
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:36:53 Also, the ranks are being remade soon, replicator will not apply, sorry
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:38:12 Possibly
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:38:32 <@323414243074506763> , Surface creations require double the part count, sorry
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:39:00 Seriously impressive builds might get nudged to the next rank if they're close enough (Like if they're 10 parts away or something)
creations-chat 2019-02-11 18:41:44 Ehhh, again, replicator might be gone soon, so who knows? Plus you need upvotes anyways for replicator ranks
creations-chat 2019-02-11 19:00:59 Replicator might be removed soon, so stay tuned for that
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 19:12:30 You do realize one shot and you're as good as dead in that thing, right?

plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:02:40 Tutorials? Seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:03:34 You're never gonna learn how to do anything in the game if you only follow tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:04:16 Don't expect ranks for those
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:05:23 A few things, VIP servers, suggestions, it's mostly to prove you know what you're doing
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:06:41 ................
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:07:30 And you'll never figure out how if you lazily follow tutorials (No I'm not being mean about this, that is actually the cold hard truth)
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:40:32 We have both the tutorial and <#539172463267807306> for a reason, and we also have a thing called Google that we all have access to
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:41:01 "Well at least I put effort in, unlike you" is my go-to counter for stuff like that
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:51:56 Unique starfighter, nobody makes  those
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:55:06 Am I the only one that even tries to make original single-pilot builds anymore? Like, come on
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:57:24 Trust me Turismo, the nose is the hardest part for many
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 02:57:47 Infact, me, being the dunce I am (Joking here), I started with the nose and developed from there, thankfully I was able to change it halfway through
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:00:20 I mean, that's a pretty good nose all things considered
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:04:46 So you made a gun system?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:12:59 Not inventor-worthy, Empire made a bolt-action rifle before
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:13:03 Mag fed to
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:13:13 Not even gravity fed either
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:13:54 Ahahaaahhh, it's a lot harder than that hidear
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:14:44 I don't say "It's a lot harder" without a reason
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:15:17 "*jam, jam, jam, jam, jam* COME ON DAMN I- *jam, jam, jam*"
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:15:31 Oh it will, trust me
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:39:34 Wait ser- let me guess you used alot of .9 blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:39:48 Or is it a stubby barrel?
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:40:41 Ah, the barrel's the hardest part, try doing it without using ice or .9 to get why I said that
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 03:47:29 That's not what I meant by bolt-action, but oh well
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 23:39:03 <@!298129144422858752> , Battlestar Galactica Viper much?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 00:21:09 That works because all parts in that game have some form of flight physics
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:35:43 For the contest?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 04:35:58 You may only use the listed parts
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 16:23:00 It's the way the current "grid" sort of system works, if you know anything about game design, it's basically the equivalent of jumping from 30 FPS to 60 FPS, twice the amount rendered
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 16:24:40 That wasn't the analogy being made
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 16:24:55 Basically, to add half-steps combining properly, Rick would have to double up the grid system
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:33:24 Now replicate the gun that shoots it down
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 21:32:37 *Unholsters giant starship cannon*

plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:18 Center of force isn't shown, however, you can get a rough estimate by gathering all the things applying force and determining where the center of that is
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:28 Yellow's center of mass, blue's center of lift
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:58:54 If you have engines under your craft, it'll pitch up, regardless of your wing arrangement and weight distribution
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:59:03 Well, not REGARDLESS, but it's pretty potent
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 00:59:13 I meant ones pointing forwards still

plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:44:36 It's not so much "You crashed a server oh my god!", it's just that that particular rank's a result of building something so huge and functional
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 01:45:42 DM me, even if I seem like I'm dead, I'll get to it eventually
general 2019-02-15 04:02:10 The only thing that's ever beaten me in a tank in that game is my own team digging a damn hole underneath me, or one of the wheels glitching and getting caught on nothing, before someone steals it from me, or sheer attrition (no puns) from PTRS rifles, other tanks, and RPGs, not before earning like 30 tanks worth of points via kills though

creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:21:10 .... <@!510443055111733248> , it's got the same style all around, and even I'm noticing the small details, if you took inspiration, ask trollgeinuous if you can keep it, if he says yes, you won't get ranks for it, but you won't have that thing deleted either
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:22:13 <@!510443055111733248> , even if that's different, the building style's exactly the same, down to the outer bracing style used
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:00 If you admit it, or make major enough changes that it's easily differentiable from Trollgeinuous', you'll be let off, and I want proof that you made it massively, MASSIVELY different
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:23:28 But until then, the exterior is literally the exact same as a portion of trollgeinuous' craft
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:24:01 Freaking hell, it's even got some of the side circle panels in more or less the same pattern ...
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:25:15 <@!510443055111733248> , look, I'm throwing you a god damn yacht to get out of the situation, just own up to it, whether it's inspiration or flat out copying, if the former, get Trollgeinuous' permission, if the latter, change it in ways to make it differentiable, and you'll be off the hook, either are very easy to do
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:26:11 <@!454809803223465984> , speaking of which, DO you give him permission to copy it, and if so, to what degree?

creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:33:04 ... <@!510443055111733248> , Last chance before I call rick over to delete that creation for you, and potentially ban you from both the server __**AND THE GAME**__, adjust the main body design, now
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:33:45 <@!217336009455566848> , We have a copier down here, we need you to forcably delete his creation
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:33:56 Fixed it Ace, don't worry
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:34:40 <@!510443055111733248> , Delete it, or change it, now, or else Rick will delete it for you
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:35:06 ... <@!453981329902665740> , what the hell did you do?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:35:38 ..........................
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:36:17 <@!453981329902665740> , FFS, "common sense", do you honestly think it's a good idea to DM a thing to a mod of a server that doesn't allow NSFW, something that's potentially NSFW?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:36:36 Sorry, but you've had your "One chance" like 4-5 chances ago
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:37:51 "Multiple instances of NSFW and inappropriate instances, and ruining your "last chance" many, many, MANY times over"
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:38:03 Seems like a good reason that he/she/it will get?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:38:46 <@!510443055111733248> , Don't just cut out a giant gaping hole, get rid of the main fuselage, the part that looks like Troll's craft
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:39:29 Voxel owns the server, so
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:40:12 <@!510443055111733248> , How much DID you delete though? Delete the thing that looks like trollgeinuous' craft and we'll be satisfied, because we have a ZERO tolerance for unauthorized copying
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:40:27 <@!454809803223465984> , The other guy was banned for posting NSFW multiple times and always requesting a last chance
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:41:24 ........ I have my reasons for doing so <@!263959626804887552> , don't question it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:41:44 Nino, show a screenshot of the ENTIRELY ALTERED BUILD, and we'll let troll be the final judge
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:43:44 And by the way <@!510443055111733248> , here's the thing, people will notice if you've kept the original copied creation against our orders, a lot of people in the Discord server loiter around public servers, so basically there's at least 1 per public server due to how Roblox spreads them out, and they WILL report you for having copied Troll's creation, since it's so iconic, and if we figure out you haven't adjusted your craft properly, you WILL, at minimal, have your creation deleted for not cooperating, and at most, you WILL be banned from both the game and the Discord server for being an uncreative leech upon us
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:25 ..............
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:46 Giving him the benifit of the doubt, I don't think he's english
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:44:53 Troll, do you think his "changes" were enough?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:45:25 <@511080180966752256> , Trollgeinuous is the one that owns the craft, it's up to him to say if Nino altered it enough or not
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:46:52 Fixed
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:47:17 I'd say VIP server 2
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:48:18 <@!510443055111733248> , You have 10 minutes to be there before I have to make a definite decision as to whether call Rick to ban you or not, better make a very solid case either as to why you should keep it, or adjust it in a way so it's easily distinguishable
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:48:35 Wait, you sure Troll? You're using the links Mee6 gave, right?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:00 Fixed already by the way
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:23 It's up to Voxel to do so, and I think it's because Gyazo's the easiest way to post things for some people
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:49:37 VIP server 2, as given by the Mee6 bot
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:50:15 Use the links Mee6 gives you
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:50:24 If you don't know how, follow what others do in <#384027830192832513>
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:52:53 Mee6 automatically gives the server links to people, but seriously <@!454809803223465984> !?
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:55:17 <@!217336009455566848> We need you down here now, someone's attempting  copy a person's creation while refusing to comply to alter it after he was told he was not allowed to copy it
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:55:53 The craft in question, do note that he does NOT have permission from Trollgeinuous to copy the main fuselage
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:56:25 Pictures, duh
creations-chat 2019-02-15 19:57:56 ... I'll DM him about it
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:07:57 How fast DOES that maneuver?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:09:11 It's entirely made out of control surfaces, which are supposed to give superior turn rate at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:09:40 Yeeeeup
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:10:03 They also lower structural integrity by a lot if placed incorrectly
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:10:22 Sorry <@!530774331081621504> , you weren't ranked, you're ranked now though
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:10:49 Also, notice how I arranged my control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:11:05 Is that, an actual ornithopter?
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 21:11:16 PFFFFFFFF, it looks ridiculous, I love it
plane-crazy 2019-02-15 23:56:46 Heyo
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 00:46:21 <@352928457358835715> __**AAHHHEEEEEMMMMM**__
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 00:46:29 
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 00:46:34 <@352928457358835715> , HEY!
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 00:47:00 .............. I'm leaving it to you Robo, if it is inappropriate, the blame's on you
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:05:48 Starfighter?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:06:27 __***FINA-FUCKING-LY, SOMETHING ORIGINAL AND SCIFI-ISH***__
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:06:51 I know, but there's hardly any of it, everyone just replicates stuff already done
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:07:02 I dealt with him as best as I could Integex, it's up to Rick's power now to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:08:23 Makes mine look like an interceptor then, although it's not
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:08:57 Which one, mine or Far's?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:09:21 Pretty much can't remove a single thing without sacrificing some part of it's maneuverability
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:09:50 And considering only one person to date has matched my maneuverability with a fighter over 100 blocks, I'd say it's worth keeping it that way
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:09:56 
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:11:09 Honestly, I make everything highly functionable, if it's just a showcase, then what's the point of it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:11:41 Meh, fine
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:12:58 Either like a bulb, hemisphere, or a cone
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:20:23 Huh, well alright
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:20:45 Actually I just realized, that thing looks like a freaking No Man's Sky ship
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 02:36:20 <@!324607962079297536> , Robo
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:08:30 Right, let me deal with this ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:08:36 Or, not
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:09:00 And IMMEDIATELY back, you two, just back off and let me deal with this ...........
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:09:14 Sometimes you don't need a freaking shotgun to a guy's face
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:09:58 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:10:41 .............................
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:10:42 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:10:45 Right
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:10:52 .........................
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:11:08 I'm not touching that, Voxel will fucking shout at me
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:01 ............. Right right right
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:07 <@!456350652675653645> , Reading back the chat
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:10 Let me get this straight
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:28 Because of someone's comment, that's entirely unrelated, considering this is the Roblox community we're talking about
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:37 You went on a fucking temper tantrum against the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:15:42 Is that right <@!456350652675653645> ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:16:12 .................................................................................
creations-chat 2019-02-16 03:17:21 Uhhh
creations-chat 2019-02-16 03:17:38 Apologies <@450279541139701781> , but I have to ask you to leave due to Discord Terms of Service until you're at the age of 13 with parental permission
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:19:15 Dary actually left on his own accord, this is why asking nicely works
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:19:25 I notified him, he agreed and left
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:19:58 Look, if they leave without complaining, I d- ORANGE, I SAID LEAVE IT TO ME
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:20:08 .....
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:20:09 For
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:20:10 Fuck's
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:20:11 Sake
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:20:23 Every single one of you back off, Dogie, ignore them and bring it to DMs
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:25:30 Dalek
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:26:10 Right, I've talked to Dogie about stuff, if he lashes out again, I'm not helping out anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:33:39 .... <@!456350652675653645> , you are NOT the first, by far
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 03:33:51 The thing is, inventor's an extraordinarily special rank
help 2019-02-16 03:34:57 Rick's the only one with any power aside from Madattak, because Mad dislikes in-game moderation
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:27:08 .........
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:27:12 <@!456350652675653645> , I tried to help
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:27:18 You know what I'll take it in my own hands
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:28:16 I even tried to be nice and help that fucker, he didn't listen apparently
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:31:11 What do you need help with Stridel?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:31:34 .... <@!368630214747619340> , What do you need help with?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:32:29 ..... Hold on a moment then, I'm on my way
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:32:50 What account Stridel?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 04:33:07 <@!368630214747619340> , what account?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:25:45 For the love of fuck, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:25:58 Set it so people can join
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:44:30 I set the guy up for banning to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:44:38 He's, __**EXCESSIVELY**__ toxic
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:44:54 <@!442848465857544193> , is that seriously your account name!?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:45:20 Ops, you lost the title (Don't worry, just joking)
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:45:48 Hey, it was just a joke!
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:46:12 Shin, why are you friends with him exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:48:13 Blacklist them and request them to not occupy your plot, done
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:48:36 <@!434989303882579981> , he had the mother of all temper tantrums at me, complete with life threats and everything
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 05:48:41 Keep away from him please
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 06:48:22 He is
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 06:57:14 <@!511080180966752256>
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 07:54:43 That's why I asked Rick in a priority message to get rid of him ASAP
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 07:57:05 What he's doing is he's "friending" people to use as shields
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 07:09:55 Wat?
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 07:11:34 Ah, cool
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 15:00:10 Crafts tend to be referred to as "She", or at least, that's true with ships, I think that's true with aircrafts as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 15:01:02 Not enough torque? Too much friction on the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-02-17 23:02:37 Shhhhh, sssshhhhhhhhhhh, nobody sees that, just ignore it
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 00:47:13 .................
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 00:47:31 I see nothing, get rid of it before I see something, got it?
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:47:44 Kip ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 00:48:07 <@!216371990959882241> , you're about to make a warning if you don't get rid of your statement ........ you probably know which one I'm talking about
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:48:18 <@296280922771292170> , get rid of it
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 00:48:26 Thank you, now then

plane-crazy 2019-02-18 00:53:07 Done
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:53:40 I'm gonna guess Empire?
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:54:05 You got warned for the word in the video thumbnail
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:54:29 Enough talk of that before I cut it off (Metaphorically)
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:55:02 ............... Kip, we've tried warning each and every single one that pops up, and I did a channel-wide search, the last one before you was warned for it
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:56:04 ........
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:56:16 I am, not in the mood for this, let's just start the rule now then, alright?
the-dump 2019-02-18 00:56:38 ...... __**NEXT ONE THAT DOES IT GETS A WARN, GOT IT!?**__
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 01:03:18 ......
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 01:03:39 Did, any of you read the rules, or are you just joking?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 01:04:16 Then read em again, because you nearly broke one
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:02:17 Shhhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:02:23 Nobody say anything
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:02:28 Well, react as if I'm a mod

plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:10:39 Rick's far more active at moderation anyways
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:10:50 Multi, there is slowmode, just via bot, so it doesn't show, but it automatically deletes messages
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:11:11 Got it https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/547177599714066432/Capture.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:13:12 .... Guys
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:13:19 Don't ping madattak, next one gets a warn, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 22:13:35 He's NOT ACTIVE on Plane Crazy, he's got Innovation crap to work on
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 23:25:06 ... Is that your own VIP server?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 23:25:20 <@!456238251204935690> , is that your own VIP server?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 23:26:25 Seems to be
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:06:51 Fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:07:25 Shouldn't it be obvious? It's still on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:08:45 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:08:48 Stop it, now
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 03:09:05 No inappropriate creations, whether in or out of VIP servers, period
general 2019-02-19 15:48:18 <@456226577798135808> .....
general 2019-02-19 15:49:22 Seems like you didn't learn from last time, here's the thing, we don't become mods without a reason, yes some of us are more extreme than others, but we still don't become mods without some very good reason, doubly, even triply so if we have some flaw we need to counteract
general 2019-02-19 15:50:41 Now then, rule 1 doesn't say swears aren't a thing, but rather they're not allowed to harass others, not to mention it's a highly flexible and nebulous rule, with a lot of factors dependent, it may seem like complete random chance to someone who's not paying attention, but maybe if you tried something other than harassing people, you'd take a hint
general 2019-02-19 15:52:41 And those are both legitimate separate reasons by the way, if anyone's curious I'm willing to post them here
general 2019-02-19 15:52:59 And he's lucky I didn't whack him a third time for an unconsolidated reason
general 2019-02-19 15:53:57 Yes, even when I've got all the excuses in the world to maul and kick/ban someone being toxic towards me, I'll consolidate reasons so you get off with fewer warns, especially if you have a good track record
general 2019-02-19 15:55:12 Ehhh, can you not with that particular one? It's not breaking any of the rules, just, a bit creepy for me I guess
general 2019-02-19 15:55:40 Thanks
creations-chat 2019-02-19 16:16:39 It's next to impossible to NOT copy with micro builds like that, I've tried
creations-chat 2019-02-19 16:24:47 I think they're gone, sorry
creations-chat 2019-02-19 16:38:43 It needs to maneuver in 2 of the 3 axis to be counted as a plane, meaning pitch, yaw or roll, 2/4

plane-crazy 2019-02-19 19:52:25 He's out for 2 days to give him some time to cool down ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 19:59:17 <@!242650210583576576> , He was previously kicked for being a nuance to the server, see picture below https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505164363745853441/547424661605056513/Screenshot_2019-02-19-14-29-18.png
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 19:59:50 Followed promptly by repeatedly making various statements against me in what can only be described as a temper tantrum, see another picture below https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505164363745853441/547465746007982081/Screenshot_2019-02-19-17-12-061.png
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:00:56 Needless to say, 1: Today was the worst day he could've had that tantrum, 2: He needlessly directed it straight at me, even though he himself completely broke the rules
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:01:38 I saw, thank you for notifying me Eisotro
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:02:16 Excuse me while I just extend his ban sentence for spreading literal bullshit about me among other servers in order to make me look bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:03:20 ?ban <@!301706235625865219> 7d Spreading actual false statements about a mod in other servers in sheer spite of being banned in order to cool down, after harassing a mod about a multitude of warns, followed by a kick, for breaking a rule repeatedly in the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:03:24 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:04:22 7 days
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:05:01 Congrats Kat, ~~win a race for us!~~ drive safe
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 20:11:47 Battleship, you can adjust Rythm's volume independently of other things
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:04:09 Those were removed with the new ranks update
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:08:50 Let me see
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:09:23 Done
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 01:01:23 <@456226577798135808> , Welcome back, glad to see you're old enough to use Discord properly now, enjoy your stay on the server, and thank you for cooperating in the past
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 01:02:12 Ah, well, sorry about that
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:14:22 He's suppose to be, I mentioned it to Rick
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 00:18:06 .....
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:48:44 I can't take a health break for a single week without this happening, and I'm sick of it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:49:00 Can you guys seriously cut it out and quit blowing up the server every 2 seconds?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:50:24 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:50:49 ....

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:51:00 **NOW**
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 03:56:03 Just for 2 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 04:11:31 ... What's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 04:11:48 Leave it to me
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 04:12:00 Welp, nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 04:12:24 When they leave on their own accord, they tend to legitimately come back when they're legitimately 13 or over
the-dump 2019-02-22 05:24:45 .... <@224331596906364928> , take a guess WHY it was deleted
the-dump 2019-02-22 05:24:57 Infact, please go back to the rules before posting anything else
the-dump 2019-02-22 05:25:19 While almost anything can be dumped here, anything that breaks the rules isn't allowed, for what should be absurdly obvious reasons
the-dump 2019-02-22 05:25:25 Take a guess why it's jinxed to hell
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:55:56 ... <@!325320982602448897>
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:25:45 .....
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:25:59 Don't try it again
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:26:18 Do you realize what kind of riots and lynchings happen when people do it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:26:48 I've literally seen one go on for a week before people finally dropped it, and that was half this server's size
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:26:53 Don't try it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:27:11 Still don't try it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:29:14 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:29:23 Next one to do it gets a warn branded on their face, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:29:53 Don't try to ping everyone
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:30:13 Again, don't try it
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 20:21:59 Oh holy crap, congrats Rick!

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:10:11 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:10:14 Cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:10:41 I literally can't go an entire day without something in the server breaking ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 05:13:31 Disable autosave, force it to save an empty slot
general 2019-02-23 05:51:12 What have I been doing I hear you ask? Well
general 2019-02-23 05:52:40 I may be helping to develop some games

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 23:14:57 You'd better not
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 23:15:22 I'm sorry, we literally JUST banned a person for posting a highly NSFW meme in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 23:15:33 So, I'm a bit, touchy, about that stuff
the-dump 2019-02-23 23:15:48 Do I even need to say it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 23:17:21 Look, I'm sorry about that, it's just, if it's inappropriate I will straight up smash you into a crater and leave your corpse there, but if it's a joking one that's not actually inappropriate such as standing on a chair in an office space, that's fine, so long as it abides by the rules
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 23:18:20 I banned someone for posting inappropriate stuff in <#495286269459300364> , reaching their 3 warns quota and having been previously booted for similar reasons before
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 03:01:54 It's not his/her's, so
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 03:01:58 Look closely at who's in it
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 03:02:29 We can't do anything to them unless Rick decides he wants to, or they're in the server
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 03:02:50 Otherwise worst you can do is act big and pretend like you're marking them down or something
help 2019-02-24 03:28:11 Excessive lag
help 2019-02-24 03:28:23 I shouldn't really need to say that to be honest, yet here we are
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 18:22:22 I've suggested that multiple times, there's likely a reason Rick hasn't added it yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 01:37:31 <#497142796961054721> , infact, <#495286269459300364> with this if you don't mind
creations-chat 2019-02-25 02:18:06 -CoughWyverncough- Yeah, always add some form of reverse to your crafts, that way you don't faceplant into someone and become unable to take off
creations-chat 2019-02-25 02:18:49 Are you copying my Wyvern!? (On a serious note though, good job with that)
creations-chat 2019-02-25 02:21:27 Meh, alright, it's just that the Wyvern I have is very similar to your craft in terms of performance, minus the reverse thrust, which I'm assuming you're going to add very soon
general 2019-02-25 02:38:52 <@!332615504315416586> , what if I didn't download Discord?
general 2019-02-25 02:41:23 I'm clear
general 2019-02-25 02:42:27 Please tell me this is a joke of some sort
general 2019-02-25 02:43:02 Alright, I'm raising some red flags with all I know then, thanks for sharing the info
general 2019-02-25 02:43:18 ? ban (Don't worry this is a joke)
general 2019-02-25 02:43:25 But seriously, thanks for bringing this up
general 2019-02-25 02:53:45 As far as I can tell, if you use the web browser, you're in the clear
general 2019-02-25 02:55:20 But to see it, it's "C:\Users\\(Insert your computer username, not Discord or Roblox username here, the one that you get a start screen for?)\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache"
general 2019-02-25 02:58:22 If you don't see "discord" after you reach the Roaming folder, you're probably in the clear
general 2019-02-25 03:01:05 __**EVERY IMAGE, EVEN DELETED ONES**__ Linh, that means someone could sneak an illegal image onto the server, get caught by a bot, and it'd linger around on your computer
general 2019-02-25 03:02:46 Linh, you know what we mean!
general 2019-02-25 03:07:01 Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold up, Spy, care to explain what just happened in the midst of this?
general 2019-02-25 03:08:38 I would suggest simply swapping to browser for a while, at least until they directly address this
creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:15:45 Done didly doneified
general 2019-02-25 03:18:18 Everyone should have it, so no, did you capitalize correctly?
general 2019-02-25 03:18:47 C:\Users\(Insert your computer username, not Discord or Roblox username here, the one that you get a start screen for?)\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache
general 2019-02-25 03:19:25 If you use the web browser version, you're fine, but if you downloaded it, well raise the red flags
creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:21:57 It's an old rank that didn't make the reform
creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:22:09 Basically, drop 5 "bombs" of any sort onto people, they must hit
creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:22:23 If you've got a really stonking massive bomb instead, that counts to
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:22:34 Check if any parts are out of bounds
general 2019-02-25 03:23:05 Mac?
general 2019-02-25 03:23:21 I have no idea then
general 2019-02-25 03:23:51 Refer to this
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:24:04 Probably a glitch, save and reload?
general 2019-02-25 03:24:27 __**I MENTIONED TO CHECK HIDDEN ITEMS DIDN'T I!?**__ But seriously, glad you found it
general 2019-02-25 03:25:05 Change them to .PFP I think
general 2019-02-25 03:25:49 Be careful though, this includes **DELETED IMAGES** as well, so even those caught by the bot as inappropriate might slip through, when we refer to "Every image" we mean "EVERY IMAGE", that's literally the cache of every single image
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:26:10 Keken, if I had to take a wild guess, center of lift (blue) is too far back compared to center of mass (yellow/orange)
general 2019-02-25 03:27:03 That one I'm slightly clueless about, I'll get to you in a brief moment
general 2019-02-25 03:27:40 Try "Open with", and then use some sort of image viewer?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:29:12 More wings at the front, weight at the back
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:30:14 Yeah, don't forget to adjust ballast weight
general 2019-02-25 03:30:41 Rightclick on a file I think, I'm not sure, I'm about as clueless as you are on that particular point
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:31:51 Yeup, always check your center of mass vs center of lift
general 2019-02-25 03:36:19 CTRL+A I think will work
general 2019-02-25 03:36:26 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:44:46 <@275336226674966528> , A rank that's in <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:45:00 That's mostly to prove that you actually put effort into Plane Crazy and want to see it's positive growth
general 2019-02-25 03:45:15 I'd suggest being very careful
general 2019-02-25 03:45:27 A friend sent me this https://i.gyazo.com/077afc6372697f7ab1ab7866ccbd9492.png
general 2019-02-25 03:45:37 See something funny in the upper part of it?
general 2019-02-25 03:45:52 A particular red/blue/gold/white Asteria?
general 2019-02-25 03:46:04 I sent him the picture for testing this out
general 2019-02-25 03:46:41 It's not just profile pictures, it's literally every single image sent
general 2019-02-25 03:46:46 Dunno, are you in a bird server?
general 2019-02-25 03:47:17 He likes birds, what can I say?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:48:10 Seems tail heavy
general 2019-02-25 03:48:23 Yeup, you've stumbled onto Discord saving stuff on your computer
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:48:40 Ballasts at the head?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:49:01 Did you try balancing out the engines?
general 2019-02-25 03:49:25 You will crash, hard
general 2019-02-25 03:49:33 .... <@!241930354217320458> why!?
general 2019-02-25 03:49:52 Tis fine, just don't do it again
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:50:55 Rocket engines are freaking heavy as hell
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:51:59 ~~Madjik~~ A LOT of time, effort, thought and ingenuity
general 2019-02-25 03:52:13 Again, that's every image that you ever received battleship
general 2019-02-25 03:52:18 That includes deleted ones

creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:53:42 If so, please upvote the most recent one, even if it's buried underneath a billion other ones, Rick checks every unique one (Believe me, he has)

creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:58:05 Mind if I clear this up?
creations-chat 2019-02-25 03:59:16 Done
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 03:59:40 No idea, maybe you have a lot of momentum? An imbalance of rockets?

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 04:30:15 <@!334232774502514689> , others reported the other way around, the snow caused their computer to explode (not literally)
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 18:18:53 Ghost pinging
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 21:34:33 It's ultimately up to Rick or Madattak to do so, since Mad's seriously against in-game moderation (Don't bug him about this)
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 22:48:03 <@!495698891317051412> <@218825012981792769> , both of you cut it out now
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:16:09 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:16:52 I'm making an executive decision here, each person that speaks off topic that doesn't move to <#497142796961054721> gets a 5 minute mute, increasing in a 5 minute increment until I hit 30 minutes, then I'm incrementing it by 10 minutes, got it!?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:17:25 Okay seriously Under, that joke's actually irritating now, can you please cut it out?

plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:25:49 ... <@!495698891317051412> , quit being excessively rude to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:26:03 Seriously, don't need to say it like that to get the point across
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:26:23 At the very least don't do the freaking name calling, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:27:26 It's Roblox physics, he literally tried everything to bandage the problem, no dice
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:28:15 They quite literally broke WASD for any actual vehicle controls for a brief moment
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:28:29 So blame them, not us
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:43:53 Fuuuckiiiing scambots ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:44:04 
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:44:11 They posted that, then went entirely radio silent
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:44:31 It's tall, I'll give you that
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:11 If anyone knows that person and can legitimately vouch for them, you're fully allowed to do so to me, but otherwise I'm considering them a scambot, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:19 I'm referring to the one I just banned by the way
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:45:58 Can you climb up it is the question?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:48:05 I'm pretty sure my Wyvern can be converted to a relatively easy transport for that tower
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:49:17 For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, and if that reaction's against an immovable object, you might find breakages
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:53:55 ...... <@!362351190618538005>
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:54:22 Do I seriously need to warn you for that?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:55:48 Try that again and see what the hell happens, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:56:04 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:56:06 Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:56:09 Care to repeat that?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:56:26 For your own safety, go back and read the rules ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:57:00 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:59:24 TLDR He tried to turn Orange's mega tower into a euphemism, so I warned him for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 23:59:48 This is why I need autonomous "Facebreaking" power, although Rick and Voxel are a bit scared of it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:00:32 .... What the actual fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:00:54 Orange, I'm, gonna let you handle that, if he starts pi- ..........
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:01:05 <@456226577798135808> , I said I was sick of those jokes, can you cut it out!?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:01:47 Scatter weapons tend to be deadly in Plane Crazy, especially against smaller targets
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:02:00 But against larger or better armored targets, they're pretty bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:02:19 Against something that's __**BOTH**__, well now you're screwed
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:05:46 Do note: This decreases focused firepower by __**ALOT**__, so be careful of armored targets
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:06:15 I've actually had scatter rockets used against me, it's ineffective
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:06:50 They're good as either a focus fire or as a deterrent
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:08:32 Rotors are unprotected, one shot and it's dead
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:08:50 That means that the best way to beat it is to go high and just plain charge at it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:09:04 He's got them on motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:09:42 I dare you to try dodging my Wyvern, to date, only one person has made a creation that can match it's performance
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:10:08 I'm not counting copies Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:10:32 RoboRail actually managed to build a plane that was literally on-par with it's speed, maneuverability, durability (in design) and so on
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:11:18 That'd cause alot of chip damage, not alot of actual serious damage
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:12:45 Yes, I did give him full permission to copy my Wyvern by the way
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:13:12 Nope, only the most trusted can, hell, many in the administrative/moderation team aren't allowed to copy
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:14:32 Yeah, it's a bit of a high performance beast, both through gameplay and through computer requirements
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:15:30 ............. <@!269966967467802636> Emergency question, how old are you?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:15:42 Uhhh, guys, wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:15:48 FOR FUCK'S SAKE GUYS
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:16:13 <@!163143541160148992> CAN YOU AT LEAST LET ME EXPLAIN!?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:19:28 I talked to him to about it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 00:19:57 See <@!163143541160148992> ? No need to smash their faces in right off the bat

help 2019-02-26 02:35:17 Just what do you need help with exactly?
help 2019-02-26 02:36:25 I think that's more of a you problem
help 2019-02-26 02:37:20 Nobody else has had that problem, and Rick, or one of us, would've caught such a major problem earlier
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:44:01 Oh shit!
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:44:23 <@456226577798135808> Hey!
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:44:49 Nice to see you here
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:45:24 By the rules, bad words are only allowed in serious moderation, and not directed at anyone
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:46:27 So, Reverb, what brought you to Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 02:47:27 I think I was just poking around Madattak's other games to see what else he made
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:04:06 About 8 seconds for a full 360 I see
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:04:29 There's been like 50 of those
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:04:37 If you mean to-scale, you're a bit mad then
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:04:43 (Mad as in insane)
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:04:50 Like, do you realize how large that'd be?
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:05:57 It was about a 180, and I started counting the moment you started pulling up
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:06:16 360/180=2, so multiply the time it took to do that turn by 2, 4X2=8
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:07:22 I mean, to make a larger craft equally as maneuverable, that takes a surprising amount of effort
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:07:50 Tiny planes are far more maneuverable than larger planes, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:08:04 Seriously, they're a pain in the rear to try to fight, I've tried
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:08:25 True
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:10:11 ....... I don't beat people unless they deserve it
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:12:06 Simple solution: Break Rythm by leaving the server and letting it die out, then bring it back in
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:12:20 Like that, then in theory it'll die out on it's own
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:12:39 ............ Or, try to do it manually, that "works" to I guess
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:17:12 You can simply check <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-02-26 03:18:25 In the designer category ...

general 2019-02-27 00:23:17 We literally legally can not allow people under 13 years of age to be in this server, so

general 2019-02-27 00:25:41 .............

general 2019-02-27 00:37:20 <@!249006275378020353> , This is off topic, I believe you mean a dump channel, we've literally got one
general 2019-02-27 00:38:47 You're allowed to use this channel for off topic things, but memes and random junk go in the dump, anything related to the actual game would preferably go to general

general 2019-02-27 00:48:38 Anything not related to Plane Crazy that's not just a random meme
general 2019-02-27 00:56:29 ...........
general 2019-02-27 00:56:38 I know what he posted, it wasn't his build, he was just reporting upon it
general 2019-02-27 01:01:56 ..............
general 2019-02-27 01:01:59 You know what
general 2019-02-27 01:02:03 Do you, honestly know what?
general 2019-02-27 01:02:18 I'm not dealing with this, I'm way, way too fucking pissed at life to be dealing with shit from <@!249006275378020353>
general 2019-02-27 01:02:55 Oh look, 3 warns, get the fuck out
general 2019-02-27 01:03:38 "Trying to start a fight, frame a member and generally being a complete and total nuisance to the server as a whole, all lumped together"
general 2019-02-27 01:03:45 That's the last reason ...
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:03:57 TLDR someone was being really toxic and posted NSFW stuff repeatedly
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:04:09 It's not a description that does him justice, but it's close enough
general 2019-02-27 01:04:31 Does ANY OTHER FUCKER wanna try me, or would you rather keep calm today? Because I'm not having any of it today
general 2019-02-27 01:05:49 What is it?
general 2019-02-27 01:06:16 ..... If it's not a meme and follows the rules, you're allowed, since it's technically off-topic
general 2019-02-27 01:06:26 If it's a soundcloud of Plane Crazy, feel free to do <#384021699466756107>
general 2019-02-27 01:06:36 Videos fall under the same category, if they're not meme-worthy, they're fine
general 2019-02-27 01:06:53 Prime example: "Oh shit look at this!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utGummqR9B0
general 2019-02-27 01:07:20 Don't worry, I talked to a few experts on it, nobody will come knocking on your door because someone sent you NSFW stuff
general 2019-02-27 01:07:21 ...........
general 2019-02-27 01:07:40 <@!350241258012278784> , you're pushing it, but I guess I'll allow that

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:26:52 <@!303624155687813121> , if by bigger saves you mean more data, that's Roblox's side, not ours
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 01:27:04 We literally can not expand the data storage, because that's the hard limit Roblox imposed on it

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:36:23 And I have something even bigger
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:36:48 Yeah, that was the King Dragon, I dare you to fit the Asteria on
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:36:59 This one?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:37:12 ?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:37:21 No anchor blocks by the way, that's cheaty
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:37:30 ***CHALLENGE ACCEPTED, MEET IN VIP SERVER 1***
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:38:20 Also, this picture?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:38:49 The Wyrm, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:39:10 Dude, I've sunk specialized carriers DESIGNED to fit maximal weight
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:39:21 And even then he was going to sink eventually
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:46:04 It's huge creations, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:49:06 I'm sensing anchors on Yielding's craft, it didn't budge no matter what I did to it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:49:17 Hell, I bellyflopped HARD on it and it didn't budge
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:49:33 Not to mention the front seemed to snap with the King Dragon on it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:49:49 It's suspicion currently, but I'm not sure IF he actually has anchors or not, seems like it though
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:50:05 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:50:34 But seriously Yielding, I flopped so hard on you, with every other carrier, if I did that, I would've plunged their nose into the water
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:50:47 And that's with the King Dragon, about 300, 400 parts less
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:51:20 Ehhhhh, I don't know, I GUESS I'll take your word, but you won't be crowned "The one to hold the Asteria", I couldn't see anything being nudged around, even during the final bellyflop
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:52:02 I could see the mechanism inside, it was a natural tilt I think
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:52:31 Either way, probably too laggy to confirm anyways, I couldn't see any change in buoyancy
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:52:42 And I did check by block lines
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:52:51 It didn't sink at all, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:53:14 Yeah no I'd rather have people be actually ABLE to play in VIP 1 for a while
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:53:52 Quit posting people's faces, if it's a meme, nobody gets it, and it could be very uncomfortable for some people
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:54:04 I'm shocked that it doesn't flip
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:55:37 Hey! That's how I make these things fucking nigh immortal!
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:55:42 As shown by that
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:56:13 Okay seriously how Yielding? I'm willing to bet lag
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:56:19 Like seriously, that's just absurd
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:56:51 Imperial literally had helium, super rockets, the entire works, all to support the King Dragon, and you're saying you're able to not even sneeze at a bellyflopping Asteria!?
the-dump 2019-02-28 04:57:51 Just, don't, I'm deleting them for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:58:05 Alright, well, uhhh, hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:58:14 That's impressive, but, ehhhh, I can't call it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:58:25 Nah, don't bother
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 04:58:45 I'll let my computer cool down for a day, then tomorrow I'll bellyflop on your carrier again
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:01:09 It's not the small stuff that sinks you, it's the big stuff
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:01:19 I know Imperial can attest to that
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:18 I'd say under 100 is tiny
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:26 200-400 is small
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:38 400-800 is medium
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:45 800-1100 is large
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:02:55 1100-1500 is crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:03:06 1500-5000 is simply spine breaking
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:03:16 Anything further's probably server crashing
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:03:36 *Challenge acce-* Fuck it, I'm too tired
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:03:48 If you really want to, we can duel gamer, but otherwise I'd like my computer to cool down
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:05:37 Gamer, 12 guns, optionally 12 rockets, arranged in a simultaneously narrow/wide frontal focused pattern, with an extreme amount of armoring, maneuverability and speed, as well as reverse thrust
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:05:46 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:06:05 4.1 seconds in order to do a full 360
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:06:51 Just, whatever, I'll shout at you if it's not good
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:07:48 Weakpoints: 
Tail, chop that off and it's center of lift suddenly shifts and causes it's pitch to destabilize
Cockpit: Only a wedge of glass is protecting the head from being shot up
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:07:59 Although big plus on the very narrow profile
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:08:25 As you can see with my craft, biggest weakpoint of it is it's target profile is god damn huge on the top/bottom
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:10:00 Aren't 1X1 drives far less effective than any other size of drive?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:10:54 Denied, it's really creepy
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:11:03 Like seriously, even I got shivers from that, and I've seen lots of shit
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:11:19 Imperial, magnet drive maneuvering
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:15:13 I don't need ballast to sink Yielding
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:15:41 What is it with you and posting selfies of black people or seriously obese white people!?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:16:43 Just because the rules say you can doesn't mean it isn't highly frowned upon ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:18:14 .............................................. No offense but I'm genuinely getting sick of you and your general attitude, you seem to be treating this server like a "Post all the actual shit" server
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:03 .......
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:06 ?warnings <@377596437283995660>
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:11 You're one to talk ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:21:28 Because it was inappropriate
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:23:34 Ravin, I don't give two damns if it's borderline or straight up inappropriate, I'm going to treat it as inappropriate, because people kept on fucking posting borderline shit until the entire server revolted against him
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:23:51 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:23:57 <@456226577798135808> , Wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:24:04 1's expired, another's about to expire
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 05:25:04 ......... I'll let Imperial decide, my decision would've been: "Keep him, but literally 1 sneeze and he's gone"
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:25:29 ............. Guys, just cut it out
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:26:26 I am not in the mood for this for fuck's sake, and I'm very tired of uuyy posting random black people picture as if he was making a god damn hitlist or something, now can you please just cut it out? Posting random pictures without any purpose whatsoever is basically spam
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:27:39 If you just spammed it randomly, yes, but if you actually gave it SOME form of purpose, no
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:28:01 uuyy was literally just posting random selfies without any **PURPOSE** whatsoever, other than just for posting them
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:05 Spam: The massive overabundance of some form of information, with little actual use or reason behind it
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:13 And yeah, THOSE are fine, they're meant to be funny
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:29:20 How the fuck is a face funny though?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:30:41 It has to have SOME purpose
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:20 Let me ask you this: Does a random face of some random guy we've never seen before, not doing anything, have any purpose?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:49 Hell, imagine a mugshot or a photo ID, without everything else, a blank or uninteresting background, what purpose does it serve?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:51 ...............
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:31:57 <@!350241258012278784> , how?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:32:10 Legitimately, how? Do you find the Mona Lisa funny then?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:33:19 There was a good example of a funny face picture earlier, although I'm not gonna bother to find it, TL;DR on it though, basically it was someone mocking up a beach selfie, and a picture of what he was doing taken by someone else
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:33:23 .... Nope
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:35:47 Uhhhh, <@!350773590213525511> , Delete that if you don't mind
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:35:58 I know it's from the Madagascar movie thing, but, uhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:36:10 Ehhhh, I'll give you a very soft pass
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:36:38 It was nudging rule 2, sorry
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:07 Look, things are freaking complicated, you try managing this for more than 10 minutes and see how it goes
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:12 Also, why <@459620345536577547> ?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:26 It wasn't NSFW, but it was pushing it
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:37:52 I got it curly, and while it wasn't quite breaking rule 2, I'd rather be better safe than sorry
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:38:43 You can
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:38:55 And <@377596437283995660> , We're handcuffed by both Discord and Roblox at the same time
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:13 ...... -Facedesk- please don't wofd, I'm dissapointed in that part of the community
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:32 And if someone on Roblox decides to bug us about this server, we're going to have to shut the entire thing down
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:39:58 <@!350241258012278784> , no, but unless it has a purpose, which, Imperial saved you from that, I'm gonna count it as spam
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:40:18 The only problem I have is the coloration and tail <@459620345536577547> , otherwise, meh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:40:37 <@377596437283995660> , there are PLENTY of euphemisms in old movies that are rated PG, sooo
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:41:13 .... <@377596437283995660> , don't blame us
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:42:38 .........
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:42:48 <@!350241258012278784> , Did you pay attention to what I typed out?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:07 I literally just said "<@377596437283995660> , there are PLENTY of euphemisms in old movies that are rated PG, sooo" (Sorry for the ping Ravin)
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:51 Okay I'm taking a temporary health break
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:43:56 Uhhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:03 <@!350773590213525511> Please tell me that's not what I think it is
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:35 Oh holy f-
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:39 They actually are, holy shit
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:44:45 Or, wait
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:45:10 Yeah no, you can tell by the "posture" and 2nd row from left, closest to camera
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:45:29 That looks like it's from Sky Rogue or something
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:07 Pretty sure Imperial's joking, judging from the typing and capitalization pattern
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:37 Don't quote me on this, but if he was serious, he'd type seriously, and not bolden anything like that
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:42 Uhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:49 Wofd, I'm gonna, uhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:46:57 Yeaaaahhhhhh
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:48:05 Okay, I'm gonna leave it to you Imperial, also <@!350773590213525511> , both would've been fine with context, hell, they might even be fine in <#384021699466756107> at the right time, did you SEE what just happened there?
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:48:59 TL;DR, people spammed out various memes that could reference a sort of "I saw that!", and then memes of banning stuff
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:49:15 It did actually match the context, so it was allowed
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:49:33 I mean, that's why crab rave plays every time we ban someone
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:50:53 I'm leaving you with this Imperial, I need a bit of a mental health time
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:52:00 .... <@!350241258012278784> , Justify the context
the-dump 2019-02-28 05:52:41 ........... Imperial, you take over then, but seriously, it's literally fucking up my nerves at this point
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:22:29 Asteria reporting for duty
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:22:38 King Dragon as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:22:46 And a few Wyverns
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:22:58 Maybe a Goliath or two as corvette style escorts
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:23:29 Oh hey, some Stiletto interceptors
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:25:30 You do realize Imperial that you have a written permit to bypass the copyright for anything up to the MK 3 of my fighter line, right?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:33:48 -Disables lag field, carrier instantly sinks-
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:34:03 But seriously, just 1 of each is literally at the save data limit
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:35:26 If we were to take the respective limits, for every 1 Asteria there's about 50-100 King Dragons, 200-400 Dragons, ~3000 Wyverns, 200 combat-ready Salamanders, 10 still-working Wyrms (Nostalga mostly), and 5 Stilettos (They aren't the best experiments)
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:38:10 You like Warframe don't you Farollo?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 06:40:47 ~~Rule 2!~~ Which is not a fun thing to model in Plane Crazy huh?
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:43:14 And who are you exactly?
the-dump 2019-02-28 20:48:52 .... <@251113404645900289> , Who exactly are you?
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:00:04 Okay? I can't even find ROLve ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:02:27 Oh thaaaaat one, yeah, after a run-in with alot of stuff, no offense but I don't really have respect for ROLve anymore
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:04:38 Look, after I've witnessed alot of shit, what am I supposed to say? I literally saw one collaborating with a fly hacker on Typical Colors, and I mean a particularly abusive fly hacker to ...
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:05:56 Typical Colors is one of their games, and I've seen so many things that I've stopped believing in their moderation team
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:07:06 __**Collaborating**__ with one
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:09:30 Maybe not Rytim exactly, but it was someone who was kicking anyone who questioned it
the-dump 2019-02-28 21:09:47 One reverse-lookup later, turns out they're a mod
the-dump 2019-02-28 22:14:28 Is that a caique?
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:42:31 <@456226577798135808> , I'm a fan of birds, and I freaking want a caique, they're adorable
the-dump 2019-02-28 23:57:23 Sounds pretty cool
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:13 <@251113404645900289> Oh that's very believable "ex-moderator from mano and newhaven"
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:20:46 Looking back at the chat history, I seriously doubt that you were a moderator for anything
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:22:24 Your behavior doesn't reflect it at all, again
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:24:47 Plus I can literally just do this in 10 seconds (I left the white space there intentionally because I couldn't be fucked to open photoshop, so I just used paint)
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:25:18 In the modern day era, screenshots aren't exactly that believable to be fully honest
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:25:41 I mean, it's to get the point across simply put
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:37 Because although that person was in the right as per the written rules, and even though I could've exerted rule 11 on them, I keep on trying to be nice and explain it, hence why there's so many people in the server, because even if they break rules, they don't learn if you break their faces in exchange
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:29:50 We're leaving Voxel and rick to prep it, likely they're discussing it
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:30:06 Madattak's against in-game moderation, 99% unlikely to happen
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:12 How exactly is in-game moderation, headed by a highly trusted team, inefficient?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:31:17 I put that in quotes for a damn reason ...
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:32:00 ... How, exactly, is it faster?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:16 .... Rytim, I'm going to stop you right there, that's saying you can interface it so you can externally delete someone's creation, and if they continue, ban them, while I've seen the latter take effect (Albeit while causing lag in the few games that I have played it where the dev confirmed it), the former doesn't seem fesable
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:18 ...........
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:33:31 You literally just agreed with us, but you're trying to fight with our statements
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:34:04 And how is that any different from in-game admins?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:34:28 Well, technically <#495286269459300364> 's open for anything, so, why not I guess? More convenient to condense it in one channel than to flood it over to another
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:06 Rytim, you're saying the problem's an issue with tools, that's not the problem, the problem's an issue with manpower, not enough people HAVE the tools
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:35:55 To make a metaphor on this, it doesn't matter how many guns you have, if only one person's allowed to wield them, you've still only got one soldier
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:05 ...... Rytim
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:22 Listen to what we're typing for once
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:33 Also, are you talking about people in the Discord server, or in-game?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:49 .................
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:37:32 Rytimiscurisin, you're literally repeating what I'm typing out, but claiming it as your own, and you're literally ignoring statements when I keep on saying why that's difficult, if not impossible to do
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:38:46 I saw it on Noob vs Zombie Realish, but that particular system caused not only lag problems, but was highly inconsistent
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:39:37 
help 2019-03-01 21:40:09 Disable RGB colors in the settings, overwrite older builds, use more beams than blocks
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:15 Then why don't you show us?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:41:57 Then don't claim it unless you know it well enough or have previous evidence from another person to prove it
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:43:37 As far as I can tell, it's still going because Rytim doesn't seem to understand that we're talking about the same thing, and he simply keeps on trying to needlessly push his point, while remaining blissfully ignorant as to other people's experiences and mentions of the same thing, even when they contradict or nullify his points to various degrees
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:02 Right, let me be blunt, the bottleneck, isn't, the tools, we have enough tools to detect people causing problems
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:44:40 What our bottleneck is are the actual people to respond to these problems, and no bot is trained enough to detect the difference between a plane and a flying, you know, in the current state, so we will need trusted manpower
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:45:17 ... "the bottleneck, isn't, the tools", maybe try listening for once instead of blabbing on needlessly to yourself as if you're the only one that can be correct
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:45:44 What CAN the third party system do that our current Plane Crazy Discord population can't do exactly?
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:44 Faster than instantaneous? Oh I'll "believe that", while also believing that a fucking rainbow unicorn's vomiting on my face, oh wait, that's not happening
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:46:53 I'm telling you, you're trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:28 .... That's not what I said at all, what I'm saying is we need more manpower to enforce in-game moderation better, we don't need more tools
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:47:52 Fonkl, I don't think that's possible, at least not without designing the game from the ground-up to support it in the first place
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:48:33 .................... Alright then, I suppose I'll take the advice now then
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:49:35 Here's my reason: "I think we've all had enough of your sheer ignorance to everyone's communication towards you" for 10 minutes
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:50:23 Ahehem, pay attention to the last part that's outside of the quotes
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:51:19 Here have a random bird being spray washed https://twitter.com/birbb/status/1062158605661691906
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:52:55 Random person that joined the server, who was considered "new to Discord" without a PFP even
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:53:45 More like "nO PROFILE pIC, nO USERNAME, no ServiCE"
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:54:01 Look at the username of the person I booted
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 21:54:23 I didn't boot them because they were new, I booted them because of their username
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:59:02 It's "Swiss army nails" I think
general 2019-03-01 22:13:24 <@!479723957004664842> , <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind, unless that's related to the current conversation in <#497142796961054721>
general 2019-03-01 22:14:34 <@!478669911573528580> Stop there, now
general 2019-03-01 22:14:55 <@!478669911573528580> __**IF YOU DON'T MIND PLEASE STOP THERE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY BEFORE YOU BREAK RULE 2**__
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:15:37 If it follows the rules, yes, but please be thorough with rule 2 and 11
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:16:23 Then scale up those small planes or see what makes them tick
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:20:14 <@456226577798135808> , Make sure the meme follows the rules, got it? While <#495286269459300364> 's alot more lenient than many of the other channels, we still have to enforce the rules in there
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:20:30 Yeah no I'm not allowing that (Picture's already deleted)
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:20:38 Euphemism
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:21:21 You need decent understanding of the game to do so
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:21:34 Then you can build stuff like this
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:21:41 Or Turbo's mega bi-plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:21:58 Ehhhh, it's decent, ish
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:23:03 .... Gop, we (including you) are legally required to leave Discord as a whole if you are under 13 years of age without parental permission, so please, don't linger around here if you're underage
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:23:18 <@456226577798135808> .....
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:23:25 Oh wait crap SORRY!
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:23:37 <@456226577798135808> , Cut it out, that's still borderlining on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:24:25 It's not a problem of being on or off topic, nor the candy, it's the fact that he's got nothing on, but a towel
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:24:53 Now cut, it, out, we have to be extremely thorough with rule 2, otherwise we risk getting shut down hard
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:26:32 ......... I can see the pants, and I can see he's a guy, so I'll leave you be Grab
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:26:38 <@!221496030355521536> In-game or in the server?
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:26:46 Block them
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:27:03 <#497142796961054721> if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:27:38 ...................................
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:27:44 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:28:01 I'm not gonna warn anyone, but please, go to <#497142796961054721> , I'm not in the mood for this ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:29:26 Find one yourself, or design your own, you loose creativity if you just ask for people to help
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:29:59 You have Google, right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:30:35 ........................ <@!478669911573528580> , you're lying, because you're fully capable of chatting to us
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:31:01 <@456226577798135808> , He's asking for plane ideas, and he's using the excuse of "I have no internet" to be lazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:41:53 <@!486674992981999648> , <@456226577798135808> , Both of you, cut it out, Katze's actually somewhat in the right in this argument
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:42:06 While he's one of the more sensitive people in terms of eyesight, he is still correct on that
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:42:14 So please, at least tone down the intensity of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:42:23 Ah, er, sorry about that
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 22:43:48 ............
the-dump 2019-03-01 22:44:33 Uhhhh, <@!340543153922768906> , I'm gonna delete that last one
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 23:59:28 The fuck is the tank on the right!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-01 23:59:49 It's kicks and bans actually, kicks for inappropriate usernames
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 00:00:07 Seriously though, does the right tank actually use those treads or what?
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 00:00:23 RIP, less impressive suddenly
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 00:00:28 Still a cool design though
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 00:38:33 She posted a reminder of rule 2
plane-crazy 2019-03-02 00:41:44 Leave it to me
help 2019-03-02 01:27:23 It saves quite a bit of space on colored creations, but remember, they will default to a pre-set Roblox color palette, which means their color could be vastly different compared to before
general 2019-03-02 02:04:00 Ahem
general 2019-03-02 02:04:28 Whaaat? It sells the point
general 2019-03-02 02:05:28 .... <@!350241258012278784> , I already said why it wasn't working, so can you please wait until it updates rather than fucking ignoring me!? Thank you
<@!264769733021270016> Naaaahhhhhh
general 2019-03-02 02:06:16 It's updating, only those with the particular refreshed link can access the server ...
the-dump 2019-03-02 13:07:49 It's opportunity, not curiosity ya dumdum
the-dump 2019-03-02 13:08:26 ........ 1: I was trying to joke if you couldn't tell by "dumdum"
2: You don't need to be excessively rude like that
creations-chat 2019-03-03 00:26:47 I mean, it's unique, so
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 04:59:57 That's what the upper gun limit's for
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:00:44 Not to mention, gun spam on tiny vehicles is ineffective, as any amount of firepower will down it
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:37:13 They'd be slightly off-center is the issue, which can cause problems
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:37:37 Which server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:38:22 In a moment, let me just land on his thing
creations-chat 2019-03-04 01:41:06 Already done
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:47:38 Turns out landing gear nerfs sinking power
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:47:49 So now suddenly everything can hold my crafts
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:48:39 That was pre-landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:48:52 Sink sank sunk
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:55:48 Rockets impact the water
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:55:59 That's why you don't see any torpedo ships using them
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:56:24 It'd be pretty awesome, but at the same time, blame Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:57:07 Yielding, turns out landing gear makes every carrier able to hold anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:57:23 Post-update, they're stupidly bouncy, to the point where carriers don't even budge
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:57:38 Ehhhh, it'd be incredibly difficult to take off then, as this is actually freaking heavy
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:57:46 OY! I NEVER USE BALLAST BEAMS, NOR DO I EVER USE HELIUM
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:57:59 
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:58:04 
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:58:54 Ehhhhh, I'm not sure, the lag's excessive
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 01:59:09 I might, but I need to let Roblox cool down again, it was NOT happy with me landing on you
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 02:01:02 That's actually simple
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 02:01:44 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 02:02:01 I'm gonna let Roblox refresh a day, I tried 2 in a row last time and nearly crashed my computer
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:33:11 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:33:38 Inappropriate joke to you know ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:33:52 Wait, who?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:34:13 Oh, ban evasion
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:34:51 He admitted to being someone who was previously banned
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:42:09 ~~more like my dead hole~~ He was banned once, got on an alt, and now he's on another one, sounds like bullshit to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:42:43 FYI, by "dead hole" I mean I'm really tired of everything, and it's okay
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:43:09 Computer's still borked for a while
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:43:51 Again, he was banned once, joined back on an alt to get another banhammer to the face, and now this is his third alt
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:43:55 Er, second? Dunno
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:48:46 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:49:19 Where have I heard this before? Fine, but tell him my patience is next to zero at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 03:50:02 Knowing him he's probably gonna go full blown crybaby mode the moment I start talking, but whatever, just toss it to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:54:39 <@!548514581455175680> #5867 Cut it out, this isn't <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:54:57 Sorry for being late, I literally just woke up to this going on
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:55:08 .............
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:55:18 <@!548514581455175680> I said, CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:55:36 This isn't <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:56:20 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:57:12 Just shut it already Zenox, you're being seriously, seriously annoying
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:57:18 Also how the heck dustin?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:57:45 Not bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 15:58:19 ..... This belongs in <#495286269459300364> , so move there, now
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:00:20 First working aircraft, no wedges, boring 1X2 deltas, although it was extremely durable
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:00:49 Yes, even with my very first craft, I had my signature "You can literally rip it apart and it'll still shoot you" levels of durability
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:09:37 Mechanisms don't really work out unless they're really well thought out
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:10:12 ..... <@456226577798135808> , Not everything has to be PVP oriented
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:10:22 If you want a tank that shoots, __**you**__ make a good one that's able to lob something out of it's barrel
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:10:40 Er, hold on, didn't emphasize it correctly
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:11:21 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 16:12:06 The reason they're actually "guided" is because they're meant for fighter vs fighter combat
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:18:56 Rick, the problem is super rockets are too powerful for small builds, but too weak for super huge builds (Like my Asteria)
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:19:30 Like, if you crack open one of the pods, you'll see so many super rockets that I'm probably using half the allotted amount of super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:20:28 I still personally say they're weak for gigantic builds, but for small builds, yeah they need a delay of some sort
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:21:43 Rick, I agree with the playtime limitation, as that won't weaken it too badly, but still, I'm struggling to build huge builds that maintain a respectable amount of speed without going to absurd levels of engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:22:06 How long you've played the game for
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:22:52 Uhhhhhh, 4 days might be a bit, are we talking about every single second playing, or are we talking about "From whence you first started"?
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:23:15 Ah, that'll be fine
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:26:53 The thing about gunwalls is that they have very low structural integrity, aim a gun at the correct spot and they'll go tumbling down
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:28:54 Cylinder variants to if you'd please, that'd fit better on alot of builds
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 20:29:58 .... Guys, <#384027830192832513> , use the suggest command FFS
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 21:45:35 What do you want me to do about it? Rick's the only one with banning power, unless they're in the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 21:45:40 Not in the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:52:43 Not in the mood for a full blown contest, so name your craft's stats, and test it's durability with explosive blocks, or by shaving off pieces of it until it can no longer function
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:54:44 Prime combat fighter MK3: Wyvern
4.1 seconds for a turn at full velocity of about 600 sps
Extraordinary durability, namely due to lack of motors
Extraordinary payload, able to mount extreme amounts of weight in a previous, less powerful version
Guns in a wide/narrow pattern, adjustable on the runway
7 missile hardpoints on the nose and wingtips per side
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:54:52 I use WASD
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:55:20 The Wyverns are what I use, due to the fact that anything else is not only too large a target, but they're underpowered, due to the lack of guns
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:56:38 Otherwise I'd use the Asteria
Similar levels of maneuverability to the Wyvern, even though it's literally 5X the size
A payload so massive, battleships are jealous of it
Armoring so heavy, it's nigh impossible to shoot down
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:56:43 It was on-par with my fighter
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:57:01 That was Robo's, and even then I still one-upped him with reverse thrust cappability
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:57:18 Can I just mention it still fights like this just fine?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:57:27 And I mean __**FIGHTS**__, not just flies
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:57:58 There's a difference between fight-worthy and flight-worthy you know
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:58:20 Fight-worthy means it's maneuverability, stability, speed and firepower are high enough that it can still pursue the opponent
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:58:35 Trust me it does matter alot actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:58:47 Imperial managed to land a lucky rocket hit to the cockpit and dislodge the seat
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:58:59 But it was PROPERLY inside the cockpit by the way
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:59:11 Hey, rope storms don't count, and even then it was still flying with limited maneuverability
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 00:59:27 True, but I could still fly, so it wasn't downed
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:00:03 The problem with low armor is that a scattershot will chip away at you until you snap in half
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:00:57 The default has a 4 narrow, 8 wide gun pattern, but they can be hotswapped
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:02:20 Dino, mouse controls is very slow compared to keyboard
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:02:54 PFFFFFF
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:03:04 <@456226577798135808> , no offense, but you're gonna get wrecked
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:03:27 Anything under 100 parts has so little armor that scattershots will annihilate you
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:03:59 And my thing has a narrow/wide pattern on both missiles and guns, so all I need to do is land a lucky hit and you're dead
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:04:09 Meanwhile it can literally outmaneuver rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:08:08 <@346083856081747978> , The save slots thing sounds really scummy, also the save data won't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:08:18 It's a hard-limit Roblox imposed on us
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:08:31 Locking save slots behind robux is really, REALLY scummy
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:09:06 It's a Roblox limit
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:09:15 The most we could do is optimize the game
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:09:26 __***OH GOD LET'S NOT RETURN TO THOSE DAYS***__
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:11:14 Get a rank, do" &suggest (suggestion)" in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:11:21 Check <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:12:58 <@!473990125777584139> , I can confirm, it's an easter egg straight from the dawn of this game's creation
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:13:12 SPS in the lower left hand corner
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:39:01 Hey Turbo, forgot this?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:39:58 Isn't that your fighter in the upper right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:40:05 Huh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:40:12 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 01:40:25 We should do a full server formation
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 02:43:36 <@!507721348307746816> , It depends on your plane, the center of lift should be near the center of mass (In this game, blue's center of lift, yellow's center of mass)
bug-reports 2019-03-06 02:48:25 We're debating how to open it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 02:50:56 Meh, just tired
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:03:44 <@!429665143677255681> , As much as I am jealous at how you're ABSORBING upvotes in <#504630451579781121> ,  I will agree, how the hell does he think it's a tutorial!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:04:13 ............ do you need me to knock his face inwards?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:05:15 Apparently Roblox is down, RIP, can't follow
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:16:35 <@!221487880487436288> , that doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:16:57 Believe me, people tried it against me, it literally doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:19:04 Looks like I'm gonna be busy, dino wants a dogfight and you're trying to prove something that doesn't work
help 2019-03-06 03:20:00 For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, that's all I can say without making it too ridiculously easy
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:20:29 An airburst bomb might actually be the most viable, although the problem with that is that you'd need to get infront of me
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:20:57 And considering I literally am able to do a full 360 in 4.1 seconds at a top speed of about 600, that's not exactly viable
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:21:41 Pretty much if you launch anything at me, I can out-turn it
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 03:21:45 Seeya
help 2019-03-06 03:22:00 You mean the engine or the blades?
help 2019-03-06 03:22:18 Again, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 06:32:44 Basically, Madattak laid down the foundation of the game, and occasionally pops in to work on it, but Rick's the one truly working on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 06:33:27 TL;DR it's sorta like an odd symbiotic relationship between the two
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 06:33:44 I'm very sure it's the former considering all the news about the latter
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 07:35:09 Talk about child NSFW, stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 18:44:01 Rightclick
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:37:47 Challenge accepted, which server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:38:16 Nah, just set it so anyone can join temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:38:50 Again, just set it, so anyone can follow
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:39:43 Emptiest PVP server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:40:10 Wait, seriously? It was working earlier today
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:40:38 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:41:29 Fun fact: You're actually wrong
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:41:52 LET'S MOVE IT THEN
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:48:34 You really wanna bet on that?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:50:00 That's actually half-decent armoring, the real problem's the treads and unarmored AA
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:05:43 ....
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:06:15 Under, I said cut it the fuck out, I'm not entertained anymore
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:06:38 I know I warned FuriousDonut
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:13:07 GG
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:14:15 He lost on the technical grounds that, even though we couldn't hit eachother, I managed to tail him continuously, and the few times I let him get behind me, I immediately was able to shake him off and tail him instead
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:14:22 ... The dump's the dump for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:15:03 I can't even take a 5 second break to duel someone without the server going up in flames, FFS
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:15:19 Donut, Kaze, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:15:31 <@438884464060399630> <#495286269459300364> with this conversation, now
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:16:03 <@456226577798135808> , I'm not entirely sure why, although I don't warn people without reason, and admittedly I'm one of the mods that tends to let people off for stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:16:55 Because you're the only one I see being excessively toxic
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:17:09 It's 396 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:17:23 ... I will scroll up the chat and show you the proof, if you so challenge me to
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:19:13 <@168537938211241984> , Pilot ranks are retired I believe
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:22:10 ...... You think your jokes are funny, then when someone else makes a joke, you suddenly go highly defensive, pretty much aggressively so somehow, and lash out at them
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:22:50 If you paid attention to our joking patterns, you'd KNOW when we're being serious about actually bugging people
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:23:28 Because naturally, I hate idiots, and idiots hate me
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:24:10 If you aren't, then we shouldn't have a problem, yet I'll point at this, and let it speak for it's self https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/553008473411944459/image0.png
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:24:54 If your jokes are insults, then I'm not impressed
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:25:26 They should be straightforward, but I suppose go for it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:27:46 Just act like a good person and you'll be treated with alot of passes, but act like a cocky asshole, and you'll be treated as such as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:28:10 I never said you were
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:29:22 ..... <@!507721348307746816> , I __**WISH**__ we could do something about that, only Madattak (Don't disturb him) and Rick (Offline currently) can do anything about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:29:48 It's fine, hopefully Rick can convince Madattak to get some limited in-game moderation
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:30:27 ........... Right, I'm pulling out an ultimatum here, everyone just cut it out and pretend nothing happened, and we'll continue on and hopefully resolve this just fine
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:31:01 ........... <@438884464060399630> , then make people like you
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:31:10 One way or another, make people like you
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:31:27 Er, <@456226577798135808> , could you please do that in <#384027830192832513> instead of here? You're technically accessing a bot
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:31:32 ........................................................................
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:32:16 Okay that's it, you're just trying to grab attention now Donut, first with shitposts, now victimizing yourself and pretending the only solution is getting out of the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:32:44 Here's the thing, just act normal, and follow the very gentile rules, not that hard, literally everyone else in the server does it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:33:19 Orangeskii, I've had alot of shit thrown at me, he's not being genuine about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:33:46 ............. <#497142796961054721> or <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:34:17 My patience is burned to near nothingness right now
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:34:27 Robot, the thing is, it's got alot of spread, but it's not focused
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:34:35 Aka: It's really weak at dealing damage
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:35:02 I've had one directed at me before, I didn't even loose a single part
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:35:17 We can't do anything about that
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:35:52 ..... Donut
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:36:02 For the love of god, don't pull that card
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:36:24 People have TRIED pulling out that card before, we've mostly stomped them down
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:36:57 Yes ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:37:15 That word's automatically censored
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:37:23 .... <@!336604140509593600> , Please delete that
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:37:52 We're supposed to warn people for bypassing the filter technically, but I understand what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:38:35 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:38:58 That's why I'm gonna just let you off with a total pass for that, you were just trying to mention "Oh, it's censored"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:39:09 <@!301151025308631040> , it's up to you
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:40:07 FFFFfffff, uhhhh, <@!429665143677255681> , that's a touchy subject, MAYBE!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:40:18 .............
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:40:56 Uhhhh, I'd say, proooobably not, bring it to a group DM to be safe
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:41:26 Also, Donut, you literally asked what his Roblox username was, signifying that you were unaware of the fact that everyon-
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:41:27 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:41:36 <@!429665143677255681> , your PFP's fine, I don't even know where it's from
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:41:45 <@438884464060399630> , Are you, ACTUALLY kidding me?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:42:36 Then why, do you ask, such an entirely unfunny and aggravatingly naive joke question?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:43:52 Because your questions are either entirely redundant, or you literally didn't notice my answer
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:44:06 <@!336604140509593600> , happens alot on Roblox actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:44:39 ..............................................................
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:44:57 You don't get a permaban for making a bad word, although you will get warned, and your creation will get deleted
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:45:11 It's literally rule 11 and 1 combined
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:45:20 And as Orange said, he answered your damn question
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:45:28 So please, PAY ATTENTION TO THE FUCKING CHAT
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:45:52 The punishment is Rick goes up and deletes them
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:46:30 I can give a temporary ban for amassing an excessive amount of warns in a short amount of time, for harassing people in the server, for multiple NSFW instances, and for generally being a thorn in the side of the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:46:40 Under, cut it out, I know you wanna make it funny, but it's not anymore
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:47:35 Under, "On the internet, there's no such thing as distance"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:47:56 TL;DR on that, we all fall under the same umbrella here
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:48:16 .... UHHHH
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:48:22 <@!332615504315416586> __**AHEM**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:48:48 Just, please close it fast before someone else notices
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:49:07 Also, <@!336604140509593600> , the bot tracks it in the server
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:49:15 So it doesn't matter if you block the bot or not
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:49:33 <@438884464060399630> , Why do I have to give you a joke that you're likely going to eventually steal
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:50:30 ............. So let me get this straight, to put it in a nutshell, everything you do and say is vastly more important and valuable than everything everyone else does/says?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:50:38 If not, quit acting like it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:51:39 If you think you're the one person, then you've completely merged with about 50 other people
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:51:41 .............
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:51:53 Right, the rest of you, please, back up for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:52:15 <@438884464060399630> , you're acting, like a damn, narcissistic, hypocryte
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:52:18 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:52:21 Empire
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:52:44 Why do you either intentionally or not clash with everything I do?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:53:16 All of you cut it out with the "noob" joke, unless it was a well established thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:53:58 Average strikes will decay after 1 month, although if you're lucky and very nice, sometimes the mods may look the other way for a day or two
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 00:54:31 But act like a particular asshole, or have a particularly bad action, and it'll likely linger around for a very long while
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:00:28 Question, do you WANT to get kicked or what?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:26:34 In a moment Orange
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:42:23 Sure, which server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:44:25 Sure I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:27:12 MGs aren't your problem, rockets are
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:04:21 Then that's a bad rocket design on the opponent's part, I set up my fighters so I can launch, at minimum, 2 alternating volleys of rockets, at most, 4 in a narrow/wide pattern
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:04:31 Namely so they don't detonate eachother
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:06:22 Are you using beams or individual blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:08:09 Ah, you're probably too huge a target, so focused MG fire is all hitting, and that results in it just coring through your hull
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:09:57 Mechwarrior style mech? (With jumpjets)

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:11:08 Then why don't you try it? Make a King Crab with jumpjets
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:11:48 Hey, it's the best I've got that fits your criteria, no wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:12:27 Then you're just gonna make something boring, probably a tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:13:15 __***HAHAHAHAHAAAHHHH***__, there's no such thing, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:22 Vic Viper model thing? https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGIIwIoUAAAnQ1Z.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:34 Clusterbombs, already been made
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:50 They're ineffective if anything
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:16:18 It's crazy effective, but one shot will blow it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:17:01 3 TNT isn't alot, plus again, one shot will blow the TNT up
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:17:17 Double plus, the explosive force can overlap, so 50 exploding in the same spot won't make a nuke
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:17:37 So it's better to have a giant net of bombs than to have a focused shell
creations-chat 2019-03-07 05:18:02 Hey, what am I? Chopped liver?
creations-chat 2019-03-07 05:20:03 What, am, I, chopped, liver? Seriously, have you seen the Asteria?
creations-chat 2019-03-07 05:20:51 ....................................
creations-chat 2019-03-07 05:21:35 Screw originality
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:37:29 Not bad
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:39:45 <@456226577798135808> , Feel lucky I'm not warning you for that, don't try to ransom posting creations behind a follower count, that just looks very scummy
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:42:31 It's not a specifically stated rule, but I will file it under rule 11, on the account of not only is it very childish, spiteful and scummy, but it's also the complete opposite way to gain any meaningful followers
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:45:09 Trust me, the followers you will gain from that are mindless lemmings that friend everyone and follow what a scambot says (I should know from my baby cousin ... damn idiot he is)
bug-reports 2019-03-08 01:45:25 Save and load it again
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:46:13 It means you can swear a bit, but not too much, and not in a hostile manner
Counter question, is English your native language?
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:47:27 ... Nothing I guess
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:48:55 I'm probably simultaneously the nicest and most vicious moderator you'll meet on the server (In terms of actual moderator action), depends on if you're a good person or not
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:49:10 <@!486674992981999648> __**HEY**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 01:49:38 ......... Goooot it, sorry, bit twitchy today, really rough testing
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:49:53 Who?
creations-chat 2019-03-08 01:50:02 Ah, I think I do
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:04:27 Guys, can you cut it out?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:04:38 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:05:10 "Dispenser" more like railgun, but meh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:58:01 Probably because I'm the only one paying attention to the chat and have full context of what you're saying
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 04:58:11 In terms of aesthetics, 8/10
In terms of visual functionality (As far as I can tell), 5/10

You can't look good and function good at the same time (Unless you're somehow magic)
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:20:19 Ehhhh, I'm fine, thanks though
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 07:51:52 What'd be interesting is proper sonar and crap, alongside a much deeper ocean, that way we're able to properly do submarine battles and use depth charges and crud
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 07:55:25 "Cold Waters" style would be freaking hard to do (As it's basically what the whole game revolves around), but freaking epic as well, properly active vs passive sonar and shapes actually being picked up
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 21:48:18 Just drop it guys, rules aren't set in absolute stone, if they were, everyone would probably have like 3-4 warns at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:40:34 <@!454809803223465984> , CAN YOU PLEASE, CUT IT OUT!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:40:45 For the love of god you've completely washed out the mod logs
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:43:58 ............... All of you, quit trying to screw around with the bots before I start clobbering you all
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:45:11 <@!301151025308631040> , why exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:45:19 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:46:10 Right, I've had enough of this, there's a reason we do all of this shit, and sometimes it's not obvious, but almost all of the time, they're very, very good reasons
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:46:34 Look in <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:47:09 ... You two deal with this, this is why I no longer get involved with stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:49:28 <@456226577798135808> , I SAID FUCKING CUT IT OUT! NOW IT'S JUST ANNOYING!
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:49:51 You said "ok" the last 30 damn times you did it, now freaking cut it out!
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:55:32 Right, I'm gonna start muting people unless they drag it to <#495286269459300364> , and by this point I'm very, very pissed off, so I'm not exactly patient
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:57:52 .................................................... Integex, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:59:16 Flame, so long as you don't break the server, you don't have to worry
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 02:59:44 Blame Voxel not updating the link I think, dunno how it works
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:00:08 All I know is he's got control of the bots and links, so
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:00:57 I told him to stop
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:01:00 He didn't
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:01:19 I asked him, repeatedly, to stop making fun of my name, because b y this point, it got very, very, __***VEEERRRYYYY***__ irritating
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:01:25 And they didn't stop
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:01:40 So I decided to stop them before I decided to clobber them to a fine paste with a warn
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:02:09 Once is fine, five times gets irritating, over thirty times repeatedly the exact same way, that's just plain harassment
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:02:16 ......
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:02:20 I know what truly happened
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:02:39 I'd rather not say to preserve my current standing, but I know what happened
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:03:17 He's changing the VIP links now, expect it to work soon
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:03:34 <@!435946988559925248> , he was at one point
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:03:46 Voxel, permission to show screenshots?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:04:19 ... I'll just leave it be at "I know what happened"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:04:47 They're asking about what happened to Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:05:44 He got demoted because of this guy https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502528217425510401/533689077376090141/Capture_38.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:06:02 Notice anything suspicious? Particularly as to the name he joined under?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:06:26 He came in with Imperial's name
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:06:56 
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:07:06 Flame, just tell him it's 10 minutes and it's from me
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:07:38 I mean, you DID request it, and you know I'm as serious as a damn spear, but I'll try to unwarn you
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:08:21 <@!435946988559925248> , Yes, that's what happened
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:08:49 Rule 4, which was still around before the rules update
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:09:05 He even had Imperial's exact same PFP, the battleship
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:09:21 Me and Imperial double-teamed on him, but Voxel vetoed it, at the very least that's my side of the truth
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:10:08 One was legitimate and 10 days away from expiring, but to be honest, close enough
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:11:00 Orange, he was floating around 1 for a while, so it seems like he's getting at least somewhat better
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:11:47 Anyways, for those that were wondering what I meant when I said "I know what happened", now you know
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:12:05 Creepy, don't try to ping Rick please, he's offline now and he's usually very busy
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:12:36 If it's something major, like finding out how to completely rework the code without breaking everything, THEN you can ping him, otherwise please try to refrain from that
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:12:46 He does read over literally every bug report, so
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:13:06 <@456226577798135808> , I told you, to cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:13:15 I, fucking told you, but you didn't listen
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:13:23 Try it again, and see what happens, I dare you
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:13:36 It's fine, you had good intentions at least
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:14:00 I was always here, just very tired and pissed, so I'm not acting like myself
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:14:44 <@!353243589414748168> , why do you need that exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:15:07 Oh, that
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:15:15 Ignore that geinuous, it's, stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:15:27 Alot of stuff, like, a fuckton, just don't ask
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:16:15 Beceause that one's been dead, since nobody really used it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:16:28 Go to <#384027830192832513> and go "!servers", and Mee6 will DM you the most updated list of servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:16:52 Granted, every time someone lets a troll (not a geinuous troll) in, we have to refresh the links, which means we can have extended outages of the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:17:17 So please, DON'T SHARE THE DAMN LINK WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE SERVER
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:17:41 Integex, your warns were cleared, all of them
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:17:45 ?Warnings <@!511080180966752256>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:17:46 See?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:19:13 Guys, what do you want from Rick, he's got a life outside of Plane Crazy you know

general 2019-03-09 03:28:21 Geinuous, delete that, now
general 2019-03-09 03:28:54 <@!430739561690431489> , For the love of god, rule 10, we keep it for a reason, the reason being: It's hard to moderate for non-English users
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:30:17 ..... Let me put it bluntly to you all, IT'S BECAUSE YOU ALL RUSH HIM, THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S SO BROKEN
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:30:34 Now please, let him actually polish out his work before he hurls it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:31:02 My point is if you rush someone, they need to start cutting corners, when they start cutting corners, they wind up with a poorer product
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:31:31 ........ <@!439628673545666571> , Did I __**SAY**__ it was you who rushed him?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:32:02 <@540343176314093569> ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:32:51 <@!439628673545666571> , We keep on  getting "triggered" because people keep on trying to screw every single little thing up, and we're all really tired
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:33:08 Dark, blame Roblox physics for that
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:33:19 Battleship, someone might have a good suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:34:08 The problem with multiple full time developers is that they might work in different ways, so one's code may be unreadable to another
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:34:55 Imagine only knowing English, and being asked to read an Arabic (or something) script, and the other person's vice-versa, that doesn't work now does it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:35:21 <@540343176314093569> , What's intuitive to one might not be intuitive to another
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:36:04 Point is, it's ultimately up to Rick AND Madattak to decide whether they want to hire another person or not
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:36:13 ... <@540343176314093569> , Please, read what Orange said
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:36:53 
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:37:34 It's minus minus, the thing to the left of =, past the 0 on the standard QWERTY keyboard
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:37:42 <@540343176314093569> , No advertising
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:38:26 Maybe once Plane Crazy's in a functional state again and we have enough people making distinct enough builds in various sections, but until then, not really
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:39:29 It's ultimately up to him, because he's draped a very big "no touchie" sign on all of the channels for us
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:45:42 ... <@540343176314093569>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:46:06 Do not, try that again
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:46:10 ?warnings <@540343176314093569>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:46:16 What?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:47:02 And I have like 5 caches of armor piercing warns and a ban hammer launcher, now cut it out Silver
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:47:17 Done <@!353243589414748168>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:48:07 One more and I'm gonna blast another warn in your face, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:48:20 (Yes yes my signature "Got it", woo I guess)
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:49:05 What do you use for it's flotation?
the-dump 2019-03-09 03:49:20 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:49:30 <@!326460241048895489> , RICK IS FIXING THAT, please be patient
the-dump 2019-03-09 03:49:46 I'll wipe it out for you, but don't try it again
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:49:56 Probably because it's top-heavy
the-dump 2019-03-09 03:50:35 ..................
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:51:56 Berg we know, Rick's fixing it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:52:48 <@438884464060399630> , THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF __**THIS**__ UPDATE
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:53:18 I'm just, very pissed off because everything's gone to shit in every way over here, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:53:50 Oh "are you?" .....
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:54:06 Rick already made an announcement
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:54:16 And Voxel's gonna stab me if I ping everyone
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:54:43 Furious, we get it, blame lag, Rick didn't have time to polish it because everyone was begging for parachutes to be rushed out the door
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:55:14 What else am I supposed to say really? "The magical fairy demon screwed up the game"? That's the only other thing I can say
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:55:30 Then be PATIENT, and try to get others to be patient as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 03:55:39 But don't force it upon them ...
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:58:01 <@!430739561690431489> , <@!433909197533478922>  __***WE FUCKING KNOW, READ THE ANNOUNCEMENTS, RICK IS FIXING THIS***__
bug-reports 2019-03-09 03:58:16 Sorry, this is just the BILLIONTH time someone complained about everything being broken ...
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:01:27 ..... <@!228115104061849612> , read the stuff right above what you just typed
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:02:41 I don't know, by actually bothering to look around at more than just your ass? Rick literally stated it in <#490306593242611742> with a ping to everyone
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:03:03 That's what I think is the most annoying part, Rick even pinged people about it and nobody notices it
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:04:17 And yet you've read the rules, which states the purpose of each channel, or supposedly you did ...
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:05:12 .......................................... Read them again
bug-reports 2019-03-09 04:06:09 We're aware of that, thanks anyways though
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:06:36 <@438884464060399630> , it's friendly competition, he did the same to me and I accepted the competition
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:07:26 You know, it's hard to tell when you're joking Furious, at least for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:08:28 Missiles don't track fast enough
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:08:34 Surface to Air Missile
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:09:56 Dino, stationary targets just plain die against me
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:11:04 You won't be able to intercept my fighter is the thing, people have tried
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:11:29 ~600 studs for me, it's not speed that matters in this particular fight, it's maneuverability
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:12:28 4.1 seconds to do a full 360 degree turn
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:12:47 Flies at level speed at about 600
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:13:43 Can reverse thrust straight vertically at a speed of 64, and it's armor is incredibly, INCREDIBLY durable, with an excessive amount of potential hardpoints for weapons
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:14:22 The only 2 weaknesses are the cockpit, if it flies face-first into a missile it's dead, and the wide vertical target profile, which it makes up for with it's incredibly narrow frontal and side target profile
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:15:00 Plus it can still actively fight like this, which is bonkers considering how much damage it took
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:15:55 As you can see by the picture above, mine's got a relatively high degree of controllability, even while sustaining incredibly high levels of damage
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:16:14 The + icon to the left of the textbox you're typing in
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:16:43 May I present the MK1, the weakest of the bunch, the Wyrm, with it's maximal payload?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:16:58 FYI, all those blocks it's carrying are max weight ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:17:29 Also, notice how it's using jet engines?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:17:34 Not super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:18:02 Yeup, Wyverns are STUPIDLY well built little buggers that will downright ruin your day
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:19:10 <@!334232774502514689> , Roblox bug, also update instability, give Rick time to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:19:28 And Furious, that's what everyone says, until you install a rotary gun on the opposing craft
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:19:45 Rotary guns increase the spread of the weapon
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:19:54 Aka: You're gonna pepper the skies with that
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:20:06 It's good for smaller craft as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:20:10 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:22:16 MK1 "Wyrm"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:22:29 MK2 "Salamander"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:22:36 MK3 "Wyvern"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:23:09 MK4 "Dragon" (Still a fighter in terms of performance)
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:23:17 MK 5 "King Dragon"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:23:26 MK 6 "Asteria"
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:23:43 Also, the MK 1 and 2 are retired at this point, so they're there for nothing more than nostalga
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:23:52 I used the Wyvern to wreck you
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:24:06 I need bigger parts for the larger craft
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:24:35 Please don't use .wmvs, convert it through something
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:24:39 .wmv files can house viruses
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:25:30 "Hahaha", but seriously though, if I ever do decide to go past MK 6, I'd need larger and more potent parts
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:25:43 The amount of work I had to go through to make the MK 6 work was insane
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:26:04 Like, "Multiple brain aneurysms" levels of insane
creations-chat 2019-03-09 04:26:36 There's Roblox instructions on how to do so, Google, and worst comes to worst, use some sort of converter to convert it to a GIF or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:27:12 I might make an interceptor and bomber line, but that's for another day
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:27:49 I can reverse-engineer the crafts from the pictures I have
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:28:09 Basically rebuild them
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:28:29 Oh yeah, I forgot to mention key things, they __***ALL***__ have reverse thrust of some sort
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:28:44 To the point where they can ALL go straight vertically with reverse thrust
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:29:20 Let me just say it was an absolute bitch getting the Asteria's reverse thrust in working order, because that thing's a damn 1.7K beast of a thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:29:34 Block count
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:29:54 Not to mention it's a solid state craft, so there ain't no folding in it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:30:25 Folding's what creates structural weaknesses in crafts, namely with motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:32:03 <@!334232774502514689> , Well of COURSE it's gonna float
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:35:43 <@456226577798135808> , __**DUH**__, they're adjustably heavy
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:44:30 ....... <@275772366687043584> , read the announcements please
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:46:38 He's fixing it already
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:46:54 Now please, stop, I've had to repeat that same statement a billion times over, and it's driving me insane at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:47:03 ... DINO!
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 04:47:23 Don't do that again if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 05:03:27 I'm already working on it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 05:03:56 __**I'M WORKING ON IT!**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 05:04:05 I'm talking to him
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 05:04:55 
general 2019-03-09 19:36:14 It's not the official Armored Patrol, also they've done alot of "rebalancing" to the game (Beforehand, it was APC > Heli > Tank > APC, now it's all over the place)
general 2019-03-09 19:36:25 So don't be surprised if they throw a joke vehicle or two in there
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:40:47 RIP all my creations except the Wyvern then
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:41:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:41:37 Probably weight and buff, but a higher buff to compensate for that
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:43:01 I'd say edit it "engines will be stronger to compensate for this" or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 19:43:30 The main problem that everyone's having a hard time swallowing is that they think everything will get heavier, but nothing will change to compensate for this, so it'll be near impossible to lift off again
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 20:01:45 I can see what fonkl means, unless you balance it to the exact ratio currently (Lazy example: 30 blocks per helium block, 1 ballast = 2 blocks, so 15 ballasts per helium block), stuff might come back not being able to float
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 20:03:03 I'm staying neutral to this
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:41:06 <@456226577798135808> ............
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:41:24 Please tone it down, it looks like you're just here to mock the admins/moderators
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:48:23 ?warnings <@!376540230980861953>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:48:53 ............ Matheus
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:48:54 2 things
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:49:20 1: Anything can be a joke, hell, even me shooting you in the head with an M1911 can be a joke, but nobody thinks that's a joke now is it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:49:38 2: Rule apply to jokes
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:50:51 <@!376540230980861953> , it's not rude, it's called actually bothering to follow the rules, something that every other person seems to be able to do
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:51:05 Nobody was using them Rick, they mostly use "!servers" now in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:54:21 __**OH WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH <@!439628673545666571> HEY!**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:54:55 NOW T HEN
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:55:50 Now let that be a basic lesson to the rest of you, DO NOT, BREAK, RULE 2, UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES
creations-chat 2019-03-09 23:56:01 Except flying vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:56:14 The update should fix it
plane-crazy 2019-03-09 23:56:41 I mean, 2 NSFW warns, __**AND**__ repeatedly trying to post the exact same inappropriate thing repeatedly
creations-chat 2019-03-09 23:58:37 It, actually isn't that strong
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:00:12 ......................
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:00:20 Right, right right right
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:00:21 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:00:40 Quit pushing Rickje around, he's doing the best he can, and rushing him to do things won't help
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:00:53 Mention it once please, and check to see if what you've mentioned isn't already mentioned
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:01:02 .............. Don't Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:01:07 I'll just erase that and explain it to him
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:01:10 Very, very thoroughly
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:02:02 <@!376540230980861953> DMs, now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:03:42 I explained it to <@!376540230980861953> , he shouldn't cause any more problems
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:04:35 .... <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:04:40 I literally told you
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:04:45 Please, be, __**PATIENT**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:05:06 He's fully aware of this, it's literally 1:04 AM where he is, now give him time to sleep and live his actual life
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:05:28 Please, just consolidate everything into one GIGANTIC list and dump it in <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:05:47 <@!324566285155434497> OY!
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:06:06 ............ Well, at least you deleted it quickly
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:06:25 <@!493498793203990563> , it's because Rick worked on it at 1:00 AM because everyone was whining about the update
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:06:32 Now please, BE PATIENT AND LET HIM WORK ON IT
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:07:03 ............ Imperial, leave it to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:07:08 ?slowmode off
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:07:15 Er, wait, Mee, not Dyno
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:07:22 Right, all of you
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:07:45 Please, can it for a moment, and listen, Rick's aware of all these updates breaking everything, he's working incredibly hard to fix them
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:08:21 It's 1:07 AM over where he's at, and he has a mirror image of Plane Crazy as a personal test server, to see if anything breaks, none of these were picked up in the mirror image server
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:09:00 So please, be patient, report these bugs/glitches/problems in <#498473314445033472> , and if your report's already been made, please do not report it again, but do some way to show "I have this problem to"
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:09:12 Probably because he's rolling it backwards due to everyone complaining
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:09:56 ... <@!493498793203990563> , whyyyy?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:10 Please re-read the rules <@!493498793203990563>
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:15 Guys, just
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:22 What do you want from us?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:39 <@!433909197533478922> , Update
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:50 <@456226577798135808> , THEN WAIT FOR HIM TO FIX EVERYTHING OR ELSE HE MIGHT BRICK THE DAMN GAME
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:10:53 <@!368161838149402645> , YOU TO!
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:11:00 ...................
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:11:47 It's literally 1:11 AM where Rick lives, and he's got a life outside of Plane Crazy to you know
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:12:10 Not to mention, Roblox keeps on changing their damn physics, so it's even harder to keep up with stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:12:31 I'm sure some of you will remember when Roblox broke WASD in Plane Crazy and alot of games, right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:12:42 Royal, most people tend to listen __**BECAUSE**__ they're so nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:13:13 And while I admit I do tend to withhold warnings and bans for people that sometimes deserve them, they won't learn if you beat them on the head without telling them why, and from experience I can say even if you tell them why, they might not listen
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:13:46 Dino, Rick's probably already aware of it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:14:15 Here's the thing, when debugging (Or getting the playerbase to debug for you), every little detail helps
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:14:24 <@!376540230980861953> , HE'S AWARE OF IT, please be patient
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:14:35 <@456226577798135808> , ultimately it's up to Rick to do so
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:14:43 Guys, don't spam it please
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:15:00 Imperial, as much as it looks like a dumpster fire, I'm watching over everything and making sure nothing's broken, I've got the time and energy to do so
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:15:21 <@266718250501406722> , Please just cut it out with the over the top attitude, people are genuinely confused sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:15:52 Matheus, give Rick time and please be patient, in the mean time play whatever else you've got, it should be working by tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:16:36 Guys, listen up a bit if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:16:47 He'll add that to his long-list of things to do, but he needs to make the base game work first
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:16:56 So please, be patient, he's probably already got that on his long list of things to do
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:17:07 The issue is, what good's computer blocks if the game it's self doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:17:34 He's gonna fix the game first, then probably add logic gates or something, depends on demand, difficulty and time availability
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:17:58 Er, let me explain a bit more
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:18:05 <@!376540230980861953> , DMs again
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:18:32 Matheus, DMs
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:20:15 I already explained it to Matheus what was going on, he said he won't overwhelm Rick anymore
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:20:42 Imperial, I had the chat under control FYI, it was chaotic, but I did have it (relatively) under control
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:21:35 Pffff, okay no but seriously I am starting to get burned out a bit monitoring literally ~8 people at once chatting, so could you please calm down a bit?
the-dump 2019-03-10 00:22:32 <@!360925918081974272> , the top and bottom ones of that bunch were inappropriate, middle one's fine though
the-dump 2019-03-10 00:22:43 No euphemisms and no jokes about suicide please
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:24:15 <@!265546886260195329> , Rick's trying his hardest to fix everything, give him time
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:24:36 He's being asked to hurl out updates at 1:00 AM
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:24:57 <@266718250501406722> , No need to be agressive about it, jeez, your passion's nice, but try to contain it a bit?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:25:05 Yeup, it's 1:25 AM for him right now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:30:31 -Facepalm- it's a running gag of this, since apparently everyone likes me so much, dunno why
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:31:13 I think Plane Crazy was it's own thing even before Stormworks was a thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:40:33 Everything SHOULD be working now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:51:58 <@456226577798135808> ......
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:53:15 I dare you to try again
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:53:38 An IP ban that bypasses VPNs via multiple bots
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:54:10 And he's gone
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:54:33 Not a problem, we don't appreciate toxic pe- <@263770097288609794> Heeeyyyy!
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:54:44 Let me just wipe that out
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:55:05 This is what we have to deal with on a daily basis, not to mention we also have to balance between murdering people and being nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:55:21 ................... Uhhhh, <@266718250501406722> , I'm gonna just wipe that for you if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 00:55:30 I know, correct context and stuff, but, I'm just probably gonna wipe it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:07:19 Rick's fixed it, supposedly, and from everyone's saying
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:07:53 That's what you call Algebra + Geometry I believe
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:51:12 Rick, get some sleep, you deserve it
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:25:00 ... <@456226577798135808> , he's joking
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:25:14 In age he's over 13, in HEIGHT he's under 13 feet
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:50:26 I mean, I'd probably try to be the exception
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:50:42 But ultimately, admin or mod or whatever, I'm just fine helping the server
creations-chat 2019-03-10 02:51:19 Uhhhh, hmmmm, try <#478584971670454284> , since <#550286359064084480> is still under maintenance (And cleaning of mods fooling around)
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:51:35 Welp
help 2019-03-10 02:52:31 You have my written/typed permission to do so as long as it's not NSFW, although if it is, uhhh, it's a bit of a sensitive topic
help 2019-03-10 02:53:42 N.S.F.W: Not Safe For Work, basically anything that's highly inappropriate, you wouldn't show to anyone in public
help 2019-03-10 02:54:02 (Yes there is a running joke of "NSFW" being a person in an office standing on a chair, but still)
help 2019-03-10 02:54:06 My DMs are always open
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 02:56:26 I usually just talk to people before ~~breaking their faces by using a tank like a club until they're a bloody mess on the floor~~ warning them
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:00:51 <@456226577798135808> , I don't think it's allowed
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:03:54 <@!365207262987550720> Let me guess, you're spinning out?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:05:52 I'll put it this way <@!365207262987550720> , for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, and that's for __**EVERY**__ action
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:06:56 To put it simply, when your rotor blades spin, they're also putting force on your heli's body
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:08:05 <@427454208292421653> , Ranked, also ranked with carrier commando, since I can tell it's capable of fitting airborne vehicles on it's deck with ease
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:09:05 Not a problem
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:10:21 All pilot roles were from a previous iteration, if you didn't get them then, you won't get them now
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:12:17 <@!548514581455175680> , We were fully aware of this actually, it doesn't ACTUALLY affect them
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:24:22 __**WAIT A MOMENT**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 03:25:07 Imperial, I was going to say "You already clocked him once for the very picture we saw", but, welp
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:20 I mean, the thing about the naming system is, it picks up your Roblox profile name
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:26 So it's synched up to the one on Roblox
creations-chat 2019-03-10 03:29:41 For example: If you search up my Discord name on Roblox, you'll find my account
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:54:29 I really hope that's a joke, I can't tell jokes from being serious
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:54:56 FYI yes I'm back, had to take a break for my heart after real life stresses got too much, I'm fine now though
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:55:11 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:55:24 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:55:28 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:55:48 I was gone when whatever happened happened, sorry, I'll go through <#384025409945337856> and see what I can find
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:56:32 Pffff, you haven't seen me paint a wall with someone's bleeding face then
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:59:18 Meh, to be honest I've sometimes let people min/mod under my name via calling me over, it, halfway worked
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 23:59:58 I mean, teeechnically it's partially on topic because it's about the server, but at the same time, <#497142796961054721> is slightly more applicable
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:02:43 Just run down a brief TL;DR with them
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:03:33 I mean, it's sorta what mods have to do sometimes, they see an argument's heating up or about to start, so they jump in
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:03:42 PFFFF, there aren't even that many parts in-game
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:04:10 Nice editing Neutro, it's actually somewhat believable, apart from how ridiculous the amount of parts are
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:04:46 Uhhh, hello there <@!202959294705041408>
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:05:42 Friendly reminder to go to <#497142796961054721> , also I'd like you to change your PFP Colonel, but you're still free to keep it, considering it's not breaking any of the rules
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:06:11 Hey look, floating turbo tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:06:36 You're technically allowed to Colonel, but it'd be preferable to change it
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:07:04 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:07:18 Joey, just do it in a bunch
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:07:37 Do it in a gigantic bunch like this gigantic wall of text, or do it very quickly in another server, copy that then paste it here
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:08:30 You sure ctrl+V is broken?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:08:39 If so, use rightclick instead, it should work
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:08:59 Wait seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:09:15 RIP, got anything important up?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:09:35 Save the link for it in another 'Cord server or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:10:04 ....... Okay that might be pushing it a bit
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:10:17 I mean, the most NSFW that could be is a kiss, but still, tone it back a bit please
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:10:32 Professionalism
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:11:49 Colonel, please, unless you have some constructive criticism, try to be nice, unless it's JUST that bad
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:12:49 I mean, you typed it in a way that could be seen as offensive
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:07 Oh, that's because to be honest, it is pretty low on the relative quality standard
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:32 First of all, it's trying to blend function and fashion together, which ~~almost~~ never works
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:13:51 Second, all the functionality parts it DOES have are ineffective, at best, even considering all the possible scenarios it'd be in
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:14:29 The only clever part is how he used the landing gear like a little radar, and even then people have done that before, it's not new
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:14:40 What'd he get muted for?
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:15:08 Likely he did something that grabbed negative attention
creations-chat 2019-03-16 00:15:59 No idea, probably for something though, I know the mod team might be a bit twitchy here and there, but they don't do this stuff for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:17:13 "Quack" -Duck
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:16 I mean, he's probably gonna fix it sooner rather than later
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:31 Okay, probably time to move to <#497142796961054721> if we'd please
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:36 Colonel, he's deafened
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:43 Observe
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:52 See that slashed headphone symbol?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:19:57 That means I can't hear anyone
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:20:23 So, <@!202959294705041408> , it wasn't that he wasn't responding, it was that he couldn't hear you, period
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:20:30 Nor anyone else technically
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:21:03 I mean, people that go afk
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:21:10 People that don't want to listen to stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:21:14 So on and so forth
general 2019-03-16 00:21:38 Wait what?
general 2019-03-16 00:21:42 Try unmuting yourself?
general 2019-03-16 00:22:01 RIP? I'll fix that
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:22:13 I know, must've been ASMR going haywire
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:22:49 -Ignore me while I make sure nobody's ruining stuff in the voicechat-
general 2019-03-16 00:22:58 Oh hey, I play Dungeon Quest Grablador
general 2019-03-16 00:24:09 Uhhhhhh
general 2019-03-16 00:24:17 Rythm's suppose to be in ASMR
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:24:33 Under, it's suppose to be in ASMR if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:24:50 Who said that!?
general 2019-03-16 00:25:11 It's not a crazy grind
general 2019-03-16 00:25:16 Just gotta be with a good team
general 2019-03-16 00:27:01 Huh, cool
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:27:17 Hey, I don't speak because I don't like people knowing my voice
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:28:01 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:28:14 Holy crap the VC's growing big, oh god
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:28:45 <@!326460241048895489> __**HEY**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:28:58 I'll erase that for you, but don't try it again
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:29:03 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:29:11 There we go
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:32:35 Hey, I'm still listening to the chat by the way
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:35:59 <@!555884687998976010>
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:36:05 Hey look who just got unmuted
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:36:09 Now play nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:36:25 NOW BE SURE TO PLAY NICE, GOT IT!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:36:33 <@!326460241048895489> , Hey
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:36:38 No spamming if you'd please
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:37:26 Hey look, a channel for Dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:37:33 Dungeon Quest stuff should go in <#497142796961054721> please
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:37:51 I mean, it's __**THE**__ most popular game on Roblox, so
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:38:11 Hey, I only did it because half the VC was playing dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:39:13 <@!264769733021270016> , <@!340543153922768906> and whoever else is playing Dungeon Quest, new VC

plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:39:54 Imperial, I'll boost ya
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 00:40:22 Probably should sleep
general 2019-03-16 00:52:50 You're all in different servers <@352928457358835715> <@!340543153922768906>

general 2019-03-16 01:46:34 Hello <@456226577798135808>
general 2019-03-16 02:02:18 Hello
general 2019-03-16 02:02:23 ... Excuse me?
general 2019-03-16 02:02:33 <@!202959294705041408> What were you saying?
general 2019-03-16 02:02:55 Don't say that please, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:13 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:16 He said something inappropriate
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:37 Parachutes aren't the worst for landing
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:39 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:44 Try that again, I dare you ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:03:59 Fancyish, not you airliner, you're fine
general 2019-03-16 02:04:15 Back to me, or, we time I guess
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:04:54 Motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:05:34 That's the most you can do honestly
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:08:30 <@!221487880487436288> , We have the Other Games VC for that very reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:08:37 Like half the VC was playing Dungeon Quest, so
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:09:06 If you can find us, feel free to latch on if you can, if not, try to find high levels in a server that you can join
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:09:10 Doesn't have to be a crazy high level
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:13:38 Hey, what's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:13:52 Someone tell me what happened with Fancy
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:16:44 There's a multipalyer mod
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:16:55 If you're playing Subnautica multiplayer (Somehow), you've got Other Games available
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:21:00 I'm making sure nothing's burning down
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:25:55 WHO SAID THAT!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:25:58 WHO THE FUCK SAID THAT!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:26:06 <@!264769733021270016> !!!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:26:15 NONE OF THAT!
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:26:27 Don't say that again or else, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:26:49 Don't ask
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:27:08 I'd rather not
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:27:27 Unless you want a goodnight kiss from a banhammer, no goodnight kiss
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:27:46 ... Okay maybe that's a bit mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:30:58 <@!486674992981999648> "Bruh"!
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:31:24 Welp, as long as nobody minds it
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:33:44 No thanks
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:33:52 Playing Dungeon Quest with Orange, Imperial and G4M3
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:34:02 Meh
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:34:18 Alright G4M3
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 02:34:31 Uno's only 4 players

general 2019-03-16 02:40:09 Jumping to Orange's
general 2019-03-16 02:42:32 <#495286269459300364> if you don't mind det
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:05:33 __**HEY**__ WHO SAID WHAT!?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:05:56 I heard someone broke a rule
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:06:27 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:06:39 I'll trust you to not break people's faces too hard spy
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:06:46 But break people's faces sufficiently
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:20:52 Det, be nice, he isn't looking for a high rank
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:21:10 .... <@!326460241048895489> , I can see what you've deleted, be, nice
creations-chat 2019-03-16 03:21:25 Not everyone's a god maestro of Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:21:33 <@456226577798135808> What is it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:21:49 What's it of/for?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:22:11 No it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:22:19 We've had literal number overflows, and the speed going infinite before
general 2019-03-16 03:26:35 Melee
general 2019-03-16 03:26:40 Also, that's it for now, seeya guys
help 2019-03-16 03:37:23 <#384027830192832513>
help 2019-03-16 03:37:38 Check to see if your suggestion was made, and make sure it's a good and well-explained suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:39:01 Well, you said something bad, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 03:39:07 What do you expect?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 04:01:12 Happens alot, Rick tried to crush that bug so many times
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 04:35:21 I mean, he's the server owner
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 04:35:26 What do you want from him?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 04:35:47 Technically if he wanted to he could try to do a hostile takeover, but he doesn't because Rick or someone else would just make another server
help 2019-03-16 05:19:40 You mean treads?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:30:28 Given enough time, practice (and luck), you can hit someone from almost any distance
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:30:34 I should know
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:30:50 It's not exactly modeller either, since people have made tracks with that style before
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:31:24 I know what he's saying
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:31:38 He means, the fact that it's so far away, the bullet drop meant that you'd have to aim higher than the crosshair would allow
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:31:47 Good attempt though
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:32:22 It's the thing you use for scopes and such
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:32:38 I think Katze did a battleship style aim, or a luck aim
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:33:12 I was about to say
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:33:38 Yielding, it was a miscommunication, leave it at that
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:33:51 What they're saying is shostre got hit by a lucky shot from Katze
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:34:39 Yielding, they did say guns and only guns
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:34:45 I can confirm that
creations-chat 2019-03-16 05:35:05 Someone has "invented" a useless box, sorry Legendary
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:35:27 Yielding, it's called bullet drop, and I can confirm, you can reach to and fro the mountains with guns
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:35:34 Infact, with a certain degree of ease truth be told
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:35:54 No physics in the parts?
the-dump 2019-03-16 05:36:47 Whatever happened to him? All the other stuff he does is just plain amazing madness
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:41:16 .......... Both of you, please, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:42:11 Trust me, neither of you want me to do something, so both of you just suck it up and cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:42:25 At the very least take it to DMs
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:43:28 Katze ... please just drop it
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:44:24 <@!228115104061849612> , Not a good time, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:46:44 ........................................
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 05:48:51 ........ Wrong order
general 2019-03-16 06:15:41 Pretty cool
general 2019-03-16 06:16:07 Note: Melee has a higher DPS than magic, even the entire Dungeon Quest Discord server agrees with it
general 2019-03-16 06:17:12 The game will boot you for that
general 2019-03-16 06:17:20 I saw it happen to a couple of people
general 2019-03-16 06:18:36 Empire, what level?
general 2019-03-16 06:19:30 Ouch, got nothing for your level, sorry Empire
general 2019-03-16 06:19:41 I'll do a couple of insane runs and get loot to dump on you tomorrow
general 2019-03-16 06:19:49 For today though, I'm burned out
general 2019-03-16 06:20:52 Also expect me to do a couple of insane runs first though, I need to improve my kit
general 2019-03-16 06:21:06 Even though I got 2 arcane barrages from a guy I worked amazingly closely with, I'm still underpowered
general 2019-03-16 06:21:07 Winter
general 2019-03-16 06:21:53 Also, hilariously enough, I had the exact same gear as him, and no points into melee damage, and I managed to match his DPS
general 2019-03-16 06:22:04 Trust me, it's almost double the duration
general 2019-03-16 06:23:46 So, to round it up, X2 the damage per arcane barrage, 2 arcane barrages, X4 damage
general 2019-03-16 06:23:59 That's pretty effing op considering
general 2019-03-16 06:24:28 Battle shout
general 2019-03-16 06:24:37 Problem with that is the 20 second cooldown on it
general 2019-03-16 06:24:51 8 seconds of buff, 12 seconds of downtime, less than 1.5X your total DPS
general 2019-03-16 06:25:08 Not actually as worth it as it may seem, namely for the base attack
general 2019-03-16 06:25:21 Innervate's another thing altogether however, 10 second cooldown, 8 second duration, 2 second downtime
general 2019-03-16 06:25:48 A friend tried it, it's about on-par assuming no melee swings
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:36:46 Raaaaawwwwrrrrrrr
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:37:27 Okay no I'm gonna sleep now g'night
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:51:22 What the heck did I get woken up for?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:51:56 You pinged two mods, so it's probably a mod problem
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:52:15 ... What? It's 2:52 AM over here and I'm not in a joking mood, so please be serious
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:52:44 Then what do you mean by that?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:53:44 It's just a joke, and it's easily recognizable as such, since the mod team's usually very much ontop of that (almost too much so infact)
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:54:42 Then please just acknowledge it's a joke and drop it, they've joked around with this stuff before, and to be honest, Empire's the number one prankster/memer/whatever else matches that on this server, so don't be surprised if he throws a joke like that
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:54:49 Hell, I fucking suck at acknowledging jokes and I know that's a big joke
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:55:05 Now goodnight, please just leave it be
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:55:40 Vent about it all you want in <#497142796961054721> , everyone's probably with you on that one
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 06:56:04 Still, vent if it makes you feel better, I know it sometimes does, even with me, so feel free to do so, so long as it doesn't attack anyone
general 2019-03-16 12:17:36 RIP
general 2019-03-16 12:17:43 Oh hey Legendary, you're level 33 at this point, right?
general 2019-03-16 12:24:55 <@!163143541160148992> , Melee, mage or tank?
general 2019-03-16 12:27:47 I'm turbo grinding for Empire
general 2019-03-16 12:28:05 Let me just temporarily set it so anyone can join
general 2019-03-16 12:28:23 There, you can follow through my account now
general 2019-03-16 12:29:28 63
general 2019-03-16 12:37:41 Inferno, you in the server?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 12:38:25 AA turrets aren't illegal, they're just generally frowned upon
general 2019-03-16 12:38:53 You can join through me
general 2019-03-16 12:39:13 I'll prep a medium to carry you through
general 2019-03-16 12:56:31 Crap, sorry <@!274981740513198081> , my internet cut out, AGAIN
general 2019-03-16 12:56:42 Note for all: NEVER, EVER, and I mean __**EVER**__ use Comcast
general 2019-03-16 12:56:56 Sorry, just bail on that one
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 13:16:46 Dungeon Quest's the number one most popular game on Roblox currently
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 13:17:09 Plane Crazy's got the problem of, people are way too stupid for it
the-dump 2019-03-16 13:57:02 And incredibly lucky at the same time
the-dump 2019-03-16 13:57:16 It didn't detonate
creations-chat 2019-03-16 13:59:02 Done
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 13:59:57 Ehhhhh, that's a really iffy subject
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:00:26 Well, he's probably booted for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:00:57 Yeup, and I CAN NOT be asked to look through the mod logs to try to find him, because there's so many damn cases it's insane
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:01:41 I don't know, there's literally over 600 instances on/off on who was banned and who wasn't
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:01:57 And for the love of fuck <@!322259867643543552> , don't make me mash your face into a fine paste
general 2019-03-16 14:02:03 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:02:29 Hey, I didn't start swinging the ban hammer yet
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:02:38 And probably indefinitely, we REALLY need to clamp down on that stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:02:45 <@!461743274013753344> , The replicator rank was removed
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:02:59 Too many people kept on making real life creations
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:03:03 Which many found really boring
general 2019-03-16 14:03:31 I mean, dump enough stat points into melee and you can even one-shot Winter Outpost like that
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:03:39 Technically yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:04:12 He'll still get booted by the auto-ban system
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:04:30 So, we'd prefer not to, but if he somehow gets in without a moderator acknowledging it, it's on your head
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:05:58 Craft, we're talking about stuff that's gonna end soon
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:06:04 Henkku, it's probably permanent
general 2019-03-16 14:06:16 Dungeon Quest, yeup, although I'm busy testing game stuff
general 2019-03-16 14:07:04 I'm 64, Grab's 56, Inferno's 48
general 2019-03-16 14:07:39 RIP
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:16:46 I'm pretty much always responsive, even if it's a late response
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:18:13 <#544022464133595166>
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:18:31 Click on your name in the chat or on the right
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:18:49 Not a problem, whoever ranked you forgot to give you the "ranked" role, which unlocks everything else
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:19:06 So long as it applies to something in <#544022464133595166> , try to make it easier though
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:19:11 Not even that counts yousuf
creations-chat 2019-03-16 14:20:00 I mean, make sure the suggestions are good
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:22:45 .................
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:23:01 We put that stuff on a blacklist for a reason (Or, more specitically, V0xel did)
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:23:16 Whatever the reason is, we have a reason for doing so
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:23:50 They make our job alot easier
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:23:51 ..................
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:23:56 Guys
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:24:04 Don't make me start smashing faces
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:24:25 We do this stuff, __**FOR A REASON**__, more likely than not for a very good reason
general 2019-03-16 14:25:17 The fuck!?
general 2019-03-16 14:25:21 That's like infinite damage
general 2019-03-16 14:25:53 Ah
general 2019-03-16 14:26:02 I've gotta try that on a solo run
general 2019-03-16 14:27:00 Infact, I'm gonna do so, if that's actually a thing, then holy crap
the-dump 2019-03-16 14:27:32 This is a dump for pretty much anything, so long as it follows the rules
general 2019-03-16 14:28:40 RIP, <@!274981740513198081> , He's lying
general 2019-03-16 14:28:48 It's not lag swapping
general 2019-03-16 14:28:50 That's something I can do
general 2019-03-16 14:28:51 Probably
general 2019-03-16 14:34:16 I just tried to do the glitch
general 2019-03-16 14:34:25 Still taking a break from Dungeon Quest for now
general 2019-03-16 14:34:54 If you hit a wall, shout for me
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:35:11 <@!228115104061849612> NOW he's unmuted
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 14:44:47 <@!530774331081621504> , You already have it
general 2019-03-16 15:04:37 Want me to help?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 15:07:14 Easter egg
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 15:08:23 Engine easter egg
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 15:11:13 What's it from actually?
general 2019-03-16 16:17:37 G4M3, if you can, save that for Imperial
general 2019-03-16 16:17:39 It's destiny
general 2019-03-16 16:17:54 ?
general 2019-03-16 16:18:17 Level?
general 2019-03-16 16:18:30 Yeup
general 2019-03-16 16:18:54 2 heal sprays (Although I'm using one), 2 holy circles (Prone to causing lag)
general 2019-03-16 16:19:07 Wanna join me, Imperial, Orange and Grab?
general 2019-03-16 16:22:00 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 16:28:11 I mean, it's not the WORST I've seen
general 2019-03-16 17:20:34 I have when I micro-manage my stuff too hard
general 2019-03-16 17:20:51 You probably used a move AS you were replacing it
general 2019-03-16 17:26:48 High/mid level stuff and pure luck
general 2019-03-16 17:30:24 Lots of stuff, sorry
general 2019-03-16 17:30:43 PFPPFFFF, yeaaahhhhh, the game does like to kick you around a bit
general 2019-03-16 17:30:47 Wait till you meet nightmare Winter Outpost
general 2019-03-16 17:31:14 Let me just try to murder Bloxburg and jump back in, because this, CAN NOT stand
general 2019-03-16 17:32:37 I don't think so
general 2019-03-16 17:32:47 There's no way a 25 robux game will amass that many players
general 2019-03-16 17:35:11 There's no way it could amass such a high number of players
general 2019-03-16 17:37:21 Imperial, as soon as Dungeon Quest surged to the front page, suddenly they nearly doubled their numbers, isn't that suspicious?
general 2019-03-16 17:37:47 At least, I swear they doubled their numbers
general 2019-03-16 17:40:00 Yeah, I'm suspecting they're using bots, hacking their numbers (Doubly so since they aren't actually appearing on the front page), or are otherwise illicitly inflating their player count and likes/dislikes ratio to be more appealing
general 2019-03-16 17:40:48 I mean, Jailbreak did that and they got completely shunted to the side, same with the Jailbreak ripoff and like 5 other games
general 2019-03-16 20:05:29 Empire, join a server, I think I've got something for you
general 2019-03-16 20:05:51 Or, shout for me when you're ready
general 2019-03-16 20:09:40 Alright, shout for me when you're on
general 2019-03-16 20:11:16 Probably 1, want me to help?
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:17:05 Don't try that again
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:18:02 ..............
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:18:30 ?ban @Beretta#0001 Trying to evade a punishment for NSFW
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:18:34 God freaking
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 20:18:59 Daily reminder: Don't do NSFW, or end up like that guy
the-dump 2019-03-16 20:24:31 If someone tries to evade a ban, they're not honest people, and if they leave especially after getting a warn, which is limited for the time they're in the server, they're especially dishonest
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 20:48:49 Ah, you notice the tag, thanks for that
general 2019-03-16 21:03:44 I'll join through your account, or you join through mine?
general 2019-03-16 21:04:04 Alright
general 2019-03-16 21:25:39 We're in
general 2019-03-16 21:34:40 <@!340543153922768906> , Feel free to do so
general 2019-03-16 21:34:44 I can carry these guys
general 2019-03-16 21:42:26 Wait I think we got split
general 2019-03-16 21:42:31 Ah, well, they could follow through you
general 2019-03-16 21:42:40 Yeah we got split
general 2019-03-16 21:42:50 <@456226577798135808> Join to our server
general 2019-03-16 21:43:30 Ah, should we go without you?
general 2019-03-16 21:43:38 Alright
general 2019-03-16 21:58:26 Welp, that's as good a time as any, seeya next time
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 22:48:57 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 22:49:16 Must be 500+ blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 22:49:36 Show it working as intended as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 22:50:19 I mean, the inventor part only needs to apply to the specific part, you just need to show something with that mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 22:50:34 500+ blocks, design a mech or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:26:07 OOHHH! <@!217336009455566848> , I KNOW WHAT THE GUY TWEETING MEANS!
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:26:35 What he means is, are they allowed to browse and copy their raw data, before pasting it into Plane Crazy to load it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:27:00 Sorta like some of those flash games with the import/export feature, so they can do it across accounts and across computers
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:27:49 If you could somehow implement that, that'd be a really nice feature for various people, although you'd need to implement a failsafe to prevent people from messing with these in order to condense a ton of super rockets into one spot
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:28:01 What?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:28:10 The heck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:28:36 Ooookaaayyyyyy then
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:30:57 I have no idea
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:31:06 Just some laughs I guess?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:56:28 .....?
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:56:42 __**IMPERIAL**__ DEAR, FUCKING, JESUS, OW, FUUUUUCK!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:56:59 LEGITIMATELY MY HEAD IS STILL BUZZING FROM THAT
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:57:07 Also, I seriously doubt it, probably just motors glitching or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-16 23:57:10 Or mouse controls
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 01:19:37 <@456226577798135808> Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 01:31:35 Excuse me for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 01:31:38 Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 01:31:54 Or that works to
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 01:32:38 I'm going to take a break, you guys manage the chaos, and remember to not bash people's faces in too hard
general 2019-03-17 06:47:42 Overwrote a save on a modified version of my little turbo tank, wasn't quite as painful as it seemed, but then again it was a 100+ part modification to an already existent and already saved 250, maybe 300 part tank
general 2019-03-17 06:51:03 It's a damn nice ship to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:22:56 <@!454809803223465984> , There's a way to prove someone's under 13 easily, in the upper right corner, it says whether the person's over or under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:23:13 If it's not a +, it's underage, so you should ask them to show that from now on
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:25:05 It can already be done via motors, which, while they are glitchy, they aren't THAT glitchy
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:25:12 Hell, I've done trim myself before
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:25:45 Well, alright fine I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:26:45 Alright fine I removed the first one, but I'm gonna still keep it on the duplicate one
general 2019-03-17 20:27:18 ?warn
general 2019-03-17 20:27:21 Remove it, now
general 2019-03-17 20:28:26 Also, <@!242650210583576576> , Next time, __**LOOK AT SUGGESTIONS TO SEE IF YOUR SUGGESTION WAS ALREADY MADE**__, I can tell you didn't because you duplicated the same exact thing twice
general 2019-03-17 20:29:02 No, but I'm a giant advocate for free speech, so you can like whatever you want, as long as you don't harass someone else doing so
general 2019-03-17 20:29:18 Also I'd rather not say why I asked you to take it down, just know that there's a reason to
general 2019-03-17 20:29:37 ............. The only thing I support about the game is the apparent fact tha-
general 2019-03-17 20:29:38 EMPIRE!
general 2019-03-17 20:30:07 Anyways, the only thing I support about the game is the apparent fact that the creator's a giant nature conservation guy
general 2019-03-17 20:30:17 ............
general 2019-03-17 20:31:21 <@!242650210583576576> , For the love of fuck, I just bluntly said, the only thing I support is the nature conservation, that's it, I don't care about anything else from the game, and I hate battle royales in general
general 2019-03-17 20:32:13 ............. Are you honestly an idiot? (Sorry, I'm in lethally serious mode now)
general 2019-03-17 20:32:42 You literally just spelled it out, and you're asking me how to spell it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:42:48 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:42:55 Fucking hell ........... Remove that, now
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:43:41 I want him to get the damn point
plane-crazy 2019-03-17 20:46:33 All of you cut it out, now

plane-crazy 2019-03-17 22:54:26 He's banned for one day
general 2019-03-17 23:05:45 <@!340543153922768906> , Spend 1 upgrade in them to see how much they upgrade by
general 2019-03-17 23:05:52 Then do the math from there
general 2019-03-17 23:38:34 Agreed, ground slam's better than gale slice (Barely, and even then I'm not sure), but arcane barrage is so good
general 2019-03-17 23:40:49 I've tried it, it's HALF the damage of Arcane Barrage
general 2019-03-17 23:41:02 And in nightmare mode, which is pretty much the only mode that matters, the more damage the better
general 2019-03-17 23:41:11 <@!326460241048895489> , <#495286269459300364> exists you know
general 2019-03-17 23:41:27 Thank ye
general 2019-03-17 23:43:11 It's actually the best move in the game, even level 80s use that damn move for DPS
general 2019-03-17 23:50:03 Warrior wins for DPS, mage can heal
general 2019-03-17 23:50:20 A mage/tank is actually ludicrously powerful
general 2019-03-17 23:50:37 Legendary, Gale Slice
general 2019-03-17 23:50:43 It's a move that turns warriors from melee to ranged
general 2019-03-17 23:51:04 Trust me, it's the most powerful move in the game currently
general 2019-03-17 23:51:42 If you're really struggling, temporarily go mage, but be ready to swap back to warrior as soon as you get 2 gale slices
general 2019-03-17 23:51:55 Aka: Keep a warrior weapon handy, but don't upgrade it
general 2019-03-17 23:54:48 It's actually easy to swap over
general 2019-03-17 23:57:31 Just takes gold to swap
general 2019-03-17 23:57:53 At level 65, it takes 86K gold, which actually isn't alot, considering I get 86K per run from insane mode, let alone nightmare
general 2019-03-17 23:58:19 True, but still, it's probably the only swap you need to make from there on out
general 2019-03-18 00:05:34 Nah
general 2019-03-18 00:05:47 I use different armor sets and 2 weapons
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:06:02 Huh, interesting facts to know
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:06:27 Oy, none of that on here
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:07:20 You okay?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:07:33 Aaahhhh, huh
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:08:00 RIP
general 2019-03-18 00:34:26 Probably upgraded

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:35:23 You, guys, do realize, you're in the other games channel, and not wind tunnel, right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:35:32 Okay then
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:35:41 Huh, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:35:50 Welp, alright
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:36:17 Oh no wonder, wind tunnel has like 8 times less bitrate
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:36:29 Probably to suit it's larger size
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:37:02 I think Voxel set it to that, dunno, not gonna nudge it incase he screams at me
general 2019-03-18 01:06:22 What level are you?
general 2019-03-18 01:54:55 Ah
general 2019-03-18 02:02:00 Roblox should show my server if you go to the actual Dungeon Quest "servers" list
general 2019-03-18 02:02:15 There, fixed it
general 2019-03-18 02:30:10 I'm turbo grinding nightmare now
general 2019-03-18 02:31:10 Want me to join and help you turbo grind?
general 2019-03-18 02:32:12 Can't join, gonna manually find your server
general 2019-03-18 02:32:42 Nevermind, that's an idiot's idea, dear god just the 5 seconds I tried gave me a headache
general 2019-03-18 02:40:46 I'm helping Legendary out for a brief moment
general 2019-03-18 03:10:18 I'm gonna take a break

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 16:16:35 Probably set it to insane turbo speed just to test what happens when you run out
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 16:16:43 Er, let me rephrase that
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 16:16:56 Rick probably set it to that turbo speed for testing purposes, he'll likely change it when it actually releases, right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 16:19:43 -Suddenly mods and admins takeover the chat-
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:10 For the love of, let me clean up your previous pictures
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:24 Duplicates have been cleaned up
creations-chat 2019-03-18 18:09:42 Read the pins in <#478584971670454284> on how to suggest

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:39:59 ....... <@!280370489619251202> , it's going to be toggleable, not an absolute requirement
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 20:41:26 Don't expect it around forever
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 20:56:22 <@!392049134141571072> Don't try it
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 20:56:53 Kratos, with Rick, it's a joke he's a- wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 20:56:56 That's a fake ping actually
general 2019-03-18 22:36:32 Welp, someone patched the health glitch
general 2019-03-18 22:37:51 You could get pretty much 500X the amount of health from it
general 2019-03-18 23:10:00 I can micromanage healing and tanking, but not DPS as well without the glitch
general 2019-03-19 01:43:51 Was mage buffed?
general 2019-03-19 01:46:05 Meh, melee DPS is still better then, dual arcane barrage
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:51:10 <@!429665143677255681> Hey
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 02:51:51 You got all your ranks back <@!429665143677255681>
general 2019-03-19 03:08:27 Well, that was fun
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 03:08:48 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 20:26:23 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:40:44 Probably harder than it seems
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:41:08 This is Roblox, not Robocraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:46:50 <@!252094891448860673> , Don't forget you still need to maintain some degree of professionalism
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:47:43 Notice how I never altered my name? (My tag, definitely, but my username? Nope, and I swear if you change it now I'm gonna be a bit mad [Note: Jokingly mad])
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:49:10 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:49:26 OH FOR THE LOVE OF, FFAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:49:48 Fixed, Vooxeeeelllll!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:50:18 Welp, Voxel changed his username as well
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:50:38 People constantly beg for stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:50:39 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 21:53:15 To be honest, nobody's tried copying me, because either they've struggled too much with the game to even think about copying me, I catch them early and call them out for it, it's too massive (For the Dragon and greater), or they don't HOPE to copy how it handles
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:08:09 I think he's just trying to make a point, not sure
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:08:31 **Okay, point was made, guys, cut it out**
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:09:13 Pfff, I find it funny how you two were about to go nuclear
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:09:17 That's probably rule 1
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:09:36 No idea
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:09:40 Some are more nebulous than others
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:10:10 You want a tank, they're hilariously effective
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:18:19 I mean, Voxel, it's sorta the technique I use, where I present the info publicly
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:18:28 That way nobody accuses me of being wrong
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:18:43 Ehhhhhh, true
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:19:15 <@!429665143677255681> , What do you expect with Roblox tools?
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:24:00 The problem is that it doesn't merge with the map correctly
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:24:03 Although, hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 22:24:09 There's an idea actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:24:14 I mean, at least we have context?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:26:37 Let me just clean it up
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:26:46 Because, yeaaaaaahhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:26:48 Cool
general 2019-03-20 02:28:05 OH WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH OY! <@456226577798135808>

general 2019-03-20 02:28:54 I said BOTH OF THOSE, INCLUDING THE ONE IN <#495286269459300364> !
general 2019-03-20 02:30:39 <@456226577798135808> We need to make absolute sure Rule 2's enforced, otherwise some smartass may think we're running an NSFW server, report it to Roblox, and oh look at that, Plane Crazy gets taken down
general 2019-03-20 02:30:57 And we get alot of smartasses coming and going through this server on a daily basis ...
general 2019-03-20 02:32:25 You likely got smashed above or under the map and see the spawn border, or it's the skybox glitching out, because Roblox literally has a sky BOX around you
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:34:40 The guy's already left the server <@!511080180966752256> , so don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:34:53 He posted a potentially NSFW "meme", so I warned him, and he immediately left
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 02:35:01 I added a note to re-add the warn if he comes back, so he can't escape it
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:36:26 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:36:33 <@!348743059783155716> Don't think I didn't see that
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:37:18 ....................
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:38:15 Quit talking about highly suggestive stuff ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:39:02 I saw the first thing, we have mod logs you know
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:39:08 Not to mention you kept on suggesting stuff STILL
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:39:40 Oh you know what I mean FFS!
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:39:59 And if you don't know what I mean, you'd be better off not knowing what I mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:41:21 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:41:39 So what the fuck's going on here?

plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:42:30 To put it nicely, he said "Sign my rear", although it's not in my nature to break someone's face the very first time
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:42:38 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:42:51 It was NooBaris
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:43:14 The music bot usually stays in ASMR chamber, unless it's something special
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:43:27 Like a server-wide party or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:44:33 ..... Oh hey there <@!202959294705041408> , what you said is coming back to bite you in the ass, what'd you say about me during nik's warn?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:45:00 <@!348743059783155716> , if it's related to the game, you can post it, if it's not related, please put it in <#497142796961054721> , if it's just a random meme, <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:45:09 Okay seriously though Grab that actually is hurting my ears as well, ow
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:45:34 Colonel, I warn people for a reason, so don't call me a "headass" got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:45:38 Not bad nik
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:46:04 ............... Number 1 excuse from people that break the rules: "That was a joke", or trying to turn it into a joke
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:46:42 ............. Yeah no that doesn't sound like a joke, but, whatever I guess, I swear I ne, <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:46:51 Okay that's prooobably enough
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:47:40 There we go
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:48:11 <@!340543153922768906> , Once you're back and/or finished with whatever you're doing we'll unmute you, but as it stands dear god, whatever you're doing in there's very noisy
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:48:46 It's not really typing, I can tell the difference between a mechanical keyboard and hitting wood
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:49:16 Just lots of noise that was irritating some people
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:49:42 Company I guess
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:50:23 ... I mean, I'd say "That'd go in <#497142796961054721> ", but meh, we've been more flexible and gentile about that rule, so sod it
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 15:50:40 In my honest opinion, that looks more like a muscle car
plane-crazy 2019-03-20 17:42:20 It's actually somewhat impressive to make a sphere of those sizes, if for nothing else than the sheer fact that we can't smooth out certain edges with the parts we have
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:17:22 Wait, what do you mean by that?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:18:02 So, basically, all turret movement is tied to a single motor instead of a motor per turret?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:18:13 Wait, even elevation on the turret!?
creations-chat 2019-03-20 18:19:24 I'm gonna discuss it with the others

plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:42:22 There's a thing called taking a joke too far
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:42:45 And quite frankly, you've driven it so, so far past the line, that you should feel lucky that I haven't outright kicked you two
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:43:08 Now then, quit harassing people, quit posing shit as jokes, and quit being assholes, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:44:18 Now then, if I have to come back and break your faces, I will make sure they can't glue it back together, but play nice, and ACTUALLY joke, instead of posing harassment as jokes, and I won't have to do so
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:45:11 Do you mind toning down the damn volume?
plane-crazy 2019-03-21 00:45:17 It's actually hurting my ears

plane-crazy 2019-03-21 21:21:25 They're only funny for people that are literal leeches on society, namely because (As a metaphor) they're trying to kick pretty much anyone that can be kicked

plane-crazy 2019-03-22 18:41:20 Just how is it funny exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 18:42:10 <@456226577798135808> I think you need to get alot of good music while a few admins/mods are on

<@!202959294705041408> You have cylinders that will fit it perfectly fine, and I see you using cylinders, you don't need to make a PVP viable vehicle if you're going to add crazy aesthetics to it
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 18:45:53 Try to refrain from those, they're a bit, "touchy"

plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:25:14 .... <@!454809803223465984> , We have reason to believe that you're the one leaking the VIP server link
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:25:37 We have reason to believe so
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:26:11 .........
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:26:50 fungamer, let him post it, if it's his server, he's responsible for any crapstorms
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:27:06 For the love of fuck ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:27:17 <@!454809803223465984> , Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:28:34 <@!454809803223465984> Either tell all the idiots in your server to stop leaking the VIP server links or so help me you will loose access to Mee6 and any future VIP links
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:29:33 <@!454809803223465984>  We have ample reason to believe you're hoarding and spreading the links, converting the VIP servers into common public servers where a generic shitton of idiots keep on messing everything up
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:30:13 It's already gone ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:30:34 <@!454809803223465984> , Simple fix: You actually take responsibility in your server and quit leaking the VIP server link to people
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:30:54 This isn't funny anymore, we had someone drop a lag bomb in the VIP server multiple times and crash people
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:31:15 Someone in your server has the VIP server link, and they never joined this server
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:32:05 So freaking interrogate them, how the fuck did they get it, or so help me you will loose membership to any and all VIP servers due to safety, and plenty of issues in the past that are still recurring today at a relatively high rate
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:32:58 I don't think so, I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:33:20 All I know is, either he, or someone else, is leaking the VIP server link to others in his server
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:33:42 TL;DR as far as I understand, it started because you weren't banning those people, I'm not involved in it however, so don't ask me about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:34:23 <@!202959294705041408> , Cut it out before I mute you again, random emote spam's still __**SPAM**__
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:34:48 WHAT CONTEXT!? YOU JUST POST THESE THINGS RANDOMLY ALL THE FUCKING TIME EVERYWHERE
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:34:59 And it's genuinely really annoying at this point
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:35:33 ... That's not really a valid excuse to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:36:50 Right, back on topic, <@!454809803223465984> , figure out who's leaking the link to the VIP servers, and if you're the one leaking the link to people, stop it, now
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:37:16 Otherwise you're going to be the one taking responsibility and punishments, due to the fact that you're, to put it as simply as I can, the face of your server
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:39:19 I don't dish out warns, mutes, etc, unless I absolutely have to, or it's getting to extremes
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:39:32 Theoretical example: You start spamming out moon emotes nonstop, I mute you
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:39:37 No idea, I'm not leaking it
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:39:51 It's fine Troll, take your time
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:40:21 Just please, make sure to get rid of whoever's leaking, or stop leaking yourself, this is a major security issue, and we have had people completely ruin VIP servers before
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:41:24 Got it, thanks troll
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:41:34 And do remember: Now that you know, you're responsible for being ontop of this, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 17:42:23 <@!335599526414909451> , We're probably gonna do that
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:01:14 <@!429665143677255681> On it
general 2019-03-23 18:03:50 <@!335599526414909451> , I can verify, it's the highest degree of inappropriate possible short of posting a picture
general 2019-03-23 18:06:33 ?warnings <@!335599526414909451>
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:02 Jailbreak is grindy without rewards
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:08:18 Still not worthwhile
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:29 Back, perfectly
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:40 Let me see
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:16:49 Hold the hell on, let me get context first
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:17:33 ............ Give me one reason why you shouldn't be tempbanned, and it'd better be a damn good reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:19:00 You used it after Voxel told you to stop it ...
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:19:12 And Voxel doesn't get involved unless it goes too far
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:19:25 Now then, get the piss out of our server and actually grow up
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:19:58 I analyzed every warn he had, they're all valid
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:22:26 Alright, calm down guys, everyone's got their own personalities
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:25:24 Making a note on the new channel, nobody panic
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:25:53 Note made
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:26:02 Or, not
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:26:31 TL;DR, Not Safe For Work, such as standing on chairs, sparks hitting bowtorches, etc
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:26:39 <@!331490905846448129> PLEASE DELETE THAT!
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:26:58 <@!331490905846448129> !!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:27:10 CUT IT OUT!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:27:25 NSFW warns are still valid, it's just that the NSFW channel is a joke
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:28:53 <@!274981740513198081> , It's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:29:01 <@456226577798135808> Rules still apply, god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:29:25 <@!221496030355521536> , it's a joke that some of the staff members wanted to enact
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:29:37 I can roflstomp nightmare <@!274981740513198081> , although give me a moment
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:30:07 Welp
general 2019-03-23 18:31:17 I'm not sure, I don't think so?
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:33:15 Pretend it didn't exist
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:33:27 It caused too much panic, even though it was just a joke
general 2019-03-23 18:37:03 <@!242650210583576576> Heh, bit too fast there
general 2019-03-23 18:37:35 I know, the bot can't differentiate though
general 2019-03-23 18:38:32 Not actually doing too bad, want another arcane barrage?
general 2019-03-23 18:39:13 I have
general 2019-03-23 18:39:16 It's brutal as shit
general 2019-03-23 18:39:57 On the easier difficulty, unless you have 8K health, you get one-shot by any of the boss attacks
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:43:38 <@!362351190618538005> , Fucking cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:43:56 I'm taking a stress break, don't mind me
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:44:05 There's plenty of tanks, so sorry, but no
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:44:59 1 expired, it is an NSFW warn, but I'll let it go
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:45:18 If he starts being toxic again though I'm going to beat him with his own spine
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:46:59 That's why I'm going to fucking stab him if he tries to be toxic
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:49:10 ............... Let me just,
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:49:32 <@!362351190618538005> Don't DM stuff constantly for the love of fuck
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 18:50:07 Also, <@!362351190618538005> , You're on the thinnest of ice, got it? We won't accept trying to evade a ban by going right on the edge of warns
general 2019-03-23 18:50:50 Yeah, in terms of Dungeon Quest loot, G4M3's pretty amazing to be honest
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:03:14 Then don't try it
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:22 ?warn
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:25 Delete it, now <@!335599526414909451>
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:11:50 No euphemisms, period
the-dump 2019-03-23 19:12:02 ... __**NOW**__
general 2019-03-23 19:21:46 I've got 5 spare
general 2019-03-23 19:23:45 I'm a hoarder, what can I say?
general 2019-03-23 19:24:07 Also I help alot of friends in Winter Outpost
general 2019-03-23 19:27:32 Probably
general 2019-03-23 19:27:56 Hey, I have a ton
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:52:32 Aircraft catapults aren't that impressive to be honest
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:56:08 Something entirely new, that has a non-niche function, that isn't fulfilled by other objects
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:57:22 Folding's a good example, back when that was introduced, it allowed much larger builds to be made
Magnet drives allow extremely high powered crafts
So on and so forth
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:06 There's like 3 billion walkers, and not the gyros either, those have been made before as well
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:40 Still counts as magnet engines
creations-chat 2019-03-23 19:58:48 Unless they're THAT much stronger than normal magnet engines
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:00:38 Oooohhhhh, there's an idea
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:00:52 I got an idea for inventor, but I'm not sharing it
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:01:04 Yeeeeeup
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:02:39 I think so
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:02:55 If you can think of it within a day, someone's probably already thought up of it
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:04:33 They made a mechanism that actually acted like a genuine piano, even striking the corresponding string
the-dump 2019-03-23 20:10:25 <@!343927284819820556> Change your PFP if you don't mind
the-dump 2019-03-23 20:10:59 ....
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 20:12:13 Nostalgia I guess
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:00 Alright, here's an idea, nobody's ever built a physically adjustable on/off mechanism
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:23 Like, an ACTUAL switch or button that you press, using your physical character in-game, to toggle something
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:27 I don't remember what I built to be honest
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:36 Not like that
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:16:45 Think of it like a switch to turn on a fan or something
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:14 A switch, in-game, with motors that are either always on or always off, that you can adjust using an external force
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:30 Example: Building a hand, to flip a switch, to "turn on" a fan
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:38 And being able to turn it off as well
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:17:54 I can imagine a mechanic to do so infact
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:18:06 Not just a button Empire, that's actually probably a harder thing
creations-chat 2019-03-23 20:18:12 Probably a switch would be easier
general 2019-03-23 20:41:58 Give me a moment, going through stuff
general 2019-03-23 20:42:33 Wait
general 2019-03-23 20:42:50

plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:26:28 It won't hurt us to pluck another little weed out
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:26:32 ........... Right that's it
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:27:22 Ping me if he pops on again
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:27:27 Or if anything else  happens
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:28:16 Pro, notify all co-workers that he was banned from the Plane Crazy Discord for being excessively toxic, then ban him from that server
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:29:19 Now if someone else starts causing trouble, ping me, otherwise please try to not cause a shitshow, I'm really pissed off to hell with the mother of all headaches here
plane-crazy 2019-03-23 23:29:39 And yes I will be fine FYI, I recover fast from these things

creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:07:22 Also I didn't realize the red one was different, sorry about that
creations-chat 2019-03-25 04:07:32 Mind reposting the open one?

plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:16:38 DAMN, you're free to swear, but try not to do so excessively
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:18:15 Abdin, you did cause a pretty major problem, so

plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:18:51 Dude, cut it out, it's not funny
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:19:13 Mandatory question: How old are you, I'm legally obliged to ask
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:19:37 Alright, now act like it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:19:53 No, we definitely have had people under 13 slip into our server before
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:20:03 And I have (metaphorically) blasted their face off with a shotgun
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:20:23 ...... Excuse me? Would you care to repeat that to a mod?
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:20:46 It's not abusive because of rule 1 and 10
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:21:11 "Welcome to civilization" more like it
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:21:55 Abby, depends on what kind of elevator
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:22:19 The number 1 technique I can think of is alternating ropes
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:22:27 You can infact use motors, although it'd probably be complicated
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:23:58 I can think of just alternating ropes, but that one's also highly unstable
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 05:30:23 Alright, seeya
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:05:42 <@!370594904268734464> , We were culling alts and unverifieds that just parked onto the server to inflate the numbers
plane-crazy 2019-03-25 18:06:26 Basically, people who just joined the server, did literally nothing, and just sat there, likely either forgetting the server existed, or wanting to falsely increase the member count (Or people who lost access and stuff like that)

I've got little to no time to do so, and he needs to pick up gear for Gold, who, like the dumbass he is, sold off his only staff, after I gave him a wand that was out of his level, and clearly stated it was out of his level ...

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 02:42:40 Want me to go carrying?

help 2019-03-26 04:04:48 It's actually completely vital to making most creations work
help 2019-03-26 04:05:02 If it's in the way, then not to be rude, but you're building too small

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:50:58 <@456226577798135808> , You post your creations on <#504436696021204992> , and they'll automatically be ported over to <#384025409945337856> VIA bot
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:51:28 Baris, you don't need to AGGRESSIVELY say so, just go "She's 14, and she's looking for a date, maybe it's not the best idea to hang around her?"

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:36:19 To be honest, both need a buff, guns just plink off of multiple blocks of armoring or redundancy, while rockets are too slow and short ranged to really deal damage
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:36:30 Battleship, if that's a problem, then make a craft that can take off faster
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:36:50 Nobody's able to hit me if they only have ground facing guns because I just take off in half a second
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:37:07 People have tried that to, and completely failed
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:38:52 Trust me Battleship, it's not easy fighting at 600+ speeds
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:41:19 The Wyvern comes with a standard armament of 12 guns in a narrow/wide firing pattern, although it can be armed with a missile pattern with multiple hardpoint options
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 20:41:48 Also I can arm it with shelled bombs, missiles, etc as an anti-ground vehicle payload

general 2019-03-27 00:06:20 Had to bail, I saw the trade window pop up

general 2019-03-27 00:16:46 My face is just too good of a shield huh?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:18:08 <@!525548854959931392> , They probably aren't
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:45:48 He's some new level of dimented isn't he?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:47:34 Tell him, very bluntly "What you're doing is illegal then, because you're knowing breaking a legally enforced rule, within the Discord Terms of Service"
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:48:07 Then notify him that he's doing an illegal action by staying on Discord, even though he knows he's underage
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:51:27 I'd say tell Troll about it, ban him, and put this as the reason: "We are legally obliged to ban you if you're under 13, failure to do so can result in either you, or us being arrested, with serious fines and potentially even jail time, and this has infact already happened with someone who didn't comply"
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:51:45 I don't know if the "getting arrested" part is true or not, but it will scare the everloving shit out of him
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:51:49 Hopefully
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:58:37 Grab his ID?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 04:58:49 I'm gonna make him vanish, permanently
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:00:04 Integex, give me the message link?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:00:28 Find it and hand it to me
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:01:00 I need the message link to make sure he vanishes off of Discord for good, and I'll probably scrub his face off of Roblox as well through some contacts
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:01:28 I need it for this
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:01:39 Yes I did make several people vanish with my reports by the way, so apparently I have some degree of power
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 05:26:04 Voxel, mod stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:33:33 Desert temple has a level requirement of 27, he's the only one that has to apply to that one
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:33:57 Otherwise he's set the level requirement to 50s or above, likely because he's a lazy bastard who wants to be carried because he can't be asked to gather a semi-compitent team
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 18:37:31 Use variable strength thrusters and manually do it, sadly there's no other way to do so currently

plane-crazy 2019-03-29 04:00:58 ~~Aheherehm-coughcoughycoughcough-~~
general 2019-03-29 20:00:08 Integex, guardian call's actually bad for tanks
general 2019-03-29 20:00:50 A tank has enough health as it is to survive anything short of the demonic pirate's barrage attack (Or captain bullshit's side cannons), and it has a smaller effective AOE than the taunt aura
general 2019-03-29 20:01:24 Pulsefire though, that's the strongest spell in-game currently, at least for pure DPS (As far as I'm aware)
general 2019-03-29 20:02:58 Ironically enough, it's on-par with ice needles in terms of RoF (Not factoring in the startup or cooldown periods), and it's probably beaten by searing beam (ironically enough) in terms of shot quantity, but what it does have is a long, controllable duration of the highest damage per shot in-game (Plus ice needles are the highest RoF anyways)
general 2019-03-29 20:04:12 One funny thing though, demonic strike (The melee aoe move) may do more damage than pulsefire, as a tank with balanced stats (Aka: Everything invested in stamina), demonic strike scales exponentially compared to linearly, with a ~2.5K weapon compared to an ~3K weapon for pulsefire as the comparison
general 2019-03-29 20:04:30 With no weapon, it was demonic 5, vs pulsefire ~300
general 2019-03-29 20:04:37 (This is per hit by the way)
general 2019-03-29 20:04:57 With the respective weapons, it was ~2.5K vs ~2.5K
general 2019-03-29 20:05:25 Wearing their armors, it's 120K (Or something like that, I'm taking a hiatus from Dungeon Quest so I'm not double checking it) vs 20K
general 2019-03-29 20:05:37 Sorta seems odd doesn't it?
general 2019-03-29 20:07:24 So, I'd imagine pure melee DPS is __**STILL**__ the best in-game compared to pure magic DPS, just alot riskier since the effective AOE is alot smaller
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:26:08 <@473554619901935627> , That's a freaking tiny carrier, I doubt even my Wyvern could land on it
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:26:30 <@!404731699033931786> , check <#544022464133595166> more thoroughly
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:27:58 Ehhhhh? No offense but I doubt, considering you used so many beams, that it'd even count for midshipman
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:28:11 Although then again I'm just eyeballing it

creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:31:11 We do that for one specific reason: Under Discord's new Terms of Service, it's basically illegal for anyone under the age of 13 without parental permission (Nobody pays attention to the last part) to use Discord, and knowingly being on Discord against this, or allowing people on your server that don't apply to this, can lead to severe consequences
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:32:36 You need at least one of them to show your profile in the upper right of the screen
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:33:04 And do note: If you ARE under 13, say so now, and you will be allowed to come back to the server on your own accord, when you are 13 years of age or older
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:33:38 Well, alright, I'll give you that, do try to make an actually larger carrier though
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:37:24 It's fine
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:38:26 To be 100% honest, fuck Basewars, the creator went the way of EA, cash grab quantity over quality
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:39:06 And what pisses me off most is he literally doesn't care about quality, I showed him a video of someone deleting the map, with hammer tool in his hand, and he messaged me back going "I don't see a hacker here"
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:39:35 __***LIKE LEGITIMATELY, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!?***__, but yeah, I will never look at D4rk the same way ever again after that
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:41:01 I just want a good and popular air or space focused game, maybe with some amount of custom building (Don't get me wrong, Plane Crazy's amazing, but it does have it's limitations, then again it's alot better than most games)
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:43:09 Well, aside from the obvious (Lag, lack of high speed offensive weaponry, being pretty grounded to realistic builds), I guess there's no real sense of progression, aside from the player's own creativity and skill, which, while every bit of that progression is extremely satisfying, it caps off very quickly, and increases very slowly
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:43:48 ^
I would __***FUCKING KILL***__ for something like Avorion on Roblox
creations-chat 2019-03-29 23:44:04 Alright, good luck Hauserr
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:45:19 I'd literally buy robux or get a roblox giftcard to shove into that game as many times as I can (Barring 100 robux just incase I wanna buy something for myself like Cruise Ship Tycoon [Which by the way just entered beta today, and it's price is now 1/10th the amount])
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:46:59 I can cooperate with a couple of branches of mine, I'm helping to test for 2 groups
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:47:20 Er, not Roblox groups, I meant Discord groups that are making Roblox games, er, YOU GET THE POINT!
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 23:47:44 Not in the server, only Rick (and Madattak if he so pleases) can do anything about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 23:48:06 I think people just love pissing other people off with it
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 23:48:37 Even though ~~I've literally heard stabbing reports over these things~~ nobody really finds it funny
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:01 It's made by the same guy that made Retail Tycoon, soooo
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:19 Let me just pull up my store to show you
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:49:58 
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:50:13 With 600K money in that game, I can safely say I've spent way too much time in it, and the 25 robux I spent was worth it
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:50:40 If for nothing else, Retail Tycoon's a fucking fantastic time sink, while Cruise Ship? I can't say, I haven't played it, I don't have the money for it
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:51:26 I did have a pretty fun time showing some of my friends around in the game though
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:51:36 Er, not Cruise Ship, Retail Tycoon
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:52:23 My personal favorite's one I'm actually helping to work on, although it's not complete: https://www.roblox.com/games/1179993450/Skirmisher-Space-Dogfighting
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:53:02 Fun at first, but gradually wore off on me: https://www.roblox.com/games/2414851778/NEW-MAP-Dungeon-Quest
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:53:33 __**WAITING FOR UPDATES!!!**__, still hella fun though: https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752/Plane-Crazy-Alpha
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:53:53 And that's pretty much my lineup for favorite games
help 2019-03-29 23:54:13 You need to balance that, extraordinarily well Esio
help 2019-03-29 23:54:31 Like, nobody (That I know of/remember) have made a single and tail prop heli work
help 2019-03-29 23:56:35 That'd increase the power of the rotor
help 2019-03-29 23:57:44 I'm not good at helis, sorry
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:58:52 Hey, I have Terraria
the-dump 2019-03-29 23:59:13 God I heard that game is denser than a brick (Aka: Harder to pick up for new players)
the-dump 2019-03-30 00:00:07 You mean the Dungeon Defenders event?
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:00:29 Eeehhhhhh, it's just rocket and jet spam to be honest
the-dump 2019-03-30 00:00:40 I haven't tried it
the-dump 2019-03-30 00:00:48 Er, Dungeon Defenders I mean
the-dump 2019-03-30 00:01:13 Terraria I have, and the Dungeon Defenders event, well, we need another axis, because as it stands it is far too easy to just get a piercing weapons and drill straight through the line of enemies
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:02:44 Berrie, by modeler, we mean stuff like this
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:02:55 Stuff that __**BURNS**__ it's way into your memory with how awesome and unique it is
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:03:22 FYI yes that does fly like my Wyverns, and if you've seen those things fly you might be wondering "How the fuck does it fly so well"?
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:05:05 Again, meh, to get modeler, it needs to pretty much burn into people's memories with how awesome it is
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:06:00 __***PFFFF***___ ~~I expect to be a dragon person in that statue~~ Proooobably not, but who knows?
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:08:29 I mean, it's a bit, well, low effort to be honest
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:08:41 Compare it to this
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:09:06 Hell, with this
creations-chat 2019-03-30 00:09:16 Even these tiny suckers
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:10:53 Well huh, hey Rick, what ARE the RGB colors for the rope you made?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:11:04 Wait don't we have an eyedropper tool?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:34:47 Just CTRL+F the last time friction blocks were posted
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 02:40:33 Wait, what'd they do exactly?
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:40:18 I like the icebreaker (Cow catcher?) style bow
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:40:38 Looks wide enough for me to land on as well, so
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:40:44 OH! Guardrails, nice addition
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:41:03 Just from eyeballing it <@!506566804508770315> , I can tell it's carrier-worthy
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:41:11 And I've landed on alot of things
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:41:44 And hell, I've had to land on things with THIS thing
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:42:10 It's literally more than 2X your craft's size
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:46:13 Remember Imperial's mega carrier?
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:46:34 I meant the one he designed to try to lift up my creation
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:46:52 OHHH!!! I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE!
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:47:07 X-COM UFO INVASION, IT'S ONE OF THOSE FIGHTERS!
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:47:28 Er, interceptor, not invasion
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:49:50 <@!506566804508770315> Look!
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:50:32 I refuse to believe that you built that thing out of pure imagination, as cool as it is to see that thing be made
creations-chat 2019-03-30 06:51:36 There were a few other variants actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 06:53:38 From <#504436696021204992> , I think this is actually more like it
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 06:56:38 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 06:56:53 I doubt it, I've been taking a break from Plane Crazy because I hit peak with this

general 2019-03-30 21:46:36 The hell lego? Like, what?
general 2019-03-30 21:48:02 Got nothing, sorry Lego
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 21:49:31 Bisector and diameter are both math terms that apply to circles, however, the photosynthesis part is what really screwed it up
general 2019-03-30 22:01:07 Meanwhile I'm sitting here having basically retired from Dungeon Quest because I didn't want it absolutely eating up my life
general 2019-03-30 22:04:31 Welp, I can only guess how useless my tanking armor's gonna be now
general 2019-03-30 22:06:14 ?
general 2019-03-30 22:06:26 Huh, cool
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:15:52 Hooooly shit the framerate upgrade, so, this might need more testing, but basically I completely wiped Roblox off my computer, and when I reinstalled it, the framerate doubled
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:16:02 I shit you not
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:16:38 I basically wiped every trace of Roblox off my computer, and reinstalled it
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:18:59 Fallout New Vegas
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 22:19:46 I think the 3 most notable points are the mask, which shouts "New Vegas" (I think), laser rifle (In Fallout, they were always extremely boxy compared to other rifles), and the pip-boy (Because what other game has a nuclear computer on your wrist?)
general 2019-03-30 22:40:05 Aw nooo! RIP

plane-crazy 2019-03-31 20:09:20 ............... Guys, cut it out, let people like whatever they like and don't judge them for it unless they try to force it on you or something, you'll find that you'll be alot more patient with alot more people if you do that

plane-crazy 2019-04-01 02:57:56 I saw the fact that the plot was blue

plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:31:41 That's it
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:33:11 They repeatedly built inappropriate creations
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:33:39 Including: 9/11, "Nigg3r", etc
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:33:43 Send it to Rick
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:34:02 Post it here for us to review then I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:34:46 The person I just banned
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:40:34 Landing ontop of someone's plot? No
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:40:43 They can just turn on/off blacklist
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:40:56 I mean, depends
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 03:41:15 Well actually yeah, because they can just blacklist you, and they can just teleport over to their plot otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:44:35 <@!366469440474447894> Spamming will only get you noticed by the mods and banned, plus the bot doesn't work that way
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:45:19 <@!366469440474447894> __**YOU WILL NOT LEVEL UP LIKE THAT, AND I WILL STOP YOU IF YOU DARE TRY**__
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:46:02 <@!366469440474447894> I know that's a very blatant lie
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:46:44 Don't try it again, or so help me you're going to be set to banned, a level so deep below 0 that it never sees the light ever again, and only sees the eternal darkness of being locked out with whatever other filth we've thrown out
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:47:53 Daily reminder: DON'T SPAM, the bot doesn't consider your spamming to be anything of worth, and only meaningful actions will actually contribute to your Mee6 level, otherwise that's just seen as trolling, being obnoxious, and trying to flood the chat, and if you do want to continue spamming, mods have a nice and easy button to nuke your chat from existence, so nobody will remember you
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:48:32 ... Air, that's such a bad idea that nobody in their right minds would even consider that
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:48:53 To the point where I believe we've disabled mass mentions for all except the highest ranking people
general 2019-04-01 05:50:10 Here's how: Find something to busy yourself with so you don't get hooked back onto it
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:50:16 ....
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:50:22 <@!461743274013753344> Don't try to trick me
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:51:05 I react so extremely for a reason, and that's because larger reactions tend to shock people into burning the memory into their minds
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:52:37 ... To be honest I agree with Katze, show us your Roblox URL
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:53:47 ....
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:53:51 Katze, spy, just leave it to me
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:54:03 Show me what you get when you visit the Roblox homepage, with proof
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:54:49 There is Rover in the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:54:57 Show me this
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:55:36 I'm asking this for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:56:20 You have 4 more minutes to do so before you're accused of photoshopping
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:56:22 ............
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:57:11 You're lying as well aren't you? You weren't on mobile a moment ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:57:28 You have, until tomorrow, to show me multiple instances that you're over 13 years of age
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:57:41 And I mean MULTIPLE
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:58:21 Katze, we don't have concrete evidence on that part, so don't jump on that
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:58:49 I'm not, I just want things to quiet down, but little shits just keep on popping up and trying to ruin everything
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 05:59:34 So <@!461743274013753344> , Unless you want to be in the dumpster with them, I'd suggest using Safari, or whatever mobile app you've got, to capture and show proof that you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:03:34 <@!461743274013753344> , I'm not convinced
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:03:52 I requested that specific page in that specific format, for specific reasons
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:04:20 Only 2 times <@!486674992981999648> , so I'd prooobably let it go, although I'll keep an eye on him
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:04:37 And <@!461743274013753344> , seeing that specific page will convince me

plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:57:46 I don't give a damn if it's a fashion or not, wearing nothing can be a fashion, but that's obviously NSFW now isn't it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:58:58 That's sorta the point ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 06:59:59 .......... English, ever heard of it? I don't speak broken idiot
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 07:01:13 I don't give a damn if it's a euphemism or what, if it's NSFW, IT'S FUCKING NOT SAFE FOR WORK, which commonly the internet translates into inappropriate for people under 18 (21 in some places) to watch/view or otherwise experience
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 07:03:36 <@!478024687364997131> , If you want to post your god damn inappropriate bullshit, do it in your own server
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 07:21:56 Cut it out with the furry/anti-furry stuff please, I'm exceptionally tired and I don't feel like handing out mutes to make sure nobody throws a shitstorm down here
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 22:56:47 Fixed it

plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:41:13 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:41:29 Also, <@!217336009455566848> , it's because this is Roblox, what do you expect? People with intelligence?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:42:10 Rick, he was cycling warns, that's why
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:42:18 Although I think he took a hint, at least for now
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:43:48 I'd actually be interested in it, problem is how would these disasters go?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:44:12 Give us a general idea of how they'd go, otherwise I'd imagine that some people would be able to too easily evade them
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:47:28 Without specifics, I can't say, but if you could come up with some reasonable ideas (Earthquake, thunderstorm, acid rain, etc), I'll upvote it
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 19:47:32 Otherwise it just seems like clutter
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 20:20:24 <@456226577798135808> , his ban was supposed to expire today, it didn't proc
help 2019-04-03 05:42:57 <@!325866745921273856> , try multiplying that effect you made with the control surface
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:44:23 I feel like sponsored events should be downright murdered with a 12 gauge shotgun to the head of those unholy abominations, that are nothing more than disgustingly horrific advertising plastered onto a pathetic attempt at "games" for monetary gain

-ahemcough-, but yeah, seasonal events should probably stay
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:52:30 Right what's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:53:51 God fucking, <@511080180966752256> , we're doing alot of things right now and the mod applications aren't exactly the best, and can you please ease up on Orangeskii? He's in more of a serious mode than I am and he fucking had a horrible time, I'd rather not go into personal details, but let's just say it'd shit up anyone's life
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:55:30 So please, with jip, we're trying to sort out a good mod team based on the applications we get, it's trial and error most of the time, and we'd rather not have an error that wipes half the server
While with Orange, leave him be please, I know what it's like to have the level of pain he got recently, and the only reason I myself survived them was because I had someone to talk me out of it, so, at least for a week or two, just leave him be
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:57:04 Is he rearranging his server?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:57:29 Ah, call me superstitious, but I think I may've scared him off of Plane Crazy for a while
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:58:24 Whatever you want Orange, just try to listen to something cheerful
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:58:31 Ahahahaaahhhh, I have classes during the day
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 05:58:38 Also don't ask how I stay awake this late at night
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 06:00:06 From what I heard, start a new series of games alongside an already running series of games, upload both videos side-by-side with the same schedule, and it'll notify people anyways
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:00:33 Anyone __**ELSE**__, want to repeatedly troll me, on an HOURLY basis, via DMs? Feel free to follow that asshole
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:02:38 Do !servers in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:02:51 You can do it anywhere, but please maintain it in <#384027830192832513> for ease of access

plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:03:08 <@!227465821947953152> , you need a rank of some sort from <#544022464133595166> in order to access VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:03:27 Does it fly/sail?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:03:55 RIP, the thing is, anyone can build stuff over 2K blocks on land (Unless you imbalance it to such a horrific point that it topples over)
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:04:44 <@!486674992981999648> , More weight at the bottom, more helium at the top
<@!227465821947953152> Yeah, and? I built a turbo tank that can be scaled up infinitely that goes at speeds of 500+
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:05:23 Do some experimentation, see how many helium blocks/beams it takes to counteract a ballast block/beam
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:05:41 Then for every piece of ballast you put on at the bottom, put that many helium blocks at the top, you can paint them afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:05:46 And I mean the VERY bottom
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:06:33 I myself am actually not sure Katze, experiment yourself, add more if it doesn't float, remove some if it starts floating away
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:06:51 We've speculated the lifting strength, but we haven't actually gotten a concrete number in a long while
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:07:21 Not a problem, that technique is actually what most ships in-game use to maintain an upright position
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:07:49 <@!227465821947953152> , you just need to post a creation in <#504436696021204992> , and it'll be ported over to <#384025409945337856> , a mod SHOULD come around and rank it afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:08:09 If it's taking too long, or you're not sure if a mod will come along, you can feel free to DM me, and if I'm not in class, I'll give you the corresponding rank for the ship
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:08:24 No they didn't, we just specified engineer
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:08:36 People kept on building massive land based creations to achieve absurdly high ranks
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:08:55 While land is, arguably, the easiest type of creation to build
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:10:49 You get ranks by posting a creation that applies to one of the ranks in <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:11:03 Post the screenshot in <#504436696021204992> , use the little + icon next to the chat
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:11:30 You need to take a full screenshot in-game for your first one, including the upper right hand corner especially
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:11:34 Also hi Legendary
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:12:02 Sure
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:12:17 Oh, you must be trying to access <#384025409945337856> , not <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:12:33 <#384025409945337856> is the screenshots of people's creations ported over from <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:13:00 A bot automatically takes screenshots from <#504436696021204992> , and reposts them, alongside whatever message was paired alongside it, into <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:13:23 Ehhhhh, let's see it floating
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:17:28 Ehhhhh, it's __**SOMETHING**__ I guess, normally I'd bump up builds that are, BARELY at the next block count, but not quite (Example: Someone has 900 blocks, built an awesome creation, I might count it as a 1K block creation), although, ehhhhh, could use way more detail
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:17:50 Good enough I guess
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:19:54 Probably should get rid of some of the unnecessary ones, or make your own Discord server, just to index these things
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:21:18 I have an analytical brain that can calculate stuff horrifyingly well, ... when, I'm motivated to do so that is

plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:29:03 Rick, join through Katze, if it gives you the "server is full" message, shout for us
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:29:15 Shin, if Rick says it's full, leave, and Rick should follow right as you leave
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:30:25 I'm guessing the incomplete "fuselage"/body of the u-boat
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:30:44 ?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:31:46 Rick, start joining, ping me once you get the "server is full" tab, and I'll swap out with you
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:33:11 <@!217336009455566848> , Ready to swap out when you are, ping me once you start joining and I'll leave, what that should do is open up a spot, which you will immediately fill up, that way nobody else will accidentally fill it up
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:37:24 .... <@456226577798135808> Cut it out, or so help me you're going to be mass banned from the Plane Crazy Discord and game as a whole
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:37:36 Orange, leave it to me, your trigger finger's a bit sensitive
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:38:21 Then you can piss off our game and fuck off into the dumpster pile where you belong, because we don't need excessively toxic people here
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:39:01 "Or I could make the server more toxic as well" or I could just do this
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:39:32 <@!217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:39:40 Join through me, I'm gonna swap out asap
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:39:48 When you're ready, ping me
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:48:39 God damn it, at the very least after this can you tell Madattak to pick a staff member to be trusted with the in-game banhammer, at least ONE!?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 18:50:41 Oh whoah hold up, Madattak's highly against in-game moderators, yes I know that's confusing to grasp, but seriously, it's an uphill battle
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:16:49 I gave the guy a cold, hard look into a mirror and I think he realized what he became, although I'm not  100% sure
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:33:28 Very drifty?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:36:43 That's relatively easy to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:39:01 Meh, I've seen better, I've seen worse
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:41:14 It got demolished due to lack of usage and the fact that it's usage overlapped with the normal mods' jobs
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 19:42:51 I mean, probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:29:21 Ehhhhh, no thanks
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 00:20:04 A person who kept on joining with an NSFW PFP
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 00:20:15 They didn't get past the verification though
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 00:21:41 Don't ask
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 00:22:37 Er, don't, like, don't

general 2019-04-05 17:59:27 The major difference is the DPS they do

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:01:17 <@456226577798135808> How the fuck is the thing you DMed me evidence exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:02:32 That's not antagonizing anyone as far as I can tell, that's not annoying anyone, it's a highly opinionated topic, and for fuck's sake, it's certainly not ban-worthy under any and all possible rules outside of purely being a dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:02:42 And yes, I had to be blunt there, because there's nothing else that'll describe it
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:03:23 So either provide me with more, ACTUALLY VALID context, or I'll boot you with a tempban, and don't try evading it, Dyno can remember you even if you've left the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:04:53 TL;DR, <@456226577798135808> threatened to ban someone for nothing more than being extremely petty about an opinion that doesn't even MATTER
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:09:10 ............................... <@456226577798135808> Situation NOT dealt with because I've still got a ban hammer aimed at your face, now tell me, what the fuck  happened
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:09:35 Because you're at 3 warns, and I can and will easily bash you through a you shaped hole
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:11:37 ......... <@456226577798135808> , it's an OPINION, GET THE FUCK OVER IT
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:11:45 It's not even ban-worthy, HELL, it's not even WARN worthy
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:12:07 Now get out until you cool your damn jets, I've logged your roles so don't throw a hissy fit about that either
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:12:58 Sean, it's standard procedure to ban people who have gathered 3 warns for a day

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:13:24 Hold on let me find the list
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:13:52 
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:14:04 Anything over 1 month doesn't count
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 19:14:46 Hence why I tempbanned him
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:19:53 Prop master, Katze, I'm noticing you're seeing things as hostile, you doing alright?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:20:31 Look, I'm noticing a few near-arguments and stuff, what else am I supposed to think?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:21:35 Maybe take a break? Just sit back and watch?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:22:03 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:23:56 <@!313930200939233281> , Once you get to a point where you're satisfied, save
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:24:05 And do it often
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:24:19 Ah?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:24:36 Maybe you left too fast? I know alot of Roblox games have a problem where if you leave too fast, it doesn't save
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:26:07 Cockpit, save, fuselage, save, wings (with multiple saves in between each stage), save, hollow parts, save, color, save, mechanical parts, save, mirror, save
That's my sort of strategy
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:27:43 <@!313930200939233281> Thank Rick for that
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:27:49 Also I'm not sure Katze, might be
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:28:26 Looks more like an F-16 than a MIG in my eyes

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:42 These types of games feature their title updates in the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:51 As with Jailbreak and their vehicle upgrade
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 20:58:57 So why the fuck are they featuring an APC?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:20 The Just Cause series has APCs instead of tanks, but at least those things feel like freaking tanks
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:38 I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:00:41 I'm never touching that game ever

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:01:28 Yeah, at least that LOOKS like it's beefy

general 2019-04-06 17:38:01 Main issue is the community keeps on asking for harder skill-wise, when they're already beating their heads against whatever they're doing, and the creators don't realize that they're asking the wrong question entirely

plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:17:20 I am pretty sure you are going to flip onto your back and crash in a thermonuclear explosion <@!250393834817585162>
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:53 My computer can handle lag nukes easily
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:58 Well, semi-easily
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:22:13 I'd rather not share specifics
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:26:00 __***UHHHHH***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:26:46 Right right right right right, <@!486674992981999648> , <@!206891768233328640> , Uhhhh, maybe tone it back a BIT?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:27:00 Imperial no it's fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:27:19 Ehhhhh, alright fine, just not again, is that fine?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:29:40 Ask Roblox for that!
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:40:34 Uhhh, no, it's a bit, well
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:41:09 Just, try to be a bit more mindful please Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:45:30 __***EXCUSE ME!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:53:18 Ask Rick, I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:54:12 I've told Rick about it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 14:40:16 He already has them
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 14:40:29 They aren't that many, you can check yourself
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 14:54:29 ... <@!320682411459346442> , <#495286269459300364> For the love of hell

plane-crazy 2019-04-07 14:55:22 I've been annoyed, and about ready to (metaphorically) snap someone's neck, but otherwise I'm fine
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:03:55 Yes?
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:04:51 Done
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:14:10 Check your ranks again
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:42:53 Are you honestly serious you impatient little, .....
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:43:34 I'm the most patient and even I'm pissed at the multi-ping, and I repeatedly announce "You can ping me and I will eventually, but reliably get to it", you didn't have to ping 3 freaking mods just for one role
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:45:20 For the love of fuck, just take the damn conductor rank
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:48:08 See that, I'm fine with, give me time to review and I'll see if you apply for any ranks
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:48:35 Decent car, no ranks though
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:48:44 Wait
creations-chat 2019-04-07 17:49:08 Welp, welcome to the designer club
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:12:02 .............
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:12:16 It's fine, thanks for pinging me
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:16:03 ...... <@!530070109046308874> , I'm not in the mood, nor do I have the time to deal with this, so kindly stop, or so help me I am going to boot you from the server with no remorse
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:17:49 Automatic, this is because of a few legal issues, just do it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:37:32 Tell him to name the mod
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:38:22 Then say "You aren't friends with a mod unless you can name them"
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:38:50 <@!217336009455566848> For fuuuuck's sake, at least ban this one guy, Arman's spreading slander, intentionally attempting to crash servers, and is generally bugging every member constantly
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:39:49 The guy's Arman89132
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:40:00 He's the guy who did this ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:04:15 ?warnings <@!530070109046308874>
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:04:20 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:05:17 I know
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:14:59 You know what?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:47:33 Huh, that's actually a pretty nice design
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:48:33 He set them to limited angles and to reset
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:48:34 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:49:14 If you set it to reset, it should set back to it's original place as soon as you let go, provided you didn't set lock on as well
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:49:20 I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:49:50 "Realistic physics" (I could fly without a wing by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:50:26 I mean, true, I did literally do a Flex Tape level of cutting in half once and that thing still flew
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:50:42 It was a bitch to fly, but it still flew
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:51:08 -Cue flashback to holding A, strategically tapping Q and W, while also controlling throttle-
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:51:30 I think keels don't work sadly
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:51:35 And what do you mean by four wing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:52:01 AD for yaw, QE for roll, WS for pitch, ZX for throttle
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:52:39 As Orangeskii witnessed, I think yesterday, it allows me a pretty high degree of control
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:53:23 You probably have a different keyboard layout, mine's QWERTY
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:53:38 Roll is clockwise or counterclockwise, yaw is left/right
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:54:04 Wait seriously? How is that a nice layout then?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:54:23 Huh, alright
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:54:53 I use the layout I do because it's actually relatively intuitive to grasp, and in a pinch I don't have to scramble to remember which key does what
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:55:13 But I'm assuming it's worthwhile?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:55:32 Meh, alright, also G for landing gear because, why not?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:56:55 I wonder, competition idea: See who can shoot down my Wyvern during it's flight, ANY means necessary
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:57:49 I'd say that's racist, except I actually apply to both categories, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:57:55 Yeah fine that's fair
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:58:35 Gotta figure out a way to lob that into the air though Turismo, and don't forget I can simply just fly away from it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:58:41 I'm not gonna sit still now am I?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:58:52 Although, that would be a pretty cool airmine design
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:59:28 I'm actually pretty resilient to lag attacks, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:01:07 Actually, how about a more fair challenge
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:01:29 Try to take down the Asteria by any means necessary
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:02:02 Spoilers: It's actually faster and more maneuverable than the Wyverns (Only problem is it lags, at 1.7K blocks)
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:03:34 From what I know, ramjets are freaking strong as hell
creations-chat 2019-04-07 22:18:03 You post builds here, and if they apply for any ranks in <#544022464133595166> , you'll get a rank which will let you access specific features, and if ti's really good, it might be featured
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:18:36 Which person?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:19:13 Tell him "Copying a person's creation is bannable, and if you're found with my creation, Rick has every single right to fully ban you permanently from Plane Crazy"
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:19:15 Infact, wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:19:17 I'm gonna do it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:20:14 Ready, anyone wanna tag out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:20:53 ........
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:21:16 I'm gonna manually track him, <@!217336009455566848> __**GET DOWN HERE WHENEVER POSSIBLE PLEASE**__
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:22:15 I know Farollo
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:22:21 We don't ping Madattak no matter what
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:25:33 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:25:57 Yes, anticopy blacklist works by the way
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:26:28 Found em, someone tag out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:26:49 Someone tag out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:29:09 <@!217336009455566848> __***GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE NOW***__, we need this guy banned
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:31:27 He's hiding now
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:33:52 I notified Rick of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:34:03 Hopefully he'll pick it up and add him to a banlist
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:36:58 If you find him in your server, notify him that he's on a very short list to being banned unless he entirely deletes every single copied creation, and if he's caught by one of thousands of members, still possessing the same creation, he will be marked again for being permanently banned, at which point he will never be able to copy ever again
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:37:35 This user https://www.roblox.com/users/99281720/profile?nl=true
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:37:44 He's on again
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:38:28 He's not
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:52:09 Surprise him "You've already been marked for banning, either apologize to the original owner now, and delete any and all copied creations, or you, and any other alternate account through any other method, will be remotely banned some time between today and the next update"
The MOMENT he starts copying again, for now though, just pretend to not know who he is
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 01:37:20 Lego, calm the hell down, Imperial, just read the messages
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 02:11:11 Wings of Glory didn't care about exploiters for a while, then they started dying off, then they tried to grab back players, but no dice
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 02:11:30 Incase you're wondering I say that with previous evidence ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:17:56 Hmm? Is there a scifi-off going on or something?
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:18:49 I mean, it COULD use some outer details to be honest, at least something to break up the flatness
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:19:13 ~~That's the problem I'm having with the Asteria now, I need something for the gun pods~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:20:17 The problem is the aerodynamic layout's currently perfect, I might screw it up if I add more
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:22:18 I mean, maybe? Just some kind of outer detail would be nice for it
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 16:25:23 TL;DR Rick, we're doing a scifi-off and Black's getting a BIT mad at Imperial for criticism

plane-crazy 2019-04-09 20:42:33 Again, Dyno would PROBABLY break from that

plane-crazy 2019-04-09 20:43:33 Voxel, that's not permanent
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 20:44:40 Just doing "?ban (user) (reason)" gives this

bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:15:57 ..........
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:16:01 <@!529724212336918570> __**AHEM**__

bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:16:54 "Jk" nothing, how about I ban you then go "jk sorry"?
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:17:28 .......... If you only rolled in to make inappropriate comments, then I'd suggest you get out
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:18:00 Show me your Roblox webpage and the upper right corner of your playerlist in-game now
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:18:43 ........ Welp, you act exceptionally immature for being 13+
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:19:22 For the love of fuck, cut it out now
bug-reports 2019-04-10 02:19:51 Empire, if they get a warn streak, no length of a mute will teach them anything
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:29:33 TL;DR, he posted NSFW responses, __***TWICE***__ in <#498473314445033472> , followed by harassing Empire in DMs after being muted
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:30:12 Some dumbasses just don't fucking learn do they? At least not without a good bludgeoning to the face
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:31:34 I already relayed a message to Troll about the idiot through Empire
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:32:48 I already have a saltless ocean to bask in, I think I'm fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:35:53 Let's not fluff it up, he's a dumbass, do keep in mind he did this AFTER getting muted, and the mute reason was to prevent him from getting more warns, AND that was after he posted 2 NSFW responses ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:35:58 One of which was downright illegal
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:36:46 I'll just say I'm glad to be a shield for all the kids in here from that type of "person"

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 02:45:36 Talk to Ignacioel for transformers
creations-chat 2019-04-10 06:24:29 Ehhhhh, does the turret even move?
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 20:55:07 By the way <@!238017332872478720> , You got the rank
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 20:56:10 Well, if you need/want any other ranks, DM me and I'll get to them eventually
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:56:47 .... <@!242650210583576576> , Why are you copying? A quick glance and I can see that your creations are exceptionally similar
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:05 Just, the rotor design alone is something to raise a red flag with
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:09 This https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/565685594982711336/image0.png
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 23:59:25 I can see the fuselage is so damn similar as well ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:00:46 <@!242650210583576576> , The structure's the damn same ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:01:03 I don't care if you paint it differently, if the structure's the same, it's copying
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:02:04 Just, dude, Esio, they look so, fucking, similar, it can't be coincidental
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:12:35 ?warnings <@!242650210583576576>

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:20:47 <@!493945170757287946> , Only Rick has in-game power, because Madattak doesn't trust anyone else

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 05:23:45 Sam, for fuck's sake, I literally can look up the chat you know, nobody said any of that
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 05:26:37 There's a reason, he "left", that's because we kicked that group for either inappropriate names, alt activity or being afk for way too freaking long
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 20:03:51 <@!559162699741921300> , Who are you?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 20:04:15 No, they just tried to send a message out
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:26:31 I believe that's a Warhammer 40K fighter, is it not?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:27:03 Yeah, I recognize that Imperium of Man symbol right on the top of the nosecone, "Thunderbolt" sounds highly familiar to, as is the shape
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:32:05 Just, whatever, leave Integex in for now, if he starts causing problems, standard procedures acting as if he had 1 ban
the-dump 2019-04-12 04:33:53 Uhhhh, <@!328413257092169729> , Mind an audio warning next time? Legitimately, ow
the-dump 2019-04-12 04:34:40 I had to emergency mute my headphones, because even a volume of 2 didn't cut it (Then again my ears are extra sensitive, so there's that, but still it's pretty loud)
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:35:24 Turismo, how "massive" is it? Under 100 parts?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:36:08 I mean, "Tall", yes, "Massive" hell no
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:36:50 Makes me think of this thing, the Mechwarrior Mackie: http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/f/fe/MSK-5S_Mackie.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:38:06 Actually he could probably convert it to a Mackie, if he had any amount of artistic design, which he doesn't seem to have
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:40:59 It's gotta be unique and very distinct
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:41:22 Prime example that I'll keep on using of modeler-worthy:
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:41:35 You CAN NOT mistake a King Dragon for something else, at all
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:42:40 I mean, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:43:48 Integex, just, please don't start, I'm already shouting at the idiots over here for having an itchy trigger finger
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:44:11 <@!206891768233328640> Heeeyyyy, you got modeler
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:44:39 Now let me just fix your ranks Integex
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:45:44 ... <@!322259867643543552> , Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:46:41 That should be everything Integex
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:54:32 You know what? Fuck it, I'm gonna do a manual fix for Integex's things
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:54:35 <@456226577798135808> , Wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:54:43 It needs to be updated and refreshed

plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:55:16 ...... God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:56:05 I know it's not time for that half duration one to end, but fuck it, just kill it already
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 04:59:55 9mm isn't a cannon, it's a handgun round
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:01:10 PTRS-41 and Barret .50 cal anti-material rifles, both are designed to punch holes through even tanks
Or what about a 150mm railgun?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:01:34 (Fun fact, those are ALL real weapons that I've just mentioned, the railgun's still experimental though)
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:02:17 Hey, is that a Big Boy legendary?
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:02:33 Damn it
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:03:37 Well if we're going out the realm of realism, how about the BFG? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/doom/images/0/0b/Doom4_Codex_BFG9000.png/revision/latest?cb=20160601095100

plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:06:22 That's about 15 inches Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:06:26 15.7 to be exact
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:07:09 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 05:10:32 Alright now even I'm getting irked Zefus, cut it out, it's hurting my head a bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:20:45 <@!250393834817585162> , Too difficult to implement, it's a possibility, although that'd require something like F3X, except optimized for Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:22:22 Even worse actually, breaks a ton of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:01:09 Don't question it
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:01:24 __***DO NOT QUESTION IT***__, just, look at the freaking reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:05:38 We stomped this stuff down for a reason you know
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:07:22 <@!242650210583576576> , Not implemented anymore, you're late to the party
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:07:37 Anyone with Escape Velocity, Light Speed, etc, are all old ranks
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:07:55 If it isn't in <#544022464133595166> , it's probably not in use
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:21:01 <@557015565374455808> , Take to the air, he's got absolutely zero AA capabilities
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:21:37 Use something that can drop missiles on him (Just point them straight down)
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:22:14 Basically I just use a Wyvern with an outer/inner missile payload, switch on reverse thrust, hover over the spawnkiller's head and bomb him to crap
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 22:22:40 If he tries to use a turret, good luck catching something at 600+ speed with your guns
the-dump 2019-04-13 00:09:10 <@!551251673453166632> , That one's a bit, racist, let's just say

the-dump 2019-04-13 02:54:49 <@!412694102006824960> , Just show me what you sent to Empire
the-dump 2019-04-13 02:56:16 Ehhhhhh, as much as I hate to say it, Empire __***IS***__ in the right this time, technically, I don't know anything else, so I can only assume that, but assuming nothing else, he's in the right for that
the-dump 2019-04-13 02:56:44 It's the bottom-right frame that ruined it
the-dump 2019-04-13 02:57:23 FYI yes I got what he sent to me, only reason it's NSFW is because it's pretty damn blunt in terms of wording
the-dump 2019-04-13 03:13:51 .... <@302859025681350659> , Uhhhhh, that's a bit, uhhhhh
the-dump 2019-04-13 03:14:05 ....... You know what no, there's too many suggestive things in there

the-dump 2019-04-13 03:45:54 I will fucking gut you if you argue "It was censored" ... have some damn common sense for crud's sake
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:46:03 The hell is going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:46:33 ................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:46:45 Cut it out, now, all of you
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:47:16 Oh I'm going to deep fry your damn eyes if you don't cut it out Sam
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:47:38 ....................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:47:51 __***GUYS, CUT IT OUT***__, at least drag it to <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:48:14 Excuse me <@302859025681350659> ? I'm absolutely not entertained by that, at all
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:48:57 And nobody gives half a fuck about mutes, so how about you be quiet, before a little accident happens? Because I'm really tired of all the horrible meme vomit here, and I say horrible, for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:49:34 ................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:49:39 That won't help you <@302859025681350659>
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:50:01 And quite frankly no <@!433765344021053451> , although I can tell when some are bad
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:50:23 ............ <@302859025681350659> I'm aware of that, yet if you ignore me, well, there's a reason people don't do that to mods
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:50:43 Then don't try blocking me
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:50:51 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:51:36 I don't block people, __***UNLESS I BAN THEM***__, and that's only so I can gather notes on why they were banned
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:52:10 <@!163143541160148992> , That never works, you've already seen someone just go straight to DMs ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:52:55 And focuses it on one person, watch as he starts spam DMing me a huge list of bullcrap
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:53:15 I never mute because it focuses it on one person
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:53:41 Fucking TOLD YOU EMPIRE!
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:55:17 It's worse because people have just deleted messages before via DMs to frame me, at least in here we get action logs, and everyone can see what's going on ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:56:30 .......
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:57:17 .....
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 03:59:28 Zefus, don't, it actually is irritating me at this point, and currently my patience fuse is next to nothing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:00:06 <@!433765344021053451> , Rule 10 means we need to speak english, because it's hard to moderate otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:00:24 Otherwise we've gotta crunch it through some translator constantly, which may lead to inaccuracies
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:00:45 Chalk it up to people being absolute dumbasses constantly and trying to ruin everything
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:00:47 ..........

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:01:42 <@!191664513911750657> , you think anything that borderline breaks the rules is funny to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:02:03 Heh, <@!486674992981999648> , I __**HATE**__ having to use this power to be honest, but sometimes people just don't want to behave like actual human beings
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:02:51 Nice job Integex
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:03:35 Sam, you already did this foot kissing thing before (Oh shut up those with weird minds), and I didn't fall for it before, I'm not falling for it now
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:04:21 ...........................................................................................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:04:24 Just, cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:04:49 <@!368630214747619340> , Could you include a translation next to it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:05:23 Example, when put in Google translate: 
Веселые мальчики
"Funny Boys"
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:05:32 What kind of parakeets?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:05:39 All I know are budgies
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:06:11 I mean, you could use Google to look them up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:06:34 .... -Facepalm- Stridel, come on
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:07:01 Try shift+enter
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:07:22 Shift+enter lets you add multiple lines
Like so
In one burst
Just don't abuse it please
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:07:47 Anyways, <@!206891768233328640> , You can find alot of stuff online, as budgies are pretty common pets
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:08:53 Some things I will say are, DO NOT give them a cloth cover, if you're cutting their toenails, have something to stop the bleeding ready (Namely if you don't know how deep to cut), and don't handle them too harshly, birds have hollow bones after all
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:09:12 That sounds like animal hoarding Sam
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:10:07 Bad idea Katze, they might get their claws caught on it, although it depends if the blankets are smooth or not
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:10:43 The one my dad tried using caught one of my budgies' claws
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:10:51 Isn't that seriously uncomfortable Sam?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:12:02 I got 2 parakeets by the end of highschool, which absolutely sucked, because I'm barely there to enjoy being with them now
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:12:40 So instead of never having experienced having a pet, or having experienced a pet for my whole life, I got one for a BRIEF moment before I had to leave them

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:17:59 Thiiis is why I like birds, they're freaking puffy as hell, and incredibly soft
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:18:25 I heard that parakeets get lonely if you only have one
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:20:40 ....... Sam
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:20:51 Sam, <@!191664513911750657>  .............
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:21:03 I'm going to give you 10 seconds to delete that, now
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:21:05 Or, already done
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:21:35 You're right, it belongs in the incinerator, where nobody will ever see it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:22:12 Aren't certain foods bad for certain animals? Like chocolate for dogs? What's bad for birds like parrots?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:22:24 Not how it works Sam
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:22:43 If you want to swim in your own shit, make your own server, just don't invite any of us to it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:23:37 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:23:50 Also, <@!476629966780497931> , Everyone knows that, look at your Discord nickname
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:24:44 I can only imagine
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:25:52 Hey, it's a non-coaxial heli, those are pretty freaking rare ya know
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:26:19 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:29:26 Why doesn't anyone like performance these days? Especialy in ultralarge creations (Or at least, semi-large)
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:35:03 <@!476629966780497931> , Your Roblox name and in-server tag name are synched up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:35:09 Sure, VIP server 1?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:35:33 Oh, right, uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:35:43 I'll just join through you then
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:36:17 <@!322259867643543552> , it's sorta, too symmetrical I guess?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:36:28 <@!476629966780497931> , It censored it ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:36:32 ROBLOX, WHY!?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:36:40 WHY, THE FUCK, ARE NUMBERS, CENSORED!?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:37:29 ......... Ivan
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:37:38 I just said your in-server tag and Roblox tag synched up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:38:00 Wait I can join through that
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:39:27 None of the players in there allowed following, RIP ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:40:46 "User not found", god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:40:54 I think it only checks if they're on your friends list
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:41:37 I'd say yes, because 400 spellpower isn't that much when you have 20K+
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:41:59 He's giving you 2 scythes, which you can use for trade value and leverage, for 1 of almost completely equal power
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:42:04 Well, then again
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:42:11 He's offering so much for a REASON
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:42:31 But, ehhhh, I'm guessing a new map's coming out eventually
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:43:14 Level 75 over here, mostly from helping friends grind (And facetanking, my face my face my beautiful beautiful faaaaaace)
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:43:38 Seriously though, why does absolutely NOBODY play as a tank?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:43:45 It's the most needed role, and yet nobody does so
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:43:59 It's literally just tanking all the damage
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:44:01 No, not really
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:44:10 All stamina actually
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:44:17 Melee DPS is strength
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:45:11 Tanking is effectively gathering everything's aggro, and pointing them at you, so they beat you up instead of everyone else, so everyone else can focus on having absolutely zero health, but being able to wail on the opposition with absolutely lethal force
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:45:39 You can if you keep a translation to the side, I think
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:45:51 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:46:57 Yeup, facetanking ain't fun, especially when there's things that literally would blend everyone else in your entire party combined
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:47:25 (No seriously, more often than not, my entire party combined could get one-shot by the amount of damage I take in one burst)
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:47:27 Jade swords?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:47:52 Well holy fracking shit, save some for us will ya?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:48:08 Also PLEASE tell me there's a better taunt than guardian's call
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:48:15 Depends on what you're spending it on Sam
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:48:29 Probably not worth it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:02 Taunt aura?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:13 I already have it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:30 ... Fuuuuuck
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:37 Problem with taunt aura is I'm not shielded enough
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:46 Problem with guardian call is that the effective AOE is so god damn tiny
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:51 Like 80K or so
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:49:58 Also, Katze, it increases the more you level up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:50:18 Well huh
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:50:34 You fucking made off like a damn robber Integex!
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:50:43 Those are all end-game things
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:50:58 The scythes being the most powerful mage weapons (I think) in-game
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:51:04 Level 75, all points into stamina
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:51:10 I've probably quit for now though
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:51:23 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:52:03 Stamina in Dungeon Quest is directly tied to health
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:52:15 You only reecover health through spells, which is linked to spellpower
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:52:20 Strength is physical damage
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:52:28 Spellpower is magic damage, and healing power
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:53:08 Depends really, if you want to be DPS, you ought to specialize in a specific class, but if you want to tank, you can varry it up, dumping all points into stamina
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:53:39 Good thing I have a warrior kit standing by if I ever pick up the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:53:49 It's pretty bad admittedly, but better than nothing
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 04:54:59 Early game I'd say go for spellpower + a bit of stamina, once you hit Winter Outpost, melee DPS or tanking, Pirate Island, magic DPS or tanking, King's Castle, Melee DPS or tanking
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:12:35 <@!207319346635210753> , you don't post in <#384025409945337856> , you post in <#504436696021204992> , and a bot directs it to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:17:25 Concordes are pretty basic to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:26:53 Make something of your OWN design
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:28:21 Then tinker around until you've got something that works, then upscale it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:28:42 It's how I went from this humble ~300, 400 block craft
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:28:53 To this, monsterous 1.7K block craft
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 05:30:12 The way I work is: First, make a design, second, make the design work, third, tweak, shave off, add and augment pieces until it works
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:32:21 For the love of fuck, all 3 of you cut it out and let me judge it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:34:43 Right, Katze, please remain calm with these things from now on, you're a bit, easy to trigger
<@!508788110906097719> Can you NOT be racist and blunt? Seriously, saying "I don't like Japanese" is straight up an insult that even I take, and please just take constructive criticism and try to GIVE constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:35:19 You had a valid reason, "they made anime" isn't a valid reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:36:34 Just, cut it out guys, some of us would rather not have flashbacks of those moments
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:37:42 Back in Highschool, I actually met someone who was from WW2, I double checked and they're still alive
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:38:39 ..................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:38:45 __***SAM***__, cut it the fuck out
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:39:19 Whatever DRUGS you're on Sam, knock them off, seriously, only my damn uncle acted that high, and he was on mind-fucking meds at the time
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:39:35 Then quit acting like it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:40:32 You can do better
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:41:09 I have a desert legendary sword, and people tried to sell me purple Nightmare King's stuff for it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:41:51 I didn't catch the username because I had to go fast, but I didn't accept it because I thought I could get better, and apparently, seeing that, I was right
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:41:58 People are willing to trade mountains for collector's items
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:42:02 Even if said items are worthless
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:42:59 <@!508788110906097719> , What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:43:36 Also, <@511080180966752256> , one of my friends made a deal for, pretty much the same thing you had made that deal for, but with a Desert Fury instead
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:43:56 <@!508788110906097719> , That wouldn't be the easiest to make you know
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:44:41 -Cough- https://i.gyazo.com/09a9984a12560ca5d9995b9acea217ae.png
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:45:11 They weren't bullshitting, they sent me that
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:45:57 ... <@511080180966752256> That wasn't the only thing they got from the deal
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:46:52 Seriously Integex? You do realize that your staff of the gods traded for crazy value, right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:47:04 There's a reason such a shitty staff (Even as you put it) was put up for such high value
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:53:26 ...........................................
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:53:38 Erase this, all of this, now
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:53:58 <@!508788110906097719> , <@!486674992981999648> , erase it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:54:21 I don't say "Erase it" without a reason, ERASE IT THE FUCK NOW OR SO HELP ME I'M GOING TO DROP A BOMB ON THIS CHAT TO ERASE IT FOR YOU!
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:54:31 Right up to "Oh no it's someone ..." from Zefus
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:54:53 👍 <@!486674992981999648>
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:55:09 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:55:37 <@!508788110906097719> , you're clear now
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:56:33 <@!508788110906097719> , It's fine, you don't have to
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:56:47 Just up to the point where Zefus says "oh no it's someone who has never experienced animoo"
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:57:30 Bad idea Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:57:42 Last time I took 1/3 a dosage I got knocked out for an entire day
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:58:01 No that's bad, effectively 36 hours of being K.Oed
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:58:36 Okay no seriously <@!508788110906097719> , Stop
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:58:39 You're spamming up the modlogs
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 06:59:34 __**HELP!**__, but seriously though please stop <@!508788110906097719> , it is getting irritating to sift through
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 07:02:02 <@!163143541160148992> , Take over, but make sure to monitor the chat and not actually beat someone to death (metaphorically), especially if you don't need to
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 07:02:25 I need to sleep, otherwise I'm gonna drop dead tomorrow, now g'night
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 07:02:48 I am a male to (OR AM I!? [No seriously though I am]) and I've multitasked the shit out of multiple things, so if I can do it, you can to
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 07:02:51 Now g'night
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:05:42 <@456226577798135808> , <#495286269459300364> exists you know
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:02:23 Guys, cut it out, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:02:35 Just, whatever it is, drop it
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 01:07:01 <@!238017332872478720> , Ranks have been updated
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 22:07:42 It'd be me in this as well if I actually had something to actually swap out the fake guns with, sadly I don't
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 22:07:53 ~~Uber cannons when?~~
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 22:09:34 Heh, ehhhh I'll fix that a bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 22:53:52 How many blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 22:54:01 Oh wait, nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:29:59 The hell is that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:30:19 I know it's a spaceship, and I know it's from Galaxy, but what freaking class of ship is that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:30:53 I know what name it has Empire, what CLASS is it though? Makes Dreadnoughts look tiny
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:31:25 "Advanced dreadnought", seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:32:43 Galaxy is pay to win to the logical extreme
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:33:08 That's not even the strongest damn ship
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:34:32 Jesus fucking, nope, Rcouret has gone the way of the pay to win
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:35:40 Let me put it this way: Back in the version I played, you could pay for resources, which had to be used to build ships, alongside a price tag, you might wonder how that's pay to win, except the mega station had an abundance of all resources, right from the get-go
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:39:15 I'd say preserve it Katze until you can get another one
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:40:19 Knowing the tendencies of the people in Galaxy, mostly intentionally due to the creator (I remember he even bluntly tried to improve piracy in a patchnote one time), they'll just pick at it
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:42:54 To be honest, exploiting is __***SO DAMN COMMON***__ in Galaxy
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:43:28 I shit you not, someone literally added turret mounts at one point via exploits ... this was back ~2016, but still
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:47:04 I've seen people tweak their turret stats by the way, I decided to quit when a FUCKING WASP was shooting me with spinal weapons, very big ones mind you
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:47:33 I shit you not, someone did that to me in Galaxy ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:48:17 I remember when the Warlock used to have guns that could swap, so if you spawned and despawned your ship, you could get a Warlock with 7 railguns and 1 medium laser
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:48:33 Needless to say, that's what most people would do
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:52:32 <@456226577798135808> Completely wrong
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:52:43 Also that's a suggestion that's already been denied
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:53:34 Please, actually __***THINK***__ about your freaking suggestion before suggesting, about all the things it'd do, both intentionally and unintentionally
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:54:43 It's nice
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:54:52 Try something like this though
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:54:57 Unless you're using it as a camera for a flight sim
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 00:56:53 I mean, you aren't doing half bad, also you know you can force it to day time, right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 01:07:29 Galaxy, you repair ships by leaving them docked
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:50:49 What he said, and my response
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:51:36 I will forgive alot of things in this server, but should you try to bite the hand that feeds you, I will tear off your teeth and jaw in return
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:52:03 ... Okay maybe that was a BIT dark, but you get the point
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:52:40 It's less so "server has gotten more intense" and moreso "the primary Roblox populace has finally slammed into Plane Crazy"
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:53:14 <@!282630784928710657> , did you own it beforehand?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:53:55 Ehhhh, I'll believe you THIS TIME, but light speed's supposed to be discontinued
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:54:40 Yeup, no more lightspeed ranks except if you already own it
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:55:31 Done
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:59:36 Take a look at your ranks!
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:59:39 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:00:07 .... -Facepalm- I was a mod for quite a long time
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:00:30 Hey, Figors, I am actually online pretty often, it's just that sometimes I need to take a break from the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:00:52 <@!350773590213525511> , Nope
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:01:32 Just remember, even if I'm not in the chat, you can DM me by finding me in the user list
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:01:56 Just, try to not DM me just to say hi
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:03:37 Hmmmmm, I'll let another mod check, I'm not the most up to date on inventor stuff, plus it's supposed to be THE hardest rank to get
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:07:11 <@!322259867643543552> , Show it folding more than just a thin layer and we might be convinced
help 2019-04-16 14:08:37 ........ <@!314042613353283584> , Cut it out and leave Zefus alone if you don't mind, unless it's an in-running joke or something
help 2019-04-16 14:09:01 The problem is even if you block them, they'll just move onto someone else
help 2019-04-16 14:10:21 It's still irritating, we have <#495286269459300364> for a reason, unless these are inappropriate ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:11:05 Actually, better idea, trial by weight, use ballasts, alot of them Zefus, max their weight, and add it to the folding mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:11:17 If it holds, fabulous, your folding mechanism can handle alot of stress
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:11:21 If not, oh well, RIP that
help 2019-04-16 14:11:35 ....................................................
help 2019-04-16 14:12:16 <@!314042613353283584> , Cut it out, now, we don't encouraged people drugged up on memes here, if you want to share it, do it in <#495286269459300364> , but if it's inappropriate, don't just spam it in people's DMs, that can be seen as attempting to hide it from moderators
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:12:38 Fonkl, Zefus is able to fold a build, that much I can say for sure
help 2019-04-16 14:12:57 ........ It's not actually spam, it's just an expression
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:14:06 Look, in the video you can see the front half of the fold doesn't overlap with the theoretical back half, plus he/she could temporarily build a giant block to stress test it
help 2019-04-16 14:14:33 But that's aside the point, don't DM people your junk unless they voluntarily take it
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:17:35 I don't know if a block or a beam's more compact, all I know is that's alot of weight
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:18:05 ... <@!314042613353283584> , That's because they want a mechanism that doesn't rely on motors, since motors aren't exactly the greatest at glitch prevention
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:18:22 If you look in the video, Zefus set the block density to 10
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:18:32 But I don't know if that works or not Zefus, give it a quick test for us?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:23:25 I mean, it folds, it can handle a large amount of stress
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:23:31 Actually wait, one last trial Zefus
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:23:35 Put it in motion
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:23:54 Doesn't matter if it's side or forward motion, put it in motion somehow
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:24:30 Magnets might not be enough to hold it
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:24:54 Only one way to find out, attach helium blocks, super rockets, whatever, just LAUNCH THAT THING AT LUDICROUS SPEEDS!
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:31:13 Look, Zefus, inventor's supposed to be the HARDEST to get, meaning we're very strict on criteria for it
the-dump 2019-04-16 19:15:02 I originally didn't care about the "each time this is reposted" thing, but now it's downright spam, CUT IT OUT GUYS

help 2019-04-18 19:26:03 <@!350584348384428036> , SHOW ME EVIDENCE AND I WILL REVOKE IT, AND DESTROY PODO INSTEAD
help 2019-04-18 19:26:27 But until you show proper evidence, and I mean screenshots, videos, whatever, you're going to be the one under fire, got it <@!350584348384428036> !?
help 2019-04-18 19:26:37 Also that's not how it works Romek
help 2019-04-18 19:27:07 Rick's the only one with power for that due to Madattak not trusting anyone

help 2019-04-18 19:27:16 <@!351542650526236674> , he means BAN THE PERSON CREATING THE THINGS
help 2019-04-18 19:27:57 <@!350584348384428036> , WE KNOW, quite frankly if I had power I'd go in there right now and fucking use a guillotine on those fools, but without proper evidence, I won't just go ban-happy on innocent members of the Plane Crazy Discord
help 2019-04-18 19:28:09 So unless you have completely valid proof, DO NOT ACCUSE SOMEONE OF DOING SOMETHING THEY DID NOT DO
help 2019-04-18 19:29:45 I'm "mass" pinging you because you seem like an immature hothead who decided to go at one of our members for no valid reason, just because someone joined right after him doesn't mean he's responsible for it, I've had it happen where someone joins me right as I leave alot
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:34:37 <@456226577798135808> , You don't
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:35:08 <@456226577798135808> "Bro" nothing, the problem with that is people will just copy builds and claim them as their own
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:35:29 Then get better at the game, there's a natural skill curve on the building
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:36:08 "It would be like you'd actually have to put EFFORT in, oh fucking hell that's bad!" well excuse us for trying to make a good game
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:37:00 You get used to it very fast
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:37:17 It's sorta Empire's thing, he's not the worst though
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:38:19 Okay okay okay jokes aside guys, <@456226577798135808> , there's no sharing of creations because that just makes it so less skilled creators leech off of larger creators
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:39:19 .................. Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:39:31 Oh for the love of, <@!478669911573528580> , please include a translation alongside that
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:40:18 Oguz, do it yourself, otherwise you might wind up copying someone else's style that doesn't fit your own
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:50:26 .....
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:50:31 Right what's going on here?

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:51:45 Seriously Baris? Just, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:51:53 <@530800381794451487> , you don't unless it's absolutely vital
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:52:10 Prime example: "PLANE CRAZY GOT TAKEN DOWN!!!", that's a Madattak call
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 19:52:23 Anything short of that's not allowed
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:03:43 Oh for the love of, cut it out guys, it's a bit too heavy for this chat
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:05:47 <@!486674992981999648> , <@!263959626804887552> , both of you please cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:05:55 I don't care who started it, just both of you end it
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:14:44 ... Guys
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:14:55 Drag it to DMs please for the love of god
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:15:07 Also, Mega, it's the Roblox staff, the fuck did you expect?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:15:29 Someone literally posted a video that showed a server response time of over a minute before it acknowledged the acquisition of an egg
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:15:52 That's like 60K ping or something is it not?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:18:29 ?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:18:57 Bring it to DMs
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:19:31 Ah, I mean, unless you built it SPECIFICALLY to do that, it wouldn't be inappropriate
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 20:20:01 So if you built a robot that has fully functional fingers, obviously it's novelty is fully functional fingers, but a byproduct is it's able to flip anyone off
bug-reports 2019-04-19 16:21:33 Let me explain why: <@!396830889755017218> , download files can contain viruses, I've infact caught a couple, so please use some form of converter
creations-chat 2019-04-19 17:42:11 <@497121057678032896> , Just for that I'm deleting them

creations-chat 2019-04-19 17:45:32 ... <@!217336009455566848> , We have someone potentially making NSFW creations here, username: notchhill, he posted 2 with highly inappropriate comments, and left to evade warns, so I'm going to permaban him
creations-chat 2019-04-19 17:48:04 ?ban @notchhill#4451 Multiple NSFW comments, left immediately after being caught making one of those comments, I took screenshots of some prime examples

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 17:49:45 He made multiple NSFW comments, was highly racist, and left to evade a warn

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 21:31:24 If you look up anyone in here, you'll find their Roblox account

2: People would get the joke better if you properly edited it, and I'm not saying that just out of speculation

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 21:43:11 It's decent <@!280350654671880192> , not the absolute best, but it's decent
general 2019-04-19 22:11:32 <@!433382706143821834> , you count for expert designer, so well done
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:36:57 <@!486674992981999648> , back off, <@456226577798135808> , what the fuck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:37:19 There's an option to make explosive blocks on impact ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:37:44 Then are you in a PVP server?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:38:18 ......... I just realized
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:38:27 You enabled all variables, aka: Including "Press to arm"
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:38:41 For fuck's sake dude, <@456226577798135808> , you need to ARM THEM first if you have that enabled
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:39:32 ..... No offense but what the actual fuck did you think would happen when you enabled an option for "Press to arm"?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:40:06 Katze, just back off, you've got a valid reason to be aggressive, but you're going at it the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:40:20 If you seriously spent 1 week testing that and didn't get an explosive result, you're an idiot tymur, there's no real way around it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:40:30 ... <@456226577798135808> OY! STAY HERE FOR A MOMENT, WE STILL HAVE THINGS TO TALK ABOUT
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:40:56 First of all, don't insult our members for the love of hell, Katze's aggressive sure, but she was trying to help
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:41:01 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:41:22 Well, you don't bite the hand that feeds you, so if someone's trying to help, you don't just go "this server is trash"
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:41:45 We AREN'T YOUR SLAVES, and that's fine Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:41:47 .........
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:42:18 I'm assuming Katze was talking about jams, because you need to finely tweak an explosive barrel in order to make it work
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:42:39 Too much of anything and it can jam and explode, too little and it'll flop out like a sponge
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:43:10 Then you shouldn't have had a problem, and next time, don't say you spent a week on it, if you only spent a minute on actually making the block work
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:43:46 We thought you were talking about the bomb it's self, since you didn't specify ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:44:29 Oh fucking hell, next time be more damn open minded, and don't insult the entire server just because we didn't instantly bow down to your need
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:44:43 We're human beings to, so treat us as such
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:44:51 ....................
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:45:20 Katze, there is one point he got right, you are a bit aggressive from time to time, although I suppose that's within your power to fix
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:46:27 Thanks, I'll bug you if you start getting aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:48:22 Jeeesus fucking christ, give me his username? It sounds like flat out stalking at this point
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:50:23 I sent a thing to the Roblox staff, unlike other people, I actually make people vanish (No seriously my reports have made accounts get deleted before), so wiktor's going to go bye-bye for stalking
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 03:53:23 At least, hopefully he will, it's people like him that piss me off, stalking and being creepy for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 04:04:32 <@526036185836027915> .....
creations-chat 2019-04-20 04:16:01 <@!488404406350381067> , you get that when people upvote you, not when you demand for it
creations-chat 2019-04-20 04:17:43 For designer ranks, you submit a screenshot of your creation acquiring a certain amount of upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 04:23:51 Radscorpion, VATS it's eyes
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 04:46:08 You mean actually able to post videos there?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 04:46:25 Oh yeah, that, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 04:47:34 I did what I could, but the rest's pretty borked, sorry Integex

plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:01:02 Fun fact: I actually do
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:01:28 You tried using it as an excuse, but you don't act like you have it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:02:10 You tried using "I have autism" as a way to claim that you should be allowed to do these things
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:03:02 
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:03:21 If it's personal ID, I'm not taking it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:03:57 ................. For the love of fuck, <@!280350654671880192> , I'm going to give you one last chance to just drop the arguments and act like a normal person in this server, I'm not budging on any of those points
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:04:15 And just a screenshot showing you're 13+ on Roblox is fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:04:32 <@530800381794451487> , the bot does that for a reason, please don't
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:04:36 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:04:52 <@!280350654671880192> , if you can't provide proof that your current account is 13+, then I'm "sorry", but get out
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:05:18 If you absolutely want to, I will accept ID, but I will not accept fault for anything that happens to your ID
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:05:53 So if someone steals your SSN, do not dare blame me, or else I will literally draft up a restraining order on you
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:06:21 <@!249373398612967441> , Bad suggestion, think of how a 2X2 motor would work
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:07:53 Show PROOF, I can claim September 19, 1920, March 1, 2000, even October 14, 1951, but without proof, that may as well be straight up lying
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:08:10 <@!249373398612967441> , it won't center properly, that's the issue
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:08:57 If you don't know where, then either you're completely naive, or you're underage and just trying to avoid the question
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:09:05 It literally shoves it IN YOUR FACE
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:09:47 ...................
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:10:29 I'll bother you as long as you cause trouble in the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:12:10 Kayn, show it to me
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:14:34 That, is, __***FUCKING IT***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:14:56 THIS LITTLE DIPSHIT KEEPS ON HARASSING ME IN DMS, AND I'VE ABSOLUTELY HAD IT
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:15:47 I didn't have a valid reason to ban him until he did that last part
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:15:58 As soon as he started posting SHIT in my DMs, I got an excuse, and I fucking took that excuse
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:16:30 Alot of shit ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:17:08 Ah, he's deleted many of them, these were the only 2 I managed to catch
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:17:26 Little fucker knows how to clean up his tracks
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:17:33 Katze, stop there
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:18:05 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:18:17 Well, I guess since the context is fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:18:26 Sorry I'm just, very, very on edge here
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 18:22:41 You seem pretty good at the gundam Katze, try the Mechwarrior King Crab or Madcat next
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 20:57:29 .......... Didn't Rick ban him?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 20:57:37 I know he was banned from the server
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 20:57:47 For the love of, you're kidding me
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:01:30 Hopefully after what I did he'll be IP banned, or better yet, cease and desisted or even arrested for mass spam of NSFW things on a kid's server
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:01:36 Also, I'll check it out <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:02:20 Technically that's 6 blocks, close enough
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:02:54 <@!486674992981999648> , tell him if he doesn't stop now, I'm going to personally send these over my hotline to get him arrested for spreading inappropriate content on a kid's site
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:03:28 .... Excuse me for a moment while I beat his face into mush
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:03:43 It's wiktor ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:03:49 Or it's friends with him
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:05:59 "I don't care if it's an accident or not, cut it out now, and tell Wiktor to cut it out as well, I've got enough screenshots to throw you in for an extremely long time"
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:06:07 Yes?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:06:14 I ALREADY GAVE YOU IT!
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:07:40 For the love of god, Katze, are they still in there?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:09:03 .... "Wiktor, how about I arrest you to?"
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:09:10 Infact, let me follow through your account Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:15:09 Right, <@!486674992981999648> , you're clear now
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:15:22 If they start throwing a fit, I will hotline it to the authorities
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:15:30 Anyways, <@!351809528209080324> , you get used to Integex acting like that
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:15:46 He's a bit hard-headed, but he's not a bad person
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:16:14 ...............................
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:16:25 <@511080180966752256> , <@!351809528209080324> , BOTH OF YOU fuck off before I bash you both together
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:17:45 While we're supposed to disallow that, I think I'll allow it for those two, wii and wiktor are both fucking pedophelic at this point
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:17:56 And it pisses me off
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:18:00 **To**
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:18:05 __**DAMN**__
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:18:09 __***HELL***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:18:32 <@!249373398612967441> , a 2X2 isn't going to happen, we've discussed it, and that won't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:18:52 Because a 2X2 block won't center properly with the grid-based system we currently have
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:19:28 Alright then, script Plane Crazy from the ground-up and then tell me that
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:19:39 <@!249373398612967441> , what seems simple to you might be overwhelmingly complex to actually make
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:20:18 ........... <@!249373398612967441> , I already said that won't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:20:32 It'll break the centering and just act like a lopsided 1X1 motor
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:20:56 Katze, threaten him by saying you can send the screenshot to me
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:20:59 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:23:58 <@!249373398612967441> , you do realize that'll break alot of things, right? And that Rick's tried it before
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:24:22 What do you mean by piping?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:24:51 You mean empty pipes?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:25:13 Oh, so like bend curves and such
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:25:28 Yeah that's a good suggestion, although you ought to revise it to be clearer
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:25:33 Let me revise it for you
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:26:58 There <@!249373398612967441> , I optimized it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:27:22 With suggestions, be as descriptive and accurate as you can possibly be, the more fluff the better, but don't make pointless fluff
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:28:37 The more descriptive you are without adding needless fluff, the more people can grasp what you're trying to say, and the more accurate of a decision people will make, while also removing confusion as a factor, which may cause people to vote against your suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:29:21 Sadly not a good suggestion, for a reason I'll add to the denial of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:30:44 There, read <#507673335816126509> to see why I denied it <@!249373398612967441>
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:31:32 Don't forget, it needs to be PLAYABLE first and foremost
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:31:41 And if we get extreme levels of lag, it won't exactly be playable now will it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:32:35 ... <@!249373398612967441> , please double check if your suggestions were already suggested using CTRL+F
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:32:45 And please make sure to comb through every iteration possible of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:33:49 As punchy (and admittedly a bit rude) as it is, Katze does have a point, you don't seem aware of the full ramifications of what you want and/or are suggesting
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:34:12 For instance, 2X2 parts won't center properly, no matter how we've attempted to modify the system, unless they are the most basic parts out there
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:36:45 Not half bad
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:44:17 <@!249373398612967441> , think of how difficult it is to implement, and how it'd affect everything
creations-chat 2019-04-20 21:45:57 Scissor mechanism, nice Neutro
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:48:17 They aren't the worst, but they aren't good either
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:48:34 -coughsecondbuildcough-
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:49:16 Oguz, it's a functionality one
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:49:35 Okay okay okay calm down a bit guys we might be getting a bit aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:50:37 Guys, just cut it out ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:50:54 <@!486674992981999648> , <@456226577798135808> , Cut it out, you're both being aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:51:14 <@!435946988559925248> , <@511080180966752256> drop it, I'm here to work this out
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:51:29 .............................................. __***RIGHT, ALL OF YOU CUT IT OUT AND END IT, NOW, I'M GOING TO RESOLVE THIS***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:52:00 <@456226577798135808> , SHUT IT, that's not harassment
<@!486674992981999648> , I'll handle this
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:52:26 "Technically" 3rd actually, but just leave it be Integex
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:52:35 Kayn, we have good days, and we have terrible days, this is one of those
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:53:05 Oguz, while they aren't the worst, they aren't the best either, if someone says your builds aren't good, ask them why, and if they can give you a reason why, then they're likely valid
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:53:24 Yes yes we know Katze's aggressive I'm trying to help her (Yes, Katze's a her) out
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:53:58 Oguz, again, Katze's a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to help her with that
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:54:53 .... That was less of a counter-insult and more of just a low blow for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:55:42 A counter insult would be turning the person's words around to them, very simple mock example:
"You fucking suck dude" -person1
"Well at least I'm better than you" -person2
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:56:11 It's the biggest, least effective counter, due to the fact that it's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 21:58:10 It's not insulting unless you fit the bill
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:00:28 I mean, guys, to be fair it's at least got a decently designed fuselage, but it needs more variety
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:01:09 <@!255361087262818304> , bendy looks better in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:01:43 Oh god damn it, also <@456226577798135808> , I might be able to give better criticism
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:02:04 FFS, you'll get it if you listen to the criticism
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:02:25 Right, here's the thing, you used the same variety of parts, which overall just makes the creation look like a large version of that part
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:02:49 <@456226577798135808> , you need to diversify and use more parts, and use the parts you have in more interesting ways
bug-reports 2019-04-20 22:03:31 <@!514710786996961304> , did you disable RGB saving?
bug-reports 2019-04-20 22:04:06 RGB saving means that you can save custom color codes, but otherwise it defaults to a Roblox-set color palette
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:04:26 <@!249373398612967441> , I know, that's why I helped you optimize your suggestion
bug-reports 2019-04-20 22:04:52 If you enable it, you use ALOT more save data, but you'll also be able to save custom color sequences, just note again, ALOT more save data
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:05:26 They aren't in the server, so they won't get upvotes for it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:05:44 Oh for the love of god <@456226577798135808> , can you snap your eyes off of the role for just one moment?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:06:41 They might be, I'm trying not to
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:06:55 <@456226577798135808> , WHICH ADVANCED ROLE!?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:07:10 For the love of god, show me the part count
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:07:34 Then don't expect your role until you show me the count
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:08:11 <@456226577798135808> , I can usually estimate the part count based on a quick glance from multiple screenshots
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:08:48 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:08:56 __***ALL OF YOU CUT IT OUT NOW, YOU'RE SERIOUSLY PUSHING IT***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:09:11 For the love of fuck, let him grow and develop, don't just beat him into the floor
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:09:48 Even if he makes something terrible, don't just needlessly throw things at him, cite why they're bad and make suggestions as to how he can fix them
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:10:15 <@288499143956103169> , submit suggestions in <#384027830192832513> using "&suggest (Suggestion)", be sure to check if it's already suggested
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:10:34 <@!249373398612967441> , stop right there
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:12:56 You can't sadly <@!355123674954858496>
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:13:11 This is why you take pictures of creations from all angles, and keep those to yourself
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 22:13:17 That way you can rebuild them at any point in time
creations-chat 2019-04-21 18:05:29 Look at the underside, they're slightly different each time
creations-chat 2019-04-21 18:05:52 It's showing off the underbelly components
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 18:29:48 <@456226577798135808> __***EXCUSE ME!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 18:30:23 Not really Jail
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 18:31:33 That person was why I kept emergency permaban commands on hand
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:41:17 ........................
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:41:31 <@!249373398612967441> , quit suggesting things unless you can think of every single aspect of how they might be implemented
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:41:47 It's fine Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:42:54 You sorta indirectly did when you said "if we had (insert thing here), this would be much better"
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 21:03:54 Who said that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 21:05:01 I'll leave Blackbird to it

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:06:22 Definitely not <@530800381794451487>
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:06:36 Ah, have fun on vacation Rick!
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:07:06 That might be a bit harsh Kayn, but yeah, alot of people that don't get a rank USUALLY make bad suggestions, duplicate ones, or can't describe their suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:07:59 He didn't get booted as far as I can tell
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:08:38 .... Rick, is he DMing you because he's a special little snowflake that can't be arsed to read the actual rules, ranks or suggestions channel?
help 2019-04-22 19:08:51 Your thrust is below the center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:09:07 Different tag I think
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:09:45 Ah, just wanted to know because he said he was gonna DM you, since he couldn't ping you in the chat (Even though we TOLD HIM not to do so)

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:48:14 Why though?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:48:28 Ah come on, use it as a milestone
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:48:53 I mean, I saved my very first creation as a milestone to show "This is how far I've progressed"
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:49:16 If you ABSOLUTELY insist, I'll do so, but you'll still remain ranked

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:52:15 ........ Show me
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:52:39 __***SHOW ME THE FUCK NOW***__, ahem, if you can't guess from that, I'm highly anti-copy

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:53:20 Nuclear made something based off of my crafts
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:54:01 I'm going to see if I count it as copying, if so I'm going to ~~very aggressively with an M1911 to his head~~ ask him to make them more unique
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:54:21 Oh FFS are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:54:55 Innocent until proven guilty
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 19:57:02 I know
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 20:00:27 Alright <@!184819059404046336> , you're clear
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 20:09:45 It's supposed to be a joke, but yeaaahhhh, maybe tone it down a bit IiI
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 20:12:19 Ironically enough nuclear's partially right on that, the general community is bad enough that if you try to focus on people, you'll get dissapointed
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 20:12:34 I mean, is it against the rules to post a creation? Ultimately we've made general flexible, so if it's an SFW game, sure
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 20:12:45 Hell, if you want you can invite some people to play, I know I did so in what used to be general-2

plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:14:59 And this time, I MEAN LITERALLY AS IN LITERALLY
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:15:06 Hi Katze
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:41:22 Rick, basically some guy pinged both you and Madattak for literally nothing, and it was the same guy I told not to do so with
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:41:50 He just emptily pinged you both, then after people told him not to do so, he went "idc", upon which I promptly warned and banned him
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:42:02 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 19:43:03 <@456226577798135808> , nope

plane-crazy 2019-04-23 20:20:12 I'm not in the mood for jokes
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 20:20:48 NOW CUT IT OUT ALL OF YOU
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 20:20:58 I'm not in the mood to deal with jokes, and I WILL count that as spam
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 20:21:20 Just cut it out, I'm not in the mood to deal with these things
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:20:18 ... This again?
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:20:25 I'm not in the mood you two
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:21:07 By the way, you thought that was a gun?
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:21:09 That's not a gun
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:21:11 https://i.imgur.com/EaZiQTG.gif?noredirect
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:21:13 THIS is a gun
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:21:50 Fun fact: That's actually a real gun, the XM556 Microgun, it's a minigun designed for handheld use
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:22:47 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:26:27 Their goal's a single axis heli
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:26:31 Not a coaxial one
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:26:57 ... "Thank you" for what exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:27:33 It's a balancing act Tawo, ultimately it's up to you to do the final tweaks
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:27:50 ............ Can you two stop it before I put a restraining order on you both? I'm actually getting pissed off at you two and your antics
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:28:16 Then add more mass to a heli, take real life concepts to reduce wobble
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:28:48 I can't teach you, you need to teach yourself, but ultimately, google how real life objects remove the wobble
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:30:17 Tawo, it's not just helis that have an anti-wobble effect
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:35:16 To be honest I got bored because I had nobody to play with
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:35:21 And I was the only person playing as a tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:35:43 Imperial, that's all of Roblox, if anything Dungeon Quest has the LEAST amount of hacks compared to how popular it is from what I've witnessed

plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:37:01 Also Imperial, while that's true, they supposedly patched that out
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:37:29 You know what, for your own safety <@!191664513911750657> , I'm just gonna do this so you shut up, quit pissing me off during such a bad time and risk getting yourself warned
creations-chat 2019-04-24 02:38:40 ~~WHAAAAT'S THAT A COMPETITOR!?~~ Fairly decent build, although it could use a better engine design, the ones it has are a huge target on the frontal and side profile, but really nice job with the top profile
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:39:23 I'm not in the mood to grind off people's faces with a spikestrip, but I'm not in the mood to be bothered either
creations-chat 2019-04-24 02:39:48 I mean, if they're for looks, that's fine, although you shouldn't rely on them
creations-chat 2019-04-24 02:40:13 Infact I'd say have an off switch on them, that way if they're hit, you don't go spinning outa control due to the shift in thrust
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:40:30 Use propeller blades and/or motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 02:40:34 It works better that way
creations-chat 2019-04-24 02:40:57 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 03:15:31 Use common sense when suggesting, and read the pings, alright?
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 05:37:27 People have done so before
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 05:38:49 You probably shouldn't say "phew", because you missed out on modeler
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 06:37:20 <@!478024687364997131> , excuse me? The hell did you just post?

plane-crazy 2019-04-24 20:06:30 Also I don't care to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 20:07:14 I'll be fine, like I said
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 20:07:49 Also to be honest I do agree with Katze, seriously, leave me the hell alone Soulija, it's actually making my skin crawl

plane-crazy 2019-04-25 06:39:03 Yeah, censorship on that level may be a bit extreme to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 06:39:30 I gave Voxel a note for that

plane-crazy 2019-04-25 21:31:10 It was in a context that was as such, he could have said other things if he meant other things, but instead he went with that specific comment

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 23:39:23 I mean, you've seen how damn tanky I am, but still, it's sorta dissapointing that it got nerfed
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 00:58:12 Is, that a serious thing?
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 01:37:19 You can't, it's not a thing yet, and the difficulty of implementing it would mean that it's probably not coming for a long while

creations-chat 2019-04-28 02:53:52 It's fine, just, don't spam it up again
plane-crazy 2019-04-28 05:11:15 Unless it's a quote from an educational source that's in-context (Aka: We're talking about a historical event), with proper citation to said quote, it's not enough of a pass to get you out of trouble, and even then it's still a red-hot topic
the-dump 2019-04-28 20:15:35 Looks like it, https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/unturned-bunker/images/e/e5/ShadowstalkerMk2_1441.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20161028182212
the-dump 2019-04-28 20:16:03 I never actually got the Shadowstalker MK2, although that's mostly because I want to preserve my absolutely 0 deaths
the-dump 2019-04-28 20:16:59 Yeup, haven't died to anything (Although that's probably because I've avoided doing the special bosses and going to PVP servers, mega zombies being regular bosses in my eyes)

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 01:15:08 Either build a rig to drag it to the water (The old way), or use the options to spawn it at the water
help 2019-04-29 02:49:46 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, if I give you more info, you'll need to ask for help every single time
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:54:01 It's a server where we hang out and discuss Plane Crazy stuff, maybe do a couple of competitions, and suggest ideas to be implemented
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:55:06 Yeup, have fun, and please follow the rules, they're mostly human common sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 02:55:25 Yeah

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:02:53 Colonel, he's referring to the contest ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:05:53 FFS, Colonel, fucking turn on your brain for something more than just terrible "memes" that don't even deserve to be put in that category
Anyways, yeah <@!572249765417451541> , please use the iron cross instead of a Swastika, people get VERY touchy when creations have swastikas on them, like extremely touchy, instant temper tantrum levels of touchy
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:08:40 You don't make sense, at all, and it's really annoying when you try to butt in thinking you know *juuuust how to solve a problem* ||Spoilers: you don't||
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:11:18 Curly, 2 solutions
1: Stop playing PVP
2: Build better, my Wyverns are durable enough to take a couple of rocket hits, but fast and small enough to evade almost all projectiles
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:12:44 How good is it at avoiding hits though?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:13:47 Extremely fast and maneuverable (As many people know), and can jam power into it's reverse thrust in order to pull off unique maneuvers
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:13:56 And do I need to mention the damage capacity?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:14:36 That's the problem with larger creations, they're bigger and easier targets
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:16:19 Then counteract that by either going faster than them, or outmaneuvering them (Preferably both, which is what I do), and make sure to show your small target profile to them
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:17:19 Then outmaneuver them, so far I've not gotten downed even once by hostile attacks, even if they try to spawncamp me
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:22:30 Curly, try using a helium package for a rapid launch
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:23:11 Not to be rude, but who are you?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:29:36 Colonel, can you freaking cut it out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:29:44 It's not funny, it's damn creepy
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:29:54 For what exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:32:19 Then show us proof that you're in the server next video, or as an unlisted video, and if it's not from the same guy, then you're nothing more than a conning liar
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:32:46 And quite frankly I don't have to roast you Colonel, you do that to yourself on a daily basis with your own "jokes"
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:33:13 ..... There's no such thing as .50 cal pete
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:34:05 __***THERE IS, NO, .50CALPETE***__
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:34:22 Now SHUT IT Colonel, I'm sick of your freaky nonsense jokes
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:35:27 I'm just really pissed at Colonel's antics, hell, I needed to block him from my DMs because he's just that fucking creepy
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:37:06 There's some missing ...
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:37:58 Malicious, he deleted the proof already, what do you want me to do, fish it up from the realm of the erased files?
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 03:38:48 Just ask one of the other mods about how he fucking "obsesses" over me until I had to threaten a cease and desist (not literally) on him

the-dump 2019-04-30 03:52:30 No no no no, the worst part is designing half of it, then you can design the other half just fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 04:57:23 If you wanna make something work, act it out in real life, and think of every stage of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 04:57:47 It's close enough though
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 04:58:57 FFS, <#384027830192832513> is a thing, plus you got novice conductor, and novice ranks are really easy to get
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 05:00:18 Multi, we have an accurate enough representation of physics that we're able to mimic real life motions
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 05:00:34 Now try again, and I'll give you a hint: Legs don't rub against the ground, they push against it
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 05:00:56 Oh for the love of, right, sorry, it's still not impressive though, but whatever, just don't mess everything up

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:02:14 Oh hey Fun
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:37:27 Which direction to stabilize?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:39:54 "Boths" doesn't help, there's 3 main ways for a plane to adjust where it's facing
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:40:15 Plus no offense, but "both**S**"?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:40:18 ..................

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:41:55 If I had to guess you're pitching downwards
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 06:44:15 You're making absolutely no sense, what was the problem exactly? Actually describe it instead of saying random single fucking phrases that don't even answer the question I'm asking

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:27:44 I didn't mean he copied it piece for piece
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:32:50 Like someone trying to do an awful self-roleplay that nobody wants to hear?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:04 Also, I don't think so, you could try what steam engines do, but I'm not sure if that's possible otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:59 That's, not a bad idea actually

plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:37 Sadly we've batted this idea alot <@!249373398612967441> , and it'd be hard to script in
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:47 Namely because the selection area would be problematic
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:39 Yes, infact someone took it further and made a breach-loading rifle
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:29 Just think of how a breach loading rifle works in real life, then replicate the steps
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:59 Alot of people at this point, earliest I remember was Empire I think
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:42:25 .......... Colonel, why are you so interested in it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:43:58 Joey, the biggest cylinder available is a 3X3, but if you want to go bigger, use wedges of varrying degrees, the larger it is, the smoother it'll get
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:45:51 Joey, it's a simple act of wedges at different angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:46:03 Tinker around a tiny bit and experiment, you'll learn more permanent knowledge that way
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:46:37 Just note: The core of the wheel doesn't matter, whether it's beams, blocks or whatever, the core doesn't matter, it's the outer rim that does
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:47:50 RIP? Ouch
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:50:08 Joey, you can leave them open honestly
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:51:27 Next to impossible, you can settle for really smooth wheels, but not perfectly smooth
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:53:35 Sorry Joey, dealing with two major things at once here (This included), start with a flat surface, I'd suggest something like 4 long, then use a 4X1, then a 3X1 that's infront, but 1 under, then 2X1, 1X1, then flip the wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:54:56 Joey, scale that up and use larger wedges

plane-crazy 2019-05-02 23:51:18 .... <@!295246380547702786> , Keep that in the damn dump from now on
creations-chat 2019-05-02 23:58:53 ........... <@!325712842487627779> , They have done it before, it can still be done, physics hasn't been changed
creations-chat 2019-05-02 23:59:13 Maybe you should use actual controls or mouse based instead of something that doesn't work, you sure you actually know how to fly?
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:00:18 I could literally go for micro engineer right now if I wanted to, and probably get it within the hour
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:01:55 ... Is that an actual spoiler?
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:08 ?Warn
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:10 ERASE THAT NOW!
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:13 .... Oh
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:25 Fucking, sorry
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:39 I'm 
1: Mentally exhausted to hell and back
2: A bit trigger-happy when it comes to spoilers
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:02:49 We already nearly had a riot one time with a spoiler, and I don't want a repeat of that
the-dump 2019-05-03 00:03:01 I shit you not everyone was asking for one guy to get permabanned
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:07:05 Yeup, it works
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:07:52 .............
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:08:00 Ever thought of removing the back fin?
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:08:10 The thing causing alot of drag pulling it back?
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:08:52 Then I don't know, you did SOMETHING wrong
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:10:09 I don't care, it just needs to fly, even if barely
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:11:21 .....................
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:11:47 Can you quit being a lazy smartass? It's already there in the engineer role
creations-chat 2019-05-03 00:12:02 Just for that, no, I'm not giving you micro engineer
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 00:50:44 ........
creations-chat 2019-05-03 01:34:45 <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:56:14 Jesus fucking, <@!556913127917223967> , can you calm down? Seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:56:29 Right, what's the issue exactly, describe it in as much detail as possible
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:02 What do you mean by that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:18 Meme videos go in <#495286269459300364> NSFW videos are not allowed in this server, period
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:38 If you don't know what that is, you're probably fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:02 Terrains, probably not, it's probably just going so fast that the refresh rate can't keep up with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:23 ........... Can you please confirm your age? We need to ask for legal reasons <@!431335776144588800>
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:13 Show your Roblox page, the upper right corner of your Roblox game GUI, or some other way
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:32 Colonel, do you even know what you're talking about? ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:59:40 If not, then stay out of this
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:00:17 Yeah that's fine, I'm just asking because we've had a few suspicious characters act under 13 years old, who turned out to be underage, and thus using Discord illegally
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:12 Hey, Imperial's a good mod, so treat him like you'd treat me
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:29 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:02:47 I mean, are they in this server? If so, who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:03:08 Sab, FFS, wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:03:14 I think I know evan
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:37 .... Daily reminder, it IS infact __***ILLEGAL***__ to be on Discord under 13 years old, even with parental permission, so for fuck's sake guys, if you're under 13, leave now, the repercussions will hit all of us if you don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:41 Keken, show me
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:04:49 I'm going to track him down
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:05:32 More torque means more movement strength, which generally means more rotation speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:05:42 And yeah to be honest it is annoying <@!251995895405477888> , cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:06:28 What <@!556913127917223967> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:06:56 No, put it here
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:08:56 I mean, we already took care of the situation, if he adds more alts in, we ban all of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:09:42 ... <@!251995895405477888> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:09:56 Can you fucking not Tornado? It's irritating
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:15 ......... Do you seriously need us to answer such an obvious question?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:25 If you do, white part to the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:10:45 And again, if you do, I'd suggest you stop playing the game, many of the more awesome things require a higher degree of thought
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:11:59 <@!431335776144588800> , It's literally illegal for people under 13 years of age to use Discord, with varrying consequences for both the people aware of it, and for the person under 13 as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:12:46 ............. For the love of god, let me get a few things straight here guys
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:13:49 1: Parents permission or not, you can not be under 13 years of age and use Discord
2: Kids can be tried as adults
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:14:11 I was about to say "Nobody reads ToS", but if it's the first thing, they do tend to catch it
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:14:50 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:15:13 <@!184819059404046336> , That would mean that you're underage
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:26 You do realize that I'm n-
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:27 ............
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:36 <@!556913127917223967> , No
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:47 I mean, guys
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:16:52 It's HALF advertising, sorta
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:00 I will not confirm or deny that nuclear
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:08 Nah, only do those if they're REALLY toxic to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:26 Again, I will not confirm or deny that
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:17:47 I mean, maybe he speed read them?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:18:21 You do realize that that's a mod's job, not the other way around, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:18:35 .......... Wait is he seriously under 13?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:19:09 I mean, to be honest I'm skeptical as well, but behavior alone isn't proof
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:19:40 Also yes I do tend to have some sense of humor nuclear, it's just that today I got woken up by a fire drill, so I have an effective 4 hours of sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:20:13 I've literally met 10 year olds that act more maturely than my own two god damn parents
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:20:39 There's my answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:04 Just leave it be for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:12 Nuclear, shut up, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:26 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:47 God fucking, Imperial what did he do!? His last warns were 3 months ago, at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:21:56 .... Care to explain <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:22:25 Don't attribute the actions of one as the norm for all
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:23:17 .......... Right, let me start fixing this, <@456226577798135808> , <@!381263178589536257> , both of you stay out of this
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:23:32 First of all, a ban's too extreme, his latest warns were 3 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:24:19 Second, Cody, where exactly did you get that line? It seems __***AWFULLY***__ familiar, namely from a certain instigator who kept on making fights in the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:24:48 Nuclear, shut up, I'm in contact with him now
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:13 Felipe, not quite how it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:35 Cody, I have ample suspicion to do so because that's the exact phrase said instigator used in a very heated reddit post
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:25:55 Nuclear, just shut the fuck up already, you're causing nothing but problems, and I know if I mute you, you'll just go to DMs like anyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:28:24 Nuclear, I tend to mute people to shut them up for their own good, so they don't blab on into getting themselves a pile of warns with a side of banning
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:29:39 Yet if you've been around for any extended period of time, you'd know that they'd get themselves in a bad situation anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:29:50 At the very least at that point there's a chance for them to take a hint and stop
help 2019-05-03 16:31:36 There's plenty in the backlog, search up "Swashplate" and you'll find a bunch
help 2019-05-03 16:35:35 CTRL+F
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:36:56 <@!251995895405477888> , that should be everything, fucking hell I already have a headache from multitasking
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:37:54 Thanks Tornado
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:38:02 If you could send the screenshot over that'd be nice
help 2019-05-03 16:44:32 Can confirm, thrusters under vehicles causes a massive upwards pitch, think applying force to a giant lever
help 2019-05-03 16:45:29 Probably because he wants to make a unique  heli
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:47:36 Nope, Mig-19 wasn't WW2
bot-central 2019-05-03 16:48:21 <@178298325806743552> , You encountered the easter egg
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:51:49 Fuck a duck in the face with a mallet, there, your ranks are fixed Joey
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:52:53 I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:53:21 Oh FFS let me double check
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:53:57 Got it!
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:04 Er, as in, I fixed your ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:20 I was woken up by a fire alarm, giving me effectively 4 hours of sleep
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:25 Joey, I caught that as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:54:35 So yeah I might be a tiny bit pissy today, a "tiny" bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:55:05 I technically am because he owned the roles beforehand, so
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:55:19 Not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:56:11 -Insert sonic spring SFX here-
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 16:57:54 Yeah, blame Discord for that, take another pic?
bot-central 2019-05-03 17:12:03 "Grr"? <@!556913127917223967> , how fucking old are you exactly? Give me a straight answer
bot-central 2019-05-03 17:12:22 ......... Okaaaayyyyyyy then
bot-central 2019-05-03 17:12:56 He already did
creations-chat 2019-05-03 17:23:58 <@!391760734587060235> , pretty much anything that can fly, can land in the water
creations-chat 2019-05-03 17:24:16 Hell, even things that can't can float in the water
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:20:56 ... 1: You don't threaten me, or at the very least you don't say things in a threatening way to me
2: Next time shape yourself up and this won't be a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:22:37 That should be everything, I removed a redundant rank since you had one that was superior
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:23:16 Oh shut up <@!556913127917223967>
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:04 "im not" ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:08 Gerardo, be nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:24:36 ... Albert, you're not helping either
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:25:45 He claims to be, and has screenshots that show he's over 13
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:26:03 At the same time though you act worse than some 8 year olds I've met Albert ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:26:37 Gerardo, it's sorta about the maturity
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:28:20 We try to reset VIP server links monthly so whoever's leaking them won't have a valid link for more than a month
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:36:46 Don't think I got yours <@272125457703501826> , sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:39:46 Vixo, just send the screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 18:40:15 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 02:42:20 <@!559180331580915754> 
1: You need ranks
2: Already suggested
3: <#384027830192832513> for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 02:42:27 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:18:14 Tinker around, figure it out yourself (I say that mostly so you can benefit long term)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:20:37 Make one yourself Thunder, figure out how
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:20:51 ... <@456226577798135808> Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:02 Try that again, I dare you
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:48 We don't accept smartasses that don't read the rules, I'm going to pretend I saw nothing, and I'd advise you cut the crap
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:21:52 <@!559180331580915754> , Nope
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:22:17 Any ladder that'd fit inside a single block won't work, plus we have blocks that can form ladders on their own if placed correctly
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:23:41 Figure it out
general 2019-05-04 03:24:09 ... I'm on the verge of saying "Shouldn't that go in <#495286269459300364> ?"
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:24:31 God damn it, I'm trying to make him learn, that way he'll be able to figure out solutions on his own alot more aptly
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:24:56 Press escape and use that screenshot?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:00 It's fine Con
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:13 __***GOD***__ I'm tired
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:25:59 Here, have this https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/b/b4/1-Up_Mushroom_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png/200px-1-Up_Mushroom_Artwork_-_Super_Mario_3D_World.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:27:00 IRL it's probably poisonous as shit, but if you know anything about Mario, you know that these suckers are freaking gold
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:27:26 Maybe not as gold as these things, but still https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/a/a4/GoldenMushroomMK8.png/1200px-GoldenMushroomMK8.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:29:15 No idea, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:52:39 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:53:02 If you're spawning inside of your creation, it shouldn't do that, it spawns you at the center of your plot, at the highest point that's 100% unoccupied
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 03:53:20 If you're spawning in the wrong seat, the main pilot seat is your spawn point when you enter flight mode
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:40:39 What about reflectivity? I know some of my crafts could use some polish
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:44:56 Let a friend copy or something? To be honest that's pretty awesome either way
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:45:23 -Cue the flood of art projects on Plane Crazy-
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:46:06 Bit under the weather, but I'm willing to try
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:46:26 Basically I'm a bit sick
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 19:47:46 I'm gonna invite a friend, is that fine?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:53:11 Ah, so you made 2, linked their controls together?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:54:16 Cool
creations-chat 2019-05-04 19:54:37 I tried a similar idea, except with actual people in different planes, this is the best result
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 20:15:03 A friend with a sub-par computer came on and tested little to no lag within the server, material parts are fine but could use a bit more of a transparency spike, as some materials obscure this very well, however, there is a weird wheel wobble going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 20:30:31 To be honest I don't care that Inferno's hacking, 
1: He's not hacking maliciously
2: He's one of us, sooo

plane-crazy 2019-05-04 22:18:15 Good, I'll bug you if your temper goes a bit out of control
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:23:20 .... <@!334819623021314061>
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:23:35 <@!202959294705041408> , Shut up
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:24:23 You weren't involved in this, so it's not you that's being "racisted"
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:26:36 RIGHT, DAILY REMINDER TO ALL YOU ASSHOLES THINKING ABOUT POSTING MORE SHIT IN HERE, THIS PLACE STILL FOLLOWS THE RULES, READ THE DISCLAIMER AT THE TOP YA FUCKWITS, if that seems harsh, that's because we've had 2 people that broke rules in here
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:26:56 Imperial, look in the action logs, it IS actually racist ...
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:27:19 Colonel, how about you be quiet?
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:27:53 And Rytim, quite frankly, if you can't follow the rules, get out of the server, it pretty much boils down to "be a decent human being"
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:28:47 ........
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:29:54 Colonel, don't spam that, I'm not saying you spammed it, I'm telling you that before you start spamming it
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:30:26 .... <@251113404645900289> , you will stay here and deal with the shitstorm you kicked up
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:30:37 Because __***YOU***__ were the one to cause problems ...
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:30:40 Imperial that might be a bit harsh
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:14 I'm just in a bad mood because people can't be bothered reading
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:33 Yes Imperial, people tend to take a hint when you slap them with a giant stop sign
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:31:48 I refuse to go anywhere with you ...
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:32:09 Or settle it my way, https://i.imgur.com/EaZiQTG.gif?noredirect
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:33:38 Okay but seriously, just cut the crap, it's not a directed message, and you should only get offended by it if you actually fit the criteria within it, in which case it's your own fault for acting that way
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:34:06 Probably because WFYB has people trolling these builds, and stricter limitations
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:34:41 I happened to be trying to type that out after the microgun gif
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 03:35:05 Block choice, it needs to float, and money limitation
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:35:35 ... <@!481807144963014657> , Are you, ACTUALLY trying to cause ear damage?
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:36:20 My volume was at 2 for the love of fuck and I could hear it through my headphones when I wasn't wearing them
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:37:12 Trust me, they aren't loud
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:38:10 .... That doesn't make sense Empire, let me run through what I meant a bit more thoroughly
I had my headphones plugged in, and when I took them off after hearing that, I could still hear it quite audibly, even with the volume at 2 as well
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:38:39 Yes Colonel, it was so loud that I could hear them outside of my headphones, and don't even get me started on what it was like WITH them on
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:39:26 These ones are freaking quiet if you aren't wearing them
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:40:17 To give an idea of what these are like, a video sounds like a 2, when I have them at 100%, and aren't wearing them
the-dump 2019-05-05 03:40:51 If you have proof of past roles, you can show them to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:07:41 Katze, Sam, cut it out, especially you Sam
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:08:10 She never said you were immature, period
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 04:14:47 1: Shut it, I wasn't the one that unmuted him
2: There was a valid reason to mute him, it's just that he keeps on BEGGING whenever he does something wrong, or pretending to back down
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:11 THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:20 Right, catch me up now ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:25 Sam, Colonel, shut up FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:16:45 I'll turn the music on once someone catches me up on what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:06 ......................
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:20 Do not tarnish my name with anything, got it? I'm really tired now
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:17:56 Right, music back on, enjoy yourselves, and DON'T try to have any crazy antics in here, otherwise I'm going to come swinging with a ban hammer to someone's unfortunate face
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 05:18:28 Ace pilot's been removed from acquisition, it's only circulating around because people have gotten it before
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:30:38 Whaaaaat?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:30:44 Hold on, can you not ping her Imperial?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:31:14 COLONEL LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE FOR THE LOVE OF DAMNNATION, seriously, why do you think I remain silent in this server?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:31:40 Every single TIME I COME ON, it's irritating and creepy at this point
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:01 Hi battleship, tired and a bit freaked out to heck
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:28 Riiiip, welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:32:47 Okay okay okay no more pings before this goes out of control
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:33:04 Colonel, HE can say hi because he doesn't breathe down my neck at the first moment to say hi to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:33:49 Madness
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:34:24 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:35:47 I mean, to be honest, why do people panic when they ping me, you need to have 3 criteria line up at the same time to piss me off with a ping, and that's
1: I'm pissed off during the day
2: You have to have pissed me off recently, and I mean REALLY have done so
3: It's spammed repeatedly or with insults directed at me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:36:40 He seems to get up late at night, at least as far as I can tell
creations-chat 2019-05-05 15:37:06 Done
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:37:42 Saved his ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:09 Er, sorry Katze, when I ban people I always grab their ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:17 The OTHERS however don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:38:31 At least most of the time that I've seen
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:39:43 Don't look at us, we can't adjust ranks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:41:18 <@!249373398612967441> , Try using a ton of mini-ropes combined together into one big rope
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:42:11 Wait, seriously? Including the block connections?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:42:24 I have no idea then
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 15:45:00 <@!249373398612967441> , You got it
creations-chat 2019-05-05 17:34:50 Done
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:54:26 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:54:52 The plane I built was just a scrap one for testing purposes, I didn't really put any real effort into it
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 17:55:20 I mean, it's literally about 7-8 blocks with a cross of control surfaces at the front and back, and a super rocket in the back
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 18:33:16 The thing is, for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, use front wheel drive to counteract that
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:13:36 I already mentioned Rick, it's fine, I can rebuild them in seconds anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:14:10 Literally the largest build I have in there's about 59 parts, and that was the wall with wheels
general 2019-05-05 19:15:32 This is why Roblox military groups are, in my opinion, nothing but bad
general 2019-05-05 19:16:45 In the 2 I've been in, they ask for unhealthy amounts of dedication, and only pertain to paying people as "high ranks", or those that dedicate an excessive amount of time, basically a crap mobile pay to win phone game, except played out with "human" interactions and relationships instead
general 2019-05-05 19:18:37 To be honest, I haven't seen any that have broken the mold
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:20:03 Distinct features in certain races? Like, I know some bugs have massively different males and females
general 2019-05-05 19:20:33 Sounds like every single military group
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:20:48 Okay okay okay cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:02 Nooot true Hidear, care to be a test subject?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:27 Er HOLD ON HOLD ON
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:22:31 Jesus effing christ
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:01 WAAAIIIIIIT!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:09 God, freaking, effing, save the roles first
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:22 Hidear, you wanted to test if someone you blocked could ban you
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:31 Lego volunteered for it and I'm recording his ranks down
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:32 Wait no
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:36 That's a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:38 Bans wipe the chat
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:23:53 Wait they don't? Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:15 
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:26 
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:24:32 Right, both of you are logged down, are you STILL volunteering?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:25:23 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:04 I gave him  an invite code, if this doesn't work, friend request me and DM me Lego
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:13 It's a one-use code
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:17 WAIT!
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:21 Wait for him to say he's ready
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:47 God fucking, wrong person! hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:26:52 God I'm beyond tired here
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:27:15 Er, unblock me temporarily? I need to send the link
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:28:07 Yeah it does wipe the chat Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:28:12 And Colonel, it'll show up with the note
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:29:06 I think they'll still be there
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:30:24 <@!421848903361757184> , I gave you everything back, also not a problem
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:34:10 I wonder if someone could make one of those weird perspective art things, where if you look at it one way, it shows one picture, but if you look at it another way, it shows another picture
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 19:34:54 Yeup
general 2019-05-05 21:04:26 Question, how complicated is MachineCraft?
general 2019-05-05 21:17:26 Wait, so basically can all the motors move freely? Or are they preset?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:16:31 Tiny flag on the center mast?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:57:05 We have Google you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:58:13 Jacob, if friction wasn't a thing, you wouldn't be able to go anywhere, literally
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:58:56 Apparently you're "lazy" enough to want a block, which you don't HAVE to use, be removed
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 23:59:40 He's on my blocked list, but that was before I took notes, so I'm 99.9% sure he was banned for something, and I was the one that did it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:00:01 .... Jacob, let me ask you honestly, what sort of psychedelics are you on?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:02 ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:21 I only unblocked him so I could get an easier time taking that screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:01:37 Jacob, answer, now, how damn old are you?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:15 ... You're on psychadelics
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:25 Not sure Brick, ask someone to build a platform for you
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:35 But Jacob, we already said what it does ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:02:59 RIP Brick
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:03:34 Then act like you're okay, one of my nephews, who's fucking 4, can spell better than you can
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:04:06 What do you even have to counterclaim about?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:04:24 If this is a joke, it's an awful one that's making everyone frustrated
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:05:59 Probably VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:08:38 ............. Just, what context does that have exactly <@!384516066665299968> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:09:15 Why, did you post it here, when it was out of context?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:09:31 Of course it works ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:06 Maybe you aren't using it in the correct way, the friction block is supposed to provide extra friction compared to other blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:23 When WELDED onto another block, it does nothing, but when it touches the ground, it's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:10:30 Compare friction blocks to ice blocks then
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:11:11 Jacob, I doubt that you got the WPM scores you did in <#495286269459300364> , because you can't prove it now
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:21 ....... Just the fuck are you talking about jacob? There's literally 0 context ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:37 What level lego?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:12:54 Ah, ouch, can't
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:14:11 Alright then <@!384516066665299968> , you wanna prove you got that WPM? Recite the first 5 rules in <#533294912586645521> , except do so with capslock on
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:14:40 Words Per Minute
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:15:40 <@!384516066665299968> ...... Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:16:19 Wroooong, I said capslock on, meaning you repeat the message, except inverse everything
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:16:34 So "Peter Piper" would be "pETER pIPER"
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:17:33 Yeah those WPM scores aren't yours jacob, you've shown no evidence that you can even have enough mental activity in order to reach double digit WPMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:18:23 Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo buffalo buffalo
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:19:03 ... Okay thanks for proving that test doesn't work Lego (No seriously thanks), right, now then
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:26:13 Like 99% of us know
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:25 RIP, at least Turismo will respawn once you walk away
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:38 Curly, scifi battleship focused on a hidden spinal gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:27:58 Basically it opens up to reveal a MASSIVE gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:28:38 The fuck is nitro typing?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:33:40 No thanks, burned out to hell with DQ here
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:33:52 I guess I played TOO much tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:35:32 Take a guess what you think it does, a wild one if you need to
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:36:46 I'm guessing it has more grip? Try sliding it and seeing what happens compared to another block
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:04 .... Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:14 Uhhhhh, you're sure of this, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 00:56:29 We have people leaking all the time, could be coincidence

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 01:08:49 No, but whyyyy did you post it here?

creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:05:25 ... Excuse me while I throw up at that "boat" that funny has
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:05:50 It's a mobile gun platform, not a fucking boat by any definition
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:07 And even if it's original, it's going to burn into people's minds yes, by how awful and low effort it is
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:17 BOTH OF YOU CUT IT OUT
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:06:49 Funny, it's low effort, and unoriginal, you literally just took the gun turret idea and attached it to a "boat", which is nothing more than a bunch of wedges mashed together, end of fucking story
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:07:34 I do not give a damn what you think, I've seen almost every single build in this game and I can say with certainty that quite literally someone built a floating gun platform before
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:07:41 End, of, story
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:08:29 I will grab a dictionary and bash your fucking dumbass face in, specifically with the page citing what original is, because I literally mentioned that someone built a gun platform before on the water in a very similar fashion as to what you have done
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:08:48 And TL;DR, nobody's going to care about what you say at this rate
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:09:24 Alright, you want me to fucking look up the definition of original? I'll fucking hang you with those words

creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:10:29 
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:14 Your fucking floating turret isn't original, people have made it before in multiple iterations, maybe you're original in the worst of ways
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:40 TL;DR, you don't care because you want to lock yourself in a narcissistic bubble and believe that you're right
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:11:57 And I'm saying it isn't, to the point where I
creations-chat 2019-05-06 18:12:14 Infact, I'm LITERALLY going to take it down unless you shut up and quit trying to push for modeler

plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:23:03 It's 9999 days
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:23:20 That's 27 years
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:23:33 As close to a perma as you're getting
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:23:40 Hell, Roblox is probably gonna die WELL before then
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:23:56 I could've just stopped at like 3-4 years, but I decided to show juuuuust how much I hated that asshole
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:24:18 If he comes on with an alt I'm going to personally use my hotline to have that guy hit (In an internet sense)
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:25:10 They do, it's just that they wield the power to do so, and more
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:29:05 Apparently today
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:29:12 2 hours ago infact
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:32:21 Could I get a volunteer to monitor <#504436696021204992> for me? See if they're able to see it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:32:49 Ping me if they're unable to do so, I'm messing with the settings a bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:33:30 Yeah, that's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:34:21 Okay, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:34:32 I'm just messing with it so we don't get a repeat of someone bypassing
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:34:49 Er, could someone else volunteer to be given the mute role temporarily and tell me if they're able to see it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:35:15 Now guys?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:35:49 Alright, mega, mind if I temporarily give you the mute role to see if you can see it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:36:00 Got it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:36:59 Hi, we're bugfixing stuff here, don't worry if the channels start acting weird
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:37:04 They must apply to the rules ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:37:29 .............
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:37:43 Voice modulator?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:37:53 Cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:38:08 I mean, it's known pretty well, still decent though
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 18:39:08 <@!308156968550268928> Thaaaaank ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:21:06 Well holy freaking hell
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:21:15 Wait isn't that the game guy that made the temper tantrum reddit post?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:21:47 I swear it was jetbuilder that raged needlessly
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:22:51 They do realize that there's a version of Plane Crazy that's set to the older days, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:06 A tip jar, that's literally it
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:16 It serves no purpose other than being a tiny tip jar
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:23:31 It even occupies the space it's in, it's just a thing to weld to your craft
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:24:01 And his groups as well FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:24:58 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:29 Nah, a cardboard box
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:38 You know, maybe we need a PR guy to fix this
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:25:54 Because clearly these idiots are just gonna keep on mucking up stuff for everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:28:27 A logic gate requires sensors to work, they're if, and, or, xor, etc gates, that trigger when one or more, or none parameters are active
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:29:49 Example (There's 3 parameters in this):
And: T/T/F = F, F/F/F = F, T/T/T = T
Or: T/F/F = T, T/F/T = T, F/F/F = F
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:33:58 It's this, but completely uncultured and full of kids that don't grasp how to leftclick (Literally at one point), what did you expect?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:38:33 Wasn't me I'll tell you that much
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:38:58 __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:39:06 "It wasn't me"
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:39:39 https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/1/17/CoinMK8.png/1200px-CoinMK8.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 19:40:00 I wonder what those things are made of though
creations-chat 2019-05-06 19:59:08 <@178298325806743552> , after a bit of debate, we decided to give you modeler
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:46:17 ?
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:47:02 Done
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:47:16 Runway's sufficient, just from eyeballing it briefly
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:47:44 After doing stuff like this, I'm pretty good at judging runway size requirements
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:49:03 Done
creations-chat 2019-05-06 20:49:16 The actual runway it's self is a bit narrow, but it's flat enough that you can make do
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 23:39:45 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 23:39:53 Alriiiight then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-06 23:39:54 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 01:23:19 Do "&suggest (Suggestion)" in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 01:23:34 Make sure to check <#507673335816126509> , the pins specifically
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:23:30 Mega, use RCS, balance out the weight using heavier materials, and actually finish the design, many designs are actually far more balanced if tested fully
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:23:52 That's why I always finish the primary shape of the craft, or at least equalize it, before testing flight capabilities, then I give an estimate on what I need to do to improve it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:24:55 Including the rear section?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:27:29 I'd imagine that it lowers the center of lift so it has more of an effect on the pitch, and causes a downwards pitch, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:34:50 It's not the worst, but it's not the best either
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:35:55 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:36:04 Inventor thing? We're debating it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:36:18 Just note that if you get inventor, we have every right to take it away should we find contradictory information
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:48:39 Yeeeeup
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:50:40 It's mostly unsuccessful, but I have
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:50:58 It stops some of the most SEVERE ones, but it doesn't stop minor or hidden ones
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:51:12 Black, wait for it, it's gonna take a while
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:55:16 Blackbird, your mechanism's close, but you need to do more with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 18:56:46 Like, do stuff with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 20:51:49 Or be able to point out WHY it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:21:04 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:21:23 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:22:36 "Bruh", nothing, even if it's a joke, it's still racist, namely the "school shooting" thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:22:50 ............
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:14 Can't I have a fucking nice day for once in my life?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:30 SHUT IT, that's as close to what it actually is as I'm getting to
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:37 .............
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:23:56 Guys, cut it out, talk about something freaking else
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:24:02 Oh, sorry Grab!
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:24:21 Done <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:25:02 ... How about you quit being rude and obnoxious before I use the full fucking arsenal of democracy on your god damn ass <@!260544767446745088>
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:00 If he DMs any of you anything rude, I'm going to unmute and warn him
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:25 Katze, it depends
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:37 .............
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:41 ALL OF YOU CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:26:59 God, can we talk about something else? I'm freaking going to loose it at this rate
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:27:07 <@!249373398612967441> , let people like what they fucking like
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:27:16 As long as it doesn't affect you, who cares?
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:28:38 Empire ... Fucking hell
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:33:35 ......................
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:33:43 Not now guys, I'm not having a good day
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:43:56 Fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:44:01 Ing
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:44:10 HELL
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:44:22 You know what fuck this, taking executive action
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:45:33 I portrayed the statement he posted in my screenshots by the way, along with more context ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:07 TL;DR on what he sent, I disagreed with him saying that communism and naziism was bad, simply because you were associated with them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:16 It's not the ideology that makes you bad, it's what you do with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:46:36 Get that through your heads people (This is to anyone who hasn't done so already), it doesn't matter what tools you have, but how you use them
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:04 ... <@!518187868347170818> ***Yeeeees?***
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:18 I'm just, really on edge here, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 22:47:43 Can we just drop this? I'm not in the mood to cut down someone else if they spark an argument
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 23:16:52 ?unban 260544767446745088 Petittioned by a friend, seems to have calmed down, or so their friend says
plane-crazy 2019-05-07 23:16:55 ....
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 02:51:45 What, are you even saying?
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 02:53:22 Surprisingly enough, not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 05:56:24 Wait, is that you modeling it shin?
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 22:23:56 <@237359768405147649> , Those are speed wobbles, you can only counteract them by reducing lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:31:48 "SHIIIIIT, FULL REVERSE!!"
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:35:54 To be honest that's actually a pretty good sign of the engine power
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:22 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:36:52 I would've added another 9 to it, but I don't think Dyno would've liked that
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:47:28 ... The fuck are you trying to do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:47:54 You know you can just sit in the server as a person, even if you quit the game, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:48:09 We don't care, you're allowed in as long as you follow the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:48:14 ..... Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:17 Someone was booted before, turned out they were hacked at the time, so they used the landline I left, and they rejoined the server once they fought off the guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:39 Hence why if someone starts acting very abnormally, I'll leave a message to them via DMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 01:50:47 Er, moreso hotline? I don't know, a connection to them
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 04:14:07 (The, heck are you playing?)
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:39:58 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:40:41 Done
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:41:11 I already did it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:42:47 Modeler's obvious
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:43:07 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:43:11 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:43:17 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:12 Meh, I've gotta agree with them
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:33 It sorta blends in with the other airships in my memory, if you want modeler, you need to make it UNIQUE
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:44:39 Like, we will not see another one like it, PERIOD
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:45:48 Ehhhhh, yeah no it just blends way too well together
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:46:11 I mean, with mine, you see that silhouette in the sky and you either tremble in fear or cheer in glory
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:47:03 With that, it blends with alot of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:10:16 Excuse me for a moment while I just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:15:59 .... <@!320245850892795904>
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:16:06 Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:16:13 EXCUSE ME!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:16:24 Dm me what the fuck they said
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:16:48 ...............
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:01 That should be common sense <@!320245850892795904> , if you don't know them, you shouldn't be able to mention them
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:09 Yet you pretty much nailed one right on the damn head ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:44 And I have a friend in Southeast Asia who's brilliant at talking Flauwe
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:18:53 NSFW, to boil it down, means inappropriate for children
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:01 Not Safe For Work to be exact
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:15 If you can't do it or say that infront of your boss, teacher or parents, don't say it in the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:19 Sorry Black, just dealing with this
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:45 Sorry, your volume's low, say that again Flauwe?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:19:50 Also, Blackbird, wait a freaking moment!
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:20:10 Yes, you can't say that here
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:20:48 First of all, my old roommate was Chinese, and he was ALOT smarter than you <@!320245850892795904>
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:21:05 Second, that doesn't make you immune to punishments
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:21:38 Alright then, if you're so smart, what's the sine of 1?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:05 Ahah, you're not the smartest Chinese person then, because my friend knew that
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:23 Swears (Fuck, Shit, Damn, Crap), are allowed in limited quantities, and not in a hostile manner
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:22:55 Except that's a JOKE
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:23:04 <@!320245850892795904> , That's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:23:38 You do realize that 99.9% of Family Guy things are ABSOLUTELY overly exaggerated, if not completely falsified for a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:24:07 That's the running joke with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:25:02 ... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:25:42 I mean, your life goals are up to you
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:23 But let me clarify one thing, Family Guy is not racist because it's literally a show about bad jokes played out, you're not SUPPOSED to see it as realistic
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:39 Anyways, just, think before you say it, if you're not sure, ask a mod or one of the trusted people
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:26:53 FFS, let me explain it, things are exaggerated
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:19 Not exactly true
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:44 There IS no off-topic Blackbird, general is now just whatever the current topic is
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:27:59 .... Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:01 Do not
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:02 Say
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:04 You are smarter than us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:28:26 ........... If that's a joke it's getting annoying, so shut it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:29:29 Except in the real world they aren't a real thing, also, pesos aren't Chinese
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:23 Beat you to the punch
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:31 Ahah, you're mixing up your story
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:30:40 <@!320245850892795904> , Cut the lying
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:31:44 So you got the Peso part correct, but which peso? There's multiple types
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:31:48 ?warn
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:32:09 Let me boil it down to you, so shut up for a moment and let me list it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:04 1: You're trying to raise yourself above everyone else, to the point of getting special points, even if proven wrong
2: You're trying to harass everyone by trying to shut them up
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:30 Capital of Texas, answer in 10 seconds or else you're googling it, go
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:44 Time's up, Austin
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:33:47 Austin Texas
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:34:08 If you're smart, then what's the sine and cosine of 1?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:34:45 Except that's not just the "english mathematicas", that's the WORLD mathematics
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:08 Wroooong
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:17 Wrong X2
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:29 10 seconds have passed
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:41 20 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:35:43 You googled it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:37:27 Except 1: We can convert to the metric system
2: Many of us DO infact use the metric system, because __***BIG SPOILER!!!***__, alot of us aren't American!
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:17 Now here's a question that everyone who's taken basic science courses (A prerequisite for practicing medicine) knows, how long does it take light to reach Earth?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:36 Okay now you're definitely just trolling us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:46 I was trying to get them to answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:38:52 ...... Actually,
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:39:37 <@!320245850892795904> , Show proof that you're over 13 years of age, in-game
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:39:54 Now there's something you're ENTIRELY fucking wrong on
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:06 Smart people aren't smart because they're naturally smart
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:21 Smart people build off of other people's developments
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:28 That's why they're smart
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:40:59 ............... <@!320245850892795904> , Right, cut out the joke, now, and quit lying to us
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:42:33 <@!320245850892795904> , Quit lying, quit harassing others, quit EVERYTHING, while it was a good laugh at first, it was irritating, especially since you were taking it way too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:42:50 And if you want a rank, ping me for the rank, I'm pretty much 100% fine with pings as long as it's not harassing me
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:08 "@ (Username here)"
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:14 ....
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:43:22 You shouldn't have gotten attention in that way you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:44:08 Okay to be 100% honest I'm tempted to not give this guy the rank because of the act he pulled off, but at the same time the sub's not half bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:44:44 Sadly no
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:45:25 Right right right, one last question
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:45:32 Sorry Kayn, it's just, it's taken a bit too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:45:38 Actually, more like a statement rather than a question
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:47:28 <@!320245850892795904> , Show __***THIS***__ screen (I've redacted some of the parts for privacy of friends and myself)
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:47:42 Okaayyyyy, enough Black, it's a bit much now if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:48:29 Meh, I just decided to
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:48:51 <@!320245850892795904>

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:24 Uhhhh, might've been a bad set of suggestions in the past Neutronium
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:34 Let me just fix that, you know the drill for suggestions, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:49:54 Yeah, someone likely put that on after a string of poor or sub-par suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:28 ........ No, I only go incognito mode because I feel comfortable using it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:38 It's gone now Neutronium, don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:50:54 Now then Flauwe, don't beat around the bush, show us that page
creations-chat 2019-05-10 18:54:13 Show the part count?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:54:43 You're clear, I just needed to check
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:55:06 That's the primary way we catch people under 13 years of age, which, after a Discord Terms of Service update, is LITERALLY ILLEGAL
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:55:18 Basically if you're under 13 years old, and you're using Discord, parental permission or not, you're breaking the law
creations-chat 2019-05-10 18:55:42 Rooster, don't worry, I can clean up any mistakes you make
creations-chat 2019-05-10 18:56:01 Also, <@!421687658809524224> , how many parts is it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:56:23 There's 2 dead giveaways
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:56:39 1: The username part in the upper right
2: URL
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:57:37 If it does that then you're under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:57:55 web.roblox is if you're under 13 years old, www.roblox is if you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:58:06 Yeup, it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 18:58:15 We had multiple confirmed cases
creations-chat 2019-05-10 18:58:30 Matas, how many parts is it? I can give you a ship rank based off of that
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:00:10 What'd be cool is a proper lock, something like this http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/lock-picking-cylinder.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:00:48 While something like that wouldn't give you inventor, it'd probably give modeler, because let's face it, it's gonna be a PAIN to do so
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:05:37 <@!260797229068058634> !
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:05:46 Can you please ease up on the soundboard
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:18 No, it's moreso I did so
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:27 Okay okay okay fine at least note it down that you're doing something
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:06:53 FFS, just, I don't even know
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:07:10 That is actually pretty loud <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:07:46 Oh, look at the date it was posted on
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 19:28:01 I wonder which mod's the most liked
bot-central 2019-05-10 19:48:49 You do realize that we have the paint tool, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:11 I think it's insectophobia
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:22 FML <@!417295378401198080> ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:22:48 "Fuck My Life", I saw that Gerardo ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:03 It wasn't specifically NSFW
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:08 I'm going to pretend I didn't see that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:20 But if that pops up again Gerardo I'm gonna lynch you, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:38 It's not strictly NSFW Danny, but it's suggestive as fuck if anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:23:50 Agoraphobia is the fear of large spaces I think
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:02 <@438884464060399630> , If we could think up of an original build, well it's not really original now is it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:17 Don't worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:25:18 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:26:15 I'm not entirely sure Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:27:35 Er, "batter" gun, you mean "Battleship" gun?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:28:42 You mean the primary gun on a battleship?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 02:29:05 That might work, I'm gonna check a video to see what it's like, and how accurately you nail it
creations-chat 2019-05-11 17:57:11 <@!421687658809524224> , You're ranked with Sea Marshal, nice job!
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:33:50 <@!519250434976776241> , Gifs in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:34:48 <@!260544767446745088> ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:12 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:17 I have a damn note on you <@!260544767446745088>
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:35:33 <@!519250434976776241> , <#495286269459300364> , __***NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:20 Cake, the fuck you call this then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:38 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:36:46 Right, the problem is they're entirely out of context
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:37:22 There's plenty of times where there's context, infact there are a couple of times where that would've been a proper context
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:37:58 <@!260544767446745088> , Shut it, I'm surprised you got unbanned, I DON'T make notes on people unless I ban them, and when I ban them, I ban them for a very valid reason
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:08 .... Oh wait nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:14 FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:35 I just realized I never changed the note on him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:38:47 Some guy appealed him, so I decided to unban him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:18 Just, tone it back Kompaktt, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:46 ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:39:49 Kompaktt
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:10 I know it's all freaking over the place, I'm TRYING to fix that
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:38 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:40:55 Can you two quit butting heads before I smash them together into a bloody mess? (All metaphorically of course)
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:41:22 I don't care who started it, just both of you end it please, it's 3:41 AM over here
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:41:40 Cake, it's called timezones
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:15 Right, talk about timezones or new parts or something, now goodnight, I'm tired as crap, <@!468207489524039680> , take over and make sure there's no arguments, AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:31 <@!519250434976776241> , I SAID CAN YOU CUT IT OUT, I DON'T CARE WHO STARTED IT I WANT YOU BOTH TO END IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:42:46 <@!260544767446745088> , YOU TO
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:12 Just don't coax the other person on, and if one of you coax the other on I swear
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:18 Now good freaking night
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:43:35 <@!519250434976776241> , just be nice and pretend no arguments happened, that's all
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:47:20 __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 07:47:31 Jail, can you PLEASE take over for me
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:42:11 <@456226577798135808> CUT IT OUT
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:42:23 ....
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:43:04 ?warn <@456226577798135808> , continually spamming the same "song" repeatedly, in an absurdly excessive manner, one potentially NSFW
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:43:18 ..... Freaking,
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:43:28 Screw you as well Mee6
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:43:42 =loop
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:43:44 =skip
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:44:14 THERE we go
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:44:46 I literally have over 100 messages of that song being BARFED onto <#384027830192832513>
bot-central 2019-05-12 17:44:54 So next time don't loop something as stupid as that
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:17:57 ....
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:18:29 <@456226577798135808> CUT IT OUT
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:18:58 ......... "Sorry" doesn't fucking cut it
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:10 Yes, it is infact highly bannable, to the point where I'm going to warn you again for SPAMMING IT DUMBASS
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:20 ....
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:22 Okay fuck you
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:35 !ban <@456226577798135808> Not reading the rules and spamming inappropriate creations constantly
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:38 ....
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:19:39 <@!339519624968404993>
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:20:34 He's muted
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:20:39 I quarantined the fucker
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:22:07 I made a note on him
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:22:59 Sadly with the way Discord moderation works, we needed to have not deleted his thing in order for them to actually take action against him
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:15 And they do infact need evidence of such a thing happening
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:32 Perfect
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:35 DO NOT DELETE IT
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:23:54 It's still there
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:26:21 Just don't scroll up guys
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:26:27 <#384025409945337856> is clean, just don't scroll up
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:26:40 I need to preserve it so Discord staff can moderate it
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:26:47 Last few times I wasn't able to because the messages were deleted
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:27:31 Right, it's sent
creations-chat 2019-05-12 20:27:51 Once I get the confirmation E-mail that they've taken action, I'll take it down
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:28:49 <@456226577798135808> , IGNORE IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:29:10 TL;DR: Discord staff won't take action unless we actually have a screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:29:30 Er, not a screenshot, unless we don't delete the message
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:30:04 Depends, it ranges from an IP ban with VPN prevention, to a potential cease and desist, maybe even being fined and jailed for spreading NSFW stuff to people underage
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:31:09 Let me put it this way, and let me be blunt, if someone posted a picture of a nude guy in a school, what do you think would happen to the person that posted it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:31:54 Just, point is they're gonna take action against him
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:32:25 Right can we move on from this?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:33:04 <@!267010494030807042> , Freaking rule 2's a thing, we need to enforce that, otherwise we'll get shot down by Roblox
creations-chat 2019-05-12 22:14:51 God fucking, guys, next time quarantine off the area and save the image, then report the guy and his creation or "creation", just Google "Discord Report"
creations-chat 2019-05-12 22:16:21 After you get the confirmation E-mail, delete the message and re-open the channel
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:20:59 ... Seriously Malicious?
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:21:31 Just feel glad that I'm the most open for feedback, mostly so I can improve myself, now cite specifically what the problem is
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:24:09 I mean, it's human nature to remember the most negative parts
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:24:26 Although at the same time, Danny does have a point, and the reason why is because, it's either common courtesy or common sense
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:25:21 I mean, to be honest, as far as I've seen so far, it's gotten the reaction I needed, which is to shock and halt people from doing what they're doing
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:34:01 Hey, he needs a break sometimes, he's not a machine
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 00:34:21 It'd be nice if he could work on updates constantly, but that's completely inhumane
bug-reports 2019-05-13 00:38:49 Must be the engine not working anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:30 It's just a ton of memes, although, <@!551557693354147850> , mind if I erase that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:40 .... Uhhh, yeah no I'm wiping that temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:39:58 Don't worry about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:40:17 Problem is people get VERY pissy over the slightest of spoilers, sooo, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 23:40:28 It wasn't the worst, but just so nobody gets pissed off I'll just wipe it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:59:28 Custom roles ain't allowed, even as jokes, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:02:11 That was before Voxel started cracking down on them, I'm not sure if he's gonna fix that or not, but for now just know that it's not gonna be a thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:23:21 It's pretty broken, you're most of the way through though
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:24:12 I'd say just skip through, the landing gear's mostly aesthetic, and you just need the purple screwdriver to set up controls, also a main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:24:19 Everything else, tinker with and see what it does
creations-chat 2019-05-14 01:27:52 You are 3 blocks above micro engineer
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:29:35 Check the controls, see if they're inverted, and if they're auto-controls, use the mouse
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:30:18 Wings, there's a control surface
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 01:30:47 Did you click the green plane icon to fly?
help 2019-05-14 02:00:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:29:13 Speaking of Future is Bright, I've been seeing it on alot more places recently, looks fantastic if done right
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:29:46 Although I haven't seen a Roblox-wide conversion yet, probably because it's presumably VERY LAGGY
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:30:19 Er, how though? Like, did someone throw you to that door?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:30:26 It is
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:01 I mean, old styles were sorta it's theme, and who's to say old games are bad games?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:24 Anyone remember Plane Wars?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:57 Used to love the crap outa that game, even though at the time, I wasn't exactly the best pilot
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:45:45 <@!308156968550268928> , While I would like to think we could do all these awareness campaigns, sadly it'd be hard to represent some of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:46:25 I'll leave it up there though, see if people want to put the effort in
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:37:03 Space engineers, you built a Yamato from Starcraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 00:43:26 Blame Roblox, not us, also I'd suggest shifting around your stuff, like everything
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:05:21 <@!401515741905420289> , can you NOT upvote yourself? We do check for self-upvotes, and they generally don't pass off as looking like a good guy (No seriously, they really don't)
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:08:08 It's highly frowned upon by, basically everyone, but it's not specifically against the rules
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:09:29 Forget it, hold on
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:09:57 Also, editing? Seriously?
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:10:25 Alright, fine
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:10:54 By the way, just to double check, you are over 13 years old, right? We're not just asking because of ourselves, we're asking because YOU could get into trouble with the law if you're under 13 years old
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:12:53 No they have done stuff to people, I can confirm they slapped a fine on one of my dumb relatives' parents, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:13:38 Dunno, care to test it out for us? The seats should be equal weight, so just adjust ballast on both ends until they float equally
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:13:51 For being underage on Discord against parental permission
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:15:41 Er, for their child being underage on Discord
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:17:18 Don't forget, it occupies 2 blocks worth of space
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:18:19 <#519624169730605086> , but you likely need a rank from <#544022464133595166> first to prove that you actually invest time in-game
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:18:42 It's not the worst I've seen, and to be honest it's far above the average Robloxian at this point
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:19:00 Hi Battleship
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:19:14 ~~Absolutely fuck no~~ ehhhh?
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:19:39 Hey, I cross stuff out when it's a joke
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:20:06 I don't ACTUALLY think it's bad to be honest
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:20:34 Bit unprofessional sure, but still
creations-chat 2019-05-15 03:21:01 No, and you will never find out my real name
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:47 Wait seriously? And you tested this with a sea-saw?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:52 Or, whatever it's called?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:21:56 HUH
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:13 Test everything vs everything, now I'm genuinely curious what's heavier than what in terms of relativity
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:38 Basically Spy
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:22:57 Also why does that wing design make me think of a butterfly's wings <@206891768233328640> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:23:06 Grav, test a rocket engine vs super rocket
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:21 Depends, 99% of the time, yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:32 Well, more like 70% of the time, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:47 I mean, I guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 03:46:54 ALSO HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT HAVE A HIGHER RATING THAN PLANE CRAZY!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:13 Yes <@!202959294705041408> , that is true, but I expect literally every single movement
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:28 And I will double and triple check it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:38 Which one?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:06:56 <@!364352162563883008>
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:07:08 ... Show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:07:40 SHOW, US
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:08:34 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:08:41 I mean you Colonel, who the hell else would I mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:10:45 Not half bad Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:12:38 Won't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:12:59 It won't, that's not how the explosions work, I've tried it on my Wyvern and it's not how it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:13:18 Not to mention you don't have the casing, nor do you have a proper separation of the bullet head
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:13:45 .... Seriously Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:14:27 I expect SOMETHING LIKE THIS http://www.thefirearms.guide/wp-content/uploads/diag_bullet-cutout.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:15:00 The actual bullet inside of the casing, with a "primer" in the back (That can be the magnet) with some powder inside
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:15:22 He's trying for inventor Empire ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:16:25 Except I've already seen that happen
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:16:58 The inventor task I've assigned him is to make a rifle, that fires a bullet, ejects the casing, and can load another round, whether by mag or by "hand"
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:17:36 "WHETHER __***BY MAG***__ OR __***BY HAND***__"
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:18:48 There's very few guns that eject without opening the slide, and those are moreso muskets than guns
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:19:27 I mean, true Turismo, although I'm pretty sure they still open up to let something out
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:20:26 Huh, never knew that Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:24:58 Not .wmvs, use a converter or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:05 .wmv files can harbor viruses, I had to deal with a couple
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:26 Just to anything that'll run naturally
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:25:56 Ever heard of using Google and just googling your problem?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:26:01 Er, pfff, up to you Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:42 THE F-
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:44 Well
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:27:45 Then
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:28:46 I've put it up to the board, well then
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 04:29:34 It's fine, I put it up to the board because I need to go for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:22:44 <@!233845993907552256> , Yes, a billion people have reported the tutorial's broken, the problem is that without the tutorial, people would have no idea what to do, so it's better than nothing at the very least
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:26:03 Are you in a PVP server? If not, what are you using?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:27:36 There's PVP servers where stuff can explode you (Explosive blocks, missiles, etc), and non-PVP servers, by "explode", do you mean actually explode, or just parts flew everywhere randomly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:29:09 You must've been hit by a missile, explosive block, detonated an explosive block, or there's a hacker on your server, if it's not a PVP server, it's the last part
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:30:06 Really hard to do so and not really needed up until this point, you SURE it exploded in a non-PVP server? Check if guns can fire if you're still in it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:30:27 If you see a little yellow, then red trail, that's the guns firing, which means you're in a PVP server, which means someone likely sniped you with a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 07:31:25 Huh, well then, consolidate a message about the explosion in the non-PVP server in <#478584971670454284> , and be sure to note that it wasn't a PVP server
help 2019-05-15 07:33:09 ^ He's talking about with the standard Roblox explosion effect, not just a glitch like a ropestorm or a motor breaking and flinging
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:40:18 <@!202959294705041408> , can you quit DMing me? It was voted no by like the whole group, it's nice yes, but apparently it was done before
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:42:46 The bloody hell? The front page is drunk! GIVE IT MORE ALCOHOL!
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:42:58 Let's boot the popular "games" off the front page

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:47:26 I didn't scroll up just to upvote i- wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:48:03 Yeah he didn't self-upvote

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:20:50 It's called bot attacks Rick, people do bot warfare all the time on the front page
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:21:24 And before anyone goes "No there's no such thing", I saw a complete asset flip game get over a 95% like/dislike ratio, while the original asset flip got under 50%
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 00:05:25 ...... Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:00:08 ..... Excuse me?

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:38:39 And I'll get the damn shotgun if you don't shut up Sam
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:42:26 It's the queen metroid to be exact if I'm not mistaken
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:43:07 Basically it's a metroid evolution line of all of the metroids found in all of the current games
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:44:33 Katze, mind if I test a 1 minute Dyno mute on you, to see if it works?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:01 We're having troubles with Dyno, if it fails to auto-unmute, I'll manually do it
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:50 Well it works
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:45:52 Thanks Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:46:38 Hey, Dyno's been on the fritz recently, what do you want us to do? Wait till we need it and THEN see if it works?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:47:40 Right, now then

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:55:53 .... <@456226577798135808> , Cut it out, Katze's got a point, just Google it, it's faster than this
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:59:20 Let me take a guess, you blocked Katze?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 01:59:58 ...... That, is pretty much the most petty way of doing something like that, asking them how to do something
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:00:59 Sam, shut it, I barely visit the VC and even I know you've done so ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:01:49 Anti, what did they say?
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:02:02 ... I'm getting deja-vu with this

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:22:17 <@456226577798135808> , I'm just gonna say this once, can you please, for courtesy's sake, NOT post excessively long songs? It's not a specific rule, it's just not courteous
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 02:23:03 Just think, how would you like it if someone did it to you
creations-chat 2019-05-16 02:45:17 <@!240233829200166912> , That's a tutorial VTOL given a magnet drive, isn't it?
creations-chat 2019-05-16 02:45:50 ... Don't copy off of tutorials unless you're taking inspiration of making your own thing
creations-chat 2019-05-16 02:47:18 It's not against any rules or anything, it's just that it's lazy, generally frowned upon, and leads to a very, VERY stunted skill growth

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:23:21 Well, that freaking crash broke the link, and since Dyno didn't record it, I can't send it to Discord (I tried a similar case before, they need hard evidence)
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 03:23:49 Fuck, ing, __***HELL!!!!***__

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:00:32 <@461111372239994881> , you're underage, I have to ask you to leave, now, as per the Discord ToS, and by an (admittedly limited) extent the law, to leave until you're over 13 years old WITH parental permission
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:00:57 Then show evidence that you are, because in the mod logs we have you banned for being under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:01:14 ..... Wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:01:33 Fucking, hold on a moment, the bot's acting up

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:37:03 I remember, didn't log it down since I wasn't the one that banned you I think
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:46:27 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:46:42 Riiiight, I'm making an executive decision
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:47:33 Use this: "Excessive toxicity and repeatedly trolling the server, while harassing multiple members, as well as attempting to falsely frame someone for something they did not do"
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:48:21 __***SHIT***__, forgot that part about Dyno, but basically he tried to frame NooBaris for pinging and harassing him, badly
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:48:39 Yeah, that's fine though
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:49:13 Yeah that tends to happen alot, fair though
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 19:50:21 He's on mobile now, I'm not sure he can
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:06 What happens if you add too much thermal paste?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:35 Google it Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:15:41 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:19:31 Any suggestions for what paste to use for an HP Envy?

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:19:59 Told ya
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 20:20:28 Oh ouch, you gonna be alright Battleship?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 21:55:25 You could, but there'd be very little, if any control offered at all
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:18:15 Damn Turismo, nice cockpit design

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:32 Oh, they're already gone from the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:37 Yeah just forget about that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:44:51 Thanks Linh, that's good enough
bug-reports 2019-05-18 17:46:24 So you can't change half block wedge ups to metal?
bug-reports 2019-05-18 17:46:58 Use the paint tool and/or material tool while placing
bug-reports 2019-05-18 17:47:46 Oh, you mean the halfway between a block and a wedge?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:48:02 Multiple people have done so <@!488791699339083821>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:48:51 For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, that's all I'm going to say
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:49:06 You'll get alot smarter and be more self-dependent if you can figure it out from there
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:30 Surprise surprise: It's actually really weak
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:46 First of all, there's multiple structural weaknesses, second, it's a one-off creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:52:53 I'm, not going to answer that ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:53:14 It's neither a yes nor a no and I'll keep it that way
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:53:46 Nope, neither saying yes or no to that

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:56:39 Terminator, not excuses, I want to hear you fix things
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:56:47 Plus why does your phone even autocorrect to that stuff?

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:57:49 Terminator, no more excuses, if I see that again I'm going to maul you, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:59:16 ..... Terminator, it's an "autocorrect mistake" that broke a rule, I'm going to PRETEND it was a mistake for your sake, but if I see you make another mistake like that I'm going to murder you ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:06:10 Okay, enough Hs people, let's move on
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:06:20 Freaking, I have 3 pages of this stuff with a high resolution
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:18:10 Excuse the slowmode, some of our members need their timers reset due to a bug (Multiple infact), hopefully this'll trick their timers to resetting properly
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:18:26 Apologies for the minor inconvenience for a moment, I set it as low as possible
general 2019-05-18 18:18:52 Yeah, oh, you mean the timer?
general 2019-05-18 18:18:58 FFS
general 2019-05-18 18:19:19 I have no idea what even happened
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:19:25 Didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:19:32 It's for 6 HOURS on some of the guys
general 2019-05-18 18:20:26 Hold on FFS
general 2019-05-18 18:20:47 I'm getting permission to mess with it outside of just tinkering with the timer, I don't want Voxel to get pissy at me for trying to fix this
general 2019-05-18 18:21:18 Wait
general 2019-05-18 18:21:19 Welp
general 2019-05-18 18:21:22 RIP
general 2019-05-18 18:21:37 Solution: Just use this channel instead
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 18:22:09 Yeaaahhhh, multiple people are having problems, they're gonna use <#497142796961054721> as a temporary general
general 2019-05-18 18:22:23 Joey, don't, it's a pain in the freaking arse to do so
general 2019-05-18 18:22:47 It might reset the slowmode timer as far as I know
general 2019-05-18 18:22:57 I've already notified people in <#384021699466756107> about this, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:30:24 <@!540343176314093569> , Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:30:32 That seems dubious, can anyone else confirm if that's a legitimate site?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:25 Yeah that's definitely a scam
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:45 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 19:31:50 Yeup, it was a scam
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:34:47 ..... <@!335617147067957250>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:09 Just tell him to not spread it any further, security reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:12 Anyways, <@!335617147067957250>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:24 <@!335617147067957250> __***GET THE FUCK OVER HERE, NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:34 <@!335617147067957250> YOU have more to answer to
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:35:49 Your friend's fine, as long as he doesn't spread the link, but YOU <@!335617147067957250> HAVE TO ANSWER TO THIS
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:21 You're not allowed to share VIP server links due to security reasons, not to mention it's literally listed in <#533294912586645521>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:40 If I catch you sharing links again, I will permanently remove your access to any and all VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:36:43 I removed it temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:37:23 Now then <@!335617147067957250> , to explain why: We've had multiple trolls appear in our VIP servers, of varrying degrees of malicious, ranging from simply showing off people, to straight up building NSFW creations in order to harass members
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:37:53 So, __***DO NOT***__ share links, there are extraordinarily few, if any exceptions to this rule
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:38:20 Again, don't share it at all, not even with one person
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:38:45 We've had straight up security breaches where one person shared with another, then shared with multiple, and suddenly all the people we've banned from the server for various reasons come back, flooding the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:39:45 Katze, I think he gets it, he's just trying to be nice about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:41:29 There's a variety of problems with 2X2 cylinders, namely centering problems
bug-reports 2019-05-18 20:42:06 He's probably just pointing out that it's still an issue
bug-reports 2019-05-18 20:42:34 Er, nevermind
bug-reports 2019-05-18 20:43:13 Huh, you sure it's the same color? Try one digit lower
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:43:49 .............................
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:43:55 <@285640703550423041> __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:44:06 Right, now then
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:44:48 I __***COULD***__ count it as 2, but I'll be nice and count it as one, hoping that you don't fuck up again
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:05 .... We all know what damn context you had it in, and those that don't know we're trying to shield
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:22 ....... FFS you ruined that word god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:41 But seriously though, don't try that again Jwar
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:45:47 The rules still apply in-game
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:46:18 It's selectively funny, fine, but I still won't allow it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:46:36 Kaaatze, calm down a bit, I'm already dealing with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:47:09 ....... JUST DROP IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:48:27 They really aren't to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:48:35 ....... Drop it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:49:31 Let me be brutally honest here, you don't like/dislike a person, just because of what they like, unless they push it on you, got it? Let whoever the fuck like whatever the fuck, and you'll wind up being liked back
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:49:54 Use a magnet engine on the top and see just how far that thing flies
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:50:29 ..... <@!243731791192522752> I SAID LET PEOPLE LIKE WHATEVER THEY LIKE, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:50:46 ..........................
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:51:03 Oh my fucking,
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:51:07 Excuse me for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:52:39 <@!243731791192522752> , if you're concerned that it's a cesspool, then why are you dumping the waste in it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:53:19 .................... You do realize that they aren't causing any problems now, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:53:36 Again, let people like what they like, so long as they don't affect you
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:54:25 And I'm saying let people like what they like so long as it doesn't fucking affect you kakka, once they START bringing drama in, I'll deal with it, but until then pretend they don't exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:08 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:24 <@!243731791192522752> , Once you have proof that they start becomming invasive, I'll deal with them, until then, drop it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:27 GOT IT!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:55:54 And I don't give a fuck, <@!243731791192522752> , if someone starts causing problems, PING ME, that's what I'm here for
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:56:14 Because Jwar said something not only highly inappropriate, but very aggressive towards someone related to Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:56:39 ... It gives every right to threaten so long as they have no power to actually follow through the threat
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:57:21 ......... <@!243731791192522752> , if it's a fact, then use me to enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:58:20 I'll be the final judge, jury and verdict on these things, so if something comes up, I'll use everything in my power to get the most satisfactory result
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:58:22 .........
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 20:59:07 <@!243731791192522752> , 
1: Empire's right, that's stereotyping on the grounds of "Blacks vs whites"
2: If you were around for any length of time, you'd know that Katze does that mostly to get her point accross
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:00:22 Right, all of you, can we just drop it,
<@!243731791192522752> , don't be a hypocryte, if you want to push your point across, then do so in a positive manner, or with hard, hard evidence and statistics
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:00:56 You're being more toxic than all of the toxicity that I've seen within the last 48 hours in the chat combined, and that's fucking something
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:01:15 Kayn, while it was a joke, it was definitely a joke taken way too far
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:02:20 Right right right right right, __***GUYS***__, can we just drop it for now?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:02:33 I'd rather not have to babysit a massive argument and waste my life away
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:03:40 FFS, cut it out guys, I've seen both sides here
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:04:28 <@!243731791192522752> , I get where you're coming from, yes I have seen the absolute ass end of toxicity, but 
1: That doesn't mean every single one's toxic
2: You don't have to force it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:05:03 Then be better than them
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:06:24 Katze, I already dealt with the problem, no more hostility please
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:06:41 We bother so much about random people because at a certain point those "random" people aren't so random anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:08:09 How'd you even wedge that in there?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:08:22 Not me
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:11:02 Just, why do you want to trash talk exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:12:19 If you can't find a solid answer to that, then maybe you shouldn't do so?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:13:14 If it's about the previous topic, then please, leave it be
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:13:52 We're all already past that, we get your point, we understand where you're coming from, and most of us disagree with it, specifically in the manner that you're trying to enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:14:13 <@!311996873650995200> , I'd imagine it's harder than it looks, but that'd be nice for sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:15:09 ... <@!243731791192522752> , Of the 26 I've met, including the ones in this server, only 5 fit that description, and even then those have at least 1 valid reason for doing so
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:16:25 Just drop it <@!243731791192522752> , you've already pushed your point across as much as you possibly could
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:16:51 And make more people disagree with it, sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:16 So you just want to vent then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:26 Problem with muting people is that they 99% of the time go to DMs
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:17:34 So it's harder to keep track of them
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:16 By all technicalities, it's still following the rules, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:24 ... Sam, <#495286269459300364> for random memes if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:18:31 That has no context in the chat currently, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:19:44 Alright, nice to see this chat winding down to, at least a friendlier portion again
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:19:48 Hidear, box him in
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:21:34 Gold, you can change your username colors ya know
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:23:06 Cool, I've never actually watched the Simpsons, but cool, I'm guessing you like him, judging from how he's also your PFP picture
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:25:42 <@!249373398612967441> , That's gonna be complex, but it's probably doable
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:25:50 Also I'm fine Sam, now could you leave me be?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:26:43 Kayn, whitelisting's likely ABSURDLY hard to perfect
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:27:08 Rick's probably rolling out simpler things to fill the base content first before doing niche and novel things
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:28:02 Probably had something to do
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:28:31 He's a human being to ya know (A rickbot would be epic though)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:29:04 Fucking hell I'm lagging behind Dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:30:19 You lucky little crudder, share it! (Okay nah, most of us have probably retired DQ)
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:31:24 The second one's likely easier to do and balance, but the first one's definitely more interesting, IF you can make it work
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:32:52 "The game only simulates wing physics with the wing panels, and unless you have an upwards thrust, you won't generate lift, which means you won't go up"
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 21:33:57 Nice cockpit design Katze
creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:56:23 You mean the parachute bomb with a green light inside?
creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:56:37 Oh, OOOHHHHH, ropestorm + parachute bomb, yeah no that's pretty scary
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 23:44:18 I'm going to assume that this isn't going to get out of control
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 06:11:29 <@456226577798135808> , Are you talking about this thing, which isn't even oriented properly? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/579548712821587979/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 06:12:34 If so, I have seen fucking bigger, much, MUCH bigger, both in overall volume and ESPECIALLY height, maybe not in length or width tho- .... Uhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:04 Let me be blunt here, none of these are good, I could get my friend to make them in about an hour, they're not well detailed, nor are they mechanically interesting at all
creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:34 No no, just leave them
creations-chat 2019-05-19 07:08:40 Just, develop further next time
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:04:39 <@!257194741815312384> , please no .wmvs, also I can tell you have enough surface space to crry vehicles, I'd suggest getting rid of that small bump though
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:12:53 .... <@!475420992798195712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:13:22 And I'll have you know, I have an XM556, fully loaded, ready to shred whatever the fuck you do
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:01 And unlike you, I have connections, that make people dissapear, either off the face of the internet, or the face of the world
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:12 Now cut it out benis, I don't want to hear some bullshit excuse from you
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:59 That's actually pretty cool <@!243731791192522752> , what about a hat? Or maybe eye guns?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:15:52 <@!475420992798195712> , try spamming excessive again and see what happens, I can kill your damn chat in a heartbeat
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:08 Also I have no idea Rick, maybe we're getting a positive bot wave?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:44 Well, at the very least people are interested in the game, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:14 Closest way to do that <@!243731791192522752> is probably use the guns stacked in a giant line
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:42 So, basically Jail, just a 3X3, but with the shape of a 2X2?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:52 I could get on that to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:19:40 "-dink- .... __***AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!***__"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:19:59 Whaaat? It fits
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:19 <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:31 I was saying what basically happened with this https://gyazo.com/6ef6832a20adfce16185440a69443d55
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:58 Scroll up and copy someone else, except with your own request
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:21:20 God damn it you two (Not in a bad way though)
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:21:40 WHAT!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:22:23 
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:23:09 That's insane, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:03 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:32 Yeup, feel free to observe the ~~occasional bouts of madness~~ tons of creativity here
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:40 Also, yes you are <@!508788110906097719> , as long as it follows the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:25:55 You're allowed to post pretty much anything as long as it follows the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:26:19 Infact, if you want, you can try posting in the competition, check <#504718138399522832> for what's currently going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:26:41 To get ranks from <#544022464133595166> , post a creation in <#504436696021204992> , a bot will automatically port it over to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:27:20 Please don't use .wmv files, we've had multiple virus attacks from those things, and we'd rather not be held responsible or be a victim of one
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:27:30 I mean, go for it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:04 How many missile/torpedo tubes do you have?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:16 Load em all with nukes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:28:55 Reloading any kinetic weapon is HAAARRRRD, especially if the vehicle has other functionalities
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:30:20 That's called a critical hit <@!505835349889777685> , anything can win against anything if you properly ammo rack them
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:30:59 How about make that mega drone from Watchdogs 2, or the spider tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:10 And lift up one of the sizable cars
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:21 Maybe Turismo's?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:31:49 You might be airlifted soon Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:26 This thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:32 Oh, OOOHHH, inventor
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:32:41 I doubt it, people have made bikes before
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:33:19 Doing a rough guestimate of parts, it's around the range of 300, maybe 400 parts in it, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:33:30 The drone's from one of the main missions
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:33:46 Hey <@410164867165716507> , how large is your bomber in terms of parts?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:34:02 Damn, blocks instead of beams?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:34:31 Er, <@353348764280422402> , hold on while I update ya
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:35:37 Also, <@410164867165716507> , you got master engineer, now you can access the VIP servers (Do "!servers" in <#384027830192832513> ), and you can suggest things ("&suggest (Suggestion here)", again, in <#384027830192832513> ), we mostly wait till people are ranked before we give them access to that, so 
1: They don't just steal the VIP link and run
2: We know they actually invest in the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:36:29 <@353348764280422402> , There, should be changed now, unless that's the username of your account as well
bot-central 2019-05-19 17:37:09 By the way <@410164867165716507> , try not to leak links, we've had multiple security issues before
creations-chat 2019-05-19 17:37:31 Turns out it was 1200 something, it's been too long since I last guessed stuff like this
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:38:11 Rick, make an alternate account, get Madattak to verify it's you, and use that alt to hide, tell NOBODY but Madattak about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:38:22 If people run from you, hop on the alt and track them, they won't react to the alt until it's too late
bot-central 2019-05-19 17:38:43 People do tend to try to cause a crapstorm every so often, but that's with every server right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:25 Meh, sod it, I'll join, got nothing else to do
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:35 Also show a diagram Iil?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:39:46 I won't be building though, just flying around mostly
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:45:12 <@!430613089893744654> , guns work in PVP only, but you aim the motor joint part to where you want to shoot
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:45:15 Click and hold to fire
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:49:48 Ah FFS, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:50:04 <@410164867165716507> , use motors to open and close the doors, disconnectors to disconnect bombs
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:50:11 Also please don't upvote your own creations, people really frown upon that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:51:47 No, there's like 90 BILLION gyroscopes out there now
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:56:40 Welp, <@206891768233328640> , __***OFFICIALLY***__ beat my fighter in maneuverability
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:57:56 I think I capitalized on one of the easy ones at the time, since I got in early
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:35 I don't know, this was a VERY early one
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:37 I think I invented a proper vehicle flipper, one which managed to flip stuff many times it's size without using engines or anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:42 Discord's breaking up, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:04:50 That's because things weren't invented yet Grab
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:09 Also admittedly the criteria WAS alot looser back then, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:59 To be honest I don't show people my creation, and it has internal mechanisms as well, so I doubt they'd copy it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:06:21 Dunno, if we knew what wasn't invented, we would've invented it already
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:21:39 ... <@!527302996288077824> Cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:21:55 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:42 <@!527302996288077824> NOW CUT IT OUT
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:51 Those things ARE genuinely spam by the way
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:06 .....
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:22 ?unmute <@!527302996288077824>
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:51 <@!527302996288077824> I, said, cut it, the fuck, out, nobody wants spam in their DMs unless it's a joke from a close friend
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:26 And before you argue "it isn't spam" <@!527302996288077824> , that thing, is made, TO BE SPAM
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:36 I kid you not it is infact meant to be spam ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:27:21 ..... <@!527302996288077824> , I've dealt with multiple types of spam and I can safely say that that meaningless post is infact spam
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:28:36 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:28:51 It is infact made to be spam, he's just trying to point it out so I won't hang him for THAT one, but still
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:29:10 Ehhhh, sorsry <@!323110865140449282> , I'm not sure it's unique enough
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:35:06 ....... <@!527302996288077824> , I'm getting very tired of your antics, now cut it out, or so help me I will personally erase "bob" from the entirity of the internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 20:40:46 It's called "People are stupid"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 20:41:39 Problem with that theory Grab is that it's not severe enough, bot attacks would be WAY more severe
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:22:23 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:22:54 Good thing I didn't convert huh?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:24:07 Needed motors, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:40:50 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:41:06 <@!486674992981999648> , <@456226577798135808> , BOTH OF YOU, SHUT IT
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:41:21 Right what the fuck's going on, one of you at a time, tell me, calmly, what happened on your end
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:02 Wait, how though?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:19 That's, odd, he doesn't have Btools or anything, so, the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:27 Internal mag detonation or something? Did you have explosives?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 21:42:52 I have no idea then
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 23:22:33 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 23:27:40 G'night Rick
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:39:43 <@!421848903361757184> , is it closed?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:39:52 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:25 I think it's sorta slang for like a juvenile prisoner
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:54 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:40:56 Yeah, Comcast has been murdering it's self today
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:43:38 I've had my connection drop like 30 times today, I'm not even exaggerating that, admittedly they were brief periods, but they were enough to disconnect me from whatever I was doing
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:20 Soooo, all in all, fuck Comcast
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:21 IT JUST DROPPED RIGHT THERE
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 00:44:33 Seeya, good luck with those Lego
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:09:38 ..... Seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:09:57 And don't self-upvote
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:11:21 They count AGAINST you
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:11:59 Nothing so far, if guns are a problem, outmaneuver them
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:14:10 You do realize <@!324707302470844416> , that visually appealing creations don't really fit in PVP?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:14:33 Many of us have tried, almost none have succeeded
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 01:51:12 "Almost none", doesn't mean it's impossible
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:44:56 FFS, pay attention to the "almost" part?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 02:45:13 Okay that is a pretty nice F-14 to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:06 ....... You know I could basically ban both of you, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:08 Quit reposting that
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:56:29 I am going to turn around, and pretend nothing happened, and I don't want to hear this happen again, I expect all of that to be erased when I'm done
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:57:02 <@456226577798135808> , What's broken about them exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:58:36 We keep on trying to fix it, and Roblox keeps on updating physics, now be patient
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 03:59:59 <@!184819059404046336> .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 04:00:17 They'd better be day-long breaks
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 04:41:17 It's more like it simply goes to sleep
creations-chat 2019-05-20 06:08:16 Hey <@!324707302470844416> , Congrats on the rankings
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:52:17 We mostly ignore people if they act mature, but if they act immature, then we ask questions
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:53:17 <@!579804769401700363> , Yes, true, but we can't catch them all, so we do need to cut corners every so often, plus it's also good for the community that we ignore SOME, not all
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:56:20 The problem is Morgaxn, you either get it, or you don't, there's practically no exceptions
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:56:40 If you get it, fabulous, you're going to have an amazing time, if you don't, it's probably not for you anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:57:31 .... Uhhh, <@193734403136946176> , <#495286269459300364> please, that has little to no context in this environment currently
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 19:58:18 That's probably because we're getting a bunch of new players joining who are genuinely interested
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:00:38 The last time Madattak talked was 4 months ago, and he only has 3 pages of chat in here, the last page only being 2 things
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:01:31 Okay no that's a horrible idea <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:02:38 Sadly I don't think so Rick
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:03:12 Wait, how? I don't even see those tabs
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:06 <@!260544767446745088> , The problem is people can see your tag, relatively easily, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:36 I guess it's a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:38 I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:08:57 I mean he said it to point out that someone else has it I guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:16:30 Uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:16:45 I'm just gonna, back outa this
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:18:55 You're really proud of that aren't you Rick?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:15 This is what I see
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:21 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:26 
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:19:41 Soooo, yeaaahhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 20:20:22 HOW!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:15 <@456226577798135808> , If you've got a moment, we have reason to believe you're under 13, if this is true, please immediately leave Discord, as we have to enforce their terms of service, which cause legal issues
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:20 <@477314165850243075> , <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:20:53 <@456226577798135808> , If you do not comply, you or your parents may be fined, and even outright arrested, even with parental permission, so please, leave immediately if you are under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:21:30 I mean, it's true, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:21:56 We legally can not allow people we know that are under 13 years old on our server without getting varrying consequences
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:21 Anyways, Gavin, show us what you've made
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:38 Just take screenshots and show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:22:41 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:33 I already confirmed you're over 13, that's just using the inspect element to change the text
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:43 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:24:54 I'm pretty much the only guy that's fine with pinging at almost, if not all hours
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:25:41 There's a variety of ways, namely their behavior, their web link, page link, in-game as well as other ways
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:26:01 I'd say finish it probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:28:34 Huh, nice amount of detail in the engine <@477314165850243075>
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:28:54 You can't delete slots <@!511279873877213188> , you CAN save empty plots over them though
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:29:10 Save an empty plot over them, that's your way of "deleting"
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:29:36 Just do what you need to do to delete it, you'll get the save data back
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:32:14 Just google "Hexadecimal color converter"
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:38 <@!323110865140449282> , mechanism, not just novelty
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:50 Actually, hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:38:54 I might've thought of an idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:39:25 It's decent, but boxy to be honest, nice touch with the people though
plane-crazy 2019-05-20 23:52:45 Okay that is just mesmerizing
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:15:58 ..... <@!396508970761715712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:16:14 Erase that, __***NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:16:30 I don't give a fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:09 It's called fucking rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:14 ?Warnings <@!396508970761715712>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:50 .... Go back and read <#533294912586645521> before you make another damn quip
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:17:59 ?warnings <@318892614378061824>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:05 Exceeeept, what warns?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:14 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:18:28 What are you talking about!? (Yes I did erase it, thanks for pointing that out)
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:19:43 It's not the spoiler that bugged me
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:19:54 Also some people have very busy lives
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:21:29 Good luck <@!250393834817585162>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:15 All I can say is good luck, what's effective on paper might not be effective in practice
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:31:34 <@!364352162563883008> , pretend Rick's got a limited supply of money, every day he gets it all back, but he doesn't have an infinite amount, then you'll realize just why he doesn't hurl out all the parts constantly
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:21:27 You don't "delete" stuff per-se, you save an empty slot, Rick's adding a delete button for people who don't get it though
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:22:20 ....
1: How old are you?
2: What don't you get?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:22:51 <@!383653454502952960>
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:23:15 Let me explain
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:23:36 <@!383653454502952960> , you're technically knowingly violating the law by staying on here, as Discord Terms of Service have made it so you can't stay on unless you've over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:13 So I'd suggest you leave now, before I contact authorities to branch over and give you, or your parents a large fine, aka: They need to pay money, for having broken the law
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:35 Look, it's not in our power to adjust it, even if we wanted to, so I'd suggest you just leave
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:24:58 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:25:47 The last part's a bluff, I'm not ACTUALLY going to call them, that'd be just mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:25:53 But it should get him to shut the fuck up and snap out of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:27:29 I really hate dumbasses like that kid, seriously, I know they've got fucking common sense developed at that point because I've seen some of my really young cousins act better than he does
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:28:29 Then he shouldn't act like he's 6, hell, he acted like he was fucking 3
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:29:44 You can't see his roles, can you <@318892614378061824> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:29:55 Hey, Le Bote was a fantastic game
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:21 Exactly, that means that he's gone from the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:38 Also, I always loved to just sail around in this giant "Fuck off and die" battleship that practically nobody can hit
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:30:46 It's definitely against the rules
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:32:27 I'm actually cooperating with Mark on another game
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:12 This Mark to be exact by the way Empire, thought you'd be curious https://www.roblox.com/users/907754/profile/
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:36 Part of the Warships dev team
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:33:44 At least, I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:34:53 Look, see?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:35:44 Yeah, apparently I'm getting in alot of dev groups recently
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:36:57 HAH, no, sadly I'm moreso a design dev than an actual coding dev, I can tweak the balance of a game to feel fabulous, but that's pretty much it
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:37:05 ~200ish, something like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 01:37:39 I mean, so far I've managed to knock one guy off of the "pay to win" mentality
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 02:14:24 ?help
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 02:14:27 Nope, it's alive
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:03:22 Meh, the problem with making engines too powerful is that it makes creations too easy
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:22:27 It only logs chat down every minute or so though, so if you say something every frame, you're not gonna get further than the person that talks every minute
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:45:34 <@!492852732609298433> , Can we __***HELP YOU!?***__, you're spamming the David guy constantly
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:12 Wait, seriously Terminator?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:27 Uhhhh, hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:38 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:46:52 <@!492852732609298433> , quit trying to poke into people's personal information and/or spamming
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:47:11 Then the fuck is, I don't even,
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:47:29 <@!435464209677942784> , <@!492852732609298433> WHATEVER'S GOING ON, BOTH OF YOU FIGURE IT OUT AND CUT IT OUT NOW FOR FUCK'S SAKE
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 19:48:04 I'm not having a good day is the thing
creations-chat 2019-05-22 18:42:51 Hey <@410164867165716507> , you got the rank
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:01 ..... Right what the fuck's going on over here?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:10 Guys, break down the arguments and tell me what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:04:17 .... <@!486947728320888842> Cut it out, now
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:05:21 THAT, is how you give someone a slap across the face
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:10 The remade Le-Bote
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:17 I think 240 something
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:27 Yeah, battleships are inaccurate as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:29 Well
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:39 If they hit you're as good as fucking dead, and they're good against carriers
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:06:46 But yeah, battleships are hella-inaccurate
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:07:13 It's called linking up your spam with someone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:07:25 Damn, nice catch
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:08:14 I just use a fully decked out battleship with the highest DPS weapons I can get (Sometimes I regret the lack of AA though, damn carriers)
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:15 I have 3 AA on each side of the battleship, I'd go for more, but that'd leave me defenseless against subs, or I'd have to reduce my cannon firepower
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:42 Same here Hidear
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:09:59 Ever fought the Atlantis? That was my personal ship, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:08 To be honest I've sorta lost interest in Le Bote, but if you're interested Hidear, https://www.roblox.com/games/1825841556/ALPHA-Le-bote-Rebooted
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:31 It was a fully decked out battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:47 Also the targetting system's different between Le Botes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:11:53 Not in the remake, the original
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:11 In the old Le Bote, it aimed for where you were going, assuming your turning as well as your speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:28 In the new one, it aimed for where you're going, I believe assuming zero turning
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:42 I'm not sure, all I know is I know how to maneuver in order to evade shots perfectly
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:12:50 I can dodge broadsides from 7K away
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:13:23 A battleship, dodging another battleship's broadsides, from 7K away, let that sink in for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:14:34 The thing is, speed is taken into consideration
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:14:42 I won't say how, but I will say they are taken into consideration
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 19:15:10 I don't want my secret to get out for dodging shots, so I'll say it via whisper
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:04 <@!456408386330689537> , Uhhhh, could you please respond ASAP? We need a talk about the ToS
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:11 No you haven't done anything bad, just, we need to talk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:15:57 For fuck's sake Kayn
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:16:13 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:19:17 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:20:05 Let's see what you've got
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:20:59 What the fu- are you, what!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:21:20 <@!279641544749875223> , HOW did you expect that to fly!? What the actual fuck!? (Forgive me, but I'm surprised to hell)
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:07 Right right right right right, first of all, too few wing surfaces, it's not going to work, at all
Second of all, alot of thrust at the top, not alot at the bottom
Third: Not enough control surfaces, and no vertical control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:19 Just HOW is that the Hydra!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:40 __***THIS***__https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/c/c4/Hydra-GTAO-FrontQuarter.png/revision/latest?cb=20171009200520
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:22:48 __***THIS, IS THE HYDRA***__ https://www.gtabase.com/images/gta-5/vehicles/planes/hydra.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:07 I'm sorry <@!279641544749875223> , but that's not a hydra
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:13 Like, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:18 <@!279641544749875223> , no
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:23:57 First of all, wrong positions, second of all, no proper wings, third, no tail, fourth, no cockpit, fifth, no front propeller
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:18 <@!279641544749875223> , a Hydra fighter is based off of a harrier
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:44 Okay okay no please convert it out of a .wmv
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:24:50 .wmv files can harbor viruses
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:26:13 But anyways though, <@!279641544749875223> , you didn't design a harrier/hydra, infact, the last time we've been graced with something like that was back in mid 2018ish
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:26:48 ... <@!279641544749875223> , it's just, it's so, so hard to maintain a straight face basically when something like that happens
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:10 Okay okay but seriously though let's get to maybe some actual feedback
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:49 <@!279641544749875223> , The closest thing you've probably made is a Star Destroyer, https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-0kvv9/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/288792/406014/apiqlnwst__99662.1550860781.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:27:52 https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/Star-Destroyer_ab6b94bb.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1600%2C900&width=960
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:28:11 And the thing is <@!279641544749875223> , it's not actually a good design
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:28:21 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:12 What do you mean by "super mad"?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:31 Did you check if the wheels were properly assigned?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:48 Then use the purple screwdriver tool to inspect the wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:29:56 Just show us
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:14 ... <@!279641544749875223> , just SHOW US
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:26 Other side?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:30:38 Okay okay okay let's not assume ages yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:31:01 ......... <@!279641544749875223> , I'm trying not to ask questions but at the same time you're making it very hard to do so
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:31:45 The tutorial gives you a basic grasp on the flight mechanics of the game, everything else you need to learn on your own
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:32:28 Wrong james <@!279641544749875223>
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:33:23 So far I've learned folding, turrets, swing-wings, adjustable motor speeds, monoblade helis, and tracks, as well as the ability to balance out ultra-large crafts with little to no adjustment blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:34:45 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , that's it, I need you to show in-game proof you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:35:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:35:10 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:23 Yes yes I know Esio, shush
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:43 ..........
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:36:54 <@!279641544749875223> , nobody's going to peg him for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:40:28 .... Right, <@!279641544749875223> , if this is a joke, stop it, now, it's lost it's humor a long time ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:40:55 ............ How, are you so, I don't even, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:06 Let me be very, very, blunt, and admittedly rude
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:11 How are you so fucking stupid?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:20 Like, I can't even,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:21 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:34 Okay maybe tone it back a bit Figors
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:41:57 ... <@!279641544749875223> , just, right, let me be, very, very clear
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:42:49 We are legally not allowed to have people under 13 years old on this server, if you are under 13  years old, you need to leave, now, or else we are legally obliged to contact authorities branch by branch to fine and/or arrest you and/or your parents
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:05 I'm not actually sure to WHAT extent there is, but I do know there's legal consequences if you're under 13 years old on Discord
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:04:27 Orange, back up a bit, let me handle this
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:05:10 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , you've given nothing to the chat except a great big headache, and you've been nothing more than toxic towards everyone in multiple ways
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:04 <@!279641544749875223> , we reserve every right to boot you from the server, for good, if you don't stop being a general nuisance to everyone
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:39 ........
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:06:50 Give me a moment, can all of you back off for a moment?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:07:26 Right, <@!279641544749875223> , we've answered your question to the best of our abilities, however, it's an extraordinarily basic question that even the average player of Roblox understands, which is quite the miracle to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:05 That's because it's a question that my 6 year old cousin knew, even without playing the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:32 <@!279641544749875223> , It's something so, blatantly simple, that even 6 year old children understood it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:08:43 Not to mention you could experiment with it yourself
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:09:27 .... <@!279641544749875223> , that's one reason why we called you a troll
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:19 Okay that's it, <@!279641544749875223> , shut it, now
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:48 You're starting to break down to just throwing general shit around in a vague attempt at being superior to everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:10:57 Lego, I'd suggest backing out for about 5, maybe 10 or 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:11:38 So, <@!279641544749875223> , are you going to act like a decent human being, or are you just going to constantly whine about things that my 6 year old cousin gets, and pretend you're the only one that needs to be listened to?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:11:51 Because the latter's what you've been doing as far as I've seen you on here
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:12:23 Then first things first, accept 2/3 of the warns as a reminder of the shitstorm you've thrown in here, and get over it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:12:49 I know you two, just,
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:10 I'm not saying 3/3 because that's just booting him from the server, nor 1/3 because this was both really irritating and nearly kicked up a giant shitstorm
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:26 Right, Dyno's awake again, let's get to it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:41 .... Dyno why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:13:48 ?clearwarn <@!279641544749875223>
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:14:31 <@!279641544749875223> , There, just feel lucky that I was in a semi-nice mood
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:14:39 Well, it works out close enough anyways Robo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:15:12 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , why, did you feel the need to pull that up exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:15:51 .... Very well then I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:16:29 To be honest each of us have a different personality that generally leans towards "We're nice", but the problem is when people constantly cause trouble
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:17:28 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , can you NOT say it in an excessively rude manner? You're literally stuffing in words just to make it even ruder than it needs to be
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:07 Right, the reason we thought you were trolling <@!279641544749875223> , is because you kept on asking extraordinarily basic questions, that can be figured out simply by experimenting with the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:46 Kazr, that's not a good path to learning
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:18:54 The best way to learn is to learn it on your own
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:19:42 ..... <@!279641544749875223> , learning it on your own lets the information sink in, and I'm not saying this just out of speculation, I'm saying it out of experience
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:19:55 Namely in this game, maybe not other games, but definitely in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:20:59 It's called a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:21:44 ........ Right, I'm taking a heath break, one of you take over, break his face if you need to, honestly I've burned out trying to be patient
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:23:48 Well, hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:24:54 <@!279641544749875223> , sadly we don't have any in-game power, only Madattak and Rickje have in-game powers, post a screenshot in <#478584971670454284> of what you need help with, then we'll judge if he needs to be banned or not
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:25:43 Katze, calm down a bit
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:01:42 <@456226577798135808> , it's called Rick has a limited amount of time, so you can't have every single nice thing in the universe
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:00 <@!319971087599271936> , Can we help you exactly? ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:20 First of all, how old are you, I need to ask for legal reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:13:49 .... Please exit the server immediately, due to Terms of Service updates, it's illegal to be under 13 years old, even with parental permission
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:10 ........ Are you really?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:20 If so, why'd you ask such a specific number?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:14:47 "Is 9 legal", why 9?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:16:01 .... <@!319971087599271936> , if you are under 13 years old, again, leave, immediately, you and/or your parents can be fined or even arrested if you remain here
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:16:32 Prove it, if you're over 13 you'll know how
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:17:09 Show a screenshot or something ...
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:18:26 <@!319971087599271936> , we do this with people we believe to be under 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:18:46 And from the first 4 things you've said, you haven't exactly made it seem like you're of proper age
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:19:14 Because THIS, doesn't seem of age
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 02:19:48 Just, take an in-game screenshot of the player list
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:18:43 Alright then, let me check
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:19:06 Nice design by the way, gonna be pretty hard to knock that thing loose
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:20:00 You probably know the drill for being ranked, no sharing VIP link, no bad suggestions please (We've had a few recently, not pointing out which ones though), yada yada
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:20:06 Anyways, enjoy the rank
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:25:29 Done
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:26:34 <@221487880487436288> , weren't you banned for something? I don't have a note on you
creations-chat 2019-05-23 20:28:06 Well, whatever reason you were banned for, you're unbanned now, don't do it again
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 21:07:17 I mean, so far it's getting better, at the very least they're putting in effort to attempt to keep the promise
general 2019-05-23 22:27:10 <@!429665143677255681> , I think you can override that, click "more info"
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:30:05 ... Who are you <@!370736084306493441> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:30:58 Check the mod chat
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:31:54 Anyways, welcome <@!370736084306493441> , feel free to wander around, just please don't cause trouble, we get enough of it as it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 00:32:12 Voxel's in a joking mood so it seems
help 2019-05-24 02:40:03 Always on/off?
help 2019-05-24 02:40:22 Well, with always on/off you need to hold down the key
help 2019-05-24 02:40:41 I have no idea then
help 2019-05-24 02:40:50 Show the F9
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 13:58:17 I mean, considering the amount of original builds he makes, he's pretty good on that front
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:43:44 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:43:57 Katze, why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 14:44:11 Just cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:04:03 ...... The fuck, is going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:04:18 I'm not in the mood for this, so calmly, and clearly, explain it to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:26 <@456226577798135808> , Let people like what they like, or so help me I'll fucking burn your eyes so you never have to see another "furry" thing ever again
<@!486674992981999648> , be less aggressive for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:31 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:05:57 <@456226577798135808> , I believe, for your own sake, that, at most, you mean "humanity", not "__***WHITE***__ race"
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:06:33 .......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:07:16 __***NOW FUCKING STOP DIPSHIT, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:07:44 Bad idea Terminator
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:01 But anyways, <@456226577798135808> , I'm mostly warning for that damn excuse to try to cover it up
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:23 Sadly no Battleship
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:34 Something tells me it's a joke Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:08:57 It's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:09:00 Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:10:02 Send it here and we'll be the judge of that Rob
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 20:19:01 Impressive control, although I'll leave it up to the others, I'm not a rocket expert, and I'm in a very bad mood today
bot-central 2019-05-24 20:36:21 Give it a moment
bot-central 2019-05-24 20:36:25 Probably just got overloaded
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:24:55 Right, I blink on here and I see talks of banning, the fuck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:25:12 Someone run me through a TL;DR if they'd please I'm on a bit of a time crunch here
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:25:42 IiI's just trying to help Katze
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:25:56 ?warnings <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:26:29 Now cut it the fuck out, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:26:35 I shouldn't have to do this TWICE damn it
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:26:52 ......
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:27:03 <@456226577798135808> , How about I just ban you instead then?
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:27:15 Because you're cycling warns

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 05:57:12 I am honestly not in the mood for this
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:06 Katze ...
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:37 Let me just be blunt here Katze: You're a BIT aggressive recently, maybe wind down and take a break
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:00:45 Raptor, you're not helping
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:01:31 ..... Are you intentionally just trying to piss off people until someone snaps at you and one of the mods gets called to ban you?
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:08 ..........
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:40 That much is obvious raptor
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:02:53 That wasn't a complement ...
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:42 I get it Turismo
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:48 It won't be me though
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:03:51 Aggression, that's why
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:04:50 Isn't that what you openly admitted to <@!508314435945889802> ?
the-dump 2019-05-27 06:05:15 
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 06:08:28 Katze ...
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:46:58 Fucking hell <@!302698900521877504> , well done, that's modeler-worthy and pretty much blasts out the gate with 33 upvotes (Discluding bot and countered by downvotes) in a single day
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:56:00 Trust me, in the voting market, it's very hard to get people to do stuff, hence why master designer's only 20 instead of something like 50
creations-chat 2019-05-27 14:57:32 Well give us the completed version and watch the crowd go wild
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:19:27 .... <@!325712842487627779> __**HEY**__

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 20:33:39 Hi Turismo
help 2019-05-27 23:15:20 <@!208764105681666049> , Think of every action like levers, the further away from the center they are, the more force is applied
help 2019-05-27 23:15:43 Technically less speed yes, but considering how much air resistance those wings put up, more force basically equals more speed
help 2019-05-27 23:16:07 Having the affecting surfaces farther from the center of mass will help
help 2019-05-27 23:16:36 Hence why if you need to dedicate one axis to things, you dedicate pitch to the front and back-most wings, roll to the edges of the main wings, and yaw (obviously) to the tail
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 23:20:54 Welp, <@!255361087262818304> , everyone loves your grill
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 23:22:49 You know what? Let me try
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 23:23:35 Prep your crud for lag

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 23:31:05 I got flung from there
help 2019-05-27 23:33:53 You get alot more force out of them
help 2019-05-27 23:37:46 Too much backwards lift, if the lift is behind the center of mass, you pitch downwards
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:39:53 That's the second time FFS
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:40:17 God damn it, <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:40:27 OH GOD DAMN IT BOTH OF YOU!!!
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:40:57 It's not allowed because they're extraordinarily busy usually

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:57:59 He's already booted from the server
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 20:58:13 Tell him people are relaying him over, and if he continues he's going to wind up perma-banned from the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:17:58 I don't own Minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:40:56 ..... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:41:09 What's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:42:01 ..... <@!508788110906097719> , I'm going to pretend you didn't do that, because you seemed to recognize it was bad, but if you do it again I will lynch you with a roll of barbed wire, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:42:45 Yes yes I get it, now just drop it
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:42:52 I'm already letting you off the hook
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 22:44:50 It's some weird soul inside of body bullcrap, or so I'm going to assume

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 22:16:32 You do realize that that'd result in a ban, right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 22:16:48 Look again
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 19:45:54 ..... By technicalities, no, but <@!249373398612967441> , there's a thing called <#495286269459300364> you know
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:12 .... Excuse me <@!531625591380770831> ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:17 Wait are you actually 11?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:31 <@!531625591380770831> , I need a yes/no answer from you
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:47 .......... Are you, or are you not under 13 years old?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:04:56 FFS, everyone always says "im 14" when they're underage
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:02 Just, Enqrises, we need to be sure
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:19 It's due to Discord Terms of Service that it's now a legal issue for us to find out
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:05:34 If you aren't 13 years old or older, even with parental permission, you can get into legal troubles
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:06:16 Alright then
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:09:03 <@!531625591380770831> , legal reasons, read Discord ToS
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:10:20 Roblox in-game chat? You do realize people can just smack photos on here, right? We aren't 100% foolproof
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:10:30 We have rules that people will follow
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:10:37 Uhhh, I'd stay on the safe side and say, yes, that's not allowed
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:11:04 ............ <@!435464209677942784> __***EXPLAIN, NOW***__
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:11:22 Wait

plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:13:03 Well, you record his roles Imperial, my folder's actually ridiculously full of people's roles
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:06 It's mostly for Plane Crazy servers sadly
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:15 And even then it's been too chaotic trying to manage every single VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:30 Hence why we went from a "#servers" channel to just doing "!servers"
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:36 And why we went from like 30 servers to 2
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 23:15:45 Enqrises, all profile info is public ya know

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:33:54 At the very least it's a euphemism
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:34:06 And I don't give a damn what you say about it, it's the strictest rule we need to enforce
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:34:10 I GET IT
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:34:25 Plus why did you act so absurdly odd about it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:34:53 Don't whine about us having minds in the gutter when you act so absurd about something like that

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:40:01 To be honest I really, really don't like it when people obsess over me
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:40:28 If you've seen me shout at colonel, you'll know my attitude towards that stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 04:41:17 Look, if you don't like it, sorry, but after the first or second time it's just really creepy to me
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:48:43 ............. Please tell me this is one big joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:48:52 Not the pride thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:48:54 I don't mind about that

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:51:38 As long as it's a joke, it's not a problem, but it must be clearly distinct as a joke

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:53:56 <@!351809528209080324> , I don't give a damn, it's called being a horrible human being
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:54:37 Then how would you like it if I enacted some dark humor on you <@!351809528209080324> ? Preferably with a bit of skull fragments entering your brain
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:54:47 If you aren't fine with that, then you shouldn't be fine with dark humor
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:55:16 Alright then, enjoy dark humor for one day, your roles are saved by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:55:47 Okay but seriously he did have 3 warns
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:56:04 This won't count against him by the way

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:57:02 Yeah well so far I haven't seen him do anything of the sort, so I'd say he's refreshed at least
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:57:20 <@461111372239994881> , Long story short, both Discord and Roblox will (metaphorically) hang us, if we let people post NSFW on here
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:57:31 Euphemisms count to, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 17:58:24 No, I think it's just bad english

plane-crazy 2019-06-01 18:00:06 Right, <@461111372239994881> , what he's referring to is how euphemisms count towards the NSFW rule nowadays
plane-crazy 2019-06-01 18:00:39 Alvin, autism isn't an excuse you know

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 03:07:27 Those Who Remain
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 03:07:44 It's a wave based zombie shooter that gets REALLY intense, where actual progression matters
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 03:07:57 I think I stopped when I got the AK (It was worth it)
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 03:08:52 Expect to be roflstomped at first Legendary, and also go for guns that have high pierce, you need crowd control more than anything else
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 03:12:33 Just select an end-game gun and see how powerful it is compared to the beginner gun
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:26:51 <@!486674992981999648> , it actually looks like a Z-95 Headhunter believe it or not

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:28:19 "wing, fuselage and cockpit design are surprisingly similar at least"
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:28:24 Hi Inferno
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:29:02 Can
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:29:03 You
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:29:04 Speak

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:29:43 Okay, that aside, it looks like a freaking Toxeed tutorial plane with a sprinkle of wedges
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:30:07 <@456226577798135808> , that gets you permanently banned from ever having ranks ever, and potentially a tempban from the server, due to the fact that copying is so frowned upon
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:31:08 Your creation <@!531625591380770831> , is small, uninteresting, and can't fly under it's own natural volition
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:32:27 If you aren't willing to put in the effort to make it perfect, you won't have the effort to make it at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:32:57 I mean, for making it in one day Katze, it is pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:43 This thing took a design vision as well as a week's worth of constant investment to make it function the same as my Wyverns, which as I've mentioned, only Turismo has ever beaten
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:51 
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:33:56 So, to make something like that in one day Katze, that's kinda impressive
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:34:43 I'm guessing two of the wheels give force, the other two rotate to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:34:59 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:08 Oh yeah you can even see the front axle turn
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:28 I've got spectacle creep Empire, whatever I make now I feel like has to be better than the previous creations in some way, shape and/or form
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:35:33 And so far I've got no ideas coming to mind
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 18:36:30 I mean, I did try to make an interceptor lineup, I scrapped it on the first one though
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 20:21:31 .... <@!272125457703501826> , SERIOUSLY!?

plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:43:29 But the ultimatum was going to be a 5 minute mute for whoever continued on, increasing by 5 minutes for each person muted, and at every interval of 30, I would've issued a warn alongside it
plane-crazy 2019-06-02 22:46:41 He petittioned, showed proof of growth (At least via DMs), and various stuff

plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:04:29 It's Russian, I have a friend that speaks Russian and it matches perfectly
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:05:20 OKAY OKAY OKAY ENOUGH RUSSIAN IT'S HARD TO MANAGE
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:05:50 Fonkl, be sure to ask nicely, you'd be surprised at how ineffective pure force is
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:16:06 <@!302698900521877504> , Can you please NOT leak the VIP server link? At least verify it with us beforehand, because we don't want VIP servers to be filled with trolls
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:16:44 Hi, bye
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:18:56 Slow, still, confirm with one of us
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:19:28 We need to make sure somebody doesn't just up and ruin VIP 1, that's why we've made it so you need a rank to access it
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:21:56 Then don't share the VIP server link, at the very least let us know before inviting them so we can discuss it
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:22:50 It's, complicated
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:23:04 We don't have a solid white line where one side's allowed and the other isn't
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:23:13 That's the primary difficulty
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 15:24:23 Er, don't, blame me for this
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 16:09:48 Uhhhhh, what?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:53:16 What is it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:54:14 The hardest part is tied between monitoring the server for anything going batshit crazy, and making judgement calls without being too preferential to one person or another
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:56:39 Guys ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:57:09 Actually nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:41:43 Fucking hell <@!206045239348166656> , CHANGE YOUR PFP ALREADY
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:42:02 Why do you think I was kicking you over and over again?
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:42:08 This is a ROBLOX server
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:12 Not exactly nicely Katze
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:34 But seriously just change your PFP ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:43:48 And if it's something even worse, don't bother coming back till tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:44:01 5 minutes ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:46:33 I see it, it's fine, I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 01:47:01 If anyone else finds it's NSFW though, you're going to be banned for a long, long while
creations-chat 2019-06-06 01:52:24 Iron cross is fine, just not the swastika
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:01:44 <@456226577798135808> , It definitely was really offensive to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:03:47 Is that seriously the TNI thing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:04 A war group
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:20 A very scummy one at that to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:04:35 They're basically a pyramid scheme fueled by Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:02 I was in two, got highest merits in both, even when the highest ranks had benefits (Most notably one group had extremely powerful tanks for their higher ranks to use for free), and they didn't bat an eye at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:22 Meanwhile some dipshit that joined a day later gets a higher rank, just because he spent money on the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 06:06:31 They aren't military groups, they're pyramid schemes
the-dump 2019-06-06 20:36:10 .... <@!299947216641064960>
the-dump 2019-06-06 20:45:39 It was NSFW Reddy, don't deny it, I already deleted it ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 19:49:04 <@!311996873650995200> , that fighter doesn't have enough armor to survive any amount of firepower, and with the technique of rotary spread, there's no way to evade every single shot, so it's a worthless fighter in that regard (Not to mention modern CWIS fire will rip it to pieces)
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:05:39 Did you build it pointing the other way around or something?
bug-reports 2019-06-07 20:12:09 Look where the arrow's pointing, did you build the fighter in reverse?
creations-chat 2019-06-07 23:10:08 Tutorials are highly frowned upon, although if you're the first verified person to make the tutorial, you'll be fine, but if ANYONE ELSE is found with the creation at an earlier date, you'll be shot on the spot (metaphorically of course)
general 2019-06-07 23:13:26 Voxel, permission to change this channel's name to something more fitting?
general 2019-06-07 23:13:56 It's still gonna be related to KSP
general 2019-06-07 23:14:14 I was thinking "Kerbal Crazy", considering most people do KSP stuff here
general 2019-06-07 23:14:37 I mean, it's up to you in the end Voxel
general 2019-06-07 23:14:46 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:44:24 Guys, can you fucking leave stuff behind? If drama happens in another server, don't drag it here
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:44:36 That means you two <@!368630214747619340> <@!365207262987550720>
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:44:43 And whoever else is involved in it
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:45:10 ...... I glanced over at the modlogs, __***REALLY <@!368630214747619340> !? REALLY!?***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:45:16 ......... <@!368630214747619340> HEY!
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:45:30 I know
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:51:27 <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 00:59:54 Fucking hell, just send a screenshot of the part count here
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:23:59 ?clearwarn <@438884464060399630>
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:24:07 There, NOW they're cleared
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 05:25:17 Do not ask
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 05:25:34 I just, need this, do not ask guys
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 05:36:10 The chat just tends to be a bit sleepier during these times
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:47:44 I can't take a fucking health break without this shit happening ... God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:48:24 Guys, it's called COMMON, FUCKING, SENSE, use some for fuck's sake, this is a Roblox server, while we're a TINY bit more lenient than Roblox it's self, we still need to make it very child friendly
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:50:36 Pictures are an absolute no-go, cropped pictures count just the same if anyone recognizes them, and people will probably recognize them
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:52:41 Fuck's sake, <@!242650210583576576> , let people like what they like
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:53:08 If they try to push it on you, THEN shout for us, but let people like what they like
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:53:41 <@!403911797532262401> , No .wmv files please, they may contain viruses, use a GIF converter, and if you don't have one, use Google to look for one
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:54:11 It's fine, alot of people make the .wmv mistake
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:54:27 Which makes it even harder to separate the viruses from the real deal .wmvs
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:54:42 Remember what it ORIGINALLY was?
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:55:33 I mean, let's face it, EA's a cash grab at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:56:12 Dunno, also, anyone remember this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite:_Save_the_World
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:56:24 HEY HEY HEY, just look at it first before screaming Esio
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 19:56:58 I remember that was the original one that came out, and if I recall correctly, no lootboxes, no nada
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:57:15 Lower left hand corner, next to the textbox, you should see a + symbol
creations-chat 2019-06-08 19:57:25 If it's a GIF, you put it there, or you put the GIF link in the text
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 20:18:26 ?ban 427159847268646932 Preemptive ban, in Bribbleco (zKevin's server, CubeCavern and such), he spammed GIFs that crashed people
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 20:18:55 It's what it says, he spammed gifs that crashed people, I just preemptively banned him incase he joined here
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:21:51 <@438884464060399630> !!!!
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:22:06 I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE A BREAK WITH ASSHATS LIKE YOU MESSING EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING UP <@438884464060399630>

plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:23:04 I swear to god guys
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:23:08 Not today, just, not today
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:23:44 I'm going to turn around, and pretend none of this is happening (Aside from Furious because he already was warned for it once and he didn't stop), but if I see any more in-game bypassing, I'm going to fucking hang someone (Not literally)
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:25:24 <@438884464060399630> Do I need to reinstate the last warn, since you didn't learn at all whatsoever?
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:27:50 <@438884464060399630> , 3 fucking times, I fucking doubt it's your friend
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 21:28:00 And guys fucking calm down please
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:30:46 So wait, you're basically saying you can look at a picture, analyze how it functions, and replicate it in Plane Crazy basically?
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:30:57 Niiiice
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:33:03 The micro plane?
creations-chat 2019-06-09 00:36:08 Oh, I've seen that, it's a me jet isn't it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 06:31:15 Crash it, now
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 06:31:42 Look for the biggest ones and start sniping those, or just go berserk on the list, you're probably downloading a virus or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 06:32:08 That's the task manager <@!184819059404046336>
help 2019-06-10 03:13:57 <@232694074501496833> , it's a snow engine, a winter event exclusive item, it's not actually that powerful, it just looks fancy
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:18:02 <@456226577798135808> , Change your PFP, now
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:19:23 Don't ask ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 00:20:03 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:40:33 Shows you how smart people on Roblox are
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:01 A mechanism, not an object
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:08 Flying already done, boats are already done, trucks already done
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:49:46 I seriously doubt it to the point of saying it's laughable that you even thought it'd work, but show me
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:50:31 ..... Show it to us
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:26 .................
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:51:41 <@!567854080568066069> , I'm going to be honest, that's so bad it's actually insulting that you thought it'd go for inventor
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:53:40 More what to be exact?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:54:33 <@492398221432455168> , It's not exactly easy to make motors work when you need to make motors on motors on motors, on motors work with projects that are on average upwards of 5-6K blocks
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:29 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:42 <@!567854080568066069> , Cut the jokes about autism
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:55:58 It ain't fucking funny
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:56:57 Let me just run this through with you as an example: Is it okay to make holocaust jokes if you're Jewish?
Answer: Fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:07 Just because you are something, doesn't give you the right to insult it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:19 .... I just said fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:30 ............... <@!567854080568066069> __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 01:57:56 Right, QUIT BEING A SADISTIC ASSHOLE, nobody laughs at a joke like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:00:11 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:00:34 I can literally make a better one within the hour if I actually wanted to put the effort into doing so
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:02:22 Same pfp to ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:14:07 Get over it VietcongAmbush
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:14:52 ...... It's pathetic if anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:16:14 Right, your argument fell on it's face, because you don't even understand the basics of utilizing evidence
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:16:30 Viet, why are you still trying to cause problems here?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:17:23 ..... <@!567854080568066069> Viet, didn't I ban you for 2 NSFW things?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:17:46 And if you want to laugh at your truck, do so with a fucking straight jacket, we don't want to hear it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:18:25 <@!421848903361757184> , Not for long if he doesn't fucking shape up
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:18:54 Same PFP, same behavior (Or so Imperial [Who's rather decent at this] claims), and already trying to cause problems
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:20:06 <@!567854080568066069> VietcongAmbush, I'll "pretend" your current account and your banned account aren't related to eachother, but so help me, if you keep on trying to cause a shitstorm, I will not hesitate to seek and ban you, and every other alt that you put on here, until you absolutely quit it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 21:06:47 <@456226577798135808> , You mind not being rude next time?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 22:53:14 It's fine
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 22:53:31 Again, ping me all you want (Aside from ABSOLUTE spam), I'm fine with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:13:30 Meanwhile me, at the end of a round of Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:16:54 If they're up close, shotgun to the face, medium range, AK vs AK, long range, pistol, and if they're in cover, I either try to snapshot them with the sniper or suppress them
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:18:29 I can not get a headshot for the love of my life aside from an accident however, that's the one main flaw I have
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:00 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:28 I tend to park around mid and just run to the sides
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:19:58 Can we just agree that the knife is downright useless by the way?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:20:43 In Bad Business, it clears your kills when the round starts
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:22:49 At one point someone actually decided to go all out exploiter in BB, and the wireframe of everyone suddenly popped up, and everyone freaked out (This was back in like 1.3.4 or something though, can't remember)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:22:58 This was through walls by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:23:41 That's Roblox for ya
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:24:45 Trust me, you'll probably bump into one or two (Example: One guy took 12 DAMN PISTOL SHOTS and still refused to go down)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:25:52 I'd say former, there's signs that they're the latter if they're the latter, but it's probably the former, considering I have met alot of people that are very dubious (Shotgun sniper for example)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:26:03 (The kill feed even popped up as snipers, but we saw him using the shotgun)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:27:04 Definitely not, the wall was PAINTED with red pretty much (Aka alot of bullets just hit the wall)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:27:57 Saw an AR/pistol to (it killed people in 3 shots, but otherwise had an AR performance)
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:28:26 For reference, people have 150 health in BB, the AR does about 30 damage per shot, pistol does 50
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:31:05 I generally prefer the AK, although at a certain point, I transition over to the pistol, for what reason? I don't know, all I know is when I do so, suddenly I'm just a snapshot god for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:31:48 If my AK runs out, and I NEED to keep on firing, I generally prefer to swap to the shotgun
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:32:06 By that point people are so close to death that one or two grazing shots kills them
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:33:08 Generally uncomfortable with it, but otherwise I'd say don't take it too far, and no it's not true
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 23:33:16 You can CTRL+F it
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:02 <@!442848465857544193> , What the hell did you try to do exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:36 .......... I will ban you if you're trying to start shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 02:43:58 You don't need to show me, just, why are you trying to post that?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:12:14 Can I just mention I really despise snipers in Roblox games? They're literally just a giant sign going "Hey add aimbot to this game!"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:01 If you're wondering about the previous one I caught <@!249373398612967441> , it was a guy who was twitching around to all the positions of the players with a sniper, as soon as he found one that was out of cover, he snapped back and fired a single shot for a kill, then started snapping around again
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:21 Yeah, DON'T tell me that's not aimbotting
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:29 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:15:47 This game: https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-Prototype-1-5-0#!/game-instances
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:16:08 It's, currently going through a bit of a "phase" I guess with the snipers
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:17:46 Well either these people were downright dieties of sniping, or they're hacking, and considering they aimed at people through cover (Though thankfully they couldn't SHOOT through cover), yeaaaahhhhh, no, I don't think they're legitimate
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:19:58 I mean let me just bring up this again to show "I know what the fuck I'm doing"
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:20:53 Because I have reason to believe that there's a bot in your server YouMad
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:21:17 Meh, that might just be me in a bad/over-sensitive mood though, especially after the first one I found
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:21:47 Don't forget, they aren't stuck on/off with it you know, I've called someone out in that game before, and as soon as I did their aim dropped like an anvil
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:23:34 ..... Why are you always against every single fucking thing I do Empire, unless it has to do with banning someone who's done something horribly wrong?
What I mean is their aim went from pinpoint to crap all of a sudden
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:24:09 ... Really <@192861290677534722> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:24:50 ......... Guys, why?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:25:59 But seriously though back to what I was saying, I called someone out for aimbotting, and their aim was suddenly downright terrible afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:26:36 Nah, you're fine I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:28:02 But yeah, ever had a moment like that? Where some person was way too twitchy and precise to be legitimate?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:58:56 Nice job
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 20:59:21 If you joined literally yesterday though, loadouts wouldn't be a thing, and you could've used every weapon (Albeit a weaker shotgun) at any point in time
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:02:51 I know I'm guilty of using both the shotgun and AR in CQC fights, namely when one ran out I'd swap to the other
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:14:31 AR does 30 damage, semi-auto does 60, shotgun does who knows how much, sniper does 100, pistol does 50, knife does 75, silenced I think does 40, 45? Not sure, damage is X1.5 per headshot
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:17:14 Nah, I've sniped snipers with the pistol and AR, I think I'm actually talking about the max dropoff
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:17:26 Takes 5 shots to kill a sniper, 3 for the pistol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:17 They definitely deal 100 damage, even from one corner of the map to the other, probably someone exploiting, I've dealt more than 150 damage to people, and someone else comes up and mops them up, the kill thing says I dealt 150 damage though
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:32 Aka: I dealt 150 damage, but he had more than 150 health
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:19:40 Don't forget regen's a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:20:42 Yeah no definitely an exploiter then, I've seen people that don't die from a single sniper headshot, which IS an insta-kill
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:21:08 150 health, 100X1.5=150, they'd be dead as a can of spam if playing legitimately
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:34:46 I found a guy in Bad Business that took 1 shotgun burst, and more than 3 pistol shots to kill ... What is it with people hacking their health and thinking they're smart?
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:35:21 150 health vs 3X50 + however much damage the shotgun did
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:36:39 Meanwhile nobody captures the center point and whoever's trying to do a sniper squad looses
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 21:38:06 The only time I do that is when we've literally pushed them right to their spawn
the-dump 2019-06-12 22:05:58 <@456226577798135808> ...... Delete the one before that, now
help 2019-06-12 23:25:28 Do we even need to mention it? There's a fantastic thing called ballasts you know
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:10:22 <@!238825322508845056> , I'm already in another dungeon if you wanna follow along
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:13:26 There's tons of stuff here by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:13:33 Although chests aren't worthwhile
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:11 Not Dungeon Quest
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:13 Cube Cavern
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:14:36 This one https://www.roblox.com/games/2405063379/RELEASED-Super-Cube-Cavern-Beta
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:15:03 Alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 01:18:08 It's been so long since I played Armored Patrol, I'd honestly be too rusty at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 02:17:14 Well that was fun, sorry about the twin snipes Turismo
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 02:18:02 Especially that double shot in the end
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:53:27 -Cough cough-
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:53:53 Admittedly I have no idea what makes me tick, sometimes I'm a god of destruction, other times I'm about average
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:54:09 And I CAN NOT find out what the tie-in is
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:54:16 Bad Business, a new Rudimentality thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:06 What game is that Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:37 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:55:45 So basically it's a rocket tycoon sort of game?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 05:56:16 Because you've got a bigger rocket Empire, that's why
the-dump 2019-06-13 15:50:08 ...... <@224331596906364928> , that first one ...
the-dump 2019-06-13 15:52:17 "that first one" ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:52:34 I was away for a long while, don't judge the delayed response
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:55:33 My PFP's just a dragon, nothing more, nothing less
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:56:26 What snake has horns exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:20 The only result I got is this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerastes_cerastes
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:30 Also <@456226577798135808> , if you know you're toxic, then quit being toxic
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:57:46 ................
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:01 That's not an excuse
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:21 Wait till you see the shit I've had to deal with Nuclear
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:36 <@456226577798135808> , rule 10
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:58:56 It's really hard to moderate non-english languages, so could you please stick to english damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:21:34 ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:21:55 <@456226577798135808> , Are you seriously not even trying to read the rules at this point?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:34:55 Do I even need to say it? Are you honestly really that bad at basic processing of human norms?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:35:44 Fucking hell, just, fucking hell .....
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:36:26 <@!351809528209080324> , You aren't helping, and no <@456226577798135808> , it's not allowed, for reasons that SHOULD BE FUCKING OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WITH MORE BRAINCELLS THAN THE AVERAGE IQ
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:37:48 Oh so you get special permission Empire and yet I don't ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:37:58 For fuck's, <@!199178692847468545> , READ THE RULES god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:18 Just what's so important that you need to ping Rick for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:21 <@!199178692847468545>
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:38:57 .... <@!199178692847468545> , Exactly WHAT is so important, that you need to ping Rick for it, because spoilers: It's probably not that important
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:02 .......
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:27 Oh, well, uhhh, hmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:39:57 I'm assuming he didn't receive some items, so I suppose that is a legitimately a reason to ping Rick, since Rick or Madattak are the only 2 that can adjust that, and since Madattak's kinda strictly off limits unless it's absolutely completely vitally important
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:40:27 Alright fair you can pass, but don't ping him unless it's important, AND it's something only he can do, such as giving exclusive items
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:50:58 Done
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:33:34 Jesus, that thing just goes berserk
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:33:51 Contain it in a magnet field or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:35:18 Well add more anchored restraints on it, see how it treats that
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 22:35:52 It's like an angry dog or something, just goes mental
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 23:46:07 I play it, I've got an RPK
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 00:04:18 SCRAM drive? Basically a hyperdrive, but much stronger and random?
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:00:46 ..... <@!191446848999915520> , The tail, body and nose are all the same based on the screenshots I have access to, the only thing that's different is that yours is very badly co-axial
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:06:08 Because there is an extremely high probability that the primary body of the craft is simply being copied from the original owner <@!302698900521877504>
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:17:24 Not so much NSFW Empire so much as controversial, and generally just rude
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:17:35 But yeah it does deserve a warn
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:23:33 It's fine
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:23:38 At least as far as I can see
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:33:44 ........... I'd say delete it
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:33:52 Just to be safe
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:43:17 .... <@!382347931019378691> , I don't give a damn about either side, but I'd suggest you take that fucking statement back, because to be honest, that was rude as hell
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:35 Then keep your opinion to yourself
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:50 Nobody cares who likes what, so long as they keep them to themselves
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:44:55 .... **AHEM**
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:27 Fucking hell keyboard
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:47 The thing underneath it's starting to shift to the left or something
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:45:49 Just, don't push it guys
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:47:55 ..... God fucking, I keep on telling Voxel to update that
the-dump 2019-06-14 02:48:33 Sod it, it's the dump after all, anything NSFW I will snipe down though, and I don't care if I hit the person who posted it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 02:58:16 Even numbered width isn't THAT bad, you just need to know how to work with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 02:59:05 I could probably make an even numbered fighter if I wanted to, but 
1: I have no inspiration (Don't push it, I get inspiration on my own)
2: I have no drive to do so
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:59:49 They're exceptionally similar, I doubt the nose was the only thing you copied
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 03:00:21 If you have to read a tutorial, you won't learn anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 03:02:01 I only do the very first steps of tutorials, mostly to get my self situated on the handling, and to learn any interesting mechanics
creations-chat 2019-06-14 03:02:22 Meh, get permission from him and you'll be free to copy, but otherwise it's too similar
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:14 You actually got the flamethrower in-game?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:25 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:47:29 What's the ammo count like?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:48:10 Sounds like something I'd want, I'm currently on RPK/Tec-9 (Tec's actually pretty damn amazing in-game if you know how to tap-fire it properly), and the RPK's punchy, but the reload sucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:02 Fire treated wood?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:18 Imperial, ram first, doesn't matter how badly you'd want Minecraft to run if you don't have the space for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:47 Fire treating's a legitimate thing, dunno how it works, but it makes the object, which is normally quite flammable (Such as wood or curtains), pretty heat resistant, at least compared to their non-treated counterparts
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:50:55 Or is it heat treating? Dunno
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 06:54:12 Depends
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:48:17 Settings and/or drive the damn thing there
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:48:41 ..... Can I help you <@!438097723598569472> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:50:37 Balance out flotation with helium and ballasts, then use very minor amounts of engines to tweak it the final way
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:09:55 Bloody hell it's super stubby
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:23:29 .... <@!418943249588420618> , Change it
creations-chat 2019-06-14 23:52:25 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:52:45 I banned the guy for 10 minutes so he/she could change their PFP
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:52:57 Basically
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 23:53:05 Suggestive as hell at least
creations-chat 2019-06-15 20:30:56 Is it ACTUALLY faster is the big question
creations-chat 2019-06-15 20:31:25 Put 2 flipper style motors side-by-side, one uncapped, one at the cap, if the uncapped one lobs it's self further, then it works
the-dump 2019-06-15 20:40:55 .....
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 00:03:23 ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:41:54 Uhhhhh, can that, even fly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:45:41 I'd imagine the lift is far too far in the back to actually fly, considering I tried introducing a friend to this, and even with the center of lift barely in the back, he pitched downwards too hard to lift up
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 02:58:40 Looks like game night's starting up again, at least an improptu one
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 05:27:35 I'm indifferent to this, and aren't bothered by your rejoining, but I can't say the same for the other mods/admins
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:42:19 .... Wait there was a double
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:42:25 ?clearwarn <@!589657946082770984>
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:43:13 Don't act dumb
help 2019-06-16 18:43:30 Force it to day, use the settings
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:05 Furious, can I **HELP** you!? I'm not having a good day
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:09 ........
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:44:26 <@!589657946082770984> , really?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:45:42 .......... Let me just mention, quit acting like a fucking asshole, I'm not in a good mood today, and I will throw out warns with a damn hair trigger if you fuck up today
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:14 What even is in his PFP?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:41 ..... What I see is a giant box of "parental advisory" or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:54 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:47:56 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:48:43 Like I said, god damn hair trigger ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:48:58 And you'll follow them to Furious if you don't drop it
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:49:18 Empire, I'm the kind of person that actually gets people reformed
help 2019-06-16 18:50:42 Like abnormal downwards pitch, even for having lift so far in the back?
help 2019-06-16 18:51:04 Were you able to pull up before at about 600+ speed?
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:51:34 9.1's run by Wingman8, 9.5's supposedly run by a guy who helped 9.0 and 9.1
help 2019-06-16 18:52:05 Your center of lift is why, the further back it is, the more of an effect it has, and the faster you're going, the more lift it creates
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:52:33 Honestly I don't give a fuck about the version as long as it runs good
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:54:42 It's definitely too small for planes to be honest, aside from airstrikes or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:55:16 Biplanes were actually used during WWII, infact they were used to sink the Bismark
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:56:04 Whatever Imperial, you get the point, also Empire, not every single damn person knows
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 18:56:32 ..... Empire I am not in the mood for these damn antics, so can you NOT
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:37:10 Playing the game Madattak was on, have to micromanage it to fuck (Paused it so I could actually take the screencap), but I got this
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:38:01 The tiiiiny fluctuations in the AC generator and turbine are enough to drag them into warning territory (Which is bad), but tweaking them slightly fixes it
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:45:24 Do I win? My score literally isn't going any higher, even when I try to bump it past the safety thresholds temporarily
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:46:09 The one Madattak was playing
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 19:46:15 Check <#537387562126278656>
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:18 Uhhhh, quickly, bit of a surprise came around, anyone know how to take care of budgie eggs?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:27 __***LOOK!***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 00:58:57 I'm googling as hard as I can, and yes there's a male
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 01:03:24 Considering the girl budgie trusts me alot (To the point where I can hold her and she literally won't mind), I feel like biting's not going to be an issue if I do wind up having to throw it out
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 01:11:41 That is fucking morbid as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 05:17:21 Was that a tiny gecko thing Spy?
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:17:25 .... Uhhhh, <@418361319440384001> , What the fuck?
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:17:36 How is that funny exactly, and not simply offensive?
the-dump 2019-06-17 06:18:30 Ehhhhh, fine morbid
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:00:59 Please tell me you're kidding me <@!386974424538152960> , or that it's ACTUALLY that and not a joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:02:07 FFS, I'm going to assume best case scenario and say it actually was that number, carry on
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 07:02:51 Fucking sleep then battleship! Get as much as you can, now goodnight
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:14:45 What, in Those Who Remain?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:15:36 TEC-9's pretty damn good, so far the only replacement candidate is the CBJ gun thing, and that one has slightly less damage for more firerate and more ammo (Presumably it's full auto)
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:15:57 Everything else I know I'd run outa ammo WAY too fast for it to be useful, they really need to make the amount of spare mags known
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:16:20 Like, mag size in Those Who Remain's not a problem for me, it's how much SPARE ammo there is
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:04 Reach for the M1 Garand, it's a godsend, be sure to reload early to avoid having to draw the bolt (Except for the Garand, in which case it's faster to empty the mag), and always keep an eye on ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:05 PVE
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:14 Wave based zombie survival that is actually pretty difficult in the end
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:18 Yeah, only PVE
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:17:52 Grablador, I'd also suggest the TEC-9, think Grease Gun, but semi-auto, and with alot more ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:18:35 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:19:28 Isn't that a snippit of a quick video?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:19:56 It is, https://twitter.com/birbb/status/1117943947400228865
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:20:42 Hey, I have a potential baby bird coming very soon so what do you expect!?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:21:36 To be honest, if you're firing anything at full auto, either you've fucked up and got cornered, or are wasting ammo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:22:23 Also can we just agree that melee is worthless aside from a joke?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:23:10 I only use it on the first few waves as a joke to play whack-a-mole with as many zombie heads as possible
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:24:03 Not even then, too risky due to run speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:25:16 Round 15 now (Discluding the bursters, because fuck those things) is actually easier than the old round 10, back when it ended at round 10
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:25:34 Because you can keep on-pace with the zombies, with the old round 10, they were slightly faster than you
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:01 They leave a cloud of spores or something, so basically acid
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:11 Bypasses armor to

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:26:43 Don't you ask that on a freaking daily basis?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:07 Get a rank from <#544022464133595166> , novice won't count because it's too easy to get them, and do "&suggest (Suggestion)" in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:44 33, 34, somewhere around there last I checked
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:27:57 I got the RPK recently, and hooohhhh boy the reload time's a doozy
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:28:33 I'd actually stay on the AK-47 just purely because of the reload time (Also the optics are annoying), but it doesn't have enough ammo, nor deal enough damage
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:29:19 I tend to be the last one surviving, even when there was a level 87 in the server, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:30:22 Actually, post a full uncropped picture of both your creation and the block count, then state the rank you want
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:30:46 And post a picture of it doing whatever you want if it's something like carrier commando or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:32:03 <@!518187868347170818> , Done, please no bad suggestions, think of how it'd work and everything about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:32:24 And DON'T leak the VIP server link, every time that happened, shortly afterwards we've had an influx of trolls try to ruin it for everyone
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:35:06 I went double barrel, grease gun, M1 Garand, AK-47, RPK for primaries
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:35:36 Pretty sure there's something else there, though I can't remember what I picked
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:37:55 Depends, are you able to make a proper stand yourself?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:44:31 Let me check Kip
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:45:49 I'd personally suggest the Sten MK5
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:46:23 Then KAC PDW, then M1 Garand
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:46:53 For secondary, either get the Serbu if you REALLY need a useful secondary right now, or go for the TEC-9
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 19:49:10 Just get as many kills as possible during those waves, and maybe stay with high levels
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:32:09 As I've happily found out using the revolver, there are still people that grossly hack their health to absurd values (4 damage markers, 1 was a headshot, no kill, the revolver's basicaly the old M1911, except with a much smaller mag size)
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:33:10 Since I don't know, but one thing's for certain, 150 health ain't getting you past 225 damage, and I keep on seeing people survive upwards of 300 damage, only to return fire
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:33:43 If they were lagging they wouldn't have a 20 KDR, and they'd drop dead about 4-5 seconds later
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:34:27 By the way, shotgun snipers are back ... our entire team was literally dropped in one burst by a shotgun, 7-8 people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:34:58 Like 1200 health, noped out by a single shotgun burst, like what the fuck? That doesn't happen
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:36:31 While it's hard to do so, I am really sick of the hacks in-game, especially since some people are twitchier than pure fentanyl users
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:36:59 Hell, the most hilarious one was some guy shooting backwards, moonwalking
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:37:08 Because people abuse votekicks all the time
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:37:53 Also, twitchiness signifies aimbot, especially if they use pinpoint weapons at point blank, and fentanyl's a drug that can be snuck into regular drugs to make them far more addictive, and far more deadly, and since withdrawl commonly has shaking, take a guess what I'm talking about there
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:38:54 Like seriously, there's unobserved quantum matter that's less twitchy than the idiots who think a snap aimbot's not a dead giveaway
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:39:51 Even with these hackers though I tend to get about a 6-7KDR (The new Vector does about 20 damage per shot, not FUCKING 50)
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:40:23 I expect people with 150 health to die in 3 shots of a 50 damage pistol
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:40:38 Not to survive another headshot afterwards and snipe my face
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:12 The semi-auto rifle?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:46 I like it, it's decent, but it's kinda just a slightly better version of the revolver
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:41:56 Magnum, whatever it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:07 As is the revolver
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:34 To be honest few people use the AK these days, I'm guessing because it's the uncomfortable middleman that nobody ever uses
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:55 Not fast enough to out-dps a CQC brawl, not powerful enough to kill a sniper
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:42:58 It's RoF got nerfed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:04 And it got nerfed PRETTY hard
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:20 Like, the silenced pistol's faster now
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:43:29 Or, on par I think, I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:07 To be honest, I just want an LMG
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:27 Not really
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:44:47 If you have EVER seen me  at LMG point defense, I'm just a god damn brick wall to face
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:45:04 Exceeeept when flanked or sniped
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:45:25 Nah, stationary MGs are too easy to camp
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:46:01 But yeah, give me cover, a decently accurate full auto gun, or keep them off of me, and I just tear people to pieces
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:46:29 Ahem -cough-, as shown by here, back when it was KOTH
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:47:08 ................. <@!249373398612967441> , Check again
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:47:38 Plus smaller servers means smaller teams, and funnily enough I do worse in smaller servers than in bigger servers, even though there's more people shooting at me, probably because there's more people for them TO shoot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:29 I still remember when I called someone out for aimbotting, and their aim dropped like a god damn rock
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:54 From a 13 KDR down to a .8 KDR before the game ended
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:49:55 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:51:40 You get about a 3 second I-frames when you spawn, which HASN'T screwed me over yet, it nearly did though
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:18 Actually, 51 kills, 0 deaths
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:23 AK was nerfed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:36 Nah, melee's fine where it is to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:44 Bad Business
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:47 https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-Prototype-1-7-0
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:53:54 It's the whole thing about range
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:54:27 There's a reason we use guns instead of knives in a war
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:55:22 It's exploiter hell currently, I'm seeing people with upwards of 600 FUCKING HEALTH
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:56:11 <@!249373398612967441> , try saying that when YOU find a fun game and consistently you keep on finding people hacking it to hell and back
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:57:03 How do you beat someone when they literally have 4X as much health compared to you, and the same exact weaponry?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 00:58:33 Alright, what about someone with an aimbot? I've seen people spinning around like fucking heli rotors  wielding a sniper, just nailing headshot after headshot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:02:58 I remember in one D-day game, I actually brought an LMG, dug into the cliffside, and literally, even before people started landing, I started just completely leveling them with the LMG, and all they could do was either run towards the oncoming death, or take potshots at me, which never really hit
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:03:39 Not quite spray moreso as a CWIS style of attack
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:04:00 As soon as I saw movement, I aimed as close as I could get at them, THEN sprayed
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:04:47 I can't remember it, I do know that you could use resource points to build stuff down, such as spotlights and mortars
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:05:55 Well try taking me out with an M1 and you'll find a wall of bullets heading your general direction
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:06:44 I mean, there's a difference between spraying needlessly and actually spraying with aim
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:07:19 .... Can I help you <@!249373398612967441> ?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:25:35 .............
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:26:10 Oh whatever
creations-chat 2019-06-19 01:26:18 The point's the same anyways
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:27:49 I mean, in a way he's not wrong
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:28:12 But it's moreso grandparent, I adopted the parakeet and it's probably gonna have baby parakeets
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 01:28:48 Don't ask Anti
help 2019-06-19 02:44:22 These aren't our builds, we're reporting people that make these builds
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:43:59 .... Who are you <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:45:14 Raptor, show which one and proof of it, or name the creation and I'll CTRL+F and look for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:45:34 And <@456226577798135808> , as long as you follow the rules, I don't care who you are or what you do
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:49:02 Okay, <@456226577798135808> , can you NOT, seriously, it's annoying
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:06 .......... <@456226577798135808> , Shut, the fuck, up, you can't use anything as an excuse, now cut the crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:30 If you're here to troll people, I'm here to break your face with a club, disabled or not, you don't get to hurt people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:50:59 By "Hurt people", I don't mean physically, I mean like bothering thei- ......
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:51:08 Anti, tell him to drag it back to here, now
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:51:53 Riiight, <@456226577798135808> , cut it out, nobody likes a troll, and nobody likes an annoyance
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:15 Okay okay okay cut the joking stuff guys
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:35 "Yo" you're not going to be back for long if you don't cut the damn crap
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:52:50 I don't care what state you're in, don't bother other people
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:53:27 Just, if you're here to troll people, get out, otherwise clean up your damn act
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:00 Nobody will willingly help you so long as you act like a complete incompetent idiot
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:18 Now shape up and actually act like a decent human being who knows at least the basics of human social norms
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:27 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:49 He probably squeaked it by right as he got muted
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:54:57 Anyways, Imperial, that won't work, he'll just flock to DMs ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 03:56:04 Permission granted, request a duration
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:00:35 Please make sure it follows rule 2, we've had an argument spark up about something that was seemingly innocent before
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:02:57 .... <@!257624380291547146> , You know there's this fantastic thing called <#495286269459300364> , where stuff like this belongs, right?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:17 Small planes are actually surprisingly easy and unsurprisingly very low effort to make
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:11 They're supposed to be on the back of the wings normally, not on the front
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:10 .... <@!210141202698338304> , The faster you go, the stronger they get, not to mention mouse controlled is really weak in the first place, and optimized control surfaces actually have a hell of alot of kick
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:21 Also seriously, how?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:36 Look at this, almost 2K parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:09 Yet it flies like this, like 350ish parts
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:39 I mean okay fine true but still <@!210141202698338304>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:02 Also I built the thing purely for performance Laurence
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:20 Point is you can build something massive, and have it maneuver like a tiny thing, if you design it well
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:11 Probably because it's designed very badly? Legitimately there's no other reason it shouldn't work
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:59 "tbf", have you seen anyone even come close to doing any better with a modular aerodynamic system?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:16 Introgue, how does that thing fly? The center of lift is SO far back
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:10 Have you TRIED anything else?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:34 It's fine Introgue
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:40 Not really
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:03 Uhhhh, scratch out "look nice" ...
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:24 I mean, if you design it with care, sure, but still
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:29 .... Excuse me?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:48 Are you really trying to challenge me to make a good looking small craft?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:08:00 Also they are rather nice Introgue
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:51 Alright then, challenge accepted
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:10:43 Then don't complain when a poorly built small thing doesn't work, they're finickey little suckers
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:03 Then learn how to make magnet drives or use the actual propeller blades
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:28 Super rockets were there purely because people kept on complaining that rockets weren't strong enough, which stemmed from people complaining that jet engines weren't strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:26 "Super jet", are you sure you know what you're talking about?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:55 How is it vague? It's a supersized jet engine
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:03 Plus if you're using that, you're using something massively inferior
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:31 Double plus we've already addressed that super rockets are basically just stronger regular rockets, so presumably a "super jet" would be a stronger regular jet, not a huge jet engine
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:22 Laurence, functionality and fashion don't go together in Plane Crazy, very few people are able to use both of them
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:38 Now afk for driving stuff
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:20 And FYI, magnet drives are rather large engines that are entirely silent, extremely reliable, and propel you forward faster than a super rocket is ever capable of doing, even when it's unburdened
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:19 Laurence, speaking of age, how old are you?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:00 I have the right to ask when I think someone's underage, due to Terms of Service limiting the minimal age, and considering your behavior and lack of understanding of everything (And no I'm not driving YET)
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:05 Also it's fine Deciduss, it looks nice
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:50 I might be older, I might be younger, who knows
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:58 And no it doesn't
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:27 I can ask people for their age if I think they're underage on the server, since it's required that we ban people that are underage
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:48 ......... Just, what kind of logic is that exactly?
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:51 I'm out anyways, <@456226577798135808> , mind taking over for these two idiots? And yeah, just post a picture just like killin did
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:57 It's good enough for this
creations-chat 2019-06-20 00:29:41 It's, "unique", I guess? Maybe?
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:43:50 <@!217338313357393920> , late reply, but unless you're everyone, that's completely false
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:32:51 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:32:59 I have no idea how to get the super book aside from the shop then
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:33:05 (Super Cube Cavern for those wondering)
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:33:19 Same with the shields, all 3 of them, regular (Don't know it's name), soul and demon
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:35:44 Well designed crafts can still fly even with critical damage
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:35:57 Ahem -coughcough-
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:36:33 I mean, I can literally cut it in half, flex-tape style, and it'll still fly, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:36:55 Middle
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:37:04 I wonder if I could actually RC fly both halves
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:37:19 The only explanation I have is that I've designed it very well
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:39:24 Zero gravity?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:39:45 Ah, it's the gravity rod, stick + super magic
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:05 It lets you shift your direction of gravity 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:10 Problem is fall damage is a thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:40:13 So be careful using it
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:41:05 Super Cube Cavern, basically a reboot of the original Cube Cavern by the original developer, zKevin
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:43:55 Extra plot sizes is a really bad idea, for multiple reasons, even assuming it wasn't hard-coded
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:44:52 Let me put it this way, this thing at about 1.7K parts already lags the shit out of my computer at graphics 1, and this doesn't even fill up the entire plot
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:45:22 Not to mention people even now are running into the upper limits of parts, so you'd need to add more parts, which would allow people to make more lag, etc etc etc
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:08 This is sorta why we blocked off <#507673335816126509> , because people kept on going "Increase plot size!" after we literally just responded why that was a bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:16 RIP Turismo, did you at least take pictures of it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:34 RIPX2, well, designing it's the hardest part at least, building it's a bit easier
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:46:51 Autosave occupies spots, and is generally only useful to those that have a common tendency to forget, or bad connections
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:07 **GENERALLY**
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:18 It happens with all high speed crafts Imperial, I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:47:24 When it starts lagging, they start wobbling
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:48:04 For the Wyvern fighters of mine, it's a massive up/down wobble that can be counteracted by decreasing speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 00:52:55 Imperial, modernize it
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:32:34 .......... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:33:17 Voxel, you take care of this, I know I'm oversensitive today
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:33:59 Okay, what degree do you have exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:34:30 You Googled it ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:34:42 Took too long to respond
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:35:20 Look, if you REALLY are training to be a fighter pilot, good for you, now shouldn't you be practicing or something?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:38:10 Meh, let them be Katze, I smell BS, but there's no concrete way to disprove it, just don't go flaunting it around like you won the lottery or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:38:38 You're a pilot, "wow", just don't try to boast or brag about it please
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:39:22 Good for you, still a good idea to read up some more beforehand though
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:39:40 What the f-, <@!313930200939233281> , how?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:40:11 .......... How is it spam SevenSpikes?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:40:18 It's just alot of stuff going on
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:01 Yeah no they definitely won't let you, unless it's a passenger thing, even then
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:25 F-18s are military grade jets for fuck's sake
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:42:44 ....... <@263770097288609794> , That's what I should be saying to you
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:43:17 I mean, Kayn, trains are pretty easy to control, plus they're mostly automated, double plus they're likely being supervised
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:45:02 Sean, they are, it's just that I smell alot of BS, especially since <@263770097288609794> literally said this
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 21:45:42 Well, happy birthday or whatever Seven
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:52:46 Motor engines count to you know
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:53:36 Magnet drive still doesn't count
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:53:48 ONLY a single rocket engine as it's propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:57:09 Presumably it's more parts
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:16 Want me to be blunt?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:28 PFFFF **HAHAHAAAHHHH**, you aren't getting inventor for that, fuck no
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:58:50 It's awful, threadbare, and to be honest it reminds me of one of those damn tinfoil scrap tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:12 Depends on the magnet mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:24 99.9% of the time, "No"
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 01:59:58 Also the super book Danny, and it cuts walkspeed by a half
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:03 And no battleship, magnet drives are likely done with by now
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:17 Unless you can SOMEHOW make a magnet drive that occupies the same amount of space a beam does or something, and even then
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:00:34 Well nevermind, freaking hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:01:39 Other way around, not 200 or less
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:16:46 It's a new mechanism, something that pretty much any creation can use
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:16:52 Why DO you think it's so impossible?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:18:22 Just wait for something new to pop up
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:19:18 So wait, are we talking about it can reload at any orientation, loads from the inside of the battleship, and lobs a shell of sizable proportions, AND doesn't occupy the entire plot?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:45:50 I've actually maxed out on it, the guy's actually a pretty bad scumbag
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:46:46 If you ever notice why there's 2 Infection Incs, apparently the second one's made by the original creator, while the first one was stolen by the UndoneBuilder guy, or so I saw on a sorta twitter war
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 02:47:01 <#504436696021204992> , it'll automatically get ported over to <#384025409945337856>
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:32:47 You're already verified
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:38:08 ?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:38:11 What do you mean?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:39:56 You need a rank from <#544022464133595166> , due to the fact that we've had people ruin the specific VIP servers in the past, namely unranked people, and yes, it was just THAT much of a pattern
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:40:00 What news server?
bot-central 2019-06-22 06:40:43 Literally everyone can see announcements ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:51:50 Didn't we ban you or something?
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:52:00 Other guy
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:52:19 Oh, OOOHHHHH, I remember you, nevermind!
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 20:58:42 Limitations I suppose
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 21:06:57 Alright, VIP 1
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 21:07:19 Er, VIP 2 then
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:23 !servers
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:32 ......
bot-central 2019-06-22 21:07:38 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:16:06 You need a rank to access the VIP servers, this is because most of the people that tried to ruin our servers were unranked
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:16:45 It's not bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 01:32:26 Probably in a bit
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:00:33 ?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:13 I think so? Depends how far they're taking it
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:43 They aren't in the server I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:01:56 Uhhhh, you know who's?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:02:16 Yeup, seems like it, <@!557172100545249281> __***AHEM***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:02:46 .......... <@!557172100545249281>
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:04:00 Look at the screenshots Voxel, this is in VIP 1 by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:04:59 I'm not warning them twice, just one of them
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:20 ..... Veloci, come on, really?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:28 You do realize you'll loose more ranks if you leave, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:49 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:05:57 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:06:33 Ehhhh, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for that one, but just let people like what they like
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:07:07 The last couple of people that made "anti-furry" jokes that I've seen tried to cause a f- you're kidding me ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:07:40 Fuuuuuck's sake, okay but seriously, the last couple of people that I've seen that made "anti-furry" jokes wound up actually trying to harass some of the members
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:08:07 Ehhhhh, it's a highly recurring pattern though, so sorta just incase
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:09:43 Meh, I try to be nice, but recently I've just been having a shitty streak
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:13:18 .... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:21:11 Seriously? ... Right, <@!557172100545249281> , are you leaking the VIP 1 link, if not, then who the hell did? Because Logavix isn't ranked, and you need to be ranked to get in
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:21:57 Voxel, I can't tell if that's a complement or an insult, either way are you just going to let that be a norm?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:23:07 Juuust take care of this, whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:26:41 Logavix, the thing is, people leaked before, and when people leaked, it went massively out of control of even the original person who leaked, which wound up bringing trolls over to the VIP servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:26:53 He's banned Imperial, you can tell because you can't see his ranks
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:32:16 Look, the problem happened like almost, if not a year ago, someone shared the link, then it spread further through that person, over and over again, until we literally couldn't user the VIP servers anymore because someone kept on building a lag bomb creation
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:32:35 We need to keep it secure
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:33:20 Yeah it's only a week
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:34:31 I'm always available for pinging
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:39:48 I'm just gonna back out of this, you guys deal with this
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:40:40 Logavix, you need to have something that actually applies to the rank, not novice either, those tend to be too easy to get
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:41:22 Clutter I guess? Ask Voxel
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:42:46 Dude, Logavix, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:43:12 We're looking for stuff like these
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:43:31 Read <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:44:43 *Yes for novice, you need to build a 5K+ part plane* **OF COURSE NOT**, ahem, but seriously though, don't make just a flying box, try to put effort into details
plane-crazy 2019-06-23 05:57:13 Might need to reload the save, or refresh it, it's a bug that Rick's trying to fix
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:21:35 Astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:22:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:22:51 I personally don't like it, namely because performance is heavily tied to design, so if you want an awesome looking craft as well as a high performance craft, can't happen
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:23:08 At least back in the original game
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:30:24 The tools are more complicated, but it's more or less just Plane Crazy without gravity or aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:43:42 I'm slightly tempted to go at it and see what I can make, but I know I don't have the time nor patience for Astrocraft, especially after the bad taste the first game gave me
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:52:12 Back in the old game, I managed to glitch like 30 supersized reactors into one tiny space, but the problem was, even if I outfitted it with the largest weapons possible, people kept on building these giant meta builds for combat, or noob cubes
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:52:36 Meanwhile fighters got the shortest end of the stick possible and were completely useless
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 01:53:35 I mean, it's better, just because Galaxy is Galaxy, and anything's better than Galaxy, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:00:37 Wait, question, are there actual weapons in-game yet?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:00:52 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:03:57 Okay, now I'm tempted to start making stuff on there
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 02:06:39 We said it like 3 times, Astrocraft
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:19:38 ..... Really?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:25:02 No, you aren't getting inventor for that, be lucky you're still on the damn server infact
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:25:33 Cut it the fuck out guys ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:22 .... Really <@456226577798135808> ?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:23 Wait ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:28 <@!518272525684310016>
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:44 Explain, now
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:46:59 ?modlogs <@!518272525684310016>
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:47:32 <@456226577798135808> __***AHEM***__, I see your second account on here
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:49:01 Answer, now ...
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:52:37 You do realize I won't leave your main on here, right?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:52:47 And you could be potentially banned from Plane Crazy as a whole as well
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:53:07 Then don't throw shit around on an alt, thinking you're clever
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:53:32 Then what's with the alt?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:54:20 .......... There's a difference between maturity and just downright being bad
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:55:11 Just, I feel like being in a nice mood now, you can stay on here, but get the hell on your main, and drag your alt out of this server, unless you'd like to transfer over to the alt, in which case get the main out, and stay on your alt
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 03:55:55 __***GUYS***__
creations-chat 2019-06-24 03:56:18 I'm not doing it, you have full power to force your alt out of the server, so do so
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 03:56:33 Not quite angered so much as just, FREAKING HELL
creations-chat 2019-06-24 05:08:14 I already dealt with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 19:24:14 King, gonna remove your old account if you don't mind
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:28 Anyone remembered the Expanse testing I did that one day? Expanse Skirmisher?
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:41 We're running another test session, hopefully one more stable this time
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:22:53 I know I invited some people over last time
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 03:23:15 Meh, well game's on my favorites, so join if you want
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:48:26 <@227960066626551810> , Right, let's get this out of the way, we legally can not allow people under 13 years old, or that we have suspicion of being under 13 years old, on our server, without major problems arising, we have multiple reasons to believe, and that show evidence of your friend being under 13 years old, so we need to enforce that, if you have issues with this, contact Discord, not us, because we can't go against it without the entire server potentially being shut down
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:49:11 If you can get a special pass for our server to allow people under 13 years old, great, we'll start doing so, but until we have definitive proof that they'll do so, we can't risk it
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:50:15 It said <13, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:50:51 He's trying to ask on part of his friend
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:51:35 The only reliable non-invasive way we have of gauging age is the age inputted on the Roblox account
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:52:50 So unless you'd like to send your birth certificate or something (Please don't, really, please don't, there's a miasma of legal and seecurity issues that can arise from that), we can't gauge your age any other way, apologies for that
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:57:26 <@227960066626551810> , Right, after reviewing his behavior, how you handled the situation and since your story is plausible enough, we're unbanning him, but be **SURE** he isn't actually <13, like I said, if he is, there could be legal issues
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:58:16 Got it, we're trusting your word on this
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 17:58:52 Not a problem, we just need to be a bit sensitive about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:23:47 While nitro boosting is appreciated, it doesn't elevate you above the rules
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 02:24:45 I mean think of how unfair it'd be if someone could just pay their way to do whatever they wanted in the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:10:14 https://www.roblox.com/games/679715583/Starscape-Pre-Beta#!/about Should I?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:10:22 I'm a fan of all things space, but should I?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:05:03 I'm only checking in to see what's going on ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:14:27 !!! __***FUCKING HOLD IT***__
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:14:56 I have a note on him ...
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:15:28 I usually make notes on people that have been banned before, basically on what they've done
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:16:20 People tend to repeat the same thing turbo
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:16:43 Mmmmmm, give him the benefit of the doubt though this time
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:17:01 No notes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:17:39 Nah, I'd probably be open about that instead of just a note
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:19:39 ..... Ah, now I remember him
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 14:20:44 <@456226577798135808> If I come back and hear there were problems I swear to god I'm going to beat you into the ground until you're sitting in a crater, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:06 What the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:27 Yeaaahhhh, no, that lost me right there, I was going to get into Astrocraft, but then I saw that
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:22:44 Just, no, the level of detail on that is actually hurting my eyes a bit, jesus fucking christ, ow
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:23:25 Nah, I'm fine, my creativity's sorta gone at this point
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:25:34 That ship on the right though, those engines look so nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:27:33 It was like that in the old Space Construction game to, just these massive "oh my fucking god what is that level of detail" mega ships
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:28:10 "Energy melee" Cue gundams with space axes
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:28:17 I'd imagine that's to get it maneuvering
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:29:56 I really don't have the time for Astro Craft
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:31:49 Okay now I just feel like shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:32:34 Madattak+AS devs when?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:33:08 If he doesn't have a mutual sever with you, you can't send a message to him
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:33:16 If he does have a mutual server with you, then RIP that
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:03:52 Since a person who boosted the server got banned, I decided to make an announcement on it, just incase anyone else thinks similarly, feel free to read it
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:05 Yes, and yes Orangeskii?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:25 And I did check, he was the latest one (At least based on server updates) who boosted the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:05:34 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:07:24 I don't have a rolecard for you, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:08:14 If you recall any roles, or have a rolecard of your own, feel free to put it here and I'll fill em out again
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 01:10:38 Linh, you do realize that modeler's a pretty high one, right? I can't go on gut instinct, even though I THINK you were on modeler
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:49:09 I mean, it is based off of the Wyvern, which you know how combat capable it is, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:49:43 Funnily enough it's definitely showing it's age, although I'm not really that motivated to use the Plane Crazy engine to build a new craft
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:27 The game, whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:38 I will say though
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:50:42 I won't say anything else
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 03:52:14 Wrong, smaller or harder to hit targets, especially if you can vary the spread
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:12:00 You build big, then decrease size, that's how you cram tons of details in
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:17:55 Is that your tank?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:18:09 Niiice
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 04:19:01 Starfighter, go for it
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:43:54 Already covered it purified
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:44:04 Also, Miner, I'm going to pretend you didn't make that joke, if you erase it
help 2019-06-29 17:12:50 I mean, build copying is PRETTY bad and demoralizing, I'd say it's somewhat valid, if a bit petty
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:27 Oh hey, what's this?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:29 Also what the fuck Danny?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:32:39 (Not in a mad way FYI)
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:04 I saw that before you deleted it, daaahhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:31 **DAAAHHHHH X2**, okay but seriously though it is kinda funny
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:33:50 Anyways, thoughts on the little spoiler on the thing I'm building?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 19:32:43 Made a brief announcement about stuff going on recently
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 19:32:55 Hi
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:49:41 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:50:36 Yeup, in studio
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:51:20 In other news, the thing I'm making is entering it's final stages, all that's left is to color it and add minor details
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 20:56:43 I somewhat enjoy how most of us are using text, just listening to the nice background music that hidear's playing
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:09:31 I need color ideas
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:10:48 Protagonist starfighter
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:44:59 Makes me think of something from Galaxy, I hate that game, but that ship looks really nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:46:02 <@!454809803223465984> , welcome back to the server, nice that you're of-age now
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:46:08 Well, of-age to be in the server
help 2019-06-29 22:25:45 Center of lift is too far back, bring wings forward
help 2019-06-29 22:26:01 It's smashing your nose into the ground by lifting up the rear of your plane
help 2019-06-29 22:39:05 Engine might be above the center of mass?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:13:51 Sooooo, I finalized this
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:00 Thoughts?
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:20 
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 23:14:28 
help 2019-06-30 03:55:53 I don't think that's the issue, save it, then reload it, either that or rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:30:58 Can someone notify 7Spikes that they're going to be banned for a long while because they left to avoid the warn
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:31:44 Still gonna just mash him with a hammer honestly
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:33:35 Legendary, try making the fighter I posted?

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:34:19 You have full permission to call the recreation yours if you manage to make it by the way, well, as long as you acknowledge the source material

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:36:32 Many of those circular things are turret mounts by the way
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:36:50 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:37:10 This is what one looks like in the actual game it's in, with turrets https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/3/30/Onslaught_loadout1.png/revision/latest?cb=20180925122646
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:39:51 How about a Starsector Atlas instead? Similar size by the way https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfarergame/images/c/c0/Atlas_af.png/revision/latest?cb=20170426204456

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 05:44:21 If you want an idea on how large the ships are, turret mounts stay relatively the same size

the-dump 2019-07-01 00:34:31 Dude, come on
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:08 Ahem ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:26 Crank it back before I have to start whack-a-moleing people
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 02:49:33 Hi
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:22:59 Self-upvoting is generally frowned upon because it's a given
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:23:53 It's obvious that you'll like your own creation, so self-upvoting is just adding an extra point outside of the standard amount of likes/dislikes you're supposed to get
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:24:07 Which, while it doesn't REALLY matter, it's very scummy to be honest
creations-chat 2019-07-03 17:24:26 I know, I'm just explaining why
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 19:31:33 People have modeled what a 4d object, based on our understanding of dimensions, would be like
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 19:32:11 4D shadow as in a 4D shape projecting a 3D shadow, or a 5D shape projecting a 4D shadow?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:27:23 You're SURE he's copying?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:28:03 We aren't just going to make a giant mob and attack him you know
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:07 Also, a "bit" more of a depressing topic but does anyone have any advice for what to do if there's a family member who can only be described as both psychotic and egocentric to the highest degree, who refuses to get help on their own right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:15 Alright show them here
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:29:44 .......... Mhmmmm, <@!373016548832444426> , Get the fuck over here, **now**
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:30:16 It's not bullying, it's copying that's a major, major, **major** issue
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:30:57 Look, copying's fine with permission, but if you do not get explicit permission to copy the part you are replicating, well, people get **VERY** pissy
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:31:18 Let me just get this though Tin, copying, without permission, is __***NOT***__ fine, under any circumstances
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:31:39 It still is on your record, expect people to be mad and secretive around you
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:32:06 Tin, this isn't a matter of humiliation, it's a matter of being potentially banned you know, copiers absolutely **KILL** motivation
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:33:32 You can be re-warned <@!373016548832444426> , and if we get another report that you're copying, **TIN**, after you've promised to cease, we have every right to permanently ban you, and every other alternative account from Plane Crazy as a whole, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 06:34:49 Riiight, now then, as I've mentioned, there is one grey area where copying is allowed, and that's with the explicit and guaranteed permission of the other user, if someone allows you to copy the wings, you can copy the wings, and **ONLY** the wings, not the fuselage, not the cockpit, not the tail, just the wings
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:16:53 ?ban <@432885129917235211> NSFW content

the-dump 2019-07-04 21:17:01 The little fuck
plane-crazy 2019-07-04 21:19:17 Thanks Grablador by the way
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:21:07 It didn't save his damn thing, but I'm still going to throttle the fucker
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:23:21 If you still have the link, send it to me via DMs, and if you know his in-game username, send it to me as well
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:29:23 Grab, did you at LEAST grab who he was in-game?
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:31:34 I see it, bit hard to see though
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:32:51 Got it, thanks
the-dump 2019-07-04 21:35:07 Okay let's not talk about this anymore, so how's the weather?
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 03:58:59 Stridel, if it's easy to follow, and you're willing to take minimal credit for it, then it's tutorial-worthy
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:11:15 The amount of effort is, honestly, "meh", primarily because there's so little detailing, too many flat surfaces, etc
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:12:01 Well convert it into an actual platform of war, don't just leave it as a rusted box car
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:12:30 Add sawblades, barrels, hell, make the whole thing a missile silo, I expect it to be a segment of a fortress on rails
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:13:12 When I hear "apocalyptic boxcar", a military base on train tracks is what I picture
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:13:24 Well not LITERALLY, but you get the point
creations-chat 2019-07-05 04:14:29 I mean, we go overkill for a reason, for a very good reason, it's to really emphasize "Hey, this is supposed to be this thing"
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:07:36 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:07:54 Relaaaaax, I'm fine with being pinged, as long as it's not excessive
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:10:33 Oy, relax a bit King
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:21:28 @**AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH**, that's my take on that
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:21:42 I doubt they can
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:24:06 It's a joke Rex
bug-reports 2019-07-05 06:52:37 Wrong spot, and you need a rank to access servers, this is mostly to keep the average Roblox riffraff out of there, since said crowd tends to be, infuriating, to say the least
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:12:50 That is actually pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:18:27 I mean, Mega, it's the equivalent of throwing your sword, using it as a springboard, then teleporting the sword back in your hand in an uppercut-like move
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 17:20:42 Rev your engine
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:20:57 Uhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:21:15 <@!338393512389378059> , what are you trying to do exactly?
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:22:09 Then just use <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:23:12 It just feels suspiciously like you're trying to copy, and that might just be me being paranoid, but honestly we've had alot of issues with copiers lately

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:26:09 How bad was the quake Anti? I heard some people were getting a pretty bad one
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:17 Plane Crazy MC server, it's a pseudo-official server run by Voxel I think
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:39 ..... Right, role call, now
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:51:43 ..... <@!508314435945889802>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:52:43 IT IS NOT, FUCKING, FUNNY
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:53:55 Right, role call, if you're playing MC, say you're here, otherwise if I see your name on the list and you don't call, or the person leaves or goes afk and you say it afterwards, you'll be put on a suspicion list
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:57:26 <@285640703550423041> , <@!311996873650995200> , <@!302264107363598341> , <@!305196796278210571> , <@!434142224847208449> , <@456226577798135808> , <@!502014514880053249> , <@!268577499829633024> , <@!219915838193532928> , <@456226577798135808> , <@!339491942616268803> , <@!469290987286691860> , <@!414954293448146974> , <@!178767154785550338> , <@!276575595708809216> 

Who's "LegendOfCatBro"? I'm doing a role-call after we've had issues on the Plane Crazy MC server, and you're all suspect since you didn't check in, and he's still going on so it seems
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:57:41 AKA: His focus is in the server, and not here
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 04:59:34 Because we have an excessively toxic person in the MC server, and I'm combing over everyone playing MC right now to see who it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:00:09 The trick is, as soon as he/she/it looses focus, they'll likely have read the actions going on in here
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:01:32 Ask Voxel, but right now I'm trying to comb over potential suspects, at the very least get a reaction from him
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:01:51 Don't, ping him, I'll ask him to make an announcement about it or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:02:32 Did the person stop, or are they still going?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:13:09 Thanks for the info surpee, I'm just combing over people on the player list (Yes, the entire player list of all online people) for who it could be
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:16:33 That's the user?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:17:30 Must've bailed by this point
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:17:57 ............. Raptor
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:18:04 Was that you?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:18:41 Then how did they access the server, because Satan-kun isn't in the server
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:19:33 Then find out who the hell it is, that shit isn't fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:20:17 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:20:42 Tell him he will be permanently banned from every Innovation.Inc game, and every subsidy of it, if he doesn't clean up his fucking act
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:21:09 This includes the MC server, and any multiplayer server hosted by any member of the Plane Crazy community
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:22:23 And if he somehow breaks through, I'm going to ask a contact to take further action
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:23:55 Not Madattak
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:02 ..... <@!508314435945889802>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:13 The, **FUCK** are you trying to do honestly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:29 This, ISN'T a damn joke, now cut it out
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:24:54 Do it Legendary, they won't mind, and if someone's angry at you, tell them you had to go to the bathroom
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:25:00 Also g'night <@!429665143677255681>
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 05:32:13 Control panels Deciduus
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:52:52 What the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:53:49 What, the actual
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:53:52 Look at the sponsored ad
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:21 How though?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:47 Yeah <@!435946988559925248> , you can bug the system by hauling out constant "updates", I've found games that have a 20% like/dislike ratio up there
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:54:58 I'd suggest not, seems suspicious
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:55:08 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:56:02 And again, what the fuck? (I refreshed the page)
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 03:56:25 And ag- okay obviously alot of money was poured into the game to make it a sponsored ad, but what the fuck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:28:40 Right, what the heck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:29:11 Life stuff, very very stressful life stuff that I'd rather not talk about, now what the heck's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:29:49 Fonkl, if you really want to prove it, do a buoyancy test
plane-crazy 2019-07-08 21:30:16 Just take a screenshot of different blocks in water and that'll get rid of everyone's doubts
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:54:11 <@456226577798135808> , please don't self-upvote, while it doesn't matter much for the larger numbers, it's not exactly fair to do so, as obviously you'd like your own creation
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:54:37 Also, <@!435217108125876224> , how much more complexity can you add to it? You might be running for one of the major ranks
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:55:58 Not inventor of course, that one's pretty much well and truly done until Rick adds another component part, but potentially modeler
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:57:50 I mean, name another rube-goldberg device on Plane Crazy
creations-chat 2019-07-09 02:58:39 Well, good luck with the add-ons to the track
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:03:11 What's the problem <@!347918144062488586> , tracks keep on falling off?
creations-chat 2019-07-09 03:08:48 It's Empire's thing, don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:36:11 Uhhhhh, <@456226577798135808> , care to re-read the rules? I feel like this would fall under rule 2 somehow
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:42:28 Go a step further and make a mecha-peter
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:46:56 <@456226577798135808> , what is it with you and eggs?
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:47:10 Wait, wait wait wait wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:47:47 You've already been verified, Ro-Ver will auto-verify you if you've verified in another server
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:54:11 Blast it out with an even better, but less memorable song
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:54:25 Or something again, better, but less memorable
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:55:22 Why not you? You have the source material, the tools and (probably) the know-how
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 03:56:02 Ah, ouch
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 17:23:25 People have been asking for hinges for quite a while, however, there haven't been enough cases where they were absolutely necessary for hinges to be made
bot-central 2019-07-09 17:23:44 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 18:57:06 Well I think I know how to make a 3D printer, although it'd be very crude, and I'm not saying how
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:08:42 I'm fine honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 00:43:49 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:23 It happens to me to actually, or it did happen back in 2018
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:31 And no I'm not <13 FFS
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:47 .... Wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:16:50 <@!402617794606399488>
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:17:02 Okay who the fuck's letting unranked people into the damn VIP servers?
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:19:06 It's a server-wide thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:19:20 Also, <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:20:48 Well, I don't know, just don't cause problems in the VIP server and we'll be fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 14:22:46 It's a preemptive thing, somebody always forgets or, more often than not "forgets" and tries to cause problems
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 03:16:08 Dude
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:36:03 <@!303637849650233345> , What do you need help with exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:38:39 Ultimately I'd advise to try to find out yourself, you'll actually get alot better and smarter that way, if you really want help, describe it as best as possible
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 02:39:46 If you're trying to get it to walk, my advice: Walk yourself (No literally, get up and walk around a bit), and see what motions you do, what forces you apply, etc, then try to replicate it in-game as best as possible, and pay attention to even the most subtle of forces
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:39:13 Not a major bug, unless it actually saves their properties
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:39:51 Get a volunteer, have them change your keybinds and see if it does anything
bug-reports 2019-07-13 03:40:03 Also please no .wmv files, we've had a virus attack from one before
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 17:25:54 Bombers have heavier "missile" weaponry, fighters are faster and have stronger guns
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 17:26:38 Also, cap ships get DEMOLISHED by bombers, even though bombers are much bigger targets
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 18:39:24 If you're wondering about people under 13 years old, we've been pretty thorough with that
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 20:53:02 You mean a manual gyroscope, or just stabilization?
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 21:30:59 That won't work for a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:10:07 What is it with these damn pyramid schemes roping people in
plane-crazy 2019-07-13 22:32:24 We're testing Expanse now, feel free to join
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 18:41:38 .... <@456226577798135808> , don't DM another NSFW message to another person, or else, got it? (You already did that once, and were banned for that)

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:00:58 Ahem
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:01:28 Right, why is there a dumpster fire here that I can literally see from a mile off (Jokes aside, what's going on exactly?)
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:01 <@!471502263182032898> , we have <#495286269459300364> for a reason, not to mention you've been spamming the same stuff quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:13 That's why we direct you to <#533294912586645521> first, so you can't go "I didn't see the rules"
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:24 How about I drag you back there, so you ACTUALLY read the rules this time
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:02:58 Actually not the worst believe it or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:03:44 I seriously doubt you actually read the rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:04:56 General summary of 13 and 14 in 15 seconds, go
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:05:14 Time's up
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:06:08 That's why I said "in 15 seconds"
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 23:06:18 So you couldn't really read the rules, you'd have to recite them
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:14 <@!271783384710250508> , do you want help or not?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:15:39 People always beg that for whatever reason, no idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:11 A boat can carry alot more weight without having to worry as much about damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:18:27 Doubly so on Roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:24 <@!238017332872478720> , give it a bit of a lead and that thing will be nightmarish
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:26:52 You do realize that's called center of mass, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:27:22 Also, Neutro, if you can script that, alternate between a lead shot and a shot at the target, and you'll butcher whatever you target
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:28:56 So you mean center of lift on individual areas?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:19 That'd be nice, but hard to implement, think of how you'd get what you want
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:36 Also, enqrises, how can he get up 1K if he can't get off the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:29:47 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:01 My suggestion: Lob it off the back end, or tie a GIANT helium rig to it, lift it up into the air, and see what happens
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:10 Well, once you disconnect it that is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:30:21 I'd suggest using 0,0,0 TNT blocks to avoid any leftover parts, instead of disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:01 Why don't you balance out the helium then?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:31:23 Then replace some blocks with helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:16 Enqrises knows what I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:32:28 And if the back's heavy, then you're gonna tilt backwards, not forwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:18 You have too much weight at the front then
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:33:36 You're probably pulling down when you do eventually somehow take off, correct?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:39 There's 3 potential issues
Too much weight at the front, or too little weight at the back
Too little lift in the front, or too much lift in the back
Too much power up high, or too little power down low
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:45 And helium doesn't count to your center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:34:53 It's something that's really buggy
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:35:05 Ballasts then? Check your center of lift as well
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:04 Enqrises, I'm able to make 1.7K creations fly like god damn 300 block superfighters, I'm pretty sure I'm more qualified, are you able to pitch upwards golden?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:36:45 That's not flying
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:37:04 Look, strap a super rocket on and see what the result is, if you pitch downwards still, your center of lift's too far back
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:37:27 Even if you want to stick with a theme, super rockets are a good test to see what the behavior's like
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 01:57:46 Minecraft scripting, specifically a turret
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:00:45 Probably a stress or variance test?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 02:02:34 What I want to know, Neutronium, can you make a homing projectile turret?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:47:30 The hell's going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:47:45 Right, break it up all of you, what's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:48:16 I'll start with the apparent problem, <@!402133971040731146> , what are you going on about exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:48:42 Then why are you butting into a random conversation going "shut up" "shut up"?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:49:19 .... "Why not", you're an asshole if you do that, that's why not
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:12 .... <@!402133971040731146> , What, exactly, are you trying to do exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:19 Don't even start
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:50:49 If you REALLY want, I can show you true harassment, but I won't
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:51:26 .... How is this harassment exactly? By asking you questions about what you're doing, when you're obviously bothering other people
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:51:43 And I'm gonna ban you if you don't cut this damn acting
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:52:04 Right, enough with this idiot
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:57:13 Oh for fuck's
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:58:36 I already whack-a-moled them both
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 18:59:37 I mean, I TRIED to help them and to snap them out of whatever the hell they were thinking of doing
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:03:07 HMW, what are you on about?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:03:32 Innocent until proven guilty
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:06 Fonkl, again, innocent until proven guilty
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:18 It only takes a heartbeat to snipe them down
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:04:49 Meanwhile I'm going to snipe their Roblox account, and likely freeze their precious assets
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:06:40 PFFHAAAHAHAHAAAHHH, guess what the idiot did?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:08 He tried using a blank mule account to join our server, but then he joined on his main account with stuff on it
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:22 This is the dumbass I'm sniping now https://www.roblox.com/users/169410004/profile
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:32 Here's their mule account https://www.roblox.com/users/749194697/profile
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:49 **HAAAHAHAHAHAHAAAAHHHHH**
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:07:58 Hello there
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:08:16 We're just laughing at how someone had caused a shitstorm and I tracked it back to their main account
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:08:28 Anyways, welcome to the Plane Crazy Discord server, enjoy the madness
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:09 Fonkl, he's not an alt, he didn't cause a shitstorm as soon as he joined
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:21 Fairly certain
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:09:52 <@!600401420587368515> , as you may or may not see in <#514788946140594196> , we've had a bit of an alt raid happen, hence why we're all on edge here
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:11:59 I've taken a break from Plane Crazy Burning, so sorry, but no thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:17 Manually build a propeller engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:14:26 You have propeller blades in the wings section, you have motors, manually build one
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:24:50 What, the, fffff-
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:02 NO WONDER IT DOESN'T FLY
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:25:37 Right, first of all, scale it up, it looks like it's made of legos, and not the tiny intricate ones either, the giant ones babies use
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:11 Second, change the tail fin and extend the front, the tail needs to be an actual control surface
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:26:21 Third, make an ACTUAL propeller, it's large enough to support one, so why don't you do so?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:04 ...........
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:05 Golden
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:14 The thing is, you need greater size to add greater detail
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:35 If you're trying to make it proportional to your character as real life, that's not gonna work
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:47 <@!185912072658223104> , it is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:28:53 And it would spin
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:30:00 <@!271783384710250508> , you need to scale up to add proper detail, otherwise it won't work, I don't care what you think, keeping it to proportion doesn't work in this game, and that's a limitation of the Roblox engine mostly
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:10 Then feel free to make poor creations, both aesthetically and functionally, there's a reason we didn't have true to life graphics back in the 1990s
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:38 There's various limitations that can't be overcome, and in this case, we're probably running at the limits of an aerodynamic physics based building game
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:31:45 At least on Roblox that is
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:32:06 ~~Steam release of Plane Crazy when?~~
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:09 Golden, you've either gotta settle for function, or fashion, or if you make a custom creation, you can TRY to stretch for both, but you need a much deeper knowledge of the game than you currently have
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:33:50 You're trying to go for both, making it function while trying to stick with a theme
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:02 Which, **WILL NOT** work, at least for most creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:24 Certain creations are capable of being highly aesthetically pleasing while also functioning very nicely, but most creations focus in one or the other
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:34:44 Then take our advice and don't just bat it to the side out of "stubbornness" otherwise it's that same excuse that'll tie you down
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:35:53 Then don't expect to improve
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:17 We didn't invent lightbulbs without the knowledge of electricity
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:36:37 Right, let me just clear this up, hold on
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:03 <@!351507429286215680> , How old are you exactly? We need to ask due to Discord's terms of service enforcing a legal age for their platform
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:23 ...............................
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:31 <@!351507429286215680> , explain
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:37:59 If you know why we're asking, "web.roblox.com" is the link that people arrive at when they're under 13 years old as per Roblox's standards
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:38:19 So, don't fuck with us, give us a good explanation, or please leave on your own accord and come back when you're over 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:38:38 Because if we have reason to believe you're <13, we can all get in legal trouble if we or you don't take action
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:39:00 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:46:57 Hey, a piano
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 19:47:01 Also hey, Terraria
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 21:12:45 It is actually irritating to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 21:12:53 It just makes you seem really immature
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:30:45 Oh you're fucking, ....... how'd none of you get it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 22:31:40 How did absolutely NOBODY pick that up?
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:30:41 It's still fucking NSFW dude
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:31:39 I can monetize my ass on the camera, and that's still NSFW you know
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:32:11 "um", yes I have "bruh"
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:33:36 Might I direct you to rule 11, because apparently you need a fresh helping of that
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:34:58 ...... Seriously?
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:35:18 He tried pulling up a song with a very ... blunt, title, and we shut him down
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:35:40 Oh for fuck's, don't ...
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:37:41 First of all, I get to bend rule 1, when I'm (metaphorically) beating some sense into some idiot who thinks they're above the rules, I'm not saying who, but I am going to say that I've had to do that alot, with alot of people, some to the point of trying to downright ruin other people just for the shit of it
Second, no amount of arguing will clear up what you tried to post
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:38:44 There's some people you can't be nice to, hence why there's flexibility in rule 1 for mods, because people are people, and some people are just plain assholes, and you can't talk nicely to assholes
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:05 Ow
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:12 =skip
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:39:17 Okay no ow
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:51:37 =stop
bot-central 2019-07-16 02:51:42 =skip
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 03:59:10 Right what the fuck's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 03:59:36 I come back on and I see a god damn dumpster fire happening over here so catch me up on what happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:00:05 I mean a dumpster fire compared to how it usually is
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:02:21 .............. Right, can it for a moment, and let me explain, causing a problem, and trying to nudge it under the rug, doesn't make you innocent, so we still have every right to punish you for that, even if it's past, but not if it's already done
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:02:35 Anti, just drop it, we'll take it from here
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:03:21 You do realize we're trying to halt arguments, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 04:04:24 Just, DROP IT, AND MOVE ON FROM THIS
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 18:14:49 .... <@!600401420587368515> , are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 18:14:58 Legitimately, are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 18:15:12 ?warnings <@!600401420587368515>
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 18:15:52 God fucking, <@!600401420587368515> , can you QUIT being an asshole/smartass/whatever to every single person in the server? We're all loosing our collective patience with you
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 19:54:51 I'm surprised nobody noticed it was actually him
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:02:45 Guys, relax for the love of heck
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:03:58 Do you have a role sheet or something <@!454809803223465984> ? I don't remember your roles exactly, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:05:08 Just because he's the most active doesn't mean he was the most justified
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:05:18 Also that wasn't me, I'm guessing it was Super or Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:05:36 Chaos, that's what's going on
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:05:52 Can't edit nicknames, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 20:08:10 I'm just gonna stay out of this chaos
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:09:46 I join and I see this, what the hell's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:10:40 It's up to you, let me just save your roles first
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:10:46 Ah, nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:11:56 It's up to you if you want to <@!454809803223465984> , I've logged your roles so if you want to come back, I'll give you it again, not that you had any roles aside from being a community contributor
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:12:38 I have no idea, ask him why
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:12:42 It was prooobably a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:12:54 Okay okay okay seriously guys this is getting out of hand
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:13:50 I know troll, sorry about that, it's just paranoia because we can get in serious trouble otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:14:22 Can BOTH SIDES CALM THE FUCK DOWN!? This isn't gonna work for either side
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:14:39 Empire, not helping
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:15:57 You need a rank to change colors I think, other than novice
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:16:57 Empire, can you not? It's causing a freaking headache
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:17:52 God fucking, DANNY, SPY, EMPIRE, BREAK IT THE FUCK UP, if anyone deserves to be pissed at Empire it's me, and quite frankly I'm not grabbing a mace and smashing his face with it now am I?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:18:36 Now, can we PLEASE put this on pause for a moment and talk about something civil? I need food, but I'll shout when I'm back, and I'll monitor both sides for a civil discussion, is that fine?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:19:37 Troll, "PFP", not "PP", we get "Profile Picture", but people have been making it inappropriate
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:20:02 And I don't know, just drop it honestly please, if anyone starts it up, ping me and I'll get them to stop
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:20:12 ....................
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:20:31 God damn it guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:20:57 Just, don't start a dumpster fire while I'm gone or so help me I'm gonna be god damn pissed
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:29:37 Right I'm back what the heck happened exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:30:41 Baris, are you ACTUALLY serious on that, or are you just angry at Troll for whatever reason?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:31:12 ................
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:31:24 I think I know why, and quite frankly it's absurd guys
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:32:03 Wait wait wait wait, Brick, are you serious?
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:32:54 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 22:35:07 Alright, I think I'm gonna take five from this
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 23:28:43 That's a scam site
plane-crazy 2019-07-16 23:28:56 Then why did you share it here?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:34:41 Meanwhile over here
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:16 Very efficiently, that's how
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:35:58 Probably
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:36:25 I'm almost certain it has infact been built
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:36:57 .... If you're trying to get modeler for that, you aren't going to get it
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:38:05 ..... I sense a DragonMage build coming up (Yes, that's bad by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:38:30 Or was it the other guy? Don't remember, either way
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:39:00 Long story a long time ago
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:39:07 What?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:39:23 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:47:38 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:48:14 Like doing a canyon run?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:04 We haven't, but if you're doing it slowly, it's not that interesting
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:37 With what creation?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:50:57 Something like this tops out at about 600, and is pretty wide
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:51:14 Hmmm, you're allowed to post the video
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:51:26 Go for it, let's see
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:08 Meh, tiny creation, under 150 speed, not exactly the hardest
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:26 Also mouse controls
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:53:50 I haven't, because I have a creation that doesn't even fit in the canyon
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 17:54:53 To be honest I probably could nail it if I wanted to specialize a creation for it, I don't have the time though
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:27:03 I'm staying out of this by the way, so don't call on me for anything, and I mean that to both sides
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:29:25 <@!282630784928710657> , it's, long, and complicated, to the point where I'm not getting involved with it like I mentioned
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:29:58 Just leave it at "It's an ongoing problem of high debate"
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:30:48 Probably because some members are waking up while others are going to sleep, no idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:31:34 Personally I would've bashed your face in with a warn for that one comment, but aside from that, not really much else, unless you really are causing problems
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:11 Are you actually in the mod chat?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:38 Then say how much robux Super just bet
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:36:49 ._.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:38:18 They shouldn't be able to, the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:38:36 Oh for the love of
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:39:12 How though? Like, seriously
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:39:27 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:40:14 Say what number I just typed right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:40:45 Voxel! Damn it, that was supposed to tell if it was a joke or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:41:55 Okay but seriously though guys, mod chat's supposed to be for really trusted people, if you can see inside of it, please don't leak it out to the average numbskull, they might take it the wrong way
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 22:42:37 I said "**if**" you can see in
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:39:35 Roblox military group?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:42:27 Give them a middlefinger and leave, all of them are nothing but garbage
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:45:20 They're desperate, let's face it, anyone using the ads are horrid
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:47:05 There's literally a game that's a running joke about border groups
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 01:21:50 Lots of people in the VC
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 18:29:36 71 shots in one instant, that's why I don't play games like that anymore
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 18:36:49 I really hate games with semi-auto mechanics, for 2 primary reasons
1: More often than not they're unlimited or very rapid, so you can just hook up an autoclicker and go nuts
2: They're finger harm simulators basically, it's actually not healthy to click rapid fire on a pistol, even if it's more efficient in-game
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:05 Right, <@456226577798135808> , I need to ask, how old are you?
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:35 Robo! Let them leave on their own accord
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:23:54 If he openly admits his age, he's probably willing to leave on his own accord after recognizing it's not okay to stay in the server
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:28:38 Looks decent, too many flat surfaces though, so try to make it more detailed
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:53:03 Oh hey, what's this? (The background's just because)
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:53:57 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:56:33 It's actually in studio, just like my last one
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:57:20 It's supposed to be a cockpit for a new fighter
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:57:43 Whatever, you get the point
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:10 It's not yet finished by the way, just wanted to show I was working on something
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:23 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:58:28 And I think you mean Astrocraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 21:01:35 It is my own <@!282630784928710657>
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 21:04:12 I mean, I did make this as my second build in studio, sooo
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:10:28 <@!435217108125876224> , Beck's actually from Mighty Number 9, which was basically supposed to continue the Megaman legacy, but failed so hard it was downright disappointing
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:10:49 I think Mighty Gunvolt was supposed to be a cross-promotion thing
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:11:06 Not alot actually
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:13:52 To each their own I suppose, I'd suggest next time you cite pixel art like that, you cite what it is, where it's normally from, and if it's a franchise, what specifically it's from
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:14:31 That's mostly to avoid confusion in all honesty
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 01:18:26 Do not reach to me for comment on that, I'm going to remain neutral and not take either side aside from if he actually breaks one or more of the rules
creations-chat 2019-07-19 01:20:44 Now attach that torpedo station to something and then we're getting somewhere, maybe an RC boat or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 01:27:42 <@!318892614378061824> , I didn't fucking ban him, I can't show who, but it's not me, I'm remaining NEUTRAL ON THIS ya dum dum
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:05:05 Why not both?
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:05:48 Then how about unique military craft? Rather than F-16s and such
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:15:18 Meh, I'm not gonna participate in the contest anyways, sooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:15:40 I'm more interested in just designing my own thing in studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:16:18 I need a wider variety of parts than Astrocraft can offer
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:16:26 Yes, even Astrocraft doesn't have enough parts for what I'm planning right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:17:10 I need the ability to negate stuff to smooth it out, otherwise I'll never get the angles I need
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 21:17:26 At least not without making it 30 billion fucking parts
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:13:41 ............
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:09 They were actually NSFW
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:17 I did look close to make sure
the-dump 2019-07-19 23:14:54 I don't bash people over the head for NSFW jokes unless they well and truly deserve it
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:04:10 How aggressive are you with it exactly <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:04:55 ............. You do realize trolling people can get you permanently banned from all Innovation Inc games, including Plane Crazy, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:03 Coaxial helis will help
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:04 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:08 <@456226577798135808> , no it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:29 I guess he's saying thanks?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:06:44 Or, not
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:07:08 I use pings for 2 reasons, 
1: To get people's attention
2: To direct messages at people if I'm talking to multiple at once
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:08:10 <@!592040876117590028> , tutorials exist to guide you to the creation of something in the simplest manner possible, if you can't follow a step-by-step procedure one (Which most of the ones we have are), then you aren't going to learn anything else from us
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:08:42 Nothing really
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:10:25 <@263770097288609794> , <#495286269459300364>
general 2019-07-20 01:10:48 Looks nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:14:25 .wmvs may contain viruses, didn't we already go over this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:36:48 .... Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:36:54 <@!209126251271553025> Really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:37:27 Yes I know ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:37:46 You don't get to fucking apologize ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:38:00 ?warnings <@!209126251271553025>
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:38:05 .................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:43:06 The idiot's ban is permanent on the grounds of MULTIPLE fucking NSFW jokes ... I swear people like that need to just have their eyes burned
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:45:17 How I go about building my Studio creations:
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:46:08 It's a lighting effect
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:48:18 Oh my freaking gordnfuckingbloodybenedictarnoldcumberbatch this thing is a nightmare, but I could see it combined for a split second, it looks **SOO GOOD**
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:50:12 It's an ongoing phrase I've been trying to extend further and further, if you have any add-ons to attach to it, send em to me
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:51:48 I don't want an ending one like "The Queen", because that would leave no room for expanding
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:02:21 **Really guys?** __**REALLY!?**__
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:02:36 God damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:32:30 <@!541363739253932032> , You do realize that that'd likely require a complete rework, right? It wasn't designed with a scale tool in mind
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:46:37 .... <@!317775063845699584> , really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 16:46:58 ?warnings <@!317775063845699584>
creations-chat 2019-07-21 19:18:55 Well that's definitely very impressive
creations-chat 2019-07-21 19:26:39 Try extendable bumpers on either side, alongside guiderails
creations-chat 2019-07-21 21:45:40 Huh, cool I guess
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:01:26 Not now, busy
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:01:30 <@!429665143677255681>  **OY**
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:01:46 Weren't you banned for something mateo?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:02:29 Oh, sorry, I'm just a bit paranoid and, a bit infuriated now
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:10:28 <@!501093836765003789> , <#495286269459300364> , that's literally where "no u"s are supposed to go
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:10:44 And Terrains, make 1/50 or 1/100 parts wing panels, if it flies, it's fast as hell
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:40 If it's going fast enough, those wing panels will generate enough lift to launch it into the air
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:50 And if it's going that fast, well obviously it's going crazy fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:29 Terrains, use the wing panels to test it, then remove them once you're done
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:33 Duhdoyduhdr
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:54 And <@!501093836765003789> , let me ask, and answer honestly, how old are you exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:14 God damn it guys, why must you meme everything about me? (Not actually complaining, but still)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:28 And you're actually 14 and not just lying? Because it's legal issues you can run into
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:13:52 I'm trying to loosen up a bit honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:45:42 The heck is that <@456226577798135808> ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:45:58 Huh, alright then
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:54:10 Pretty much everything that could be invented possible was infact invented
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:54:36 They're simply pistons basically, so yes, those were invented
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:55:44 The only thing I can think of would be a SABOT style round that actually works
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:56:01 A type of tank round
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:56:19 https://hips.hearstapps.com/pop.h-cdn.co/assets/17/43/1024x768/sd-aspect-1508955082-suspicious-object.jpg?resize=480:*
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:56:28 https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00ca42ed748dd4f6966eaafd8530fb50.webp
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:03 It'd actually have to use some degree of propulsion that mimics the actual reason why SABOTs are use by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:05 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:11 More reading here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:34 Nope, sorry battleship
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:57:57 Still no, that's been done before on other mechanisms
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:07 That's basically the design of a SABOT, but they're still pretty damn effective
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:24 Like I said, SABOT round
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 21:59:29 There is, it's called the rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:01:08 I'm expecting magnets to simulate the barrel propulsion, at least 3 rounds fired (Aka: It needs to be reloadable), and I expect one of the diagrams shown for the shell, with a noticeable increase or maintenance of shell velocity once exiting the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:01:49 I already have a theoretical idea in my head, but I want to see what you all can do
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:02:14 One at a time, coaxial cannons aren't useful in modern day tank based combat
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:03:21 The first challenge would be making a shell that can be affected by at minimum 9 magnets, while shearing off afterwards
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:03:31 It detaches once it exits the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:04:58 That's called Simple Planes, although Simple Planes costs money and doesn't have a working multiplayer (I think)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:05:08 At minimum two pieces, preferably three
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:06:17 I've already got an idea on how to do it with just a 3X3 area FYI
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:09:44 If you could, a regular shell to be fired alongside it would be helpful as a comparison
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:21:55 I mean, if it works, it works, it's just gotta follow the criteria I laid out, and of course the pointy tip needs to actually face the enemy
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:24:39 Criteria:
Must be affected by at minimum 9 magnets until it exits the barrel
Exterior must detach cleanly for an actual reason (Not just for show)
Shell must be stabilized forwards
Shell must maintain velocity
Must be able to reload twice (Fire 3 shells in total)
Cannon can't be absurdly oversized
Bonus points if you can load natural shells for a comparison
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:25:24 You can't make a casing smaller than a 3X3 without loosing the actual middle section
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:25:59 So I expect at least 9 magnets in a 3X3 pattern on the back to be able to affect it, because otherwise you're just lobbing an empty shell out for no purpose
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:26:53 Wouldn't count
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:18 That'd be nice as well, but not needed
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:34 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:27:55 And honestly, if there's a SABOT that actually works, that'd be impressive
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:30:43 Criteria <@456226577798135808> :
Must be affected by at minimum 9 magnets until it exits the barrel
Exterior must detach cleanly for an actual reason (Not just for show)
Shell must be stabilized forwards
Shell must maintain velocity
Must be able to reload twice (Fire 3 shells in total)
Cannon can't be absurdly oversized
Bonus points if you can load natural shells for a comparison

Do that and you've invented SABOT rounds in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:36 What do you mean? Like launching the whole thing?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:45 Also *nsfw pfp!* (I know it's a joke by the way)
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:31:53 Ah, yeah no that's already done multiple times over
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:32:13 By absurdly I mean like no 10X10 sized barrels, just for an extreme demonstration
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:33:29 That's an extreme example
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:33:46 Basically the smaller it is, the better
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 22:58:25 Show us when you're done?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:14:32 Alright, let's see it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:17:01 It seems like the SABOT shell would actually catch with the round it's self, not to mention 4 delta 1X2s would slow it down quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:19:55 Hmmmm, I sorta had different ideas on how it'd look honestly, although I'd probably have to build it to show what I mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:06:35 That's Plane Crazy for ya
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:10:17 I'm probably gonna take a break, really tired here
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:10:42 Check <#544022464133595166> and submit creations to <#504436696021204992> , a bot will automatically port it over, and no novice doesn't count since it's so easy to get
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:49:39 It won't work
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:49:56 Magnets don't affect other creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:50:10 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 06:51:29 I guarantee you that magnets attracting to other vehicles is something alot of people want
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:49:01 The reason why rockets aren't pinpoint accurate is because that'd be pretty overpowered, as it stands they are **really** powerful in terms of damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:59:18 I need an idea for a neck joint for a mech
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 20:59:29 I'm doing it in studio, so go nuts, I can probably shape it easily
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:13 Something like this, but less flimsy looking https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545451337261907968/602541091849240606/Capture_61.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:32 Question, are you english, or are you using a translator? <@!450038814199775242>
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:00:51 No to english, or translator?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:01:21 Then no offense but your english is very broken, and I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:04:50 You mean a manually guided missile? In theory you can shoot down anything with one of those, assuming you can
1: Actually hit the target
2: Load enough payload on
3: Avoid getting hit in the payload
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:05:41 That ain't that effective, 1 TNT block is like 1 rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:06:48 Ah, well still it's not that strong, it's gonna detonate all at once, try making a tandem detonation system
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:06:52 Actually, hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:15:48 Also I'm trying to open up inventor stuff honestly, mostly so people quit complaining about never getting inventor
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:16:03 Basically a functional use aside from just looking cool is my primary goal
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:16:22 I'm still waiting for others' opinions on tandem charges, but with any luck it'll be inventor-worthy
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:17:15 .... Uhhhh, what?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:18:00 First of all, space is a color role, second of all, there's no moon in Plane Crazy, people have literally flung themselves with literal infinite speed straight upwards and they haven't hit the moon, so you're obviously bullshitting us there
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:18:55 .... <@!401515741905420289> , We can tell it's fake, don't lie to us
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:19:39 I mean, +5 points for the moon editing, -50 for lying and for being an edit, you need to make the sequence actually more realistic, and use the actual sounds
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:20:32 If you can genuinely make a Plane Crazy-like lunar surface, then I'll be impressed, but as it stands it feels like you just cheaply went to studio and did some stop motion
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:21:05 Why don't you become the first?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:21:36 Then there's your answer
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 21:23:13 Honestly, this one of mine took about 2-3 months of getting inspiration, but 1-2 days once I got the inspiration and planning done
creations-chat 2019-07-23 23:10:32 Sure
creations-chat 2019-07-23 23:11:16 Done
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 04:12:08 If you're being toasted by a gun turret, you've got a bad build, either amp up it's speed, armor or maneuverability and fight back
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:29:53 ...... <@!401515741905420289> , you're kidding, right?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:05 Question, how old are you?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:19 I need to ask for legal reasons
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:43 **for legal reasons**
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:30:49 And alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:31:16 You certainly don't act like it, but I guess I'll take your word for it
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:31:45 If we find out you're under 13 later though you can get in *serious* trouble, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:32:11 Oh wait that was a joke, couldn't tell
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 05:33:03 Maybe you could, I don't know, make an actual joke? (Rude jokes aside though it is pretty hard to tell when some people are joking, namely on Roblox)
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:03 .....................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:22 What the fuck are you two talking about?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:36:45 ..........................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:18 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:25 Fuck, hold on

plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:37:38 ?clearwarn <@!479273717609005059>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:08 There we go, cleared em out, now then
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:18 Because I accidentally did a double warn
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:38:58 I can look up the chat you know ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:18 ............. You know what all three of you fucking, just,
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:44 <@456226577798135808> , I'm letting you off, but just fucking barely, I swear if this wasn't as confusing as it was I'd fucking throttle people
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:39:55 JUST LET IT BE AND DON'T CONTINUE ON WITH IT, YOU IDIOTS SHOULD KNOW BETTER
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:36 You said something else, that's what I'm warning you for <@438884464060399630>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:38 ..............
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:48 ........................................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:56 Furious, why?
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:40:59 ?warnings <@438884464060399630>
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:13 ...........................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:35 Noobing, I'm leaving that one warn in just because of that fucking comment
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:41:47 And to be honest 3 of those warns are expired
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:42:09 1 month, give or take
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:42:21 Some last longer due to their severity
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:08 I need ideas for a mech neck, one that can rotate 90 degrees at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:23 Not in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:30 In studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:48:48 I can make it move easily (Well, not easily, but I'll make it work), but I need something aesthetically pleasing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:49:32 I mean something like this, except less flimsy looking https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545451337261907968/602541091849240606/Capture_61.PNG
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:49:53 Furious I will fucking hang you ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:05 You know, I'm just gonna back out of this, I'm gonna keep on working on this thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:35 For an idea of what I'm working on (If you know about Roblox solid modeling, you'll know how much of an ass this is)
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:51:53 It gets worse, much worse
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:52:20 Infact, I could show you literally the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:54:36 So, I had to do all of this
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 19:54:41 To get this
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 21:33:01 You can counter him by saying "There aren't even that many YT accounts in the entire world combined"
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:09:55 The fuck is even going on here?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:10:42 You can't edit other people's messages on Discord
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:11:15 ............
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:13:15 .............................
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:13:54 I swear if I'm spending my time for nothing I'm going to god damn throttle someone, I was preparing to work on my build again after getting inspiration when THIS happened
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:14:36 Giving this a fuselage at the back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:15:09 This is the fuck I had to do to get it looking like that by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:15:43 And no I'm not interested in a battle now, I'm interested in fixing this battle, then getting the shape done, then adding details to it later, so no I'm not gonna add the neon thing yet <@456226577798135808> , but I am going to potentially add it later
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:16:14 JUST SHUT UP AND LET ME SCROLL BACK UP AND BE THE JUDGE, I already lost the inspiration already
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:18:30 Jesus fucking, <@456226577798135808> , just drop it, both of you were wrong in your own ways
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:15 Noc took the joke too far while Baris not only got too insulted, but also reacted in a bit of an explosive way
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:26 And it's not a boat Battleship, it's the head part of a fighter
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:42 Although I'll post this so you get an idea of what I'm planning for it to do later
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:19:52 And nobody would've because everyone would've realized it's a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:20:32 Then why aren't I freaking out about all the memes people make about me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:05 Just, fucking, I'll unpin it and I don't want to hear this again, if it's still going on I'm going to hang (not literally) whoever's continuing it still, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:16 Infact it's already unpinned god damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:26 So just drop it and leave it be
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:21:50 I need inspiration for a fuselage
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:22:26 ................. Fucking, <@456226577798135808> , can you at least can it until I'm back? I need to go for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:33:22 Right now I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:33:36 Also, Danny, Noc, what levels are you in there?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:34:15 Entry Point, it's basically Payday 2 with more of a focus on tactics and stealth than blowing shit up
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:34:37 Yes, I said I'm back
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:35:45 22 merc, 14 hacker, although I own a fully modded F57 and a CBR-C
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:36:18 And <@456226577798135808> , that isn't true, an offensive word, even if removed, is still highly offensive to a large group of people, their pin of the image was just a joke that anyone with a brain could tell was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:37:18 I have an S97 for stealth, silenced and decked out, but not visible, meanwhile the F57 isn't suppressed, but it is concealed, and it's pretty nicely modded
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:37:48 I've had bad luck with the shotgun then, because I haven't gotten the best of luck with it, one guy keeps on eating all the shots
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:38:26 Honestly, I'm all-range with the CH-A
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:09 Mine's for both honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:40 ................................................................
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:39:57 Right, before I get to that, honestly I don't find the shotgun useful, I prefer ARs
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:26 Now then, <@456226577798135808> , why the fuck, do you not get, that it was a joke, that anyone would get? If someone thought you were really gay, tell them "It's an in-running joke"
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:38 And the F57 is better than the sawblade in everything except ammo capacity honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:40:54 And so far, even with the short mag, I've never ran out of mag size
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:41:03 Er, I mean bullets, soooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:41:07 God I'm tired now
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:42:20 ............ <@456226577798135808> , if it well and truly has gone too far then people would be saying you're gay, but do you see anyone saying that? Plus if they do, you have full power to shoot it down god fucking damn it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:42:48 Now can you PLEASE just drop it, if it truly was just that problematic, don't you think I'd be blowtorching Noc by this point?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:44:24 Just, <@456226577798135808> , if someone is problematic, let me know, and I'll shut them the fuck down and beat up Noc for it, but until that happens, DROP IT, **UNDERSTOOD!?**
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:45:14 If it has gone too far then someone would've made a "BARIS IS GAY" statement at this point, but incase you didn't notice, nobody took it as anything other than a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:04 ................................ Right, right right right, all of you, cut it out, leave it between me and him, talk about Entry Point or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:25 **Now then**, <@456226577798135808> , can you, **PLEASE** __***FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK***__ just drop it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:35 If someone says you're gay, or asks that, ping me
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:44 And then I'll throttle Noc and everyone who was related to the joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:46:57 But until then, assume everyone realized it was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:47:04 Does that seem fair?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:47:14 Then get over it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:48:02 Add a bit of fire coming from my mouth, but not straight firebreath onto whoever I'm destroying (In this case Baris), and it'll be accurate
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:48:16 And quite frankly Baris like I said it was a joke that every single fucking person understood as a god damn joke
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:50:36 Baris, quite honestly I'll keep watch and see if anyone throws a fit, but as it stands, barely anyone checks pings, and those that do will notice a plethora of jokes there, so I don't think they'll think it's actually serious
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:50:52 The heck?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:02 Because boosts decay Turbo
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:53 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:53 It's because many people who boosted thought that would elevate them above the rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:16 Yes, iron cross
No, you can't avoid rules
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:30 I mean, how hard of a conversion is it exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:54 Mostly in-game, we can murder people in the server, but not in-game
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:59 And wait what you have server folders?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:53:30 I mean, I know they're a thing, but I don't have them, so RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:53:41 Oh there we go
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:55:35 ?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:55:55 Too much in what way exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:56:20 Ah, ehhhh, I'd probably say it's not too much, although that's just my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:56:45 Make this, but in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:57:31 Well I have no idea what to make then
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:57:59 I'm busy trying to make the fuselage of a special fighter, I've got no inspiration to spare for other people
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:58:13 And <@!249373398612967441> , surprisingly enough you sorta nailed what I was making
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:58:57 The thing I'm making? Probably not, but who knows
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:59:14 Oh not in Plane Crazy of course, that'd just be mental
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:57:03 Hold up, that wing and fuselage pattern, <@!287233830576848906> , I think I've got the picture back again, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:58:08 Trying to build a special fighter, so far I've done this as the front/head part of it
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:58:24 I had inspiration for it, but it kinda broke, yet that picture sorta helped, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 00:59:33 It's not Plane Crazy, it's studio
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:04:10 Excuse me?
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:04:25 God fucking, <@!355123674954858496>  ......
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:05:22 God fucking damn it dude
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:06:02 I'll just delete that, I swear if you do anything like that again though I'm gonna hang ya (not literally)
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 04:06:55 I *sorta* get what you're doing, but at the same time, come on
plane-crazy 2019-07-26 22:36:22 I mean, the whole point of SABOT rounds is to take advantage of the extra propellant to maintain accuracy
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:18:08 Tell him copying is bannable and you already recorded his username for both Rick and Madattak
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:17 Is he the one copying?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:38 .......................
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:19:52 <@!268493565548560384> , joking or not, copying is the absolute number one way to kill creativity
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:20:16 Now, if you asked permission, and Dark agreed, you're allowed to copy whatever part he agreed to, so if you ask to copy the cockpit, and he agrees, you can copy the cockpit, and only the cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 04:21:28 But as it stands, don't do that, you just look like an actual asshole, and even if nobody's there to strictly ban you, you're still gonna be looked at as nothing more than a generic lowlife scumbag that most of society wants to burn off with a plasma torch, because that's the kind of person that knowingly does these things
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:36:42 Really guys? Just, really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:36:56 <@!252094891448860673> , are you actually serious?
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 05:37:26 You know what, I'm not getting involved in this, if Rick rages at you then so be it
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 00:25:06 He's one tiny bit from leveling up
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:28:26 Sorry, busy developing something for a game, got IRL stuff, etc, <@!563785481570091037> , care to explain please?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:30:13 It's mostly IRL stuff trying to murder me with what I can only metaphorically describe as rocket powered chainsaws (Not literally trying to murder me), but yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:32:38 Good luck painting your house with that
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:34:20 <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:37:11 Well then, huh
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:49:27 The mini/mega shark are rotary guns, sooooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:51:13 Well if it's an upgrade of the minishark
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:51:49 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 00:51:57 Also, what about it not being rotary? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/steamtradingcards/images/d/d3/Terraria_Foil_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20131125103230

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:03:58 Also I heard you liked rainbows https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/calamitymod_gamepedia_en/4/4b/Elemental_Eruption_%28demo%29.gif?version=e2963b5379679dd7bbbf77e03c535200
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:04:19 Ah, basically it's a rainbow flamethrower
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:05:21 There's one that gives a screen-filling fire tornado
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:05:38 For the low low cost of 500 mana, you get to do this https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/calamitymod_gamepedia_en/c/c6/The_Wand_%28demo%29.gif?version=7b3d0e862a842f4e6d5de9104ee37784

plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:08:46 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 01:08:48 All Calamity mod
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:36 <@!587393222855229457> , do you REALLY need to DM me about that? It's "!servers"
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 03:23:40 Do it in <#384027830192832513>
creations-chat 2019-07-29 03:33:58 Why all the duplicates?
creations-chat 2019-07-29 03:58:44 Ah, understandable
help 2019-07-29 05:15:52 Only Rick can boot them, and he's offline
help 2019-07-29 05:15:59 Also if that really is you, so help me
help 2019-07-29 05:16:43 Fine, but if I get further reports about you, well you can guess what'll happen
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:36:50 If you check in <#478584971670454284> , you'll see that he referenced that account as an alt, however, like I said, black background, potential for editing
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:37:22 So can you check to see if it's consistent Noc?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:39:16 ............ I really don't know which side to take here
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:40:16 Ehhhh, Noc, verdict?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:41:31 Even though in <#478584971670454284> , he reported a person touting racist stuff?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:42:00 Welp, guess that determines the side then, <@!488404406350381067> , anything to add?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:43:00 ........ If it's a temper tantrum, you won't be let back on the server you know, and I can and will just wipe everything with ease
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 05:47:01 Hi
help 2019-07-29 06:08:29 Right, <@!600401420587368515> , <@!488404406350381067> , both of you, can it, and quit pointing fingers at eachother, you're both mixing things up and only showing things that make you look better, so I'm not taking either side, but I'm inclined against both of you because neither of you bothered to defend yourself outside of "I didn't do it"
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:29:50 If you can achieve a near-miss (Which I've found always happens), you'll actually be able to clip the enemy with the lava weapons
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:10 .... Who's server is it exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:16 Oh, I don't have it
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:30:47 Alright, let me see what I can do, I've been able to talk a couple of idiots out of self-arrest
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:04 DM it to me by the way
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:25 Excuse me while I just vanish
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:31:35 Hey, that's not all that we're good at you know
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:37:37 Can confirm, he deleted the main server, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:37:44 WAIT NONE OF YOU JOIN IT
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:35 Crazy, don't send it yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:40 Er, not here at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:39:42 I'll deal with it
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:40:11 I changed my name and PFP, without a Roblox verification system (Which I never opted into surprise surprise), I'd just show up as a different person
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:41:33 We're "raiding" him because he's <13, and tried to hide it in this server, while also causing a shitshow about it, but guys, just leave it to me
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:20 That one popped to, RIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:29 He said it in one of his own servers
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:42:51 Then I will freaking (metaphorically) hang you
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:44:48 Alright enough sneaking around and chasing that guy around
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:03 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:13 If Discord's going to club him, they're going to do it with the info I've extracted
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:45:43 And <@!396830889755017218> , for the love of damnnation, don't side with him, he's literally breaking laws by being 12 years old and using Discord
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:46:26 We would've left him be for whatever else happened if he didn't throw a hissy fit at one of our members while on the way out
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:46:38 And <@!311996873650995200> , don't worry about it, we aren't raiding
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:47:08 I just had to, with a lack of a better descriptor, surgically extract some info from a server
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:48:34 Ah, so someone leaked in that case
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:48:53 <@!396830889755017218> , **Ahem**
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:04 <@!396830889755017218> , Mhm, kindly tell him that the only reason I'm going after him is so he doesn't throw himself in his own hole of damnnation, and if he doesn't want to get permanently banned from Discord, as well as receive legal action, he'd do his best to apologize to those who he has offended, and leave Discord until he turns 13, about a year later
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:20 And to avoid repercussions, say it's from me, and that you're just passing the message along
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:51:33 .... I could **SEE** you're in the server Neeb
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:58:35 Posting NSFW as your very first thing while joining I guess
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 19:58:54 Hi Inferno
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:00:19 They save in a specific spot <@!260797229068058634> , so you can remove it if you know where to look
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:56:49 <@456226577798135808> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:57:51 Ah, I mean, fair, sorta? Not on the NSFW one, while it's not NSFW, it is disturbing, so I won't blast you for that, but I will say, don't do it again, but the avatar one's, sorta fair I guess? Let me see if there's other ways to do it though
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:58:17 It was a historical art piece of some guy peeling off his face, no inappropriate pieces showing, but he didn't have anything on
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:59:17 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 20:59:47 <@456226577798135808> I'll let you off with a verbal warn this time, but next time I'm going to beat you into a crater for that, got it?
plane-crazy 2019-07-29 21:00:46 ~~Okay that much is arguable but whatever~~ Hey
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:22:26 Can you both just stop?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:22:40 .............
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:11 <@!561734378758340649> , seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:26 Dude, seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:23:59 Pitch, pull the nose up, push the tail down
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:24:28 <@!561734378758340649> , can you please fucking cut it out? She's literally *asking* you to stop, and you keep on going
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:11 ... Katze, can you send proof that he's doing more?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:24 DMs
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:25:43 <@!561734378758340649> , **Any halfwit could tell that she's saying "thank you" to the cropping part, not to sending it**
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:00 Specifically this part ...
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:05 
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:27:36 Thank you, now can you please just leave her alone?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:28:47 It's actually fine, so don't worry
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:28:53 Er, the picture I meant
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:30:16 Just, try to keep calm Katze, and explain your goal to the other person
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:33:42 I've completely purged subs via guns actually
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:35:43 <@!182903471022931968> , experiment, that's all I can suggest, otherwise you'll never learn
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:36:06 And learning is how you develop your own unique style
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:20 The tinfoil scrap starter planes?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:35 Well I need one of those AAs then
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:37:48 Aren't they effective against you though?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:39:04 Or just boost the turret away
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:40:35 Evasion's easy, just stick a ton of turning jets or control panels on, hitting your target is harder though
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:41:29 How long does it take to do a full 360?
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:41:37 Mine's floaty style, so no Brick
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:42:50 Oh yeah, I think so? I'm not sure, memory's going bad because I'm very tired of everything
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:43:04 __***AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS***__
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:43:56 Spoilers: This is only the head, neck and shoulder part of it, and I say "head, neck and shoulder" instead of "nose and fuselage" for a reason
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:44:29 People keep on suggesting blender, but I've read that importing a custom mesh causes extreme lag
plane-crazy 2019-07-30 04:45:18 Also if you paid attention, you'll notice that not many parts actually overlap, so you don't have like 500 triangles per area
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 02:27:00 Yeah I'd say believe him for now
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:18:38 .............. <@!260544767446745088>
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:20:09 Technically Empire's an ex-mod, so he's *sorta* allowed to minimod I guess
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:10 <@!282987053317226498> **Ahem**
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:31 Let me just roll it out, it's NSFW, end of story
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:22:59 Okay shut up about it now I'm kicking them temporarily
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:23:49 Kick streak technically
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:23:57 God I'm fucking tired and stressed
bot-central 2019-08-01 23:24:31 The whole point is to wake them up that they're still in the server, if they rejoin with another NSFW PFP, then that means it's intentional
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:03:29 Fucking, <@!300089411486351360> , can you please explain why you're marked as <13 on Roblox?
plane-crazy 2019-08-03 23:03:46 We can get in legal trouble if we just leave you to linger around on Discord an you really are <13
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 02:57:53 **FINALLY** CST is free
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:51:23 It's made by Haggie, one of the few people who actually know how to do an interesting tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:52:57 Here's the link https://www.roblox.com/games/2620293110/Free-Cruise-Ship-Tycoon#!/game-instances
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:53:55 You do realize most of us have JUST started, and we don't exactly have shedloads of money to toss around, right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:54:21 Also honestly it looks good, but I'd suggest converting the top to the higher quality solar panels when possible
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:54:43 Well, "looks good", let's face it, the top's ugly as sin, but that's for gameplay purposes, so handwave that
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:55:51 Actually have freedom to do stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:56:02 Just give it a shot, it's free
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:56:51 Yeup
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:57:15 It's retail tycoon with like 10 extra layers of density ontop
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 03:58:11 Can't donate sadly
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:01:13 I'm going for functionality first, once I get  enough money to go crazy, I'm gonna start aesthetically designing again
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:04:55 Buy bigger ships or knock down some walls
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:18:43 Imperial, batteries are actually potentially faster than generators
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:18:59 Generators take up 2X5, 10 slots, batteries take up 1X2, 2 slots (duh)
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:19:12 Each battery gives 500 units, each generator gives 1500
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 04:19:16 Do the math
general 2019-08-05 16:36:46 <@!429665143677255681> Seriously?
general 2019-08-05 16:36:59 God fucking, I **JUST** woke up and I see that
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:23:51 **Solar power**
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:20 Because my problem is surface space
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:36 **The problem is** __**SURFACE SPACE**__
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:47 Cruise Ship Tycoon
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:49 It's a Haggie game
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:24:55 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 21:25:04 It's a game literally about sailing cruise ships
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:04 ?ban 575350704034807848 Preemptive ban due to mass pings just for trolling in another server
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:20 .... SHUT UP I'M TIRED AND SICK OF EVERYTHING
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:33 ?ping
plane-crazy 2019-08-07 23:07:36 .... Dyno why?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:15 Really guys?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:23 ............ **GUYS**
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:34:43 That's it, slow mode's going on until you all calm down
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:17 It's just, a, **PING** for crud's sake, plus it was an accident
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:21 .... Rick pinged
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:35:54 Wait was that the right one I swear
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:09 Fucking hell, CAN YOU ALL JUST CALM THE HELL DOWN FOR A MOMENT!?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:27 Yes I got the right one, good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:36:57 It was an accidental ping from Rick
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:37:11 Now can you all calm down so I can happily turn off slowmode so I don't have a seizure from the sheer chaos?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:37:37 Dev, you're free to leave if you want, nobody's stopping you
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:38:42 <@232694074501496833> , It was an accident, now can you calm down about it so I can turn off slowmode?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:02 Decreasing slowmode now
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:14 If you guys can behave yourselves, I'll remove it altogether
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:39:26 Rick made an accidental ping
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:15 <@456226577798135808> , Right, let's make this clear, people <13 are legally not allowed to be on Discord, and we can get in trouble if we leave you on the server, so Dev Evan aside (Who was <13), are you 13 years or older? If not, please leave
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:40 Salak, it was an accidental ping from Rick
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:46 Okay okay okay no need to show proof you're good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:40:53 Dev, you're good
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:21 Yes, Dev Evan was underaged to use Discord
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:36 Right, I'm turning off slowmode, since you guys seem to have gotten everything back together again
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:42:46 Enrico, check <#490306593242611742> for why
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:43:43 Superidra, we found evidence of the old Evan (Not the one that just arrived) being under 13 years old, and he went super defensive and immature about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:06 **RIGHT, GUYS, RICK MADE AN ACCIDENTAL PING, CHECK <#490306593242611742> ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT MORE INFO**
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:10 
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:26 I'm tired of being a freaking broken record and just going "Rick made an accidental ping" over and over again
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:45 Yeup, I believe so
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:52 Check the pings Raty
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:44:58 Er, pins, not pings
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:45:08 Raty, check the pins
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:45:30 Tesla, you're fine, we're already sure you're allowed to be on here
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 17:47:37 It's not too chaotic, so I don't think slowmode's needed
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 15:18:39 <@!238017332872478720> , check <#490306593242611742> for why
general 2019-09-15 19:01:48 How the hell am I supposed to remember what I banned people for? I used to do it all the time for people being assholes generally
general 2019-09-15 19:01:54 Plus read the announcement ...
general 2019-09-15 19:04:10 Still dying here, although alot less definitely
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:00:22 <@!252094891448860673> , what the heck happened to inventor exactly? (I'm getting bothered by people asking how to get inventor)
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:01:21 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 21:02:14 Well again, people are bugging me about it, "how do you get inventor" and such, hence why I'm popping back on to ask about it, since I noticed it isn't in the ranks anymore
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:46:26 What's going on exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:01 Retracting that
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:16 MrEpic, next time be nice, if there's a next time ......
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:47:51 There, now seeya, that shit's not okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:48:26 I'm retired from being a mod, but I came back on to see, that ...
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:48:43 **Don't fight fire with fire, you'll just burn yourself even worse**
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:49:11 Next time, __**IF**__ there's a next time, let one of the mods handle it
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:50:46 One last thing before I go by the way, MrEpic, that stuff isn't okay, at all ... nothing, even as a joke, **aside from mentioning it is happening to someone that can stop it**, will justify saying that word
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:51:35 Oh? Do tell joey (Don't actually)
plane-crazy 2019-10-12 22:52:46 Back to still trying to recover, I am **very** glad I bailed off when I could, seeya guys
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:15:16 It was an alt of someone
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:15:32 Personal request with evidence incase you're all wondering
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 18:16:02 Thanks, back to being dead (Irl stuff and said alt making everything miserable again)
general 2020-01-17 22:26:48 It stopped being a joking matter about 4-5 days ago you bunch, can you please cut it out
general 2020-01-17 22:27:39 Nearly wasn't honestly, I'll try chiming in every so often, but do note: IRL things take priority, especially after that event, okay? If any of you caught what my status was, you'll know what happened
general 2020-02-26 19:32:02 You forgot to mention the ~30 times I've blasted you as well before someone got a bug on me Robo
general 2020-02-26 19:37:09 As powerful as you get, even aimbots in that game are mortal you know, unless they hack health as well, but that's another story (Yes I have found both with alarming frequency)
general 2020-02-26 19:38:07 If you're wondering why I say people hack health, frag grenade, does 150 damage (you have 150 health in the game), I hit a cluster of guys camping our spawn, 4 fall over like they should, 1 continues peppering away, I do it again, he's still standing
general 2020-02-26 19:42:33 Yeah if anyone noticed my rants on Bad Business there's a reason I do them so often (Freaking 10X firerate on a shotgun [~100 RPM vs 1K RPM]), also I'm starting to come back to life bit by bit, which is good I suppose
general 2020-02-26 19:43:22 I have a video of someone doing a firerate and wall hack with the AK if anyone's interested
general 2020-02-26 19:44:49 It's the Rudimentality FPS
general 2020-02-26 19:48:17 Yeah, I'll try to be more active and less dead, but no guarantees
general 2020-02-26 19:49:48 **HAHAHAHAHAAAHHHHH**, aboouuuut all of those (minus votekick-avoiders, they just ignore the votekick system because nobody even bothers with it)
general 2020-02-26 19:55:40 Every single prestiege 3 in BB I've found that uses semi-autos uses them at a consistent rate, and only uses semi-autos rather than anything automatic, even when challenged
People keep on parking on the top walls of canal thinking nobody's going to notice, even though they're literally designed so you can't get up there, ever
Already mentioned aimbots
And people pre-aim through cover, multiple times, and I've intentionally cut my connection very briefly to see if they still keep track of me after I move to another piece of cover or even behind them with what's basically teleporting (spoilers: They do)
People modify damage, I'm still seeing instances of insta-kill shotguns
RoF is being hacked to hell and back (Again, video of that)
Health's modified (See how I fragged a guy twice and he still kept on running through it, both times with a confirmed hitmarker)
And even hitboxes are tweaked sometimes (Back before stick nades were nerfed, some random nutjob was running around knifing everyone, I hit two nades, one at his feet, one actually catching me in the radius as he was trying to knife me, neither even registered as a hit)

And that's what I kept on witnessing for QUITE a while
general 2020-02-26 19:56:01 Just listing out what I've seen on there
general 2020-02-26 19:56:10 TL;DR: Lots of hacks of all kinds you can imagine
general 2020-02-26 19:57:06 Also, can someone tell me how a gun emptying it's ~20 round mag instantly is "skill"?
general 2020-02-26 19:57:31 And I mean in a literal singular frame, not very rapid like the Vector in-game does
general 2020-02-26 19:57:56 That's the most recent one that rubbed me off wrong before I joined your server Robo
general 2020-02-26 19:58:54 Bad Business, some guy was using the G36 (I think it has 24 rounds last time I checked), and he shot it like a god fucking damn shotgun, even though the kill reading clearly showed a G36
general 2020-02-26 19:59:41 As you might imagine, before I left I saw him leading by quite the severe margin on the leaderboard
general 2020-02-26 20:00:34 
general 2020-02-26 20:01:10 Kip, be prepared for suspicious things if you do
general 2020-02-26 20:01:31 Like I said, exploiter central ... either that or I'm a god fucking damn magnet for them
general 2020-02-26 20:02:47 I swear the two that I told you about in the server were hacking Robo, one of them survived 7 headshots from the Vector (Let me just grab another screenshot of how much damage it does), while the other just snapped to me every time I hit them, like a literal 90 degree snap to my head
general 2020-02-26 20:03:39 
general 2020-02-26 20:04:12 150 health, they shouldn't be able to survive 4 headshots, let alone **7**
general 2020-02-26 20:04:16 Yeah
general 2020-02-26 20:09:02 Probably would go in <#384021699466756107> but for the sake of consistency, did you actually save it, or did it simply vanish
general 2020-02-26 20:10:37 Did you save it all into the same spot, accidentally load instead, or what?
general 2020-02-26 20:11:46 Hmmmm, weird
general 2020-02-26 20:19:54 Uhhhhh, seriously?
general 2020-06-10 15:37:04 Yello
general 2020-08-12 02:49:31 By technicality you need to have 1 upvote and downvote automatically, so it balances out
general 2020-08-12 02:52:33 Hey <@!314383347214319616> , can we get a flyswatter for this guy?
general 2020-08-12 02:52:38 
general 2020-08-12 02:52:54 Yes I wrote a note about him, it was entirely out of the blue as well
general 2020-08-12 02:53:16 Just randomly sent a friend request, so that little "conversation" happened, and, well you see the rest
general 2020-08-12 02:56:07 The main reason I had to ask for his age was because under 13, you're not allowed to be on Discord, and his way of typing was an immediate red flag of that
general 2020-08-12 02:57:02 I'm coming back, not 100% back yet, my arms are fucking murdered and my general health's gone to shit, but I'm coming back gradually
general 2020-08-12 02:57:50 Why you indeed have my good friend Oil Drilling
general 2020-08-12 02:58:04 Also **faahhhk's sake with the dragon chairs**
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:58:49 He could've at least made it reasonable
general 2020-08-12 02:59:22 Long story short me and Bobby met on a different server, he's a nice guy, if only he wouldn't keep on turning dragons into chairs god damn it (It's a running joke between me and a few Rimworld friends)
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:27 Okay lag bombing is infact bannable I believe, clock a video or screenshot of a lag machine and post it here?
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:01:03 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:01:51 Freaking little attention seeking shits honestly, like seriously
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:06:49 It's meta-building for maximal annoyance, if you remember the days of the noob cubes, those things are incredibly maneuverable, for very little effort, and were incredibly annoying to hit
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:07:37 Basically a small cube purely designed to beat people in PVP and avoid getting hit entirely by any form of attack
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:08:52 To be fair votekicks are easy to abuse, and I've seen many games where it's been either abused, or useless
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:09:27 Darmagon, trust me when I say alts, like-minded idiots and so on can easily nullify a votekick system
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:09:36 And this is Roblox you're talking about
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:10:51 I've had it happen to me in other games, where people accuse me of hacking, of "bullying" or so on, and they try to votekick me, and I get it often enough that I know a VK system won't work, especially in Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-16 03:22:52 <@!304977711988867072> , potential scammer, life took a shit on me a few minutes ago, again, I, can't be assed to follow protocol right now, sorry, also hi it's been a while
general 2020-08-16 03:23:21 Sorry about coming out of the blue and reporting this but I really can not be assed right now
general 2020-08-16 03:24:29 Parent has Parkinson's Disease psychosis, a very bad one, and just today I found out that people who I thought understood what I was going through were infact against me
general 2020-08-16 03:24:43 I, just want to be left alone in all honesty, I really just want to be left alone
general 2020-09-17 22:46:35 Got a scam bot here
general 2020-09-17 22:46:45 Did a quick Google search and it's a "free robux" scam site
general 2020-09-17 22:47:13 I'm recovering, but not fully yet
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 02:43:57 The number is how many mines are adjacent to that block
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 02:44:18 Diagonals included
general 2021-01-23 05:13:44 __***-Siiiigh-***__, why am I here again?
general 2021-01-23 05:14:29 More like they randomly DMed me and acted like an utter idiot about it
general 2021-01-25 01:12:25 Yes?
general 2021-01-25 01:13:01 Miserable, I'm glad I left when I did for a few reasons, primarily because my health and attitude have worsened
general 2021-01-25 01:13:33 And yes very long story short my status is tied to said thing ruining my general health
general 2021-01-25 01:16:44 I've always had Discord up, just that I generally don't pay attention to this server cause *it's hecking busy* all the time, which is a given with 16K people
general 2021-01-25 01:17:33 To be exact,
general 2021-01-25 01:21:43 Generally inventing means something entirely new in Plane Crazy which has some use outside of looking fancy
general 2021-01-25 01:22:09 The goal post for inventor has been pushed further and further as people invented more things with more uses and so on
general 2021-01-25 01:22:20 Completely halted, I have no inspiration anymore
general 2021-01-25 01:22:40 Well, it's moreso motivation and the ability to move it onto the Roblox system, but still
general 2021-01-25 01:23:34 I know right? Just, nothing but bots upvoting themselves and so on, also we should probably bump to DMs at this point
general 2021-03-29 23:19:32 I'm alive, TL;DR on what happened in the past: Nerves got damaged from stress, I was able to compensate for it though
general 2021-03-29 23:19:42 More or less I'm normal again
general 2021-03-29 23:24:34 Very long story short I'm an ex-mod on the server
general 2021-03-29 23:30:36 Orange's account is definitely deleted, so there's that
general 2021-06-01 03:23:00 Having to deal with someone who has PD psychosis, as well as a narcissistic dictator of a person, neither of whom I can get away from nor send away for various reasons
general 2021-06-03 22:19:46 I literally saw someone doing this on another game, except they were using it as a hack rather than a glitch, and they did it so only their head had collision
general 2021-06-14 00:23:23 By pure technicality, yes, but do I associate myself as one? No
It's really more of a slider, but if you want an on/off yes/no answer, then by pure technicality I should say yes
general 2021-06-14 00:25:29 Again, by technicality
general 2021-06-14 00:28:01 That's why I don't associate with them, they range from "literally saved me from a heart attack" to "the worst kind of scum on earth", just that people seem to focus on the latter
Though that's all people in general, so **don't** just stick a label on them
general 2021-06-14 00:33:36 Again, just don't forget there's good and bad
Recent example for a positive for me was again, that "saved me from a heart attack" guy, he fursuits, but he gave me advice when it happened, and I managed to get it under control
Recent example for a negative interaction was a guy who was genuinely a manipulative, unstable asshole who was a definite furry

Soooo, really they just act like people in a way, there's good and there's bad
general 2021-06-14 00:37:23 To be blunt, it's nothing special, but that's not to say it's bad, infact considering the Roblox average, it's quite good
general 2021-06-14 00:41:59 *And don't forget, that's coming from a (by pure technicality) furry*

Okay but seriously though that's probably just Roblox as a side effect, or the two doubling up, the community is *really* crap sometimes, and I should know considering one guy threatened to come to my house over a game
general 2021-06-14 00:43:13 Ehh, I haven't been here in a long while, ex-mod due to health issues
general 2021-06-14 00:47:01 And why not exactly?
general 2021-06-14 00:49:07 Fully conscious of that, I just glance over every so often
general 2021-06-19 20:53:57 <@!673397945764151336> , we've got a phishing account here, probably one that's DMing and scamming kids
general 2021-06-19 20:55:06 Yeah well explain why they couldn't respond at all?
general 2021-06-19 20:55:18 Exactly this
general 2021-06-19 20:55:51 It's why if the person acts suspicious, and/or has no explanation for their invites, it's likely a bot attempting to scam
general 2021-06-19 20:55:57 They haven't verified so they won't be able to chat in here
general 2021-06-19 20:56:39 And the fact that they joined, haven't verified, have a generic car image instead of anything original, then just randomly messaged someone without giving an explanation, is a multitude of signs of a phishing account
general 2021-06-19 20:57:11 Most of the time they get nothing, but sometimes they hit a particularly gullible idiot, or one with all their eggs in one basket, and they get a jackpot
But 99.9% of the time they're bullshit
general 2021-07-02 00:19:14 Easy solution: If you aren't Leon, show a few builds off
general 2021-07-02 00:19:27 People of a certain standard of quality have a general design theme
general 2021-07-02 00:19:59 Think of it like a fingerprint, with enough creations, you can genuinely tell who's who just by their designs
general 2021-07-02 00:20:05 Then, *why* are you in the server?
general 2021-07-02 00:20:25 Well to be fair I don't anymore either though I at least had a fingerprint in the past
general 2021-07-02 00:21:49 People get freaked out by you asking for rule breaking stuff, they let us know, you get potentially arrested for pedophilia
general 2021-07-04 05:52:50 Very long story short my entire extended family told me to fuck off after I saved one of my parents by preventing them from catching their sleeve on fire and burning
general 2021-07-04 05:53:25 That's the kind of bullshit I have to deal with **day to day**, I just don't tout the bullshit all the time
general 2021-07-04 05:54:08 I was fucking asked what was going on so can you politely fuck off with that, and if that sounds rude then too bad I'm not in the mood to be nice
general 2021-07-04 05:54:43 Blame Nephius for asking me if you're going to blame anyone, now stick a fork in it and pretend I don't exist
general 2021-07-04 05:55:24 Primary reason it's disabled for anyone under Mee6 I'd imagine is because <#384025409945337856> kept on getting flooded by people randomly dropping by then immediately leaving
general 2021-08-28 06:18:40 The fuck are you two doing?
general 2021-08-28 06:21:29 They're being a pair of dumbasses trying to ping everyone for needless attention, not realizing they pissed someone off who they really didn't want to piss off
general 2021-08-28 06:22:19 Kid, I'm going to do something, __***alot worse***__ than ban you if you don't say "okay", then fuck off for the rest of the day
general 2021-08-28 06:23:16 I'd just slug em with a ban, clear malicious intent with a behavioral pattern that doesn't seem indicative of any capacity of learning
general 2021-09-20 02:05:08 I can verify he chatted a while ago
general 2021-09-20 02:05:40 I'm not commenting on the rest until I read up a bit further, but I will say he's at least truthful enough on that
general 2021-09-20 02:06:23 This statement I have issue with though
general 2021-09-20 02:06:59 Now quit trying to advertise so aggressively and just enjoy it, if people want Plane Crazy content they'll look you up
general 2021-09-20 02:08:07 It's called the search function, it's called verifying what you said to get an idea of your character
general 2021-09-20 02:08:50 Forgive me for being as blunt as a hammer, but you haven't even been here for *one* year
general 2021-09-20 02:09:41 That wasn't directed at you, that was directed at earthop
And if I seem deathly serious, I'm just eternally stuck as that after being shoved through the meat grinder hell of having to deal with psychotic patients
general 2021-09-20 02:10:06 And if you don't normally lie, ***prove it***, you've given ample evidence of the opposite
general 2021-09-20 02:10:53 And no you can't prove it right now, prove it over time with truthful, verifiable statements, and honest behavior
general 2021-09-20 02:11:21 These are logs you can check yourself by the way, and if you aren't certain on something, always make sure to mention that you aren't certain
general 2021-09-20 02:12:20 And finally, I know I already mentioned this, but just for extra emphasis: Don't advertise so aggressively Chunk, people will look up your channel if they're interested in Plane Crazy stuff, so don't just shove it into their faces
general 2021-09-20 02:13:37 That much isn't provable without causing issues
You might not know what to block out, and that can cause serious issues
general 2021-09-20 02:15:08 TL;DR: People can find out all kinds of things about a person with with only a bit of information beforehand
general 2021-09-20 02:15:23 You don't without getting into ToS issues
general 2021-09-20 02:15:39 And ToS issues go above our particular server
general 2021-09-20 02:15:53 So my advice: __***Don't***__
general 2021-09-20 02:17:23 And I've been able to serve people actual monetary fines for less, now ***KNOCK IT OFF***, nobody likes a freakshow trying to show traumatizing images everywhere
general 2021-09-20 02:18:07 Terms of Service, it's a legal document you need to agree to in order to use the service, and violating it can lead to discontinued service for you, or worse if you attempt to repeatedly use it after getting your plug pulled
general 2021-09-20 02:18:34 By the way I am horribly oversimplifying it but in the broadest strokes it's this
general 2021-09-20 02:19:45 It's fine, just don't pair that to boost your channel or whatever
general 2021-09-20 02:20:20 What did I literally say about facing potential legal fines for this? Nobody likes it anyways
general 2021-09-20 02:22:04 I can also see you were already booted from the server by the way
general 2021-09-20 02:30:37 What are you specifically asking about rick?
general 2021-09-26 21:46:40 __***FOR ANYONE CLICKING ON IT LEAVE THE SITE IMMEDIATELY, IT'S A SCAM***__
general 2021-09-26 21:46:46 <@!577280189109633025> , exit it immediately it's a scam
general 2021-09-26 21:47:17 Good, make sure you don't fall for it
general 2021-09-26 21:47:31 Hi vixo
general 2021-09-26 21:47:54 Dying, almost literally through blood pressure
general 2021-09-26 21:49:07 As much as that's excessive Sub, you're right in principle, there's multiple viruses whcih can happen just on loading
general 2021-09-26 21:49:51 Probably because a crapton of idiots/dinglenuts/whatever the hell else swarm them for relatively minor things, it's **Roblox** after all, the community's literally legendarily crap
general 2021-09-26 21:50:04 <@!603974932585644043> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/891802453857665035
general 2021-09-26 21:50:30 It's a very common scam targeting kids or less vigilant people
general 2021-09-26 21:51:07 Uhhhh, hang on a sec, <@456226577798135808> are you actually a kid?
general 2021-09-26 21:53:24 That's an issue then, Discord Terms of Service requires you to be at least 13 years old to remain in the server, and the server as a *whole* can get in trouble if we ignore this
general 2021-09-26 21:53:56 One or two, sure, but if we just ignore it then it becomes a major problem
general 2021-09-26 21:54:29 No I'm just the guy who looks up the legal bullcrud in the Terms of Service to cover every avenue
general 2021-09-26 21:55:11 Terraria Calamity mod's current end-game boss
