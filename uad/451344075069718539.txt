general 2023-02-25 22:41:14 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-02-25 22:41:51 already did
general 2023-02-25 22:42:01 just waiting for them to respond
general 2023-02-25 22:55:58 why can't we just remove that thing
general 2023-02-25 22:56:14 the problems with mov files were fixed well over a year ago
general 2023-02-25 23:22:36 finally gonna leave this place after I get my main back after this shit
general 2023-02-25 23:58:46 you don't unless you want to get warned
general 2023-02-26 22:41:15 kinda fishy how they're not being specific
general 2023-02-26 22:42:38 watch it be some easily disproven shit instead of the actual shit you know they could've nuked my main for ‚ò†Ô∏è
general 2023-02-27 02:58:02 <@1079374868061114501> so uh we had the exact same shit happen to each other at the exact same time

general 2023-02-27 03:42:39 unless it's a server crasher
general 2023-02-27 03:42:58 false
general 2023-02-27 03:43:43 the ragebaby who made the pc competitor that we can't say the name of was banned from pc for getting caught with a server crasher
general 2023-02-27 03:45:07 still an actual build and not a lag machine
general 2023-02-27 03:45:26 if laggy builds were against the rules every expert would probably be screwed
