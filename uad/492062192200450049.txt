help 2020-07-10 21:32:04 <@!400465835845615616> so how would i build a thruster on it
help 2020-07-10 22:32:10 <@!400465835845615616> thank you for the help, i tinkered with the size because attempting a ducted fan would make the lift too light
help 2020-07-10 22:35:30 now i need a way to stabilize it, as it wobbles up and down during flight
help 2020-07-10 22:57:41 any ideas how to stabilize?

help 2020-07-10 23:06:29 alright.
help 2020-07-10 23:06:38 ill replace the current one with a 1x4 wedge tail
help 2020-07-10 23:09:51 <@!508065143905845248> bumped into a problem, if i do any longer tail, it will weigh it down even more
help 2020-07-10 23:15:55 ballasts don't help really.
help 2020-07-10 23:31:48 <@!299289130964090881> what should i do to stabilize the heli?
help 2020-07-10 23:32:01 the 1x4 wedge tail doesn't help out that much
help 2020-07-10 23:32:37 i use a 1x2 wedge tail and it works fine
help 2020-07-10 23:32:42 its just the wobble thing
help 2020-07-10 23:32:46 alright.

help 2020-07-11 01:18:32 + i need a viable way of making this move foward.
help 2020-07-11 01:28:29 used ballasts to weigh the front down ,that works in the foward part
help 2020-07-11 01:36:07 <@!508065143905845248> actually sorry i was wrong, the front was probably the main problem, so i added ballasts
help 2020-07-11 01:38:02 however what would be the best way to make it hover in the air?
help 2020-07-11 01:38:03 <@!508065143905845248>

creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:50:03 imo my build is kinda sucky but ah well, might try some other stuff later
creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:53:45 oh ya tbh, any criticism about that plane i made earlier?
looking foward to improve designs and such
creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:56:23 eh, limitations from the grid apply plus i was focused on making it small-ish
either way it functions fine enough, i guess
general 2021-12-01 13:59:06 me watching my creation get to a negative dislike ratio <:pog:733634235851866133>
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:00:11 question, how do motor locks even work for building designs, most of the time when i smack a missile into them they just implode onto themselves
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:03:07 what plane should i design next thats probably going to get a 1:10 dislike ratio?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:04:22 what plane should i design next
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:04:35 besides the one that probably looks like that lego toy plane ripoff
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:04:42 
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:04:58 was a attempt at that btd6 flag carriership plane but kinda turned out bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:05:05 may do more biplane ideas?
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:06:15 not saying its bad or anything but that wing is cursed in my terms
response to below: ya, go for it i guess
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:15:32 question, should i scrap this plane design and go for a newer one thats far more accurate or just go for a different design entirely
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:16:32 although less accurate, i'll do that once i figure out a design that prevents yellow bars from sticking out entirely
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:17:02 since the yellow is intruding out therefore making it worse in looks
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:17:17 jeez my dislike ratio on that plane is wilding
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:18:33 can you give me a idea on what to design next real quick
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:19:03 kinda a beginner at the building stuff, but i know some "aerodynamics" and such
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:19:16 hence the plane looking like that offbrand lego btd6 set
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:19:57 "Mom found the Mig-31 hole"
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:20:46 this? <@!719168864705052802>
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:21:04 does it require any motorlocking black magic stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:22:06 wait whats anglelocking again?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:22:26 i was assuming that for the start
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:22:33 can you teach me the ways of that black magic stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:24:51 this how it works?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:26:02 ya you can demonstrate better
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:26:09 just drop a vip link
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:26:11 alright
bot-central 2021-12-01 14:26:18 -servers
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:54:53 kinda just scrapped the btd6 plane stuff, this is moreso of a custom design now and doesn't look as bulky anymore
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 14:59:59 made the plane not look like a ripped up toy plane finally, only have to fix up the guns and possibly make it where top wing doesn't just hover over now
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:08:41 tell me if this is half-decent or still bad like the one i posted in creations
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:09:34 what did i leave unpainted?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:09:45 if your talking about the engines, then thats intentiona-
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:10:18 new design:
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:10:23 hold on

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:10:43 old design <@!441939688018935818>
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:11:20 jeez the difference is really noticable
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:12:05 ya that really sucked after someone pointed it out
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:12:12 literally just cheese slammed into the wings as support
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:13:14 LMFAO
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:13:34 WAIT DID YOU SERIOUSLY TAKE THE TIME AND EFFORT
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:13:35 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:13:54 seriously though new design got way better than the slammed cheese bar plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:14:49 hold on is it against creation guidelines if i repost the same plane with a few edits to not make it cheese block plane?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:15:33 true, as its literally just a edit
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:18:28 final result of the edit
pilot can see, no janky blocks connecting and such
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:20:09 final result
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:20:22 now its kinda mediocore for a beginner build
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:20:41 OH NO I JUST REALIZED
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:20:46 THE WING PATTERNS ARE UPVOTES
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:26:26 Thank you for the score kind Stranger
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:31:05 what are tuts
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:31:34 shredder bugs:
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:31:46 might be done with the entire edit
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:32:25 the <:Upvote:490311647492309004> plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:32:26 idk
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:47:51 any feedback on the thing i redid earlier so its not 4 cheese blocks holding it up?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:49:40 tut planes be like "it works doe"
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:50:26 i watched a few tutorials on the tank track stuff but those were kinda complex and performance heavy for a build i wanted to do
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 15:51:03 actually how do you make thrust vectoring?
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 21:04:35 weak spot are the exposed motors yadada
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:34:29 i have no idea on gas types but hmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:34:52 if it was a normal planet with a thick atmosphere, maybe high amounts of iron with uranium freckles?
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:35:15 oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 02:35:19 your talking about building, sorry
