creations-chat 2018-11-30 05:16:50 Haven't colored it yet. But this is something cool a made a day or two ago.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 05:17:20 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 05:38:42 Awesome.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 05:39:44 Jeez
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 05:42:12 Mine is special, I think. XD
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:40:59 Hovercraft | 1667 Blocks
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:41:37 Oh ok.

creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:44:16 The inside.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:48:17 Pretty well. The only thing is landing it. XD
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:48:33 Other than landing it is really smooth.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:48 üëå
creations-chat 2018-11-30 06:49:56 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-30 15:31:05 I experimented with basically everything except for PVP stuff on my first day. I love building mechanical things. Awesome AT-AT btw.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:13:27 Good luck.

plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:16:04 I'm always on Discord but I am trash at helping people. Lol.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:17:28 Today is a great day.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:17:35 Friday, always on the grind.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:18:22 That makes me happyn't
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:22:17 What if 3.333 people are chosen?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:22:55 That's not a 3rd of someone.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:23:08 He is predicted that.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:23:14 It may be more or less.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:23:42 A third of someone would be like their arms maybe.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:25:17 Nice.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:29:28 Would just empty space be super aerodynamic or not aerodynamic at all?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:30:25 :o
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:31:41 Is there any way to change what roblox account your discord is linked to through the bot?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:32:39 Since it automatically set it to an account I used a while ago but don't really use anymore.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:32:54 Since I have joined server that have that bot.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:33:06 I use Cryptic_Banks now.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:33:19 K.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:33:32 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:34:14 Just don't want to bug anyone. It's really not that big of an issue.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:34:28 It doesn't effect anything.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:34:56 Nice.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 17:37:49 I don't understand the thrust sometimes in this game though. I built two aircraft (relatively the same size) and I had to put like 25-30 super rocket engines to reach the same speed as the other that uses only like 10.

creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:39:36 Awesome.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 18:40:26 Just send a pic.

Thrusters can be used. You just have to counter the force with another thruster. That's how I made the effect on my hovercraft plane thing.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:25:27 How so?
the-dump 2018-11-30 21:29:24 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:18 My plane?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:43 I haven't posted a plane here in a while.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:30:45 Lol.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:31:04 I haven't even attempted it yet.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:31:37 My largest build was able to fit in the build zone so I haven't needed it.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:32:27 Oh.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:32:36 You can probably do a piston lock.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:33:53 Just make a piston push a block or two at the point where it starts to swing open.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:12 So it can't swing open.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:35 Idk.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:34:56 I use it to keep my plane's cargo door from swinging down.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:35:15 Pretty simple.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:36:26 I started playing like this week I think. But I have experimented a lot.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:36:37 Lol
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:37:30 Awesome.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:37:42 The first large scale build was a submarine.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:38:01 About a 1000 blocks I believe.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:38:20 Not too big. But big for my standards at the time. üòÇ
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:39:01 Yeah underwater is so hard to move with submarines.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:40:52 Wow.
creations-chat 2018-11-30 21:41:11 My biggest build currently is 1660 something blocks.

general 2018-11-30 21:46:23 !rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:09:56 I tried making a magnet power plane. üòõ
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:09:59 Failed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:10:08 But it I learned a lot. Lol.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:10:10 How?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:10:26 You can literally only go one direction.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:10:44 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:10:58 But you will constantly go in one direction.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:11:03 Even if you add turning.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:11:09 Using thrusters and stuff.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:11:57 Cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:12:41 Famous. .-.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:18:23 Yeah even toggling the magnets off doesn't make the movement stop.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:22:13 There is no way to stop a magnet powered machine. XD
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 03:22:20 It just keeps going.
bug-reports 2018-12-02 03:28:46 Not sure if this is a bug or something I a doing wrong, or maybe it was intentional who knows? But when using magnets, the toggle doesn't really seem to work. Could be a range thing however. When I repel the magnets (My settings: Max Range, Max Strength, Toggle On, Magnets Only, Weld On) and weigh one down so it doesn't fly off the other just doesn't stop when I toggle it off. It continues in that direction forever. Even if you block it, once the obstacle is removed it will continue fly off.

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:54:12 I have yet to use springs or suspension for anything. .-.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:54:25 I need to experiment with them a bit.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:54:33 Bye.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 05:55:30 Idk.
help 2018-12-03 06:18:50 Just work like one
help 2018-12-03 06:19:46 Or turn off RGB
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:20:14 Same.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:21:40 Well you get credit in the satisfaction you feel when people compliment it. Knowing all the work you put into it. :)
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:24:29 There are only a few ranks that I would never settle not getting if I did the work and didn't get the rank. Those would be like the Elon Musk rank and the Lightspeed rank.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:24:52 Everything else is meh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:25:21 Sometimes the builds go unnoticed by the mods.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:26:12 I wouldn't say they are unfairly picked. There is probably some reason why he has mod. .-.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:26:19 Well trial mod.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:27:23 I spend a decent amount of time here, not talking but watching from the shadows. üòÇ
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:28:26 <:F_:518826166249979936>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:29:09 I don't think it's that big of a deal honestly.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:29:20 He isn't an actual mod yet.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:29:31 So he has time to gain ranks.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:30:11 *Watching from the shadows*
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:30:42 Unless you spend days working up speed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:34:06 <@468207489524039680> Using magnets is the way to go. Helium is overrated.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:34:37 I'm working on it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:34:46 My magnet thing goes like 30k a second.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:34:49 Lmao.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:39:04 Idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:39:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:39:53 Nah.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:39:58 Just lightspeed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:40:00 It is top.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:41:06 Just aim for easy ranks.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:41:24 There a quite a few ranks are that pretty easy to get.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:41:53 Or Novice Engineer.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:43:41 Another super easy rank is Ensign.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:43:52 Dang
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:44:39 *I'm just going to creep back into the shadows...*
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:45:57 Against the qualifications he means..
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:39 He is using the wrong wording.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:46:47 Not rigged but unfair.
general 2018-12-03 06:47:19 Awesome.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 06:47:32 ...
creations-chat 2018-12-03 06:47:39 Why did you send it as a file?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:48:47 Then why does it matter?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:50:17 No one has a problem with it because Jailbreak is still a trial mod. And he is actually putting in effort to gain ranks so that he can meet to qualifications so that it isn't against the qualifications.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:50:43 üëç
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:51:45 Oh damn

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:56:16 Oh yeah. Not to both you mods, but since you guys are online would it be possible to change my nickname to my current Roblox account (this one automatically set because the bot has been used for other Roblox servers I was in a while ago).
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:56:38 Cryptic_Banks

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:24:58 You need Lua
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:24:59 To develop roblox games.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:25:00 You need Lua
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:25:39 But what is your problem with the ballast block?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:26:24 It depends on what you are using it with and how many you use.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:27:17 Hmm..
