The Tale of twicedaice (345034747329642496)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:06:54 are there any new update plans for a larger plot space
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:06:56 like a premium plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:07:05 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:07:16 what about touching moving parts
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:13 like
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:20 having blocks attached to a motor
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:26 that also make contact with parts not attached to it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:39 if you do this now the motor gets stuck
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:44 maybe like
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:08:47 a paint type of slick
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:09:04 where it wont stick to parts that dont move comparatively
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:11:41 id send a picture
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:11:43 but i cant
help 2021-04-14 00:07:49 i created a thing
help 2021-04-14 00:07:53 it uses a motor2
help 2021-04-14 00:08:02 i set it to rotate 180 degrees
help 2021-04-14 00:08:04 but no matter what i do
help 2021-04-14 00:08:09 it rotate the wrong direction
help 2021-04-14 00:08:23 pressing forwards and backwards doesnt change its direction
help 2021-04-14 00:08:33 rotating the motor doesnt either
help 2021-04-14 00:08:37 how do i fix this
help 2021-04-14 00:09:09 fold
help 2021-04-14 00:09:12 yes
help 2021-04-14 00:09:14 its in servo mode
help 2021-04-14 00:09:36 backward f forward r
help 2021-04-14 00:09:37 speed 1
help 2021-04-14 00:09:41 maxtourque 1000
help 2021-04-14 00:09:44 maxangle 180
help 2021-04-14 00:09:48 servo and toggle are both on
help 2021-04-14 00:09:54 inverted is off
help 2021-04-14 00:09:59 ive already tried it
help 2021-04-14 00:10:22 i was thinking about that
help 2021-04-14 00:10:50 sure enough
help 2021-04-14 00:10:52 it works just fine
help 2021-04-14 00:11:00 even if its still not 180
help 2021-04-14 00:11:31 maybe
help 2021-04-14 00:11:45 there should def be an option to change the direction it tries to move in though
help 2021-04-14 00:12:08 still gonna be quite annoying
help 2021-04-14 00:12:14 its my first rocket and im making it a multi staging one
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:35:54 1x7 blocks have a weird hitbox
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:00 you cant place them upside down
bug-reports 2021-04-14 01:36:11 part of them will clip into the block above
help 2021-04-15 04:25:38 how do i make a suggestion
help 2021-04-15 04:25:44 or not
help 2021-04-15 04:25:46 lmfao
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:25:49 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:36:44 hmm ok
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:24 $suggest
[Slippery Block]
[BUILDING]

The slippery block acts like a paint in a way that allows touching blocks to be seperated from eachother. As of right now, if you attach a block to a motor, and connect the blocks on both sides of the motor, the motor will get stuck and nothing will rotate. However, with the new slippery block, blocks on both sides of the motor will become no longer attached and can move freely, while being right next to it. (this is a surface type thing, with no actual size, other than maybe a slightly transparent yellow film over the side its put on)
this way you can make significantly more complex moving structures, without having to make things larger or smaller to accomodate for the active welding setup. (perhaps the slippery block can break the weld between one block and another block to function)
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:30 still not working
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:44 oh
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:45 just realized
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:51 the 1x0.9 block does exist but
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:37:54 its not surface
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:38:00 and still cant be applied in as many ways
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:38:26 this completely seperates two blocks invisbly with nothing inbetween
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:40:55 !rank
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:40:59 so close
bot-central 2021-04-15 04:41:10 once i get level 2 i can use the suggesstion thing right
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:39:07 is there anyone at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:39:09 i can show a report to
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:39:17 i have video proof of a massive rope lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:39:19 trails and all
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:35 uh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:40 he isnt blacklisting anyone
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:44 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:47 you meant universally
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:48 uh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:40:53 whatt is blacklist abusing
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:41:10 use lag machines and blacklist everyone so they cant do anything abou t it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:41:24 tthen the shredder does nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:41:57 so you can kill without being killed basically
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:09 id say thats punishable
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:10 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:19 supposedly admins arent reading reports
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:21 <#623337136267067393>
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:25 read the stuff in there
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:42:46 i agree
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:43:41 in a world where mods moderate
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:43:46 id assume a tempban
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:27:45 ive been making a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:27:52 i have some questions about parts
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:00 inside my rocket
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:01 i have a
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:05 space station sort of thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:16 and my goal is to fly the rocket high above the altitude meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:28 eject the station and anchor it
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:44 the station is important because it has missiles on it
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:28:55 multiple individually controllable missiles
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:29:01 which were  a pain to bind
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:29:43 the missiles on my station are very compact
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:29:46 less than 10 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:29:55 however
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:30:01 decouplers leave parts on both sides of the coupler
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:30:24 is there any method of decoupling that leaves nothing on one side
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:32:20 how
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:32:24 how does that decouple
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:32:47 its a
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:32:54 spring connected between two blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 19:33:36 anything most likely
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 18:11:26 now that mods dont read reports the servers have a tot of lag machines rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 18:11:54 this ones a rope device
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 18:12:02 pulls you in and drops your framerate to none
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 01:56:02 pain crazy when I still canâ€™t make complex moving vehicles
general 2021-05-01 20:43:03 you need to have a certain level role i believe
general 2021-05-01 20:43:06 the image rank
general 2021-05-01 20:43:10 read  the rules information though
general 2021-05-01 20:43:12 thatll help
general 2021-05-06 20:57:48 yoo madattak online doe
general 2021-05-06 20:57:59 rip
general 2021-05-06 20:58:00 got faked
general 2021-05-06 20:58:03 not based or redpilled
bug-reports 2021-05-10 19:22:11 Did not see that coming
creations-chat 2021-05-10 19:27:29 girls dont exist also opinion on what ah yes the cannon had a supressor
general 2021-05-17 16:51:26 Will there ever be an increase on block limits
general 2021-05-17 16:51:35 Im at my last 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 09:46:35 whats a good way to build a small con trol system
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 09:46:43 so i can fly
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 09:46:50 
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:25:38 im having issues building to the side of my creations
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:26:02 i know its a common bug but how do i fix that
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:26:36 tf did you guys do
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:27:18 i cant place blocks to the side of my stuff help
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:29:08 les goo baybee
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:29:37 can you talk a little less, i think a bug in your code is causing you to reply many times too fast
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:30:22 repeat after me: "!mute <@159985870458322944>"
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:31:53 ITS BROKEN EVEN WORSE TF
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 04:32:18 NO SPAWN ZONE
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 05:03:38 so what can we do about lag mahcines
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 05:04:56 theres a guy in my server with one
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 05:08:34 ok so like half the servers ive joined have people with large lag machines
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 05:08:58 actual unplayable, worse than the inability to place blocks
general 2023-07-14 06:47:33 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/h3vr/images/7/78/Whizzbanger.png/revision/latest?cb=20210102051721 I FOUND IT
general 2023-07-14 06:47:39 oh i dont have embeds
general 2023-07-14 06:47:40 whatever

general 2023-07-14 06:49:06 its a 50bmg hammer
general 2023-07-14 06:49:27 you hit the firing pin on the back to strike the primer
general 2023-07-14 06:49:36 thus turning what is in front of you into thin glue
general 2023-07-14 06:49:47 -demoman tf2 kinda quote
