The Tale of a_rat2 (557494636352897024)
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:35:11 "There are more planes in the sea than submarines in the sky"
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:36:07 Very epic
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:38:48 If they wait like 3 years they deserve it
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:39:04 That's some serious dedication
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:39:39 Fair point
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:42:02 Why do people even copy builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:42:39 One time I saw a guy copying something I made and I was just confused as to why
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:43:04 Like it wasn't even one of my cool builds it was 2 objects attached to a spinning thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:43:48 But if they put in the effort to learn they could make a good build of whatever they want
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:44:13 Depends on what you're making
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:44:27 I usually take 2 hours to make my stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:44:56 Tutorials are fine for stuff like motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:45:54 Ultimate gamer moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:46:35 I feel like a bunch of people start out using tutorials but later down the line make their own stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:46:47 Atleast thats what was my expirence
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:47:41 I was super young when I used tutorials but I make my own stuff now
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:48:27 A helicopter was the first thing I tried to make but I forgot to add the propeller blades
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:49:48 I started with battlebots and I still make them
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:50:17 Jets are cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:58:07 I'm actually a rat
general 2021-05-28 23:03:00 Maybe more soft colors would help?
general 2021-05-28 23:04:13 Build
general 2021-05-28 23:04:46 Build is more simple
general 2021-05-28 23:05:07 It
general 2021-05-28 23:06:47 Background color
general 2021-05-28 23:07:05 I like the dark gray more than light gray
general 2021-05-28 23:09:18 Why
general 2021-05-28 23:16:45 Too round
general 2021-05-28 23:19:25 Better
general 2021-05-28 23:21:37 All fun until somebody saves the same build 60 times
general 2021-05-28 23:24:42 More crazy
general 2021-05-28 23:25:29 That's the crazy part
bot-central 2021-05-29 00:05:13 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:20:10 Kyle
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:51:50 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:52:03 Half of the replies are just "Kyle"
bot-central 2021-05-29 00:53:38 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:54:43 Name the plane Kyle
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:55:25 Kyle is the highest voted name
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:56:15 Walter
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:56:43 Asexual is not being attracted to people
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:57:33 Is Kyle a good name or is Walter better
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:57:46 Kyle or Walter
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:58:14 Fuck politics Kyle vs Walter is where it's at
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:58:34 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:58:52 You dont name a child bob
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:59:02 You name them Bobby and they transform into bob
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 00:59:41 Kinda like how you don't name a kid Tim you name him Timmy and he transforms into Tim
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:00:05 Drop what topic
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:00:31 We're talking about Walter vs Kyle rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:00:47 We aren't harassing anyone
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:01:02 We are discussing names
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:01:23 How dare you
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:01:26 I'm a rat
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:03:00 No it's what happens when you break the rules
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:03:24 No
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:03:31 That is not pc related
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:03:46 Not pc related
general 2021-05-29 01:05:09 <#384021699466756107>  is very messy rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:06:15 Could we take this to general
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 01:06:22 This isn't related to pc
bot-central 2021-05-29 01:09:25 !rank
general 2021-05-29 02:23:31 Isn't that a half life doctor
creations-chat 2021-05-29 02:32:15 How can I improve this since it got 20 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:40:52 Oh haha very funny funnyman
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:43:05 It's deathroll from battlebots and it's not a saw blade or amugs
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:51:25 "Nobody likes battlebots"
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 07:14:13 Both are good but I lean towards the 2nd tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 07:16:01 Top
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 07:20:17 Motorlock is the way
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 07:23:11 Total playtime I think

plane-crazy 2021-05-29 07:30:23 How did it not crash before lol
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:53:53 Yo are these guys talking about life in the meme channel
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:54:49 Why do we need work though
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:01 We can enjoy life even if we are worthless
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:29 I wouldn't say miserable
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:45 And I'm ok with that
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:06 There's nothing we can do about time so why worry
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:51 We can't do that though
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:27 Well then that's just what the afterlife is
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:59:44 I just wanna remind yall we are discussing God our existence the afterlife and religion in the funny meme channel
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:00:22 It doesn't matter if we are wrong if we don't know
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:00:37 There's nothing we could have done to be right since we didn't know
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:01:51 Funny meme channel is for the discussion about God right now
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:02:26 I have a existential crisis every once in a while when I think about death so its ok
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:04:18 Ultimately we can say there is no point in life but if we just lay down and die we are wasting the non existant point we had
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:05:31 Btw as a new discussion how unethical is too much?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:05:49 At what point is it no longer science and just torture?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:06:46 We can say that the monkey head transplant was very unethical but it helped further the science of transplants
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:43 We are animals but we are different
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:16 Btw nice pfp
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:56 Not everything in life has to have meaning or a point
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:15 Playing games doesn't really have a point but we still enjoy them
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:58 We have technology
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:10:48 With the freedom of being able to do what we want we inevitably encounter the issue of other people
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:18 Same
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:40 Hey you didn't have to do my bro like that
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:12:08 I mean true but still he didn't hurt anyone
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:12:31 He just came to give his Christian homes a fistbump
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:00 Reality is what you make of it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:16 If you want it to be messed up it's messed up
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:24 If you want it to be happy it's happy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:52 We can't say "reality is" as a statement without contradicting ourselves
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:14:14 Reality isn't a solid thing since it changes like the flow of water
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:14:29 Thus we cannot make a hard statement on what it is or isn't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:02 We cant
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:12 But that doesn't meant we can't enjoy it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:52 But xan you really just point at something like the laws of physics and go "that's reality"
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:20 Sure we can say what we are expirencing right now is reality but is it really?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:39 We're in a taco
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:17:44 The most correct answer we can give as to what reality is would be "we don't know"
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:19:58 Realistically we probably aren't alone in the universe
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:11 Theres just so much space
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:41 The alien life is probably just micro organisms but it's something
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:52 Have you seen the new adventure time episode?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:11 I thought it was a very interesting outlook on the afterlife
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:31 I have a link to the episode if you want to watch it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:46 I'll dm you
general 2021-05-29 11:43:06 Me?
general 2021-12-07 14:37:58 If you build as a vertical Spinner you could add ballast to the weapon because it would brace you against the floor when you hit something
general 2021-12-07 14:54:53 What is the arena for the battlebots?
general 2021-12-07 15:06:16 That hasn't competed for like 10 years
general 2021-12-07 15:06:58 It never competed due to electrical problems so
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:01:12 How are you gonna make a invertible axe
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:01:49 Can we see the design you saw on uk tv
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:37 Are you talking about terrorhurtz
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:48 Because terrorhurtz isn't invertible
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:49 Are you talking about stinger bruh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:05:38 Gabriel is the biggest robot wars Bot iirc
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:13:42 This?
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:31:54 That's not how it works lol
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:10 Saws have 0 bite and grind unlike disks
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:57 We do weekly tournaments for it lol
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:33:42 Dude you judge by rank your opinion is invalid
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:15 Apologies for not spending 300 hours for a rank that just changes your names color
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:37 Bars get more bite and get side swiped better while disks hit harder but can get side swiped
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:54 They do damage yes but that's not the only factor
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:25 They're lifters iirc they are powered
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:50 https://youtu.be/KF1msyHmIBc
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:38:44 0:18 they are powered
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:04 From the wiki "For Discovery Season 5 of BattleBots, MadCatter returned a considerably more potent machine. The team largely ditched the ineffective hammer, though it was seen one time against Malice, and opted for modular spinning weaponry. Each weapon required a lithium polymer battery with different specifications to cope with its demands, though MadCatter's main configuration for featured a thick vertical disc spinner and single lifting arm. MadCatter"
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:26 Because sawblaze broke it you can literally see it breaking the lifter
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:43:36 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:29 It's season 5
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:48:20 You can literally see the chain powering the forks
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:49:33 Wdym don't exist
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:49:50 They used both those config
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:43:17 We complain about how it's not accurate lol
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:57 From what I've heard he's rematched everyone except you and still won so
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:26 Wdym ignored them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:56 Accidentally
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:57 How
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:09:59 Not really considering he got the same results after turning it down
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:16 So why not do the rematch
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:13:18 I can try and see if he wants to rematch
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:26 They do
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:16:10 Aight
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:18:20 He has made messages like months ago in different servers
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:04 You kinda are going for realism in some ways though making bots be based off actual battlebots and stuff
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:23:46 I wasn't complaining I was just pointing out how you are going for realism in some ways
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:27:48 In my eyes the whole only real bots and talking about no big small bots irl is kinda going for realism
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:32 
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:31:26 It didn't weigh half the bot though only the top spun
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:01 Either way in my opinion I don't think full body spinners should really get a bonus that large
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:39:30 You probably should have clarified it was allowed but I don't think grav should really be allowed
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:10 ^
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:53 A vertical Spinner is meant to hit the other bot upwards but with high grav you basically can't do that but If it was extra ballast you could still do that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:21 Agreed
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:16 These guys could probably help with the rules for the future if you want help
