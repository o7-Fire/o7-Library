help 2022-02-25 01:25:27 Is there a way to change the controls on different engines? I want to make downward thrusters on a floating machine, but it keeps clashing with my forward engines
help 2022-02-25 01:26:23 How do I do it?
help 2022-02-25 01:26:46 Thanks
help 2022-02-25 01:27:26 nope
help 2022-02-25 01:27:56 What's "on/off mode only" do?
help 2022-02-25 01:28:11 Does it make the thing single button taps?
help 2022-02-25 01:28:23 Thanks
general 2022-02-25 01:57:07 I've made a gun mounted vehicle that can fly itself around and parachute into a drop zone
general 2022-02-25 01:57:21 The only problem is it spins out in the air if you turn too much
general 2022-02-25 01:59:23 Seriously though how to I combat the midair spinout
general 2022-02-25 01:59:30 So I just make the wings longer?
general 2022-02-25 02:00:15 My creation likes to spin around really fast in the air if I turn for too long
general 2022-02-25 02:02:24 Your mother couldn't handle me
general 2022-02-25 02:05:05 I regret joining this server
general 2022-02-25 02:06:37 Bro I'm stealing that like I'm the British museum taking Egyptian mummies
general 2022-02-25 02:11:34 Damn bro
general 2022-02-25 02:11:39 Can't post my meme

general 2022-02-25 02:18:01 No it's a text meme
general 2022-02-25 02:18:10 It got auto deleted for spam
general 2022-02-25 02:19:03 Is there a block that can make turrets turn?
general 2022-02-25 02:20:00 Yes
general 2022-02-25 02:20:20 Counter argument, YOU put the acid in my eyes
general 2022-02-25 02:26:49 Is there a mirror mode or something? Building this boat is annoying without iy

general 2022-02-25 02:29:24 Bro someone put a bunch of helium in a tanker ship
general 2022-02-25 02:29:28 It just launched
general 2022-02-25 02:49:51 Where do you find the sprinkler in the build menu
general 2022-02-25 02:50:09 Thanks
general 2022-02-25 02:52:04 Do you need to unlock it? I can't find it
general 2022-02-25 02:52:34 Thanks
general 2022-02-25 02:55:36 I was lied to, the sprinklers do not turn blocks
general 2022-02-25 02:55:43 My dreams of working turrets are over
help 2022-02-25 02:56:33 What block can turn other blocks?
help 2022-02-25 02:56:37 Or does that not exist
help 2022-02-25 03:00:34 Thanks
general 2022-02-25 22:46:52 My open air boat is perfectly balanced but somehow turning left
general 2022-02-25 22:47:23 None of my turning propellers are on so I'm confused
general 2022-02-25 22:47:35 Actually I use a gaming laptop and it's not like that
general 2022-02-25 22:47:45 The most it does for me is randomly boot me from the wifi
general 2022-02-25 23:33:06 No
