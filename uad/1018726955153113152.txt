general 2023-07-13 00:07:23 Not to mention that the tiktok ceo tried to send Chinese propaganda to the US
general 2023-07-13 00:07:42 You know tiktok is messed up when china has their own version of tiktok
general 2023-07-13 00:08:03 I never said that
general 2023-07-13 00:08:08 no itâ€™s cuz
general 2023-07-13 00:08:20 they donâ€™t use regular tiktok in china cuz itâ€™s full of American influence
general 2023-07-13 00:08:29 so China has their own version
general 2023-07-13 00:08:40 to keep American influence out
general 2023-07-13 00:09:04 ðŸ’€
general 2023-07-13 00:10:14 tiktok is owned by a Chinese company
