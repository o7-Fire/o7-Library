general 2023-05-08 10:28:39 or like build with a 0.5 grid
general 2023-05-08 10:28:43 bruh what
general 2023-05-08 10:28:47 that's BS
general 2023-05-08 10:29:02 how

general 2023-05-08 10:29:37 no i mean with any item
general 2023-05-08 10:30:02 im trying to recreate superheavy rocket configuration
general 2023-05-08 10:30:05 it's hard with the grid
general 2023-05-08 10:30:22 wtf is motorlock
general 2023-05-08 10:30:53 that's not what i asked
general 2023-05-08 10:30:54 at all
general 2023-05-08 10:30:56 ???
general 2023-05-08 10:32:03 yeah that's not what i asked for tho
general 2023-05-08 10:36:32 sorry yeah you're right next time ill assume the game doesn't have features every other physics based plane/rocket creation game has
general 2023-05-08 10:37:39 yes, thank you for repeating my point to me.
general 2023-05-08 10:38:51 Someone go teach this man what a hyperbole is.
general 2023-05-08 10:40:28 okay is there any way in the game to increase the height limit
general 2023-05-08 10:40:32 its too short to make starship
general 2023-05-08 10:41:31 the dev missing out on loads of robux if they made an increase height limit gamepass
general 2023-05-08 10:42:53 capitalising on potential profits = being high
general 2023-05-08 10:42:55 okay
general 2023-05-08 10:46:00 who coded it? a 12 year old? why would you make the game un-editable
general 2023-05-08 10:46:49 sounds like you need to make a new game and rework everything then
general 2023-05-08 10:47:04 code should be segmented and easy to change
general 2023-05-08 10:47:55 using subroutines is very very basic coding knowledge
general 2023-05-08 10:48:04 why would you not do that
general 2023-05-08 10:50:05 maybe he coded it before he learnt how to code properly
general 2023-05-08 10:50:10 as the game was made in 2014
general 2023-05-08 10:50:45 so he's the one who cant code properly?

general 2023-05-09 18:57:05 ugc bodies
general 2023-05-09 18:58:47 they will probably disallow the avatars to have breasts
general 2023-05-09 18:59:50 i know i know but it's roblox..
general 2023-05-09 18:59:59 none of the other female roblox avatars have that
general 2023-05-09 19:00:05 so why should ugc
general 2023-05-09 19:00:23 nah they'll probably manually review every one
general 2023-05-09 19:00:26 well
general 2023-05-09 19:00:29 i sure hope they do
general 2023-05-09 19:00:35 or we'll see some outta pocket stuff

general 2023-05-09 19:03:00 items being uploaded every single minute
general 2023-05-09 19:03:12 every avatar will be very different

general 2023-05-09 19:04:14 the ONLY thing that i worry about is quality control
general 2023-05-09 19:04:22 if "anyone" can upload ugc
general 2023-05-09 19:04:30 then 99% of it will be ðŸ’©
general 2023-05-09 19:04:35 might be hard to find good quality stuff
