plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:30:29 is it just me, or do ballast tanks not sink? I press the sink button for my ballast tanks but they don't go down. pressing the float button for them works, though.
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:30:36 any reason for this?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:32:04 I have like 100 of them
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 06:32:12 they always float, but never sink

creations-chat 2020-05-20 03:23:57 wing panels aren't gonna work out, I tried and the supports would be disconnected from the wing (visually at least, idk physically)
bug-reports 2020-05-20 03:29:27 I flew my biplane into one of the chonky rotors on the floating island and got my engines destroyed, but after I flew away I could still increase/reduce throttle and fly normally, just at a reduced speed. I have a roblox capture if you want it.

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 05:39:08 oohh they use rocket engines or conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 05:39:18 they hide them and use them to manuever
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:40:12 *laughs in 600mph 5 block wide purple sadness jet*
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:40:41 you could probably out manuever them though
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:41:09 get a wacky enough plane and you might have a seizure in the air, just enough to get away from one

general 2020-05-20 07:43:49 extra credits, oversimplified, and history matters are great history channels if anyone wanted one to watch (and yeah nobody asked but whatever)
general 2020-05-20 07:44:18 extra credits does more than history too, like mythology

general 2020-05-21 00:52:01 outlines deserved to burn :)
general 2020-05-21 00:56:32 outlines made stuff look like it was just a mess of cobbled together parts
general 2020-05-21 00:56:49 now parts actually look like they were connected in a good reliable way
general 2020-05-21 00:58:49 i think color randomize is where the color of a painted block gets varied slightly to make it look better
general 2020-05-21 00:59:04 so it isnt a perfect shade for each block but it isnt a huge contrast
general 2020-05-21 01:00:04 hard to see the outlines in that lol
general 2020-05-21 01:00:08 such blur
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 01:00:26 speaking of water, im working on a submarine thing
