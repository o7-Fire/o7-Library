plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:03:09 So, is it safe for a ship to go at 49 sps, even if it's a 1:50 scale model to go along with scaled-down realism?
bot-central 2022-04-04 01:07:52 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:09:26 And for scaled ships, I usually build them to challenge myself to create a "what if I can make this design much better".
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:12:43 What is this?
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:13:42 Or a more-futuristic version of the VTOL's we see in James Cameron's Avatar.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:14:06 Sorry to hear that....

creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:18:08 It seems to be okay to me.

creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:21:21 Does it have any wing stabilizers?
general 2022-04-04 01:23:21 Why destroy that World Wonder and hate France?
creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:24:58 Additional wing plates that steer the plane without additional usage of machinery such as propellors, rocket engines, or jet engines. (For the Yaw, Pitch, & Roll)
general 2022-04-04 01:26:35 Green Plant with Giant Fruit..?
general 2022-04-04 01:27:27 It's pronounced Portuguese though...
general 2022-04-04 01:27:56 Sorry, I had to...
general 2022-04-04 01:28:43 Portuguese is a language, place, and thing owned by Portugal.
general 2022-04-04 01:29:48 You've misplaced a few words with Portugal and Portuguese, chill out.
general 2022-04-04 01:30:41 Did you see a Portuguese Man-O-War yet?
general 2022-04-04 01:31:36 It's a type of Jellyfish that can use its membrane to literally sail across the ocean.
general 2022-04-04 01:35:31 Also: The concept of Oceanic Navigation was invented by the Portuguese during the Age of Discovery. They also built Carracks and Caravels to travel across oceans.

plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:36:43 When the bot goes for broke. (Not literally to charge with bayonets, but it broke for real)
creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:37:41 Why can't the channel stay on-topic...
creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:41:02 wdym, it looked good.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:43:22 Who's also into building scale-model ships on the Plane Crazy Game?
creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:44:33 Sounds like someone is trying to get the money while copying other's builds without permission or prior knowledge.
general 2022-04-04 01:45:32 They can still see them in their logs that we players cannot see.

the-dump 2022-04-04 01:50:10 When somebody copy other's work without prior permission or consent, this is what they'll expect at their "conference":
Some random dude: If your builds are that good, why not demonstrate it on the stage for the audience?
The copycat: I'm screwed, where's the instructions when I needed them!?
Another person: Pay it up for twice the value, thief.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 01:51:31 Is that a suspension of the M4 Sherman?
help 2022-04-04 01:52:54 Add a bulldozer blade to the front that can be raised and lowered while the mobile base is travelling difficult terrain?
help 2022-04-04 02:01:29 Oh okay.
general 2022-04-04 02:06:42 Is that a Moschops?
general 2022-04-04 02:07:25 Lol
general 2022-04-04 02:07:45 However, it looks sad though...
the-dump 2022-04-04 02:14:03 Must be at least Lv. 3 according to Mee6. (Check the chat level in <#384027830192832513> )
general 2022-04-04 02:16:04 That's not a candle collection...
general 2022-04-04 02:16:29 And that is also a clay disk that was shot by it.
general 2022-04-04 02:17:04 Ah, ty for the clarification.
general 2022-04-04 02:18:00 Cannot break the right to bear a weapon though, for good reason back in the Revolutionary War.
general 2022-04-04 02:21:05 Like the kids in *The Series of Unfortunate Events* after the fire?
general 2022-04-04 02:23:04 Approximately from the pic, it seems to be 12x5x9 as a completed product. (LxWxH)
