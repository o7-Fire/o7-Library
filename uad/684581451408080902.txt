the-dump 2020-05-22 02:06:36 I know this isnt the right server for this question but has anyone made a hover engine?
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:07:57 I have made one that has no foreseeable max speed and gains 4k speed a second.
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:11:27 Has it been done or did I make a new engine design?
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:15:42 Fricc
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:16:58 In all honsety most motors are the same thing so its pretty easy to make one
the-dump 2020-05-22 02:17:07 Especially suspension reliant ones
the-dump 2020-05-22 04:58:38 There have been less shredders recently...
the-dump 2020-05-22 04:58:51 Hopefully they arent planning something
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:00:14 Wait, are they called bugs or shredders? Ive heard them be referenced to as both

the-dump 2020-05-22 05:05:04 Exept if its helpful
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:24 I just checked the roblox store
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:40 Why do they sell protogen heads now?
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:06:53 Im not complaining
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:07:29 Its just a strange step in the direction of recruitment.
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:03 Question
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:20 Do jet engines need air in this game or do they just work?
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:08:31 Oh ok
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:17:09 I tried to think of how this would be executed but I realised I only know standard FRC code.
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:18:10 
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:30:25 Oh no
the-dump 2020-05-22 05:30:40 Should I delete it?
general 2020-05-24 21:26:05 Dude keeps on ramming us in a non pvp server, its so annoying
general 2020-05-24 21:29:28 My friend is in this server so I cannot join a new one
general 2020-05-24 21:29:49 Anyone have any ideas for a fling contraption?
general 2020-05-24 21:31:30 A thing to fling his sports car
general 2020-05-24 21:33:20 Well how else can I combat him?
general 2020-05-24 21:33:51 We tried
general 2020-05-24 21:34:30 He isnt in my spawn box, he is driving around ramming people and my friend is in this server so it auto connects me here
general 2020-05-24 21:38:54 Wait theres a feature for that?
general 2020-05-24 21:39:17 Holy fricc how did I not know
creations-chat 2020-08-12 01:46:53 I have realised that you can swim on the glass in the room where you get the water jet, so far my efforts to get a water propeller in the room have been futile.

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:07:11 Nice you of landing gear, never thought of that
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:07:23 *use
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:13:09 Why do people who dont know how to play plane crazy just not do the tutorial? Legit most people who ask for help say they didnt do the tutorial.
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:15:22 I get how some people don't understand how large their wings should be or have the engine in an area where it will force the entire plane down but come on!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:15:46 ^^^
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:17:14 Wait really?!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:18:50 Yeah, and the tutorial tells you that as well!
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:26:43 "Staff are less likely to give you a rank if your creation is considered to be low effort."
So what makes a build be considered normal effort, Is painting and making it smooth enough or what?
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:27:25 Ok got it
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:38:15 Very inspiring
the-dump 2020-09-15 01:03:01 I am so close to having a 200 block plane but I already used all available space for details ;-;
the-dump 2020-09-15 01:04:56 Ok

the-dump 2020-09-15 01:08:01 
the-dump 2020-09-15 01:08:12 maybe fuel blocks...
general 2020-09-15 02:20:54 Ah yes, that
the-dump 2020-09-15 02:24:45 
the-dump 2020-09-15 02:25:07 I was screwing around and made a decoy for online class. I was not marked absent at all.

the-dump 2020-09-15 04:44:03 Very incriminating

the-dump 2020-09-15 04:44:45 Demand
general 2020-09-15 17:19:28 Hands down it has to be the half wedge
general 2020-09-15 17:19:47 Which half wedge? Idk
general 2020-09-15 17:20:25 True that one is good
general 2020-09-15 17:21:29 Curved wings or angular?
general 2020-09-15 17:22:31 Warhammer
general 2020-09-15 17:23:28 Whats a good way to shave weight off a build besides half blocks?
general 2020-09-15 17:24:03 Without helium, we need to conserve that stuff.
general 2020-09-15 17:25:11 How much does a disconnecter solid bit weigh?
general 2020-09-15 17:26:02 Are trap doors lighter than half blocks?
general 2020-09-15 17:26:50 I am dumb
general 2020-09-15 17:27:23 I will now go commit misplace a block in a motorlocked build
general 2020-09-15 17:28:08 Its all about that piston lock
general 2020-09-15 17:28:25 Yes
general 2020-09-15 17:28:35 Hydrolics... whatever its called
general 2020-09-15 17:29:44 Smooth motor is evil
general 2020-09-15 17:31:00 Yes, with square motor you can tell if its moving
general 2020-09-15 17:31:11 Its untrustworthy
general 2020-09-15 17:32:58 〽
general 2020-09-15 17:33:38 Yes!

plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:51:35 Are there any rules against making small aircraft to latch onto opponents and activate a parachute?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:51:48 Does that count as ramming?

bot-central 2020-09-24 23:08:55 Exactly
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:09:58 Imagine landing on miniature space donut earth
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:12:21 I am starting to see why not many games seek input from their fans
bot-central 2020-09-25 04:16:45 -mapsuggest deeper/wider water
[Map]
The deeper down you go the darker the water gets and the harder it is to move, maybe even making motors useless once you pass a certain depth and making rope useful for pulling and pushing joints
bot-central 2020-09-25 04:17:23 Nice idea curly

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 20:01:38 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 05:46:53 I will write that down. The hardest part of brown is finding a good way to use it with other colors, it can blend together with anything but inly certain shades work. (I deleted comment cause I thought it would go somewhere else)
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 05:47:03 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 05:48:01 I keep on forgetting how huge cockpits are
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 05:52:35 Something about one seated cockpits are just strange.

The missile
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:31:08 <@365193579779325972>. Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:32:52 <@491789696117112842> cant we just use normal missiles and have a mortar?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:33:55 Use explosive balls and a spring at max power, set it to retain weld
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:35:33 Maybe suggest it
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:37:28 Also try using a secondary function like " dosnet explode when it touches water." To differentiate it from missiles or just launching tnt to really show why we need something.
