Control surfaces grouping

[gameplay]
Changes the control surfaces too how they should work like left wing, or rudder, or tail wing. This makes it so you can have multiple working builds at once while not needing too create custom control surfaces. This would work great with aircraft carriers with working aircrafts. You also won’t need to change controls when switching spawn location which makes it more mobile friendly as well due to mobile not good with custom control surfaces
