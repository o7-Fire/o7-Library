plane-crazy 2022-02-02 16:18:23 What is the Plane Crazy Record for the biggest ship? Asking for no friends
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 16:34:46 Definitely a hand
general 2022-02-02 17:25:59 A liquid.
general 2022-02-02 17:26:22 Its obvious, everyone knows air is liquid.

plane-crazy 2023-04-26 21:17:54 Not gonna lie, real question, whats the largest build in terms of everything, BUT mostly the block count?
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:12:42 Hmm yes, but working as a car, ship, airplane?
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:13:25 Which ones? (For research purposes.)

plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:15:13 Is that just using a singular plot?
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:15:23 Singular PLAYERS plot.
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:17:35 If so, then theyve got me beaten,
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:17:49 Remove the tail and I make a HUGE W win.
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:20:56 Thats pretty insane how they made that with only one plot then,
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:21:27 BUT the thing is,
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:21:45 Im sure the interior is impossible to make and its just empty since you need the entire thing for one plot,
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 22:22:00 So that means I can definitely make a larger build than that, right?
