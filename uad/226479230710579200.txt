creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:12:07 no
creations-chat 2018-11-04 20:12:11 :P
bug-reports 2018-11-04 22:40:15 but its welded before saving
bug-reports 2018-11-04 22:40:31 anyways i fixed it by connecting the backs
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 20:19:03 theres a reason i suggested inner wedges, its because i need to make an outward slant while keeping my shape, using wedges, but currently thats not possible
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:04:16 managed to do a backflip
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:04:23 gonna do it using my painted vtol tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:08:08 (Backflip evidence https://youtu.be/wMFi9YJzlZ0)
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:08:38 no i did not, but let me review anyways
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:10:12 no i just chose to do it with my vtol
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:10:47 gotta get video
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 21:11:08 oh sweet jesus
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:14:41 made it so if i wanted(why though) i could force a crash of the vtol i've been showing you all, i put a dual dissconnector join in the tail, and bound it to H, when i hit it, my craft will break in half and slam into the ground
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:14:58 dont know why i did it though
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:15:15 ill get a video
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:16:08 up to you
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:16:30 OH NOES

plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:25:53 just realised, it looks like a goose when i break it
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:25:58 or duck?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:15:38 made a more realistic crash update https://youtu.be/4pFyyP5XmVA
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:16:46 does this game allow the making of parachutes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:17:09 using uh the wing frame parts right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:17:18 that too
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:17:41 but i noticed after forcing a crash of my plane, the wings will float down instead of dropping sometimes
creations-chat 2018-11-06 01:38:18 i'd say its unlocked form would be close enough but im not a mod
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:46:53 can magnets grab other peoples creations?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 01:47:08 awwwww
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:45:33 Ay i see i've been thanked
creations-chat 2018-11-06 03:45:53 Your welcome dude
creations-chat 2018-11-06 22:40:46 made an aircraft arresting wire, capable of stopping more aircraft on landing, or preventing them from taking of(Uses many delta wings as spikes)
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:49:02 for my arresting wire ima go test it in random servers to see if it works on most craft
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:49:48 oh shoot my arresting wire is composed of 154 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:50:20 most of them are pistons used for extending it into a wire like position

creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:26:14 my guess then is roblox did an oof of their servers or something
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:26:25 bad update friday, ima start calling it that
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:27:13 trying to join direct
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:27:42 got into one by joining direct, try that
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:36:44 right heres what i got of the "A-10" so far, really not much to be proud of but it looks somewhat close
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:37:17 MEGA OOF
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:37:44 i would use the 1x1 delta wings but they are bugged rn
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:38:07 but theres only one chute
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:42:32 right i just had to blacklist a bunch of people, for driving right into me whilst i was building they "Apologized" but im sure it was sarcasm, they arent laughing now, they got sent back to their build zones and kicked from flight mode
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:48:56 i had to remove my a-10 they were getting on my nerves, build aborted
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:56:07 they ended up calling me a 10 year old became really toxic, the reason why is they were both blacklisted users, for the reason above, so they were most likely 10
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:57:31 oh i didnt make it, i aborted due to toxic players
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:57:48 then i shoved em off the map, funny reactions, then more salt, so i left
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:58:32 they were like, oh wow hes def 10 years old, but i can get a legit paying job and i have a bank card,
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:58:43 they were confused at how i pushed em off the map tho
creations-chat 2018-11-17 01:59:26 (this is why you dont play on public servers children)
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:00:51 sometimes you get the best reactions to edge pushes when they are acting toxic
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:01:02 or blacklist flight mode resets
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:01:26 [Noob] WOAH HOW DID YOU MAKE THAT?!
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:02:06 i told them to find me on the discord, they were like what is discord, so they were below the +13 age restrictions
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:02:32 and they were calling a 17 year old 10 XD
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:03:00 (Yes i am 17 if you are going to get salty about it leave now)
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:03:15 (or face the wrath of being blocked
creations-chat 2018-11-17 02:03:42 i tend not to deal with extreme salt or toxcisity, not since rocket league (Shudders)
