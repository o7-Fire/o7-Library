creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:43:03 yeah they dont
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:43:09 But I'm trying to make manual hydrofoiks
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:43:29 My goal is just to make a boat with the least draft as possible
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:45:26 my own swashplates are just 360 rotors fitted onto a basic noob turret config
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:45:29 they still work
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:46:17 I've not researched helicopter avionics at all I just know they tilt
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:46:22 What do those fancy springs do
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:46:31 *suspension
help 2019-06-19 17:48:37 Hi it's me again
help 2019-06-19 17:49:50 my dreams of making any sort of hydrofoil are still not shattered, anyone got an idea?
help 2019-06-19 17:52:09 basic idea of how they work, which also gives a basic concept of how to implement them somehow
help 2019-06-19 17:53:51 I know they don't work with in-game wings but I am determined to muster all the help I can get to make this concept become true
help 2019-06-19 18:17:38 I guess I need people to research how the game's wings work in water because they do affect movement someway.
bot-central 2019-06-19 18:20:41 hi deciduus
help 2019-06-19 18:22:38 situation is bleak but I'm determined, still
help 2019-06-19 18:23:16 I'll see if I can narrow down the flaws in my builds with these new knowledge
help 2019-06-19 19:42:04 Yeah that's basically it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 19:45:21 or do that *thing* from ropes
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:39:23 xook youre going to have to make a coaxial without a tail rotor
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:39:38 basically make a swashplate for at least a coaxial
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:02:17 why are there so little Russian tanks on creations
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:02:39 I searched through with the search bar
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:03:08 mostly T 34 and very little cold war tanks
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:03:33 I've seen a T90 before but he didn't type in the name so I can't see it again
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:52:10 In order to kickstart a trend of building Russian tanks, especially cold war era ones, I'm showcasing my T-54/55
creations-chat 2019-06-20 03:52:17 
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:27:49 just Russian tanks in general
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:28:21 try searching in the search bar for Russian tanks
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:28:23 Not a lot
creations-chat 2019-06-20 05:43:44 Hawker Hunter
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:50:10 i want to try something
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:50:35 I want to see if the formulae in physics can work in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:51:21 naw basic stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:52:17 like Moment=Force x perpendicular distance
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:52:37 I would like to make a hydraulic system but there are no fluids
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 13:53:06 unless I fill a container full of balls and make a hydraulic like that instead
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:04:05 oh shit Ive got an idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:04:34 make a weighing machine
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:05:54 don't lock motors if your thing doesn't moce
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:05:57 *move
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:06:03 the entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:13:18 guys what happened to VietcongAmbush
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:13:44 what did he do
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:13:46 hhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:14:27 why
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:14:55 broke what rules
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:15:01 he said he posted a meme in general
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:16:08 what are you going to ask him
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:16:26 he's #7974
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:20:21 viet's tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:20:32 depend solely on 1x7
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:20:45 so machineguns shred them
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:22:58 My tanks are supposed to be improvements of his
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:23:05 But his are always non-laggy
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:23:46 on my screen it'll say 378 SPS but his 138 SPS AFV would still beat my AFV in races
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:24:13 that's kinda slow
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:24:37 my Hunter goes 660
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 14:24:58 3x3 fuselage should reliably hit 600, always
creations-chat 2019-06-21 11:07:29 can someone make a russian tank or something
creations-chat 2019-06-21 11:07:35 cold war era
creations-chat 2019-06-21 11:07:54 I want to see how y'all handle the peculiar upside-down bowl shape of the turret
creations-chat 2019-06-21 11:18:03 literally impossible
creations-chat 2019-06-21 11:39:08 <@427466925275217931> get ping'd

help 2019-06-22 10:00:00 Either get a less laggy server or replace blocks with beams whenever possible
creations-chat 2019-06-24 05:56:27 noob turret but more sophisticated
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:10 1x7 beams can't be destroyed by rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:33 what
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:36 but it is
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:35:51 I did intense testing w/ vietcongambush
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:36:04 obviously I don't have a video
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:36:37 beam1x7 can only be destroyed by TNT and machine guns
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:37:38 what
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:38:07 i gain no benefit lying about beam 1x7 and it's rocket-proof properties
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:38:21 how about you do some testing, show me your proof
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:39:48 mr, that wasn't in a controlled environment
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:40:57 there could have been other factors
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:41:04 like machine gun fire
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:41:48 then, there is no conclusion
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:42:39 well at least you should know TNT is also indestructible to everything, right?
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:44:09 I remember shooting very long at someone's maus with TNT armor
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:44:14 it didn't get destroyed
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:45:28 also when my vehicles are bombed to oblivion, only the TNT remains
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:46:40 well yeah
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:46:56 your own TNT can destroy your own TNT
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:47:11 that's the only thing that can destroy TNT, your own explosives
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:49:52 you take this argument too seriously
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:50:29 anyway I don't believe I am ignorant since ignorant people don't do their own research to find the best block for armoring something
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:52:01 you are literally the only person I've met to say that they can
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:52:28 ask mocmish or vietcongambush and they say it can't be destroyed by rockets
creations-chat 2019-06-24 07:54:28 how do we have different experiences
creations-chat 2019-06-24 10:34:00 that's a pretty meh speed for supersonic
creations-chat 2019-06-24 10:34:09 well, "supersonic"
creations-chat 2019-06-24 11:03:13 it's a pretty chonky aeroplane
creations-chat 2019-06-24 11:03:53 if you can remove the 1 layer of bricks on the fuselage, you'd save a lot of weight and also make the plane look a bit better
creations-chat 2019-06-24 15:28:26 chonky
help 2019-06-25 10:44:13 after further research, I've found that beam 1x7 is impervious to direct rocket hits, but if it's in a radius in an explosion of a rocket, it gets slightly damaged or destroyed.
help 2019-06-25 12:17:24 wdym <@456226577798135808>
help 2019-06-25 12:18:08 I can say that rockets act like High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) if we compare it to real life
help 2019-06-25 12:18:19 In terms of damage, I mean
help 2019-06-25 12:19:34 It blows through weak objects (single blocks) easily. If it doesn't destroy armor/walls, it will damage things behind it.
help 2019-06-25 12:20:27 Single blocks don't have any outstanding properties, except it can be used if you want to minimise damage along a long area
help 2019-06-25 12:21:03 As in, instead of two or three 1x4s being destroyed, 1x1s following explosion radius get destroyed
help 2019-06-25 12:21:19 Materials do affect properties, aside from buoyancy and mass.
help 2019-06-25 12:23:07 Fabric has the most frcition amongst the materials, ice, obviously the least.

When making placing wheels for a vehicle, never put fabric 3x3 cylinders next to each other, they cause too much friction between each other. If possible, use Cylinder2.
help 2019-06-25 12:26:35 TNT is an impervious block to everything too
help 2019-06-25 12:28:23 I recommend making the deck and side armor 1x7 while the frontal portion and also the control surfaces (turret elevation and rotating etc) are protected with TNT
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:57:35 that is horrible colour
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:57:52 do you need help, we all can provide better colour codes uk.
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:58:24 well at least it's petite
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:59:11 but that colour is no where close to the ausf H from GuP
creations-chat 2019-06-25 12:59:59 but how did he get that driver port, idk any block that small.
creations-chat 2019-06-25 13:10:28 but what's the block he used for the driver port???
creations-chat 2019-06-25 15:48:55 chonky

help 2019-06-29 16:01:33 Think of ground effects as a zone where a plane can take off but can't exceed the zone because there isn't enough lift
help 2019-06-29 16:02:41 <@429665143677255681> sorry I don't think there's ground effect in Plane Crazy but you can try to make it because the plane will still lift
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:03:22 y'all should I make the Caspian sea monster
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:03:33 Even though ground effect doesn't exist in plane crazy

creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:07:48 Their oil
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:08:12 Romania was resourcefully more important for Germany in our timeline than Italy
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:08:49 Hootler was an ok ruler for war
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:06 But if the Natzis weren't Natzis they might've won
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:20 They could've gotten the help of the Ukrainian but nope they gotta kill them
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:58 His Generals were also quite naive when invading Russia
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:00 SOMEHOW
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:33 Can't believe Hootler was actually right for invading the Caucasus instead of going for Moscow
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:09 Technically he was right
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:13 But he couldn't win
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:22 If he waited he'd get his ass kicked by Russia
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:54 By waiting he'd die even faster
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:12:13 By not waiting he Might've won but they just couldn't
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:01 Imagine if Hootler took power 6 years earlier
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:20 The Soviets in 1920 were so industrially weak they lost to an offensive war against Poland
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:54 If Hootler wasn't a Natzi and a warmonger he would've been a good leader
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:03 Their generals are good
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:12 They just put the wrong people
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:29 They literally were steam rolling in 1940 after they rotated the generalship
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:03 Also in the continuation war Finland would've been destroyed if they didn't surrender
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:37 I'm sure if Hootler exploited the fearmongering of Stalinism he could've incited riots
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:53 But he's a Natzi and they are politically blind
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:16:55 I wonder if he would massacre the Iranians
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:17:15 Iran is a literal anglicisation of the word Aryan uk

general 2019-09-26 12:53:35 BUT THE CURRENT MEANING
general 2019-09-26 12:53:45 Is derogatory
general 2019-09-26 12:53:54 People use it for both, Lucifer
general 2019-09-26 12:54:10 Using the "it's just a word for cigarette" argument is outdated
general 2019-09-26 12:54:45 Only Britain uses the obsolete meaning, even Commonwealth nations and nations who use UK English uses it as a bad term
general 2019-09-26 12:55:11 so just don't say the fa g word
general 2019-09-26 12:55:41 literally ALL THE WORLD uses fag as derogatory

general 2019-09-26 12:57:41 it's not scaring me off because I know damn well it's not a good word

general 2019-09-26 13:12:41 or socdem
general 2019-09-26 13:12:50 do they at least follow socialist policies
general 2019-09-26 13:13:28 still lots of socialist kinda murals in Vietnam even though they are emore of historical things
general 2019-09-26 13:13:34 When I visited Ho Chi Minh

general 2019-09-26 13:15:46 
general 2019-09-26 13:15:56 Malay version is called Popiah
general 2019-09-26 13:16:11 we got it from the south chinese
general 2019-09-26 13:16:29 the Chinese are pretty cool people in the malay archipelago
general 2019-09-26 13:16:58 I mean they may have been massacred few times by us but they pretty cool
general 2019-09-26 13:17:33 south chinese are better than north Chinese excluding the cultural centres <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 13:17:51 so like guangzhou taiwan fuzhou
general 2019-09-26 13:18:08 but there's a lot of prejudice against PRCs in Singapore
general 2019-09-26 13:18:23 the general stereotype is noisy and dirty
general 2019-09-26 13:18:29 people's republic of china
general 2019-09-26 13:18:38 we call mainland chinese PRCs
general 2019-09-26 13:18:48 and Taiwanese Taiwanese or ROCs
general 2019-09-26 13:19:07 PRC invaded Vietnam I mean
general 2019-09-26 13:19:13 and they still are in some way
general 2019-09-26 13:19:17 so of course
general 2019-09-26 13:19:59 Singapore is pretty anti-commie
general 2019-09-26 13:20:16 But our second most popular ideology is socialism
general 2019-09-26 13:20:28 or more specifically demsoc
general 2019-09-26 13:20:36 yes I know
general 2019-09-26 13:20:43 we are anti commie but not anti socialists
general 2019-09-26 13:20:55 the commies have incited riots in early singapore like
general 2019-09-26 13:20:57 three times
general 2019-09-26 13:21:31 singapore is also pretty one-party state but it's only because all other r parties are shit
general 2019-09-26 13:21:40 not because the government is popular
general 2019-09-26 13:21:58 singapore's current president was not even voted in
general 2019-09-26 13:22:21 but the president of singapore is more like a king
general 2019-09-26 13:22:32 Tell me more about Vietnam <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 13:22:40 u southern or northern
general 2019-09-26 13:22:59 omg a non-mekonger
general 2019-09-26 13:23:17 mekong is rad but idk anything about Hanoi area
general 2019-09-26 13:23:58 are there as many motorcycles in Hanoi as saigon
general 2019-09-26 13:24:35 saigon was mad
general 2019-09-26 13:24:48 it was the only non indonesian city I know with so many motorcycles
general 2019-09-26 13:25:04 and indonesia and malaysia are notorious here for motorcyclists
general 2019-09-26 13:25:37 Does anyone in Vietnam actually get unironically mad if I say Saigon instead of HCH
general 2019-09-26 13:25:49 thank god
general 2019-09-26 13:26:05 they might be grandparents
general 2019-09-26 13:26:18 Who would complain about capitalist systems when drunk
general 2019-09-26 13:27:14 are u not going to get a diploma <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 13:27:31 diplomas can get us a $10k job here
general 2019-09-26 13:27:40 if you're lucky and experienced
general 2019-09-26 13:27:50 but everyone is trying to get a degree
general 2019-09-26 13:29:55 how about
general 2019-09-26 13:30:04 I become a bourgeois and not a proletariat
general 2019-09-26 13:30:31 ok but it's Singapore I'm going to be overthrown within two years
general 2019-09-26 13:31:27 my family line originates from runaway royalty from indonesia that migrated to singapore
general 2019-09-26 13:31:28 I am
general 2019-09-26 13:31:33 Definition of bourgeois
general 2019-09-26 13:31:49 except I'm not a tsar
general 2019-09-26 13:32:20 we be too busy with iPhone 11
general 2019-09-26 13:32:39 ok but Singapore is a paradox in a way I guess
general 2019-09-26 13:32:51 we have better public housing than many socialist countries
general 2019-09-26 13:33:04 More effective social policy than many socialist countries
general 2019-09-26 13:33:19 but our society is very capitalist and western
general 2019-09-26 13:33:56 ok we can only be so capitalist since we're asian and the same goes for all asian countries
general 2019-09-26 13:34:07 individualism ain't that popular
general 2019-09-26 13:34:43 Japan and south korea
general 2019-09-26 13:34:55 imagine if Mongolia developed just like south korea
general 2019-09-26 13:35:20 Is Indonesia like
general 2019-09-26 13:35:23 asian romania
general 2019-09-26 13:35:28 because of all that oil
general 2019-09-26 13:35:36 that Japan wanted
general 2019-09-26 13:35:51 so is China the Asian USSR
general 2019-09-26 13:36:28 Hopefully Mongolia is the Asian Finland
general 2019-09-26 13:36:39 I would love to see them kick PRC arse
general 2019-09-26 13:37:00 indonesia is actually trying to control the fire unlike in the amazon
general 2019-09-26 13:37:27 almost every country has some debt
general 2019-09-26 13:37:36 I think Singapore has something like
general 2019-09-26 13:37:41 3 trillion
general 2019-09-26 13:37:44 in debt
general 2019-09-26 13:37:52 maybe 300 billion
general 2019-09-26 13:37:58 I don't remember
general 2019-09-26 13:38:32 so many of world's conflicts happened just because of Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
general 2019-09-26 13:39:33 
general 2019-09-26 13:41:01 good to know that China is still retaining their revolutionary traits
general 2019-09-26 13:41:08 of making people disappear
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:42:10 mouse aim has made helicopters very lethal
plane-crazy 2019-09-26 13:42:33 they can just hover over u and then shoot while you can't elevate ur gun
general 2019-09-26 13:43:02 the sky literally turned red
general 2019-09-26 13:43:06 why wouldn't they
general 2019-09-26 13:44:08 at least Indonesia finally has a president that came from the people tbh
general 2019-09-26 13:44:20 and doesn't have military connections
general 2019-09-26 13:44:29 or connections to other politicians
general 2019-09-26 13:44:56 I still believe their corruption is decreasing
general 2019-09-26 13:45:01 but still corrupt
general 2019-09-26 13:45:27 idk if I can call jokowi corrupt though
general 2019-09-26 13:47:29 I only get better if I pretend a gun is somehow related to a WWII gun or just pretend it's a gun I like
general 2019-09-26 13:48:05 for example since M60 has design principles of FG42 I pretend it's an FG42 and then I get a better kdr
general 2019-09-26 13:49:10 <@331490905846448129> do you get more kills hipfiring or aiming
general 2019-09-26 13:49:45 I can't get kills aiming with assault rifles
general 2019-09-26 13:49:56 unless if it has a scope
general 2019-09-26 13:50:03 like a low magnification scope
general 2019-09-26 13:50:31 recoil messes up vision
general 2019-09-26 13:50:54 hipfiring is better for automatic since recoil doesn't feel as crazy
general 2019-09-26 13:51:51 doesn't AKM have a higher recoil
general 2019-09-26 13:52:00 why can't u play western guns
general 2019-09-26 13:52:18 Can you at least kill a lot with bullpups?
general 2019-09-26 13:53:02 I want dev to add singapore's assault rifle in game
general 2019-09-26 13:53:05 very low recoil
general 2019-09-26 13:53:22 I mean I'm not regurgitating
general 2019-09-26 13:53:43 ive shot the sar21 even though I am only 15
general 2019-09-26 13:53:52 does Vietnam have cadet corps too? <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 13:54:07 like high school military kind of thing
general 2019-09-26 13:54:46 we have that
general 2019-09-26 13:55:05 how am I supposed to describe my
general 2019-09-26 13:55:15 how am I supposed to to describe what cadet corps are
general 2019-09-26 13:55:36 idk any other examples
general 2019-09-26 13:55:56 right I'm too used to not using dm
general 2019-09-26 13:56:39 can you play AK12 then
general 2019-09-26 13:56:41 since it's an AK
general 2019-09-26 13:56:55 or maybe AN-94 since it's kinda AK looking
general 2019-09-26 13:57:10 but AN-94 ironsights are horrendous
general 2019-09-26 13:57:24 try the AN-94 <@331490905846448129> see how bad you are with it
general 2019-09-26 13:59:05 At least the first shot has zero recoil
general 2019-09-26 14:10:27 bullpup approved <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 14:10:42 just aim for the head since it's so easy to aim
general 2019-09-26 14:10:50 actually the neck is best
general 2019-09-26 14:11:28 we are told to aim neck or chest in army so use it in Roblox since there is no neck
general 2019-09-26 14:12:17 zip22 challenge
general 2019-09-26 14:15:46 How do you find that AK-12 shotgun abomination thingy <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 14:16:07 and since it's an AK
general 2019-09-26 14:16:10 higher KDR
general 2019-09-26 14:17:17 saiga saigon
general 2019-09-26 14:17:20 same thing
general 2019-09-26 14:21:27 I always feel like that's a solution <@331490905846448129>
general 2019-09-26 14:21:49 It's definitely easier to aim in war thunder than in real tanks
general 2019-09-26 14:22:08 It's so easy to aim for weakspots with a mouse
general 2019-09-26 14:22:17 Imagine that but with a real tank
general 2019-09-26 14:22:21 Abrams will become useless
general 2019-09-26 14:22:38 That under-gun weak spot will be so exploited
general 2019-09-26 14:23:33 I remember primary school me saying I should get BC when I become eligible for credit card at 16
general 2019-09-26 14:24:31 honestly would prefer Netflix or something beneficial like skillshare nowadays

general 2019-10-27 14:03:49 230 schools are good but not elite
general 2019-10-27 14:04:07 190-200 schools are a gamble
general 2019-10-27 14:04:26 200-220 are good/meh but bad budget

general 2019-10-27 14:06:39 NCC makes you gay
general 2019-10-27 14:06:47 hands down
general 2019-10-27 14:07:00 NCC just makes you manly gay
general 2019-10-27 14:07:16 if you join NCC with no friends what's the point
general 2019-10-27 14:07:26 it's literally calmer hootler youth
general 2019-10-27 14:07:49 if yo stay in NCC despite having no friends you probably an army cocksucker
general 2019-10-27 14:08:06 NCC is a paramilitary
general 2019-10-27 14:08:11 We serve the SAF
general 2019-10-27 14:08:24 under the SAF I mean
general 2019-10-27 14:08:29 They can do anything with us

general 2019-10-27 14:08:35 Look at WW2
general 2019-10-27 14:08:44 NCC played a part in logistic
general 2019-10-27 14:08:55 NCC is 100+ year old I think
general 2019-10-27 14:09:03 it's a parent organisation
general 2019-10-27 14:09:21 idk NCC says it's NCC
general 2019-10-27 14:09:27 Parent organisation
general 2019-10-27 14:09:40 Basically same purpose as NCC land now
general 2019-10-27 14:09:59 Some Singapura officer legit told us we can be called on in war
general 2019-10-27 14:10:12 16 years old is military age
general 2019-10-27 14:10:22 So the sec 4s can die in battle yay
general 2019-10-27 14:10:52 we are not true paramilitary
general 2019-10-27 14:10:55 we legit cosplayers
general 2019-10-27 14:11:10 but sec 4s military age AND NCC is under SAF
general 2019-10-27 14:11:20 they can be called in maybe not for combat role
general 2019-10-27 14:11:32 but gotta verify
general 2019-10-27 14:11:34 that info

general 2019-10-27 14:12:17 we can make training fun or boring or jialat
general 2019-10-27 14:12:34 That's GAY
general 2019-10-27 14:12:56 UG with unfit guys gay

plane-crazy 2019-11-07 13:33:24 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 13:33:37 Switzerland used all it's points on defense and none on offense
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 13:34:08 I am Earthling

plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:02:17 <@331490905846448129> when u wanna do Armata victory day parade
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:02:55 <@614036643120152587> I build Soviet tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:03:13 <@331490905846448129> uh, let's do a conventional parade with armatas or t-72s first
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:03:37 but t-72 has to be t-72b3 variant of we want to be accurate
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:04:09 Russia doesn't use T-62s at all but they are in reserve *just in case*
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:04:29 they do use t-34s in victory parades though
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:04:39 what
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:04:51 I know
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:05:05 is it high velocity shit again <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:05:18 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:05:21 I need to make
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:05:26 on helicopers
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:05:29 helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:06:23 does it even have combat value <@331490905846448129> because most of the time combat is close range
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:06:34 and close range you would want all 12 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:06:50 what
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:06:55 far range??? <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:07:22 I think you've made a breakthrough similar to the invention of APDS
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:07:36 <@331490905846448129> how many speed 50 motors do u fit into them tho
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:08:05 APDS is first kind just before APFSDS
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 13:08:32 if we make an improvement of rotary breech then we call that an advancement into something like APFSDS irl
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:03:25 What if motor with circular base is added
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:03:29 Meaning no side welds
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:03:51 Circular/no side weld base motor would be a God send
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:04:02 Or rather a Rickje send
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:04:50 Helicopter mains would love circular base motors
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:06:15 MOc did u take a screenshot of the failed Armata parades today
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:06:32 can I see how
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:06:33 bad
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:06:40 <@456226577798135808> wrong guy
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:06:55 ok cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:07:05 we need more armatas
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:08:05 french quads are sexy
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:08:21 hmmm fms lyon
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:09:35 <@331490905846448129> do we want a special background for armata or is airport road good enough
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:11:31 MOC
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:11:38 MOc we should start making T-90Ms
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:12:03 T-90MS is export variant innit?m <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:12:11 T-90M is Russia domestic
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:12:13 variant
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:12:27 I've tried a T-90 turret but it looked too fat
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:13:33 battleships are dumb
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:13:48 why are battleships so OP in rise of nations though
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:14:29 <@331490905846448129> wait until frigates get anti ship buff because of anti ship missiles
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:14:39 actually that'll never happen
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:14:51 but one frigate should be enough to sink battleships irl
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:15:17 aircraft carriers aren't obsolete yet but they are pretty damn expensive to keep up to date
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:15:34 and modern submarines can already penetrate carrier groups
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:15:50 awww
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:16:11 what the fucker is HOF
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 14:16:19 oh

plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:12:15 that is thick
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:12:28 creamy Milo is not gay fuck you
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:13:08 you don't put Milo in plain milk right <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:13:23 We put Milo with plain water then we add condensed milk
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:13:24 WOAH
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:13:34 I need to try this Australian method
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:14:33 Greta did a hilarious job at informing our old politicians of climate change
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:15:00 no body is taking her seriously which is sad because we need our old politicians to actually know about climate change
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:15:33 Australia, yes, mining coal and stealing Timor Leste's oil when they have so much desert for solar
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:16:20 can u at least call me zoomer

plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:19:37 UK has rereererr and orderrrrrrrr
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:19:50 australia has a PM holding a lump of coal
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:20:20 malaysia is something more like a political rally centre
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:20:55 malaysia? idk man
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:21:08 but the parliament is pretty damn noisy
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:21:28 sco no???
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:21:51 idk Australian politics I just know they love oil and coal
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:22:27 after helping Timor Leste gain their independence they signed an unfair trade treaty with timor's to get their huge amount of oil
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:22:44 makes timor Leste handicapped in rebuilding
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:22:54 lol every parliament is a boomer parliament
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:23:23 I don't think Rickie will like us discussing politic in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:23:29 Australia is part of UN hello
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:23:36 everyone is
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:24:00 everyone that is not Indonesia helped Timor Leste gain indep
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:24:31 timor is a pretty big deal
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:24:43 Timor has so much fucking oil
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:24:54 Timor is so small
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:24:55 dude
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:25:05 for how small it is it has a lot of oil
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:25:15 uk they are across the Indian ocean right
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:25:29 Timor has a lot of oil in the region
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:25:38 way more easier for Australia to get
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:25:44 than from the UAE
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:26:10 qtaar is also across the indian ocean from Asia Pacific and oceania
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:27:16 Qatar has more oil but Timor has a lot of oil that is only a few hundred km away from Australia and just across the border to indonesia
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:28:46 we started with Milo politics
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:28:57 now we in australia and Timor leste
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:29:25 didn't mean to dive so deep
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:29:28 into oil
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:29:33 ok let's change topic again

plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:33:29 actually
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:33:46 plane crazy should have round base motors that don't have welds anywhere except the base
plane-crazy 2019-11-11 12:34:24 then we can spam them in a shaft 3x3 with a block wide hole without using half blocks or block 0.9

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:32:24 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:32:30 CELSIUS PLEASE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:32:43 I'm not an European
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:32:50 so give me celsius
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:33:08 why are you guys so proud of using an obsolete system
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:33:26 boiling water doesn't even have an easy point
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:08 Users of imperial can usually still get the boiling point of water wrong
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:16 What's the boiling point of water again
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:34:31 Kelvin is just a cooler version of Celsius
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:35:07 Kelvin is Celsius+273.15K
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:35:49 The argument is about temperature and this guy talking about Km/h
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:00 MPH is better than KMH tho
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:20 UK agrees that MPH is better than KMH
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:37 what HOW AM I SUPPOSED to memorise that
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:36:55 WRONG <@435946988559925248>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:02 BURMESE know how to read imperial
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:11 TRUE Burmese know how to read imperial
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:37:47 Metric was invented by the French and they saved you from Britain you better be thankful battleship
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:38:18 Imperial came from a time where EVERYONE had different units of measurements and US is still using imperial
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:38:32 There was Prussian imperial, Austian Imperial, English Imperial
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:38:36 Etc etc
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:38:56 You know US is using a full blooded British measurement, right?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:38 UK uses Imperial like it's supposed to be used, basic weighing and approximation, UK is smart
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:39:54 Because standardisation
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:40:20 They still use Imperial for only small things like measuring food or weight or long distances
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:40:37 Britain uses stones
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:40:42 Idk what the fuck is a stone
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:40:53 I weigh 5 stones or something
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:41:08 Britain uses Imperial for non academic most of the time
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:41:16 Because imperial is easier to approximate
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:41:25 But metric is better for everything else
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:41:59 Like nobody can approximate how many KG is a chicken but they can use pounds or stone
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:42:05 what's 32 kilos
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:42:22 1 stone is 6.3 KG
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:43:02 What
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:43:09 Everybody says kilos
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:43:20 what dya mean by 32
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:43:37 why did you say 32 kilos
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:43:44 What does 32 mean
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:44:05 Idk I'd Britain has done more good than harm conquering 1/4 of earth
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:44:27 Probably more harm because we have to learn one of the most inconsistent languages on Earth
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:44:52 why couldn't the Germans conquer earth, so much easier
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:44:55 Or the indonesians
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:45:22 germans i mean like colonise
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:45:31 like colonise 1/4 of the world like uj
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:45:33 Uk
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:45:40 I'd rather learn German first over English
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:46:18 Old English is probably easier to learn for stranger than modern English
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:47:10 G√µd √Üfning freonde
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:47:23 daylight savings???
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:47:54 Oh yeah you guys voted against daylight savings
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:47:59 Dumbasses
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:48:12 why would you not want more daylight saved
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:48:40 to save daylight
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:48:43 it's in the name
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:49:48 Why the hell was daylight savings invented then
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:50:05 I'm an Asian so idk how DST works so I need an Adelaider to explain
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:50:22 <@228115104061849612> Adelaide man how does DST work
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:51:23 It advances clocks so that darkness is 1 hour ahead of people's routine
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:51:29 I think that's how it works
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:51:49 Keeps people productive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:51:54 And reduces lighting costs
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:52:32 there is less time of darkness
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:52:43 Wait wrong phrasing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:53:00 But people will sleep at the same time on the clock but with dark later
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:53:03 What??
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:53:50 DST is too foreign for my asian equatorial tropical island head
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:12 singapore
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:21 literally 12 hours of sun 12 hours of dark
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:23 Perfect
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:48 what
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:49 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:54:59 only for equatorial countries
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:55:18 most of the West doesn't have 50/50 split
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:55:33 Most developed countries are wayy above the equator
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:55:37 And forgive the language
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:55:49 The countries that actually matter don't have 50/50 split time
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:56:27 Why'd you choose Ghana over Nigeria
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:57:04 Yes but Nigeria still is the India of Africa
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:57:42 by India just by populationgrowth
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:57:47 Boko Haram?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:58:18 China has electronics but India has English speakers
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:58:27 Nigeria has English speakers
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:58:39 India has a lot more English speakers than UK
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:58:47 But it's just a small fraction of India
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:59:04 Like 250 million indians
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:59:06 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:59:15 They are a commonwealth country
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:59:25 They kinda need good English
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 16:59:50 nah is fine
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:00:32 Oh yeah Nigeria
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:00:42 Official Languages include English I think
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:00:57 Just like all the former British African colonies
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:01:18 that's a lot of potential English speakers that can be useful for global employment
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:02:25 IT jobs are well paying
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:02:43 But companies can employ the "indian tech scammers" for lower pay
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:02:57 low cost employment ok yeah basically
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:03:04 but still employment
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:04:02 People outsource because people of their own nation is lazy and not willing to do certain jobs
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:04:29 Low cost employment is still employment
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:04:59 Cost of living in African countries are also generally low
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:05:03 Angola is a exception
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:05:10 an*
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:05:47 wait let me check if I said the right nation
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:06:01 Most expensive country is a country in constant civil war exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:06:17 Can't have a balanced economy and prices in a war
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:08:00 Yes I'm just saying it has high cost
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:10:03 <@322970944303923200> let's go back to blame crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:10:41 why do you always say that
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:11:02 is a place to social
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:11:25 no it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:11:35 you've said "what is the point of" like
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:11:41 ok only one time before that
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:11:48 or two
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:12:17 to social
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:12:19 It's literally
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:12:21 useless
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:12:26 but to social
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:12:39 why would you socialise in an open space
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:13:13 Are you saying you socialise in a grass field and not in a nice environment like a restaurant
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:13:17 nah it's just for show
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:13:32 and to bring in other players
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:13:38 to talk
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:14:01 the duck conveyor starts a conversation did u not see
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:14:19 it creates a topic
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:14:38 it is a still photo
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:14:44 hes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:15:02 I was about to say why so critical of something so pointless and joke
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:15:13 if is just fun
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:15:28 duck conveyor
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:15:46 actually I've eaten duck before
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:16:09 it's just chicken but with a nicer skin and only slightly different meat
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:16:36 duck farms are probably treated better than chicken farms since they are supposed to be slightly more exotic
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:16:40 less of them
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:17:01 you eat chicken right
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:17:02 Die
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:17:31 Chicken farms are definitely worse than duck farms considering it has a way higher demand for mass "production" aka killing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:17:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:18:17 not even political
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:18:18 just
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:18:26 animal abuse thinf
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:19:09 ok I stand corrected
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:20:11 <@331490905846448129> are u ever going to make a good ifv
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:20:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:21:09 duck
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:21:23 <@331490905846448129> make a conventional ifv
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:21:34 I mean like the mass production ones
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:21:48 that is not conventional
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:21:53 unless youre from chad
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:22:28 make a better bmp than mine moccer
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:22:34 like way better
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:22:44 Incorporate as much tech into small bmp
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:22:46 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:23:01 siribox
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:23:36 Swiss army is just mountain fort and nuke survival
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:23:55 Yes mountain forts
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:24:03 expandable mountain forts
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:24:14 make a mountain out of molehills
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:24:48 Switzerland doesn't need manpower to to win
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:24:56 They can just mind control Trump
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:25:12 Or xi Jin ping
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:25:26 Winnie the pooh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:25:44 Jinping the pooh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:26:27 <@331490905846448129> what's the name of the Chinese president that ranted at hong Kong journallsts
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:26:35 too simple, sometimes naive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:26:43 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:26:57 before before before him
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:27:03 the round spec
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:27:33 Jiang Zimin
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:27:36 Found it
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:28:43 
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:28:48 <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:29:37 Does your BTR have bad turning radius <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:29:48 Same same
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:30:17 tell that to the dudes in Syria praying for armoured support
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:30:31 Are you literally comparing plane crazy to real life
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:31:34 Planes have to destroy 30 T-72s to make up for money used to buy a modern attacker
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:31:57 yes they can?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:32:20 modern tanks have cameras 360 it's not ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:33:11 Which is why you aren't supposed to lose war in the air
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:33:29 You literally cant do anything on ground if you don't have even a bit of air support
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:34:03 Tanks definitely helped winnthe war, cause they decreased morale
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:34:27 Germany had the capability to almost collapse French defense lines in 1918
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:34:59 I mean they almost did
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:35:03 but they didn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:35:53 As long as ground attack isnt obsolete, tanks won't be obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:36:02 Infantry advanced with difficulty without tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:36:22 Infantry could not advance AT ALL without artillery
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:36:30 tanks revolutionised
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:37:19 Your argument is only air attack which can be countered with so many things
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:37:33 If you don't have an air force why would you even have tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:39:07 Infantry ATGMs can't penetrate tanks well unless they go around all the ERA and APS
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:39:37 Tanks literally have 1200mm RHA against heat not including ERA
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:40:32 HEAT has 1000mm
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:40:41 That's airplane ATGM
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:40:50 That's a loss in cash ACtually
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:41:04 135million for a plane and only 4 million for a tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:41:13 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:41:23 If you have it superiority but no tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:41:33 You can do anything on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:41:52 Just counter air superiority
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:42:21 SPAAG and your own air Force dude.
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:42:34 countries have air forces
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:42:52 fighters will be chasing attackers and infantry will be locking onto helicooters
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:42:56 Helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:43:19 Not entire true
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:43:32 Taliban defeated the Soviets even without an air force
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:10 If you're fighting without an air force you're probably a guerilla force tbh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:29 guys tanks are not obsolete there's just a rock paper scissors in war
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:50 air beats tank tank beats infantry infantry beats air(helicopters)
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:10 <@322970944303923200> said tank obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:18 They aren't supposed to win against plains dark
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:22 Planes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:33 Tanks are low cost and planes are fucking expensive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:19 An A-10 costs 20 million and a T-72 costs 2 million
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:37 An A-10 has to kill 10 T-72s in order to not lose money
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:50 And A-10s don't have that high of kill counts
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:01 Attackers fly very low to the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:08 They will die after a few passes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:12 over SPAAG
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:24 wrong
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:36 tanks always have infantey
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:38 infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:47 Tanks always have infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:53 Verym
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:56 very.
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:00 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:29 I'm T-72s there's a DShK meant for anti airxeaft why wouldn't it be accurate against mere humans
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:36 WHAY
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:40 WRONG
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:48 Accurate is not the same as precise
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:52 ACCURATE IS GOOS
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:01 ACCURATE IS GOOD FOR MACHINE GUN
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:08 precise is bad
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:49 panzerfaist 3 cannot kill tanks frontally especially Russian gen 3s that still has ERA
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:10 Tanks that charge are toasted
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:14 Look at Saudi Abrooms
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:33 WHY IS YOUR ONLY POINT PLANES
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:52 YOUR ONLY POINT ARE AIRPLANES THAT ARE EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:08 Caps
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:56 Planes are more important than tanks but they aren't efficient at killing tanks due to needing to fly so slow and low
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:59 Helicopters
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:53:22 Helicopters are for killing tanks efficiently not planes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:53:58 THIRD WORLDS DONT HAVE AIR FORCES TO SPEAK OF DARK
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:46 Helicopters can literally kill tanks behind hills
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:55:46 Dark has probably never heard of combined arms warfare
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:56:13 Most casualties are still caused by artillery, moc. <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:56:38 Most deaths are from artillery since humans are not killing machine
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:03 They have only one tank type because that's what an MBT is, an all rounder
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:24 You don't research tanks which is EXACTLY why you think tanks are obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:43 DARK, COMBINED ARMS WARFARE DARK
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:55 DARK!!!! COMBINED ARMS WARFARE!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:09 YOURE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT TANKS WITH PLANES!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:40 DARK YOU MAKE ME ANGRY DARK
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:59:11 DARK COMBINED ARMS WARFARE ON BOTH SIDES NEGATES AIR SUPERIORITY AND ARTILLERY
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:01 DARK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESENT NOT THE FUTURE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:10 YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:40 AAA is not perfect but they will kill attackers in droves
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:52 Just loonat Afghanistan Dark
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:02 Look at Afghanistan
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:18 Taliban is literally just infantry and tanks but they can defeat airforce
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:26 With AAA
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:54 Yes but Soviets had air superiority and lost that's your point.
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:22 Taliban fought conventionally as well
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:32 They were once the rulers of an entire country
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:47 Aircraft don't win wars they assist in winning wars
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:57 DARK WE ARENT TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:12 WE ARENT TALKINF ABOUT THE FUTURE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:17 TANKS NOW, NOW
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:20 Are not obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:33 Tanks might be obsolete in the future but not now
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:53 We were talking about the present the Entire damn time Dark
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:16 You literally said yourself you were talking about modern not future
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:36 Are you basing this all on Lindybeige?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:22 He dis
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:25 He did
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:34 Helicopters were far more effective than attack airplanes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:50 The A-10 is surprisingly ineffective for how much it costs
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:41 <@210141202698338304> dark was saying tanks are and will be obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:46 that's what
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:58 Dark you know Armour of some form will exist forever.
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:04 Armour will be counted as tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:12 There'll just be a new form of armour
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:28 <@210141202698338304> suspension fuses for missiles
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:07:48 Armour will never go obsolete and tanks are the embodiment of armor
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:08:27 even in 1950 when armor was useless against such powerful ammo, tanks weren't obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:09:01 There'll just be a reinvention of composite armor and tanks will remain in favour
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:09:27 Tanks will forever evolve in ways we won't see
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:09:52 Tanks won't be replaced it'll just be improved and adapted
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:10:20 Horses became cars
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:10:26 cars became tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:10:37 Tanks becomes better tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:11:36 Ok dark do you at least agree that armour will be a thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:11:45 If you agree armour will remain a thing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:11:52 You also agree with our point
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:12:03 Because armor's counter is planes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:12:27 Armour's counter are air units
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:13:12 Dark, planes aren't as tidal as you think they are, they just slow down tank movement because CAS is highly inefficient even today
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:14:52 Dark you're not looking at the larger picture
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:15:18 CAS will be obliterated by AAA the enemy doesn't need an airforce
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:15:40 CAS can still kill but AAA nowadays is dangerously precise
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:16:21 tanks being protected by AAA already nullifies the effects planes have on tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:16:34 Planes also don't destroy tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:16:40 They just slow tanks down
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:16:55 CAS is already proven to be ineffective against tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:17:49 Bro the A-10 is already getting replaces
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:18:06 The A-10 and Su-35 are already getting replaces bro
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:18:09 Attackers are obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:18:37 Why aren't attackers obsolete to you, Dark?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:03 attackers are specifically for attacking tanks but are getting obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:09 bombers are also obselete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:12 obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:40 All bombers of countries have been phased out of service except those lucky enough to be modernised
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:52 Argentina is not a third sorld
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:19:55 World
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:20:31 Bombers are useless they are too expensive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:20:39 Dark you aren't seeing the costs of planes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:20:52 Planes are stupid fucking expensive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:21:15 Tanks only 1 million and a bit more oil then your average oil eating pick up
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:21:22 I don't worship the tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:21:28 The tank is just not obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:22:09 Bombers are only being used against third worlds, in a real environment they would get shot down immediately
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:22:49 Why would you sacrifice an F-35 for just maybe 3 T-72s or Type 96s?
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:23:35 Drones aren't do killing tanks they are just general purpose attack
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:23:39 for*
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:23:58 they will develop though but be even more expensive
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:24:24 Are you actually talking about the small chance of auto aim function
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:24:35 failure
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:24:51 bro it's 2:24 here
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:25:29 My lap top no working and the desk top is in the middle of the living room next to parents room <@331490905846448129>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:26:07 Imagine suicide vests in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:26:15 okay no
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:26:32 Imagine body welds in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:26:40 Then welding TNT to yourself
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:26:42 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:27:07 There are already suicide noob cars
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:27:27 I want to delete my Armata is obsolete
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:28:35 lol death cars don't have armor they can't handle 12 rockets coming at them
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:29:32 Planes are only effective in plane crazy due to it being a video game with free look
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:30:06 Hardest part of attacking in plane is visibility and estimation
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:30:10 Is why helicopter is good
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:30:55 I will cherish this forever zook
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:09 show the tnt stats  <@210141202698338304>

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:35:11 ok yeah
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:35:19 but not in the near future
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:35:52 Assad still has to settle deal with Kurds I guess
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:37:14 ACHTUNG VIDEO NICHT VERF√úGBAR
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:38:01 city and urban

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:17:11 Spy watch was duped thousand times over
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:17:27 It's for novelty and actual spying and not for bounty hunting

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:25:32 We can make gun art with gun keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:25:51 why do we get only 10 guns but also get 12 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:25:54 No making sense
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:26:15 guns are weaker
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:26:36 how are you going to squeeze the dragon into the plot
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:27:31 I wonder how people came up with the idea of dragons existing
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:27:37 Would it be they discovered dinosaurs
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:27:48 dinosaur fossil

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:31:08 Challenger 2 still sexy but still looks default
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:31:22 Chinese tank looks even more default
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:32:06 u know TNT is armor right
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:32:41 <@331490905846448129> snetry needs modern MBTs

plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:35:48 I'm going to miss Russian bowl turret
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:36:00 T-72 can still be good if they update fire control
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:36:16 you don't need armor if u don't get spotted shooting at enemy
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 11:36:27 good thermals

plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:56:59 guys would an ekranoplan count as aviation or nautical
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:57:17 come on..
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:57:32 I can't get shipwright+aeronautical roles with an ekranoplan
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:57:35 that's a hack
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:57:38 no way
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:58:01 a flying boat would be aviation
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:58:10 but a boat flying is nautical??
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:58:21 an ekranoplan is a boat flying
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:58:47 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:59:04 ekranoplans just hover over water at high speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:59:08 but mine can fly
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 11:59:20 but better bound on large expanses of water
plane-crazy 2019-12-11 12:00:11 Cool I can just extend the wings and then I'd get aeronautical
