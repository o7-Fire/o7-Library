plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:05:36 i only have about 600 left
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:05:46 folding is cringe
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:06:24 im planning to make it look like a big wedge with weapons on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:06:34 how am i meant to do that with 600 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:07:16 stop with the god damn folding im going to run out of blocks either way
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:07:24 i am
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:08:25 why do i need folding if the entire build fits in my plot
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:09:16 if a make it longer turning will be harder, even more lag and it'll probably look dumb
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:09:41 but i already went through all the trouble making the legs-
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:10:19 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:10:48 thats the point
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:11:08 nope
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:11:22 it can loose half of its legs and can still walk
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:11:39 ive tested
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:12:00 i just chose 8 legs since more legs = more stability
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:12:45 ig ill make the interior hollow
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:13:10 how many arms do you even have on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 05:13:52 yeah most builds can last as long if half or more is still on
