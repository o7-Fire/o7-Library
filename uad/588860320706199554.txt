bug-reports 2020-10-12 19:38:14 For some reason whenever I try to cross the railway in my tank, it always seems to flip over and get stuck by this tiny little bit
bug-reports 2020-10-12 19:38:39 Flipping doesn't work either as it just stays there

creations-chat 2021-02-21 17:25:47 *attempting to make the Bastion from war robots currently*

The shield does move like how the actual Bastion did in it's teaser trailer, but it's a-bit glitchy sometimes since that the two physical shields are two separate halves, unlike the Raijin however.

And here's a video of the shield functioning: https://streamable.com/vs87v1
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 18:16:10 *of course that my war robots bastion has to be cursed with the number 666*
