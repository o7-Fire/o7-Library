general 2023-06-03 19:30:50 how do I make fireworks fire rapidly
general 2023-06-03 19:31:05 theres someone in my server with fireworks firing faster than a goddamn machine gun
general 2023-06-03 19:31:49 that does nothing
general 2023-06-03 19:31:53 fireworks have a cooldown
general 2023-06-03 20:13:34 how would that increase firerate
general 2023-06-03 20:13:40 oh
general 2023-06-05 10:55:03 How do I get image access
creations-chat 2023-06-05 10:57:10 yo how do I get image perms
general 2023-06-05 11:02:44 send me a message link its lost in the walls of text
general 2023-06-05 11:03:32 nvm found it
bot-central 2023-06-05 11:03:40 !rank
general 2023-06-05 11:32:17 I said walls of text not the channels
general 2023-06-05 11:32:25 theres like 200 messages inside <#925522972586967092>
general 2023-06-24 15:04:54 yo guys what does blast pressure in explosive blocks do
general 2023-06-24 15:06:26 ok but what does it do
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:59:23 Anyone know how I can reduce lag in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-27 23:59:29 the game is laggy af
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:00:33 no actually
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:01:20 I cant spawn a small fighter jet without my fps dropping to 30
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:01:39 and I run an rtx 3060 and ryzen 9 5900 so I know it isnt my computer
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:02:47 I still run a ryzen 9 5900hs
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:02:59 I can play games like war thunder with 0 problem
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:03:26 I play pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:03:59 whats wrong with playing pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:04:01 its fun
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:04:31 anyways is there a way I can fix it or reduce it
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:04:55 and my fps only drops once I spawn in
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:05:26 my fps averages above 120 when im in build mode and drops down to 30 frames when i spawn in
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:05:34 and my build is only 700 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:06:47 yeah I use pistons for my hover drives
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:06:50 do they cause lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:07:53 my fps averages around 40 or 50 when I'm in a very low block count server or near empty server
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:08:05 doesnt get any higher than that unless I just dont spawn in
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:09:48 conveyor drives are horrible for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:09:56 let me check one sec
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:11:00 7 pistons
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:11:22 every plane I have lags
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:11:30 my helicopter lags too but not as much
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:12:14 fps stays at 140+
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:12:51 ever since I got experience in building and started building planes with motor locks and more advanced techniques my fps has degraded
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:13:03 so like 1 or 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:13:05 it started
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:13:16 10
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:13:22 lowering it doesnt fix anything
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:13:29 it just lowers my visibility
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:14:26 it happens on another roblox game but said game has a shit ton of mechanics and things that would obviously cause lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:14:39 so really its only plane crazy where it lags but it shouldn't lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:14:45 blackhawk rescue mission 5
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:15:08 every other roblox game I've played is fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:15:10 its only pc
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:15:30 same
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:15:36 over time updates made it laggier though
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:16:16 they added weather
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:16:57 weather and some of the map additions has made the game laggier
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:17:04 such as the fact that trees sway now
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:17:11 and some other gfx stuff
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:17:47 anyway are the pistons the reason why Im experiencing lag
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:17:51 or the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:18:05 do private servers have stuff that regular servers dont
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:18:37 I've been in near-empty servers or servers with builds that dont have much blocks at all
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:18:47 and my fps increases up to 50 or 60 but no higher
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:18:50 and I use an fps unlocker
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:19:15 as I said I have a 3060
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:19:19 and a 9 5900hs
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:19:39 wait nvm I read that wrong
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:20:17 fps unlockers dont boost fps
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:20:58 like reduce frames?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:21:32 damn
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:21:49 hold on I'ma deactivate my fps unlocker and rejoin my server
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:21:51 and see if it helps
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:24:31 is RCO an exception?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:24:44 because theres a ton of code that optimizes roblox alongside its fps unlocking
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:26:29 the graphics bar on rco is multiplied by 2
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:26:33 so instead of 10 bars its 20
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:26:46 doesnt boost graphics but it just gives more gfx options
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:26:58 20 bars is equal to 10 bars
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:27:11 its just multiplied but it doesnt actually change anything
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:27:43 im loading in
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:28:30 it definitely boosted my fps in normal servers
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:29:01 it boosted my fps by like 10 or 20 frames in the first pvp server I joined
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:29:15 ima join another server to make sure its not a fluke
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:31:12 wtf
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:31:12 holy shit
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:31:26 I loaded in my f14 that always makes me go down to 10 frames
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:31:37 and my fps averages like 30+ when I have it spawned now
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:32:58 yeah it was definitely the fps unlockers fault
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:33:12 I loaded in a warship thats like 4000 blocks and my frames stayed above 30 fps
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:33:15 when in the water
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 00:33:35 thank you

plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:28:20 honestly I prefer gameplay over detail
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:28:44 and if I were to shove any more motorlocks in my planes to make them look better then plane crazy would be practically unplayable for me
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:29:29 I sent the images in a reply
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:29:44 you can look at the reply and see my conversation regarding how laggy my pc experience is
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:30:38 I dont know why plane crazy is laggy when every other game isnt
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:31:47 prob because of roblox physics engine being shit but other than that its a needle in the hay stack
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:37:17 I didnt use anything other than rco
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:38:07 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 02:38:58 send me a download link in dms for shadowplay

plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:02:30 medal may be a resource hog but at least I can actually upload the videos I save there
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:03:35 I recorded a less than 40 second long clip of me flying around in my mig in plane crazy and the file size was too big
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:03:42 prob less than 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:04:13 medal is a recording software
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:04:30 I use it as a recording software
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:40:45 btw
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 03:40:57 Is razer cortex worth using
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:27:48 I hope it isnt laggy asf
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:27:57 and better optimization
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:28:27 both
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 04:29:13 I shouldnt need an RTX to run a <1000 block build at tolerable fps levels

general 2023-07-01 21:09:53 you clearly arent making them correctly them

plane-crazy 2023-07-01 22:33:56 motor hat isnt a face
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 22:36:39 what
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 22:47:54 I have a motor hat on
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 22:47:59 it doesnt look better
plane-crazy 2023-07-01 22:48:01 at all
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:25:42 blame how small pc plots are
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:27:45 the helicopter itself takes up more than 70% of the plot length
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:30:18 Also the AH-1Z model that I used for the build is practically the same length of my heli so idk what youre on about
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:33:36 if youre gonna shit on random people because their build isnt as perfect as you want it to be then I'd like to see you build a better ah-1z in the same 3 hours that I spent building mine
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:43:10 You need 2 rotors on top of eachother, one to provide lift for the helicopter and one to counter the torque of the main rotor
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:46:26 this is what I do but theres also another way to stop your heli from spinning by adding a tail rotor (which is very vulnerable in pvp) to counter the torque and also provide horizontal stabilization and movement of the tail of the helicopter
creations-chat 2023-07-02 15:48:54 This is what I use on my heli

I can also link a helicopter basics video if it will let me

If your helicopter is decently long or heavy then I recommend putting 2 of these co-ax rotors on the far ends of the center of gravity on your vehicle so its easy to control
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:18:17 Tandem rotor
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:20:29 its changing direction because the heli is too light

I recommend changing the materials to metal which is more durable in pvp and heavier, or removing helium blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-02 16:26:11 <@982238041445900348> 

this can also be because your helicopter is unfinished and just very small so I recommend building the helicopter itself THEN adding the rotor where it needs to be added

the center of gravity constantly changes whenever you add a block on to your build so its much better to finish your build first and then add the rotors
creations-chat 2023-07-02 19:02:11 oh mb
creations-chat 2023-07-02 19:04:58 what
creations-chat 2023-07-02 19:19:31 no like wdym by viper
creations-chat 2023-07-02 20:24:23 a box
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:19:57 yo
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:20:19 Whenever I press the key for my disconnectors to disconnect, they dont disconnect
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:20:24 does anyone know why
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:20:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:20:52 same thing happens to my trap doors on 1 build
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:20:56 they dont open/close
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:21:12 what is happening
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:21:40 thanks
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:22:33 powering/unpowering disconnecters doesnt do anything right
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:22:48 what does it do
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 21:23:17 I have a bunch of unpowered disconnectors on another build of mine and they disconnect properly
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:14:42 Can someone help on what to do here?

I'm making an aircraft carrier but I don't think I will have enough space to install the superstructure. I set up a pole to measure the plot height limit and it appears that I'm reaching the top of the plot

I can't stop building more layers because when the build is unfolded, it appears to be very short and obviously requires more length

I also put an image of the reference im using for my build
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:16:56 ignore the fact that the runway is inverted and on the opposite side
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:19:16 actually though what do I do in that situation

there is a very high chance I wont be able to fit in the superstructure
creations-chat 2023-07-02 22:22:35 I'll try motorlocking the superstructure
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:04:32 since rebuilding the entire build would have more downsides than upsides at this point and there isnt enough space for motorlocking I'll try to integrate the superstructure into the hull of the ship
creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:52:53 Where is the ah-1z you said you would complete 9 hours ago

creations-chat 2023-07-03 00:23:08 Eskeline try not to shit on peoples build if he cant make a better build himself (failed in 2 fucking seconds)

creations-chat 2023-07-03 00:27:50 If you cant even make a small attack helicopter in 3 hours you arent in any place to be shit talking people
creations-chat 2023-07-03 00:29:54 Sounds like a skill issue tbh
creations-chat 2023-07-03 01:08:52 mans cant even make an interior

also what helicopter is that
creations-chat 2023-07-03 01:11:42 sorry I dont spend my life studying helicopters so I dont know off the top of my head what an uncolored russian-looking vehicle is supposed to be

also how long did it take you to build that
creations-chat 2023-07-03 01:14:14 what

creations-chat 2023-07-03 02:42:42 guys what should I add to this besides markings and a superstructure
creations-chat 2023-07-03 02:45:26 actually
creations-chat 2023-07-03 03:57:43 I use disconnectors

yes I know it looks like horseshit but I dont care about it that much
creations-chat 2023-07-03 04:13:54 piston and motorlock can be very laggy so I just use disconnectors
creations-chat 2023-07-03 04:18:50 angle locks are pretty unnecessary if youre just trying to paint the deck

If I make the motor locks any smaller or more space efficient than they already are then I would not be able to make my aircraft carrier pvp-capable or have some of the features it has on it atm

said features include having a 1:1 scale superstructure and some of the markings it has on

I own an aircraft carrier with 4 sections, all using anchor blocks to hold themselves together while spawned in, as well as a functioning catapult system

The problem is that I need physics to be turned on in order for the catapult to work, otherwise I have to quickly unlock the anchors, activate the catapult, and lock them again.

The problem with physics mode is that its extremely buggy and does not function when more than 2 blocks from another persons vehicle is on the carrier, but if I do the other method where I quickly unlock anchors, the carrier has a tendency to freak out when I do that.

Is there a way I can fix this bug?

overall your build looks great though

bug-reports 2023-07-06 02:08:44 whenever I load in my unfinished B-52 stratofortress in plane crazy and try to accelerate it, the motor folding begins to shake uncontrollably and completely break the entire build.
This happens every time I try to move it, locked motors or not. It gets worse when I'm in a public server or am lagging an excessive amount

Debug menu screenshot:
https://i.gyazo.com/d586c028746f73722140ff38f45044cc.png

The bug happens specifically on my B-52, which is over 3000 blocks and causes tolerable lag increase when spawned in and/or unanchored, so it is likely that it can be reproduced via spawning in a large build that uses wing folding including motors and wing panels.

https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/1hWiXGknTWagyy/d1337FDfWCZ3?invite=cr-MSxrZkYsMTYyNjg1ODE0LA

Note: *In the video, the larger parts of the wings have unlocked motors, as well as the motors connecting the main airframe. This is because locking the motors seemingly do not help at all, and only prevent it from breaking apart __in my private server__. The wingtip folds are locked, however, as they seemingly worsen when the motors are unlocked.*

creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:46:50 plane crazy's shitty ass optimization makes it lag whenever I use ANY other engine that isn't either a magnet engine or conveyor

the downsides of using those 2 engines is they are shit for use on bomber/heavy aircraft
creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:49:57 I have the engine set to a configuration where the max speed is 900 sps

the thing is that I have to hold down the button for accelerating in order to maintain speed, making landing and pvp unrealistic to even think of doing
creations-chat 2023-07-07 01:53:34 anyway should I keep trying or should I start from scratch and make something smaller

creations-chat 2023-07-12 16:53:40 I recommend motorlocking the cockpit window so you can add more detail to it

here's an example
https://i.gyazo.com/0a547bb3c32088ac8350072146b277bc.png
creations-chat 2023-07-12 16:55:44 in that case try to make the cockpit blend more with the airframe of the helicopter so it fits flush and doesnt look so blocky

e.g use half blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 19:58:06 looks good
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:03:56 pretty good ngl
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:24:57 is the plane done?
what type of aircraft is it? what you should add to it depends on its main role

bomber or fighter? <@396515096693833729>
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:28:13 add some sort of vertical stabilizer so that it will maneuver well in combat
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:30:54 can it perform an instantaneous 9g turn in less than 5 seconds

if it can't then I recommend making the stabilizer bigger and adjusting the control surfaces' sensitivity as you will most likely be doing that alot while dogfighting in pvp
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:33:27 an instant 9g turn is when you roll the aircraft 90 degrees to the left or right and turn to either side using only your elevators
creations-chat 2023-07-12 20:35:36 <@396515096693833729> this is an instantaneous 9g turn

having to perform a maneuver like this in combat, especially in dogfighting is practically guaranteed
