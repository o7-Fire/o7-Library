bug-reports 2021-06-17 08:58:46 BUG: blacklist doesnt work against parachutes. So basically, i joined a game, and on my plot there were already a bunch of unattached parachutes. i tried to blacklist the dude who placed them there but the parachutes didnt go away
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:00:06 yeah i did
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:01:47 lag
bug-reports 2021-06-17 09:02:13 there were a lot of them, covering the entire plot
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:02:18 pretty sure its a ping issue or something like that, might be wrong though
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:04:11 yes i know, it has happened to me as well
bug-reports 2021-06-18 05:04:37 well, if it isnt ping then i have no idea

general 2023-06-25 17:40:57 i mean commanders could spot things and plan attacks and whatnot i guess, but sounds more like an rp thing
general 2023-06-25 17:41:33 you mourn and cry
general 2023-06-25 17:41:39 and then you keep playing
general 2023-06-25 17:43:58 it still exists, but nobody plays it, i remember it too, it was awesome, for me it's up there with work at a pizza place in terms of nostalgia
general 2023-06-25 17:45:27 treading on those who tread on you 💯 (i dont know what im talking about)

general 2023-06-25 17:48:14 you want to combine builds from 2 separate saves in plane crazy?
general 2023-06-25 17:48:29 not possible sadly
general 2023-06-25 17:49:58 that sounds possible, since there is collision between the builds of different players i think
general 2023-06-25 17:50:21 you would have to be very precise though
general 2023-06-25 17:51:17 GET OUT OF MY HEAD
general 2023-06-25 17:51:34 slavery.
general 2023-06-25 17:52:35 yeah, it kinda cooled down though
