help 2023-01-02 00:20:47 Wait so if you already bought assets like Speakers, will you somehow get them in Plane Crazy 2? Dont wanna buy again
help 2023-01-02 00:31:17 Hopefully he does that
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:20:32 Does the Center of mass affect the *entire* build, even parts like rockets that are disconnected
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:21:16 Because I make a missile carrier and the rockets go like ⤴️ ◀️ ⤵️
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:21:25 Bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:22:15 Why would they do this, it’s fine stand alone, but with a  big vehicle they fly badly
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:22:47 That’s why I’m asking lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:24:08 I’m just saying that the rockets fly in a goofy way when it’s carried by a vehicle (then disconnected) but the rocket alone flies fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 11:25:41 Goddman my goofy I didn’t ask before I was at my pc

help 2023-02-23 04:21:02 Why rocket not fall after disconnection 🤔 😱 😔
help 2023-02-23 04:21:46 falls without thrusters tho
help 2023-02-23 21:22:04 No anchor block
help 2023-02-24 10:12:54 Damn that sucks

Now that I think about it, it might be because of the rotation of the disconnectors. I think the stick becomes kinematic
general 2023-02-24 10:14:19 The X, Y, Z of your pillow and the Euler angles also
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:02:36 This is the best thing ive ever seen
