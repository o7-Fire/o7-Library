plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:23:04 or make there be 2 motor on the wheels
make it so the top left wheel turns when press a or w (or other way round idk)
and top right d or w ( or other way round)
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:23:38 no thats such a bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:24:15 no it will make the car drift
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:24:21 and the handling will be really bad
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:26:00 yh thats what i tried explaining
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:28:26 Top right wheel -
motor1 - W and S
motor2 - A and D

Top left wheel 
motor1 - S and W 
motor2 - D and A

Bottom left wheel
motor1- S and W
motor2- A and D

Bottom right wheel
motor1 - W and S
motor2 - A and D
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:28:42 you could do that ^^ but you would need 2 motors on each wheel
