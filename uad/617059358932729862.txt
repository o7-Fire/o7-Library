general 2020-01-15 18:58:57 guys

general 2020-01-15 18:59:57 like either 1 block in the middle is hollow or everything is hollow
general 2020-01-15 19:00:08 hollow cylinder?
general 2020-01-15 19:00:24 that isnt a thing?
general 2020-01-15 19:00:36 yeah
general 2020-01-15 19:00:40 it would be cool if it was
general 2020-01-15 19:00:47 i could create my road roller if it was
general 2020-01-15 19:00:56 and it wouldnt look fat
general 2020-01-15 19:01:05 hi stardust crusader
general 2020-01-15 19:01:28 slav
general 2020-01-15 19:01:39 omg
general 2020-01-15 19:01:41 i just got an idea
general 2020-01-15 19:01:51 like a road roller
general 2020-01-15 19:02:03 but its rollers are made of tracls
general 2020-01-15 19:02:05 tracks
general 2020-01-15 19:02:09 it could actually work
general 2020-01-15 19:02:16 no joke
general 2021-02-13 01:46:47 Alright guys, its 2:42 am and my brain finally activated, is there a way for me to make a "walker" more like a russian walking excavator using a motor, cylinder and the power of rotation? The plan is to make a thing that trains have on their wheels like the stick that moves along with a wheel and rotates another(i think) and then connect it in a way that pushes the leg forward and then the leg pushes backwards while the other leg goes forward and repeat (jesus christ i've lost track of what i've been trying to say)
general 2021-02-13 01:47:23 Bruh now i realised i was writing in the wrong channel
