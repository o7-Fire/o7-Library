creations-chat 2021-07-25 01:01:15 It's just for detailing I guess. I could change it. It's not supposed to be a traditional fighter, It's for the contest.
creations-chat 2021-07-26 17:59:11 This is nothing new. PCC is basically a different parallel dimension.

general 2021-09-07 21:37:52 Absolutely, alot of planes have them actually
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 01:33:07 Yo. Maybe someone will finally be able to make a good F-22 or F-35 in PC2 <:dumbconfusion:757965389245448293>
creations-chat 2021-10-10 17:59:42 Have you seen the berkut?

Some of the 6th generation fighter concepts look crazier than that.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:18:21 Lol. Sorry.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:20:25 ^^^^^^^^
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:26:28 Every single angle is necessary. Suck it up buttercup.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:28:38 It's a micro build. And you're not the entire community. The opinion of one is not equal to the opinion of many
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:30:47 That F-18 basic af.

For the record it does look good. But still

creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:40:00 ~~simply a difference in skill~~

creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:47:10 Imagine comparing a large ship to a micro build fighter.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:51:25 I spent half the day building and redesigning
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:53:27 I'll be redesigning and remaking it. I'll repost it once I do. It's more of a prototype than anything
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:55:30 The wedges or the disconnectors?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 03:58:34 Got it
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:48:34 I finished remodeling the F/A-39
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:00:23 Before and after.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:02:22 It's three images bro.
creations-chat 2021-10-23 07:14:28 What's with those wing parts sticking out?
creations-chat 2021-10-23 08:03:47 What I was saying is it'd look better if it was seamless instead of having that small 1x2 half wedge shape gap there
creations-chat 2021-10-24 21:00:28 Looks great. Missiles look kinda lack luster tho

creations-chat 2021-12-02 02:46:35 There's been some really good builds today ngl
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:46:15 I dunno about you guys but I build for fun...
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:52:42 I used to be like that...
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:54:44 In the next millennia unfortunately.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:03:17 Bro. I've experimented and practiced angle locking for months and I still have no idea what I'm doing...

Motorlocking superiority
creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:05:31 Haha. Thanks. Maybe one day. I can motorlock like a beast tho

Maybe not make a circular motor good, but I'm skilled
creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:07:32 By skilled I mean I can use less motor lock than needed.

And still get the same results
creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:10:01 Something like this?

creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:28:12 It's called plane crazy for a reason ig...
creations-chat 2021-12-14 07:30:34 I mean... People post ALOT of things that aren't aircraft...
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:11:49 Basically it's just motor locking while also using motors to angle a part(s) at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:13:50 I told him already
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:15:01 Trails
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:15:46 Yes,
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:16:08 Or you can do it with like three motor lock tower segments
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:16:13 and angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:16:32 but that's just me
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:16:47 I'm really good at making things compact
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:17:16 It was a self-proclaimed accolade. Need I show you anything?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:17:43 I don't have to prove anything to ***you***
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:18:02 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:18:15 *Anyways*

plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:19:03 Its not meant to be flashy
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:19:11 I have flashier builds
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:19:33 Aight
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:22:11 Not the most insane, but flashier. I deleted all my other builds (and their photos) because they were... *lacking* in the skill department. I just recently started playing again
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:22:26 dont mind the uncropped images
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:22:51 All of them do
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:21 bottom two photos are the same jet, the top one is a different one.
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:32 Same series of jets
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:37 but dif
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:40 and yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:48 they're currently my only flashy jets
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:23:58 I dont play PC much anymore
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:24:10 and deleted all my other jets

plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:26:50 I know
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:27:01 the rumor is defo cap tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:27:50 I would like to believe rickje would give us an ACTUAL sneak-peak or two before PC2 releases. But that's probably my endless optimism talking
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:28:11 Dang bro, you living in the past
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:28:22 ***fUtUrE tO tHe bAcK***
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:28:46 isnt he ***THE*** development tho?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:29:09 ah
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:29:14 that explains it
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:29:32 Honestly
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:29:38 idrc if it releases later than sooner
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:29:46 More polished game = less lag and more fun
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:30:39 I just can wait until we get scale-able part
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:30:54 i can finna make myself a 1x2 half-wedge corner
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:31:03 and all the other corners
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:31:14 Ew
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:31:24 what he said
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:32:00 map is infinite
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:32:43 nah, he said they optimized it enough that the terrain (land, buildings, and water included) is randomly generated infinitely
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:32:55 i dont know if its client side or not tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:32:59 could pose a problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:33:07 but that's just my coding experience talking
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:33:14 I still need to learn lua...
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:33:17 T_T
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:33:24 it does
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:33:33 on god?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:34:00 you're slightly right, but also mostly wrong
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:39:12 YO
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:39:28 it would be cool if we could merge builds
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:39:30 like
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:39:42 spawn a build into another build
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:39:56 pretty sure that's happening
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 07:40:09 oof
