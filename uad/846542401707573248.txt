the-dump 2022-04-02 20:34:10 Alcohol is not HALAL....Other countries including the UAE permit the selling of Alcholic Beverages--as I guess a religion can't define a country in its entirety....so for Muslims...It is forbidden....However tourists choose as they please.....so Indonesia and many other Muslim-majority countries **DO** sell alchohol.
