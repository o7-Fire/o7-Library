creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:07:33 this is some real biased stuff
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:10:54 why was my batwing treated so harshly?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:14:36 I think you're just a little bit jelly
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:16:47 that is literally how it's supposed to be designed
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:17:28 blocky?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:18:30 you must have very high standards and have the building skills of god
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:19:53 well i don't care if you think it looks bad anyway
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:20:16 I think it looks good, my friends thinks it looks good, i've not ran into anyone in game who thinks it looks bad and that's good enough for me
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:21:34 I don't get the short part
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:21:54 how so?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:22:18 well you know batman
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:07 <@456226577798135808>
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:18 
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:32 i took inspiration from this one
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:42 and just build it in my own way
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:24:36 it's hard to make something completely smooth
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:24:56 plus i wanted some points on it too cause it's a batman vehicle
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:25:12 i can see what you mean
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:25:18 i can't tell the difference between both pictures
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:27:42 also if i could i would have done it without that sort of blocky part under the wings but this thing is really heavy and needs a lot of power
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:27:50 so I will take that as a fair point
general 2020-06-02 18:29:42 bro if you want to have a good time just bake a big sweet potato then eat from it with a fork
general 2020-06-02 18:30:16 preferably a plastic one
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:31:53 is there actually a way to make water not flood the entire submarine?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:32:39 wish roblox would add the option to just not use their ancient dead programming language and use unity or the unreal engine or something
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:34:17 
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:34:18 
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:34:43 anyone else get that problem where the propellers just fall off?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:38:16 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:43:27 you could counter that by just adding a ton of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:05 think of one time where rockets didn't solve a countries problem
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:10 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:45:06 try adding rockets on the bottom to make it go up and just keep tinkering with it to hit that sweet spot
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:46:51 and places on the inside you can hide them?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:00 any*
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:49:40 what if instead you put propellers in side those things and used a magnet engine or conveyor engine to make it go forward
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:51:14 i tried it on my batwing and well it didn't lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:51:18 but it did go crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:52:02 why not just put the wings inside those block container things?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:22:32 what about a hover thruster engine?
the-dump 2020-06-07 03:48:35 
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:36:09 
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:37:15 it's a man
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:38:07 i mean if you think it's attractive, you do you
general 2020-06-15 15:57:59 I don't need to put it in the dump if others dont and it isnt enforced
general 2020-06-15 15:58:15 Well scroll up
