plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:48:22 like its completely working properly the way it should
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:49:03 here i am trying to build intense motorlocked tomcat though i only played pc for a week
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:49:56 tutorial and using showcase as a extra reference is different right xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:50:43 motorlocking is the first thing i tried to learn when i started bc i feel like im gonna need it alot
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:51:48 does plane folding require anchors on each fold?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:52:45 in still confused how are they able to fold planes like the weight of each fold but i already know how they build the motor setup for folding
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:53:09 make sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:53:24 they stack?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:53:41 ok

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:56:00 and it ended up spinning without me knowing why
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:57:42 my first day was just me building a turret that i spammed with guns and missile it cant even be controlled by mouse that i have to rotate it with keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 14:58:44 imma head out and feed plane crazy some of my braincells or maybe not just some
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:00:13 pretty sure u can still revive it many pc ytbers have cringe contents on their old vid

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:03:01 motors is the first thing i learnt xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:04:04 if ur boat is small try using control surfaces

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:06:58 wedges hurts my brain more than motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:07:50 meh just think like its ok for it to look bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:10:00 do tutorials until u get good

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:13:11 bruh literally every pvp server i join on theres always this one guy that will block everyone and use his turret
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:14:05 bombs can't go through block plots sadly
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:15:10 <:LagBomb:568630816121290753>

help 2021-08-23 19:34:07 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:35:42 they should be connected to the anchor or to the blocks that is connected on the anchor

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 19:37:24 also they need to add hall of lame for shredder users
help 2021-08-24 18:18:48 can we use propeller blades for the aeronautical engineer rank?
help 2021-08-24 18:21:03 kk
help 2021-08-24 18:21:18 ty
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 18:21:52 say it kindly
help 2021-08-24 18:22:39 looks a little chonky
help 2021-08-24 18:23:04 build the other parts first before u change size tho
help 2021-08-24 18:23:21 u can have better look when other part is done
help 2021-08-24 18:25:42 u can improve ur modeling skills if u kept doing tutorials or keep building jets
help 2021-08-24 18:26:25 how do i fix the rubbish back?
help 2021-08-24 18:27:31 dont use 2x2 on all jets tho some jet use 1x1
help 2021-08-24 18:28:25 didn't notice
help 2021-08-24 18:29:06 is mirrage actually a big plane or the mirrage i saw is just oversized
help 2021-08-24 18:29:15 i saw mirrage with 2 fuselage fold
help 2021-08-24 18:29:39 and what kind of plane
help 2021-08-24 18:29:50 like passenger plane biplane or just tryna make jet
help 2021-08-24 18:30:33 start with nose its easier but if u feel more confident doing other parts first then go
help 2021-08-24 18:31:50 like this
Half blocks -> |
Half Wedge -> \
help 2021-08-24 18:31:58 then half blocks
help 2021-08-24 18:32:01 and repeat
help 2021-08-24 18:32:08 to other side
help 2021-08-24 18:32:38 do some jets tutorial first i guess it also helps u make jets better
help 2021-08-24 18:33:04 the one on half block i mostly used
help 2021-08-24 18:33:43 i only did like 4 or 5 jet tutorial and came up with this overbuilt mig 21
help 2021-08-24 18:34:55 also try to learn stuff abt motors and locks as much as u can u will need them on building jets for small details or if u dont have enough spqce
help 2021-08-24 18:35:29 ^
help 2021-08-24 18:35:35 i see
help 2021-08-24 18:36:51 he mean like instead of train wheel he use 1x0.9
help 2021-08-24 18:36:56 am i right
help 2021-08-24 18:38:15 conveyor --> ◼️
1x0.9 blocks ---> ◻️
help 2021-08-24 18:38:20 like that
help 2021-08-24 18:39:02 just like train wheel but conveyor is the cylinder and the 1x0.9 block is the circle connector to cylinder
help 2021-08-24 18:39:31 make it small but make sure theres 1 block space inside
help 2021-08-24 18:39:44 so u can add rocket engines inside it
help 2021-08-24 18:40:08 inside fuselage there should be a long space that is 1 block high
help 2021-08-24 18:42:38 i lost my rickroll free nitro link :(

help 2021-08-25 11:53:16 so just like a tank but with a missile army inside it?
help 2021-08-25 11:54:48 ur gonba motorlock the whole thing or just the missiles
help 2021-08-25 11:55:39 i see but it might be a little complicated if u haven't built any motorlocked yet
help 2021-08-25 11:56:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 11:56:44 can we use propeller blades for the aeronautical engineer rank?

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 12:22:03 man i can already imagine ppl saying my wright flyer is overbuilt once i post it in creation
