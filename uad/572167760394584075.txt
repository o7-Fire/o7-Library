general 2023-06-02 17:03:52 Lol ok
general 2023-06-02 17:04:29 idk, who am I?
general 2023-06-02 17:05:05 ok
general 2023-06-02 17:05:49 In psychiatric care :<
general 2023-06-02 17:06:07 Long term depression
general 2023-06-02 17:06:53 Jeez
general 2023-06-02 17:07:38 o-0
general 2023-06-02 17:09:29 Dumb question but what’s a good way to sell a retired Star Wars set
general 2023-06-02 17:10:10 Never even heard of FlightPoint
general 2023-06-02 17:10:25 Oh now I remember
general 2023-06-02 17:10:59 Yea I remember now because someone made a vid named “PC2 LEAKED!!1!1!11” and it was just FlightPoint
general 2023-06-02 18:04:18 Who here likes Star Wars?
general 2023-06-02 18:04:35 I’m 5’9
general 2023-06-02 18:05:07 I’m exceptionally tall for a Filipino 17 year old
general 2023-06-02 18:05:19 150-ish
general 2023-06-02 18:05:58 I almost never get the required amount of calories
general 2023-06-02 18:06:04 W
general 2023-06-02 18:06:26 It’s nearly impossible for me to be fat for some reason
general 2023-06-04 03:03:28 The scrunkly
general 2023-06-04 03:04:45 However nothing is cuter than perfectly normal people
general 2023-06-04 03:05:18 We get it ur a furry but that doesn’t mean you have to say uwu every 6 seconds
general 2023-06-04 03:06:20 Idk where I would be
general 2023-06-04 03:06:27 Def not a supporter of America tho
general 2023-06-04 03:06:36 What-
general 2023-06-04 03:06:50 You replying means you care tho
general 2023-06-04 03:07:10 If you really didn’t care you wouldn’t have even pointed it out
general 2023-06-04 03:07:26 Isn’t PC2 cancelled tho
general 2023-06-04 03:08:31 <:bruhhh:1086098909622964315>
general 2023-06-04 03:09:02 Not rlly
general 2023-06-04 03:10:19 Yea, so?
I’m born male. I am male. That’s there because people think otherwise for some dumb reason.
general 2023-06-04 03:11:23 Only known reason it happened before was because I said rcta wasn’t valid
general 2023-06-04 03:11:49 So they said I lost my male priveleges
general 2023-06-04 03:12:20 Because I hate being pushed around
general 2023-06-04 03:13:23 Rcta is like saying ur another ethnicity even tho ur something else
general 2023-06-04 03:15:08 It only took 2 seconds for me to get brain cancer from seeing the channel
general 2023-06-04 03:15:37 Is it low flying or you just don’t breathe
general 2023-06-04 03:15:49 Pretty much
general 2023-06-04 03:16:27 Jeez
general 2023-06-04 03:17:30 I mean, it was the 1920’s, they once thought firemen today would have jetpacks
general 2023-06-04 03:17:53 I agree but their depiction was whack as hell
general 2023-06-04 03:18:20 Literally looked like dragon wings on a backpack
general 2023-06-04 03:18:46 Oh, FlightPoint?
Is it harder or easier to build in than Plane Crazy?
general 2023-06-04 03:19:33 Probably more advanced physics
general 2023-06-04 03:20:29 So it’s easier to make things with more intricate detail?
general 2023-06-04 03:21:25 Bro who are you to determine that
general 2023-06-04 03:21:33 Yea I can see why
general 2023-06-04 03:21:45 More importantly how do engines work in that game
general 2023-06-04 03:39:55 Yea ur right
Whole ‘nother game
general 2023-06-04 03:40:32 Oh, absolutely
general 2023-06-04 03:41:18 While I like the fact that you can make more intricate builds, it’s pretty hard to “re-learn Plane Crazy”
general 2023-06-04 03:42:08 It is, if only I had a more powerful PC <:bruhhh:1086098909622964315>
general 2023-06-04 03:43:13 Most of my knowledge on how to build stuff in Plane Crazy was watching a lot of tutorials, which was why I was able to end up making better and better builds. FlightPoint may be harder to learn that way
general 2023-06-04 03:43:46 𝕻𝖆𝖎𝖓 𝖚𝖓𝖉 𝕾𝖚𝖋𝖋𝖊𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖌
general 2023-06-04 03:44:12 First thing I did was “screw the Tutorial, let’s spawn this guy’s F-5 Tiger”
general 2023-06-04 03:44:57 Downside tho, I have no clue how to learn from reverse engineering
general 2023-06-04 03:45:57 If that can lag the game I could only imagine a more intricate and detailed version of my Oil Rig with self destructing capabilities <:skullsob:1086104108441817178>
general 2023-06-04 03:47:30 Due to reduced size of the parts?
general 2023-06-04 03:47:48 Like, this thing is massive, almost took up my entire plot in Plane Crazy
general 2023-06-04 03:48:20 Even had oil leak and electrical issue features
general 2023-06-04 03:48:43 Right, I guess
general 2023-06-04 03:49:08 Yea what makes the game lag when my oil rig explodes is how many blocks it affects
general 2023-06-04 03:49:20 I guess it won’t be that much if it’s all stretched out
general 2023-06-04 03:51:41 Why would you
general 2023-06-04 03:52:24 How W is a girl when she plays War Thunder and hits the gym a lot
general 2023-06-04 03:53:36 I’d love to watch the rest of this cat fight of an argument but I’m tired so yea
general 2023-06-05 03:21:39 ??
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:22:47 Dump and Burn feature
If only this plane wasn’t super unstable
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:23:51 Most of the players I come across on PC and FP are like 15+
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:24:57 Imo
Kid = 6-12
Teen=13-17
Adult=18+
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:25:10 Well that’s not rlly an opinion that’s normal facts
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:27:47 If only it was shorter
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:28:18 Well I kinda hate how I made my F-111 but this was also my first wide cockpit plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:28:46 I wish I could but motorlock towers are kinda hard for me
Because I have to know where to place everything
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:29:44 The biggest motorlock tower I ever made was for a tiny ass car
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:30:50 I’m very aware that I’m fucking ass at building but I was thinking more combat capability when I was building this tbh
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:37:15 I tend to just avoid motorlock entirely unless I’m trying to stuff something inside my jet
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:38:00 Probably my most capable jet as of right now
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:38:40 This is literally the one jet that uses the most motorlock out of everything
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:38:58 Engine compaction
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:39:35 It’s hybridized between hover drive and super rocket
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:41:02 They aren’t pageant queens, their purpose is to kill things
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:42:49 When I built this I only cared if it can rack a good kill-to-loss ratio
It was never made to look pretty
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:46:12 Again, I never looked twice for looks because I only cared about combat capabilities which is why everything I build looks like it’s from 2018
Not only that I try my best to avoid tutorials because that’s kinda cheating
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:48:11 Well also at the same time I’d rather figure out things on my own because it’s more fulfilling than borderline copy and paste
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:48:56 I never said mine was better
I only said my main focus for these was to make them for combat
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:50:50 You can’t please everyone, they say
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:56:33 Prob my worst jet in looks but also this jet had the highest kill rate out of all my aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:56:57 That’s what I’ve been saying
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:57:18 Probably because of how simple it is irl
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:57:52 This was also made sometime after the Chengdu shit brick you were talking about
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 03:58:34 I’m genuinely surprised with how sharply I can turn with my MiG-21
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:01:52 The most laggy thing I built was an Oil Rig
I genuinely forgot why I built it
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:02:30 However people loved it because of how rare they were + there were places they could explore themselves
Or attack
plane-crazy 2023-06-05 04:02:38 Genuinely amazing
