plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:38:51 those trapdoor wings are only good because you can land without them
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:39:00 theyre so weightless they dont even need to be there
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:39:24 otherwise the trapdoor nose sucks
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:39:58 no real reason for it
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:40:08 the plane looks 10x more ass with the trapdoor nose and shit
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:40:52 this shit just ugly as hell
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:41:54 plus, you wouldnt need all that stabilization wing panel utter bullshit if you just used wing panels, guess where, in the fucking wings
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 02:44:38 plus the motorlock in the wing is just ugly as fuck too
you can do both wings with the locking motor inside the aircraft, so theres no excuse other than being a lazy fuck
plane-crazy 2023-05-08 22:34:48 namnam jet users when i bash their skull in with a rusty lawnmower and chisel

creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:31:20 missing the bottom front probe bit btw, and that spike behind cockpit, and the ramp up to the cockpit? where are they?

just play neo x at this point the jets are made for you
creations-chat 2023-05-30 02:34:32 f14 overrated as shit but its not a shit f14 atleast

creations-chat 2023-05-31 14:48:21 
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:55:40 what the fuck why did it get deleted fucking hell

ill dm you a colour palette

i think my discord glitching idfk man
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:57:48 that shit look kinda cool though
wouldnt put it in creations
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:59:55 try colouring the intakes and seeing, they may look bad because theyre uncoloured, could always put a pyramid wedge in there and then turn a pyramid 45¬∞ in a motorlock to give it a sort of jet engine thingy
creations-chat 2023-05-31 23:03:41 that center is looking horrific by the way theres alot of dents and gaps

that entire plane is kinda messy tbh
creations-chat 2023-05-31 23:05:56 its like some tnt bullshit that'd be absolute agony no
plane-crazy 2023-05-31 23:35:25 thats fucking horrendous

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:22:09 idfc make it work
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:23:15 use slabs
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:27:41 camo greens
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:27:48 just use a colour picker
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:32:00 tutorial
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:10 clearly not
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:31 f16
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:42 thats effort
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:33:51 this isnt effort
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:34:05 just use like rgb values and that shit
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:34:13 rgb values op
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:34:34 its like two minutes of colourpicking a dcs model
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:36:20 just look up (jet) (camo) and find one of these
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:36:50 shits easier tbh
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:37:54 are you trying to replicate the top one
if so why is the bottom one so blue
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:38:17 probably
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:40:14 do this camo or something because its not so one coloured
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:45:47 do some shitty motorlock piston bullshit, add a blue text, and put a small fullstop on it, and then a little below it, put a white fullstop but have that one bigger
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:45:56 or just dont add it
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 01:46:57 need to be able to put decals in plane crazy

creations-chat 2023-06-01 01:59:35 why are you so angry about a steak btw
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:09:11 right one, but that text is a bit too red
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:09:18 and a bit low
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:09:27 on the nose
creations-chat 2023-06-01 02:09:56 i just wanted to know

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:22:03 i have a excuse for shitty building
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:23:05 this isnt  alaptop
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:32:06 tbh this shit is criminally bad  but my only excuse was i was on a pc that ran the game at 4 fps
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:34:36 took on phone
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:34:38 cropped

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 02:58:45 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:38:00 neo x is better now
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:39:36 where are they
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:40:51 just play neo warfare x you cant make a shitty plane yk
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:43:00 
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:44:31 pc2 will be irrelevant by release data
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 00:32:11 advice on making a f22 intake?
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 00:32:56 im fucking shit at this game
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:05:25 why would you make it like  biblically accurate,  why did you need to make a gearbox
are you going to make a a 100x scaled up car or something
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:07:35 is this necessary? or is it a modern art piece

tbf, why would you genuinely do this
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:12:22 ok
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:15:31 wow
creations-chat 2023-06-02 01:18:14 really
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:11:48 plane crazy dying tbf

pc2 is taking way too long to come out, theres no updates in pc apart from the summer events, and lets be honest, what changes do they really make
you need either a new map, new blocks, or even better, a way to add decals, a new mechanical block, or a new weapon

any of those would make pc somewhat returnable and or a replayable sort of game

you make up a few jets, and get bored of the 2 hour motorlocking build, for your jet just to be shit by standard

imo the nam su 27 is the biggest factor in why pc is shit now
dogfights are boring spam this or turn tighter, tanks are fucking boring, boats just get SA'd, and nobody does trains

the only thing developing or updating, is how to be more of a prick in pvp

pve is boring you can shove your 10000+ block nuclear reactor or scp site or mech or 747 right up your backside
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:25:13 pc got post nut clarity

neo warfare x is better anyways, the games 10x more enjoyable, you dont need to be in hours making stuff to be good, and the game is kinda balanced
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:28:20 imo, swap from pc to neo warfare x, only making is making decals which is easy enough, games kinda balanced, just better
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:30:30 tbf yeah

wouldnt end up like this guy if he played neo tho
