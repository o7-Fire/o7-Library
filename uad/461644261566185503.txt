the-dump 2020-08-08 17:08:21 But I kinda like it
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:25:52 Hmm... welp so the build hight is shorter then the build space. So the build space is not a cube
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:26:34 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:26:55 So now I can’t build my 1meter 1 block l 30 zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:27:53 As I would have four folds but it’s 198 blocks long and 23 block diameter
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:28:05 But it won’t fit
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 17:30:41 I am now mad that I can’t build a 1block 1meter l 30 zeppelin because the build space is not a perfect cube space
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:40:20 Would rickje update the build space to have a higher build hight?
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:40:31 Or like make the build hight a cube
creations-chat 2020-08-08 17:48:42 As build space is width 47 by 47 by 47 by47 and hight is 39
bug-reports 2020-08-08 19:27:49 I notice that the build space is a cube width 47 blocks and max build hight is 39 blocks. So the build area is now a perfect cube
bug-reports 2020-08-08 19:48:10 Wishing that rickje could maby make an acceptable update on the plot size by making the max hight 51 blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-08 20:02:31 I am running out of ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-08 20:10:56 I been wanting to build a zeppelin but the build space is a bit small
bug-reports 2020-08-08 20:44:13 Why
bug-reports 2020-08-08 20:45:24 All it would be in increasing build hight to 51
bug-reports 2020-08-08 20:45:40 But then I not much of a scripter and more of a builder
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:16:07 Updated ID4 attacker. Better paint job and made it have different shades. A lot more stability when flying, able to dodge objects very fast and takes a while to take down.
creations-chat 2020-08-08 23:19:05 Like the nose shape

creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:48:14 Ok so I finished with my crappy amazon prime air drone
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:49:23 It only can hover but spins some reason so I gave up on it
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:51:40 So as I can’t fit a zeppelin l 30 I can fit a l 10
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:51:50 L 30 gray
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:51:59 
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:52:08 L 10 pee color
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:52:12 
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:54:08 Now it will be in 1block 1meter as saying 1:1 scale will piss someone off and be a know it all
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:54:22 The l 30 has a 23 block diameter
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:54:39 And the build hight is a bit short
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:54:56 But the l 10 has a 18 diameter
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:55:05 And a bit shorter
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:55:20 And looks less cooler
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:55:43 I wish rickje fix the build hight to be the same as the width
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:56:08 The more I look at it I like both
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:56:15 But I still like big things

creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:58:24 Also what material
creations-chat 2020-08-10 03:59:46 At least the ground gondola is the same so if rickje does fix the build hight I could build l 30
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:00:32 Ok
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:01:36 Build space is it is 51 blocks width and 39 blocks tall

bug-reports 2020-08-10 04:05:04 But any way rickje are you going to keep the build hight at 39? As the build width is 59. Should the build hight be 59
creations-chat 2020-08-10 04:08:05 I am thinking on waiting of building a zeppelin just in case rickje decide to increase build hight

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 07:33:38 
creations-chat 2020-08-19 07:37:11 Anyone got an ideal how I could make this in plane crazy on my b 36
creations-chat 2020-08-19 17:06:00 How the stay puff marshmallow man costume build for milky man going
creations-chat 2020-08-20 02:45:11 She’s flys!! The god damn thing acutely flys!! Still no helium and with4103 blocks. Needs a long run way longer then the airport also is a ass to line it up with a run way.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 02:47:26 But a big target for shredder bugs but they get stuck in the wings
creations-chat 2020-08-20 02:50:43 Time to recreate this. The b 36 is docking the small fight jet into its bomb bay and is used to protect the b 36. Also the pilot can get out into the b 36
creations-chat 2020-08-20 02:54:23 
creations-chat 2020-08-20 04:52:26 Just started to smooth out the wings and completely smoothed our the jet engines as they were the smallest and in a tight spot also add some more details like the nose turrets and tail
creations-chat 2020-08-20 04:52:54 Also bomb bay is added but I don’t like how it looks as it too big of an open but it works
creations-chat 2020-08-20 04:53:44 Also some jack ass though it was a good ideal to ram into my plane with his lawnmower mix truck car and drive my plane into the train rails
creations-chat 2020-08-20 06:22:58 Anyone know why when I wanted to point my b 36 plane nose up to get lift and to go higher then when I stop it starts to point down? Help
creations-chat 2020-08-20 06:23:16 
creations-chat 2020-08-20 06:25:37 And it not because it’s nose heavy because the tail is heavy and I put balest block in the nose for even weight
creations-chat 2020-08-20 06:34:57 But that’s the only problem with flying. Well it is slow when turning but I will fix that. Also needs a long run way to fly
help 2020-08-20 07:28:52 Anyone know why when I wanted to point my b 36 plane nose up to get lift and to go higher then when I stop it starts to point down? Help
help 2020-08-20 21:05:23 Anyone know why when I wanted to point my b 36 plane nose up to get lift and to go higher then when I stop it starts to point down? Help. It uses control surfaces
help 2020-08-20 21:06:06 But that’s the only problem it has it slow when turning but I can fix that
help 2020-08-20 21:06:51 It’s not nose heavy it’s more tail heavy so I used ballest blocks to even out the weight
help 2020-08-20 21:08:01 But I fly mobile
help 2020-08-20 21:19:34 
help 2020-08-20 21:19:34 The problem is when I stop pressings “w” to gain lift the plane starts to go down
creations-chat 2020-08-20 21:22:54 There need to be a option to still show the center of mass and center of lift when you spawn in your build. It would help people with folded builds like my b 36
creations-chat 2020-08-20 21:26:23 
creations-chat 2020-08-20 21:29:16 If my plane starts to point down after I get lift then just stop doing anything does that mean it’s center of lift or thrust is off?
help 2020-08-20 21:57:05 Thanks

creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:05:39 Anyone know why my b 36 keeps going down after I stop trying to gain lift with control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:05:54 It’s tail heavy
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:06:01 More then nose heavy
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:06:14 What
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:06:30 I don’t know there under the wings
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:06:35 
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:06:59 
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:07:19 But then it won’t look accurate
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:08:06 I started to see if I put engine facing the front in the nose to try to keep it straight but then it starts to go down faster so it a thrust problem
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:08:52 It had helium but did not help
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:09:56 I have ballest blocks in the nose to stop the tail being heavy
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:10:10 But not to were it to heavy
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:10:48 So rebuild the wings
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:10:50 ...
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:11:24 Ahh balls
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:11:59 I could move the wing mount part forward and use motor lock to make it line up
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:13:04 It’s built in 1:5/1 scale
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:13:16 And the wings a 2 blocks short
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:13:25 As I don’t have enough room
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:13:46 Like as engines?
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:14:01 I have
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:15:08 Thinking of move the wings foward by motor lock
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:15:37 And rebuilding the wing mount as that’s simple
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:16:38 Yea I been sleeping less and less so my building has been more sloppy and slow also I notice a huge error in my math in the wing mount
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:16:55 So yeah fix the wings placement
creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:18:11 Well poop how would I use motor lock to move wings

creations-chat 2020-08-21 01:20:16 Any ideals
