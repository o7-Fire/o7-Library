help 2022-02-26 23:02:25 i've built planes with this type of control surface configuration or whatever before, but for some reason this time, it's rotating extremely slow, does anyone know why this is happening
help 2022-02-27 04:44:29 how come when I motorlock a bunch of hover thrusters into an aircraft it moves slower than it with just a few hover thrusters, are the thrusters flinging off somewhere? or is something else happening
help 2022-02-27 16:03:32 why does this move slower
help 2022-02-27 16:03:34 than this
help 2022-02-27 16:08:01 what
help 2022-02-27 16:15:06 so it would be better to move them thrusters over a bit so they don't stack on top of each other?
