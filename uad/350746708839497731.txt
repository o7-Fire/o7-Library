general 2020-01-16 06:02:43 I've tried, but it makes a strange gap between these two parts, and i want to know if someone actually knows a better way

general 2020-01-18 03:49:27 It is simple
general 2020-01-18 03:49:33 It is simple, just not easy
general 2020-01-18 03:49:47 From what your're talking about
general 2020-01-18 03:50:19 Well the hardest part is, for it to turn, the back rotor must get slower and faster, so yea, there is the first problem
general 2020-01-18 03:50:45 The hell is that
general 2020-01-18 03:51:15 Be a little more specific bruh
general 2020-01-18 03:51:39 I was looking at the google
general 2020-01-18 03:52:00 So, its the part that makes the blades move, without moving the helicopter along?
general 2020-01-18 03:52:15 Ah, thanks
general 2020-01-18 03:52:28 So yea, that, actually sounds hard to build, thanks
general 2020-01-18 03:53:13 What a mess of motors
general 2020-01-18 03:53:43 Man, i remember a game called sandbox metal works, at least half of those tools could be useful here

general 2020-01-18 04:16:04 There is some sort of racism going on

general 2020-01-18 04:24:30 Well, at least they're not very efficient in pvp
general 2020-01-18 04:24:42 Actually, is there any way that a ship is efficient at pvp?
general 2020-01-18 04:26:15 Like, submarines have protection from water and can hide, cars can run and hide on buildings and terrain, planes are just fast and can dodge
general 2020-01-18 04:26:19 But, what about boats?
