plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:03:00 So I‚Äôm new to the community and it seems like the everyone here hates tutorials what‚Äôs the deal?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:05:24 I get that but I maybe have 10 hours and I‚Äôve seen at least 3 players get called out and harassed for coping something they saw, thought was cool and were given permission to copy?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:05:51 It just isn‚Äôt something you see in other games
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:08:54 Here take Minecraft for a example am I some how less of a person for watching a tutorial on how to do a complicated red stone build or a house
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:09:36 And who decided it was okay to deem someone that way over what they do in a video game
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:11:05 Some people find different thing complex
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:14:05 Okay that‚Äôs great but what if I came up to you when you were new and I said ‚Äúhey I don‚Äôt like that your doing that stop it now and build your own thing‚Äù you probably would have taken a lot longer to learn how to do things
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:15:01 And take the in game tutorial plane if I hadn‚Äôt done that I probably would have quit immediately out of sheer fustration
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:15:19 I know they are not the same thing but it shows the importance of tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:16:02 Okay that makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:16:40 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:17:21 But I also believe in the power of monkey see monkey do
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:17:41 You see something awesome you build it and you improve
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:19:53 I want to provide my own example
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:21:09 My first jet was a heap of mistake I googled the word airplane saw a a-10 warthog, saw a fan like shape on the air intake and decide oh it is a propellor plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:21:35 I closed the tab and went to work making a plane incorrectly
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:22:06 If I had just did a little research or watched a tutorial I would have seen that it most certainly isn‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:22:31 On the other hand tho without the tutorial I was able to create my first plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:22:36 Though
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:23:01 I created something original weird well be it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:23:51 Yes and that is why I accept that you should make every one of your builds a tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:24:49 Create something original but I also agree that no one should be criticized for seeking inspiration or copying something they make very well use to improve their skills
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:25:09 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:25:27 You have to learn from it to expand it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:25:54 You have to go wow that is a cool technique I will use that next time
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:23 PCC?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:31 Sorry I‚Äôm new
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:26:36 Thank you
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:28:43 Here what I believe
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:28:49 You should learn by example
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:29:19 Your given a piece of paper in school an told to learn trigonometry by yourself
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:29:51 You taught by the teacher how to do it and so that you know how to do it next time
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:30:19 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:31:23 That‚Äôs a very good example
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:32:27 But if you had studied the examples you had and used them to learn there would be no need for it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:43:00 You don‚Äôt art is a myth like the the tooth fairy and vitamins
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:43:12 God I hate vitamins
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:43:44 It‚Äôs a joke do you mean the role?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:44:31 To do that you have to paint a build that is 200 blocks and a score of 30

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 01:00:15 What should I do to make my plane able to take off from water

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 01:01:02 Floats

creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:45:48 Because anyone who wants to post thing obviously come and ask for advice first and you must have great balance keeping your self on a pedestal for so long
