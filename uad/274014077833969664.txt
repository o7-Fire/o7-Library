plane-crazy 2019-10-15 14:56:33 milk, cereal, bowl is the only correct answer.

plane-crazy 2019-10-15 15:00:57 cutter blocks have a good shape i could use for my aircraft :0
plane-crazy 2019-10-15 23:10:24 I was about to take a really good picture of my aircraft... and my screenshotting tool literally cant go over roblox

plane-crazy 2019-10-22 01:53:10 Uh, I tried posting in the report section, said i sent the same message multiple times, (which i didn't) and this guy built a lag machine, anyone i can report it too directly
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 01:54:47 Alright. Thanks anyway.
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 01:57:25 I have the image in my head, the damn cow.
plane-crazy 2019-10-22 01:58:38 Wow, complete disregard for human emotions.

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 20:37:07 the v-22's tilt is hard to replicate. its hurting my brain.
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 03:31:33 I finally got my v-22 done, damn...
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:24:10 I have a quick question, I haven't played in like 2 months, my F-15C's motor 2's for the ailerons aren't working- are they broken again?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:25:36 Oh weird, for me when I go to activate my ailerons it seizures just like they did when they were first implemented
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:26:29 my f-15c is my only good aircraft as I don't use tutorials, and is sluggish w/o ailerons. and... Alxti, I said I haven't played in 2 months
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:26:40 I have literally just booted up the game for the first time in 2 months
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:26:47 what do you expect m8
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 01:27:21 I didn't care to read and didn't see any pings for it.
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 23:47:52 >saying who cares because you think it's only your opinion that matters
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:32:29 Will it be possible to transfer builds from pc1 to pc2 or will I have to rebuild? Not that it'll be a huge issue just wondering ðŸ‘Œ
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:34:07 My bad I was trying to look for that message ðŸ‘€
plane-crazy 2022-06-01 21:35:06 Very much is :)
