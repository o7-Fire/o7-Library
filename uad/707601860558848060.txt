The Tale of wew0071 (707601860558848060)
general 2021-03-01 14:47:13 is it possible to make a laser beam in the game
general 2021-03-01 14:48:27 im making a sby ship and i need a way to make a wave motion gun which is basically death star beam v2
general 2021-03-01 14:51:52 yes
general 2021-03-01 14:51:54 its not done
general 2021-03-01 14:51:59 its kind of big
general 2021-03-01 14:52:25 how would you like me to show you
general 2021-03-01 15:02:50 will the dev add a plot expansion update btw
general 2021-03-01 15:02:52 i need it
general 2021-03-01 15:03:22 whyyyyyyy it restricts the size of my builds
general 2021-03-01 15:03:31 i do
general 2021-03-01 15:03:34 still out of space
general 2021-03-01 15:03:59 uh
general 2021-03-01 15:04:00 very
general 2021-03-01 15:06:06 the ship is currently split in 2 and because of the bridge i cant make another last fold for the stern but there is space above the first area (the bow) but i cant really figure out how to fold it from there
general 2021-03-01 15:09:02 where do i paste it
general 2021-03-01 15:10:38 ive figured out how to angle it now but the motors just flop downwards by themselves and break the mechanism sometimes
general 2021-03-01 15:11:05 wat
general 2021-03-01 15:11:34 whereeeee
general 2021-03-01 15:12:00 i canttttt
general 2021-03-01 15:14:14 i can build above the bow but idk how to fold it
general 2021-03-01 15:14:18 yeah that
general 2021-03-01 15:16:33 i feel like the motor locking will be really complicated
general 2021-03-01 15:17:29 what if i shorten the bridge immensly , then it will barely just fit
general 2021-03-04 09:57:19 if you motor lock alot of smoke canisters together will it create a massive smoke plume
general 2021-03-04 12:42:53 is it just me or does the harrier and f4 look simular
general 2021-03-04 12:44:15 oh i get why i thought they were simular
general 2021-03-04 12:45:20 tail
general 2021-03-04 12:48:39 i know about the wings but the tail and fuselage look similar to me
general 2021-03-16 12:24:13 REEEEE
general 2021-11-11 23:19:39 How do you make a really long wedge
general 2021-11-11 23:19:46 Longer than 1x4
general 2021-11-11 23:20:04 What is angle lock
general 2021-11-11 23:25:58 Ty
general 2021-11-12 21:47:51 Ew
general 2021-11-13 11:53:10 How can I make a fast explosive cannon for my a10
general 2021-11-13 11:53:26 The hull inside is 3x3 so@i@can fit a smal mechanism in there
general 2021-11-13 12:23:30 How 2 make explosive Gatling gun for a10
general 2021-11-13 12:23:51 I have 3x3 space inside the hull because i made a giant a10
general 2021-11-17 20:29:49 Is there a way to make an automatic explosive machine gun for an A10 warthog or something
general 2021-11-17 20:30:29 Howwwww
general 2021-11-17 20:30:49 That’s not very helpful
general 2021-11-17 20:31:22 I have a large a10
general 2021-11-17 20:31:27 10 guns won’t cut it
general 2021-11-17 20:31:46 It’s like putting 2 browning light machine guns on an AC 130
general 2021-11-17 20:32:12 Does this actually work
general 2021-11-17 20:32:40 They are a bit hard to see
general 2021-11-17 20:32:59 Should I colour the circle things yellow so the bullets are more visable
general 2021-11-17 20:36:50 Why u no use custom control flaps
general 2021-11-17 20:37:02 They turn the plane 180 degrees in 0.1 seconds
general 2021-11-17 20:37:19 Why
general 2021-11-17 21:00:37 Is there a way to make reloading bombs
general 2021-11-17 21:01:08 I have that
general 2021-11-17 21:01:16 But it’s so f word ing laggy
general 2021-11-17 21:01:25 When I take off tutorial plane shoots rocket at me and I die instantly
general 2021-11-17 21:02:10 Also how do you fix the thing when ur giant plane moves slowly then fast repeatedly
general 2021-11-17 21:02:55 What
general 2021-11-17 21:03:36 Actually reloading bombs isn’t an issue
general 2021-11-17 21:04:00 I want to press b and drop 1 bomb at a time but there’s no function to do that
general 2021-11-17 21:04:09 Why
general 2021-11-17 21:04:36 Ok
general 2021-11-17 21:04:59 I think I’ll make a b36 peacemaker and use conveyors for the bombs
general 2021-11-17 21:05:48 So the bombs will cover a wide area instead of dropping all at once
general 2021-11-17 21:06:13 Why?
general 2021-11-17 21:06:39 I deleted my message while typing twice lol because it didn’t seem right
general 2021-11-17 21:24:08 Aa guns
general 2021-11-17 21:24:57 Does someone have a b36 peace maker
general 2021-11-17 21:25:10 The giant plane with backwards propellers and jet engines at the same time
general 2021-11-18 00:22:46 Why is my plane shakes
general 2021-11-18 00:22:54 When I turn it it shakes left and right
general 2021-11-18 00:22:55 A lot

general 2021-11-18 00:38:32 Nice
general 2021-11-18 00:38:46 Wait that’s not plane crazy
general 2021-11-18 00:39:12 How did you get the bombs like that what
general 2021-11-18 00:39:39 Thought so
general 2021-11-18 00:41:30 Hey guys
general 2021-11-18 00:41:52 Do you think I could make a rocket launcher machine gun if I made a really long gun and lined it with rocket launchers
general 2021-11-18 00:42:10 If I hold f will that pour a stream line of rockets down the barrel
general 2021-11-18 00:43:24 Btw is there a help channel
general 2021-11-18 00:43:47 I want to know why my motor 2 turret spazes out and shakes uncontrollably

general 2021-11-18 17:14:01 @ everyperson
general 2021-11-19 00:34:18 Can I fix the motor 2 trying correcting itself and causing shaking
general 2021-11-19 00:35:05 When you want to go to the left or something then the motor 2 with wings can do that but it automatically goes too far and goes the other way causing it to shake
general 2021-11-19 16:10:41 https://youtu.be/6-HUgzYPm9g
general 2021-11-20 00:23:58 Has anyone use custom control panels
general 2021-11-20 00:24:07 Or just wings on inverted motor 2
general 2021-11-20 00:24:19 Well why does it shake so much
general 2021-11-20 00:24:34 When I turn fast
general 2021-11-20 00:24:44 My plane goes too far then goes back up and down repeat
general 2021-11-20 00:25:03 It just shakes the direction I was turning and back repeatedly and takes a long time to stop
general 2021-11-20 00:25:07 Can’t aim because it’s shaking
general 2021-11-21 00:40:05 Shut
general 2021-11-21 00:40:07 Nooooob

general 2021-11-21 02:52:37 You have to fly really high
general 2021-11-21 02:53:32 Make a Saturn v with landing module and command module
general 2021-11-21 02:53:39 Make it have 0 gravity
general 2021-11-21 02:53:51 And dock at a high altitude

general 2021-11-21 02:56:44 Is it bad
general 2021-11-21 02:56:52 It’s funny seeing people being proud of terrible builds and flexing about them
general 2021-11-21 02:57:32 Plane crazy 2????
general 2021-11-21 02:57:45 
general 2021-11-21 02:58:00 Why isn’t the fire work launcher automatic
general 2021-11-21 02:58:03 I just want to@hold click

general 2021-11-21 02:59:24 EWWWW
general 2021-11-21 02:59:44 How can he be surprised
general 2021-11-21 02:59:47 He’s literally using
general 2021-11-21 02:59:51 Control panel spam
general 2021-11-21 02:59:57 And grated wings
general 2021-11-21 03:00:13 He’s also using minimum width wings for a heavy bomber
general 2021-11-21 03:00:34 So it looks like a rectangle on extremely long genshin impact gliders
general 2021-11-21 03:00:37 But grated like I said
general 2021-11-21 03:00:44 The turrets aren’t even detailed
general 2021-11-21 03:00:49 The fuselage has no design
general 2021-11-21 03:00:58 How can he be so salty
general 2021-11-21 03:01:04 Fair
general 2021-11-21 03:02:02 I know

general 2021-11-21 03:03:18 
general 2021-11-21 03:04:04 He was to cocky
general 2021-11-21 03:04:12 Didn’t realise it
general 2021-11-21 03:04:22 Believing his build was good and we were just being ass holes
general 2021-11-21 03:04:38 When we were judging it based on most the builds which are based
general 2021-11-21 03:04:57 He just thought his build was good and we were being ass holes
general 2021-11-21 03:05:14 If he saw other peoples builds he would have see why he wasn’t praised
general 2021-11-21 03:05:40 Why would you use control panel spam for wings and expect praise for such a noob  way of steering
general 2021-11-21 03:07:02 Lolll
general 2021-11-21 03:07:05 Where is that from
general 2021-11-21 03:08:03 He was so salty my god
general 2021-11-21 03:08:14 Look at this fuselage design
general 2021-11-21 03:08:21 Look at the dam wing thickness
general 2021-11-21 03:08:24 How do u expect praise
general 2021-11-21 21:19:50 I dare someone
general 2021-11-21 21:20:06 To make a helicopter with a motor 2 rotor
general 2021-11-21 21:20:32 So they have to manually turn the rotor
general 2021-11-21 21:21:30 I mean default motor 2
general 2021-11-21 21:21:33 Not servo
general 2021-11-21 21:21:47 Spin the rotor manually
help 2021-11-24 16:54:16 How can u counter translating tendency on a helicopter without using engines or separate hidden rotors which make it look wider
help 2021-11-24 17:05:41 Are the wings supposed to be thin
help 2021-11-24 17:06:07 Also why not use motor and rotor blade instead of skinny propeller engine
help 2021-11-24 21:13:26 Ok

general 2021-12-12 00:09:22 Why is my plane moving slower than the speed bar sometimes
general 2021-12-12 00:09:44 Whenever I build Chinese planes it displays like 600 speed but in reality I’m flying roughly 100
general 2021-12-12 00:10:16 I left but it wasn’t that bad
general 2021-12-12 00:10:24 It was atleast 30
general 2021-12-12 00:10:44 Well I’m trying to play on mobile right now
general 2021-12-12 00:11:11 But on pc it’s a very smooth game play yet my chinese aircraft always travel a lot slower than what it says on the bar

general 2021-12-12 00:12:32 Desk top
general 2021-12-12 00:12:58 My monitor is locked at 60fps but it never budges even when there is a huge lag machine
general 2021-12-12 00:13:36 My pc hardly lags but my j10 feels like it’s flying a bit slower than what it displays

general 2022-03-06 16:37:05 its 5300 blocks but when i spawn it, my fps is fine but gradually gets worse and worse until it stops at 0.5
general 2022-03-06 16:37:14 does anybody else have this problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:38:30 when i spawn my 5300 block sub my fps is fine but gradually gets worse and worse over time to the point i get 1fps even if i dont touch anything does anyone know what is going on
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:40:29 ty
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:40:38 yeah but other enormous builds dont lag my pc
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:40:55 when people use lag machines my fps stays the same
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:41:02 its only when i use this particular sub

plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:41:25 16gb of ram
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:41:59 not exactly 5300 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:42:08 ive had larger than 5300 but they didnt lag my fps
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 16:42:51 i deleted them though, it was 2 giant gunships that never took off yet had a ludicrous amount of super rockets and a giant carrier which was too big for my plot so i ran out of space and gave up
