The Tale of suspicious swimming dog (636208463751544834)
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 12:28:59 uh does anyone know whether its possible to make a carrier catapult system on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 12:29:19 got a method for that?
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 12:29:40 they're really hard to use, ngl
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 12:29:53 especially when you're trying to catapult **not your planes**
plane-crazy 2019-11-10 12:30:18 aight thanks kpc
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:46:14 Just me or do cameras not have a good center of mass?
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:47:39 let me introduce penor-sat-7
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:47:42 which is somehow unstable
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:47:55 i'm guessing it's the cameras
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:48:11 wat
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:54:50 How do people stabilize rockets?
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 14:54:58 I'm seriously confused
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:02:40 
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:02:43 Could someone tell me what this is?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:04:02 ok boomer
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:04:31 ok boomer 2x
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:05:18 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:11:21 thank you *developer*
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:12:19 oh uh
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:12:20 
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:19:16 It's some useless PB lab
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:21:44 And that
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:21:51 's interesting and useful how?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:24:20 Is there an actual roadmap for the game?
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 09:24:29 I feel like it's sort of slowly dying
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 12:50:49 Is the uh 'snow blaster' or whatever going to be accessible during this year's christmas/winter period?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 12:51:23 My question is also
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 12:51:28 does it produce thrust?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 12:51:40 Saw some guy use them as OMS in his rocket
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 15:41:08 Can magnets interact with things that don't necessarily belong to you?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 15:42:49 for some random reason literally every rocket i build has some messed up center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 15:42:52 
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 15:42:56 and i don't know why
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:09:11 Does anyone else sometimes have issues with disconnectors not working based on placement?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:10:47 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:11:32 
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:11:33 Anything wrong here?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:11:41 The disconnector just refuses to work.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:12:29 The thruster is apart of what the disconnector disconnects, though.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:12:56 Or is it because the disconnector cannot have anything welded to it on the sides?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:14:10 Removing the thruster doesn't fix the issue, let me try doing some fiddling around.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:16:00 https://gyazo.com/abd7dbdbf6b802c56e857984937e68d9
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:16:03 Bleh, even this doesn't work
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:18 I literally just removed some blocks then added them back and now boom magic everything works like it should
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:21 I hate this god damn game
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:44 ?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:46 Check what
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:56 https://www.roblox.com/users/1467480/profile
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:21:58 Eh?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:22:13 What kind of logic is that?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:22:34 Why would you randomly assume that I'm below 13?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:22:49 Bruh I've legit got a credit card
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:23:06 Correction, debit.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:23:29 Where do you even live?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:23:37 Bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:23:45 16 for driving here.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:24:07 Just turned 16 myself.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:25:08 IG Torpedos?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:25:09 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:25:22 Better anti air weapons when
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:26:07 Regular guns are so useless that I have to resort to integrating 6 guided missiles into my carrier just to make it survive jets
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:26:43 Lazy to do it right now, not that it's anything good.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:26:53 Sort of resembles the Q.E.
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:27:49 If the conveyors will be configurable to allow huge speeds then my carrier catapult system will truly be complete
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:28:17 Is there a test server available?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:28:19 Or is it private?
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 16:29:39 :(

plane-crazy 2019-11-21 17:24:42 the center of mass appears to be fine
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 17:24:46 but my rocket still goes apeshit
plane-crazy 2019-11-21 20:00:44 Anyone got a mouse-guided missile design that I could yoink?
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 10:07:49 
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 10:07:51 what the fuck logitech?
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 11:16:51 haha stupid snowman

plane-crazy 2019-11-22 14:36:21 <@!263959626804887552> planet update when
plane-crazy 2019-11-22 14:36:31 space gamer oppression >:(
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 19:53:37 Wish a building space increase would happen along with the terrain expansion update
plane-crazy 2019-11-23 19:53:40 :(
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:50:27 You know there's more than just CPU bound tasks that affect FPS, right?
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:50:41 Yeah, often
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:51:07 It's also entirely possible that even a high end CPU can be overloaded by Roblox's physics tasks
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:51:47 The engine isn't something you'd call very optimized, Roblox also tends to force clients to calculate physics of objects that they're next to, which is a weird effect.
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:52:14 You can uh see this when you stumble into a place that caused the physics engine on the server to freeze entirely
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:52:22 But the blocks you touch fall down or scatter like normal
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:53:08 I have a uh i7-7700HQ and it's probably not the best processor anymore
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:53:19 Especially since it thermal throttles to hell
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:54:00 I wonder how many people even overclock the K series processors they buy
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:54:48 I remember seeing this guy who has a 10+ core i9 processor with a really dank SLI build who literally just plays minecraft
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:54:55 Like
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:54:58 **bruh**
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:55:50 Like literally no one needs an i9 for games anyways
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:56:03 You might only need one for the purpose of rendering, editing or 3D modelling
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:56:12 Even then most of those tasks can often take advantage of CUDA
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:56:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:56:54 ok submarine commander
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:57:14 this is the only sub that i want to command

plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:59:48 The uh client physics nonsense I was talking about
plane-crazy 2019-11-24 13:59:52 found an example in <#495286269459300364>

creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:28:38 Small fighter plane, capable of going upwards of 611 SPS and remains stable, lots of pewpews, a ship and ground target killer
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:28:57 Yeah that jet engine is actually quite important to balance out of the center of flight
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:33:25 I will, it's just a prototype right now
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:36:51 A **very** functional carrier that I made a few weeks ago, intended for PVP, has four guided missiles hidden away in silos, a really ugly mouse-controlled CIWS, functional catapult system, compartments on the inside like a meeting room and secondary bridge.
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:39:55 That's not an issue that anyone can really fix
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:03 The carrier is literally as big as it can get
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:21 Why not?
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:40:50 Yeah but it's not some recreational WW2 carrier that serves no purpose apart from being eye candy
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:41:01 It wasn't really meant to be exceptionally good looking
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:41:16 Uhuh
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:42:07 Did I ever say I did?
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:42:17 It's a god damn floating kill box
creations-chat 2019-11-24 18:43:27 I'm just wondering why people tend to show their opinion more on my ugly carrier than my plane
