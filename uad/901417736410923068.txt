plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:50:49 It‚Äôs such a used artificialy created block
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:51:16 Maybe.
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:51:20 Or
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:51:22 Hopefully
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:51:48 Or a half wedgeblock
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:52:08 Actually it could be cos of scaleable blocks
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:52:22 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 20:52:39 I guess it‚Äôs a lot of work

creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:01:36 Instead of folding you could lock them into place with them having the same position they would have if folded but only above then have a parallel horizontal tower going to the edge of the wing and have a vertical tower attaching to the main aero foil of the wing
(It‚Äôs actually pretty simple)

You can do this so it will be:
more rigid
No gaps where the fold would be 
Easier to build 
Also overall more aesthetically pleasing.

creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:05:47 Could I get a close up so I could more effectively assess the build
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:10:29 If you want to be really nit picky you could use piston lock to make the wings thicker by layering wing panels
