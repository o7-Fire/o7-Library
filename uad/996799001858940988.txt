general 2023-04-02 01:34:16 maayybe
general 2023-04-02 01:34:38 it would still be fucking useless
general 2023-04-02 01:34:42 third person
general 2023-04-02 01:34:43 and you can zoom
general 2023-04-02 01:35:58 the ability to zoom
general 2023-04-02 01:36:15 Ok
general 2023-04-02 01:37:06 Shit
general 2023-04-02 01:37:14 why
general 2023-04-02 01:37:14 and
general 2023-04-02 01:37:18 could we
general 2023-04-02 01:37:20 do that
general 2023-04-02 01:38:57 "no real reasons all you did was swear"
here's a good reason without swear words

a radar would be completely useless due to the fact that we can zoom out of our aircraft, or zoom inside water in submarine situations, and we can look anywhere. putting cameras on missiles would be smarter instead of adding a radar because it would not indicate altitude
general 2023-04-02 01:38:58 happy?

general 2023-04-02 01:51:07 not only that
general 2023-04-02 01:51:12 pvp would be completely useless

general 2023-04-02 01:51:28 pc doesn't even have a realistic explosion range
general 2023-04-02 01:51:31 nor armor
general 2023-04-02 01:51:34 why even need missiles?
