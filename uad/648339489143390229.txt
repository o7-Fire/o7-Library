general 2020-04-23 05:12:57 ?!?!
general 2020-04-23 05:13:47 Oh.
general 2020-04-23 05:14:53 ...
help 2020-04-23 05:15:22 All I know is that Friction is different.
help 2020-04-23 05:16:10 Explosive Resistance isn't any different between materials last time I checked, but I 100% know friction is different.
help 2020-04-23 05:19:54 No problem.
the-dump 2020-04-24 19:56:24 Breaking News: Cleveland Browns declared permanent Super Bowl champions
the-dump 2020-04-24 19:57:21 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 19:57:41 It's called bait.
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 20:00:37 TitanicAiden2013 I recommend putting that in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 20:28:31 Probably not the largest built, but my largest is over 4500.
I bet someone here has a build over 6000 parts though.
general 2020-04-27 07:23:48 Just want to check in on the server. How are yall doing?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 07:46:46 It's cold there. I like the cold.
help 2020-04-28 08:53:16 I think it's just one.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 08:55:50 post that in reports and follow the format. (I think it's in the pinned message, but I haven't checked.)
bot-central 2020-04-29 01:04:43 The ranked role... How to get that?
help 2020-04-29 01:11:05 What if I get the requirements to get a rank, but I'm too shy to ping a moderator?
help 2020-04-29 01:14:37 Cause I generally am too shy to ping anyone.
help 2020-04-29 01:57:17 ok.
general 2020-05-04 06:30:17 I'm surprised that city still has ANY buildings.
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 08:47:48 There's 4 ways to fix this. (at least to my knowledge)
1: Add engines to the front.
2: Helium to the front side.
3: Ballast blocks to the back side.
4: Remove some engines in the back.
I'm not a VTOL pro though.
creations-chat 2020-05-10 05:20:18 Wait, the posts in <#384025409945337856> aren't Automatic?!
help 2020-05-12 04:49:38 I want to make a rank request. How do I create a link to a post of mine?
help 2020-05-12 04:52:06 Nevermind I figured it out
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 04:55:42 It's just my sleep schedule (and my sense of time as a whole) has pretty much collapsed on itself.
general 2020-05-26 23:41:50 Didn't the X-15 make it to space though?
general 2020-05-26 23:46:01 How did this go from USSR vs USA to Exploits?!
general 2020-05-27 06:19:41 Really? There's a tank that quick?
help 2020-06-20 05:37:34 Does every single motor (for the propellors) turn the same way? and yes I know I'm a little late.
help 2020-06-20 05:47:54 If one side is mirrored, then that'll probably help. If you need help for what I mean then I'll post an image to show what I mean.
help 2020-06-20 05:50:10 This surely is a puzzle...
help 2020-06-20 05:53:14 Can it drop bombs?
help 2020-06-20 05:53:36 Are the bombs connected via disconnectors?
help 2020-06-20 05:53:58 How many are on each side?
help 2020-06-20 05:55:42 ok. if it was randomly pitching up / down, then I'd have an idea. but when it's rolling to the left, I'm not sure...
help 2020-06-20 05:56:47 perhaps you messed up the folding?
help 2020-06-20 05:57:46 Maybe I'll have to inspect the plane myself.
help 2020-06-20 05:58:01 (I'll be moving this to private messages)
help 2020-06-20 06:22:13 The issue has been resolved. It was an issue with the propellor blades.
help 2020-06-20 06:25:36 It can really help when designing liveries.
help 2020-06-20 06:36:41 No problem. I'm glad I could help.
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 22:03:34 I think I've discovered something weird. It's not a glitch tho.
help 2020-06-25 10:20:26 Which section is the stair block in?
Edit: Nevermind I found them.
help 2020-06-25 10:21:34 Also I like design 2 the best
help 2020-07-05 01:49:29 Any good colors for a Wooden floor?
help 2020-07-05 02:09:57 Thank you!
Update: it looks nice!
help 2020-07-06 22:54:39 Do the miniature biomes have offical names or am I going to have to get to creative?
help 2020-07-06 22:56:36 The little areas in the map. The canyon, the rocky area, the sea, etc
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 06:09:30 Not sure how to feel about that.
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 06:09:53 Almost as bad as that pun

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 04:29:41 I'm honestly not sure how to feel about my latest project.
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 05:04:16 ...
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 05:04:24 I got no comment on that
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 05:11:49 holy hell...
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 05:15:55 Yeah I doubt that. That guy is having a Thermonuclear Meltdown.
the-dump 2020-08-04 06:56:28 Uh oh

Or, at least so far.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 10:24:34 They're a little confused but they got the spirit
general 2020-08-13 08:09:48 What's the deal with the latest <#490306593242611742> post?
I am genuinely confused...
general 2020-08-13 08:10:45 Oh
general 2020-08-13 08:11:27 I was, I just realized I mentioned the wrong channel
general 2020-08-13 08:11:46 Outlines are coming back?
general 2020-08-13 08:12:31 They're still visible
creations-chat 2020-08-14 07:14:30 I'm curious about the most upvoted thing as well
bug-reports 2020-08-15 09:30:45 I can't get that out of my head now thanks for that
general 2020-08-15 22:41:01 Ok, there's a lot of issues with the US. But this isn't the place to discuss it / them.

creations-chat 2020-08-21 07:41:29 A Chainsaw on wheels is something I'd imagine Dr. Bright would come up with.

general 2020-08-25 04:33:56 What have we DONE?!
general 2020-08-25 04:34:24 Is that the guy from Payday?
general 2020-08-25 04:36:12 Trying to locate...
general 2020-08-25 04:36:32 Unable to locate.
general 2020-08-25 04:37:25 what happened to that world
general 2020-08-25 04:37:52 We've got a multi-dimensional rescue operation happening now.
general 2020-08-25 04:38:43 the D.I.S. is ready to Hyperjump, sir!
general 2020-08-25 04:41:02 I am at the D.I.S, ready to attempt a Hyperjump to your location.
general 2020-08-25 04:42:41 Hyperjump is now in progress!
general 2020-08-25 04:43:44 Hang on, Reactor is acting up at the D.I.S.
Not sure if we're gonna abort the hyperjump or what.
general 2020-08-25 04:46:04 Update: I have managed to get it in Orbit. Currently at 150000 Kilometers.
general 2020-08-25 04:46:28 Reactor issues are still going on. Meaning I'm not sure if Re-entry will be possible...
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:59:39 I know what I am going to build next in plane crazy.
However, I'm not going to say directly what it is...
If you want a hint, let me know.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:00:23 Want a hint?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:05:54 Is there a spoiler limit? Cause if not then I'll post the hint to my next build in spoilers (so those who want to see it can, and those who don't aren't forced to.)
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:08:16 Firstly, Amazing play.
Secondly, once someone asks for the hint for my next build, I'll post it here.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:10:57 I bet if you do things right, you can make the rocket orbit your target.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:11:34 It'll require co-op from both sides, though
general 2020-09-01 21:21:26 What is going on
general 2020-09-01 21:21:33 I was in class
general 2020-09-01 21:22:11 So, the save data got buffed?
general 2020-09-01 21:22:23 Holy...
general 2020-09-01 21:22:34 4 MILLION
general 2020-09-01 21:23:14 Outlines aren't coming back, but we're getting 16 Times the data
general 2020-09-01 21:24:02 That's one hell of a good deal.
No outlines for a 16 times buff to savedata
general 2020-09-01 21:26:03 What about the Changelog
general 2020-09-01 21:26:13 Will this be mentioned in the changelog?
general 2020-09-01 21:28:00 I second that upvote
general 2020-09-01 22:21:01 How does following the <#490306593242611742> work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 04:04:08 That's easier said than done, though.
