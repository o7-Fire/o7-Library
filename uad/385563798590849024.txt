plane-crazy 2019-09-19 20:56:25 Hmm....what if there was a sonic boom feature on plane crazy....
Yeah people would most likely make crazy fast planes or just troll people by doing tons of sonic booms...so I dont think that would be a good idea...but it also sounds like an awesome idea
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 22:29:29 Finally the Thunderbirds stopped flying over my house....
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 22:31:28 My computer is taking forever to update...its just staying at 0%...

general 2020-02-07 05:02:48 I did not expect it to be this funny-
general 2020-02-07 20:28:39 So, I have a biplane, but, the turning on it is bad, and it keeps going upward when I try to go straight
general 2020-02-07 20:29:01 Any tips on how to fix those things?

plane-crazy 2020-03-06 06:14:00 5 times during practice, 5 times in front of other players

plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:44:28 It sucks you have to buy the speaker....if I had enough robux... I would've had the speaker and be able to host air shows...or like...something idk...
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:45:38 The speaker should be cheaper...
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:46:03 Yeah...
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:47:21 Why didnt they just not make it a game pass if he made a feature where you can just mute certain people with the speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:48:18 And its kinda unfair for people who cant afford the speaker..but want to get it..
plane-crazy 2020-05-13 23:49:17 ?

plane-crazy 2020-11-04 13:02:45 Nordvpn, why?
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 13:02:58 Huh-
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 13:04:09 My only build with a lot of motor locking is my rafale and my j35
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 13:05:22 I haven't revealed half of my new builds to the server bc I'm too lazy to take screenshots and open discord on my laptop

plane-crazy 2020-11-04 13:08:52 Is it me, or is the harrier hard to build
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:11:03 Okay, here's my thought on people who use tutorials, yes, they suck, but you can also learn from those tutorials to improve on your building skills, but if you only use tutorials, yeah you're not getting anywhere
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:13:39 Ngl, when I first played plane crazy, I used tutorials, but now I build things on my own using those skills I learned. And crinje, i know, people who do that are willing to be bullied, laughed at and even called out for it so i suggest to not do that bc basically everyone here can easily recognize a tutorial build
creations-chat 2020-11-04 13:15:28 If you want to be part of the community, try to build on your own, even if it turns out to be garbage, you can still make it better
