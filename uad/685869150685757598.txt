plane-crazy 2022-10-10 16:46:28 are there any people here that have built roller coasters?
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 16:51:10 lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 16:51:16 looks great tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 13:55:37 pc2 should also fix various physics issues since im currently making a build and i need a bi-axis flip mechanism for the build but somehow the physics just disappear whenever i have any solution to my process. the build is already pretty advanced and im trying to figure out how to do this for like 2 or 3 days
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 14:10:29 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 14:11:21 is it seriously never going to release or is that just being said because its being delayed so often?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 14:11:42 ok
