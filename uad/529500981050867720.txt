I  dont know what happened I loaded the same builds on the same day and platform today and they all have missing blocks. I built this car a few days ago and now its missing so many blocks and doesnt work. Edit I also have no blocks for some reason. My ign is kiju100

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 23:05:42 or is it because i have a bad computer
