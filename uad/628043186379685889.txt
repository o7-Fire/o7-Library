help 2022-10-03 23:19:04 i have kind of a strange problem, i was adding turrets to my ship and now the trapdoors i placed are not clickable, i used motor 2s for the turret and the ship folds to create a bigger ship (the trapdoors were working before)
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:31:20 yes
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:31:26 they are unlocked
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:31:28 and unanchored
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:31:37 they worked before i added the the motors
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:32:27 maybe motor 2 is taking focus of the mouse and not letting trap doors open by mouse or some weird scripting thing like that
bug-reports 2022-10-03 23:32:33 ive had this happen on other builds aswell
bug-reports 2022-10-04 00:44:40 try clearing any unused save slots? idrk but maybe ur save data is overflowing or something
bug-reports 2022-10-04 00:45:40 can u save anything apart from your main builds or is everything not saving
bug-reports 2022-10-04 00:46:14 sounds like a corrupted save slot, does autosave work?
bug-reports 2022-10-04 00:47:22 i really have no idea, maybe try turning off autosave in settings? there really isnt anything u can do unless a game dev/mod helps or somebody who can administrate the game
bug-reports 2022-10-04 00:48:25 if that doesnt work try making an alt and saving something
