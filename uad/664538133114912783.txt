plane-crazy 2022-05-22 18:53:42 if i want to make my jet stable and add helium blocks to its nose, wont the jet lift up by it self like when im afk?
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:01:06 how many do you think it should have?
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:01:10 (of helium blocks)
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:01:58 it kinda made a difference but
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:02:22 this is what happens when i add like 4 helium blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:02:36 and made no difference to the stable thingy
plane-crazy 2022-05-22 19:04:40 my jet still wont be stable..

help 2022-07-09 15:45:47 why my camera lock doesnt save when i rejoin or re load my build
help 2022-07-09 18:45:30 so when i did a camera lock and saved it it doesnt really save, i mean when i leave or re load my build the camera isnt in its lock position if you understand
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 18:46:03 can anyone check the help channeo
help 2022-07-09 18:58:43 exactly
help 2022-07-09 18:59:59 since people use camera lock alot cus its useful we cant use it much because if we want to use it it would take ages to finish the locking
creations-chat 2022-07-09 19:00:50 my kart got 30 down votes and 15 upbotes :(((
creations-chat 2022-07-09 19:40:28 because one of the best formula 1 time or the best formula 1 team is ferrari and its italian and since karts look like f1 cars i thought it would be funny
bug-reports 2022-07-10 06:03:01 so when you do a camera angle (like camera lock) it never saves even if i press save, it should happen to most people and its annoying because if you used lots of cam lock then reloading/rejoining that build it would be a pain to re make it.
help 2022-07-10 06:11:33 bro stop being mean and actually help, its not nice to tell  new or bad player '' if i can do those stuff then you can surely do something that simple'' or something, just try and help them instead of trying to flex your builds

creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:12:51 so its technically a russian styled jet rather than nato ones also can you help me with a problem? so: when the rudder of x02s flatters out how can i make it turn right or left since i used the nam nam tut for pvp jets
creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:18:02 <@849139320106516491>
creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:25:20 should my x02s have only one seat? tho xX02s has like a hecka lot of moving parts
creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:30:01 x02s nose

creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:39:21 tho to raise the canards (normal state) i would press t right? but when i spawn the canards at flat which means i need to start making my jet already flat then when i spawn in it goes to its normal state
creations-chat 2022-08-13 09:42:22 it will also have control surfaces so it also helps the canard but my only fear is its weight since its going to be a pvp jet i assume i would have to add thrust vectoring btw heres the image rn

creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:24:51 <@402218785186250763>  ik its cool with animations and all but can you just fucking put the engines side by side with just a bit of motorlocking?

also its not top gun livery because it doesnt have the blue line around the canopy...
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:41:31 trails....

the engines are close to each other 
what you Made was the first image(theres a few blocks separating the engines)
what you need to do is the 2nd image (ik they have a bit of separation but it looks righter with no separation (for the gap maybe just use a wing panel)

thats all ig

general 2022-08-30 18:25:21 something that everyone would recognize (like a jet or something idk)
creations-chat 2022-08-30 18:58:18 how wide and how long is it so far. also how long are you planning it to be
creations-chat 2022-08-30 19:02:20 ik its early but here are the lenght for a carrier to be able to carry 15 lenght, around 7 wide and 5 high jets. aka nowadays jets

1plot or 1.5 plot wide or more
2.5 or more long
the bridge shouldnt be too close to the landing runway so they dont smash
creations-chat 2022-08-30 19:05:31 i meant for other ppl's jets to land maybe, i think your carrier is older like ww2 or early cold war. id say it should be a bit wider and the lenght is fine (it can only allow small propeller planes or something like a mini F-5 to land
creations-chat 2022-08-30 19:07:45 wdym shading and colour variation? whays vert srabs i still dont know

creations-chat 2022-10-06 17:18:22 we all agree on your opinion but we don't agree the way you see it, you see anime as some femboy show, then lets say your country is about guns and its trash, then that would make us wrong about the way we see it. you're just following stereotypes
creations-chat 2022-10-06 17:23:35 now you're stereotyping shows, then why are you playing roblox if its just a "kids blocks game" then?

creations-chat 2023-01-02 14:19:59 i might just ask the opinion to thrizet as he builds ro scales and built a su 35
creations-chat 2023-01-02 14:44:56 seems pretty accurate now
creations-chat 2023-01-02 16:14:27 can you tell me the 3 colours you used? (nose belly and primary colour pls_
creations-chat 2023-01-02 16:30:43 mind telling me how your plane is going to roll
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:09:52 oh i should do that too
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:31:02 i used control surfaces (1 sheet) might add another because its pretty slow but it might turn too fast then..
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:33:40 <@773474989751664640> from above it looks pretty smooth but when you look under...pretty messed up but landing gear has hiding spots atleast



oh btw before you say it yes its blueprint accurate i checked
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:39:23 compared to my other and only flanker (scroll up in my creations) its a pretty big imrpovement and um here

overall seems pretty accurate
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:42:43 oh btw lots of springs are getting stuck into my fuselage and stuff, anything i can do about it?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:46:43 the fact that i took 20 minutes to find one makes me wanna cry and um can you suggest me one i could try and get?
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:48:46 they're now connected to the engine but not alligned or else the landing gear would look too close to each other


OR i can ignore to put hiding spots for the landing gear and the the gear exposed outside which i wouldn't really care btu im pretty sure the pcc will cancel me for that
creations-chat 2023-01-02 17:51:35 imma delete my intakes since um they're shit

creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:57:03 im making a x02s, are the intakes separate enough?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 10:59:28 the engines will be huge is yeah this will avoid them from touching (the engines) because of what happened to my su 35 before
creations-chat 2023-01-08 11:11:27 which nose for my x02s?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:21:52 wdym
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:35:56 are the intakes for my x02s too low or nah?
creations-chat 2023-01-08 18:08:02 what plane even is that lol
creations-chat 2023-01-08 18:11:21 ok ok also um i really wanted to angle lock the wings but im lazy

i wish i ahd the jetpack, its hard to build this way...
creations-chat 2023-01-08 18:18:33 ignore the intakes this is how it looks so far yes ik shit but its time to overlay it
creations-chat 2023-01-08 18:23:33 from my overlay, the nose has to be longer and the canopy one block forward, the wings and canard need a little restructoration
creations-chat 2023-01-08 20:07:18 <@682654950618431508> ah yes dotn forget you cant post a wip in <#384025409945337856> , just note that also this wont end unless im here
creations-chat 2023-01-09 17:02:21 so i'm making a x02s, and um i dont know what's wrong with this but it just looks very odd to me

help 2023-01-10 19:28:04 nice
help 2023-01-11 05:40:29 basically you use magnets to put your build in one piece (motorlock basically)
creations-chat 2023-01-11 16:08:54 for the sake of my x02's elevators being able to angle, should i make my elevators not work?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 16:11:07 ok so yes i wont make them functioning
creations-chat 2023-01-11 18:49:44 so you this is the first actual plane you built? (except the tutorials we probably all used once and huge blocks with wings on it) pretty impressive but if you want to build accurate builds you should overlay it to a blueprint (unless its custom ofc) but either ways just keep going you might eventually get better

might also learn to hide some exposed lock but that will come later
creations-chat 2023-01-11 18:52:14 i dont think this text is very very useful, you should just use disconnectors and disconnect the stick part so it hides the back

creations-chat 2023-02-09 20:50:27 <@919641357725872220> you should just put no flag on it, just because it can promote things good or bad its not really good to put flags especially on builds that yk.

if you made like a gripen adding a small sweden decal would be harmless



just remember not to put flags about the 2 countries that aren't really happy at each other (yk them) for political reasons

creations-chat 2023-02-15 20:38:05 im sorry to tell you but most of your plane crazy life in this server will be a lot of ''delete it'' ''re-start''
creations-chat 2023-02-16 16:52:45 guys um since i cant find any way to make a good super hornet intake should i just screw it and make smoke pipe intake?

(and adding a little bit of piston lock to make it "special")
creations-chat 2023-02-16 17:05:36 wait 5 seconds after pushing the pistons, then releasing the spring or disconnectors
creations-chat 2023-02-16 17:10:08 it isnt made for pvp
creations-chat 2023-02-16 17:13:30 you can try adding explosive blocks around the pistoned area (motorlock) since they cant be destroyed it kinda defends the piston lock from being attacked
creations-chat 2023-02-16 17:26:28 ill just convert it back to a legacy one
bug-reports 2023-02-16 17:36:57 um the game makes no fucking sense

so when im motorlocking basically and the thing im motorlocking (a intake) is too high by half a block, so logically i would put the intake one block lower and motorlock half a block up, but when i do that the intake is 1 block fucking lower (which means that if i didnt use the motorlock it would 1.5 blocks lower than the height it was before instead of 0.5 which should have been the correct height)
creations-chat 2023-02-16 18:43:53 deserves an upvote in my opinion

creations-chat 2023-03-12 13:07:15 <@335406521896927233> nice f22 and all but..

1) you shouldn't use control surfaces (custom) since they look pretty ugly, instead you can motorlock the classic control surfaces binded to W and S inside or on the wings of the airplane and to the wings for the Roll controls, same with the rudder (just put the surfaces horizontally)

2) ik its good for the plane but remove the trap doors and use normal wing panels, it makes the plane look lower effort rather than higher effort

3) you may also want to kinda perfectize the intakes' entrance wing panels since theres gaps

4) is just my opinion btw but you should change the afterburner colour to orange or make it more "noticable"


anyways gl with your next version of your f22





PS: where's um landing gear i never seen it
