general 2023-03-11 04:21:59 What should be subtracted from xÂ²-xy+yÂ²-x+y+3 to obtain -xÂ²+3yÂ²-4xy+1?
=>(xÂ²-xy+yÂ²-x+y+3)-z=(-xÂ²+3yÂ²-4xy+1)
=>(xÂ²-xy+yÂ²-x+y+3)-(-xÂ²+3yÂ²-4xy+1)=z
=>xÂ²-xy+yÂ²-x+y+3+xÂ²-3yÂ²+4xy-1=z
=>2xÂ²+3xy-2yÂ²-x+y+2=z
.:.(xÂ²-xy+yÂ²-x+y+3)-(2xÂ²+3xy-2yÂ²-x+y+2)=(-xÂ²+3yÂ²-4xy+1)
