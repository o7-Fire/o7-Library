creations-chat 2022-05-14 19:54:07 ok so what would be the better and easier option, also if i used motor2s, then how will i make it run
help 2022-05-15 16:21:12 so im trying to make a thing where there are mortor2s and wherever i point i want to go there by using propellers. but the motor2s keep flinging everywhere, like going side to side on their own, even if i replace the propellers with a conveyor engine, it  still flings around side to side, any help?
