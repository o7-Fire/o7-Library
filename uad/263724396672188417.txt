plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:01:26 so apparently, half wedge 2, even though it isnt a full block, sticks to rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:01:41 so i just built a rocket stage seperation, and it wont work because the blocks are connecting
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:01:49 so now i have to rebuilt the whole thing by 1 block bigger, wooho
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:01:55 yes
