plane-crazy 2020-07-17 01:50:36 i wonder if the propeller is made out of lots of little props
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 06:53:48 is it just me or is it so much harder to build planes than anything else
it's just so hard to focus on the look on the plane while making sure it actually works
general 2020-07-17 07:22:43 my god wtf
general 2020-07-17 07:23:09 it's like you murdered a duck by dissecting it alive why

help 2020-07-21 20:40:21 let me see
help 2020-07-21 20:40:47 take a screenshot
help 2020-07-21 20:42:43 only those two?
help 2020-07-21 20:44:53 if you also use a custom propeller in the inside you need to sdd a second unpowered motor or else the singular motor can make the craft unstable
help 2020-07-21 20:45:33 also try configuring the helium and ballast blocks
help 2020-07-21 20:45:40 that may be the problem
help 2020-07-21 20:46:14 maybe if the ballast blocks are heavier it can stop the craft from capsizing
help 2020-07-21 20:48:05 is it only when you turn the main engines on?
help 2020-07-21 20:54:51 i was about to say to check the engines
help 2020-07-21 20:55:02 set them both to disable on or off only mode

help 2020-07-21 20:55:47 i don't think you can
help 2020-07-21 20:57:18 the whole plane was folded
help 2020-07-21 21:00:04 make a separate save without any ballast or helium since it might impact the pitch of the blimp
help 2020-07-21 21:00:35 if the tail is too heavy try adding helium to the tail and ballast to the bow
help 2020-07-21 21:02:58 you should also try positioning the engines "nearer" to the center of the craft since both engines are near the bottom they create all propulsion to the bottom and pitches the nose up if you put them more on the center instead of near the ground it should balance out your zeppelin
help 2020-07-21 21:03:56 how do i join you

help 2020-12-29 22:00:36 for rank requests do you have to remove astethic blocks as they do nothing and add to the block count?
help 2020-12-29 22:02:30 no like for example:

You are building a ship and make a little "engine" that does nothing and is just for looks. Do you have to remove that for it to count?

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 08:30:07 Tip:

The turrets seem way too big for the ship, this is the way i designed mine (without the outside blocks) and people’s criticism below. https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/478584971670454284/793272287583404052

general 2021-02-21 07:52:34 Why is stacking rockets bad?
general 2021-02-21 07:54:59 I was designing a ship and someone said that i shouldnt put a rocket launcher in front of another
general 2021-02-21 07:55:05 So
general 2021-02-21 07:55:21 Ah
help 2021-02-21 08:03:27 Why is putting two rocket (launchers) in a formation like the picture bad? Is it bad if i do it with the guns too? Am sleepy, pls ping
general 2021-02-21 08:03:50 Lol remember when the save cap was 250,000
general 2021-02-21 08:04:10 Now it’s 4 million
help 2021-02-21 08:10:54 Example: my ship turret a few months ago
help 2021-05-02 02:58:29 These provide no thrust whatsoever even when under water
for some reason placing more under these makes the craft go backwards
it is placed 1-2 blocks below the bottom
help 2021-05-02 04:11:14 so how do i fix it
telling me to get better doesn't really provide an answer
help 2021-05-02 04:12:22 those are 3x3's and 2x2's
and they do not move the ship at all
i have the same amount of props at the rear and they move the ship
help 2021-05-02 04:23:13 I havent seen any
what does it even look like
help 2021-05-02 04:23:22 a sphere for sure lol

plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:10:54 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:12:33 This behaviour is expected on a platform mostly oriented towards kids
