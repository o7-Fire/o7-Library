plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:08:56 i was doing that unconciously when i was making the nose
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:09:30 instead of using the half weldge, i was motor locking a half wedge up and a half block üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-05-01 14:10:56 üíÄ

plane-crazy 2022-05-02 06:15:13 i've been test flying before i finish things up and i've found that using wing panels for the intakes make my plane tilt while controling my roll

what other block can i use for my intakes, it's affecting my flight <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 11:29:30 i dont see the angle lock

plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:14:40 i'll do it
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:14:42 too
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:14:47 it might vary with the
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:14:52 item's weight
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:16:25 oh and the motor's locked
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:18:07 i think it'd work on hover based vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:18:18 so that you won't have to worry about balancing
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:21:33 it's less laggy if it isnt locked
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:25:04 
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:25:47 just turn the contraption around
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:25:53 make the motors on the back
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:26:02 i think it'd be somewhat practical for big spaceships
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:26:15 since it takes a lot of space it should be fine for them eh?
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:27:50 
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:29:13 here
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 09:29:18 want me to add a beam?

general 2022-06-11 06:42:02 5 feet 1 inches tall
According to newer ROBLOX measurements, 1 Stud is 0.28 meters. Therefore, a Roblox character (that is actually 5.5 studs tall) is 154 cm or 5 feet 1 inches tall.
general 2022-06-11 06:50:18 how many studs is a block?
general 2022-06-11 06:54:30 so a half block is 1.25 studs
general 2022-06-11 06:54:44 width wise
general 2022-06-11 06:54:56 it is still 2.5
general 2022-06-11 06:55:17 a character fits in a 2 block high area
general 2022-06-11 06:55:46 which is 5 studs
general 2022-06-11 06:59:54 i don't get it, because a roblox character is 5.5 studs tall. but it fits in an area that is 2 blocks tall (5 studs)
general 2022-06-11 07:01:09 what?
general 2022-06-11 07:01:52 According to the ROBLOX Blog, 1 meter is equal to 20 ROBLOX studs, so a stud is 5 centimeters, and a real-life ROBLOXian (that is 5 studs tall) would be 25 centimeters, about 10 inches tall.

????????
general 2022-06-11 07:02:46 if you look up "how many inches is a roblox stud" and "how tall is a roblox character"
they give different results
general 2022-06-11 07:05:19 neither

general 2022-06-11 07:22:08 rounded off to 11.1
help 2022-06-16 01:02:39 if it's a pilot seat you can control your creation
creations-chat 2022-06-16 02:10:16 not possible

you can try a locked powered motor with the setting reset on

then use a block to stop the motor from moving more than the angle of what you want it to be
