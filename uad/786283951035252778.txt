general 2020-12-14 18:05:45 Lancaster is the most modern
general 2020-12-14 18:07:04 But was there ever a jet powered B-29?

general 2020-12-14 18:08:32 Nyooom!
general 2020-12-14 18:10:08 Everybody gangsta till the Avro Lancaster proves to be superior to the B-29 due to it only needing minor modification to be nuclear capable whilst the B-29 needed many modifications to do so
general 2020-12-14 18:10:55 Shhhhhh
general 2020-12-14 18:11:07 But are they British guns?
general 2020-12-14 18:12:03 And the Lancasters bomb load was superior in comparison to the B-29s until the nuclear capable ones came about
general 2020-12-14 18:13:17 But you don't need to be breaking the sound barrier in a bomber
general 2020-12-14 18:13:41 No
general 2020-12-14 18:13:56 Imagine even having bombers in your air force
general 2020-12-14 18:15:21 Lancaster is best, it doesn't need a fuselage to fly but is instead guided by the hand of Churchill himself
