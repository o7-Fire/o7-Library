bug-reports 2021-09-08 12:54:00 When I tried to make the chomping mechanism for my Beyblade, the Beyblade yeetes itself in a random direction when closing the jaws with a piston facing down.
Steps: make a 5×5 cylinder and 2 1×1 cylinders on too of each other, with some rockets to rotate it. Put a facing down piston on toggle with another 5×5 on it. Spin it and Toggle the piston up and down.
