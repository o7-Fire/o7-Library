plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:21:45 A
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:25:53 i made a B17 that has the worst tail
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:26:46 fuck that jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:28:00 E
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:28:43 furios
plane-crazy 2022-07-05 08:30:05 M O A I
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:14:54 is this nose accurate?
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:15:06 i have a feeling i am missing something
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:15:14 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:15:54 umm i am making a B17
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:16:22 i tried to make the nose a bit more accurate then my last B17
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:16:45 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:17:13 making the back of the B17 will be very hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:19:12 yea
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:19:22 i have to figure out the size of the wings
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:24:10 my brain is damaged already i do not know the width of the wings ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:25:30 ok nvm its 6 blocks long
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:25:33 or 7
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:27:49 watch a landing gear tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:27:59 so you can get the idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:29:29 trapdoor landing gears are better
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:30:03 its easy
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:30:32 just make a 1x1 landing gear then motorlock the trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 04:30:46 easy as that
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 05:34:17 i finally finished my B17 fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 05:34:39 copy moment
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 06:50:11 I FINALLY FINISHED MY B17
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:09:00 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:09:25 EVEN THE FUSELAGE
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:09:46 i dont use any tutorials at all
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:11:10 the look is almost the same but  it has a lot of difference
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:12:06 bro i don't use the tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:12:54 tail gunner
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:13:07 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:13:12 i use a 3d model
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:13:33 and the tail gunner is on the vertical stab
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:14:02 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:14:43 my brain was damaged when trying to make the tail gunner
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:15:04 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:15:27 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:15:42 at least it flies better then the tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:16:42 and there is no helium blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 08:23:54 when i find out how to use a rudder properly:
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 08:24:06 q and e
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 08:24:57 well making a perfect lock is not easy
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 02:47:15 funi looking tank
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:50:18 funi short carrier
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:50:56 e
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:51:44 depends on lag
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:52:10 if its so laggy then the plane will wobble violently
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:52:53 use 3d models
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:53:07 and speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-20 01:54:42 try making it simple
