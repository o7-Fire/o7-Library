general 2021-11-18 16:07:26 Guys I need an F in chat. I almost got mod for a 100k discord server of a roblox game with 10k active players daily.
general 2021-11-18 16:07:46 I was literally soooo close.
general 2021-11-18 16:08:43 I’ve been in the community for 3 years and I don’t despite it except for the toxicity.
general 2021-11-18 16:09:52 I was literally recommended by 2 mods to be a mod and the community managers like my application but they didn’t see it before they posted the new mods. They don’t wanna ping the server again since they already said it ended. Now I have to wait 6 months (estimate) to re apply.
general 2021-11-18 16:10:14 L and F in chat pleaseeee
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 20:28:31 This game is really good. Community is way to toxic/sarcastic.
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 20:28:48 Point proven.
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 20:29:06 Nah I just used my freedom of speech
