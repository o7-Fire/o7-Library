general 2023-04-07 02:42:59 did rick just never find a developer to create the map
general 2023-04-07 02:49:16 there was a dev post "
Hiring map builder(s) to build a massive optimized map. (Plane Crazy)" so I thought they where at trying to get something new
general 2023-04-07 02:51:00 I mean this post would make it seem like hes just paying someone to do the hard work for him as it can be boring building and they can afford it
