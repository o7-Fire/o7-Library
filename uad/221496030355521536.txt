plane-crazy 2018-12-15 09:09:53 Oh no it's not
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 09:10:15 It only feezed the server for a solid 30 seconds
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:36:59 It's broken lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-15 20:37:03 I can't see anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:05:23 Sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:06:37 It's on <#501059272675688468>
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:06:49 server by Vipempire
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:06:57 it's pinned I think
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:45 The lorry is based off of the Volvo FH and has 3 trailers: a low loader, vehicle transporter and a DHL box trailer. All trailers are attached to the truck with magnets. Requesting expert builder and expert engineer
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:46 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:00:47 
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:04:38 It's a magnet that's connected to a non-powered motor
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:05:06 Sometimes it can be a pain to hitch the trailer because there is only one specific spot where it welds
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:05:24 Yeah I tried doing that and it was somewhat glitchy
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:10 I see
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:42 It worked on the Low loader because it's light but the DHL box one is super heavy and it breaks the pistons
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:06:53 So I just switched all to magnets
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:07:50 Well I like using the magnets because once they weld it's not coming off
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:08:07 Even though sometimes it won't come off even after deactivating the magnets lol
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:08:24 They work but unreliable af
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:06 no
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:22 I'm still making changes to the truck as I go
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:09:47 The lights are supposed to be at the far edges of the truck but it looks ugly because of the light shape
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:10:52 Oh they don't
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:11:03 I have a little skidplate thingy
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:11:15 I don't think you can see it in the screenshots
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:12:07 there
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:12:30 I should probably add a bumper though
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:18:43 ye
creations-chat 2018-12-16 21:19:02 It's on <#501059272675688468> , the pinned one by vipempire

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:37:54 Please tell me bigger wheels are one of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 21:38:06 :(
general 2018-12-17 16:04:19 You can't use them at all now when it comes to controlling planes
general 2018-12-17 16:05:02 They start flopping around even when I only use them for 0.000001 seconds on my eurofighter

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 20:15:02 I'm building the train from TG

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:50:49 Takumi's, i mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:53:34 ok where is it
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:53:53 That ain't it chief
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:54:05 Not that
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:54:08 I mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:54:22 That's the gauge cluster
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:54:50 Later in the show, he got a new engine, capable of reaching 11k rpm
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:54:56 So he needed a new tach
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:55:13 I don't think he did
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 07:56:18 lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 10:27:44 I'm making mako and sayuki's Sileighty soon so maybe

general 2018-12-18 16:12:40 apparently the p202 is too much for discord
general 2018-12-18 16:12:45 He162
general 2018-12-18 16:12:48 I got dat
general 2018-12-18 16:12:55 Not really
general 2018-12-18 16:13:02 I have one but it's meh
general 2018-12-18 16:13:53 That's what i was tryiung to send
general 2018-12-18 16:16:02 German: "you know how the americans got that P38? it's like two planes combined".
Engineer/designer: "lol"
the-dump 2018-12-18 18:22:34 I have the best card by far but I'm keeping it for extreme situations
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 18:34:05 A racetack with these loops would be the best thing ever
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:30:41 how the fuck do you make a rope storm
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:30:56 ok then
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:30:59 but i just did
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:31:05 well
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:31:21 I did everything exactly like inferno did and it works like shit
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:51:17 Apart for the hood which sucks, how does it look?
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:51:28 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:51:47 Wow thanks
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:52:18 The fenders were kind of a pain to make tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:52:36 Yeah, after 6 tries
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:52:58 Nah I'm probably gonna be making a GT40 next

plane-crazy 2018-12-18 22:54:26 I wanted to make a giant PC sometime but never got around to actually do it
general 2018-12-18 23:51:57 You can't make one, not in a way that i've heard of
general 2018-12-18 23:52:40 I've tried like 4 different ways and all of them don't work/work very poorly
general 2018-12-19 00:17:28 Can you show a screenshot?
general 2018-12-19 00:17:36 Also how many cylinders
general 2018-12-19 00:18:10 I2 is easy
general 2018-12-19 00:18:22 I'm talking about a 4 cylinder+
general 2018-12-19 00:19:04 I'm not gonna use it in something because it's way too big
general 2018-12-19 00:19:11 I just do it becasue it's cool
general 2018-12-19 00:21:59 The problem is when you make a 3 cylinder or above engine, is that the crankshaft just breaks
general 2018-12-19 00:22:13 It has to be one piece, without a single motor
general 2018-12-19 00:23:02 I have a 'smooth' prototype rn but it breaks thanks to roblox physics

plane-crazy 2018-12-19 14:52:55 Should've been like 5 between
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 14:54:41 I made this car to fit on the rails, and it barely leaves any space for the carriages because I assume folding isn't possible on rails
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 14:55:32 Yeah I'll have room for like one carriage 'maybe' if I fold vertical
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 14:56:15 Yeah

plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:05:03 That has no room for carriages at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:05:14 which was my point earlier
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:05:22 Were exactly?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:05:27 Where
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:06:01 Let's assume that you can't fold to the side beacause it's on rails
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:06:21 Vertical folding will get you nowhere
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:06:57 But that's stupid
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:07:04 and might throw the train off the rails
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 15:07:26 All the carriages are connected right?
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 18:49:20 it won't be brakes anymore

plane-crazy 2018-12-20 19:27:58 But EVERYONE who has a 109 or 262 from yt uses it just as is, maybe slam all rockets and guns on that bitch and that's it

creations-chat 2019-01-09 15:53:28 exactly
creations-chat 2019-01-09 15:55:02 This looks interesting, but in the end it's just a motor kicking a ball
creations-chat 2019-01-09 15:55:18 Grablador made a working lock, THAT's worthy of inventor

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 15:58:13 Well you can either wait untill rick rewrites the whole game which will probably take months if not years, OR just make it smaller
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 15:58:54 <#501059272675688468>

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:45:32 the car?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:45:57 Somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:46:16 It's the Charger Daytona, based off of the Dodge Charger
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:46:23 WHICH is the lee
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:47:06 also kratos do you think it needs bigger wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:47:58 Yeah I should probably do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:48:16 They are
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:48:30 front are 2 wide, rear are 3
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:48:37 And yeah Ik that's pretty thin
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:49:09 But the turning will suck If I use wider tires
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:51:14 are the bombs just let loose in the bomb bay?
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:39:10 No offence fun but you could also climb that mountain with a 15 block stick car
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:41:58 lolwut
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:42:04 The stick car will be lighter
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:42:12 Therefore, it will be able to go faster
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:42:30 Ok so I'll spam the stick car with helium too
plane-crazy 2019-01-10 14:42:49 Also that contradicts your "only wheels"

plane-crazy 2019-01-12 18:09:50 and one rope will push it up
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 18:10:05 that way it also won't move to the side because the springs don't pivot

plane-crazy 2019-01-15 14:32:48 I'd rather not, because unfolding it would take forever, and welding isn't always accurate

creations-chat 2019-01-16 16:38:31 weird
creations-chat 2019-01-16 16:38:50 I build lots of cars, and have never encountered 'unjustified' lag
creations-chat 2019-01-16 16:39:27 like it lags when I build 2k+ parts cars because the game engine can't handle it but it's not a car related issue
creations-chat 2019-01-16 16:40:30 also the wheels can barely handle the weight of a 300 parts car
creations-chat 2019-01-16 16:40:44 just use boosters/jets for added speed and acceleration
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 16:41:12 helicopters are big gay
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 16:42:18 make a really simple object and post it in <#504436696021204992> so you could get 30+ upvotes
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:43:33 <#504436696021204992>
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:43:48 it's a good looking osprey but it had to be done
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:44:23 same
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:44:53 your what
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:46:08 747s are pretty uncommon since they're so big
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:46:40 and when someone does build a 747, it's mostly a shit looking jet with a hump on top of it
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:46:58 I don't consider these to be 747s
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:47:41 ok
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:47:52 honestly what are you expecting
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:48:14 someone placed a fucking BLOCK and got 30+ upvotes
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:48:46 
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:48:49 54!!!!
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:48:51 WHAT THE FUCK
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:49:40 my best creation has like 13 upvotes
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:50:24 no one votes on <#384025409945337856> unless it's some bullshit 'HAHA I BUILT A REALLY SIMPLE OBJECT GUYS PLEASE UPVOTE ME PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE'
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:50:59 yeah
the-dump 2019-01-16 16:52:52 what's moderating amirite

plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:30:42 Like, do they not jiggle
help 2019-01-16 19:31:10 Does it kinda 'teleport' before welding?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:31:46 They were very good when they were fixed
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:31:55 like you can make any plane a fucking stunt plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:32:27 I made a GPU a while ago
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:33:53 wait so he broke magnets or what
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:35:09 oh it's this guy
help 2019-01-16 19:35:42 Yeah it happens to weld unaligned a lot
help 2019-01-16 19:36:11 You need to fully unfold it, activate the magnet and then 'feather' the folding
help 2019-01-16 19:36:15 If that makes any sense
help 2019-01-16 19:36:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:36:50 what
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:36:56 I thought it was a 109
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:37:12 that's nto a mustang lmao
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:37:21 the mustang has a bubble cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:37:46 
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:37:58 it just sticks out of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:38:06 what version
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 19:38:37 o
help 2019-01-16 19:39:43 Basically all folding creations use magnets to lock the fold
help 2019-01-16 19:39:54 And I don't think toggle is really good for this
help 2019-01-16 19:42:34 <#501034677793193994> has some useful information
help 2019-01-16 19:42:44 it's mostly aimed at starters though

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:12:34 Ye but they're gonna be LONG
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:13:11 O really?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:13:33 Also if it's 3.75x your 747
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:13:53 You cant even fit the fuselage in the build zone
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:14:04 Unless you fold like 478642377 times
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:14:09 Show
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:14:54 Your 747 is 4 folds right?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:15:10 O
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:15:45 btw are you still making that 380?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 07:15:53 rip
creations-chat 2019-01-17 07:32:24 It should, I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:34:17 <@!298129144422858752> lol

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:37:47 RIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:38:00 How many parts was it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:39:18 YES PLEAS
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:39:42 Also a lock system if possible
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:40:27 the lock?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:40:45 o
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 09:40:56 it would be a lifesaver for dumb people like me

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:01:30 <@!217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:02:08 here's the log
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:04:19 someone with a train got stuck in it lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:04:59 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:09:41 rejoined the server and someone else is there now
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:14:15 easiest way to get light speed is to: 
1) load a folding creation
2) go to your motors' torque and set that bitch to a 1000
3) spawn and don't let go of the unfold button
4) ????
5) profit
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:16:10 2 servers in a row, the third one came shortly after
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:16:11 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:16:11 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:16:28 how hard is it to speak FUCKING ENGLISH
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:17:24 no
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:17:57 yeah but helium is if you really want the rank
creations-chat 2019-01-17 10:18:12 and you can't get lightspeed with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:24:46 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:25:25 It happened to me as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:25:31 ONE MONTH????
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:25:46 how fucking big was it damn
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:26:07 you mean 3 folds?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:27:24 The most it took me to make a 3 fold creation was like 4-6 days
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:27:31 from start to finish
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:28:31 how much time did you work on it in total
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:28:49 I mean in-game
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:29:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:40:20 rick make a way to yeet these people to death
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:40:27 like votekick or someth
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:41:12 it can go around the whole base
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:41:22 but it hit my wing of my tu4 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:41:30 who needs blacklisting
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:43:14 nice rudder
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:47:01 the 2nd one, but not right now
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:48:11 the same guy thinks he can make a better nose cone than I can
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:48:12 
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:50:22 "I would show you but I'm out of save data"
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:50:46 *pulls out incomplete plane and proceeds to build it*
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:53:08 I'm switching between public servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:53:19 it got deleted <@!451739682686894081>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:53:48 If you want to make a suggestion, type &suggest in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:54:11 Yeah I don't know
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 10:54:40 The old layout was much better in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:00:18 Outside is done, now I need to make the inside and make this shit fly
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:01:43 meh
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:01:53 I prefer to have the propeller motors non powered
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:01:59 Because they spin faster
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:02:02 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:02:19 how bout
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:02:23 **no**
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:03:00 That's what I do
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:03:33 The only plane I use powered propellers for is the 109Z, because they get stuck if they're non-powered
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:04:20 why
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:04:37 because it works like shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:04:54 Why have 2 different propulsion systems
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:05:29 Only propellers?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:05:38 That's fine then
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:05:54 But propellers aren't going to move my plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:05:59 no fucking way
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:06:59 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 11:11:20 gonna join community 2 in a sec

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:33:30 It makes your creation invisible to people you've blacklisted
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:36:11 Yeah people used it to make creations invisible  in pvp but I think it's fixed now
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:37:22 I've destroyed a lot of shitty turrets with my bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:37:37 also you can hit them when they actually launch it
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:42:42 Next winter, instead of bothering with all that winter wheel/chain shit, just wrap your wheel with fucking fabric
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 13:57:52 someone guess what this is

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 15:26:24 they need to add an indicator for when someone is using light theme
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 15:26:33 and then we just do a mass purge of them

creations-chat 2019-01-17 17:37:48 The Tupolev Tu-4
-Almost 2.5k blocks
-Working bomb bay doors
-Detailed cockpit/interior 
-Fully retractable landing gear (doors not included, but are planned)
-Max speed of 400 SPS

The plane has 8 one block bombs and 4 tnt block "nuke", and it will send every tutorial 262 & 109 to gulag.
The livery of the plane is based off of 'The Gulag Express'. A livery made by Rulo6000, a War Thunder youtuber. (If you want the link to the livery for use in WT, dm me)
creations-chat 2019-01-17 17:37:48 
creations-chat 2019-01-17 17:38:13 Here's the livery, if anyone's interested
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 17:46:25 bbbbbbbbbbbb
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:11:36 wow people are actually voting for something I made for once
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:17:18 does it need to be retractable?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:18:26 I can't make a landing gear that actually works so I just have this placeholder
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:18:45 by works I mean works AND fits in this space
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:22:18 l0nge 109
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:53:02 do i need to say anything
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:54:56 well he was the first to submit
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 09:55:21 and most people who submit first get in the top 3 at least
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:09:22 has someone made a landing gear like this before?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:11:36 I haven't started yet but I already know that I can't make it
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:21:16 thanks!

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:35:58 Canadair CL-415
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:42:04 I'm building it right now
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:42:33 
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:42:56 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:42:58 I could try
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:43:04 thanks for the help btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:49:45 man, building this plane reminds me of why I stuck to building cars in this game
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:51:52 I like planes, but the ones I try to build are either hard/come out looking like shit when I build them
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:52:25 I have a few ww2 planes already
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:52:59 A18 Shrike, TU-4, He-162, 109Z and 110
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:53:09 not a fan of jets tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:54:44 the 109z is basically 2 109s combined
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 10:55:19 I think I'll kill myself before I manage to do the cockpit for the 111 but I might do the Ju-87
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:12:00 I have a really good steering system in my F40 but then I can't use real suspension
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:20:05 vip 1
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:20:08 I think
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:27:38 I think vip needed a landing gear as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:27:47 wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 11:27:53 WHO CRASHED THE SERVER

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:29:04 
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:29:11 cockpit will be done at a later time btw
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:29:23 oof
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:29:32 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:30:18 yeah the rear is the only part i'm pleased with tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:30:51 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:34:35 making a cockpit is an art in this game lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:36:55 <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:46:39 shooti bang bang was my bad attempt at making a locking cannon/rifle/shooti thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:46:48 Disclaimer: it didn't go well
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:48:01 ok time to do the cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 12:48:06 and probably kill myself afterwards

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:06:27 I don't like making airliners tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:07:08 The only one I might actually make is a DC-10 but probably not tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:07:36 maybe
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 13:08:28 You want to know how to get the upvote ranks the fastest?

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 14:16:18 If you made a flying blender and wanted to make a rank for it (like me) you have to show proof
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 14:16:30 If it's a plane then 99% you don't need to show proof
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 14:16:34 <#501059272675688468>

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 14:20:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 14:21:21 when you get your first rank, you get a 'ranked' rank

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:53:49 I had a magnet motor (not drive) which caused me to drop to 5 fps
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:53:56 now i get full 60 all the way
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:54:42 It's probably fixed only for low block count builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:55:02 cause if I activate the magnets on my folding cars, I drop to 7
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:55:31 ?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:06 I just said
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:08 not magnet drive
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:21 also when I meant the magnets on my car, it was for locking the fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:26 not for propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 15:56:57 they don't even work on my car anymore lmao

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:20:38 Do you need one with 3x3 cylindrs or custom BIG wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:20:42 because I got both
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:21:18 lemme make a quick example
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:22:30 that's the most basic one you can make
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:22:34 wait shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:22:45 ignore the drawing
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:23:31 anyway, you can add things like suspension, anti roll bars and so on but it gets cumbersome, escpecially for this type of wheels
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:23:52 reset option  should do just fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:24:52 np

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 10:10:07 I use wing panels because you can have an odd number for the blade length
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 10:10:20 if that makes any sense
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 10:10:56 not if you want it to move

plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:32:11 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:32:43 what do you mean by 'they don't fly'
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:33:29 you can make anything fly in this game tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:33:37 so i don't get what's the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:33:51 nah xpert
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:33:56 i made a blender fly, no helium
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:34:02 just wings and super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:34:12 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:34:31 fact
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:35:06 shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:35:26 xpert you need to change it to 'almost anything'
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:37:20 technically you could attack 9999999 super rockets to the bank and make it fly away
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 21:37:27 attach*

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:31:11 does it fold?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:31:58 do the wheels have suspension and shit?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:32:07 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:32:37 something in the landing gear might be touching something else
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:32:43 and that makes the motors unhappy
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:34:31 dc10

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:35:35 MD-A380
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:36:52 thicc
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:37:38 you can ask a mod separately for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:37:51 but it's easier to request it within the submission
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:38:08 does it fly?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:38:36 
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:38:47 I think you can only ask for advanced
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:38:51 because it's land based
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:41:00 remove the landing gear and try flying it
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 10:42:12 that SU looks very epic

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 15:03:01 the gulag express is notorious for destroying these disgusting tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 15:03:14 and then sending the builders to gulag

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:27:59 not when you're only using super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 16:28:32 I wanted to test it and built a car solely out of rockets

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:39:07 People make a lot of ships lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:39:20 It's probably the most common folding creation in this game
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:50:14 mad attack
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:50:59 a10s are gay
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:51:09 so many of them have been made in this game
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:52:17 a10s and ospreys are the most common aircraft in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:52:33 though the ospreys seem to have calmed down a bit
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:52:43 because barely anyone makes the P-51
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:53:04 meh
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:53:08 they're not that common
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:53:29 also most 109s are from that shitty tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:57:20 you mean these?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 17:58:12 gotta give credit though, the nose isn't just a flat piece of glass

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:20:30 I can also make the tail engine mount explode
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:20:58 and the door can also 'fly off' somewhat, and have explosive decompression
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:21:03 cargo door, that is
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:21:27 lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:21:49 I would have actual blade engines but the casing is too small
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:21:59 plus it looks much better with the ingame engines
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:22:07 3x3 i think
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:22:35 that's what i have

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:28:19 someone did make a flex tape boat
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:28:25 but it looked like shit i think
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:28:54 more like 1.99
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:29:26 how much is a roll of flex tape
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:29:56 it's 5.99
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:30:04 so the boat itself is 5.99
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:30:27 wait shit nvm
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:30:47 it's 12
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:31:08 
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:32:01 but these ones are the UNITS that hold the boat together
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:32:08 and keep the inside completely dry
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:32:14 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:50:08 like these?
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:50:38 it's between 'bad' to 'meh'
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:50:48 I'd rather just use 2 blade or 4 blade
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:54:38 this is where im at with my pixel art lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-01 21:54:50 and yes it's gonna fold

plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:07:01 read the last 3
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:07:23 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:07:27 some public server
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:07:40 https://www.roblox.com/users/949571582/profile
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:08:03 lol what
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:08:20 oof he left
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:08:29 that was very entertaining to read lmao
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:08:56 he is
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:09:10 
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:09:11 idk
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:21:15 h
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:21:42 Remember i made an h like 2 weeks ago?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:21:51 now i made a heavy duty h
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 19:55:55 make it 6-8 blocks longer
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:24:50 is it gonna be a jet or prop?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:25:04 ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:26:11 how so?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:26:26 do the parts intersect with each other when you unfold?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:28:42 looks unnecessary
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:29:11 enabling lock on motors should be enough to keep it in place
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:30:35 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:31:13 then it'll look too bulky when you make it out of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:33:52 wait wtf
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:34:02 OHHH
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:34:19 so that's why i couldn't move in-game
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:36:10 it locks the motors, and they won't move unless you press one of the buttons
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:36:35 sometimes the lock kinda 'breaks' on larger builds so don't rely on it too much
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:37:42 squarebus
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:37:52 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:38:23 lool
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:38:38 it's a squarebus a90
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:39:01 so southwest makes their own planes?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:41:19 
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:41:39 ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:43:11 nose for what? <@!216371990959882241>

plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:43:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:43:55 I don't start with the nose because then i just get frustrated and quit
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:45:41 discord's image filter is almost as bad as roblox's chat filter
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:54:41 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 20:56:22 yeah it looks fine <@!340543153922768906>
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:04:15 kill it
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:05:24 that folding tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:05:50 he uses like 700 pistons to lock it in place
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:06:05 the plane isn't actually attached to any of it's parts
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:06:54 depends on what
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:07:02 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:07:37 another funny car smh

creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:03:33 oof
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:04 yeah folding the wings is annoying because they're top mounted
creations-chat 2019-02-05 21:04:22 so you have to fold it at least twice
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:05:51 can't you just revoke it manually?
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:08:19 revoke it manually br0

plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:25:40 you gotta do it when you built a plane with swept wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:14 if you make custom control surfaces on swept wings it'll look even worse than spamming normal control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-02-05 21:26:49 it was jekri i think

plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:08:45 i think he has an f6f or something now
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:09:15 because
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:10:32 
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:18:13 retard detected
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:24:02 
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:24:05 this man is sad
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:25:08 proof that anti copy works
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:26:08 
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:29:15 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:31:21 what game
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:31:28 what game
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:32:05 100 players
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:32:06 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:32:23 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:32:53 it 'shoots' snow particles
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:32:59 not actual snow
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:33:14 do you have on/off mode turned on?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:33:39 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:33:49 it doesn't work with it on for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:34:38 the only use for it that i can think of is a 4 barrel carburetor
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:34:59 because it sucks as a thruster
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:35:25 because snow doesn't make your plane catch fire
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:35:51 it's not smoke though
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:36:02 and smoke shouldn't make a difference either
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:36:04 yeah ikr
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:36:08 fog is gay
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:36:37 did you disable the snow?
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:36:46 go to the cave
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:37:12 and there's a red button wit a safety glass on the control panel
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:37:21 just press it and it should disappear
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:37:35 but you gotta do it for every new server you join which is retarded imo
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:37:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:38:45 to the left
plane-crazy 2019-02-06 23:39:05 the one with the safety glass cover on it

plane-crazy 2019-02-07 21:26:10 i don't get why we need to disable it every server we join
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 21:31:07 disabled snow and i'm still getting 3 fps
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 21:31:40 you press the red button in the cave
plane-crazy 2019-02-07 21:32:17 but you gotta do it every time you join another server because rick is one smart boi

plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:52:43 and if he is
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:53:03 there is no way in FUCKING HELL that he's fitting the wings+engines in that plot
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:53:35 the wingspan is gonna be like 3 plots
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:53:40 probably more
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:54:05 
plane-crazy 2019-02-12 13:54:33 right

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:00:35 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:00:45 it works very well tbh
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:15:30 someone tried going on my bridge with his tiger and it's wheelbase is just barely enough to not fall off lmao
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:55:22 have you been playing with it a lot on public servers?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:55:27 before he copied you, imean
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:55:30 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:56:24 that's why you anti-copy blacklist everyone when you play with small, easily copyable builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 14:56:29 on publics
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:00:22 I remember thelastgamers (or whatever his name was) had his hind copied
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:00:38 and he DMd rick about it and he has yet to do anything
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:02:12 I don't think that rick can even ban people from the game
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:02:24 yeah?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:02:49 I thought he said that to do that he needed the game to be in a group or something
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:02:54 or was that for ingame mods
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:03 who's he
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:06 the copier?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:14 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:16 k
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:35 I'm surprised that he hasn't left yet
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:04:43 lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:05:07 alright
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:06:05 commit make ingame mods
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:07:29 I only got 'maybe' copied once
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:07:58 underpowered copied my bf110 but it's ugly and shit anyway so i didn't really care
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:08:53 yesterday i saw someone building imperial's old 747
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:08:58 same paintjob as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 15:09:44 the problem is, i'm assuming, that he only got a screenshot of the front

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 17:26:45 shouldn't you change the channel description then?
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 17:50:32 i've never cringed that hard in this game
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:05:28 this car has been in this server for hours, and someone actually fucking copied it
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:05:31 
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:05:55 this has probably happened to someone with a build that he put effort into
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:06:45 the playerbase of roblox isn't exactly known for it's originality and imagination
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:07:09 quite ironic because that's what their motto states
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:07:39 I'll have to disagree
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:07:53 but i understand why some people don't like replicas and prefer originals
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:08:15 there
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 18:08:30 not entirely

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:43:04 the vip servers are either empty or filled to the brim with 3k+ block creations
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 22:43:47 flexing is fun on 🅱roke ass noobs

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:05:30 im sure that exists
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:05:45 i was talking about the sr-10
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:05:56 that's complicated as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:06:16 also you can't build the microfighters inside the 747 because they're angled
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:07:02 what if what
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:07:25 wouldn't work
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:07:43 the mothership would just break
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:07:58 because the game doesn't like it when someone is transporting soemone else's craft
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:08:10 ok bro
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:08:19 wh-

plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:09:22 yeah tu-114
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:09:26 that's pretty small
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:09:32 no
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:09:48 turboprop whistle aaaaa
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:10:15 cardboard box with wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:10:30 vampire is good too
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:12:04 it's been suggested so many times
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:12:12 and rejected so many times
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:12:15 don't even bother
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:12:51 i'd only use radios to either play eurobeat or mc mental
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:13:30 making the decal system would be a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2019-02-13 23:13:43 like applying it to uneven surfaces

creations-chat 2019-02-13 23:47:45 fuck shit
creations-chat 2019-02-13 23:51:30 M60 AVLB (Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge)
Based off of the M60 Patton, this tank has a portable folding bridge mounted on top of it.
The bridge is used to bring other tanks/vehicles across very rough terrain or deep holes.

-The tank has a top speed of 100 SPS with the bridge on top of it and about 150 without it.
-Deploying the bridge is very easy and takes around 30 seconds (motors were slowed down on purpose)
-After getting to the other end of the bridge, the tank is able to pick the bridge up and continue on it's way.
 
No suspension as of now, I'm going to add it soon though.

creations-chat 2019-02-13 23:56:45 thanks
creations-chat 2019-02-13 23:57:25 nice use of the snow blaster
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:02:19 you're not making that in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:02:22 just, no
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:02:45 docking is damn near impossible, (if you even have enough space for the microfighters)
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:02:46 AND
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:03:08 having other people build their own microfighters isn't gonna work
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:03:41 because roblox's physics has a big gay when you transport someone else's build
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 14:03:58 so the microfighters have to be built by you, on the same account
general 2019-02-14 14:05:07

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:02:07 nice
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:02:17 1/2 of my suspension ruined then
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:04:21 a lot of people have been complaining about it so i assume that yes

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:13:52 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:04 in your case, i'd be more concerned about making it float
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:14:33 really?

plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:15:59 it cannot turn at that speed though
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:16:07 if i try to turn it just flips over
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:16:30 nah i don't really want to
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:16:39 it corners fine at 120-150
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:17:12 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-14 21:18:01 my DC-10 does like 500 l0l

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:40:44 lemme see
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:43:55 <@!251941191463993345> no idea
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:11 I'm not really good with drones tbh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:46:00 imperial only builds airliners
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:46:04 and uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:46:08 that's it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:35 it'll slow you down too
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:30:55 Just make a twin engine lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:31:09 no torque drifting at all
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:31:37 what
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:31:54 the plane in the pic had a single pr0p
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:32:04 aight
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:33:27 I do too
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:33:33 And i can probably make some sort of trim since i use motorized controls
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:33:44 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:34:00 they do but you gotta angle them
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:34:15 variable pitch basically
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:34:47 i have it on the saab
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:35:01 but it's not my main source of thrust
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:35:35 also variable pitch doesn't work with more than one 50 speed motor
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:35:42 it just glitches out
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:36:28 make a twin engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:36:31 haha
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:36:40 yes he did
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:36:58 for trolling or something
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:38:22 I should have propeller master since my plane (the one that won the contest) used only motorized props as well
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:38:23 but never cared enough to ask for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:38:55 it does, just shit
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:40:22 can you don't
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:43:02 I love how none of the mods are on at times like these

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:58:05 only if you want it to fly straight
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:58:27 you don't have to use contra rotating props
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:58:43 but it'll veer off to the side the prop is spinning
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:58:55 OR
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:02 you can make a twin engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:52 I never said that this exact plane had to be a twin engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 12:59:58 Also
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 13:00:12 Biplanes didn't have counter props lmao

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:09:41 There's a reason why trijets aren't being produced anymore
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:10:15 Jets with just 2 engines are just better
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:10:32 Easier to maintain, more economical, etc
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:10:58 So could uhhh every other double engined jet

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:34:12 ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:35:45 I guess it's alright
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 16:36:10 I would paint it white but white looks bad for some reason

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 21:25:26 yes

plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:12:00 done with the trainer, for now at least
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:15:22 dumbass built this (ugly) unit of a plane and yet he still just stuck the ingame jet engines on the wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:16:00 also the way he folds is just bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:16:41 engines or folding?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:21:43 yeah he's done with the wings since it has the little fin at the end
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:22:16 also he's got scaffolding all over so he proably doesn't know how to ragdol glitch
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:23:34 gonna wait for him to unfold one second
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:24:06 who

creations-chat 2019-02-24 11:33:41 also fire mode selector
creations-chat 2019-02-24 11:59:14 Alright, nice job though
the-dump 2019-02-24 14:15:10 vb longneck
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:15:57 that's a bad control surfaces placement
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:16:15 most of them are really close to the center so they have little to no effect
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:16:40 what nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:16:47 it's a fact
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:17:08 the way he placed his control surfaces is not effective
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:21:24 it's a nexus admin command bar
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:44:36 Seems like EasyJet's budget is running out
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:46:53 a while ago i was in a sever with someone who roleplayed about this
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:47:49 i kamikaze'd his ship and then he said

plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:56:19 probably a 747
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:56:27 pretty bad one though
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 14:56:50 a good WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:00:17 no it's a jumbo jet

plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:45:16 
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:45:31 yes but it's related
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:45:54 orange said that if it's related to the topic then it's allowed
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:47:13 what
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:47:49 following that logic, i can post a picture of a cat, and it's allowed since cats can breathe, so can humans, and humans play roblox and plane crazy is a game in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:49:26 it's noot level 100 because it's short as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:49:30 and made of glass
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:49:59 the inner workings are more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 15:50:01 not the looks

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:09:54 he's building nothing
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:10:20 Boeing 2707
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:29:06 i don't get his 747
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:29:16 the top is just flat
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:29:17 like why
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:29:29 yes hhahaa

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:31:50 didn't imperial's 747 also have a flat top
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:32:12 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/532394329377996800/Screen_Shot_2019-01-08_at_9.04.34_PM.png think it did
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:32:54 perhaps
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:34:21 tryna make the wings for this
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:34:23 and i honestly want to die
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:35:20 guess
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:36:00 ye

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:37:00 making it droop means making it look like a piece of shit

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:38:09 
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:38:44 it's folded like this because i wanted to have the rear part lined up
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:38:50 so it's easier to make the wings
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:39:07 that big n00b voxel folded his 144 like any other plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 14:39:15 so his wings are a glitchy folding mess

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 11:52:44 that's because it's only tracks

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:48:32 no please
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:48:56 that's also true
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:17 300 for what
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:20 how much bigger is it
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:28 fucking
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:49:51 folding is pretty easy though
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:50:59 the only tutorials they watch are the 'copy me' ones
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:51:21 people should make more technical tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:51:25 about mechanisms and such
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:51:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:51:47 is good
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:52:18 basically 5$ because you can't be bothered to learn the easiest trick in the game
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:52:52 omg
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:00 what if you just
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:02 don't add that
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:04 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:53:56 if we get bigger plots i might actually care enough to finish my 2707
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:54:56 or just prove that you have positive iq to get the plot expansion
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:55:40 bigger plots are cool but fully working motors, landing gear and pistons are even cooler imo
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:02 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:09 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:11 that's epic
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:53 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:56:59 oh shitte
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:10 lmao true
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:57:42 that's too advanced for 10 year olds
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:58:04 1 in a million
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:59:03 99% of the roblox playerbase doesn't even know what scripting is
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:59:28 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 19:59:56 what're wedges lmAO
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:00:17 omg yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:00:19 relatable

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:03:10 fact
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:03:29 or just a rotation limiter for motors
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:19:18 that sucks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:20:20 testing what
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:20:28 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:22:57 we don't have vending machines in my school

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:25:15 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:27:22 epic
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:27:56 n word pass r e v o k e d
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:28:59 it looks like angry eyes

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:29:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:30:55 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:31:11 every time we play kahoot someone fucks the game with bots
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:31:20 like EVERY time
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:33:07 smol boye

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:36:03 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 20:36:20 physics
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:19:18 does anyone here have a recoil simulation mechanism that doesn't use springs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:19:52 hm
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:20:08 nah im talking about the barrel itself
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 21:21:20 sora you have a recoil system in your maus right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:07:20 WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:07:40 aww fuckin nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:08:00 lost like 30 minutes of progress right there
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:11:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 22:19:37 relatable
general 2019-03-07 23:35:46 easier than using wedges on minecraft helicopters that's for sure
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:50:47 im pretty sure it's a t-34
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:51:21 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:51:48 kv-1 and kv-2 both have the same hull
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:52:24 yeah but
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:52:36 look at the frontal armor of this
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:52:44 it's much more angled compared to honor's
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 00:35:08 no
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 00:35:24 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 00:46:49 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 00:47:00 it looks too shit to be a tutorial
the-dump 2019-03-08 00:51:50 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 00:54:37 one example of someone who's definitely not perfect is vip

plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:43:02 yes\
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:43:18 convertible top for a lamborghini
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:43:42 it's been made like 8005670545608 times
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:43:49 not unique or new
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:44:19 almost everything that's car related was already made by aheadcop or whatever his name was don't care
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:44:38 hm
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:45:58 i've seen some computers before
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:46:06 been done before <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:46:42 double wishbones are almost as common as folding now
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:47:06 i don't know actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:47:16 i've tried pushrods but i suck so uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:47:33 if someone can somehow make leaf springs that'd be cool
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:48:33 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:49:00 if only motors worked as intended
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:49:32 lock sucks fat ass
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:49:38 and motors sometimes glitch out
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:49:56 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/548201408382631937/2019-02-21_19-53-59.mp4
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:49:58 also this
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:54:29 "i built a block"
>70 something upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:54:51 inventor
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 12:56:15 my arl-44 can do 600 while reversing
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:00:35 i think you can crudely make a leaf spring using a lot of motors and springs
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:00:48 but it's gonna be very big, bulky and impractical
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:01:10 ight
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:01:20 gl i guess
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:02:25 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:02:50 there are  upper mounted and lower mounted leaf springs
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:02:58 i think the upper mounted one is easier
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:16:31 i feel like half motors will be really useful but i can't think of any use for them atm
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:17:05 uhhh not really
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:19:56 respect women day
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:23:11 nice
general 2019-03-08 13:45:45 does anyone here know what that flag means? or something
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:48 imperial you have a recoil system thingy on your ha-go right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:50:59 using springs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:51:45 does it take the spring a couple of seconds to retract back to it's original position?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:52:44 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:53:05 that cooldown is so annoying
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:53:11 oh rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:53:36 i think i'll just improvise with suspension and rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:53:47 one sec
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 13:54:59 something like this
general 2019-03-08 13:55:48 do you know which unit?
general 2019-03-08 13:57:47 alright, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:06:52 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:04 what are these wheels
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:11 and what is that turning system
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:16 no they're not lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:29 yeah alright
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:40 usually wheels are r o u n d
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:07:44 and im not salty?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:09:48 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:15:03 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:16:18 i don't really know how well variable pitch works with the way motor lock is set up
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:17:52 Idk, i've never played with the restitution of ropes
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:36:20 godder
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:40:39 tracké
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:41:05 research field repair xddDDDd
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:41:36 nah
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:41:40 Churchill I
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:41:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:42:30 there is
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:42:54 any bigger and it would've looked really ugly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:43:22 wait lemme try something
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:44:54 still meh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:46:10 ik
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:46:39 even worse
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:46:40 you can't make that with
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:46:51 a cylinder
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:46:54 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:47:04 it barely sticks out
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:47:54 lolk
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:48:35 i'm probably just going to keep it flat
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 14:51:00 r/ihavereddit
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:33:08 nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:35:32 
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:36:09 i mean you don't, people with modeler, contest winner and inventor do have one
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:36:26 but only robo and i play on it xddd
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:36:30 it's lonely as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:39:03 lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 15:46:34 imagine dying
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:43:56 <@!298129144422858752> i found the chiron's uglier brother
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:54:22 that's true i guess, but i wouldn't call it ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:54:49 this is just above toxeed jet levels of ugly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 17:55:26 lol
general 2019-03-08 18:03:54 https://www.latlmes.com/breaking/this-is-not-funny-anymore-stop-1
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:54:56 BAD
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:55:04 what if we make an alt?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:55:22 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:56:33 why
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:56:39 wdym too easy lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:56:53 too easy to have fun for as much time as i want?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:57:31 i don't think the addition of fuel will bring the playercount back up
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:57:34 just saying
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:58:53 i don't get why people want fuel
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:58:59 what purpose does it serve
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:59:25 how about
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 18:59:35 you just make a poll in <#490306593242611742>?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:01:04 rightfully so
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:01:26 how?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:02:50 because no one wants it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:03:21 why add something that probably 80% of all players don't want, and even force them to use it
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:03:24 it's just dumb
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:04:02 pvp in general?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:04:23 but you're not forced to enter pvp
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:04:34 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:05:54 should probably be the opposite tbh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:06:58 so basically
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:07:18 have pointless blocks that take more of your save data and lag more, just so that you can stay in the air for longer?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:07:52 regardless if they're on the creation or not, it's bullshit
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:11:48 this speaks for itself tbh
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:12:15 so?
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:12:32 if it's toggleable, that's fine
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:13:13 but please don't make it so that super rockets are an exception
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:14:22 too bad i don't have any on the test server
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:14:25 oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 19:19:48 ?

plane-crazy 2019-03-09 08:31:30 i think

plane-crazy 2019-03-09 11:46:57 it probably takes like 10 minutes max

general 2019-03-10 19:16:25 4 fins are cool i guess

creations-chat 2019-03-15 11:03:58 he's not wrong though

plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:00:46 also
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:01:02 following that logic, this contest is a repeat of the last one since the creation must fly
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:01:33 also too specific imo
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:03:06 if it's carriers, might as well make integex the winner, instantly

plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:06:15 last time we had a generally land-based builds contest was uhh like 2-3 months ago?
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 15:06:48 integex is gonna win if it's about carriers, and the rocket contest was a thing not that long ago

plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:13:08 AWW
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:13:16 when you were flying the DC-10
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:13:29 you had the thrill of 'what's gonna happen next???'
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 00:39:42 got a better picture lol noob

creations-chat 2019-03-18 07:48:33 and also I'm not your dad
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 14:39:33 
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 15:32:51 no elevators
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 15:41:08 it's called criticism
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 15:41:19 no one here was saying that it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:16:25 i already have an anti-afk macro thing on my keyboard so lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:16:59 WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:17:04 24 hours?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:17:12 that's actually bullshit imo
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:17:40 24 hours just to actually play like i used to
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:18:07 ik
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:18:11 not gonna lie, if it's 24 hours, that's actually gonna encourage afk farming
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:18:28 keyboard macros exist
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:19:02 there are many anti-afk algorithms that you can easily make/download
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:19:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:19:45 if you spam A and D you won't get kicked
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:20:33 i actually wonder how many players (or so called "veterans") agree with this
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:21:02 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:21:25 also
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:21:38 what about flying under the effect of physics lag?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:22:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:22:24 and it probably consumes the same amount of fuel
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:22:31 making it even more bullshit
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:22:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:22:53 joey why don't you have the 152mm?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:23:25 for the 152?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:23:54 ik
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:24:02 but the 152mm is basically it's signature gun
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:24:28 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:35:35 so basically **almost** no one would fly untill they get the infinite fuel thingy
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:35:57 because NO ONE is going to stuff their plane with fuel blocks, since it ruins the COG and balancing
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:36:26 that's why no one is gonna fly until they unlock it
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:36:47 so we have it unlocked already?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:36:54 oh
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:36:55 good
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:38:35 if aerial refueling will be made possible that'd be so epic
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:38:55 that's quite contradictory
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:39:01 oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:39:02 nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:39:22 
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 18:39:34 also rick you should probably say it in <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:00:58 flame we get infinite fuel anyway lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:01:08 yeah true
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:01:31 Might convert my DC-10 into a KC-10
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:01:42 If aerial refueling is made possible
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:02:13 ye
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:02:26 Kc-135 has BIG engines
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:03:01 oh shit really?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:03:13 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:46:10 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:46:21 AC-130s were the heavily armed planes
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:46:55 KC-10 be like
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:47:13 also i think vip is making a C-130
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:47:16 sometime
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:47:34 same
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:47:48 he said that he'd build it like a week ago
the-dump 2019-03-18 19:48:14 i love this series of comics but ***IFUNNY***
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:48:52 what thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:48:59 uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:49:02 idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:51:18 so the only thing i need to do to my DC-10 is to paint it grey and add a refueling probe
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:51:51 i'm not gonna do it if aerial refueling won't be possible though
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:51:57 because it makes it look kinda bland
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:53:12 was the A400 capable of aerial refueling?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:53:22 lemme check
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:53:43 oh epic
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:53:54 so i can refuel with v0x
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:55:44 you have a pr0be already?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:56:00 flame
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:56:04 do you have it
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:56:17 refueling probe
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:56:22 thing
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 19:56:28 oh nice

plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:28:35 o
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:29:07 so there's a problem wit the engine?
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:29:54 accessing the fuel tank should be pretty easy on trainers though
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:31:15 i started flying a gasoline trainer like two months ago
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:31:26 with?
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:31:40 uh ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:34:18 well you gotta start somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:34:55 drew over my name e
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:35:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:35:09 it's really basic but i like it
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:35:18 dowels
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:35:26 and plastic screws
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:36:14 my dad bought the fuselage and wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:36:23 engine, servos and all other stuff was made by him
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:36:29 well, installed
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:37:04 same as mine
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:38:11 i *think* that my battery is lithium ion
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:38:21 not sure about all other parts though
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:39:23 rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:42:44 lmao robocraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:42:53 ever since they removed tiers i just quit
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:44:05 jesus
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:45:06 JUMBO JET BLOCK
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:45:18 ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:46:08 boeing 747 block
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:46:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:47:41 add decal and sound block!!!!111
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:47:57 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 15:48:06 but apparently it'd be 'abused'
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:12:24 a tug?
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:15:38 got some mad camber going on for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:16:39 wasn't on purpose
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:16:42 and
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:17:02 i'm pretty sure that it helps with drift cars and offroaders
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:18:11 pretty sure that it helps with rough landings and turns
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:18:47 but when people have like 30 degrees of camber it usually is just for aesthetics
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:20:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:23:07 almost done with the outside
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:23:28 now i need to somehow make this thing take off vertically and hover
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:23:47 because i want to
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:23:50 lol noob

plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:24:19 had like 130hp v6 l0l
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:24:40 e
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:24:55 i think yeah

plane-crazy 2019-03-24 16:25:58 some people swapped that weak ass v6 for the engine from the C6 corvette

plane-crazy 2019-03-24 21:35:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 21:37:25 
plane-crazy 2019-03-24 21:37:37 when you actually look at it 10k doesn't seem like much

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 08:28:48 <#544022464133595166> just submit your builds to <#504436696021204992> and ask for the roles you want
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 08:31:33 <@!163143541160148992> sorry for the retarded question but how do you rotate blocks like that?
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:23:28 ship contest nice
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:23:33 gg integex
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:25:57 at least there would be competition with ww2 fighters
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:26:12 we already know that integex is gonna win, boring
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:26:22 e
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:27:20 if you have a ship for the contest, you may want to submit it as early as you can lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:28:20 yeah but if you submit it later you basically have no chance against integex's kaga/that other japanese battleship
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 16:28:50 same with my curiosity rover h

plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:57:23 or friction
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:57:48 racing sliks, which are wheels with no grooves, have the most friction
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:58:20 yes they do
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:58:28 no?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:58:35 why do you think race cars use slikcs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 14:59:53 that's because slicks provide the most grip
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 15:00:43 "By eliminating any grooves cut into the tread, such tyres provide the largest possible contact patch to the road, and maximize traction for any given tyre dimension."
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 15:01:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 15:01:51 but you didn't mention weather conditions

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:14:12 ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:14:35 it looks a little too wide though
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:17:20 you need to make the wheels closer together, but i don't think it's possible to do that and still have them move freely and not weld to each other, so rip
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:18:09 actually there is a way but practical would be the last word i'd use to describe it
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:18:12 o
bug-reports 2019-04-11 06:31:52 you can place most blocks outside of the build zone but once you reload it it'll be gone
bug-reports 2019-04-11 06:50:14 the plane lags after i disconnect the 190 from it, after that it just starts spinning out of control
bug-reports 2019-04-11 06:50:19 happens basically every time

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:19:39 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:33:39 place a block below the place you want to put the wedge at
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:33:44 and place the wedge on that block
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:33:47 then delete it
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:35:11 it works but you don't have enough space
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:35:22 yeah ofc
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:35:31 you're building on the blue line
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:36:01 you're not supposed to do that, the game won't let you directly place blocks on the blue line
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:36:16 and if you have problems with space, just fold a part of your creation
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:37:33 fold some more of it xdd

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:44:36 my upscaled churchill makes some people crash when they go near it
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:44:38 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:45:35 you don't even need to watch videos or something
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:45:58 if you know anything about the E-3 or B-52 you'd know how to differentiate between them
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:46:11 mainly because one of them has a giant dinnerplate radar on top of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 11:46:27 yes

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:28:28 i love the headline in the news "the lander didn't land"
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:28:36 oh really?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:28:56 good to know man

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:29:30 they lost contact
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:29:38 two very different things
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:29:49 i doubt it did
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:30:19 if there's no communication it probably crashed in one way or another
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:30:41 well it had one preset path so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 19:31:17 that's quite vague tbh

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:33:20 the mazda costs 249,000 nis
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:33:29 which is almost $70k

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:41:05 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:41:43 what a loser
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:50:01 haven't watched it
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 13:52:25 i sometimes do, not frequently though
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:11:52 under the only thing you're good at is making the worst landing gear humanly possible
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:22:38 yes because everyone here knows what these numbers mean
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:22:53 o
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:23:46 what about this jip guy
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:24:06 oh wait he was demoted
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:24:08 xdd
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:24:50 he just said
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:24:56 right after getting mod
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:25:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:26:19 you don't need a whole car for that
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:26:26 you need a piece of road called a speedbump
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:26:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:26:50 it was probably stock
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:27:03 did it have rocket fuel?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:27:21 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:27:27 most riced cars don't look fast
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:28:08 so many kids buy the double stack wing instead of upgrades
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:14 probably because no one plays pubg on mobile anymore
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:18 rightfully so
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:36 why would they need bots then?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:45 uh huh
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:48 which means
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:29:51 lack of players
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:30:01 they don't do that on pc, why mobile?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:30:26 meh
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:00 the bot's' main purpose is to fill empty servers though
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:10 what no
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:31:33 so why does it take you 20 min to find a match?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:32:01 ok so let me correct myself
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:32:13 no one plays this game enough to reach high tiers
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:32:22 hence why the servers fill slow as shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:32:43 fpp on mobile lol

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 18:42:04 depends on the variant

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:44:17 you can send lots of messages in a shot amount of time, and not get lots of xp
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:44:25 that's because you only get xp once per minute
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:45:01 you can say "e" every minute and probably have more xp/messages than imperial
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:45:21 why chrome

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:48:10 you don't have to be active as shit on every server you're in
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 15:49:36 ok

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:44:58 why
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:45:03 shouldn't be that difficult
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:45:34 you don't HAVE to have those side vents present
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:45:46 just focus on the main grille
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:46:29 you said that you've deleted it
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:46:33 ok

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:48:07 he was gamer right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:48:14 something gamer 404
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:50:10 why are the front tires so fucking wide + don't spin
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:50:47 fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:50:55 but make them normal width for god's sake
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:51:06 either just one cylinder or half
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:51:44 dragsters have phat rear tires and smol bike wheels at the front
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:51:48 not the other way around
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:51:57 better, but make the rear tires wider
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:53:15 move the motors inside
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:55:48 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:56:11 so skinny ass rear wheels it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:59:33 1060Ti
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 17:59:43 that doesn't exist noob

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:01:11 also integex can you finish the wheels
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:01:32 lol noob
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:02:08 you can use 1x2 wedges all the way around
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:02:24 and i think i have another version of a 3x3 wheel
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:03:17 having the wheels like that is even gayer
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:05:42 henk
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:05:54 boasting about your drifting skills in VS
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:06:03 is like boasting about finding a cent on the street
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:06:39 not only that, everyone and their mom could do it
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:06:54 it's harder to drift on NFS 2012 than it is on VS
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:07:59 looks like a car you'd find in carmageddon
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:08:26 but it already has a cool looking dragster
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:09:22 
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:09:23 barely any pics of it online for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:12:24 isn't a truck unless you have leaves on the back
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:13:27 it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:13:46 make the wheels their actual width
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:13:51 like 3-4 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:13:55 and then say it's skinny
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:14:05 jew ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:14:32 uh what's constructive criticism amirite
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:15:42 under you probably saw trucks only after they came out of the crusher
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:16:04 real truck
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:16:05 big wide
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:16:38 ranger raptor lol no
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:10 that makes more sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:19 but
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:28 if you were going for that better change the cab
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:30 kat
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:40 the wheels are placeholders
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:45 to trasnport it in a truck
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:17:54 cause the real wheels are too wide for a trailer
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:18:27 american standards do suggest that this truck is infact skinny
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:20:23 do the wheels even turn <@!429665143677255681>
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:20:37 also did you use a magnet drive?
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:21:09 magnet drives do function but very poorly
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:22:31 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:23:10 my trailblazer used to have like 6 magnet drives (3 magnets each) but i replaced them with rockets
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:23:22 because it was so fucking unstable after the update
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:24:45 you can't have the wheels turn, not look gay AND function at the time time
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:24:51 with that open wheel design
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:26:17 how are you going to fit the left booster
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:26:46 it's the right in the pic ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:26:53 oh yes

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:48:57 i mean that specific uhhh skit
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:49:06 it was kinda boring
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:49:24 I liked the 2nd episode of the first season
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:49:30 where they drove the S8+
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:49:46 ye
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:50:10 doubt it
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:50:29 james did shoot that limo probably with real bullets
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:50:44 but they didn't use real ones when they were attacking
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:52:20 the one with the i3 and Golf GTi was also a good one
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:52:23 well, partly

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:56:06 that was also a good one
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:56:17 imo the S8 one was the best
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:56:27 operation desert something
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:56:47 desert stumble
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:56:48 e

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:57:30 also the gymkhana parody thing with the STI was quite good
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:58:21 ys
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:58:28 bond bug speed record
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 18:58:31 also good
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:00:13 i like the episodes where they build shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:00:21 or heavily modify their cars
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:00:34 dual axle mx-5
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:00:53 it's quite old i think
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:01:24 
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:01:28 the one in iraq
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:01:59 https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/show/01_03_34mb_1.jpg

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:02:44 an audi

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:04:04 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:04:17 oh and how can we forget the excellent
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:04:50 
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:05:06 the merc one was actually mounted properly
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:05:48 it was pretty good yeah

plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:06:15 G63 6x6, the marauder and now this
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:06:37 true
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:07:04 but in the same episode with the ripsaw he was given a 1000HP buggy
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:07:11 and that's pretty easy to die in
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:07:53 at least clackson wouldn't let him drive john
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:08:49 oh yeah the luggage cars was really fucking good
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:09:25 and i mean this
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:11:22 "Major may to major hammond, I have you in my Mercedes Benz-bonnet mounted gunsight"
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:11:35 one of the best quotes from tg
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:12:46 https://youtu.be/I0K8AXUEH8E?t=244 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 19:13:42 it's top gear not grand tour

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 12:54:35 gam's carrier spawned that way
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 12:54:44 and it'd take ages for him to turn it around

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:05:55 fuck flamethrowers
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:05:57 give us sails
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:11:15 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:11:35 yeah that's not happening
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:11:53 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:11:57 did rickman confirm it
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:12:04 where
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:12:31 he confirmed so much stuff in suggestions but it wasn't added yet
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:12:47 so if it does happen, it'll probably be in the 22nd century
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:09 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:26 but it wouldn't work imo
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:38 because you can't have cogs overlap in build mode
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:43 you have to push it in manually
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:13:48 and that's FUCKING gay
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:21 if that was possible, stackable half blocks would be a thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:28 but it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:14:53 changing the building grid thing will require a rewrite probably maybe
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:09 yeah so what
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:20 the building grid prevents you from having overlapping blocks
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:57 plane crazy but it's actually what we want edition
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:15:59 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:17:12 mazda mx-5 BBR turbo

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:21:18 it'll probably glitch like a motherfucker on large creations/when lifting heavy objects
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:25:32 it jiggles when it's extended
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:25:37 not a very good sign

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:53:01 after getting "hit" by a flamethrower
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:55:19 a guy repeatedly called me a kid because i said "rocket spammer inbound"
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:55:40 and guess what he was using in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:55:54 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:56:04 that requires positive IQ
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 17:56:28 nice resolution
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 18:43:36 looks much better now imo
the-dump 2019-04-17 19:01:32 you can have a 1x1 pixel video but render it as 1080P
the-dump 2019-04-17 19:02:49 ofc it isn't but it was rendered as HD
the-dump 2019-04-17 19:19:45 ok
creations-chat 2019-04-17 19:23:12 first of all, there's no way in hell that it's a '75, it's the '68
and second, did you just give up when you got to the taillights?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:26:50 why so many
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:27:44 ok but 62??
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:11 and you play each one enough to justify keeping it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:28:26 how much storage does it take up
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:29:37 yeah i remember that
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 19:31:13 a server which i used to moderate constantly gets shitty mod app responses

plane-crazy 2019-04-17 20:58:30 upscaled or 1:1
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 20:59:11 if you want to add as much detail as possible, fold it
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 20:59:28 but note that it's very retarded and annoying to work on it like that
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:00:00 also if you fold it like i do, don't go over 25 blocks of width
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:00:13 yes dumb
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:01:00 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544722974574379021/567911285518237706/unknown.png
when vip's noses look epic but you can't even copy it right
creations-chat 2019-04-17 21:01:58 apparently the 1975 ***R/T*** looks nothing like the normal '75 charger
creations-chat 2019-04-17 21:02:47 it's probably based off of the third gen charger though, not the fourth
creations-chat 2019-04-17 21:02:55 that's why i was confused
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:03:11 why
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:03:46 also the squares don't have that hole in the middle

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:11:47 because that's how my country works
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:12:00 im gonna drive my dad's astra station turbo
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:12:06 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:12:32 my mom has an auris hybrid
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:12:33 lol e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:12:42 i think the astra has like 150HP
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:13:31 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:14:27 yeah almost 150
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:14:27 ok bye
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:15:33 which
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:15:51 uh huh
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:16:05 i've driven a mclaren F1 GTR
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:16:41 as much bs as you driving all bmws
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:16:42 lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:16:47 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:17:15 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:17:30 yeah i get it now
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:18:46 my dad's friend used to have a skoda octavia VRS
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:19:03 and he used an aftermarket ecu to get more horsepower
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:19:25 and after like 5 months he went to get it serviced
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:19:35 and turns out that there was a crack in the fucking engine block
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:21:54 fucking
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:22:12 i've never seen someone with more than 2000 gameplay hours
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:22:18 on a single game
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:23:06 the only one who would make sense to have over 7k hours on beamng
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:23:13 is this guy
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:23:45 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:23:57 beamng is fun but how do you dedicate an entire channel towards it
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:24:26 what the fuck were you doing
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:24:51 there's only so much you can do before it becomes fucking boring
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:25:04 even the scenarios get old eventually
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:25:26 i was talking about beamng lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:25:38 but the same idea could be applied to wfyb
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:25:50 spend 20 hours
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:25:54 doing what exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:26:40 wdym vanilla everything
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:26:44 the cars?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:27:03 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:30:39 LOL I3
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:30:44 noob!!!!!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:31:36 the one im getting is like double that probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:31:47 focusing on a 1660Ti
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:34:13 under imo you should just spend like 100 more and get an i5
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:34:26 it would last much longer too
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:34:54 yeah but that's much more expensive
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:35:50 last gen's i7 costs a little over 300
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:35:59 and that's not even the K one
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:36:34 needs more stretch
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:38:29 accurate tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:38:50 mega already made a toaster tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:39:09 ctrl+f
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:39:12 toaster tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:39:19 it's not that hard
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:39:37 ugly

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:50:29 under
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:50:42 why can't you spend like a 100 more on an i5
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:51:01 oh oof
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:51:13 770 is all your budget?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:51:36 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:51:52 remove that thermal paste and it'll be 14
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:52:11 you can literally fine some anywhere
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:52:22 noob i didn't mean don't get it at all

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:55:56 bro
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:56:39 2060 is around 400
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:56:48 why is that 1070Ti so fucking expensive
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:57:21 u noob
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:58:37 now that i replaced the 1070 with the 1660Ti it dropped down to 1132$ total
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:58:41 holy  shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 00:59:39 utah

plane-crazy 2019-04-18 01:02:08 my last name has 5 grams of uranium 235
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 01:03:03 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 01:06:41 sswdadasdwasdwad
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 05:45:32 _
_
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 06:07:42 gc is ugly
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 06:15:25 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 12:56:06 that's my plot btw
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:23:44 looks kinda weird
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:25:01 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:25:41 but it looks uhh chubby i guess?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:26:00 i don't really know how to describe it
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:26:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:26:57 also it looks somewhat weird without the circles in the headlights
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:27:03 idk if you can replicate that though
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:27:14 left click <@497121057678032896>
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:27:23 but you can only fire on pvp servers
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:27:42 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:27:48 i don't think you're able to
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:28:20 try placing guns on other creations, see if they still won't fire
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:28:37 better
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:29:49 dunno if you can remake them with glass blocks because there are missing glass versions of some wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:29:55 ricknoob add more glass wedges!!111
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:30:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:31:06 and stretching the 1x4 wedge also takes 0.1 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:32:10 odd
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:32:35 if you're sure that they don't work in PVP mode, submit a bug report to <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:32:45 explain your problem, etc
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:33:28 looks much better
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:33:30 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:33:40 how does it look from the side
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:33:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:34:33 we should see the plastic version of glass blocks in buildmode, so that you can actually see each block
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:34:46 and once you spawn it'll switch to actual glass
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:01 should i add a spare wheel here?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:07 like this
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:19 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:20 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:45 octagon wheel
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:37:52 8 awesome angles
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:39:59 left
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:40:08 actually no
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:40:09 right
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:40:40 the only left
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:41:02 it's the right one if you're talking about the driver's prespective
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:41:29 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:41:35 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:41:53 i did say right
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:41:55 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:42:05 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:42:17 wHy NOt bOth
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:42:21 uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:42:40 i'd paint say white but white looks kinda gay in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:43:05 either black or red
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:43:10 maybe dark blue
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:44:09 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:44:11 no wing though
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:44:27 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:44:49 yeah way too dark
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:45:06 the supra and R34 without the wing look so weird
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:45:25 it's like 40% of the car's presence
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:46:08 that's better
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:46:31 i made the best meme in pc
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:46:33 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:47:20 try red
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:47:47 silver/grey is also an option but it's pretty bland imo
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:48:23 midnight purple
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 14:48:32 yes
creations-chat 2019-04-18 15:04:16 bruh the armor near the gun isn't angled
creations-chat 2019-04-18 15:04:22 it's flat
creations-chat 2019-04-18 15:05:26 ok so i've just checked and there is a little bit of an angle, not that much though
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:06:12 <@497121057678032896> you can toggle night/day in the game's settings
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:22:14 you don't
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:37:56 just send the link to your profile
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:37:59 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:39:24 just send a link to your roblox profile
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:39:27 like this  https://www.roblox.com/users/925370810/profile
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:40:50 regardless if it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 15:46:30 wtf is a .jfif
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:49:11 
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:49:15 <@!255361087262818304>
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:49:56 yeah i make it seem complicated but it isn't really
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:53:04 mine's 21
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:58:44 the A-pillar?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:59:11 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 16:59:55 either use a motor to get the correct angle or live with it
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:00:05 the first option is a pain in the ass btw
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:00:52 also if your supra is 23 blocks wide i think you're better off folding it 180 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:01:11 that's also 23 wide
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:01:18 and that mid section is worthless
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:03:09 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:04:35 unless you find a way to somewhat lock it in place (not using motor lock) then no
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:08:56 use it then
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:09:12 but motor lock will give you trouble, probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:09:37 idk
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:09:57 have something in the roof that limits the angle of it
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:10:32 you're making the windshield?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:11:00 that's what i do
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 17:11:35 it's annoying to work with glass, especially because there aren't enough glass wedges
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 18:47:59 no
the-dump 2019-04-18 18:57:23 dms?

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 18:51:54 I don't remember the p90 in tt
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:22:39 baris what're your specs
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:23:37 are you playing with gpu or onboard graphics?
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:24:24 If it's "dead" you might want to consider using the CPU's graphics
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:24:59 wdym lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:25:11 I'm using integrated graphics
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:25:31 And i get 1680x1050
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:25:43 Have you installed the right driver?
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 19:26:02 what cpu is it
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:23:16 there used to be a rank about land vehicles and it was removed
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:23:38 no
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:23:41 it was about speed
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:24:08 yeah
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:24:49 also for the engineer rank, the requirements used to be doubled for a land based vehicle
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:25:13 if you needed 100+ parts for the rank, a land vehicle would need 200+
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:26:35 you can still get ranks for land vehicles, such as designer, if i remember correctly
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:30:09 ask a mod for it, and provide proof
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:30:29 yes
creations-chat 2019-04-19 21:31:36 tag? you mean channel?

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 21:35:30 hi
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 21:37:08 if we get bigger plots, some, if not most folding creations will become obsolete

plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:32:41 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:32:58 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:33:45 not your main though
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:34:47 so rick was the one who unbanned him?
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:35:22 it is but if he's actually over 13 there shouldn't be a problem with it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:41:25 im pretty sure that most of the <13 bans were because of TOS, and not what you just said
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:41:57 how is that false
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:42:15 they did ban people because of TOS
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:42:22 i don't give a shit if they didn't have to
plane-crazy 2019-04-19 23:42:28 but you still did

plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:08:53 and discord is running just fine
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:09:42 is it because your carrier is still glitching to outer space
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:09:48 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:09:59 my GPU is under repairs
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:10:44 it's probably because it's still loose
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:10:50 did you try it with motor lock enabled?
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:11:04 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:11:27 ok enjoy having that thing fly 5 seconds after you spawn it
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:11:50 keybinds or specifically motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:12:13 oh yeah

plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:41:02 lower torque prevents motors from glitching into shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-20 07:41:22 higher torque makes them sometimes glitch into shit, which causes this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/532590912438796308/Annotation_2019-01-09_180553.png

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:15:42 bro
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:15:46 what the fuck did he run over
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:16:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:16:49 give up and play a better game
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:18:17 is it anchored?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:19:47 is lock enabled?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:20:01 it probably is
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:36:21 more like iiloser
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:36:40 true
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:37:01 flame will forever be the loserest of all losers
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:37:27 he left because yoko said that the MiG 15 looked like a sabre
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:37:45 well not LITERALLY
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:37:52 they argued and then he left
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:38:32 alright good
*leaves*
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:38:41 yes

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:41:46 it's pretty easy to differentiate between them if you actually know about planes
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:42:21 it'd make sense if someone with little to no knowledge about planes and shit called the sabre a mig
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:42:39 r/shutthefuckup
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 21:43:22 vox should blacklist "no u"

plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:43:04 deci already made a hand thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:43:13 and even that isn't inventor worthy
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:43:59 snip & sketch better
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:48:16 I used to do that on CSR classics
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:48:27 if anyone even knows what that is
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:48:49 i think it's dead now tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:49:03 it wouldn't let me download it anymore
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:49:21 and the new game is too cramped with shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:49:38 the only thing it has going for it is the graphics
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:49:45 until A9 came in lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:50:02 I actually used to no life A9 came out
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:50:10 got the vulcan in less than 2 weeks
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:50:20 but it became REALLY boring after that
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:50:31 i used to, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:50:44 you konw how they have the fuel system in the new one?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:51:03 refueling the vulcan, which is an A class car, would take 4 hours
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:51:10 yeah same
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:51:20 my uncle let me play asphalt 6 on his phone
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:51:28 when i was like 10
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:52:10 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:52:35 I have the nemesiss in asphalt 8
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:52:37 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:52:48 3 days of nonstop grind for that bitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:54:13 dunno why but that made me download a9 again
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:54:38 pro
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:54:46 what was your best car on asphalt 8
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:55:13 that's not a car
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:55:49 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:57:26 shit what
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:57:28 really?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:57:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:58:15 i had that
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:58:39 it normally costs 4 mil but it was on discount because of christmas or some shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:58:46 so i got it for 2.5mil
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:59:02 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 22:59:22 but i basically stopped playing it after buying the car
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:00:13 was the silver lightning an S class?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:00:41 i remember it costed like 300k
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:01:24 never owned it
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:01:36 my top D class was the mustang
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:01:51 it was also my only max/pro car on that game
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:02:42 alright bye
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:04:31 like a real liebherr 1500
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:16:44 <@!429665143677255681> e
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:16:55 too bad it takes like 4 hours to refuel
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:18:52 oo the sagaris is good
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:19:11 i think i had the laferarri for that tier
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:19:25 i don't remember
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:19:28 lemme go check
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:20:07 
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:20:14 really good bang for the buck
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:20:25 got me some good wins on mp
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:20:27 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:20:34 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:21:07 i think the P1 costs around 500k
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:21:16 somehow the sagaris is still better
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:21:32 but then again, im pretty sure that in the same tier was a 1971 corvette
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:22:49 bro
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:22:51 that's A class apparently
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:23:00 also 850k
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:23:45 well expect nothing less from ubigay
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:24:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:24:24 also remember B I K E S???
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:24:45 i had like two
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:24:54 they drive like shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:25:09 and the stunt/boost system is actually retarded
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:25:38 even worse, you could only get them with blueprints
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:00 with bikes or asphalt in general
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:12 o
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:23 well, it's even worse in A9
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:35 they have this fucking idiotic mechanic called "360"
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:43 where your car just does a 360 on the spot
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:26:55 and everyone within a 7 mile radius dies when you do it
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:27:17 so every multiplayer race people would just spam 360
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:27:23 no fucking clue
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:27:32 i only used it for flat spins
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:27:50 also they made drifting worthless in a9
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:28:19 and sometimes it doesn't even do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:28:41 meh
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:28:49 losers who use touchdrive always lose anyway
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:29:13 i didn't even know what it was until i reached the 3rd chapter of the career
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:29:54 eyup
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:30:04 but ya bois at ubisoft need that paycheck
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:30:54 everything is so fucking expensive now too
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:31:06 225 tokens for one centenario blueprint card thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:31:48 very no
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:33:51 3 hours
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:33:53 might as well die
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:34:34 asphalt 8 introduced a ticket system to mp i think
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:35:02 every update they rolled out for a8 was just another p2w system tbh
creations-chat 2019-04-22 23:35:59 would be nice if you actually showed the suspension
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:38:56 what's so funny
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:39:29 ha i'm 6'1
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:39:45 i'll be
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:43:27 looks like a scam
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:43:55 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:44:30 gerado
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:44:50 it'll probably ask you to fill a non existent survey
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:45:14 basically what you did is give the owner some money by sharing his scam website
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:45:29 show proof of your robux then
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:45:54 do you know how many sites like this exist on the internet
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:46:10 "sent to your account"
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:46:16 nothowitworks.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:46:42 gerado you sound like you've only been on the internet for 7 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:46:51 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:47:05 i've fallen to one of these when i was 10
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:47:19 noob
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:48:15 probably more tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:48:35 how long have you been on the internet for?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:48:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:49:27 i doubt the owner cares
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:49:37 he probably sells the info to another corporation
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:50:10 not necessarily nsfw
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:50:19 just browsing data and history in general
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:51:00 inferno did you click on it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:51:07 noob
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:51:41 gamers should be able to identify sites like these from a mile away
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:52:16 my chest was blown up by a creeper
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:53:04 actually dumb
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:56:09 i'm secretly a human, but don't tell anyone
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:56:58 im just a couple pixels on your screen
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:59:30 oh shit one of my servers has screensharing
plane-crazy 2019-04-22 23:59:55 this is the future
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 07:17:26 that's the third time he got banned i think
plane-crazy 2019-04-23 07:39:43 yes

plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:20:48 I remember back when the game launched, they asked for $30 just for a 718 cayman starter back
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:21:10 and now it's one 1.99 <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:21:47 i love this
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:21:57 LaFerarri: 1.99

plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:22:19 nope
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:22:36 
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:22:36 also it says PACK
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:22:50 so i don't think you just get blueprints
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:23:12 yeah but off from w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:23:26 because you can't just BUY it with ingame currency
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:23:42 oh wait, you can, but it's overpiced as shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:04 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:28 bad example because the cmaro is a piece of shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:30 but
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:38 every time you buy one blueprint
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:41 it doubles
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:44 the price
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:24:56 probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:25:01 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:25:14 waiting 4 hours to refuel simulator
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:06 the gameplay is really fun, one of the best mobile games ever imo
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:16 but everything that surrounds it is just garbage
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:26 i.e microtransactions
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:36 grid autosport
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:38 i think
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:26:56 can't remember if it has microtransactions or not
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:27:20 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:27:30 you're talking about gear.club
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:27:52 lmao gear.club is hot garbage though
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:28:04 so sad to see that this is how eden games came out in the end
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:28:42 test drive unlimited?
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:29:04 damn
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:29:07 great game btw
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:29:24 both TDU and V-Rally are the games that made them popular
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:29:41 but then E-*cough* atari basically killed them off

plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:51:34 vulcan*
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:52:06 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:52:40 back when this game was new i was able to get up to legend, which is the best MP rank possible, easily
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:53:10 now everyone has maxed out chirons and shit
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:53:26 HAHAA YEAH
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:53:38 if i remember correctly, i IS the best car in the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:53:50 ye but it's limited
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:53:52 so gay
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:54:14 haha
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:54:25 meh
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:54:47 if you're prepared to go over 260, you probably have 100s of tires
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:55:01 even though they're like 40k a set
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:55:14 for a piece of rubber hahahah
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:55:54 huh
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:56:04 could be
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:56:26 also yeah, it's the 'best' car in the game
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:56:39 jet fuel
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:56:43 ye
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:57:00 ik
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:57:14 260mph in the flintstones car
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:57:34 lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:58:48 the chiron wasn't really built to take such tight corners on the track imo
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:59:02 it seems more like an autobahn car thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:59:23 that's every supercar ever
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 23:59:56 hell, some manufacturers have the little switches that turn the battery off
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:00:11 they know their customers well
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:00:32 most modern supercars have it
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:01:14 can't really think of an example rn though
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:01:28 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:01:55 that's how most limited edition cars end up
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:02:30 look at cars like the 250GTO, the F1 or GT40
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:02:41 people are scared shitless of even scratching them
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:04:19 they weren't exactly locked up because they're not comfortable on the road
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:04:28 an F1 is worth like 1.5 mil
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:05:06 the last 250GTO was sold for 52 mil if i remember correctly
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:05:13 nobody's going to risk crashing it
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:05:59 NEVERMIND
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:06:01 70MIL
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:06:09 it was 52mil pounds
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:07:10 I do
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:07:11 e
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:08:20 I'm pretty sure that super expensive cars like the GT40, 250GTO and the AC Cobra have lots of replicas
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:08:28 some are even 1:1
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:08:42 so if you really want to drive one you can
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:09:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:09:10 some aren't that good though
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 00:09:31 renault twizy f1 best car

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:34:27 show pic
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:34:48 of the thing you're trying to fold
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:35:22 so just test ways to fold?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:36:02 it depends on what you're trying to fold
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:36:19 folding the fuselage of a plane, for example, is ever so slightly more complicated
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:36:22 cause it's round
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:37:41 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:37:53 i'd just start with the main bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:38:29 folding isn't that hard, and starting with the fold itself is not a really good idea imo

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:52:00 yes so what
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 17:52:16 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:14:16 how in the world did you think that it's an R34
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:15:34 yeah but an R34?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:16:00 even the integra is a better guess
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:17:37 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:18:02 
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:18:31 yeah that's what i meant
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:18:49 not a single car has that kind of taillights
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:19:00 (talking about the supra)
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:20:43 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:20:53 headlights are white though
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:21:50 you're talking about the mk II golf right
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:21:54 oh that
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:22:12 but the R35 had LED taillights
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:22:31 
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 18:23:00 meh, if you know cars well you can probably distinguish between the two pretty easily

general 2019-04-26 19:00:02 I think my best car was the aventador
general 2019-04-26 19:00:09 either that or the R8 LMS
general 2019-04-26 19:00:19 same
general 2019-04-26 19:00:45 i got frustrated with the Z4 event and went the opposite way trying to wreck the car as much as possible
general 2019-04-26 19:01:23 a9
general 2019-04-26 19:01:30 need for speed is boring tbh
general 2019-04-26 19:01:42 races are short and not very exciting
general 2019-04-26 19:05:56 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:07:24 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:12:30 bruh if it's WWI aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:12:49 I still have that upscaled SE5 somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:13:11 might finish it for the contest if WWI is picked
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:14:22 modeler for what
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:15:31 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:16:20 now that i think about it, I don't really have any good WWII aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:16:27 well nothing that'd win  the contest
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:16:56 oh damn vox

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:19:14 the only good WWII planes that i have are the 109Z or the TA154 mistle
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:19:42 ok so if it's steampunk you win
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:19:46 gotcha

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:21:02 and it might still win
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:21:41 i don't really want to take a stance in the whole server admin situation but why does rick even need to be the server owner
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:22:52 but he want's to be the owner because it "help him as a developer" maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:22:55 idk

plane-crazy 2019-04-26 19:55:41 wait
help 2019-04-26 20:01:25 something might be welded to the pillar here
help 2019-04-26 20:01:47 does it move at all or does it just move poorly?
help 2019-04-26 20:03:02 so there's not enough friction between the cylinders to the pillar
help 2019-04-26 20:03:30 you can either put some pressure on it using springs, but that'd make it pretty unreliable and glitchy at times
help 2019-04-26 20:03:46 or use helium to make it lighter
help 2019-04-26 20:04:19 I don't really know if it'll work or not, but give it a try
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 20:04:38 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 20:05:10 I kinda wanted WWI aircraft but WWII is also pretty g00d
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 20:05:23 not like i'd finish my SE5 in time anyway so lol

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:50:59 $150 for 45 blueprints
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:51:21 if you want to unlock the car just from this deal, you have to pay $200
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:53:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:53:18 it's fun ***until*** you get the Vulcan
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:53:40 because everything becomes expensive as hell
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:53:56 *and* the wait time to fuel the vulcan is 3 hours
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:54:25 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/570029528118722599/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:54:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:55:04 If i remember correctly, the A-class cars used to have 4
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:55:18 like 10 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:59:03 one tip i can give you is to basically stalk the events tab
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:59:16 even if your cars aren't that good you can usually win *something*
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:59:46 also the daily goals
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 14:59:49 literally everyone has that car in MP
creations-chat 2019-04-27 15:16:01 yeah it's been invented already
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:20:10 <@!429665143677255681> yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:20:20 that reminds me,
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:20:34 I used to be in one of the best clubs there were on this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:20:40 but now it's abandoned
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:20:48 like, no one plays anymore
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:21:11 we were in the top 10 leaderboard almost every season
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:21:29 at least 5 people were legend rank
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:21:53 it's the best rank you can have in MP
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:22:15 oh wat
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:22:18 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:22:21 what do you need to do to unl0c
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:22:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:23:53 also pro
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:24:21 if you play mp right when you unlock it, you won't really get that far
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:24:46 you've already seen thathttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/571476086958063641/Asphalt_9__Legends_4_27_2019_02_19_46.png
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:24:59 omg bro
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:25:31 Z4 actually useless tho
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:25:55 it's only good for doing the BMW event, in which you'd have to get the 3.0 hommage
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:26:30 ye camaro is good
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:26:42 if you have a chance to get the 370Z first, go for that
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:26:54 you can do events right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:27:49 that should be pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:28:14 the fuselage is nice, but the elevators look too long
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:28:30 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:28:59 all of the cars you get from that event are really good for people who just got into mp
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:29:37 just stalk the events tab and try doing everything you can
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:29:44 even the "finish race" reward can help
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:31:45 nice
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:32:41 the terezo millenio event also has some really good 'finish race' reward
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:32:49 idk what you need to do to unlock it though
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:35:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:35:54 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:35:57 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:36:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:36:30 but it's pretty good in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:37:17 I have one of a miura
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:38:00 RS200?

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:48:39 
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:48:46 literally took me 0.2 seconds to find it
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 15:54:38 that's how it's supposed to be
general 2019-04-27 16:22:57 <@!429665143677255681> ok so i was doing the terezo millenio event, they 'lend' it for free when you use it in that event and

plane-crazy 2019-04-27 16:29:16 ok

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 14:54:38 i get it but it's not funny
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 14:58:03 it's not even the proper use of that format
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 14:58:17 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 14:58:36 it's about levels of intelligence, not levels of relaxation
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:15:55 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:17:22

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:19:06 everyone's planes do
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:19:16 why is that a problem
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:19:59 if the mass of blocks is reduced, planes will glide like they're made out of paper
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:20:20 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:20:30 have you ever flown an airplane in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:20:35 and turned off the throttle mid air
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:20:49 then you should know about it
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:21:13 still one of the best aerodynamic physics in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:21:55 wdym bruh
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:22:03 so if your plane is rightside up it falls faster?

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:28:35 it is
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:28:39 under 'common sense'
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 15:32:36 he's talking about voxl's rocket tutorial

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:01:16 the undo save button, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:20:03 idk what about you but if someone just submitted a plane ontop of another plane and i had no knowledge about planes i wouldn't know what the fuck im looking at
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:21:33 lm40000000
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:22:02 i wasn't talking about the jet
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:22:33 i know but i was giving an example
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:22:51 yes it got 8 downvotes overnight
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:23:11 from the same people who downvoted my and 3 other people's creations, and had nothing to do in the server beforehand
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:23:32 im sorry but that doesn't happen just because it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:24:20 
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:24:23 i have no idea who these people are
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:24:29 and 1/2 of them joined like 12 hours ago
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:24:50 im assuming, with the sole purpose to downvote creations in <#571411815511359495>
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:25:21 or just some idiots
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:26:31 not to be an egoist but my plane shouldn't have that many downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:28:24 good question
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:29:30 "greatly aims"
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:29:32 what
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:30:40 sometimes it just spins around the creation for about 7 decades before hitting it
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:31:56 PVP in vip servers is broken
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:32:20 it's related to the 'on impact' option
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:32:36 i doubt it actually works though
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:32:37 so lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:32:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 16:33:24 he probably built it using cameras

plane-crazy 2019-04-29 18:26:11 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-29 18:27:17 doesn't count as advertising if you're using it to report a hacker
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:40:55 i've seen one with at least 150+ tags
the-dump 2019-04-29 18:41:19 and it wasn't just "tycoon tycoon tycoon tycoon tycoon tycoon tycoon "

plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:27:50 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:28:33 i got bored pretty quickly tbh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:28:51 the amount of firebird spammers is just insane
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:29:36 freeze is basically as cancerous as firebird
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:30:02 all particle weapons are fucking gay
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:30:06 no skill
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:30:12 mrh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:30:14 Meh
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:31:11 but if a freeze comes behind you you're pretty much fucked if you're alone
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:31:35 a firebird can annihilate you very easily too
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:32:05 hi
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:32:30 also have you tried the 25k artie gun thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:33:14 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:33:24 I don't have enough crystals for it
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:33:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:34:54 good
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:35:29 it was bankrupt before it was even founded
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:37:00 I think
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:37:08 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:37:16 wait what
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:37:44 I remember there was a gun that was almost 25k
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:37:56 -and you could only buy it M1
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:38:10 o
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 14:38:22 ok
creations-chat 2019-05-08 10:02:16 there is no way in hell that a gearbox hasn't been 'invented' yet in this game
creations-chat 2019-05-08 10:16:35 doesn't mean that a gearbox hasn't been built before
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:08:36 pretty wild guess but it's probably because you can build a big peepee in there and most of the times no action is done against it
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:08:52 yes i know rick clreaslots *some* of them but not all
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 15:13:54 you can just buy multiple i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 17:51:54 nba
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:44:03 model train set sounds kinda cool lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:44:13 imagine a 1:1 scale of those wood ikea trains
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:44:35 
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:45:06 i still have it somewhere i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:45:08 or most of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:48:22 but buildings usually are big
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:48:35 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:48:42 it does for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 13:49:17 good
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:48:42 made with mematic
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:51:18 motor springs
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:52:42 we really don't but ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:53:28 we need the triangle wedgeblock 1x1 + 3
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:53:35 so it becomes triangle wedgebloc 1x4
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:53:46 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:54:53 what does that even mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:55:07 wedge ropes
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:55:44 so this
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:56:14 ohhh ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:56:19 so why call it rope wedge
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:56:22 and not rope corner
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:57:19 i get it but i'll probably never use it if it gets added
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:57:53 the way you place ropes should be changed imo
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:58:07 where you just click on one point
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:58:10 and click on the other
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:58:14 and it just places a rope there
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 14:59:00 not gonna happen lol

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:17:57 lots of car related stuff can get you inventor
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:18:01 so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:18:10 because they are
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:18:21 bus =/= car
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:18:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:18:30 your mom is lame
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:19:08 ok if it's easy make a CVT
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:19:14 super easy inventor
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:19:30 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:19:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:19:54 ok make it then
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:20:37 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:20:49 does fabric actually have more friction
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:21:15 it's a transmission that doesn't actually have gears
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:21:32 ok uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:21:41 i suggest you stop right there scum
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:21:56 go make a treadmill again or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:21:58 lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:22:23 
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:22:39 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:22:43 a yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:23:19 it's probably because you wrote 7 paragraphs about something that pushes you backwards
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:23:32 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:23:47 you are the first person on earth to call a treadmill cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:24:11 i never said it's cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:24:24 i said that it could get you inventor
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:25:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 08:35:36 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 09:56:53 nolej
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 11:59:20 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:03:53 yeah but you can't see more than 0.0001 cm in front of you
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:04:05 also anti aliasing is turned off
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:41:30 lmao nice deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:41:47 it probably is one of the rarest rank
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:42:08 voxel is the only one who has the server owner rank
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:42:14 or whatever he decided to call it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:42:25 ric is the only one with plane crazy admin
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:42:26 so rekt

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:42:53 yes rekt
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:46:57 i've never seen/heard of someone who's anti-vax in my country lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 12:47:08 at least some people are still sane
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:27:57 bruh you want inventor for some blocks connected to ropes?
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:28:30 so?
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:28:56 true, but 'unique' isn't really a word i'd use to describe it
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:29:06 you're essentially using ropes to lift something
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:29:32 what
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:29:51 because im god and u suc
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:30:16 also im pretty sure that i got it before you joined/became active on this server
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:30:36 dark what's that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:30:45 oh man
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:31:30 if triangle wedgebloc 1x2-1x4 exited it would probably look ten times better
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:31:44 how was that ego
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:31:45 what
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:31:48 i was stating a fact
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:32:36 I made a working convertible softtop for a car
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:32:49 that is unique, and is not just using ropes to lift something
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:33:36 if you think that you can get inventor for that door, i can ask for inventor if i made a trampoline with some springs
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:33:43 yeah ok i'd like to see you make one
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:18 some variations of doors can get you inventor
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:23 but not JUST a single motor
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:38:37 uhhhh
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:39:06 although that looked nice, i'm not the one who decides whether you get inventor or not
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:39:15 what
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:39:26 bruh just ctrl f
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:39:45 bruhhh
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:41:17 WAIT
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:41:25 did you really not know what ctrl f means?
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:41:50 i did
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:42:25 yes
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:42:59 although it wasn't the most "inventive" mechanism ever, it was very unique, it was probably the first of it's kind and it worked flawlessly
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:43:21 what
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:43:29 just mdae what
creations-chat 2019-05-11 14:43:31 ok show

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:48:23 yeah you made a convertible but it looks like it was one of those badly made aftermarket african ones
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:48:48 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:49:38 this game doesn't have actual fabric
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:49:47 so TECHNICALLY it is a hardtop
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:50:04 but it doesn't really matter
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:50:27 ok so what
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:50:52 you were trying to make a roof like mine right
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:51:11 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:51:31 ok yeah you made a convertible
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:51:32 but
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:51:51 it looks and works as well as this does
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:07 that's not inventor worthy
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:18 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:38 that's the point
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:45 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:52 what does the price have to do with anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:52:56 wtf
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:53:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:53:29 your point being?

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:54:45 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:55:39 deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:55:49 soft tops open like a hoodie thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:55:57 hardtops open like the one i made
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:56:17 but the gallardo irl has a softtop so i painted it blac
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:57:20 actually
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:57:27 i have a better roof, at the same size
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:57:30 hol up
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:57:50 not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:58:12 just proving that you can still do something that looks semi decent and not like the shit he made

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:58:51 made that on the first week of playing
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:59:17 yes it's better
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:59:33 but you can't make a hardtop like the gallardo that small
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:59:37 he's on mobile
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 14:59:56 i think i have a gif of it somewhere

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:01:16 chonk is another word for P H A T
creations-chat 2019-05-11 15:02:28 someone made basically the exact same thing but he made a chess board underneath it so that it actually has a use
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:03:01 i have screenshots of much chonkier planes
creations-chat 2019-05-11 15:03:12 he did but it was really simple
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:03:29 W I D T H
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:03:50 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:04:27 basically spamming layers
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:04:37 because that's the best way to design a nose
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:05:02 oh wait i have a picture of it was actual wings
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:05:11 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:05:50 not bully
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:05:57 just showing off some pics of chonk
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:06:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:06:24 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:06:30 because it's funny
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:06:50 at least it's not all layers
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:06:58 he tried™
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:07:15 7
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:07:40 also deci you thought the rudder of the other plane was gay?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:07:51 check this out
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:08:19 it isn't but it's pretty close to it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:08:25 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:08:30 paper
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:08:40 fold it to make the actual plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:09:06 it probably is
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:10:17 i remember seeing one who's rudder went all the way into the stratosphere
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:11:29 vertical stabilizer or rudder
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:12:42 ok i can't find it but here's a close one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/544627273136078851/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:12:55 someone who was trying to copy imperial's old 747
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:12:57 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:13:58 what about the quinjet
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:14:25 o
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:15:16 tbh that's not bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:15:55 you can't really make round noses like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:16:51 i tried making the nose for that around a month ago and it was hell
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:17:13 deleted it because there's no way to make the wings angle like that and still look not gae
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:18:03 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:18:32 your what
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:19:18 the one you placed on robo's track thing?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:19:33 the train station was made by robo
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:19:35 e
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:19:59 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:20:52 im pretty sure that not all had it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:21:15 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:21:36 B36 is still a pretty ugly plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:21:56 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:22:13 all of those can probably fit in my curiosity's wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:22:47 flonkl can i join
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:26:08 fonkl

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:30:54 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:31:25 bruh that's basically the best you can do
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:31:46 the limited amount of wedges won't let you make it better
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:33:06 yeah it looks simple
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:33:12 no, it isn't simple to make it in-game
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:41:26 i remember someone saying that they saw a block to block copy of an old plane i made a while ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:41:35 either that or he just saw me
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:43:52 dark
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:44:04 an alt account is not complete without a gay meme shirt
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:44:38 example
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:44:51 o you can't read the writing on it but whatever
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:45:17 purrmission to land

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:45:58 little kids will report you anyway though
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:46:23 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:46:28 i don't even remember where i found most of these
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:46:56 alts
creations-chat 2019-05-11 15:47:47 i wouldn't call it a spitfire but it's a pretty nice plane
creations-chat 2019-05-11 15:48:07 looks more like an f4u
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:49:10 deci usually talks to kids so it makes sense
creations-chat 2019-05-11 15:50:41 i think they do but the blocks they knock back disappear shortly after
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:50:56 uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:51:06 that's gonna be a pretty tight fit
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:51:19 you gonna fold it vertically right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:55:40 i once tried to make a 2707 and it looked like a snake when it was folded
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:56:28 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/544722974574379021/550421570074574848/unknown.png?width=592&height=136
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:56:32 massive bitch to fold
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:56:56 and i needed to have 60% of it in line because i made the -100 variant
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:57:06 e
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:57:23 split screen plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 15:57:47 not like i ever noticed it before but cool i guess
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:00:37 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/550744054523232276/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:00:48 virtually impossible to make the engine placement look good
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:01:01 they would've if i hadn't deleted it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:01:40 i was debating whether i should just make the fixed wing (2707-300) variant but that looks pretty ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:02:32 lol wait hol up a second
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:02:42 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:02:48 basically 2707+concorde
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:02:57 = lockheed L2000
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:03:13 bruh i should've made that instead
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:03:15 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:03:48 what bug
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:04:26 oh i think i know what you're talking about
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:05:03 you mean wings with less drag?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:05:40 if you really want to, just make a glider but it's actually powered by super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:06:03 or just make that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:06:23 you can paint pvp rockets
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:06:25 o
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:06:31 yeah true
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:06:46 that's possible bruh

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:13:42 bruh aws gay
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:13:52 stealth is for the gay

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:15:50 omg look at my KDR in a game mostly played by children!!!
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:16:29 that's because there is no reason to explit PC
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:16:34 no progression
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:16:50 when people hack is solely for "entertainment"
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:17:02 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:17:23 i haven't yet seen an exploiter on PC though
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:17:31 or haven't noticed one
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:18:00 mostly when people exploit they remove the map, spawns, insta kill everyone and replace the skybox with some retarded image
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:18:54 children be like /me is now an admin
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:22:30 in a children's game
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:24:33 ok but who cares if it's PF
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:25:29 lmao you're bragging about KDR and the highest level player in the enemy team is level 56
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:26:11 you have a level 275 guy covering your ass as well
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:26:33 it mostly isn't lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:27:07 if it weren't for your teammates you wouldn't have passed 10 kills
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:27:46 because you'd have to use a gun?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:28:00 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:29:16 i wouldn't be surprised if point started bragging about winning in arsenal
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:29:24 that game is literally child's daycare
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:30:21 deci did you look at the scoreboard
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:30:39 it's the best weapon for people who can't aim
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:31:31 i like using a gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:33:06 <@456226577798135808> that's what point has been doing these past 10 min
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:34:09 NO
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:34:27 deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:34:34 it's basically a child's daycare
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:34:42 no one knows how to aim at all
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:34:56 people bragging about their wins like they're at Esports
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:35:38 it's fun if you like annihilating underage kids with guns
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:35:48 but no skill is required
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:36:25 and it doesn't help that kids don't know what a FPS is
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:36:29 OR what aiming is
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:37:02 no wedges
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:37:34 brh what's that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:37:40 M200?

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:39:26 unfold
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:39:28 and then anchor
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:40:17 oreally
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:40:28 never
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:40:54 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:40:58 400+ results lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:41:30 only 17 results
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:42:19 you can replace pistons with suspension and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:42:35 and most of the times people don't care about pistons
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:43:05 still better than normal pistons
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:43:55 none of my builds ever depended on pistons
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:44:08 so i don't really care that much about them
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:44:27 locked pistons work but very rarely
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:44:32 and only on small builds
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:45:52 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:46:32 unobtanium
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:46:53 who the fuck thought of these names
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:47:29 what

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:50:40 deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:50:48 commit remove
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:51:26 i remember the advanced role joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:51:34 some kid asked for "advanced role"
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:51:41 probably referring to advanced engineer or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:53:12 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:54:51 he acted like one when he asked for that role
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:55:18 also this kept going on for like 15 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:55:36 just blacklist him
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:55:53 uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:56:02 so just leave

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:58:13 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:59:47 you don't have to sit on it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 16:59:59 you fly it by moving your character
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:00:10 but it shouldn't go as fast as he showed in the gif
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:00:11 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:00:33 i don't see people do it that often so idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:01:06 looks like he mightve copped himself a :fling command
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:01:16 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:01:29 why didn't you pink rick all this time lmao

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:35:18 dark you should probably just use wing panels for the time being
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:35:32 also how the fuck will it fly like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:35:52 that'll look mad ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:35:59 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:36:36 yeah it'll look really gay without a longer triangle wdgeblock
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:36:48 rick add longer triangle wedgeblocks pls
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:37:23 soon is quite a vague term
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:38:03 my sailbot is on hold until he adds them
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:45:46 worst chain 1991
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:48:39 theres' literally no difference
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:48:54 all the quality slider does is enable anti aliasing and more render distance
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:49:39 so just imagine the pic fonkl took but the map shows up more
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:50:17 you can see materials with 0 graphics
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:50:44 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:51:08 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:51:34 just blacklist him
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:51:47 i am
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:52:00 it's the lowest you can go
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:52:13 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:52:41 hell, i even have the graphics settings in studio set to potato quality
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:53:10 <@!263466687012143105> save and reload
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:53:27 still nothing?
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 17:53:45 something is probably stuck under the ground
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 18:02:59 in a practical sense, you can't
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 18:03:32 either make it a coaxial prop, use trusters to counter it or just make it a twin engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 18:11:51 depends on the purpose
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 18:12:13 also i doubt that a plot full of suspension is going to lag the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 18:14:17 is he still ramming you
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:27:50 dark how are you going to make the rear landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:28:36 i meant, are the treads going to be fake or real
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:28:45 uh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:29:09 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:29:29 idk if there are versions without it actually
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:29:46 ok nvm there are
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:29:58 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:30:07 but the tracked landing gear is epicer
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:30:22 because usa
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:30:47 lmao yeah i just saw that
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:31:31 you can also just make fake treads
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:31:44 and have ball wheels/tiny landing gear at the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:31:58 huh
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:32:33 oh wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:32:40 there WERE other versions
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:32:54 looks like the tracked one was the XB-36
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:36:41 he said subsonic
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:37:54 holy crap
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:38:02 he mega chonk
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 20:59:55 itsyourboyplays
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 21:00:06 now that is a real gamer's name
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 21:06:08 round 2
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 21:06:33 omg
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 21:06:48 #relatable
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 21:08:20 1000 degree block vs some kid's cancer turret
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:10:17 Ultimately, the Air Force had all earlier B-36 units reconfigured with the jet engines. With 6 propellers mounted on the back of the wings and an additional 4 jet engines mounted on the wingtips, the term "six turning, four burning" became popular.
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:10:23 seems like jet engine to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:11:49 
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:11:54 ye it's a jet
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:12:10 if you want
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:12:23 it's +10 ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:13:10 can you send a pic of where you're at rn
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:13:36 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:13:59 are the wings going to be folded twice or only once
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:14:12 if it's twice you might be able to mount the jets
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:14:15 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:14:44 it'll look like a clusterfuck of wings and engines when you're done though lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:15:02 if you look at it folded
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:16:06 you'll probably break 3.5k blocks easily with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:16:09 because of the wings
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:16:32 yeah much l0nger wings
plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:16:55 epic fail

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 22:37:06 vip as the guy who posts a picture of his builds every 0.07 milliseconds
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 15:46:41 jesus the wings look god awful atm
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:23:56 i love how he had to type your name with the correct capitalization

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:41:12 
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:41:24 the canopy is about right imo
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:47:38 under you mean she needs to use the half wedges that are basically sticks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:47:53 so what
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:49:50 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 16:55:01 it's not really good but it's definitely not the worst
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 17:03:19 dude people were just telling her to change the size of her canopy or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 17:03:59 ok so what's wrong with constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 17:04:31 what

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:14:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:14:41 have you ever looked at a real car's steering
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:14:59 the hinge isn't that fucking far from the wheel
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:15:41 it's only one step above the kids who connect the whole axle to one motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:16:33 
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:16:39 the hinge is located basically inside the wheel
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:18:37 it wasn't even that
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:19:03 under was just a dumb -50IQ and didn't notice that she was using half wedges
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:19:24 i wouldn't call that pestering
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 18:19:55 it wasn't done on purpose to annoy her

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:41:23 if you have a custom built PC and you maintain it well, clean it and replace the thermal paste when you need to
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:41:32 it should last for more than 15 years
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:41:41 depending on the make of the parts though
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:41:57 i remember there was a company that made PSUs that literally went up in flames
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:42:08 no uhh

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:52:55 not as much as the 8800 though
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:53:22 i don't even know if that 8800 still works lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:53:25 bet it does
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:54:03 in 60 years there will be a market for vintage GPUs and that 8800 will go for 700$ in an auction
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:55:03 lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:55:34 pretty sure that my brother's pc used to be a server lmoa
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:55:52 the place where my dad works didn't need it anymore so he took it home

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:57:29 spending 200 quid for a 20 year old piece of plastic that is either not useable anymore or very uncomfortable to use
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:57:32 seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:57:47 which connector does it have
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:58:01 don't the keys stick or something

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:59:08 this?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:59:46 i have a keyboard that uses that connector
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 19:59:58 it's from the early 2000s i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:00:12 but it's actually horrible and the spacebar is broken
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:00:21 also the pins twisting thing never happened to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:00:44 i won't since i don't use a 5 pin connector anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:01:11 oh that reminds me of an epic video

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:49:38 ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:49:45 it's not ACTUALLY an S15
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:49:53 1.something mil

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:54:43 huh
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:54:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:55:46 that's the 4C
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:56:10 ave u played forza street
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:56:24 e
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:56:26 i have
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:56:48 it's basically hold space (if you're on pc) and let go of it sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:57:20 back when i played it the karman ghia was the fastest
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:57:32 check which one is lighter
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:58:03 well obviously
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:58:32 and robo do you play top drives
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:58:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:59:28 i played since launch on the app store and it wasn't glitchy at all
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 20:59:30 so idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:00:19 ev3?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:00:26 isn't that a lego
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:00:38 OHH THAT
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:01:00 i haven't but i've seen videos of people playing it
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:01:25 wasn't it that game with very weird mouse controls?
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:01:39 ok so it was another game
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:04:34 guess how much time it takes to refuel it
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:04:53 3 hours 40 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:05:04 for 4 fuel units
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:05:35 and lower class cars like the GT350R take 15 minutes to refuel 6
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:07:45 no point
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:07:55 they just want you to pay money for tokesn
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:08:02 so that you can skip the refuling
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:08:29 like i said, D class cars take between 5-15 min to refuel 6
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:08:45 for C it's about 30-50 min for 5
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:09:01 after that it's 1 hour+ for 5
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:09:53 couple that with the event tickets and people will probably spend hundreds of dollars to not wait that long
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:10:29 lemme see if i can redownload car x
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:11:22 mobile

plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:12:06 it's a different game though
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:12:17 the only thing they have in common is the name
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:12:46 steam ver isn't
plane-crazy 2019-05-12 21:12:49 mobile is free

creations-chat 2019-05-12 21:52:04 coolio
creations-chat 2019-05-12 21:54:11 so you copied the wheels, the whole front section, changed the middle a bit and didn't include a rocket
creations-chat 2019-05-12 21:54:38 100% different, i'm surprised that anyone even noticed that it was somehow related to integex's

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 20:07:37 ok

plane-crazy 2019-05-13 20:16:05 games taught me that if you get in jail you have an 80% chance to become an undercover cop/detective
plane-crazy 2019-05-13 20:18:31 real gamers use opera

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 00:35:57 but rick is offline atm so probably nothing will be done
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 11:57:16 robo was the only one who frequently used it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 11:57:23 and then people started 'copying' him
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 11:57:35 like when vip said h or e and now the entire sever does it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 11:58:20 vip just likes to add it to every sentence he writes
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 11:59:42 google has a neat feature called search by image
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 12:00:01 you don't have to
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 12:00:04 just screenshot it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 12:00:17 so what

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 13:52:39 https://www.roblox.com/users/1007809378/profile
the-dump 2019-05-14 14:55:36 they had to fold it because it didn't fit in the build area
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:30:34 finally roblox is able to look like a modern game and not something from 1997
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:31:34 I really doubt that they had it look like that because it's "old and classy" or something like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:37:12 what the fuck does that even mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 16:37:21 so people just build electric cars or something?
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:02:36 you sure it doesn't work? because i played it 3 days ago on my new alt and it worked just fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:03:13 lemme try again then
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:04:19 yeah it worked for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:06:54 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:16:09 a mod likes adding e to every sentence he says and people just started copying him
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:16:16 there is no context
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:16:33 it means nothing
creations-chat 2019-05-14 17:23:37 what
creations-chat 2019-05-14 17:23:43 just change the file extension name
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:25:25 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:25:53 i suddenly see more "where's the mechanical section???" than i see people speaking in a foreign language
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:26:26 apparently not
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:26:32 he's still asking about it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:27:24 huh
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:27:36 i've tried it multiple times and it never happened to me
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:27:56 i did it to capture this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498473314445033472/577213870343716911/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:29:55 maybe it only happens when you first join the game
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:29:57 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 17:42:31 what update

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 18:13:46 the absence of longer triangle wedgeblocks is dangerous
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 18:14:40 that'd be nice to have
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 18:14:58 but it won't be coming any time soon tbh

the-dump 2019-05-14 18:29:58 do you have the "show fie extensions" option enabled?
the-dump 2019-05-14 18:32:36 on file explorer options, disable this
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 18:35:27 im the one where he becomes a 1x4 triangle wedgeblock
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:17:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:18:01 but for some reason no one deleted it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:18:04 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:18:57 someone also made the sofa from the lego movie
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:20:48 at this point i can probably just submit a plane/tank/whatever which is based off of something from rl and say that i built it from my imagination
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:21:33 i wasn't saying that yours isn't original
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:21:44 but like 3 people submitted obvious replications
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:24:10 guys look it's my 4A-GE MK.III mars rover i built it from my imagination

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:44:34 or is it still for windows inside only
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:44:55 i don't really care about the update apart for the windows sandbox app
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 19:49:21 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:06:56 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:07:28 hholy crap
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:07:39 the entire bee movie script takes 17k save data
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:08:26 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:09:23 for some reason i can't paste it more than once
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:09:33 i'll go on a new account and fill all the slots with it
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:11:23 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:11:30 all of these took only 3k
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:11:42 ignore the other 127k save data, that's from something else
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:13:07 nvm BAHAHAHAA
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:13:57 oh my god that menu is so fucking laggy now
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:17:25 im gonna just paste the bee movie script 10 times and put that into a save
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:18:57 
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:19:24 you need to clear your clipboard
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:19:31 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:19:34 you need to clear your clipboard
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:19:39 i have a code for that one sec
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:19:48 yes that
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:20:37 i just saved it in a .bat file
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:20:55 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:21:12 yes i've played that game before
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:23:58 nice so it's on par with a game from 2005
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:25:04 i'm pretty sure that the guy straight up stole the assets from NFS 2005
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:25:11 for the car model at least
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:27:20 which fps counter are you using
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:27:43 ew
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:38:26 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:38:31 you're joking right
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:39:06 that 'someone' isn't very smart then
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:39:45 you can very easily notice the difference between a 60hz monitor running at 60FPS and a 144hz monitor running at 144hz
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:40:05 everything is smoother
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:40:46 im good with my 60hz monitor for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:40:47 so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:41:35 i have enough money for a 144hz monitor but i'd rather spend it on other stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:42:04 i don't even have a need for another monitor
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:42:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:42:24 i'd understand 2 but why 3
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:42:41 but w h y
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:43:05 say you're using one for discord and another for a game
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:43:10 what the fuck is the 3rd one for
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:43:49 a 3rd monitor seems like a very expensive solution if you don't want to alt tab
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:44:16 and alt tabbing is free
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:45:59 hey that reminds me of that triple monitor razer laptop
plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:46:08

plane-crazy 2019-05-14 20:47:55 the surround screens used on racing simulators can cost over  $10k EASILY

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:06:10 which was submitted like 4 days after mega's toaster
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:08:01 if you had to build something specifically for the contest, i bet that only 10 people will participate
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:08:19 and only submit <500 block builds
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:08:34 my

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:09:05 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:09:21 my point is, not many people are going to build stuff specifically for the contest
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:12:53 time to finish my KV-2 and submit it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:13:10 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:14:23 it should
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:14:33 i haven't seen an axe ingame before
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:15:01 yeah that kinda contradicts your statement
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:15:56 perfectly balanced, as all things should be
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:17:37 again, no one has made an E-3 sentry before
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:17:41 so it's original
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:17:47 so*
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:18:01 i probably will lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:18:23 also your monster truck is original because i haven't seen an el toro loco before
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:18:37 ok i'll stop now

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:38:14 big succ
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:43:19 roblox's site being shit, as always
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:56:22 <@456226577798135808> look at the suggestion above yours
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:58:22 because it's shitty idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:58:37 also i REALLY doubt that the mods can efficiently enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:59:30 so that's *some*
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 15:59:33 not **all**

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 17:54:24 FUCK
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:33:15 he's talking about the "please like the game" text
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:33:20 not the loading screen
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:34:44 or they're just -7iq children who's brain cant comprehend the possibilities in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 18:35:41 since last week there was a spike in the amount of people i've seen building nsfw shit or people spamming rockets to cause lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 20:12:07 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 20:12:36 <@456226577798135808> please tell me that you asked that as a joke

plane-crazy 2019-05-15 20:58:59 i have to do the verification thing 20 times
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 20:59:02 ???
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 21:01:20 WHAT THE FUCK
bug-reports 2019-05-15 21:38:18 was that guy seating in your plane?
bug-reports 2019-05-15 21:40:32 weird, this usually happens when someone sits in your creation and loads theirs
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 21:52:33 i've seen a couple
bug-reports 2019-05-15 22:17:08 yeah but he says that it's not what happened
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 22:25:22 hey isn't it that guy who makes games where you blow up stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 22:25:57 it's full
plane-crazy 2019-05-15 22:32:46 pretty sure that it was a purge
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 15:17:09 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 15:17:10 please no
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 15:17:22 neon material will be abused so fucking much
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 15:28:11 can you send a pic of the front

plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:25:32 since when
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:26:45 if you're talking about the feature update, it didn't come out yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:27:04 the october update
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:27:08 was released last year
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:33:12 at least you don't have to do the picture verification 20 times every time you switch between accounts
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:34:26 oh so i wasn't the only one who had to do it
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:34:28 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:35:27 one time a bot sent me a video link for wot gameplay
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:35:36 and the thumbnail wasn't really family friendly
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:35:50 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:36:07 it was just a tank and a girl with minimalist clothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:36:43 she had 'clothes'
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:42:03 motors work perfectly fine for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:42:20 i am
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 20:59:13 <@!255361087262818304> ok but can it do this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/548247761720705028/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:09:40 yes pf really needed an AA-12
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:10:48 shid
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:47:48 wdym GT-R is hard lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:47:54 which one are you talking about
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:48:08 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:48:25 
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:50:57 ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:51:11 the R35 will look gay in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:51:21 i don't care how much of a god builder you are, it just wil
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:51:32 the R34 though, that's pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:52:22 I got lots of ideas for cars but first i want to finish my KV-2
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:52:55 planes got boring real fast imo
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:53:24 the only plane i want to build rn is a constellation
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:53:45 airliners don't look bad imo, they're just so fucking generic
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:54:20 if you build an A320 you've built 1/2 of all modern airliners
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:54:34 because you cant really differentiate them that much in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 21:54:46 aside for the nose, and some REALLY REALLY minor detail
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 22:46:28 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-16 22:58:47

the-dump 2019-05-17 05:08:33 i did that with the karman ghia
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:08:49 would show if this game's could saving actually worked
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:09:09 but you're using an android right
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:09:51 ok so you'd rather lose races and look better doing it
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:10:15 oh ok

the-dump 2019-05-17 05:11:38 yes
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:11:46 wait no
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:12:00 it was close but biased towards money i think
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:12:23 hm
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:13:02 did they add MP? or some sort of new gamemodes?

the-dump 2019-05-17 05:17:40 that was 4 months ago and still not fixed
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:18:46 yeah because you use google play
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:19:03 i don't know why they didn't just use apple's game center as backup
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:21:49 that's mobile game devs for you
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:29:32 i've just checked all their social media and they've gone silent about 2 years ago on all of them
the-dump 2019-05-17 05:29:33 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:39:39 if the tnt hits the ground or an object slower than the speed you set 'impact speed' to, it won't explode
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:40:17 it will
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:40:22 if you bump into something
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:40:30 well, it *should*
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:40:47 TNT blocks are very glitchy, unreliable and just shit in general
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:41:01 most of the time the explosion is delayed or it doesn't even go off
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:41:42 do what
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 08:42:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:05:00 who tf buys a pc only for roblox
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:06:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:07:10 knowing what a GPU is is the most fucking basic thing ever when it comes to PCs
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:08:41 that took a little too long to F12 and edit it didn't it?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:17:31 under don't you know what ratchet and clank is?

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:23:17 i thought it'd show the player's stats ingame
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 12:23:44 true

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 15:23:01 actually if you record with the built in roblox recorder it shouldn't matter
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 15:23:28 there is no way it can beat a normal mp4 file straight from OBS

plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:35:17 are you still questioning the retarded logic behind this week's contest?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:35:25 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:35:28 it be like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:36:31 I was never planning to participate so i don't really care
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 22:36:48 relatable
creations-chat 2019-05-17 22:41:07 the pins say don't crop out if you want ranks
creations-chat 2019-05-17 22:59:20 that's impossible, the quantum physics just don't work out
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:14:14 wrong, after years of testing, calculations and lots of late nights i can safely claim that such action is simply not possible
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:14:59 and even if it was, the boundaries of the universe may rip if you do that
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:18:00 wow
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:18:08 shame on mee6 for ruining our debate
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:19:45 AYE
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:19:52 get proven wrong
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:41:28 35 or 34
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:41:39 o
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:42:29 technically yeah, but there are some curves that you just can't replicate in PC
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:43:20 the B pillar for example
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:43:54 and if you're planning to have that slight curve on the rear, the lights might come out shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:44:08 hm
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:45:20 in what way
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:46:53 actually i have no idea how to get the reverse light and still have it not look shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:47:29 im assuming that the size of the smaller circles is going to be 2x2
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:47:37 and that's just.... no
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:48:04 that's one of the reasons why i didn't make an R32/34 yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:48:14 small detail like that just adds up
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:48:47 yeah that's the only way you can do it
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:50:29 so make the building grid smaller?
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:50:56 I'd love that
creations-chat 2019-05-17 23:51:10 only real gamers get this
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:54:33 it worked for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:54:57 ouch
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:55:26 I don't even rely on it that much so even if it happened to me, i never noticed
plane-crazy 2019-05-17 23:55:32 oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:00:45 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:00:53 fuck what's that game called
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:00:57 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:01:27 the game with the company is called motor world: car factory
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:01:54 I used to play it a lot but can't remember where i left off
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:02:21 it got boring to wait for donuts and when building the special vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:02:55 also i asked around the PCR discord about the cloud saving bug, turns out that lots of people have that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 00:03:17 it's been like that for months and the devs have yet to officially address it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:00 <#529858892075761694> i don't get it
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:17 ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 05:57:34 i never used the co pilot or normal seat so i never noticed
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 12:23:21 why edge

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:33:38 so you're not getting inventor for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:34:18 google exists
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:39:32 unique looking thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:39:56 i mean technically your 110's landing gear is unique and distinctive
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:40:02 not positively though
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 15:40:43 <@315771093010874369> who

plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:19:46 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:19:54 that doesn't even make sense
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:20:08 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:20:14 i didn't read the rest of the chat
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:22:51 the simple plane you build from the tutorial is enough to get a fine grasp of the physics in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:24:15 oh wat
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:24:23 did he actually copy mega's tank?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:25:55 he didn't
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:26:05 he said "this is nice, i'll copy that"
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:26:10 and mega though that he did
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:26:22 it's so obviously a joke that my brain hurts
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:26:44 meh
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:26:58 he's like flame but he doesn't know shit about anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:27:07 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:27:15 for what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:28:26 oh my fucking god
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:28:46 deci is a big idiot but to think that you took the "im copying your shit" thing seriously
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:29:09 yeah i get that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:29:20 <@456226577798135808> spot on
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:29:47 yeah he was being an ass and had lots of warnings, but he never did copy mega's tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:30:28 like i said, he's like flame
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:30:36 calling people names but it's an obvious joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:30:39 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:30:55 flame died 2 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:30:59 hol up i got proof
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:31:43 ?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:31:44 
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:31:47 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:32:46 fixed
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:33:11 not KIA
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:33:23 we can officially confirm death only after 3 months
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:33:34 right now it's only 2 weeks
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:34:14 in 2 months it'll look something like this
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:34:53 the GTO had it too
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:34:59 and it's much more popular
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:36:47 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:41:55 he was banned for being "overly toxic" and "copying"
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:42:09 he's pretty dumb but i don't recall him being 'overly toxic'
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:42:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:43:06 remember lastgamers? the guy who's Mi-24 was copied block for block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:43:29 he pinged rick at least 10 times trying to get him to clearslot the copier's save and he did jack shit nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:43:59 and now deci was banned for "suspected copying"
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:44:23 deci is a fucking retard but he's not dumb enough to actually copy
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:45:50 <@456226577798135808> yes he did
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:46:36 why specifically imperial
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:46:46 can't mega just provide proof that he 'copied'?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:47:07 so you need him to show proof of what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:47:24 it doesn't have to be imperial for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:47:27 and there is no proof
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:47:39 not as of now, there just isn't
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:49:15 so true
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:50:12 i'm sorry but how can you take"im gonna copy your tank's outside and everything" seriously, especially when it came from someone like deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:54:09 shoul've been trapmagnet
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:55:39 what wife what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:55:51 no way that this noob looser could get a wife
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:55:56 trap or not
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:56:13 i was talking about deci
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:56:25 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:57:40 DECADES???
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:58:17 i assume reproducing wasn't really on his top 100 list
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:58:43 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:58:54 ok but 30 years?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 16:59:22 what the fuck were they doing for 30 years
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:01:25 what language is this
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:01:29 also wtf
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:01:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:02:39 é
general 2019-05-18 17:05:54 anything is accepted here, this is basically #off-topic but people use this mostly for ksp
general 2019-05-18 17:07:32 yeah you can post it, it's called <#497142796961054721> because it's the only thing this channel is used for
general 2019-05-18 17:07:47 not because you can only talk about ksp here
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:09:34 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:09:37 what condition
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:10:12 so fullsize starts at 100?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:10:27 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:10:56 <@315771093010874369> justice has been achived
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:13:09 does the cause of death affect the price?
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:13:11 wait what
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:13:28 you deal with dead bodies and you don't carry a gun? amateur
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:13:41 5 bucks?! damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:13:49 that's a steal alright
help 2019-05-18 17:19:46 I think this has to do with mouse control, the game sets it up using your creation's center of mass, and it probably gets confused when you disconnect the tank
help 2019-05-18 17:20:06 try using keybinds instead of mouse control
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:35:40 i've seen many B-2s before
plane-crazy 2019-05-18 17:35:43 so yeah

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:37:31 meh, the slope on the hood is going to be really annoying to make
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:37:48 if i do build it i'll have to set up the hood like i did with the delorean
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:39:53 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499999549352312832/555770117330436099/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:40:20 wdym why
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:40:24 that's how it is on the real car
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:40:41 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:44:42 motors or ropes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:44:53 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:45:23 my tank is too big to copy
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:45:35 also most people who come close to it either freeze or crash
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:46:05 lag isn't really my concern
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:49:59 quote from deci "i don't like my roles" or something like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 13:50:25 
creations-chat 2019-05-19 15:43:44 imagine being new to the game and not understanding how to use every block
creations-chat 2019-05-19 15:44:17 what
creations-chat 2019-05-19 15:44:25 who said that he was lurking
creations-chat 2019-05-19 15:44:40 ok
creations-chat 2019-05-19 16:05:51 with what
creations-chat 2019-05-19 16:09:47 there's nothing to fix here, but you can make it look better by making use of wedges and half wedges
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:13:43 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:34:19 if you save over the limit, once you rejoin the game will revert to a save which doesn't exceed the max data
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:41:32 it's not even
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:41:35 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:42:43 how big fast
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:48:35 the quality though
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:49:02 that's from car crushers 2
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:49:20 or use snipping tool
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:56:31 when you really want the FXX K so you tell everyone to play the event in 3 languages
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:56:52 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:57:06 also this guy is a literal god in this game so idk why he'd want it so badly
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:57:34 he's basically carrying the whole club by himself
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:58:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 16:58:31 but i get some really good rewards from it so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:00:06 a what
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:04:44 why
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:07:59 why would you see that when you look for tiger tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:08:12 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:09:38 cannons have been suggested multiple times
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:09:42 i don't think they'll be added
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:09:59 rick was thinking about adding flamethrowers though
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:10:11 finna make an alligator
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:10:36 tbh ragdoll glitch is good enough
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:10:45 i don't get why you'd need a jetpack
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:11:14 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:11:37 inb4 he fixes ragdoll, adds jetpack and somehow fuckes it up
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:11:49 and then everyone says "BRUH REVERT UPDATE!!!11"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:12:02 classic
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:13:17 how the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:14:24 the usual excuse for spamming is 'my brother used my pc while i was gone sorry'
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:25 bots have to play the game before voting
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:16:27 so yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:17:35 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:17:41 don't call it richard hammond
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:17:45 it'll flip over and crash
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:17:51 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:18:45 I saw one guy stack wing lights in a line to make a laser
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:20:09 there's no way you were pushed that far from that but ok

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:22:00 
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:22:12 this game is good but there's no way that these are all real players
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:23:36 actually it is sunday so it kinda makes sense

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:58:26 so i don't know how practical it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:58:46 was planning to use it on my constellation
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:58:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:58:54 discord work
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 17:58:57 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:00:54 ya'll got inventor and stuff buthas rick ever called your creation cool?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:01:22 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:02:24 if you're trying to get inventor it shouldn't really matter
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:38 so it's not only me?
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:03:53 discord work please
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:04:26 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:15 did you actually get inventor for a butter knife
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:50 w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:05:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:07:46 remember when someone asked for inventor with a door that was lifted by ropes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:13:05 good
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:16:35 lol toxeed is officially dead
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:16:45 probably because he didn't release massive jet 2 when i told him to
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:18:43 what are you using to move them
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:19:25 it spins sideways because of the torque from the motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:19:42 1. replace the blocsk with wing panels
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:20:14 2. consider switching to a more reliable thruster like a super rocket or propeller engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:20:25 yeah propeller blades sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:21:37 yeah uhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:29 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:22:47 inb4 people ask for ragdoll glitch back
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:08 lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:20 use propeller engines
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:23:29 or super rockets, but that's a little overkill for that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:18 what's wrong with ragdoll glitch though
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:38 actually if you can hover in place with the jetpack, im sold
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:24:42 if not, gay
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:25:00 either a wing panel connected to a motor
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:25:11 or two propeller engines pointed sideways
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:25:18 or
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:25:57 onboard engine is more effective
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:26:16 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:27:25 even better than rudder
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:28:12 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:29:13 how did you get that angle on the wings
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 18:29:50 h o w

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:11:10 i'd spend it on a better gpu but ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:11:14 also
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:11:44 w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:11:48 which manufacturer
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:12:05 i swear if it's something like wish
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:12:31 i saw a video of someone who ordrered a 970 for one pound from wish
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:12:38 turns out that it was a 460
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:12:54 tbh still a good card for one quid though
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:12:57 so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:13:19 that's what i was saying
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:13:41 one of my dumb friends got a threadripper instead of a better gpu
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:13:49 and all he does is play games
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:13:52 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:14:03 "bro it's the threads!!!!"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:14:17 nah it was an improvement from his last CPU
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:14:30 but he could've gotten a much better cpu for what he was doing
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:15:07 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:15:12 drop the 9900
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:15:16 and get the 2070
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:15:27 an 8700k is more than enough
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:15:58 D O M I N U S  E X T R E M E

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:26:21 you can tell they named it like that so that people could be proud of it when listing it under "my battlestation"
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:28:36 wait uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:28:53 how does nvidia call their dual gpu connector thing

plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:29:15 SLI is barely supported now
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:29:23 almost no one uses it
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 19:29:47 it's not beneficial for devs to support it anymore

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:18:18 when the treads are only one block wider than the gun
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:19:24 proportional ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:20:07 talking about the treads
the-dump 2019-05-22 20:21:08 you must buy a gamepass to buy the jetpack gamepass
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:22:56 talking in general even though there's a literal channel named ksp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:22:58 ok
the-dump 2019-05-22 20:25:11 before buying said gamepass you have to buy the gamepass that allows your mouse movement to register ingame
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:27:43 oh god oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 20:31:29 i can't tell if it's spelt badly on purpose or what
general 2019-05-22 20:46:46 try it for less than 2 hours and if you don't like it just get a refund
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:11:05 people who have over 16gb ram and don't do any photo processing/video editing genuinely piss me off
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:11:32 bruh why do you need that much
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:11:43 bruh why
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:11:56 *ahahah it's for the 90346346 chrome tabs!!!*

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:12:07 how much ram do you have rn
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:12:20 and you're struggling with that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:12:25 h o w
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:13:14 depends on the manufacturer and clock speed of the ram
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:13:17 or whatever
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:13:29 there are some very shitty 8gb sticks

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:20 you'd be surprised to know how fast people find discord
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:41 either from a youtuber or being introduced to it by a friend
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:49 or a game
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:44:28 we use 0-100
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:44:54 0-100 is more A C C U R A T E
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:46:07 most of our teachers (in maths) just take questions from the book and switch the numbers
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:46:35 really easy to find answers on the phone since there's a database for all questions of every education book in israel

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:03:42 did you even click that link
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:03:43 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:04:05

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:04:28 sotp
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:04:38 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:05:21 after reading some chat history i think everyone who played the game before the update gets the jetpack for free
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:05:29 like infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:05:32 not sure though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:06:13 
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:06:24 better create TurboThunder60 right now
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:06:31 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:06:36 rickman logic
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:07:28 you're still paying money for a substitute for a useful glitch that shouldn't have been removed in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:07:49 that's like taking fast travel out of a game only to bring it back later as a dlc
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:08:02 or an improved version of fast travel
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:08:03 idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:08:43 rename the game to scaffolding crazy
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:09:30 everything is possible with bethesda
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:11:38 <@456226577798135808> why don't they put pontoons on the wings of planes in mars
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:13:29 do you just have a folder full of pictures of people in awkward positions
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:14:26 yeahbut 180mb of those 200 consist of shit rick says
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:14:59 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:15:21 and it's probably just inspired by racers like the P3
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:15:57 I love those tube racers lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:16:26 I tried building a lotus 49 but gave up when i reached the wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:16:44 couldn't get the size of them right
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:17:14 only people in <#544722974574379021> remember rick's 1tb of anime
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:17:37 i don't save nsfw stuff on my pc
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:17:46 but why
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:17:53 for what purpose
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:18:14 if it's the stuff you can't say i'm thinking of, why not just use the internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:18:40 makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:18:42 hm
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:19:30 i don't do that kind of stuff when camping but ok

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:26:40 oh lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:27:01 yes shelby v6
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:27:21 ok yeah the v6 was removed by 2017
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:27:40 so the facelifted model only has the 5.0 v8 and the 2.3 ecoboost
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:28:36 
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:28:42 brz is weak as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:28:59 i wouldn't buy one unless they gave it an sti variant
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:29:21 if i were to buy a two seater small sportscar i'd go for an NA miata BBR turbo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:30:03 i'm not a massive fan of the new ones
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:30:18 but the NA and NC ones are good
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:30:44 S2000 is also a nice 2 seater
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:30:53 but it's kinda pricy i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:31:12 depends on where
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:31:28 most preserved supras can reach 100k
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:31:38 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:32:08 i don't really know what about other jdm cars since i haven't been following the market lately
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:32:27 also since there are almost jack shit none in my country
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:32:40 israel
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:32:58 also i bet the R34 can also reach 100k quite easily
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:33:07 not to talk about the Z-tune ones
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:33:43 bargain
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:33:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:33:52 510k, bargain
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:34:13 510k for a refurbished nissan
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:35:04 how many miles
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:35:31 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:35:41 cool car but probably shit to daily
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:36:11 i love the front end of that and the montecarlo
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:36:27 wait shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:36:30 montreal, sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:36:45 
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:37:27 it looks a little worse with the lights on and the covers removed though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:37:42 
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:37:45 it has that "i've seen some shit" face
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:38:43 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:38:56 are they still producing anything other than that e g g
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:39:13 rip
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:39:40 if i remember correctly it's just a rebadged fiat 500
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:39:50 or it uses the same engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:40:19 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:40:42 didn't they start producing it back in 2005 or somhing
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:41:10 1995 HAHAHA
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:41:32 this piece of shit is being sold for more than 20 years

plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:43:43 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:44:14 yeah they made an HF version, somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:46:14 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:46:46 i have a notebook full of car's side profiles that i just sketch while bored at school
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:47:00 would show but it's 2:46am and im too lazy to look for it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:47:12 i made a couple of my own cars
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:47:20 some look like shit, others don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:47:45 i made some corvette/viper chinese knockoff that came out looking pretty nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:48:20 o i almost forgot about that car
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:49:15 it looks prtty nice, nowhere near my favorite though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:49:50 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:50:30 i had a nice drawing of a merkava I but i think i threw it away
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:51:00 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:51:09 i was working on one too but kinda forgot about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:51:22 i still have it but it's only the body
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:51:32 or the outline of the body, rather
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:52:03 the trueno isn't very curvy anyway though
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:52:13 apart for the wheel arches
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:53:55 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:54:25 half of my cars don't have wheels because i can never draw circles properly
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:55:15 i used to have a drawing compass thing but it broke and then i just stopped
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:55:59 i have that type of handwriting which only i understand
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:56:23 no one else can decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics that is my handwriting
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:57:03 damn that's really good
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 23:57:45 nice paper
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:00:14 the only good 3d drawing i have is a MiG-15 i drew 6 months ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:00:25 can't
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:00:38 it's 3am and i can't be asked to find my notebook rn
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:00:52 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:00:55 israel
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:01:11 
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:01:25 don't chat with people on discord at 3:00 AM
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:02:30 i moved rooms so most of my drawings are still scattered in my old room somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:03:08 i still in uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:03:27 retard moment here, but how do you call the place in the roof of the house
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:03:39 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:05:38 i can speak fluent 7 year old kid who just got acces to the internet
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:07:38 caliber?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:08:00 it should say on the bac
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:08:14 bye
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:08:47 my dad has a 7.62mm ammunition box
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:09:04 he uses it to store his lipo batteries and some other stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:10:04 you what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:11:28 yeah probably a 7.62
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:11:32 since you fired an ak
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:11:53 well it depends on which ak but im assuming 47 or akm
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:12:42 there were many variants of the ak lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:13:25 
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:13:28 RK62 lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:13:34 AK but uglyfied
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:16:21 wHAT
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:50 i've seen many wheel designs that work well on that track
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:29:55 also fuck your chain lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:30:10 can you send a pic of it
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:30:56 <#478584971670454284> you can report him there
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:31:26 rick can technically join and clearcurrentslot the guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:31:33 but he's offline right now
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:31:45 and he barely joins when it's about copying
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:34:26 you can just enable anti copy blacklist
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:34:32 and then blacklist him
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:34:46 that way he wouldn't be able to see whatever you're building
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 00:35:18 ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 05:15:28 yeah but you can only *fly* it
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 05:15:46 on grass or what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 05:15:52 so have i
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 05:16:01 but i want to land on t a r m a c
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 05:19:40 imagine buying one of the airliners without test flying it and then realizing that only 3 buttons/levers work
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 06:04:08 is the propeller the only thing powering the plane or are you using super rockets as well?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 09:11:14 [could not translate]
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 09:13:20 damn even thanos couldn't figure it out
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 14:13:17 should i tell him
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 14:17:31 grab already made the surface or mars
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 14:18:05 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 15:21:04 NYTT
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:38:32 certified bruh moment <:BruhMomentCertified:570774089099116548>
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:28 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:34 convertible mustang is shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:53 it loses the fastback body style
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:45:59 so it looks mad ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:46:24 if you  want a convertible muscle car get a camaro, not a mustang
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:47:08 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:47:26 i like all the camaros apart for the one in the 1990s
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:47:28 i do
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:47:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:48:35 camera
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:48:48 you mean camaro
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:48:52 and that grill is old news
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:49:09 how come
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:49:25 ok but why
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:51:09 yes but it's weak as fuck for a muscle car
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:51:23 300 hp from a V8 is actually crap
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:51:32 by modern standards
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:51:34 i know
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:51:42 that's what i was talking about
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:52:19 or just get the GT500
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:52:48 not necessarily
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:53:01 most flagship muscle cars used to have around 400 hp
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:53:08 in the early 70s
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:54:46 more cylinders doesn't always mean that it's better
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:55:44 you know what you're talking about and the only reason you gave is that it has two more cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:56:07 wdym you can't type
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:56:18 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:56:29 does suggestions blacklist prevent you from typing there?
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:57:40 so why can't he speak in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:58:46 the name "suggestions" kinda means that it's a channel for suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:58:52 not asking people how to build
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 16:59:01 <#478584971670454284> exists for that exact reason
the-dump 2019-05-23 18:08:19 
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:14:21 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:46:08 in the thumbnail you wouldn't even notice that it's giant
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:46:13 if it's taken properly
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:46:22 it just allows you to add more details
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:47:02 no you don't
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:47:10 who said it has to be scaled 1:1
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:47:24 people won't give a single shit about the fact that it's giant in the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:47:54 not like you can give people ice cream with the scaled one
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:48:08 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:48:41 what opportunity are you talking about
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:48:55 it doesn't matter if you can give ice cream to people in the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:48:59 i'ts a STILL IMAGE
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:49:18 also if you mean having a queue of people near an ice cream van, no
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:49:42 yes that game where you build shit? let's make it look like it's an RP game where you buy ice cream
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:49:54 ok so what
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:50:00 that tank in the other picture is massive
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:50:10 
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:50:20 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:50:46 yeah ok you can stick to that player scale one
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 18:50:54 but that VW campervan is going to win 100% so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:06:37 bruh it's not inappropriate
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:06:58 oh nvm
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:11:52 do i see an E D G E  U S E R ????
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:13:40 the E D G E on those wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:19:09 boi
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:19:15 i have that one too
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:19:25 but it's not transparent
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:19:39 retaliator i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:20:13 i still have my makeshift laser sight on it
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:20:26 just a laser attached to it with duct tape lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:21:17 wat
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:21:26 wdym fixed
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:21:59 how big is your creation
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:22:12 it does for me
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:22:16 well, block count
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:28:23 what are you going to do? shoot your screen?

plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:28:33 ok sorry
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:29:27 you'd probably die from hitting the elevator but ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 19:29:41 ik

plane-crazy 2019-05-23 21:58:59 discord can you work please
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 21:59:51 ight
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:00:58 huh
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:05:20 i built this front section a couple weeks ago but it's on hold now because i have better ideas of what to build
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:05:52 and honestly these wide fenders are a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2019-05-23 22:06:13 2005 mustang GT-R
general 2019-05-23 22:07:41 legit
general 2019-05-23 22:08:08 the only bad thing about it is that it isn't a steam key, you have to download it from the humble bundle site
general 2019-05-23 22:09:08 usually they give away steam keys (like they did with GRID 2 and some other games) but idk why they didn't do that with this game
general 2019-05-23 22:10:38 if you want, there's another giveaway going on, for GRID autosport
general 2019-05-23 22:10:48 https://www.gamesessions.com/en/Game/GRIDAutosport
general 2019-05-23 22:11:01 download it, play for 5 min and it's yours forever
general 2019-05-23 22:11:32 but again you have to download their launcher which is pretty shit and looks like it belongs in 2012
general 2019-05-23 22:15:14 GRID 2 was available on humble bundle for free about a month ago
general 2019-05-23 22:15:16 so probably that
general 2019-05-23 22:16:04 have you clicked subscribe to newsletter
general 2019-05-23 22:16:06 yes
general 2019-05-23 22:16:47 scroll down i think
general 2019-05-23 22:17:38 nah in with humble bundle you don't get a launcher, or at least i don't think you do
general 2019-05-23 22:17:47 i was talking about the gamesessions one
general 2019-05-23 22:18:01 i guess
general 2019-05-23 22:22:07 uh idk
general 2019-05-23 22:22:12 is that from jalopy
general 2019-05-23 22:22:31 if yes lemme download it real quick
general 2019-05-23 22:22:32 ok
general 2019-05-23 22:26:22 
general 2019-05-23 22:26:25 works for me
general 2019-05-23 22:27:07 
general 2019-05-23 22:27:09 i just downloaded from here
general 2019-05-23 22:27:16 or
general 2019-05-23 22:27:32 oh
general 2019-05-23 22:27:34 nvm then
general 2019-05-23 22:27:59 i thought you had another problem lol
general 2019-05-24 10:32:55 ok
general 2019-05-24 11:41:09 that's not very much lol, my dad was driving to his friend in the south yesterday and the temp was about 48-49
general 2019-05-24 11:41:28 and the car showed that it's 53 inside
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 11:59:54 <@!429665143677255681> i found a better example of how good this game's matchmaking is
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:01:38 notice how it's rating is 1009
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:01:45 and that ferarri is over 2000
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:01:56 so the evo is unranked and that f12 is gold
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:02:00 H O W

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:30:55 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:31:53 people hotwire it and drive off, for joyrides or just making profit by selling it
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:32:04 it was very easy to steal
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:32:53 you said quattro<sierra
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:33:00 you never stated why it was better
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:33:04 so i stated why it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:33:12 how is that irrelevant
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:33:27 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:34:44 i don't have one favorite, but i really like the quattro, GT40, 1969 pontiac GTO
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:34:56 i like lots of other cars but those are the top 3 probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:35:54 yes

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:46:31 but i think the CCX looks a little nicer
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 12:46:57 also the jekso or whatever looks mad gay at the back

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 22:46:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:03:00 the game doesn't really like it when you use autoclicker when using the build tool
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:03:22 asdgerh

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:11:52 if my tread is 2 blocks wide i wouldn't be able to get as much grip as i want to from the drive wheel
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:12:20 probably going to upscale it so that it's treads are 3 bloc wide

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:23:01 i think i've played that with a friend
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:23:18 tbh the models aren't that bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:23:23 everything else is kinda shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:23:45 like, if you start at "audi tycoon" it doesn't change what cars you can buy
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:23:57 your first car is always a mustang or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:27:50 vip went from having the same pfp for probably over a year to changing it every 30 minutes

plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:31:01 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-24 23:32:07 i think i'll just use pistons to stretch the tread

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 00:21:24 i wouldn't even call it a bayblade
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 00:21:34 it's just a spinny thing with wing panels and rockets

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 01:11:06 nevermind
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:08:03 <@251113404645900289> no, it's a classic because people like you resort to using it whenever you can't think of an actual insult, and it makes you look like a dumbass
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:09:09 how was I triggered in any way shape or form
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:09:34 he responded so he's obviously mad, ok
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:11:08 sound
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:12:12 ok mate
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:12:35 yeah
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:14:52 oh you're still on about that miata thing?
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:14:55 good lord
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:15:47 how the fuck do you get mad when you see two people joking about some shitty memes that i proposed to put as my t-shirt
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:16:49 i guess you couldn't ignore them after all
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:17:20 ok and
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:18:22 isn't your brain capable of just not looking at that channel for a few minutes until we stop? and even then, discord has that pretty cool option called 'blocking'
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:19:30 so after 10 minutes you got mad because we laughed at bad memes
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:20:54 impact font memes that we were posting ironically while also laughing at how bad they were
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:21:22 also that goes back to my other point, just block us
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:21:31 we didn't like them, what
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:22:02 alright
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:23:54 not even funny, it's just shit
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:24:07 the miata memes were a "so bad its good" kind of meme
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:24:10 that just isn't
the-dump 2019-05-25 07:25:07 we did laugh at them, but not because of the reason they intended to
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 07:28:33 didn't you figure that out from the 7m times katze called her sister?
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 07:29:04 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 07:33:34 you have to know what an anime girl sounds like, even if you haven't watched anime
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 07:33:42 the amount of memes about shit like that is insane

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:26:27 why the fuck does it have to be 5
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:26:47 one week ago, when i forgot that my VPN was still on, it asked me to do it 25 times
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:26:52 or 15, can't remember
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:27:46 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/578325475454091266/unknown.png

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:28:04 holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:28:06 big rip
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:28:31 it just stopped asking me to do it 20 times after a while
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:28:48 if you fail you have to do it all over
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:28:56 you only need to fail *once*
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:29:03 and it doesn't even tell you if you failed until the end
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:29:30 maybe because i have a shitton of alts
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:29:49 and they're all named the same thing with only the number being the differentiating factor

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:34:07 from above
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:34:19 can't help you then
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:34:21 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:34:34 when i mean folded i mean when you're not touching anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:34:47 what you're trying to do is *unfold* it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:35:11 just send a picture of it from above, in build mode
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:36:35 yeah you kinda fucked that up
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:37:00 when doing a 180 degree fold, you need a free space of one block between the two sections
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:39:17 doesn't really matter, you need to redo that rear section
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:39:41 look at <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:39:49 find 180* split joint
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:40:26 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:42:15 why
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:57:56 the fuselage is almost ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 08:58:01 everything else is just, no
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:01:57 hi king
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:02:23 i made a DC-10 a long time ago

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:06:09 you need to remake the elevators and rudder
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:10:25 why not just use a 19 blueprint
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:14:17 405 blocks is pretty small for a DC-10
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:24:06 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:24:16 pistons suck so much, it hurts
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:28:28 did he dm you <@315771093010874369>
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:28:41 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:29:56 i found how to fix locking pistons
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:29:57 somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:30:41 
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:30:51 silver is the piston, blue is whatever you're trying to push
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:02 that way it doesn't go apeshit when it tries to lock
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:10 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:20 wdym random
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:25 the jetpacks or piston
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:32 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:45 he direct messaged people asking for their accounts and alts
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:31:56 he messaged me, so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:32:05 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:32:22 probably only real gamers 😎
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:32:37 if he asked for your accounts you're getting it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:32:40 ye
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:32:50 it costs a 100 robuc
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:33:04 they are
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:33:08 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:33:13 rick said that himself
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:33:33 
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:34:04 fixing is the same as removing it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:34:28 oh i thought you were talking about the ragdoll GLITCH
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:36:06 nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:37:21 it sometimes does
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:37:30 it works much better than it does without it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:37:55 because the suspension *sometimes* locks the piston to one axis of movement
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:38:00 damping and stiffness is 0
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:38:04 free length is 10
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:38:24 also i don't really know how good it'll work on large builds
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:38:39 the one i'm using it on is only 600 blocks at the moment
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:46:08 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:46:43 my build is going to be around 1k-1.5k blocks so it might break when i finish it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:49:21 it's something that you can take screenshots with
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:50:13 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:50:25 people like using it even though it's clearly worse
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 09:50:32 and inferior to snipping tool

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:14:24 pretty obvious that it's an alt
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:18:47 ah yes, another member of the low frames club
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:19:49 you only needed to read his name to understand that it's another alt
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:20:06 he's probably creating another one right now
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:20:43 just turn on email verification for a few minutes
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:21:02 if he's smart enough to use a temp mail ramp it up to mobile link or whatever it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:21:44 typical loser who likes going on servers and being an ass

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:44:43 threads?
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:44:57 treads

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:45:13 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:45:20 :h:
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:45:22 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:45:35 why is it called haytch
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:45:53 but :h: was much easier to type
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:48:08 oh fric
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:48:39 i don't think that i can make the hydraulics
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:49:45 
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:17 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:25 hol up
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:32 every time it told me upload failed
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:33 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:40 for me it didn't send anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:50:58 can you screenshot what i said about the hydraulics
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:51:22 bruh discord
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:51:25 ok then
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:51:34 well anyway
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:51:53 this is the space i've got
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:52:17 i already have some sort of visual working hydraulic
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:52:18 but
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:52:59 not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:53:06 i have enough space for the arm itself
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:53:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:53:47 what about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:55:11 i can use this to fake a hydraulic lifter thing but it won't fit in the excavator
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:55:32 i'll have to use either springs or ropes
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:55:48 coincidence? i think not
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:56:25 i have that hydraulic on my mobile bridge but that's massive
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 14:56:39 so it's very easy to fit

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:03:24 isn't that just a ram
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:03:34 or was that before they rebranded it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:03:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:03:50 but they don't call it dodge anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:04:25 no idea why they did that but lol ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:05:04 you could also call it a ram 2500 when it was produced by dodge

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:36:51 jet engines are only used as a cosmetic lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:37:06 unless you've just started the game and you don't know what super rockets are
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:37:23 actually yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:37:36 i think lots of VTOLs use jets instead of rockets
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:38:04 really?
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 15:38:57 which jet

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:55:48 <:BruhMomentCertified:570774089099116548>

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:56:36 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:56:37 hype
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:56:43 when yesterday though
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:57:55 
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:57:57 it says yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:58:02 which means that today is tomorrow
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:58:13 which means that jetpac comign todat
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:58:26 u fly
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:58:52 i'd love to have it lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:59:09 it's really helpful when building in tight areas
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 18:59:58 finna flex the jetpack in public servers when the update comes out
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:00:20 but i got it for **F R E E**
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:00:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:02:28 the jetpack isn't really an unfair advantage
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:02:35 it's nicer to build with, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:02:43 but it doesn't have an impact on the builder's skill
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:03:41 you were able to make vehicles fly when using the jetpack while seated
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:03:44 but rick fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:03:58 yeah undo
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:04:24 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:06:11 if you rejoined after overwriting it, you're fucked
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:06:29 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:06:38 that's, your entire fault there lmao
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:06:59 if you couldn't realize that you overwrote it until you left, that's your fault
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:07:11 misclicked what
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:07:28 negative iq man
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:07:46 you can misclick twice  if you're braindead
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:09:11 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:09:26 cylinders exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:09:30 make your own wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:09:44 they do if you build it right
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:10:50 it doesn't turn as easy if you use it like a 6 year old would
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:10:52 like that
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:11:14 if you use an actual steering mechanism it works just as well as wheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:11:50 tank steering in a car is cheap af
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:11:56 and it's horrible to drive
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:12:12 yes but on a CAR
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:20:06 but rick is giving free adapters to cool people
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:20:27 <@!435946988559925248> there are
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:20:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:20:37 use curved wedges
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:20:51 the 2x2 cylinder is centred
plane-crazy 2019-05-25 19:21:03 and you can make an off center one using curved wedges
help 2019-05-25 19:22:27 5x5 cylinders shouldn't lag more
help 2019-05-25 19:22:40 actually i think they'll reduce lag by a lot
help 2019-05-25 19:22:58 depends on how big your plane is

plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:32:44 pro have you made an independent suspension setup with a steering rack before?
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:33:16 have you had a problem with the wheels toeing in when the suspension travels too much?
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:33:26 so is mine
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:33:27 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:33:43

plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:34:51 it's placed where the cursor is
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:35:37 yeah that's what i was doing before
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:35:40 but it's less stable
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:36:01 also you used it on a low riding sports car thing right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:36:25 yeah but the suspension doesn't travel much on yours
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:37:12 guess i'll have to stick with that for now
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:39:00 this is how it looks like when it's at point zero
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:39:05 wheels are perfectly aligned
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:39:18 nah the steering isn't what's worrying me
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:39:43 the steering is already limited by the wheel arches so i don't really need to anyway
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 14:40:25 i'll ask robo later
plane-crazy 2019-05-26 15:35:31 nice

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 11:26:26 You could just use curved wedges to make off center cylinders

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 13:54:38 i barely know anything about large vessels so lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 14:04:55 ever heard of that feature where you can postpone updates and update whenever you want to
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 14:08:05 if you want VR might as well get the 1070Ti
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 14:12:17 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 14:12:26 no one buys a cpu because it stays cool
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 14:12:55 you buy a cooling system according to the cpu you get

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:01:41 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:02:13 bruh ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:03:18 AN225 OMG

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:10:23 25 isn't that bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:10:46 lol rekt
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:12:17 how don't you know what an anime girl sounds like
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:12:26 have you ever been to the *internet*?
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:12:38 you don't have to watch anime
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:12:47 o
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:13:12 i've watched it
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:13:28 to be honest i didn't really liked it as i thought i would
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:13:36 people say OMG IT'S SOO GOOD AA
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:13:57 but in the second half of the show it's just "woah look how good takumi is omg bruhhh"
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:14:30 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:14:38 you built an ae86 and you don't know who takumi is
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:14:39 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:14:52 <@!429665143677255681> because it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:15:36 in the end it's just ryosuke saying how good someone is and then takumi wins and that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:15:51 electric yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:15:58 wait actually no
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:16:13 it has a 3 cyl but idk if it also drives the wheels or just a range extender
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:17:10 
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:17:44 yeah i forgot that it's called plug in hybrid
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:19:25 it's 2019, you can't really escape furries anymore
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:19:45 well yeah it has fake sound
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:20:05 like 90% of sportscars these days
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:20:53 no, i mean
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:20:59 the ACTUAL car has fake sound
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:21:28 the speakers make it seem like it sounds better
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:21:42 and they did some ridiculous shit with the exhaust
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:21:54 but that's what people want today
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:22:17 turbochargers muffle an engine's sound slightly
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:22:45 so manufacturers compensate by having the speakers play an engine note according to the revs
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:23:56 not a fan of teslas but i've got nothing against them
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:25:01 i wouldn't say that they're overrated, these cars can kick some ass
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:25:18 but it's the people who drive them who are just, no
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:25:45 shit like this
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:25:46 i mean, die
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:26:44 tesla wasn't the first to bring the electric cars to the mainstream
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:26:52 the chevy volt existed
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:27:01 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:28:05 i like some of the gimmicks of teslas and the fact that they can kick ass but that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:28:08 and yes they do
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:28:23 electric cars have to make a sound to alert pedestrians
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:28:41 from the  o u t s i d e
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:29:11 
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:29:50 because some peds are braindead
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:31:00 wdym here
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:31:29 nothowitworks
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:31:41 the only thing they need to build are charger stations
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:31:58 or superchargers, whatever the fuck they like calling them
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:33:17 yes but countries have their own electricity
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:33:39 you don't have to import electricity from another country for teslas to charge overseas
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:34:11 that's like saying that you need to import electricity to charge your phone
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:34:17 in another country
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:35:12 if countries don't want to build chargers it's their choice
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:35:32 you won't
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:35:50 if there are no chargers, electric cars won't be sold in that country
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:37:32 jetpac when
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:38:48 you'll probably die naturally before dying to the effects of global warming
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:39:34 actually i remember a show in discovery saying that something will happen in 2048 but idk how accurate that is
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:39:59 when the time comes there won't be anything we can do
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:40:13 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:40:29 i'll act harder while i die of dehydration or a forest fire
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:40:59 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:41:32 that's the temp 4 days ago
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:41:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:42:04 i don't remember it going below 18 in winter lol
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:42:16 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:43:05 oh epic
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:43:20 i won two contests so do i get two jetpacks
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:55:41 ngl it's the best looking build i've seen in a while
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:57:31 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:57:41 the point was that it's a contest for summer stuff
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:57:48 not contest for thumbnail material
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:58:03 the thumbnail thing comes second
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:58:04 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:58:42 but you're voting for the best summer build
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:58:47 not the best summer material
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:58:56 the fact that it's gonna be on the thumbnail shouldn't matter
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:59:18 also even if it does win it won't be on the thumbnail for obvious reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 17:59:53 double also
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:02:05 i won't be
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:02:11 it*
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:02:17 nice lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:02:29 test
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:02:51 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:03:06 well tbh nothing in the contest is related to the title
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:03:35 there is no real summer plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:03:50 unless you call an airliner painted as a hippie van a 'summer plane'
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:04:44 wow he didn't get that refrence
plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:05:21 yesw

plane-crazy 2019-05-27 18:06:30 i have no idea how a semi trailer is related to summer

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:06:19 actually the rarest role is probably community management so rekt
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:06:32 <#544022464133595166>
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:06:59 yeah i'm pretty sure that it isn't a role
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:07:12 what no

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:09:21 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:09:22 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:09:56 it'll probably be bigger than the hms victorious
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:10:02 if you dod end up finishing it
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:10:05 do*

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:29:21 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:29:35 one of the rare few cases where vip actually upvotes something
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:30:19 he downvoted the anime girl too
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:30:29 also vip is egoman5000
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:40:04

bug-reports 2019-05-28 12:49:10 the jetpack barely works when you are next to a laggy creation
creations-chat 2019-05-28 12:51:07 why the fuck did you ask that question if you already knew the answer
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 12:53:49 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:11:07 did rick ever say that there's going to be a team deathmatch mode?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:12:03

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:21:47 worst case scenario is that he's still using skype
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:44:44 someone called the jetpack pay to win <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:45:27 not everyone has it
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:48:32 
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:48:57 some of these tutorials just suck ass

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:53:56 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:54:03 looks more like a 1930's car but ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:54:24 nah it's a eurobeat car
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 13:54:37 heavy metal car when

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:02:49 that sno guy built some nice walkers
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:05:36 you need modeler 2
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:06:59 to be honest i've seen worse looking battlebusses in this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:07:17 and you can't really make a stick look ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:07:29 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:08:39 nice but it looks kinda bland
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:11:15 
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:12:05 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:12:32 make a garbage
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:20:48 another one
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:23:29 i've yet to see someone who bought it ingame
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:23:52 to get it in the main game you have to buy the one in the test place right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:24:13 
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:24:41 dev build
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:25:12 i had it on all of my accounts from the get-go so idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 14:25:47 or you get it for free
bug-reports 2019-05-28 15:39:04 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:41:45 oh god no
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:42:07 i wouldn't be surprised
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:42:21 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:42:59 it's just an anime girl with a backpack that has turrets attached to it
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:43:48 she can sexually identify herself as a ship
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:43:56 but she's not one
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:47:09 hats don't have collision
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:47:34 noob
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:50:12 this game uses r6 though
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:52:37 grass tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:53:49 ducc overrated!!!!!111
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:54:15 actually some small builds are x10 more impressive than badly made large builds
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:54:25 because adding detail is hard
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:55:06 i guess you've never seen a good small build
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 15:55:40 <:Haytch:559522204182773760>
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 16:28:36 back when the only thing you built were variations of thomas the tank engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 16:50:05 it is
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:16:30 probably because he hasn't seen it
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:17:18 ***like this***
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:17:27 **or like that**
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:17:52 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:18:05 ~~ok~~
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:24:26 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:34:31 wait
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:34:43 did you use 3 or 2 for that screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:34:51 damn
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 17:35:02 yeah ik why
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:02:40 he changed the cylinders again
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:02:52 now there's an off center one AND  a centered one
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:03:10 ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:03:24 but some people couldn't figure that out by themselves
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:24:36 i just joined the worst server imaginable
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:32:32 
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:39:47 ah yes, the trolling my 747 fiasco

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:40:18 yesterday?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:44:00 can rick ban people from pc for talking shit and being racist?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:44:09 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:44:51 ok i'll just wait for him to be done with that
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:55:24 the argument that a jetpack is pay to win makes no fucking sense what so ever
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:55:30 win what exactly?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:56:00 the jetpack has no effect on the builder's skill
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 18:56:15 if you build like shit, you'll still build like shit even if you use a jetpack
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:04:04 almost done with the arm ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:04:14 and no i can't make the main section look better

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:24:07 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:24:21 VW campervan not summer related ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:24:40 girl in a bikini is definitely not related to summer, seems more like a winter thing imo
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:25:43 ik
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:26:04 yeah that's not summer related though
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:26:09 and that semi trailer
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:26:26 + the locomotive
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:29:51 robo i can also use this
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:30:08 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:49:18 almost done kinda somewhat probably
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:52:45 oh
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:52:50 i guess i could try that
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:53:09 do you know what it's called?
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:53:36 yeah but i won't be able to switch between them easily
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:53:42 because magnets suc
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 19:54:03 i might make several other attachments later idk
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:08:27 i can lift shit now
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:08:40 big thanks to robo for letting me use his bucket mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:12:44 oh shit what

plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:44:38 he was demoted together with blackbird and another guy
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:44:45 barely
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:45:26 so a mod who barely talks in the channels he's supposed to moderate
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:45:27 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:46:10 paint block i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:46:20 if you paint each face with a different color
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:48:23 <@!429665143677255681> bruh someone made a veneno monster truck
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:49:02 unknown reasons
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:49:38 ok he switched to a car that's about the same size as my bronco
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:49:39 but
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:49:54 his steering is just a motor connected to the front axle
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:50:23 bRUH
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:50:27 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:50:52 i like having my wheels turn 180 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:51:07 insane turning circle
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:51:24 but how do you transfer power to the front wheels like that 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:52:34 just like i predicted, his wheels just got stuck 90 deg from the normal position
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:53:00 HAHAAH
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:53:13 next gen steering
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:53:57 even this truck
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:53:59 although ugly
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:54:03 it has actual steering
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:54:15 true
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:54:35 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-28 21:54:39 ED OG

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:10:54 the game doesn't like it when you try to pull/carry a creation that isn't yours

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:11:20 what
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:11:32 i assume the tug is also yours
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:11:48 
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:14:21 a creation that someone else built
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 12:14:52 i was saying that if you didn't build it, you can't carry it or move it around as easily
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 14:49:47 it's from the jetpack
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 14:49:49 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 14:49:57 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 14:50:05 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 15:25:04 boi

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 15:26:11 nice
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 15:37:02 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:08:54 bruh the laptop
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:10:40 it's probably easier to just press on the rubber directly
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:10:51 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:12:56 oh my god
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:12:58 when will this jet fuck off
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:13:09 people are still building it
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:13:15 for some fucking reason
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:13:57 probably because he built it when delta wings didn't exist
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:14:00 hol up lemme check
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:14:39 uhh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:15:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:15:26 pointman and fishtank both have made tutorials that look x100 times better than this piece of shit
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:15:50 i honestly don't mind people building their tutorials because at least they look kinda good
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:16:14 true
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:16:42 if you're that lazy and you're building something from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:16:46 at least choose a good one
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:17:49 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:18:39 building a tutorial just for the sake of 'flexing' whatever you built is just sad
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:19:10 it's like pressing a button to finish a whole game's campaign and unlocking everything
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:19:21 no thrill, no nothing
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:19:29 that's what i'm saying
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:19:43 bruh just go play jailbreak or something
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:22:27 meh
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:22:39 i don't see any use for it, to be honest

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:53:20 you do realize that p2w means paying for a huge advantage over someone who didn't pay money
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:53:39 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:53:45 but not as big as people make it look like
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:54:00 if you build like shit, the jetpack won't make you a better builder
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:55:35 significant power

plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:55:56 what kind of advantage do you get with it that helps you "win"?
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 18:56:02 this isn't a battle or a race
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 19:06:36 so basically a 'try to copy someone' challenge?

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:13:12 mention rick while you're at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:14:21 building that flag is against roblox TOS
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:14:41 regardless of what people think of it, it's just not allowed in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:15:14 technically yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:15:44 rick can't enforce and delete every dicc or swastika that someone builds
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:16:26 yes we do
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:16:37 but rick already talked about this before
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:16:44 he said that mad doesn't trust anyone but him
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:17:00 nah that can be circumvented easily
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:03 i'd simply quit roblox lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:20 it's the only roblox game i care about
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:41 everything else is either simulators, just shit or overall boring games
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:18:54 yeah that's the problem
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 12:19:12 giving 12 year old children such freedom is too hard for them to comprehend

creations-chat 2019-06-10 12:40:24 it did around 1.7k and was very maneuverable

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:02:59 make sure to read the "don't fucking eat it" label
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:06:36 you probably won't die from the heat
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:06:45 rather from it's repercussions

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:50:28 rather
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:50:41 does the vehicle have an enclosed space you can get into
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:51:36 someone (kip, i think?) had a vehicle designed to glitch other vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 13:51:52 it was just a car that deploys 6000 parachutes into someone else

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:00:55 did you ask vip
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:01:04 if yes i bet he said no
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:02:34 kayn's ship will probably be bigger than the victorious
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:02:50 i can't remember if he's using 3 or 4 accounts though

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:04:26 well yes, but actually no
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:04:48 rick can rewrite the whole game but that will take at least 7 centuries if we're lucky
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:06:25 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:06:39 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:26:20 thanks decinoob
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:27:06 what the FUCK
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:27:59 it did not look like that on my screen
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:28:16 the magnet wasn't connected to the car and the treads weren't going for a joyride by themselves
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:28:26 how even-
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:29:12 i can create fake hydraulics
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:29:28 like, they look like ones but just use regular pistons
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:30:26 he probably meant an actual hydraulic
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:30:38 but that's near impossible
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:30:42 if not impossible
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:31:30 would be cool but not gonna happen
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:31:51 boi
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:31:56 mobile crane?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:32:06 super epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:33:49 are the wheels independent of each other or no
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:33:55 like the suspension
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:34:15 nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:35:36 how does that even- what
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:35:54 fps drops when it's stops
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:35:56 that's new
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:36:23 oh shitt
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:39:01 i was thinking of building one of those
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:39:20 /but how are you going to make the arm uhhhh extend?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:39:24 forgot the word for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:39:49 nah pistons suck
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:40:43 lots of smaller wheels are better than just a couple big wheels
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:40:53 it helps distribute the weight more easily
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:41:10 and people use it for heavy lifting
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:41:22 what else would it be used for lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:41:41 it's used when you want to lift something big but don't have the time to build a normal tower crane
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:41:50 or heavy, rather
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:42:10 lmao epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:42:20 not even glorified
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:45:14 chilling
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:45:16 >starving
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:45:54 it takes time for shit to weld
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:46:00 like
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:46:09 just leave it like that for a couple seconds
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:46:19 and move it slightly to see if it's welded
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:46:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:46:38 ye
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:47:12 mine are on lowest range and strength but ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:48:12 lol i tried to adjust my gun's elevation and the game froze
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:48:27 every fucking time i do something with this churchill the game breaks
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:48:51 what are you welding anyway
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:48:56 well yeah obviously
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:49:03 i use actual treads
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:50:11 why do you need to weld it though
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:50:30 no, i mean
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:50:33 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:51:06 wait how many parts
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:51:16 like 1.2k+?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:51:21 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:51:29 lol overestimating much
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:53:18 construction machinery goals
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:53:56 wdym full graph
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 14:55:26 it's so fucking small
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:02:07 im 4th i think
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:02:12 in activity
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:02:29 also katze is about to dethrone imperial
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:02:32 so lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:04:05 ok

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:08:02 are you gonna have the big counterweights or nah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:09:34 ingame mods never™
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:09:49 technically yeah, but
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:10:08 also that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:10:23 but some building games aren't as accessible as plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:10:39 pc just boils down to build shit with blocks
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:10:59 other games have more depth, like bym or whatever the new one is
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:11:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:11:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:11:37 some people just see that and don't get it, so they just leave
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:12:02 with plane crazy any 6iq kid can join and build their very own 9ft peepee
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:12:30 yeah, not here though
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:12:53 because lime green is the coolest color
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:13:12 ok so why are you using it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:14:02 i would say green is the prettiest but that sounds kinda gay
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:14:45 also shouldn't it be C O L D E S T???
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:15:41 best if you want to get cooked inside your car
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:16:04 yeah i saw that earlier
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:16:22 >when your scope is as long as the barrel
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:16:39 and he still has that thingy for the ironsight
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:16:41 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:16:56 perhaps
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:17:18 possibly
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:17:29 eraverse
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:17:40 sounds like a time traveling card
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:17:43 but you can only go backwards

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:20:53 i have to keep the A/C on every minute or otherwise i'd probably die
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:21:09 yes because that works

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:26:26 9 gag is gay
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:28:37 too wide
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:28:38 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:28:46 i don't even know actually
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:29:05 it's the 11200 right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:31:06 you sure?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:31:32 that's the specsheet of the 11200
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:32:37 or just say it's based on this
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:32:40 1500
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:32:47 what's your wheel setup again
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:33:02 it's even more different on the 11200
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:33:15 can you show yours
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:33:53 oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:33:56 nevermind then
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:34:46 also if you look at it from that angle the cab is about the correct height
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:34:51 i think

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:35:15 cmon embed ples
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:35:58 too late for that lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:36:14 why not
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:37:21 you can give the suspension up to make it more compact probably
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:37:32 or use a simpler suspension mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:37:34 ight
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:37:57 i mean, it can barely traverse any kind of terrain anyway
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:38:21 yeah ig that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:39:22 not only that, the suspension travel will just be shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:39:37 if you shorten it there's no point for suspension anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:40:47 im reading the spec sheet of it because im really bored ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:40:59 and it looks like you need three trucks to transport the arm
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:07 like w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:36 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:37 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:43 there's another part but it probably counts as spam
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:45 ok hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:41:55 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:42:43 make what longer
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:42:45 the chassis?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:43:53 haha yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:43:58 that's probably 20 plots of height
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:44:02 probably higher
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:44:12 and it's fine i think
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:44:47 even half of that would be pretty impressive
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:45:20 or fabric cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:45:37 but then it wouldn't be able to take much before collapsing
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:45:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:46:22 the crane operator cab extends too, i think
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:48:10 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:48:19 it has it's own arm
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:49:24 you can build it at the extended position so you wouldn't have to worry about it welding or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:49:39 that doesn't *sound* that hard
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:49:53 but shit like that just piles up
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:50:13 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:52:56 i mean the cab on my CAT wasn't much better
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:53:30 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 15:53:32 it's thin as fuck

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:09 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:10 hold on
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:33 some pics have this arm setup
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:37 i mean it doesn't even have the main arm
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:47 on other pictures it has the arm but no cab
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:51 at the base is different
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:24:55 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:25:46 it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:25:56 that's what i showed with the 3 trucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:26:36 i'm trying to find info about it in the manual
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:26:39 but it's all in german
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:27:23 this maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:27:23 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:27:40 eh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:27:57 wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:28:08 exact same crane but top-down
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:28:09 no cab
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:28:24 w h a t  t h e  f u c k
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:28:54 invisible cab
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:28:58 brand new technology
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:29:28 
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:29:35 with this base it just comes like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:30:09 wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:30:23 that arm isn't even attached though

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:31:10 **W H A T**
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:31:31 you probably don't
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:31:39 i bet it's carried by another truck
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:31:46 and attached on-site
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:31:55 lma0 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:32:06 i guess that's a ballast on the rear
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:32:21 and the general weight of the arm is probably helping to keep it down
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:32:36 lol imagine driving that through NY or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:32:44 just clipping traffic lights
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:33:31 how the fuck

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 16:58:16 hopefully in a ford pinto that gets rear- ended
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:00:48 the base of the arm itself?
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:01:04 uhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:01:35 make it like that picture you posted
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:01:45 where the arm is really long and it's driving
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:02:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:02:13 without the scaffolding though
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:02:29 very long but looks pretty shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:03:02 like someone just sawed off a section from a tower crane it stuck it on the liebherr's arm
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:03:35 needs MOrE LeNgTH
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:03:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:04:23 sweet
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:04:46 if only there was a way to differentiate between the 4353453 variations of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:04:50 oh yeah, wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:05:40 oh yeah, the classic T3YVEF/T3YVENZF
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:07:11 the hitbox of it just sucks
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:07:26 rick knows about it but it doesn't seems like he can/is going to fix it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:08:10 it's not that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:08:52 the hitbox of it is something like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:09:13 if you put one next to it in the opposite direction it'll also weld
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:09:18 because plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:09:40 last time i tried it, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:10:02 rockets are just toilet paper rolls with a big engine
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:10:17 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:10:26 who said you can't color toilet paper
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:11:12 but the central core isn't like shit brown
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:11:19 it's brown, but not as much as shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:11:25 why are we discussing this again
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:13:06 mine ends in 10
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:25:07 <:BUYNITRO1:587693351860437192>
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:25:22 yes good use of the new emoji slots
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:26:36 buy 10 people nitro and they'll boost the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:30:26 i can buy nitro but i see no point in doing it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:31:00 the only good thing that nitro offers is the higher quality screensharing and increased file upload cap
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:31:09 don't care about animated pfps or emojis
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:31:20 and the nitro store, i can do without that
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:31:56 wait nevermind
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:31:59

plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:32:47 that's why i didn't change it when i had the free 1 month gift
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:32:54 i like my tag as it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:33:26 0mg imagine having 0420 tag!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:33:43 or even better, 1337 THAT'S SUPER EPIC AND ORIGINAL LMAOOO
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:34:31 In the United States, the Ford Mustang is officially unveiled to the public.
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:35:22 can it actually lift it though
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:35:36 at the front, at least
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:36:06 i used to have a shitty mobile crane as one of my first builds
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:36:14 it was an actual toaster with an arm
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:36:19 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:36:26 S T A B I L I T Y
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:36:56 just deploy the stabilizers and then anchor it or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:37:28 i wish i had as screenshot of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:37:59 when i figured out how to make the stabilizers deploy i felt like an engineering master
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:38:27 also yeah that happens with my excavator's bucket
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:38:44 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:39:07 wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:39:10 ok sorry im retarded
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:39:15 rope and suspension
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:40:02 make the rope extra T H I C C
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:40:42 yeah but with the 2nd option it will break less
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:40:43 probably
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:41:53 uh
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:52:29 <@!255361087262818304> i don't have stabilizers on my excavator, but in the bucket's mechanism the pistons tend to stick to eachother and they refuse to come apart
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:52:58 also i just went to get something to eat, i can join in about 30min
plane-crazy 2019-06-10 17:53:07 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:05:14 wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:05:19 wasn't evan banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:05:32 is he still making the map?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:43 ocean detail makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:50 because you can onlu see 5ft in front of you
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:08:54 only*
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:03 where
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:17 oh the studio settings?
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:33 i've heard about it but never bothered to play with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:09:35 oh alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:16 that looks like it takes more than 1/2 of the map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:18 why
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:29 what about train tracks
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:15:47 once you add those there won't be much space to play with wheeled vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:16:07 ok my point still stands though
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:16:16 ocean looks way too big imo
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:16:30 do you have a screenshot of the full map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:16:32 top down
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:16:46 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:17:56 understand what
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:18:35 do you have a picture of the full map
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:19:17 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:19:41 blackbird's and someone who was banned
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:20:03 fanmade i guess
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:20:31 from that one picture, to be honest, i don't
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:01 why is almost 3/4 of the map covered by water
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:03 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:21:10 typed that before it loaded
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:22:23 mountains look like they serve no purpuse other than filling a spot
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:22:40 because you can't drive over them or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 15:23:00 just make one large mountain with a road going accross it
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 05:20:38 it's a chuchill GC
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 05:20:49 still a chuchill, and yeah it's bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:21:54 this idea has 0 similarity to build a boat for treasure but ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:22:50 if you're not considering gamepasses, you buy crates
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:22:54 which give you parts
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:23:04 you're not buying parts directly
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:23:26 also the fact that you can buy parts doesn't mean that it's bbft
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:23:43 omg you use boats to make moeny??? BRO THAT'S BBFT
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:24:26 
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:25:07 like what
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:25:21 that's not strictly bbft
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:25:30 it's almost any building game out there
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 06:25:40 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 08:57:22 bruh is it just a spring attached to the barrel <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 13:46:50 why
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 13:47:07 robocraft battle royale already proved that this concept is a stinky shitter
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 13:48:11 also when you think about it, people would only use mobile turrets/planes stacked with weapons
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 13:48:17 no
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:50:50 bruh
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:52:17 google exists

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:00:33 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:02:40 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:04:32 why can't you just ask the winners directly for all that info and be done with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:04:55 lol\
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:05:53 
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:05:56 that number
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:10:55 you can already build your own gyro
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:11:16 swashplate block when!?!?!?!?!?!
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:11:39 yeah i remember that
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:08 you can link motors with a rod
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:13 so that they stay in sync
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:39 the prenzntnanthornthor has a very good gyro
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:12:58 don't use motor lock

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:27:41 it's clipping through itself
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:27:43 smoothly
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:43 i tapped it twice
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:46 also
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:55 motor lock isn't enabled on that motor
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:28:58 it just does it
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:29:03 also
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:29:17 damn that shit's hella compact

plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:32:17 i'd love to have something like a coupler lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:32:29 yes
creations-chat 2019-06-12 14:33:30 two things:
1) that control surface placement is horrible
2) ***W E D G E S***
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:34:04 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:34:17 i had a plane that had like 5
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:35:32 magnets create hella lag
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:35:48 and sometimes the jump to a specific spot when welding
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:36:02 it does nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:37:05 well yeah obviously anchor blocks stop lag
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:37:30 the game's engine will kill itself before you strain that GPU to even 10%
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:39:02 you don't need something that powerful
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:39:17 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:39:17 to run roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:41:38 they do
the-dump 2019-06-12 14:44:01 good
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:45:42 this is fine
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:47:26 bbbbbbruh <:BruhMoment:562310750819844106>
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:51:25 obviously it has the gpu tab
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:51:30 so he has a dedicated one
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:51:36 gpu 1
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:52:12 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:52:52 when loading or after loading
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:53:17 that's really shit for a 1k block creation
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:54:18 which 1060
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:54:40 doesn't seem right tbh
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:55:26 disable your integrated gpu
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:55:29 maybe
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:56:12 idk shit about laptops
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:56:19 you can probably disable it through the bios
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 14:56:21 somehow
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:15:07 xeons are cpus for servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:15:09 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:15:22 why the fuck would you use a xeon for gaming
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:16:19 SLI is shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:16:35 if you're planning on using it in 2019 for gaming you're just dumb
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:16:49 no one supports it anymore
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:17:54 water cooling
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:18:01 that would probably fuck your pc
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:20:51 lava cooled
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:33:02 no dont
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:44:12 my school has the i7-8700
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:44:17 and 16gb ram
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:44:19 for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:44:29 which atm is better than my own pc so lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:44:46 if my bag was big enough
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:48:19 if you get such a mad cpu chances are you have a good cooling system
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:48:27 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:48:43 looks like you're bathing the cpu
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:49:10 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:49:13 water cooling
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:49:14 ok mate
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:49:51 just put it under a cieling fan and it'd be alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:53:29 mine isn't really pirated
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:53:37 i just used a codebreaker thingy
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:53:48 there's this one guy
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:54:00 and he just gave me a paragraph of code
plane-crazy 2019-06-12 15:54:11 just put that in a batch file and it verifies

plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:23:29 it's probably bs
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:23:33 when was this posted
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:25:03 nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:30:39 have a couple of alts on standby
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:30:57 so when they do another giveaway you get a gift on more than one account
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:32:01 yeah no
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:35:07 so it's just generating thousands of codes until you get one that works
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:35:36 would be useful if you actually had a bot that could bruteforce it but it's probably just a generator
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:36:03 it probably won't work anyway
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 09:38:55 what trick?
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 10:38:08 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 11:23:04 now that's a good meme
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 11:23:37 you should switch the 'friendzone' to 13 year old traps in public servers

plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:07:56 that's even worse than actual nsfw images
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:08:38 that joke has been run into the ground by so many people and servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:08:39 bruh my internet is good today
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:08:39 it's not even funny in the slightest

plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:10:45 you'd think that they would've fixed his perms as soon as they found out about it but no
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:11:01 unfunny joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:12:02 when i was still a mod in the CC2 server we had an actual channel for nsfw, and people were regularly using it
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:12:05 that wsa sad
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:12:44 <@!194241218811658240> not as rare as you might think
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:13:32 the one in CC2 was deleted because the mods realized that 10 year old kids also used the discord (was before 13 y/o rule)
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:15:27 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:15:28 why

plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:43:27 ban that guy from roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:43:34 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:43:47 nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:04 i thought it spans to the back of the crane though
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:12 or was that another variant
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:20 o
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:38 ballast looks ugly though
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:41 like the fat one
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:44:46 yeah that
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:45:16 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:45:39 what about the crane operator's cab
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:45:57 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:04 what's the refrence
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:07 uh okay
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:21 oh lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:24 i've seen that
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:46 i saw one picture where it was neatly folded at the back or sometihng
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:52 and it wasn't just hanging there
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:46:58 lemme find it if i can
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:47:14 eh
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:48:23 no idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:48:35 i think it has a couple of mounting points
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:48:49 and you decide where to mount the arm or someting
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:48:56 cause if it's only one spot that makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:49:12 will it even fit with the arm though
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:49:20 or are you building it to the side
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:49:32 ol
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:49:33 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:49:44 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:50:22 lol nice fold br0
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:51:03 are you sure building the arm extensions in the retracted position and not extended is a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:51:40 i think making a spaghetti out of the other parts of the arm is better
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:51:51 you can probably get it to be longer too
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:52:12 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 18:53:20 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:19:55 they don't speak because they're dead
the-dump 2019-06-13 19:21:38 i got the joke it's not funny
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:46:57 is that a self upvote
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:53:21 not relatable
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:53:48 why do you have an alarm for 4am
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:53:49 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:54:09 it dont be like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:54:15 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:57:21 it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:58:49 uh no
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:59:33 works for me
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:59:44 reduce your graphics
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 19:59:52 it removes the outline
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:00:08 ok stay with the outlines then
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:00:13 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:01:05 you forgot that it's also slanted
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:01:12 and that it's just a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:01:36 bruh if you don't want outlines reduce your graphics, if you want good graphics, too bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:01:57 ah it's been a while since you've flexed your noses
plane-crazy 2019-06-13 20:02:06 or anything really

plane-crazy 2019-06-14 05:54:37 it's amazing how well they've covered the 21 name
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 05:54:49 there's little to no trace of it on the internet
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 05:55:03 but i've been to area 84 so i know better

plane-crazy 2019-06-14 12:27:01 ok so what
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 12:30:35 just click the dropdown menu on the top right
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 12:30:39 it's not that complicated
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 12:30:40 jesus
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 13:18:51 yeah uhhh almost nobody knows what that is
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 13:19:23 you should probably ask in a discord about game development or something
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 13:19:38 not a discord for a game which is directed at 13 year olds
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 13:19:45 or younger
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:32:17 you're gonna use pistons to extend it?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:32:25 i'm almost sure that it wouldn't work
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:33:17 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:33:32 worked as in lifted the crane like 1 stud?

plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:45:53 this is so sad can we ban deci
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:46:23 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:47:14 that was a meme im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:47:31 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497142796961054721/552274151948419075/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:47:42 barely even counts as a meme but idk
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:48:04 very 2019 like
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 14:51:07 i never needed more blocks so lol

the-dump 2019-06-14 14:53:14 idk which one you're referring to but they all suck
the-dump 2019-06-14 14:55:07 can relate
the-dump 2019-06-14 14:55:10 somewhat
the-dump 2019-06-14 14:55:34 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:00:36 imagine playing a simulator game unironically
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:00:41 and enjoying it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:01:12 belive it or not, it is possible, but
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:01:40 since under 13 year olds aren't allowed in the server  you can't find anyone who enjoys simulator games here
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:02:10 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:03:31 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:03:39 i'd rather play 2d parking games online
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:07 thanos maze
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:22 guess the meme LMAO
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:32 even that's better than playing simulators
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:40 obbys too
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:48 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:05:54 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:06:00 even if it sucks mad ass
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:06:09 at least you're doing something
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:07:54 didn't really care enough to buy it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:07:55 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:08:46 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:08:54 and i liked the hotwheels one
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:08:58 i know
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:09:08 but it's the easiest way to group them
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:09:31 i played it a lot on my friend's 360 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:10:09 i didn't
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:10:30 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:11:54 because EA's contract with prosche still existed back then
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:12:13 lol nobody uses RUF in their games now
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:13:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:13:28 i stopped playing it recently tbh
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:13:46 the only thing i do now is try to survive hypercar races without TC
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:14:32 drifting is pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:14:39 i mean depends on what car you're using
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:14:48 if you have the formula drift cars it's mega easy
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:15:00 even a 6 year old could drift the FD cars
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:15:39 find the FD viper on auction
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:15:53 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:16:08 i use the mustang and viper
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:16:26 uhhh i think?
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:16:54 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:16:59 justin something
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:17:05 i like that one
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:17:17 and the viper holds lower angle drifts for longer
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:17:27 like you can't grip at all with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:18:14 just get a 250 something hp RWD car
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:18:24 practice with that for like 20 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:19:40 ***resume***
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:19:58 ***bruh***
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:20:16 ***ok***
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 15:21:23 image a world where people actually read the pins before asking

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:00:30 but all she is is just a regualr anime girl with a backpack that has turrets attached

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:01:06 commit delete
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:01:21 the left corner
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:01:27 and also everything else
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:01:44 plus the fact that it's an ugly turret

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:13:37 attempted
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:13:40 no it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:14:06 you just admitted that it isn't accurate by saying that you can't make the slants look like irl
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:14:42 i don't care if it's 5 blocks as long as you say that iti sn't accurate
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:14:49 also that's not what you said ingame
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:15:26 ok don't say that it's accurate then
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:15:50 if you say accurate you're saying that it's spot on
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:15:55 which it isn't

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 14:20:15 it's more fun in large groups
help 2019-06-17 14:57:49 you can use blocks to limit the suspension travel but on such a small vehicle it'll look really bulky
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:11:25 building a pc isn't that hard if you're not retarded
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:11:33 also you can ask your parents for help
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:11:52 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:14:05 you can figure out the compatibility of a cpu with a simple google search
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:14:24 manufacturers always list which chips their mbs are compatible with
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:19:15 what update

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:24:21 a nap is sleeping at daytime for a short period of time

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:27:39 don't get a blower type because that's gay
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:28:34 it's the best cooler imo
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:28:58 if you're on a tight budget you should probably get something else
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:29:56 how much
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:30:06 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:30:48 i think the mini versions are much cheaper but some of them only have 1 fan
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:31:03 can't remember the manufacturer's name
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:31:46 what's his budget
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:00 get a gts8800
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:15 it's from 2004
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:32 because it is
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:42 you can probably get one for 0.5$
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:47 lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:32:53 amd apu
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:33:12 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:33:19 accelerated processing unit
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:33:50 it's a cpu with integrated graphics but it's better than average integrated gpus
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:34:11 which though
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:34:43 bruh what's your budget

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:36:11 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:37:39 not if you make one from cardboard yourself
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:37:58 make a paper heatsink for the cpu
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:38:02 problem solved
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:38:12 use spit as the thermal paste
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:38:29 or fire extinguisher foam if you have one close by
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:38:38 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:38:55 which 1070 were you using
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:39:03 or 1080
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:39:28 there is no rx1060
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:39:29 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:39:36 also imperial you mean 1060 6gb?

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:43:56 if you're only playing roblox
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:43:58 not much
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 15:44:10 idk how much impact it has on video editing
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:13:11 why prebuilt though
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:13:41 if you get a fully modular psu it should'nt really be a problem
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:14:04 also i just pirate my os
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:14:12 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:14:17 oh rip
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:14:27 7
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:15:07 to be honest you can probably built it on your own just buy watching yt tutorials

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:17:46 well if you built it from good parts, that is
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:17:50 yeah

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:51:50 what about a hdd?
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:52:13 that's not much for someone who's editing and recording videos
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:52:35 obviously
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:54:00 you don't need an ssd for everything
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:55:20 well tbh if he's only going to only play roblox and delete videos after uploading he won't need a hdd
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:55:58 hey

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:57:11 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:57:22 but for what he's doing it doesn't seem like he needs more than 500gb
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:57:32 hell, maybe even 250 is enough
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 16:58:03 tbh i'd just get a 128gb ssd and spend the rest on a hdd

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:22:16 explorer succ
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:22:30 edge is fine but chrome is much easier to use
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:27:08 we can play skribblio like figors suggested
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:27:30 probably not
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:27:36 it probalby works on mobile but badly
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 17:27:44 it's a browser game

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:25:46 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:30:16 the guy died anyway and he's not responding to anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:30:26 just ping vipnoob and tell him to reset the link
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:32:08 he only talks once every 5 hours
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:42:55 doesn't that chain cost robux?

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:45:21 meh
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:45:37 it'd be pretty annoying for whoever is managing that account
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:45:48 plus you'd have to check regularly for inactive players
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 20:47:35 kip your alts don't really follow that rule lol

plane-crazy 2019-06-18 00:38:40 you need to have an image for the but to submit it

plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:35:41 <@456226577798135808> yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:35:59 physics start acting on your creation before it's been fully loaded
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:36:20 it's really annoying, especially with tracked vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:36:51 i have
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:37:01 i showed it to rick ingame too
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:37:07 but that was 1 month ago so idk
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:37:24 also reloading it doesn't fix the problem
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:37:31 the treads will always melt into the tank
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:38:00 i had to build a makeshift brace to hold the tread as a single piece until the tank fully loads
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:55:06 ???
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 09:55:15 4 min

plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:09:02 the things on the turret?
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:09:26 well to be fair it looks more like a ladder than a bar
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:09:39 idk
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:09:50 it'd probably look uglier with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:10:27 noob i already told you what to do
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:10:56 so just anchor the fold as well

plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:12:01 bruh no
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:12:09 it'll look like a dinnertable with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:12:27 either keep it like that or remove it
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:12:43 literally the same shape as disconnectors
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:12:53 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:13:02 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:13:30 the real turret has railing
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:13:52 also tbh it seems like all you do is go against what me and kek are saying lmao

plane-crazy 2019-06-18 11:15:58 noob the only reason you're building it is because you think the anime girl equivalent looks hot

the-dump 2019-06-23 19:46:04 try driving on a wet highway with those
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:46:48 if i had children i'd just get a wagon
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:03 RS6 avant, E63 wagon
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:08 yes
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:18 also i can't remember how bmw calls their wagons
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:31 so just m3 wagon
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:35 or estate
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:50 wagons have much more space in the back
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:47:58 and i couldn't care less about ground clearance
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:48:01 so uh yeah
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:48:17 no wait
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:48:34 found it
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:48:37 M3 touring
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:48:43 yes they just add touring
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:49:37 the M3?
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:49:52 i'm pretty sure that it's just an M3 with an estate body
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:50:23 chance mind
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:50:38 ford mondeo is ok i guess
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:50:48 wouldn't get one if i had better options though
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:51:31 yes i saw

the-dump 2019-06-23 19:53:57 the only mondeo i like is the 2001 ST
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:54:03 because it was good in ford racing 3
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:54:08 but that's about it

the-dump 2019-06-23 19:54:51 focus ST/RS, mustang, GT and yes the raptor
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:55:19 if i were to get a muscle car i'd probably get a mustang
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:55:31 if we're talking about the current ones though
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:55:57 yes
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:56:07 gto best classic
the-dump 2019-06-23 19:56:18 best car of the 1960s

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:02:37 the only slightly offensive livery i have is a 510 with an anime girl in a not friendly pose
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:02:52 i downloaded it on accident and couldn't be bothered to replace it
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:03:43 i either use ones from motorsport or one solid color

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:04:46 i
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:04:53 i've never bought motorsport
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:05:26 my friend buys the newest one almost every year so i play it when im at his house sometimes
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:05:48 but i'm not going to buy both horizon and motorsport in the same year
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:05:53 alright

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:14:38 or at all
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:14:58 they just have a bugatti and shit just so that they can say that they have a bugatti and shit
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:15:18 also imagine taking a criminal to prison in a two seater
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:15:27 or to court

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:16:21 bruh what
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:16:36 US has one of the best police car fleets in the world
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:16:50 yeah crown vics are kinda outdated but they still haul ass
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:17:00 dude are you dense
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:17:08 they have modified explorers now
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:17:11 and chargers
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:17:21 do you live in 2002 bro
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:18:01 the vic is still in use just because they were manufactured  in such high numbers
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:18:05 and yet
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:18:19 it's still better than many MANY other contries's police cars

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:21:21 bruh they need hellcat interceptors

the-dump 2019-06-23 20:22:12 e
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:22:57 the shit they have on the window looks like the windows in nascars
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:23:00 and probably not
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:23:26 there won't be any more V8 cruisers like the vic
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:23:30 it's not efficient
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:23:39 ew gay
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:24:24 but now that the vics are getting replaced you can easily buy one for absolutely nothing
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:24:31 very cheap RWD V8 car
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:24:45 lMAO
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:25:55 not practical
the-dump 2019-06-23 20:26:01 chargers are better interceptors

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:03:36 and so is the pc reddit
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:03:46 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:03:55 https://plane-crazy.fandom.com/wiki/Plane_Crazy_Wiki
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:04:18 no idea who that guy is but ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:04:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:06:42 active subreddit
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:07:23 yes delete
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:07:55 this game never needed a wiki anyway to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:08:47 true
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:08:59 but this game especially doesn't need it
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:09:45 everything is very self explanatory and it's really easy to test a function that you don't really understand
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:09 it determines how fast your suspension rebounds
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:35 strategies like folding?
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:10:59 i learned to fold by myself
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:11:14 just saw someone's folding plane and figured it out alone
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:11:54 i know that this game and roblox in general is 90% little children but it's not something that i think is worth a wiki page
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:12:13 i've been playing since like i can't remember
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:12:57 i mean we have <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:13:31 but the only somewhat useful mechanism we have there is folding
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:13:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:14:09 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:14:46 lol noob
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:16:07 i join servers for the sake of joining servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:16:32 i'm in 30 something
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 17:16:46 but i'm only active in 3
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:14:46 not relatable
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:19:06 try a J3 seaplane or a DHC-6
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:43:02 that's not really a shotgun
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:43:06 it's more of a spinning volley gun
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:43:26 <:beruh:589676002221883403>
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:43:41 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:44:45 because he wants to look like an unranked noob
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:45:30 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:46:47 chinese
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 18:48:25 we know

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:08:19 bruh is that red car supposed to be a camaro
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:08:43 the side profile looks like a camaro but that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:10:10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsY5RG5N0T0&t=481s
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:10:13 better camaro
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:12:08 
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:12:24 "i think it looks like a camaro"
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 20:13:29 what document
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:07:57 looks like the heli in far cry 4 but just retardefied
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:08:16 uh ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:08:44 bruh you can actually run blitz on anything
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:08:50 it's not an accomplishment
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:13:17 you could also just ?avatar and reverse image search but alright
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:14:00 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:14:53 you can barely tell that it's a ufo lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:15:16 in your pfp it just looks like two lights on a black background
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:15:20 well yeah
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:16:00 deciblind
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:16:45 it's probably easier to find james' pfp because i don't think it was made by him
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:17:00 so it's probably somewhere in google images
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:17:09 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:32:02 just lock the motors
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:32:59 what

plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:34:00 it's not a vital part that constantly moves like the turret
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:34:04 it's just the fold
the-dump 2019-06-24 21:42:21 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-24 21:47:50 <@!255361087262818304> hey guess what

plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:46 skis just suck, they make a better cosmetic item than an actual ski
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:54 winter wheels are totally useless
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:48:07 and i would never use the snow blaster as a thruster

creations-chat 2019-06-25 13:10:52 looks like a cylinder
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 14:14:02 you don't need to rach a certain level
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 14:14:19 just get a rank from <#544022464133595166> by submitting a creation to <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 14:14:33 when you get a rank you can submit suggestions
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 14:19:41 dude it takes just 5 seconds to submit a creation

plane-crazy 2019-06-25 16:35:03 these are most likely bots, and not real users

plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:22:58 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:23:28 yeah i wouldn't get my hopes up
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:23:46 if it's any kind of suspension it's probably been made before
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:23:52 9 years ago probably
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:24:11 ok what
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:24:29 also even if it hasn't been made you won't get inventor for it
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:24:40 i don't even doubt it, you just WONT
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:24:53 or just use a vip server lmAO
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:25:03 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:25:26 just saying, it's a waste of time if you're going to build it solely for inventor
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:25:37 because you won't get it
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:26:01 not even discouragement
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:26:06 i'm telling him to not waste his time
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:26:15 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:27:15 just ask my mans deci, who tried to get inventor like 3 times and failed all of them
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:27:52 doesn't mean that you're getting inventor for it
creations-chat 2019-06-25 20:28:38 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:28:48 i didn't make a glitch
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:29:27 bruh exploiting a glitch doesn't instantly mean that you're getting inventor for it

plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:39:41 the best part about suspension is that you get to feel every bump and pothole on the road
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 20:41:05 noob what

creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:52:45 i said GOOD, not colorful
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:52:55 a block painted with multiple colors doesn't look good
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:53:35 also it's considered a low effort creation and technically should be removed from <#384025409945337856>, according to the rules
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:53:57 yes when you post images here it posts it there
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:54:19 ok
creations-chat 2019-06-27 11:54:43 i was able to accomplish a lot more with two hours though

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:24:57 the first one and a half seasons/whatever are good, the rest is repetitive and boring
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:38:51 the pontoons are wrong, if that's what they even are
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:39:22

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:42:21 the mix of wing panels and prop blades looks kinda weird though
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:42:35 i'd just use wing panels only but it's more of a nitpick tbh
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:42:38 yes i know
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:43:57 yeah but it shouldn't be on the seaplane version
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 13:44:21 also i'm pretty sure that it's where the auxiliary fuel tank usually is

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 15:54:51 noob shut up
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 15:55:50 everything imported to israel is also overpriced like a mf
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 15:56:01 i was checking car prices for fun with frieds
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 15:56:26 and you can get a new MX-5 in israel for the same money that can get you a Corvette grand sport in US

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 15:58:00 <:beruh:589676002221883403>

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 16:02:08 another example
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 16:02:48 by ordering all the pc parts i want from amazon, i save around 250$ if i were to buy them here
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 16:03:13 yes but not as much

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 16:30:33 oh damn
help 2019-06-28 16:31:38 it probably intersects with a block or something
help 2019-06-28 16:31:50 make sure that the motor has 1000 max torque
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 16:32:13 oh
help 2019-06-28 16:33:55 the rims are orange
help 2019-06-28 16:34:06 but you can only paint the whole cylinder
help 2019-06-28 16:34:15 so if the WHOLE wheel is orange, it looks gay
help 2019-06-28 16:35:13 mostly because this game doesn't like focusing on one specific type of vehicle
help 2019-06-28 16:35:38 a cheap solution (if you want) is to add a 2x2 half cylinder on the side of the 3x3
help 2019-06-28 16:35:43 and paint it orange
help 2019-06-28 16:35:51 but it does stick out quite a lot

plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:34:22 but i gotta go through so much shit for the treads to work
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:35:19 it's called "building something purely for aesthetics and then not realizing that i also need to make shit function so now i have to deal with a massive pile of bullshit as a punishment for not thinking about it in the first place"
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:35:52 same here
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:36:16 at least the churchill has fully exposed treads so it's easy to work with
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:36:23 not the KV-2 though
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:37:27 i thought about building a train but then i remembered how little you can do with it after it's done
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:37:35 sure yours would be cool in pvp and shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 11:37:51 but normal passenger trains will just end up collecting dust

the-dump 2019-07-06 13:24:58 although what she's doing is really scummy, she's probably drowning in money because of it
the-dump 2019-07-06 13:27:14 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 13:53:59 the white plane is G4M's, plane on the left with british airways livery is jail's, to the right is vip's and the one covered by the server name was made by vox

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:16:25 what the fuck
the-dump 2019-07-06 14:44:34 bruh that's not a T-34
the-dump 2019-07-06 14:46:44 ok
the-dump 2019-07-06 14:47:27 it's one of if not THE most popular american tank in existence
the-dump 2019-07-06 14:47:32 how the fuck
the-dump 2019-07-06 14:48:04 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:57:11 it's a flamethrower probably™
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:57:20 not the best looking tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:57:42 what else would it be then
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:57:54 also rick's been talking about flamethrowes a lot in the last 3 months or so
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:58:12 ok not a lot
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:58:14 but
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:58:35 
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:59:46 i won't use it because i never play pvp
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 14:59:58 and it doesn't look like it'd make a good cosmetic item either
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:01:14 yes lava inside a glass bottle
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:01:16 y e s
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:01:57 oh damn
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:02:07 
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:02:40 yes lava in a jar
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:02:45 explodes as soon as you spawn in
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:02:51 ™
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:10:16 lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:10:47 even if it is a thruster (i doubt it is), it's probably quite shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:13:06 ok but one looking like THAT?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:13:55 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:14:06 nobody would use it anyway tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:14:24 pvp is and will still be dominated by losers with turrets
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:14:58 the flamethrower probably has pure shit for range so it's not really useful in that regard
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:15:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:15:27 uh yeah
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:15:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:17:08 ok so someone built this
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:17:19 and it'll dominate every contact based bot you'd ever built
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:17:37 ok but it touched my 3k block plane and it was flung off the map
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:18:03 easy
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:18:53 i can build the arena
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:18:56 somewhat
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:19:12 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:19:19 but it has traps and shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:19:57 
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:20:03 most of the physics based traps won't do shit though
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:20:09 like the corkscrew thingy
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 15:20:28 uh yeah

plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:18:00 because most bots can't cope with the rough terrain
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:19:01 yeah that's what i'm trying
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:19:15 but people blacklist me because one of my walls was 0.2mm in their plot

plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:39:54 she gets a power boost every time it's convenient
plane-crazy 2019-07-09 19:40:06 yes

plane-crazy 2019-07-10 06:06:12 if you're in tanks like the AMX40 you can win games with insane odds
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 06:06:21 in tier iv games you're almost invincible
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 06:06:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 06:06:46 but it's slow as fuck

plane-crazy 2019-07-10 15:57:09 literally every prison in roblox ever
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 15:57:18 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 15:57:25 1p0
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 15:59:03 the one time i actually fulfilled my role as a cop in a prison game was prison life v0.6 in 2015
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 15:59:56 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 16:00:09 also prison life 2.0 sucks mad
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 16:00:23 it's just 0.6 but diff prison tbh
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:19 he has a better video editing software but it's hard to use
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:11:47 if i remember correctly, adding more save data is impossible
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 16:56:06 wat
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 16:56:07 why
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:43:28 so
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:44:03 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:48:45 turismo didn't even boost
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:48:53 it was bryan something
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:49:04 
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:49:08 why are you complaining lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:50:00 i guess he just wanted the items or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:50:26 the last place they'd be in is  in your account
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:50:56 yeah true
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:51:22 stealing your mom's credit card for the winter items isn't worth it
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:51:28 don't take that risk
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:51:35 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:51:53 they're not even that good as an aesthetic
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:52:06 snow blaster is ok at being a 4 barrel intake but that's about it
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:56:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:56:20 because adding what the players want is an insane idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:58:58 yes because we really need a flamethrower thingy right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:59:09 not only do i not care about it, it looks like shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:59:19 can't use it in anything for aesthetics
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:59:21 idk?
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:59:27 yes that's the problem
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 17:59:34 too many losers asking for it
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:00:04 make it look like a regular fucking flamethrower
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:00:30 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529858892075761694/596830607615590465/fb671efb5a376faf5e61891c41b0b0a5.png e
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:00:46 i can maybe use it as an exhaust muffler tip
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:00:53 but just for the TIP
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:01:21 it's a jelly bean that's been impaled with a straw
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:01:41 meh
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:01:48 it probably looks like the jetpack flame
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:01:53 or the rocket flame
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:02:21 i never needed flames in my builds so i couldn't care less
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:02:39 e
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:03:16 but it'll be exposed
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:03:22 and that's infinite gay
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:03:38 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:12:38 i've seen lots but they weren't exactly "good"
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:12:48 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:15:08 you can't really curve it that well to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:15:12 so this is the 2nd best option
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:28:27 yeah the nitro store is absolute shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:29:11 there isn't a single game on the nitro store that i like/think about playing
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 18:29:25 and plus, no one needs another virtual distribution platform

creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:16:57 how about trainer jets, those are pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:17:34 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:21:36 not a huge fan of original creations (at least not the ones that i've seen) but i gotta admit, jet fighters are pretty damn stale now
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:22:56 welcome back big gamer
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:23:53 wat
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:24:45 savage
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:29:04 rick's recycle bin
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:22 i couldn't care less about bad builds
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:25 what i do care about
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:38 is the fact that they think that it's worthy of submitting it to <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:47 looking at their build going "yeah that's good"
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:33:52 and it's total shit
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:34:43 the funniest thing is when people are surprised that they're getting downvoted
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:34:59 thinking that their plane is apparently the gold standard for PC
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:36:31 i don't really care about people asking for ranks even though they don't qualify for it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:36:39 this chat is for people to show off and shit
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:09 1) not always
2) not always
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:31 i've seen (and built) good looking interiors before
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:37 though some people just can't do it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:37:49 yeah that too
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:38:10 that's one of the downsides of having the majority of your server around 13 years of age
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:38:18 people's sense of humor is just crap
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:44:02 interiors are great because you can add lots of detail
creations-chat 2019-07-10 21:44:21 and usually it's a massive boost to upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:47:04 who
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:56:34 decinoob HAHAHAHA
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 21:59:58 *jiputtaja flashbacks*
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:01:17 robo doesn't warn, he just tells people to stop when there's an argument
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:01:24 at least it's something
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:01:25 e
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:01:49 00F

plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:06:16 oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:06:23 respect+
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:06:36 you are now officially not noob
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:08:01 <@456226577798135808> bruh really?
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:08:11 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:05 it's kinda sad though
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:19 there are some talented builders in troll's server, ones that aren't here
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:32 and for some reason they never thought of joining
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:43 damn should've been banned perm tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:54 putting cat ears on a destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:09:57 big no no
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:11:03 someone got god builder in his server for posting a white pedo van
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:11:29 
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:11:31 like bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:13:27 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:24:34 we aren't supposed to OFFER criticism, you're supposed to ask for it
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:24:45 this channel is for showing off, not helping you build
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:25:28 that's not my job lol
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:25:44 actually
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:26:02 if i see an actual turd of a creation i won't do anything
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:26:08 wouldn't even bother to downvote
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:26:25 if i see someone that actually tried, i might give criticism
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:27:04 many creations here were made by peopel who started playing days ago
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:27:18 they barely know anything about it and have little to no experience
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:28:11 when they try posting their not-so-good creations in the chat meant for pure flexing of course no one will care and just leave a downvote
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:28:54 imp which server are you playing blitz on
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:30:15 the only creations i bother to upvote are ones that actually impressed me
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:30:59 ok but which server are you playing on
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:31:55 just realized that what i said made no sense ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-10 22:33:21 ok

creations-chat 2019-07-11 08:40:15 posting a block in creations for the 1.644563e+16th time is not funny
creations-chat 2019-07-11 08:41:52 if you didn't get a rank 20 min after submitting you're allowed to ping a mod i think
creations-chat 2019-07-11 08:42:01 but vip probably won't give you the role anyway
creations-chat 2019-07-11 08:42:48 nice

plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:19:28 we were already level 2
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:19:41 one guy's nitro ran out and the other was banned
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:21:32 wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:21:48 no
bot-central 2019-07-11 12:22:14 !servers
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:23:00 someone's already doing that
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:23:26 <@456226577798135808> our rules don't apply to turismo's server i think
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:23:33 he might've posted the link in other servers too
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:23:59 my friend aspectroz (he isnt in this server) somehow joined the private server run by turismo fox
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:24:09 "can't join"
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:24:39 ok so he's probably friends with turismo or was given the link elsewhere
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:29:09 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:33:28 we have
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 12:33:51 didn't you notice how the banner was missing for 3 or 4 days

plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:16:00 i re-read that for a whole minute and i still don't get why he said that
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:33:58 literally the one you had before but purple
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:36:37 yes it's been like that for the past week
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:36:46 we KNOW
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:37:43 is that a rhetorical question or do you actually want an answer
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:38:37 because, to put it simply, it doesn't look as good
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:39:35 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:39:49 the reference has nothing to do with it not getting upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:46:14 it's not really a chain when someone contributes twice
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:47:30 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 15:47:46 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:26:22 gamer
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:26:30 inb4 he starts joining vip servers and trolling
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:27:08 ight
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:33:38 lmao i just joined vip2
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:33:51 he was there and basically left when i joined
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:34:03 wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:34:18 he wasn't really trolling or anything though
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:34:35 ys
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:35:01 he asked if he's allowed to join private servers while banned
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:35:06 and dontshooturself said no
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:35:14 so he might be alright idk
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 16:51:18 the letters SS followed by an iron cross

plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:07:08 not immune to being a big loser though
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:15 <@!338655422686691329> fabric material is basically friction block
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:29 just use the paint tool
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:40 you can convert every non mechanical block into fabric
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:17:50 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:15 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:18:40 if i remember correctly, only ice and fabric change the way blocks act physically
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:19:09 glass doesn't change how it acts though
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 19:29:49 gamer

plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:20:05 actually
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:20:50 it probably will, once the co-op update comes it ~~in 7000 years~~ soon, your friends might be able to use the pilot seat to control your build
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:21:49 not if you design it right
plane-crazy 2019-07-11 20:22:54 it probably won't be like that when the update rolls out

creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:54:42 you want modeler for a suspension chassis
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:54:44 ok mate
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:25 same thing
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:38 you're asking for modeler with a mechanical focused creation
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:55:56 for modeler you need a unique design
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:05 that stabilizer has no design whatsoever
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:23 yes
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:37 but giant tanks have already been made before
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:56:44 so it's not unique
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:14 "anyways though is that too bad for modeler at least?"
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:22 first of all, you asked for modeler
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:25 second
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:26 no
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:57:55 the chances of you getting inventor for a suspension mechanism at the moment is literally 0.00000001%
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:58:16 i'm sure that this kind of suspension has been built befor
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:58:18 e
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:58:32 should've checked if it was beforehand
creations-chat 2019-07-12 19:59:17 ok

plane-crazy 2019-07-12 20:47:41 noob
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:55:32 unique
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:55:50 yes
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:55:55 it's called a GYROSCOPE
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:56:16 ctrl f gyroscope

creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:56:41 so yeah
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:58:27 technically you can get it
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:58:34 not with suspension mechanisms
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:58:46 you can sit here and complain all you want lmao
creations-chat 2019-07-12 20:58:53 or just find something to do
creations-chat 2019-07-12 21:00:11 actually only like 15% of inventors are active

plane-crazy 2019-07-14 22:32:33 and why does it need to take 20% of the whole thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:11:23 it's like having a v8 in the 1990s
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:33 the fact that it's called plane crazy doesn't mean that it's solely about planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:52 you also have no use for a plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:16:56 you just fly it around
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 00:17:03 the same way that you sail a boat around
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 09:01:14 just you
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 09:12:31 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 09:12:48 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 09:16:06 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 09:50:07 some gun syncs do sound nice though
creations-chat 2019-07-15 09:57:36 why submit it if it's not done
creations-chat 2019-07-15 10:01:20 so that's your reason for submitting only 10% of your build?
creations-chat 2019-07-15 10:02:10 well yes
creations-chat 2019-07-15 10:02:16 but there's almost nothing to see here
creations-chat 2019-07-15 10:46:24 how the fuck can you compliment that
creations-chat 2019-07-15 10:46:29 w h a t
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 10:54:58 you don't
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:02:13 it's not hard
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:02:15 it's impossible
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:06:10 not very practical
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:06:18 and it'll probably glitch the pistons in one way or another
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:06:54 there will also be a slight gap between the canopy to the fuselage
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:06:55 so no
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:09:24 that's fucking ugly though
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 11:13:23 bruh
creations-chat 2019-07-15 11:16:38 when your handwriting is so bad that it translates over to pixelart
bug-reports 2019-07-15 11:28:52 i like how people still think that it's a glitch
creations-chat 2019-07-15 11:44:29 yes
creations-chat 2019-07-15 13:52:04 what's the motive of posting unfinished builds though
creations-chat 2019-07-15 13:53:28 that's what <#478584971670454284> is for
creations-chat 2019-07-15 13:55:40 true
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 13:56:17 no idea what you're trying to show here but ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:09:50 so that your suggestion could get ignored like everyone else's?
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:10:02 lmao nice
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:11:52 i don't think so
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:12:22 also we only have one guy with ingame admin and he's offline right now
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:12:26 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:12:44 yeah that's not gonna crash the server
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:12:50 not in a million years
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:13:02 but mad never responds to such cases
help 2019-07-15 14:13:40 shit what
help 2019-07-15 14:14:01 <@!177790932492615681> he's probably faking it
help 2019-07-15 14:14:16 it's a rare bug that happens in some servers
help 2019-07-15 14:14:28 just join another
help 2019-07-15 14:15:53 also control panels cause no lag at all
help 2019-07-15 14:16:31 uh ok
help 2019-07-15 14:21:21 oh
help 2019-07-15 14:21:30 no that's probably his doing
help 2019-07-15 14:21:41 never seen someone do that before
help 2019-07-15 14:21:42 huh
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:28:21 doesn't seem that hard and i've seen ones before
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:28:48 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:28:59 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:12 literally one of my first builds was a biplane
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:39 not garbage
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:41 just inferior
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:29:55 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:30:18 what are you building that needs both mouse control and keybind for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:30:21 also HAHAAHAHA
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:30:38 mans can't even built a plane yet he's calling that gross
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:30:39 alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:31:01 <@456226577798135808> he said combination
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:31:10 wdym aim
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:31:47 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:31:58 ok but why BOTH
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:16 i understand if you use one type alone
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:32:23 not BOTH
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:33:05 so you add double the control surfaces just for that
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:33:18 sounds fucking retarded but alright
help 2019-07-15 14:34:05 damn
help 2019-07-15 14:34:20 i'd tell you to ping the dev but he's offline right now
help 2019-07-15 14:34:43 and yes mad is also a dev but he does't do anything when it comes to ingame moderating

plane-crazy 2019-07-15 14:52:02 he's too young to be pissed off
the-dump 2019-07-15 14:52:56 you know what he built right
the-dump 2019-07-15 14:53:05 ok so
the-dump 2019-07-15 14:53:12 he built a 7k block destroyer
the-dump 2019-07-15 14:53:20 because there's an anime girl about ships

the-dump 2019-07-15 14:55:43 it makes sense because the tank was a hellcat

plane-crazy 2019-07-15 15:01:48 not really
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 15:02:01 they're just bad for replicating visual recoil
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 15:02:10 but it's either that or nothing
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 15:02:18 yes

plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:50:52 something like that
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:51:01 well not necessarily 1970 though

plane-crazy 2019-07-17 23:54:31 probably custom made
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:05:46 deci are you actually going to apply for mod
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:05:54 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:05:56 BRUH
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:06:19 do you really think that you have any chance of being accepted
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:06:49 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:08:10 ok but you do have like 14 logs
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:08:21 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:08:38 no you can't
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:08:45 not how it works
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:09:09 you have a spongebob emoji
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:09:10 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:10:07 if the ban is justified it's pretty obvious that the warns are also justified
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:12:16 my phone's case is thicker than the armor of a tank so it's impossible to crack
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:12:29 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:13:14 shooting it with a shell is more of making a hole in it
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:13:17 not just crack
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:13:30 bruh don't you have a screen protector

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:13:58 don't have a problem with em
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:14:07 actually it makes the screen feel nicer to touch
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:14:17 in my case at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:32:48 i'm not
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:33:10 not applying
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:33:40 can't be as active once the summer vacation ends, and also several other reasons
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:34:55 one of the reasons why i don't want to apply
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:38:59 not a very good supra to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 08:40:12 hawkeye impreza looks better imo
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 09:27:50 <@!561734378758340649>

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 09:32:44 hahahah no u!!! hahah funny!!
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:10:30 because vip does it
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:10:34 or did
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:13:36 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:13:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:14:05 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:14:27 don't
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:14:38 idk
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:14:44 he's been playing on vip2 for a while now
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:14:54 he's in this server so it's alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:15:06 mate#2217
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:15:10 don't want to mention
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 11:15:31 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:13:57 no because most of us real gamers got it for free
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:15:13 "boost our server for free useless items"
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:15:18 and a jetpack
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:16:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:16:58 yes most game developers need money
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:17:08 i'm pretty sure that it's how society works
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:17:23 actually he doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:19:42 <@456226577798135808> he does
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:20:16 but roblox takes a small percentage of gampass purchases
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:20:26 so when someone buys the tipjar he only gets 7 i think
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 12:20:31 or something close to 7
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:39:02 nothing here looks remotely close to a ford model t
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:45:54 i really doubt it
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 16:15:55 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 16:22:14 what does that mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 16:22:26 you join with an account your friend is logged into
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 16:22:37 so who's playing

creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:00:01 you may think that it looks ok, but when you've seen every fighter jet in existence being built in at least 50 different ways, people tend to downvote even the "ok" ones

creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:00:46 also jets are honestly boring to look at at this point if i'm honest

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:39:54 gay
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:41:30 troll calling your build "epic/god" is the equivalent of a 7 year old kid in a public server calling you a god builder
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:43:54 being complimented in a public server by 7 year olds means nothing but oK
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:45:03 so you like having your ego inflated with fake air
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:45:19 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:45:25 i'm real gamer air
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:45:34 fuck you mean mixture lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:46:02 more like 1% of blind people 😎
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:46:26 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:46:44 well there are probably less people who actually complimented him on this server
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:46:48 probably 3 or 4
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:46:57 maybe 5 on a good day
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:47:07 it is if i say so
bug-reports 2019-07-18 19:47:50 happens only to triangle wedges if i remember correctly
bug-reports 2019-07-18 19:48:08 place them again in the correct orientation, save and it should be alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:48:50 slow
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:49:14 not fast until you went inf speed
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:56:41 you can use half blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:56:46 instead of normal blocks in the wing
creations-chat 2019-07-18 19:56:52 to have it not stick out
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:08:26 that's why it's impossible to rev most car's engine to 10k
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:08:38 because something called a rev limiter exists
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:09:14 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:09:49 or a street legal f1 engine 😎
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:10:00 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:10:06 but if it *was*
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:10:30 noise complaint every .2ms

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:13:49 i'll try to have motorized control surfaces on my connie
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:13:53 maybe even use your flaps
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:14:03 but the wing folds midway through the flap so idk
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:14:16 yeah i expected someone to read it  as commie
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:15:59 <:beruh:589676002221883403>
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:16:01 flap is the red
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:16:05 wing folds in the blac line
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:16:17 so probably going to keep the flap to only one section
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:16:26 uh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 20:19:38 it's only interesting when several people do it at once

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:02:46 because gae
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:03:47 oh yeah when you get access they'll surely create vipcreations just because you're there
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:04:06 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:04:16 building a block is harder
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:04:21 some madlad did it somehow
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 16:04:26 got 80+ upvotes

plane-crazy 2019-07-24 09:15:01 second, he probably meant the use of a prop engine instead of a motor and prop blades

plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:06:21 don't care about the catalog tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:06:29 and it depends on which games
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:07:20 i think they ask the devs if they want their game to be prem only or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:07:23 probably
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:07:29 and rick is a cool gamer
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:07:33 so he won't do that to us
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:08:30 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:08:35 so the devs don't get a choice
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:09:05 "hey let us just limit the flow of players by about 90% without any input from you, the game dev"
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:12:44 
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:12:48 dunno if they're serious or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:12:50 but yeah

plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:13:16 i really doubt that they'd fuck up their game that bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:13:51 if people are getting so mad about it
plane-crazy 2019-07-24 18:13:58 why aren't they releasing a statement

plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:57:18 ctrl+f gallardo somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:59:45 ctrl alt del doesn't shut down anything
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:59:51 no matter the os
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:28:38 bruh why are you using cms for the car model
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:29:07 3d models
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:31:34 bruh red calipers on an suv
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:31:52 why R E D
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:32:19 paint it black or something
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:32:21 not red
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:32:43 plus with most rim designs you don't even get to see the discs/calipers anyway
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:17 not cool on a 90s suv ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:37 uh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:45 keep it an suv
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:46 like
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:50 K5 blazer
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:33:54 dodge ramcharger
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:34:25 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:34:38 
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:34:46 blazer looks better though
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:35:01 bruh that's
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:35:16 literally every suv rim design in the 1970s
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:36:09 if you want to see 🅱rakes make something else
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:36:17 cause it'd look weird on an suv like that
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:36:40 uhhhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:06 you'd probably have to make the rim itself bigger
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:20 because i don't think it'd look that good on a normal car
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:22 no
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:28 keep the tire the same size
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:33 just make bigger rim
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:40 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:42 low profile tires
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:37:46 look better on sportscars
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:38:55 uh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:39:41 if that's the previous width
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:39:46 just try placing the wedges
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:39:48 without the blocks
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:40:01 ok that doesn't really make sense now that i re-read it
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:40:37 materials
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:40:51 also that
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:41:01 yes long time ago

plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:43:01 sorta
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:43:14 but yeah the rim needs to be changed a little
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:43:24 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:44:14 what car are you going for
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:44:45 4-spoke rims don't look very good on most cars
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:45:06 robo has some interesting 8 spoke design but it's still not that good
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:46:02 i somehow gotta make these
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:46:04 but i probably will just make a custom rim
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:46:07 also bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:49:05 bruh no
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 20:49:24 good

plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:51:50 it's not a matter of worth it or not tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:52:08 the main point of nitro is to support discord and get shit along the way

plane-crazy 2019-07-25 22:57:12 imagine this involved in a mid-air collision
bot-central 2019-07-25 23:01:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 23:01:34 because it doesn't belong in creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 23:03:55 shouldn't this be enough

plane-crazy 2019-07-27 09:25:19 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-27 10:15:40 it's no use when you're the expert of stalking the server list

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 07:00:23 if we have the server on lockdown it means that people like this guy can't join

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:28:22 well obviously it went into the ground
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:28:26 because they're not attached
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:28:42 the wheels themselves don't have any weldpoints
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:33:24 dark have you ever played street racing unleashed

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:35:21 literally the entire game is about modding cars
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:35:26 well anyway
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:35:36 it was shut down a couple years ago

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:37:03 because can't be bothered to open spotify
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 08:38:02 also it's amazing how many times the word "ricer" is thrown around in this game
creations-chat 2019-07-28 10:48:00 bruh that's the tutorial car

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:55:46 what
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:56:14 if you've never seen a good A-10 it means that you've probably started playing this yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:57:47 pretty sure that you're talking about fishtank's f22
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:58:36 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:58:45 why the fuck did he make it a vtol
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:58:53 i thought he had more iq than fishtank
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:59:12 using the vtol engines probably doesn't help you pitch up
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 13:59:28 no they aren't
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 14:00:08 works every time for me
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 14:00:26 yes

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 14:03:07 haha noob
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 14:18:58 seen at least 10 of those
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:00:03 you just ruined it by showing the chat
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:00:34 could've just hidden the chat but ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:00:53 true
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:23:14 sounds really easy
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:23:44 i saw someone make a ppsh round drum mag that fired
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 15:23:50 so that's nothing compared to it
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 16:45:42 lost too much what

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:58:23 bruh suspension
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:58:58 what happens when you get rammed by someone
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:59:27 hm
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:59:52 depends on the mass of the ramming vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:00:19 if it's a 12 block car going 700 it probably won't do much
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:00:31 or anything at all
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:00:36 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:00:39 how

plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:01:19 my churchill gets like 120sps using only motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:01:35 because it's only 4 motors at 20 speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:01:53 but it goes like 2sps becasue of lag
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 18:02:03 still too fast for a churchill <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:26:07 they do if you open in browser
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:26:11 or that
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:26:12 huh
help 2019-08-04 17:27:44 not really server lag related
help 2019-08-04 17:27:55 i'm going to assume that you're using locking motors?
help 2019-08-04 17:28:16 gyazo/streamable/any recording software
help 2019-08-04 17:28:34 get gyazo then
help 2019-08-04 17:28:53 yes
help 2019-08-04 17:29:10 https://gyazo.com/en
help 2019-08-04 17:29:44 locking motors are unaffected by any outside force
help 2019-08-04 17:29:52 unlocked motors are the opposite
help 2019-08-04 17:33:06 is that a haha funny joke or are you actually serious
help 2019-08-04 17:38:06 never used gyazo so idk
help 2019-08-04 17:42:31 generally you don't want to combine pistons and motors together
help 2019-08-04 17:42:38 that's just asking for trouble
help 2019-08-04 17:42:49 pistons are already pretty glitchy by themselves
help 2019-08-04 17:42:58 mixing them with another mechanical block makes it worse
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:45:20 that would annoy the fuck out of people
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 17:45:37 especially if they glitch and it sends them to the sky at 1.45634534e+17sps
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 19:01:51 have the weeb be a duplicate of the muted role

plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:22:47 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:23:01 where the fuck are you cramming these generators at
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:23:37 my haron only did 35knots on max charge and i already had generators and solar panels in random ugly places
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:24:14 just bought the mallard though
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:24:17 slow as fuck
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:24:26 well without adding generators at least
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:24:40 bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:24:51 stock ship goes 15 knots without any upgrades
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:05 <@!429665143677255681> about 15knots but it takes forever to get there
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:20 i bought it and got 327k for selling my other ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:31 didn't take generators into consideration though
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:37 they just do
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:40 you place them down
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:44 ship goes big fast
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:25:47 that's it
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:26:07 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:26:22 not that i know of
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:26:27 also legendary
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:26:39 you should get a fuel tank for every 2 generators you buy
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:26:46 generally at least
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:27:06 look at all this space i have to play with 😎
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:27:33 when i can actually afford more generators i'll shorten the restaurant area
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:29:20 wat
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:29:23 help
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:30:13 oh shit just realized that i forgot to add staircases
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:30:21 that's a <:BruhMoment:562310750819844106>
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:31:05 all these solar panels are a waste of space smh
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:31:13 you can fit like 4 generators there
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:33:15 not really flexing when the non beta player has it
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:33:17 same here
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:34:39 ok yeah mallard goes 16 knots stock
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:34:52 i desperately need more generators
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:35:02 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:35:15 ok got 22k somehow
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:35:19 upgrade time
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:37:48 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:37:53 doing 19knots now
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:38:22 i'm planning on adding at least 8 more generators
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:38:33 so it'll probably do 28-30 without charge
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:39:04 6
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:39:22 not many solar panels atm cause i couldn't afford them
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:39:30 going to focus on generators for now
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:39:50 lmoa
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:43:06 25
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:43:16 35 is fucking useless
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:43:21 unless you're mad rich
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:43:35 not enough to justify 35w
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:43:43 the difference is way too small
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:44:04 i get more than 170k a day and still use 25w
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:44:36 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:45:27 imagine sailing on everything but full throttle
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:45:57 secret to what
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:46:11 the secret is
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:46:15 don't rely on solar panels
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:46:30 bruh more batteries than generators
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:46:33 b r u h
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:46:44 standalone, batteries suck ass
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:47:31 make space then
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:47:37 or just put them on the actual deck
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:47:47 i cleared up the bridge and had like 3 gens there
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:48:12 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:48:44 bruh clothes shop
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:48:52 it literally states in the menu that it does nothing
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:48:58 waste of free real estate
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:50:09 ok got 13 generators now
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:50:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:52:41 actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:53:03 crashing into the shore in order to turn is more efficient and faster than actually turning
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:53:09 so most of the time it's uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:53:14 encouraged
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 23:56:30 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:10:05 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:10:51 my heron looked like absolute shit

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:11:28 bruh don't wait
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:11:29 just pay
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:11:55 saving 1k while you could've been sailing and earning x15 more
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:12:08 why the fuck would you need so much supply
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:13:00 re

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:13:37 also <@!429665143677255681> bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:13:51 you only need like one freezer
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:13:57 a big one
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:14:16 just get one big freezer and fill the remaining free space with batteries or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:14:48 i have 2 as well
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:14:52 more than enough
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:14:58 lasts me more than the fuel does
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:15:05 so i just refill whenever i dock
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:16:08 gonna wait till my paycheck drops and then i'll call you poor

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:20:27 not at all
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:20:30 use double
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:20:36 double and up
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:20:56 try cramming mini suites and normal suites wherever you can
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:21:02 mega profit margin

plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:22:35 
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:22:47 did something like that to hopefully decrease crowdedness
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:22:51 yes basically
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:22:56 but it didn't really work
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:23:08 so now it's time to design it like a prison
plane-crazy 2019-08-05 00:23:54 actually neverminded i can't be bothered to do that right now

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:46:46 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:47:07 most upvoter
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:53:57 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:54:04 the last original creations contest
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:54:09 sorry, but it was dogshit
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:11 yeah but that limits the options even more
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:26 tbh i'd like to see a contest where people submit cool ORIGNAL builds
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:32 but not A FUCKING TOASTER
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:55:39 or ice cream battleship
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:56:31 grab's thing was nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:56:34 everything else
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:56:38 pretty large no-no
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:57:49 copying what thelastgamers said "Also, human Psychology works like that a Human associates the Known, to the Unknown, going after what they know instead of going into something totally different"
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:01 which is exactly why people don't build original
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:10 well one of the biggest reasons why
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:46 i don't hate stuff for being original
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:58:54 i dislike stuff for being poorly built
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:59:02 pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 20:59:50 doesn't matter what the actual build is in my opinion, as long as it is well executed and looks good, people will like and upvote it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:17 but at the same time, a good replication of say, an F-22 is more likely to get upvoted more
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:30 even though people are starting to hate jets now
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:35 so that wasn't the best example
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:00:52 can't disagree
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:22 commercial airliners are also boring now
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:28 well they always were
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:01:39 but now i've seen them all already

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:53:11 most twin fuselage aircraft will have a rectangle inbetween
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 21:53:14 for the elevator

plane-crazy 2019-08-13 20:38:49 some games's speed is tied with the fps
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 20:39:06 so if it's too low or too high the game speeds up or slows down respectively
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 20:39:15 usually resulting in shit breaking

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:12:43 he did the exact same thing, only using cylinders and motors instead
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:12:49 it does but lol ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:13:02 it's just a motor embedded into a cylinder

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:14:58 bruh that's like claiming inventor for a magnet drive using pistons instead of suspension
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:15:45 there was no way that they would've approved it anyway lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:16:24 it's called keeping <#544722974574379021> pure

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:22:02 gamer club
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 16:23:16 so the turret angle is adjusted by a more complicated motor

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:53:43 no amount of performance updates will protect the server from what's gonna happen tonight
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 17:54:25 yeah we might be able to move at 20 sps instead of 5

plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:40:32 if you don't know what it is
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:40:43 it's the mechanism that prevents planes from shooting their own prop
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:41:02 synchronizing the prop's rotation with the machinegun in some way
plane-crazy 2019-08-18 18:41:04 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:28:33 what's the motor speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:28:37 for both rotors
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:28:53 ok so probably something is off with the rotors
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:29:21 idk haven't build a single actual helicopter yet but that happened to me too
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:29:28 and i just changed something with the blades
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:29:31 can't remember what though

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:32:02 because coaxial helis don't actually need one

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:33:06 out of ideas then
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 16:35:41 rear rotor?

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:02:32 because
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:03:20 not really
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:03:30 it's just that they're built so fucking much
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:03:50 cold war is also allowed i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:03:54 so you can use t62
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 08:04:16 <:BruhMoment:562310750819844106>

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:13:33 never seen anyone abuse it
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:13:38 doubt people even know about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:15:37 bruh why is it supposed to be a challenge
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:15:54 building shit is fun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:15:58 using more ballsts isn't fun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:16:48 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:19:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:21:40 bruh so we have to suffer because new players are 0iq?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:22:02 not for me
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:22:35 other players as in new ones who will probably never play this game longterm like we are?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:23:00 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:23:50 or just have a reminder on the motor config screen
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:23:53 to not stack them
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:23:59 or whatever
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:24:13 yeah but most people don't even play the tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:24:46 s moment
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:25:01 oh shit little timmy's spinner is breaking
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:25:15 guess my tank will have to go slower because it's gotta be fixed
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:25:56 to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:26:15 i've never seen anyone stack motors for not joke-y reasons
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:26:44 lots of people
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:26:53 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:26:54 vip1

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:29:49 brUH
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:30:35 i only have 2 driven wheels for each tread
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:30:39 both are 20 speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:30:46 and it still happens for other players
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:31:40 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:31:44 too many what
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:31:48 too many what
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:32:59 ok so you want to lower motor speed but have that replication issue persist?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:33:36 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:33:48 ok how about
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:34:07 make new players read something about what not to do with motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:34:13 and only then give them access to it
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:34:21 brububrbruburbuh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:35:05 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:35:33 some helis are about to be gamershotted

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 14:53:22 @ her
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:01:22 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:07:06 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:07:11 way to complicated
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:07:18 and probably impractical 100
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:07:28 2 motors are much more simple
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:07:31 bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:13:03 <@382536652280692739> there are free community vip servers accessible to everyone with a rank
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:13:13 just get a rank and do !servers
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:14:24 yeah some are pretty easy
bug-reports 2019-08-21 15:15:34 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:29:56 probably triple blade
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:30:06 and bruh most famous
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:30:08 o k
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:30:44 ok so what

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:33:28 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/586850952368357416/RobloxScreenShot20190608_143414263.png
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:33:45 yes for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:33:56 think it is
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:35:25 he probably did when he updated the game 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:36:12 disable it in settings
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:36:16 somewhere
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:36:19 idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:36:37 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:45:09 it works for me but only once every 5463 tries
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:54:19 <@!255361087262818304>
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:10 that's not a v8 though
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:16 the one on the right has a v8
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:22 but not visible in the picture
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:49 standard beatle engine
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:55 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:59 and idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:55:59 that's a v8
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:56:43 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:57:02 that's why there's a bar surrounding it
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:57:08 which is?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:57:19 nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:57:50 imagine driving the golf w12
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:57:55 whatever that was called
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:58:02 gti 650 w12 i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:58:16 that
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:58:18 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:58:22 big wide
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 15:58:48 got the engine from the bentley continental i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:33:11 he said that "it can be abused"
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:35:58 not yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:36:03 and no idea super
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:36:10 rick has big logic
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:36:11 rick can you actually add a fucking strut block or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:36:16 like just the spinny part of the motor
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:36:19 without the base
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:36:42 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:36:46 this without the pink
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:37:02 idk how to call it
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:37:05 middle beam or soemthing
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:37:13 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:37:29 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:38:14 there was
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:38:17 but it was cancelled
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:38:31 disaster survival type minigame
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:39:46 even the jetpack isn't "pay to win"
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:39:54 because there's no winning in this game
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:40:16 jetpack doesn't help you build better
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:40:18 bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:40:28 eh not really
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:40:41 usually these contests are 30 minutes long
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:40:58 and you can't build that tall in 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:41:01 and yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:41:14 unless the contest is like about towers or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:41:27 that's only a problem if you're low iq
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:41:34 i know rick im trying to educate this loser
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:42:02 ube
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:42:11 u
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:42:16 _ _
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 19:49:30 i regret alt-tabbing
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 20:16:45 i keep alt tabbing in the wrong time
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 20:16:48 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 20:17:29 brburburrubrrurbrh
bug-reports 2019-08-21 20:18:39 yeah you gotta spam c for some reason
bug-reports 2019-08-21 20:18:50 i just click the copy button and press v
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 20:27:54 br
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 20:56:38 bruh that font
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:18:47 bruh double barrel for inventor
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:18:49 o k
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:19:12 yuh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:20:13 bruh so you can keybind 2 magnets differently
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:20:14 so what
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:20:22 brburbrubbrubrubrbuh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:21:31 yeah that's probably inventor worthy
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:21:38 not 4 barrel though
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:22:34 a working minigun would be quite epic but probably isn't possible
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:22:58 we can force grab to do it 😎
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:23:01 brburbrubrburbrubruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:27:52 you can believe but it doesn't make it possible
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:32:07 magnets
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:32:29 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:35:21 not really reasonable
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:35:38 if you blacklisted someone why would you want them getting in your plot when you're spawned
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:35:49 "If someone is blacklisted from your plot they should be allowed in and the red box should disappear when your vehicle is spawned."
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:36:27 ok so you did phrase it wrong
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:36:32 and didn't mention pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:37:58 wouldn't get as many downvotes had he mentioned that it'd only be like that in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:38:52 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:39:10 rick barely even looks at suggestions anyway
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:39:22 and if he does the chances of him accepting something are basically 0
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:39:44 never actually seen him accept a suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:41:06 you can spawn in the airport instead
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:43:42 bruh momented
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:43:59 just ask mad to do it lmAO
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:53:49 so not a minigun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:53:52 more of a gatling gun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:54:31 minigun is strictly the m134
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:54:44 gatling is just rotating barrel in general
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:54:51 i was referring to the one from 1700s
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:55:28 
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:55:30 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:55:39 this one feeds from the top
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:56:55 burbrburbrubrubuh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:56:59 why win8
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:57:33 you can now officially be classified as a loser
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:57:45 ok so loser 2
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:57:59 actually loser 5
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:59:01 bruh the whole point was the firing mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 21:59:25 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:00:26 pretty sure that exists
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:01:05 brubrubrubrbubruh

plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:02:31 not a fan of forwards swept wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:02:39 whatever they're called
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:03:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:03:59 yes stop
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:04:28 the f22 is so generic that you're now infected forever
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:04:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:04:40 seen a couple
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:04:52 plane
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:05:53 yes because the most functional design is what's currently being used
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:05:59 same goes with airliners
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 22:06:12 also yeah just ctrl+f mirage

plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:01:03 he didn't mount it on the sight
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:01:08 he mounted it on the carry handle
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:01:15 which has a rail on it
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:01:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:02:00 another bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:04:10 it doesn't require removing the handle
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:04:12 it's optional
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:04:30 you can mount a rail on the handle if you want to for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:04:49 yeah it's more practical to remove the carry handle but it's not a must
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:05:54 
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:07:25 ```The only advantage to using a carry handle mounted scope is money savings from not replacing the upper receiver with a flat top. And really the money savings isn't that much, You are going to spend $40 or $50 for a decent carry handle mount, that still requires you to used rings. A stripped flat top receiver is $89. Pull all your parts off of your carry handle receiver, sell your stripped receiver on EE for $75 and you will end up cheaper than buying a mount for your carry handle. (assuming you have the tools, or a friend with them, to swap the parts)

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 14:59:52 make the sails look folded out now
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:01:17 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:04:23 yes you need a motor to fold
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:10:08 this one hasn't started yet
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:10:09 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:10:35 nobody gonna submit anything cause grab is gonna win anyway
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:11:05 probably considered a structure
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:13:22 only other "terrain" build i know is your mars surface
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:13:31 and that
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:13:41 oh and pro's island i guess
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:17:38 just spam 56235 pictures
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:17:48 it's not like anyone else is going to post anyway <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:18:25 could also do that i guess
creations-chat 2019-09-03 15:38:49 don't know if you noticed but the B-25 has 2 engines, not 4
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:39:51 most of what you used to call "activity" was just concentrated cancer being poured all over the chat
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:41:13 this chat was never really that active at times like right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:41:45 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:42:45 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:42:47 that's also correct
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:43:09 i like how it is right now
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:43:33 epic
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:44:49 you do realize that the majority of this game's playerbase are around 13 years old
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:44:55 none of which have a credit card

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:51:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:52:08 mega i doubt anyone will actually enforce it
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:52:26 if it's even supposed to be enforced
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:57:06 or how about you turn off topic into plane crazy then
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:58:38 although i do agree that killing convos by telling people to go <#497142796961054721> is annoying, it's even more annoying to see the bullshit that sometimes is being stirred up on here
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:59:21 renamed to off topic
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 15:59:54 actually vip general is pretty chill

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:22:18 we don't need another type of wing for that
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:22:29 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:23:06 ok why would you want to make a single rotor heli without a rear rotor
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:23:37 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:24:07 i am planning on building boats but not 1800s warships
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:24:58 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:25:36 actually i started making that a while back but stopped because of the absence of 1x4 triangle wedgeblocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:25:49 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:26:39 yes grab
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:26:44 that's what i meant
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:17 don't really see how sails would work
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:20 ingame
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:29 meh
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:33 too many shapes
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:39 i mean i know how they'd FUNCTION
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:45 but in terms of looks
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:27:56 won't be able to make a realistic looking sail in pc
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:42 ok super you can just close the contest as soon as grab submits
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:48 no need to waste time
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:28:52 just start another poll
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:29:05 everyone voted but nobody finna submit
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:29:06 watch
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:29:15 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:29:30 grab is the only one who makes "scenery"

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:30:21 super how many people do you think will actually build a scenery specifically for the contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:30:26 actual question

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:31:11 ok we get it's not funny anymore
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:04 once you earn contest winner there ACTUALLY IS no benefit
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:22 because someone decided to stop giving away roles specifically for the contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:33:40 
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 16:34:23 don't think he even took part in one

plane-crazy 2019-09-03 21:17:49 and winter wheels

plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:47:21 not the mod's
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 15:48:04 as a mod you are not supposed to give exceptions to someone who has mental issues

creations-chat 2019-10-24 18:40:11 fuckin knew someone would make a rotodyne after mustard's video dropped
creations-chat 2019-10-24 18:42:11 if you ctrl+f rotodyne, all results are from today
creations-chat 2019-10-24 18:42:14 thonk

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 18:46:22 hMM
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 18:55:13 robo dies ??!!?? 😱

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 19:36:54 ok
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 04:41:16 not very surprising
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 04:41:38 same thing happened when mustard uploaded the 747 AAC video
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 13:42:43 hmmm yes balljoint

plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:29:35 yes we know literally everyone here watched that one video from mustard
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:31:02 also the rotodyne that one guy made in <#384025409945337856> would work like the real one if he only added jet engines at the tips of the main blade
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:31:09 probably maybe
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:31:43 no it has jets on the rotor tips
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:31:47 that's how it takes off
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:31:50 yes i know
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:32:01 you just throttle off the jets after takeoff
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:33:28 hey it's that manufacturer who made that one dorito plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 14:34:08 b

plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:01:56 there's no way you can get away without even a little bit of a gap
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:02:24 also robo did you get reaction perms for <#621452102618578964> already

plane-crazy 2019-10-31 15:00:54 ok unfortunately i know the name of that skin
plane-crazy 2019-10-31 15:01:07 not because i play the game though
creations-chat 2019-10-31 15:02:53 AA but doesn't even have a turret
creations-chat 2019-10-31 15:02:56 hmm yes
general 2019-10-31 17:49:11 because it is
general 2019-10-31 17:49:21 the build itself is infact low effort
general 2019-10-31 17:49:34 people are only upvoting because you made it a gif
general 2019-10-31 17:49:42 which is bullshit
general 2019-10-31 17:50:14 this is a contest of who has the best BUILD not who can make a gif with a pixelart
general 2019-10-31 17:50:39 also LMAO PEOPLE UPVOTE BECAUSE ITS ORIGINAL

general 2019-10-31 17:51:31 you spent all you effort outside the game
general 2019-10-31 17:51:49 which is not how contests are supposed to work
general 2019-10-31 17:52:41 making pixelart is not effort bruh moment
general 2019-10-31 17:53:08 because literally all pixelart is just people copying shit into pc
general 2019-10-31 17:53:18 oh wow that's epic right there
general 2019-10-31 17:54:01 it's not a test of effort, it's a test of how much free time you have
general 2019-10-31 17:54:19 don't have to make one to criticize you
general 2019-10-31 17:55:08 <@!340543153922768906> would say otherwise

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:15:32 ah yes, mods
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:15:48 the best judges when it comes to build quality
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:16:06 because the majority don't even play the gmae
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 16:16:10 game*

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 17:57:28 never had that happen
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 17:57:31 bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 17:57:39 even with my trusty dual core
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 18:04:28 looks like it has virtually no ground clearance
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:43:14 who told you that
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:43:19 just curious
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:43:49 usually people call this community toxic because people weren't satisfied with their build
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:44:11 so when someone tries giving constructive criticism they take it as an insult
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:58:56 vipgeneral used to be super gamers hangout but it isn't anymore
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 19:58:59 because contests
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:14:28 what no it isn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:14:35 he never said it walks
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:14:39 because it doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:14:56 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:14:56 average disabled walker
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:15:36 sometimes function can overweigh looks
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:15:41 but very rarely
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:15:58 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:16:50 bad sense of humor = 125025198360725324e+16 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:17:10 guys it's a brick oh my god
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:17:11 please laugh
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:18:45 if you have good build quality + somewhat of a joke behind it you get hella upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:18:53 hence why the funny tank picture has 85
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:19:20 actually what
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:19:25 that makes no sense but ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:19:41 are you saying that people get bored of good builds?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:19:56 brurburbrurburburh
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:20:36 it's called "this server has lots of people who can't even get close to what you built so they see it as very good"
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:21:36 it seems like people don't actually give a shit about physical build quality
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:21:44 if what they're looking at looks good
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:21:47 they upvote
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:21:57 hence why the skeleton gif got 80 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:23:00 the skeleton gif?
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:23:03 that's not original
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:24:20 people were talking about making an expert only creations chat
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:24:27 but that never really got off the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:26:00 anti you care more about the topic than the guy who got copied from does
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:26:19 ok
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:31:27 build a brick and submit it for 86 upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:32:01 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:32:19 
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 20:32:55 he tried milking it for more upvotes but it didn't quite work
general 2019-11-01 20:52:12 yes
general 2019-11-01 20:52:18 why not just rename it to general again
general 2019-11-01 20:52:25 and <#497142796961054721> to off topic
general 2019-11-01 20:52:28 might as well
general 2019-11-01 20:53:12 this server doesn't have enough (or any lol) active mods to make sure that <#384021699466756107> stays true to it's name
general 2019-11-01 20:53:20 so it's just used as a general chat
general 2019-11-01 20:53:36 it's also shitposting when they are online
general 2019-11-01 20:53:57 yes that's the state of this server right now
general 2019-11-01 20:54:03 very self aware
general 2019-11-01 20:54:26 uh
general 2019-11-01 20:54:26 was it that guy

plane-crazy 2019-11-01 22:19:52 <@!318892614378061824> you know he's talking about a server like the ones in <#617941134605549579> right
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 22:20:02 not an actual vip server for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-11-01 22:50:53 isn't that a little late

plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:03:07 probably
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:03:14 with co op story mode
plane-crazy 2019-11-03 10:03:49 spending full price on the same game but with slightly more content

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:18:22 and it doesn't really look like one
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:18:32 looks much more like a ladder
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:19:13 make it si that there's a bar every few blocks
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:19:23 not every single one
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:19:36 and try making the sides look thinner
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:20:41 make the rack wider by one and have half wedges instead of half blocks
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 19:20:56 one on each side*
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:07:32 <#384025409945337856> it's pinned

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:22:27 no they don't
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:22:48 it's been proven multiple times that rope treads are inferior to motor treads
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:22:59 + motor treads are more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:23:27 yes and so is steering with ropes
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:23:32 what's your point
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:23:39 bruh

plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:24:38 you really don't <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:25:17 if you know what you're doing, even a little bit, you can make working motor treads pretty easily
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:25:41 the only thing that's annoying about them is that it takes time
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:25:54 and even then it doesn't take that much time
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:26:22 he is wrong
plane-crazy 2019-11-06 19:26:30 it exists, he just can't see it

creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:10:27 some relatively small builds can dwarf even folding creations when it comes down to build quality
creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:11:56 it's not an option though
creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:12:07 it's an actual fact
creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:12:26 some folding carriers look like actual bricks
creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:13:13 if you think your carrier looks like a grey block of cheese you should probably start smaller

general 2019-11-19 16:14:14 if what you're saying is true and you did built it yourself, the other person is probably blind and can't differentiate between it and a tutorial
general 2019-11-19 16:14:28 if it annoys you that much you can either mute them or join another server
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 16:38:58 welcome to roblox

plane-crazy 2019-11-20 13:36:25 that's cool but like
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 13:36:27 who asked for this
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 13:37:02 that'd work like shit
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 13:37:05 and LOOK like shit
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 13:37:44 yes let me add a block that requires (probably) a hefty amount of scripting (maybe) but not add something that literally everyone wants
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:06:21 it's not the test server
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:06:30 it clearly says "earliest version of plane crazy."
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:06:43 lego couldn't
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:38:17 you were already able to make conveyors but ight
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:38:29 i thought a 145 iq man would know

plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:38:47 did something wrong then
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:39:02 didn't say you did
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:46:28 using it for tank tracks is also pretty fucking shit
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 14:46:54 you probably won't have such a wide range of speed for it as well
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 15:35:31 welcome to the internet
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 15:40:58 he's pretty much begging people to go vote for builds that aren't even his

plane-crazy 2019-11-20 18:29:46 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:16:45 using coveyors as tank treads is just one step above solid block treads
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:16:57 also their max speed is probably slow as shit
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:17:29 nobody said that this one will though
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:17:43 or just make real treads
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:17:47 which will
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:17:51 look better
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:17:55 and be more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:18:12 the entire point of a MK IV is the treads
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:18:23 one of the first tanks ever
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:18:28 and no real treads

plane-crazy 2019-11-28 18:03:35 oh i get what it does
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 18:04:16 so basically, with the old anchor block, when you anchor at high speed, every mechanical part(like motors and suspension) would fuck off into another dimension
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 18:04:23 with physics enabled it just stops dead
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 18:04:43 i wasn't talking about what you sent

creations-chat 2019-12-02 22:11:37 bruh lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:21:42 it's not a fact
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:21:43 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:21:58 people don't vote for size
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:00 they vote for looks
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:25 example
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:31 not proven lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:45 46 downvoted because the tanks look bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:55 look at what i just posted
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:22:58 not a single downvote
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:23:49 look at the fucking koenigsegg i just sent bruh

plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:24:08 peope vote if it looks GOOD
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:24:15 not if it's big
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:24:24 therefore your argument about size is invalid
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:00 because it looks bad bro
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:06 sorry but it does

plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:15 i'm saying that objectively
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:22 i don't need to make a better one to make a point
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:34 if you can't accept my opinion that's just being ignorant then
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:25:36 lmao ok

plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:28:19 told you that the front angle is bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:28:32 treads look like they're just a part of the hull
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:28:56 honestly it just looks more like this
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 22:29:53 the one from the pic kinda was

plane-crazy 2019-12-03 06:56:00 my churchill also used 100 yesterday when it laged like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 06:56:04 also bruh what
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 06:56:20 why do you need so many motors just to fold
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 06:56:39 but it's just a. 2 fold
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 06:56:45 180

plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:06:39 but that's no cool
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:07:24 just place a motor on the anchor block

plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:07:38 ok
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:08:17 pretty sure that's how it is with physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:08:32 if you anchor at speed everything stops DEAD
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:08:56 tried it with my car and it just stopped, suspension was still able to move though
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:09:52 just don't use physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 07:10:13 <@456226577798135808> bruh

plane-crazy 2019-12-03 13:19:42 you can't get more
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 13:19:56 you can however optimize builds so they take less data

plane-crazy 2019-12-09 19:22:06 there's a point where you can tell someone is saying something so that people screenshot it for no context funny and that makes it extremely unfunny
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 19:28:56 i keep alt tabbing when the cringe reaches max

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 07:07:30 fabric has most friction, ice has the least
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 07:07:39 i think metal is the heaviest

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 15:43:42 bruh that's why you were blacklisted?

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:57:06 and it broke literally everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:57:16 new script applies at over 100 torque
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:57:25 that's why motor2s usually work only under 100
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:57:41 yes that was with the old script
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:58:48 there wasn't a single time where i used the new script and it worked
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:58:56 worked as in didn't fling me to outer space
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 16:59:05 no idea lmao

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 17:03:33 the block that serves literally no purpose but lagging/glitching others
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 17:59:59 finally we're getting fireworks
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:00:15 been waiting an entire year for this

plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:32:46 if that were creativ you'd be muted, warned and permabanned simultaneously lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:33:27 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:33:35 finally a mod with some logic

plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:43:19 it's provided by roblox
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:43:37 it's not like he can just turn a slider and you'll have infinite
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:43:55 he can however compress builds so they take up less data
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:44:09 which is what he's been doing the past couple of months
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:44:36 there was also that supercompressor mad was working on but apparently it's not working well
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 06:44:39 and idk lol

plane-crazy 2019-12-15 16:13:50 especially since they don't lag and i do
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 16:14:43 small jets are probably much more agile
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 16:15:01 unless i make the plane entirely out of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 16:15:39 no just regular ones

general 2019-12-22 18:11:05 so whatevers attached to it moves by half a block
general 2019-12-22 18:11:43 if you want to use that glitch to your advantage, you build the canard one block out of where it's supposed to be
general 2019-12-22 18:11:54 and attach it to 2 locked motors

general 2019-12-25 20:02:02 alright nice
general 2019-12-25 20:04:05 ngl but he's right
general 2019-12-25 20:04:30 that's an awful lot of time to ban someone who's literally asking for it
general 2019-12-25 20:04:55 nvm he just got it
general 2019-12-25 20:05:20 now he's gonna rejoin with an alt though
general 2019-12-25 20:05:21 soo
general 2019-12-25 20:06:16 some people are so sad they enjoy joining servers to try and get banned
general 2019-12-25 20:06:28 this says a lot about our society
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:07:38 wow epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:08:10 what does "as roblox studio just errors" mean

plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:20:07 wanted to get banned anyway
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:20:12 big funny man
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:21:06 <#495286269459300364>

plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:26:23 you were able to get it for reacting to something
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:26:30 it's been deleted though
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:26:42 this role literally has no purpose now
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:37:26 since when was bypassing ingame filter against the rules
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:37:44 we don't enforce roblox rules
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 20:37:50 that's roblox's job

plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:07:51 hol up
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:07:59 wasn't that jetpack modeled specifically for pc?
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:08:09 so he just ripped it and used it in arctic base
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:08:11 epical
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:10:52 why does arctic base need a jetpack anyway
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 22:11:10 understandable
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:10:48 not really clapped
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:10:53 that's pretty average
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:11:14 yes i KNOW what it means
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:12:47 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/602079832678858762/635171444523008030/unknown.png?width=1051&height=657 this is what you call clapped
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:13:10 yes i play box
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:15:04 so close to what
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:15:22 if that gets put in hof i will seriously consider leaving
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:15:50 yes but not a fucking elon musk one
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:15:58 which probably took 40 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:16:18 why the hell is it still there
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:16:20 honestly
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:16:42 epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:18:10 that pixelart was added to hof because creativ thought it was "so fucking good"
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:18:22 even though im pretty sure all mods are supposed to discuss it
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:19:40 
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:20:27 also <@!296280922771292170> pretty sure he has enough """experience"""
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:20:35 but one thing he does not have is human logic
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:25:01 he won't
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:25:10 mainly because she has no intentions of returning
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:25:14 (i hope)
plane-crazy 2019-12-25 23:25:27 good
plane-crazy 2019-12-26 00:08:26 ok

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:24:30 mfw someone says the aventador svj looks good
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:26:33 brih are you talking about that

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:26:38 ok battle

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:28:49 ```looks like a chinese sumo went to an auto show and saw the egoista and tried to recreate it

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:02 even has a jet fighter inspired cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:06 just like the ego
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:27 it doesn't need to
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:31 v10 sounds better
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:51 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:29:54 pro

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:31:20

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 01:34:43 buying a one-off car barely known by 0.2 people isn't a very good way to flex

plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:48:46 this server is partnered bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 21:48:52 pretty sure it's official
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:31:23 welcome to pcc stridel
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:32:33 not even bias, it's just that none of the higher ups give a shit
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:32:39 so everyone is free to do whatever
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:33:22 mods are setting an example of exactly what not to do
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:33:24 hmm yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:41:06 the only "stuff" he does is warn people with 0 reason
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:41:12 not really good
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:41:48 yes the perspective of someone who's out of his mind
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:42:10 he warned someone from putting reactions in <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:42:15 no
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:42:30 honestly jail is doing a better job
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:42:40 because he isn't warning with such shit reason
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:43:00 doesn't matter if he tires
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:43:03 still a bad mod
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:43:34 definitely just as bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:43:36 if not worse
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:43:55 activity doesn't mean good mod
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:44:03 take blackbird for example
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:44:11 was active as shit but also did nothing
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:44:42 having shitty ass logs like warning people for spamming reactions is worse than having none
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:45:06 but no one ever checks a mod's logs
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:45:10 so he can get away with it
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:45:16 and so here we are
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:45:31 yeah not gonna happen
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:45:37 what admins lmao

plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:48:02 yeah you're not making a t71 turret in pc
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:48:07 just no
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:48:45 you think i want to be a mod for this shithole
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:48:48 i don't
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:49:54 <@!296280922771292170> a good mod is someone who actually checks chat once in a while, follows the rules they were supposed to enforce and use logic
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:50:33 because lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:50:54 only hyper has the possibility of being a good mod
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:51:06 and vip was pretty good as well but vox had 0 sense of humor moment
plane-crazy 2019-12-28 23:51:31 also robo what about the fucking buggy

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 00:03:07 probably because it's another server
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 00:12:08 what does boosting have to do with anything
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 00:12:18 it's not going to die if no one boosts
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 00:12:28 wat

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 07:24:15 do you think vox gives a shit lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 07:24:18 he doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 07:30:14 imagine needing a 3rd party software to run another OS
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 07:30:20 this meme was made by win10 sandbox gang

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:19:58 wat
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:20:16 never happened to me but ok
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:20:24 nah
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:20:53 this is using a motrlock glitch bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:21:01 it's physically a part of the vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:21:05 it's not unwelded
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:21:47 if you used suspension and ropes it wouldn't phase through blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:22:01 bruh have you like

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:22:57 it's all considered one part
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:23:00 it's LOCKED
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:24:02 ofc suspension will lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:24:04 dumb moment
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:28:36 good
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:33:03 because normal spring works like shit
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:33:18 and it also sticks if you compress it too hard
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:33:21 on rough landings
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:34:07 super simple
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:34:10 and it works very well
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:35:33 have you ever tried landing a drop higher than 2 studs
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:35:38 it just sticks to the upper bit
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:36:02 must be bouncy as fuck then
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:36:08 with that much stiffness
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:36:26 i know what damping is
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:37:08 most people can't even build a proper solid axle
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 11:37:57 ok

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:08:15 
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:08:18 they're much longer and don't curve in like yours does
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:08:41 aight
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:35 you want to use pistons as hydraulics?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:00 they probably won't work that well to be honest
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:10 especially when working with heavy loads

general 2020-01-05 15:04:35 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:07:27 what's the torque setting for the motor?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:08:23 probably
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:08:52 setting it above 100 torque will make the motor use a different script
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:09:00 try 99 or 1000
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:25 and what about 1000?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:40 do you have 2 motors on the turret?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:48 as in one for rotation and one for gun elevation
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:10:53 are they both set to 99?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:11:00 huh
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:11:18 after setting it to 99 it worked just fine for me
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:11:31 try replacing them with normal motors for a second and see if it still flings
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 15:14:15 might be

plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:35:44 it's not that hard
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:39:55 no it wasn't
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:40:00 you could barely see
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:40:08 especially if you were inside something
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:40:43 sorry but if you thought the no outline update was good, you're not a very experienced builder
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:41:05 literally everyone with a positive iq could see how that was a bad update
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:41:09 yeah really
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:41:31 hm yes goista
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:42:25 gonna assume you haven't seen it for yourself
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:42:52 ask every reputable builder here
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:43:00 and theyll tell you the update sucked
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:43:05 and probably not
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:43:30 both maps in <#621452102618578964> are likely not being added
plane-crazy 2020-01-06 10:43:56 and i know something about the progress of the map update but im not allowed to tell
general 2020-01-06 11:55:00 <@!217336009455566848> whoever boosted ran out of boosts
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:24:29 your observations are wrong then
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:25:08 people don't downvote because the build is (x), they downvote because it looks shit (in 99%) of cases
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:25:43 tired of people who think they get downvoted because of what their build is supposed to be
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:27:52 i can promise you that they weren't upvoted BECAUSE they're german
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:28:05 that's not how it works
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:31:43 someone thought it looks good, so he upvoted
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:31:50 that's all there is to it
creations-chat 2020-01-06 12:32:19 if you see a downvote, it probably means that someone doesn't like it
general 2020-01-06 12:47:08 they dislike them
general 2020-01-06 12:47:13 because they look bad
general 2020-01-06 12:47:37 you literally haven't seen good builds then
general 2020-01-06 12:48:23 how come you think these deserve upvotes
general 2020-01-06 12:48:54 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-01-06 12:49:14 any reason why you think that?
general 2020-01-06 12:50:13 h no not this argument
general 2020-01-06 12:50:19 anything but this argument
general 2020-01-06 12:50:22 for fucks sake
general 2020-01-06 12:50:47 you do realize that lots of battleships get downvotes
general 2020-01-06 12:50:52 and so do jet fighters
general 2020-01-06 12:51:00 and every other build
general 2020-01-06 12:51:20 it does not matter WHAT it is, what matters is if they look good
general 2020-01-06 12:51:28 if you can't realize that
general 2020-01-06 12:51:32 that's kinda sad

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 10:19:35 ```In ROBLOX, one real-world meter is 20 studs. ```
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 10:20:16 comparing robloxians to real humans is dumb

general 2020-01-12 20:32:43 it's the military group meme where someone tells a guy to change their skin color
general 2020-01-12 20:32:54 even though it's been posted here like 236743745 times already
general 2020-01-12 20:33:10 ok

creations-chat 2020-01-13 06:25:29 using text for a reticle wasn't his idea
creations-chat 2020-01-13 06:25:44 people thought of it the second signs were released on the test server
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 06:26:21 have you never seen an an225 before
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 06:27:06 maybe the largest plane in the world? idk
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 06:29:20 yielding do you understand what a cargo plane is
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 06:30:06 you know being the largest plane in the world and having like 650ton takeoff weight i think that amount of wheels is justified
plane-crazy 2020-01-13 06:30:31 ok i was 10 off
creations-chat 2020-01-13 10:42:53 not the gulf livery but ok
general 2020-01-13 11:10:19 do you know the "change your skin color" military group meme
general 2020-01-13 11:10:41 he posted that and creativ warned him for racism
general 2020-01-13 11:10:54 yes
general 2020-01-13 11:11:21 general looks at soldier and says "you, change your skin color"
general 2020-01-13 11:11:25 that picture
general 2020-01-13 11:11:58 anyway that led to him banned despite the fact that this meme has been posted here at least 16 times

plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:04:38 pretty sure that 5x5s are the worst water prop
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:04:51 too heavy and too little thrust
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:05:19 yeah 3x3s are ight

plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:26 what about putting one in the front, one in the back
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:06:58 oh
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:08:13 well you can either shove a super rocket wherever you can or make a compromise in the bomb bay to fit a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:10:51 if you get the placement right it should handle like it's on rails
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:10:58 so you can do this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/655344880633118722/2019-12-14_11-45-54.mp4

plane-crazy 2020-01-14 08:26:31 that's why we went from 20 something to 12

general 2020-01-15 07:53:55 deci want to see a funny picture
general 2020-01-15 07:54:40 ok guess not
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 07:56:49 why
general 2020-01-15 08:04:11 vipempire just sounds like a cooler name
general 2020-01-15 08:04:15 so i changed it
general 2020-01-15 08:05:02 huh idk
general 2020-01-15 09:14:43 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:40:33 press one
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:40:42 if you've already clicked on it
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:41:19 pretty sure he's talking about the camera block
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:41:58 so your problem is the camera angles itself towards something after configuring it
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:42:20 just press 1 or 2 so that it backs out of that menu
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:42:30 that's what i do anyway
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:42:49 click anywhere where there isn't a block
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 10:42:58 and then switch menus
general 2020-01-15 10:59:01 hold w and then press / once and then go eat something simulator 2020
general 2020-01-15 11:04:05 in games like desert bus you have to make corrections the entire way to not go off the road
general 2020-01-15 11:04:16 in here you just lock the w key and go do something else
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 13:44:44 why is it so shaky
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 13:45:08 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 14:12:10 cvt
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 14:16:26 wat
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 14:54:15 if you play this game to please other people that's not a very good reason
general 2020-01-15 14:55:29 could very well be, try searching there
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 15:04:12 that's not how it goes
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 15:04:20 it's why are we **still** here
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 15:05:37 i can but why
plane-crazy 2020-01-15 15:05:54 might as well replicate a real f1 style car
general 2020-01-15 16:45:46 it makes it so every time you boot discord an anime girl shouts "discord" and totally doesn't get annoying

general 2020-01-16 09:31:19 no one forced you to upgrade to win10 though wat

general 2020-01-16 09:38:17 there's a command you can run in cmd that deletes all bloatware that comes with win10
general 2020-01-16 09:38:33 and even if you don't want to do that, it takes about 20 seconds to manually remove it
general 2020-01-16 09:39:02 ok
general 2020-01-16 09:39:13 
general 2020-01-16 09:40:04 whatever, it still removes the bloatware

general 2020-01-31 10:23:02 what
general 2020-01-31 10:23:15 the fact that there was a contest for only group builds

plane-crazy 2020-02-16 22:19:21 that's what im saying
plane-crazy 2020-02-16 22:20:34 that's like saying a pfp of a fully dressed adult movie actor is inappropriate

plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:17:26 accusing everyone of using tutorials when you have no right to do so since you did use a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:17:31 logic?
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:17:57 it's your build but it's not your design
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:18:08 if you built a lego by the manual it doesn't mean you designed it
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:18:39 god this guy is a fucking cretin
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:18:57 (x) doubt

plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:20:52 who cares
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:20:55 it's still a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:21:01 that you spent no time thinking up
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:22:07 it doesn't even look that good tbh
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:22:10 LMAO
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:23:05 spending 3 hours copying a build when you can spend them gaining experience in the game and building something yourself
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:23:07 that's a bit sad
plane-crazy 2020-02-17 16:23:34 prove it lmao

plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:07:40 what's cursed is the width of the hull compared to the length of it
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:11:48 crispy image quality
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:14:50 lag machines cause the game engine to have a hard time
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:14:52 not your pc

plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:17:10 MUCH wider
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:18:35 why is the screenshot quality so low though
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:19:08 too wide/too short
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 06:19:15 either way it's disproportionate
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:19:40 oh nvm
creations-chat 2020-02-18 06:19:45 took a while to load
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 14:11:01 what

plane-crazy 2020-02-18 14:11:41 infinity - a number beyond one's counting ability > nan - not a number
creations-chat 2020-02-18 14:13:07 he posted this tank only twice, today and yesterday
creations-chat 2020-02-18 14:13:11 what a bruh moment this is
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 19:44:56 the red undo button on the save slot
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 19:47:55 it only restores a save if you hadn't left the game before saving
plane-crazy 2020-02-18 19:47:58 if you did, it's gone
creations-chat 2020-02-18 20:34:44 alright except for the fact that you're about to be annihilated by the tail
general 2020-02-18 22:32:29 you know i just checked your history, and i can't seem to find any of those so called great builds
general 2020-02-18 22:35:09 damn he just got owned

the-dump 2020-02-18 22:35:49 you can't
the-dump 2020-02-18 22:36:06 mobile ver is shit though lol
the-dump 2020-02-18 23:11:09 spending money on a mobile game is already a bruh
the-dump 2020-02-18 23:11:39 and a port of a game version from 2012 which isn't updated anymore is even worse
creations-chat 2020-02-19 07:33:49 not only are you reposting that dc3 for the fifth time, you did it just an hour after reposting it for the fourth time
creations-chat 2020-02-19 07:34:22 you don't have to repost every time you change a block on it, just build it completely and post it once, jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 14:15:57 shitposting in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 14:16:00 a classic move
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 14:16:14 i said it first
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 14:16:15 owned
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 14:16:39 you said you'd say it but you didn't

general 2020-02-19 16:25:19 are you sure about that
general 2020-02-19 16:29:03 it's impossible to build something that looks good at 1:1 scale unless it's massive in reality
general 2020-02-19 16:36:02 someone did build a mobile crane but it's upscaled
plane-crazy 2020-02-19 17:33:31 are any of these actually linked with eacother?

general 2020-02-20 15:26:38 there are articles saying don't say "ok boomer" becasue it's mean towards boomers
general 2020-02-20 15:27:15 god's sake

creations-chat 2020-02-21 15:17:04 the only people with mod permissions in the game are the ones in the game's description
creations-chat 2020-02-21 15:17:09 anyone else is bullshitting

plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:19:53 it looks like a delo but it's disproportionate as hell
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:20:09 and it rides way too high compared to the real one
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:20:33 my cars steer but are very low
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:20:52 having low ride height doesn't mean that you can't have steering
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:21:57 child's play
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:22:12 i have a stratotanker that can do 180 in about a second
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 17:35:45 don't mean to take the wind out of your sails but adding thrusters on the barrels of guns isn't exactly ingenious
plane-crazy 2020-02-21 20:10:34 except for the fact that they look better and are a big part of tracked vehicles
creations-chat 2020-02-21 20:23:54 funny man posted an unrelated picture

plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:58:51 brings everything attached to it a half block backwards
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:59:06 and it's the farthest from glitching out you could ever get
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:59:46 make the motor not move as a result of outside force
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:59:55 if it gets hit by something, it doesn't move
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 14:00:10 and it worked until he changed it about 5 months ago

general 2020-02-22 16:34:57 in other games you actually have gameplay
general 2020-02-22 16:35:10 and don't spend 90% of the game in menus

creations-chat 2020-02-22 21:43:52 just build it fully and post it once
creations-chat 2020-02-22 22:07:02 good lord that chiron
general 2020-02-23 07:20:17 did you censor it for privacy because it won't take long for someone to find that exact area lol
general 2020-02-23 07:22:58 that was hard wasn't it
general 2020-02-23 13:06:23 oohh he left?

general 2020-02-23 13:08:04 he'll rejoin within a week
general 2020-02-23 13:08:38 we will
general 2020-02-23 14:30:23 if a bot is offline it's just dead, it doesn't respond
general 2020-02-23 14:30:25 so you are fake
general 2020-02-23 14:30:28 owned rekt...
general 2020-02-23 14:32:19 it doesn't run into anything
general 2020-02-23 14:32:23 the code isn't running
general 2020-02-23 14:38:49 win95lover
general 2020-02-23 14:38:52 what a name
general 2020-02-23 14:40:41 you can also just check mutual servers
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 16:56:50 no upvotes vs 51
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 16:56:52 damn
general 2020-02-23 17:21:29 event where ou deltr servre
general 2020-02-23 17:21:52 ok
general 2020-02-23 17:22:00 so are you doign it
general 2020-02-23 17:22:12 nice
general 2020-02-23 17:22:29 see with no server you wouldn't have to do anything more to improve it
general 2020-02-23 17:25:07 stop displaying nitro boosts in <#490306593242611742> when in reality like 3 people care about them
general 2020-02-23 17:25:51 how's that working out for this server lmAO
general 2020-02-23 17:26:02 fat ass grand total of 7 boosts
general 2020-02-23 17:26:26 probably less because some have nitro
general 2020-02-23 17:26:30 so it's 2 boosts
general 2020-02-23 17:29:04 same here
general 2020-02-23 17:31:58 delete <#623337136267067393> because it's literally useless
general 2020-02-23 17:32:54 do you ever check that channel lol
general 2020-02-23 17:33:02 damn aight
general 2020-02-23 17:33:36 
general 2020-02-23 17:33:44 had it on mute basically since it's creation
creations-chat 2020-02-23 17:34:21 how many times are you going to post this thing
general 2020-02-23 17:35:40 no that's good
general 2020-02-23 17:35:50 because many people just barge in and ask that
general 2020-02-23 17:36:11 it only becomes annoying when someone starts spamming it
general 2020-02-23 17:36:26 at which case you can probably add a cooldown or something
general 2020-02-23 17:36:54 wasn't that a thing already lol
general 2020-02-23 17:37:04 no wait that was beginners guide
creations-chat 2020-02-23 17:37:36 <#384021699466756107> or <#478584971670454284> exist
general 2020-02-23 17:37:58 it had info on every block and simple game mechanics iirc
general 2020-02-23 17:38:05 i guess you can do one for the discord yeah
general 2020-02-23 17:38:41 actual mod team purge <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-02-23 17:39:43 get an expert rank
general 2020-02-23 17:40:31 you can but who's that sad of a human being to do that
general 2020-02-23 17:40:52 they aren't but you can easily slip them in unnoticed
general 2020-02-23 17:41:08 or
general 2020-02-23 17:41:13 you just build good
general 2020-02-23 17:42:24 restrict vip server access to experts only
general 2020-02-23 17:42:30 and the ability to suggest
general 2020-02-23 17:42:47 ew because you can't build and therefore don't have sufficient ranks?
general 2020-02-23 17:42:48 yes ew
general 2020-02-23 17:43:25 do you remember how we had that one guy who kept joining for a week and harassed people
general 2020-02-23 17:43:33 and it took hours of spamming rick to get him to give a shit
general 2020-02-23 17:44:00 iv is better yes
general 2020-02-23 17:44:55 it's not that hard to get an iv rank bruh
general 2020-02-23 17:45:22 not really no
general 2020-02-23 17:45:43 bruh what
general 2020-02-23 17:45:46 what's the point of it then
general 2020-02-23 17:45:57 a reporting channel where people can't report
general 2020-02-23 17:46:00 w a t
general 2020-02-23 17:46:20 it's just going to become public mod shitposting 2.0
general 2020-02-23 17:46:30 or was it 3.0 i can't remember
general 2020-02-23 17:47:28 what is the point of that suggestion
general 2020-02-23 17:47:38 someone will just spam overwrite it like the funny man he is
general 2020-02-23 17:47:58 and even if he didn't why would you want something like that
general 2020-02-23 18:05:29 2 people boosted like 20 times each but their moms found the charges on their credit
general 2020-02-23 18:13:17 good times
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 18:26:20 what even is the point of that
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 18:26:42 "let us know what you think but even if you don't like it we'll do it anyway "
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 18:32:44 im not talking about the actual suggestion, im talking about that last sentence
general 2020-02-23 18:33:28 james are you saying that someone like jail should be admin
general 2020-02-23 18:33:35 he's been a mod for like a year
general 2020-02-23 18:35:20 it's not like you can do it anyway 😎
general 2020-02-23 18:45:49 what for
general 2020-02-23 18:46:57 can you upgrade to a plastic chair
general 2020-02-23 18:47:17 aww dait
general 2020-02-23 18:47:19 dammit
general 2020-02-23 18:47:49 how about a handcrafted wooden chair
general 2020-02-23 18:48:10 that's it, im sold
general 2020-02-23 19:04:41 imagine actually using the tesla in ud
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:08:28 
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:08:35 neither of which are related to the game's development
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:08:40 so what's the point
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:09:04 why not just say rick then
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:09:07 or a developer
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 19:09:12 and let him handle it
general 2020-02-23 19:24:07 read channel description

general 2020-02-23 21:27:27 half of the mod team which barely does anything
general 2020-02-23 21:27:37 so it doesn't really matter
general 2020-02-23 21:28:26 that's like breaking a concrete wall and claiming that you've destroyed a building the wall isn't structurally integral to
general 2020-02-23 21:29:18 who the fuck pays for primere <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

creations-chat 2020-02-24 21:03:59 the fact that they're fast and agile doesn't mean they were built for stunts though

creations-chat 2020-02-25 19:44:00 bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 20:20:57 he only stated about 5k times that the game is hardcoded and needs a rewrite for whitelisting to work
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:26:44 it was cancelled because the model was ugli
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:26:46 iirc
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:27:26 quantum physics suggest that this is simply impossible
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:28:48 it could but we'd be dead
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:33:23 have you received any good apps since last time
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:33:37 surprising, this is not

plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:50:02 we all know you're gay you don't have to pretend
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:50:06 it's all right
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 23:50:46 didn't do anything that we know of, yes
creations-chat 2020-02-26 00:03:25 that steering angle looks anything but realistic
general 2020-02-26 00:07:39 oh nice
general 2020-02-26 00:07:42 was waiting for that
general 2020-02-26 00:07:45 good man

general 2020-02-26 20:01:03 that's like lowering the horsepower of a car for balancing sake
general 2020-02-26 20:01:07 mega dumb
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:35:51 >  idk... seems like everyone downvotes everything...
when will people come to terms with the fact that some builds look bad and therefore will get downvoted
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:36:11 nobody downvotes builds for no reason
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:14 you can find the answer right in your question
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:17 > pixel art
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:42 and it's not subjectively cool, people who downvoted didn't think it was cool
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:17:56 most pixelarts are just copies from the internet which take little to no effort
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:18:02 and they're boring
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:18:16 so what
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:19:30 your definition of cool is not what other's is
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:19:57 the 3 other people who downvote it probably thought that pixelarts are lazy and unimaginative
creations-chat 2020-02-26 21:20:03 because they are

creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:39:27 if everyone thought that it was ok it would've gotten more upvotes

general 2020-03-06 14:11:54 if you want to then yes
general 2020-03-06 14:16:32 argue meant
general 2020-03-06 20:48:13 what the fuck hold on
general 2020-03-06 20:48:35 HE BEAT ME ON OKS
general 2020-03-06 20:48:57 this is unacceptable
general 2020-03-06 20:50:17 well at least i have the highest percentage
general 2020-03-06 20:50:51 uh
general 2020-03-06 20:51:39 it's 3.49%
general 2020-03-06 20:51:43 on the main channel
general 2020-03-06 20:52:39 3.78
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:13:43 is that based on pointman's a10
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:14:12 right
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:04 about 95% of the entire server
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:06 is my guess
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:30 that's true
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:37 but it's time you could use to make the pc version better
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:21:55 instead of wasting it on supporting a device 1 to 5 people will ever play
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:22:03 also that
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:22:17 it's just a general waste of time imo
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:22:26 ok
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:22:54 screenshots are good enough for me but alright
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:32:26 this man is beyond english
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:32:43 oh damn
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 21:32:55 he's probably ascended way past that already
general 2020-03-06 22:26:17 huh, i wonder why
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:27:22 sps is definitely not meters per second
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:27:26 it's STUDS per second
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:27:49 no it's not
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:27:52 who said that
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:28:37 400 sps is 72km/h
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:28:44 which is very far from supersonic
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:28:46 bruh moment
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:30:02 it's ok if you don't want to accept it, it's just a fact
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:32:41 so their units are wrong
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:32:42 yes
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:33:18 im going off a statement in a roblox blog which says that 20 studs is one meter
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:33:28 and therefore 400sps is 72km/h
creations-chat 2020-03-07 07:34:37 6,8k sps
general 2020-03-07 09:17:17 <#609442446249820211>
general 2020-03-07 09:18:03 you don't even need to try that hard to get an expert rank
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:18:17 water wheels
general 2020-03-07 18:11:12 you're asking that question despite looking at his name in the ping menu
general 2020-03-07 18:11:18 what a bruh moment this is
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:41:37 it's called higher standards lol
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:41:54 the game's evolved, the things you used to see here aren't considered good anymore
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:43:08 actually tiny blocks get deleted now because they're not even remotely funny
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:43:29 example https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/684472129751875705
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:43:47 yes
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:44:12 good builds still get the recognition they deserve though (mostly)
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:44:22 take that red car from a few days ago as an example
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:44:53 it's being voted on as we speak actually
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:44:57 prob going on hof tomorrow
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:45:17 saying WIP is just a cheap excuse as to why something isn't good on your build
general 2020-03-07 18:46:27 what the fuck this game still works?
general 2020-03-07 18:47:46 yes i know
general 2020-03-07 18:48:07 but the last time i tried it was literally unplayable
general 2020-03-07 18:48:12 nobody could spawn anything
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:27:38 upvotes don't matter at all lmao, rick just adds whatever he wants
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:27:49 you're better off asking a garbage truck to implement that feature
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:32:10 you're wrong, all we need is a mobile version that 2 people will ever play on
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:33:46 oh fuck yeah xb1 controls
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 20:33:49 can't wait for that

plane-crazy 2020-03-09 07:54:21 i remember playing the real pd2 two years ago
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 07:56:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 07:56:59 itasha is still bad

plane-crazy 2020-03-09 07:59:23 like an evo
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 08:01:46 bruh
general 2020-03-09 08:02:14 place where you could get a limited item
general 2020-03-09 08:02:20 but you can't anymore
general 2020-03-09 12:42:04 studs per second
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:02:42 bruh what
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:02:58 e+something just means that the number shown is too big
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:03:19 the number after the e is how much the decimal point moves
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:04:38 
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:04:54 e+16 means that you move the decimal point to the right 16 times
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:05:07 it's just a way to show very large numbers
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:05:48 we're not talking about the value of e bruh
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:06:42 ok what are you trying to say here
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:07:22 when they said e+ they meant a number like 1.523e+10
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:08:10 i do but it has no correlation to what we were talking about
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:11:43 
plane-crazy 2020-03-09 14:12:16 fastest i've seen was +18

general 2020-03-10 07:24:35 if you want to make something hover using the old way you still can
general 2020-03-10 08:30:10 inf
general 2020-03-10 08:37:12 you can still achieve stable straight line speed with conveyor/magnet drives
general 2020-03-10 08:37:30 and conv drives aren't buggy at all
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 10:43:13 update for what

plane-crazy 2020-03-10 18:07:06 maybe for you, but for most people it's self explanatory
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 18:08:08 what happened to the front portion of the skirt
creations-chat 2020-03-10 18:52:04 ``` If you downvote I bet you you fill your planes with rockets, what noobs!```
just read this line LMAO
creations-chat 2020-03-10 19:16:37 i got a 4.8k plane powered solely by custom props, it's not that hard
creations-chat 2020-03-10 19:17:04 but thinking you're a god just because you don't use rockets in the fuselage is quite the stupid moment
creations-chat 2020-03-10 19:18:49 or none, if you use a conveyor drive
general 2020-03-10 19:24:34 how come we got event hosts already but no mods
general 2020-03-10 19:24:40 isn't the application virtually the same?
general 2020-03-10 19:25:07 definitely not completely different lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:26:15 why are you surprised
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:26:26 it's the space update he suggested in <#507673335816126509> g

general 2020-03-10 19:43:24 he used water wheels as substitute for motors
general 2020-03-10 19:43:27 not very inventor
general 2020-03-10 19:43:47 motors
general 2020-03-10 19:44:01 you literally just jammed a wedge in the wheel and rotated it
general 2020-03-10 19:44:34 ok well get the gif of the mechanism and prove it
general 2020-03-10 19:45:42 
general 2020-03-10 19:45:53 you just jammed a wedge in the wheel for the elevation part
general 2020-03-10 19:46:07 big man
general 2020-03-10 19:46:07 ok where's he updated one then
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:49:00 don't use discord's message quotes
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:49:07 worst feature added in the last few months

general 2020-03-11 09:00:10 yes what about it
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 09:01:02 
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 09:01:17 plane curves inside, yours curves outside
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 09:05:17 should probably use blueprints if you're starting with an outline
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 09:05:22 and move to models afterwards
creations-chat 2020-03-11 10:40:48 how many times are you going to repost that
creations-chat 2020-03-11 10:43:35 ok
general 2020-03-11 11:48:24 ever heard of the "watch later" playlist?
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 11:59:54 ok but when are you going to add more useful blocks that literally everyone's been asking for
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:00:13 yes when
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:00:24 2057 on a good decade
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:01:36 wat
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:01:41 he was always this active
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:01:46 wasn't "suddenly"
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:01:59 yes he was
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 12:03:14 i've been in the server for a year and a few months and this is always how active he's been

plane-crazy 2020-03-11 16:01:52 you put it on a surface, not under it
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 16:01:57 and the conveyor should face down
plane-crazy 2020-03-11 16:06:10 np
creations-chat 2020-03-11 16:14:37 they build them in seprate sections and rotate it with motors
creations-chat 2020-03-11 16:15:06 that's why you see planes looking like spaghetti when they're not spawned

general 2020-03-11 19:25:46 some base model trucks cost way less
general 2020-03-11 19:25:49 as in 3 times less
general 2020-03-11 19:26:21 you'd survive a ram in a normal truck as well
general 2020-03-11 19:27:23 are you saying that you'd survive being rammed by a train in a cybertruck
general 2020-03-11 19:27:41 ok

general 2020-03-12 21:27:03 but it's made by microsoft
general 2020-03-12 21:28:48 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab it's this app

general 2020-03-12 22:37:57 pretty sure i know what you mean and if that's the case, you can infact use motorlock for it
general 2020-03-12 22:38:05 but if you don't want to that's fine too
general 2020-03-12 22:38:17 also puri that's a 2015 not 2013

plane-crazy 2020-03-12 22:52:44 it's an exploit
general 2020-03-12 23:10:23 so that you can get angry when they glitch out and gain altitude for no reason
general 2020-03-12 23:10:44 and despite being told multiple times, rick still hasn't fixed them
general 2020-03-13 08:13:05 why are you taking these downvotes personally
general 2020-03-13 08:13:17 it's simply because people didn't like your build
general 2020-03-13 08:13:36 what exactly made you think that it's """toxicity"""
general 2020-03-13 08:14:29 in your eyes it's good, in others it's not

general 2020-03-21 22:34:58 and also has the option to remove certain elements from a site (say you want to not see what people liked on your twitter feed)
general 2020-03-21 22:35:18 can't really think of a better example for the latter but yeah

general 2020-03-23 15:15:29 every time this guy says something it's wrong
general 2020-03-23 15:28:10 you're comparing a flamethrower made for war to a flamethrower made for civilians

plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:25:08 old as shit though
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:25:25 funny man
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:26:57 since you're asking for a tutorial, im assuming your experience is rather limited, so the one or two swashplate tutorials for this game won't really help you
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:27:16 so no, there isn't really a heli tutorial you'd want
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:30:31 there are lots of things it'd fit in but alright
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:30:46 don't use it if you're planning on making a tiny heli
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:31:38 you don't need a swashplate then
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:32:06 also robo im 6k away from chariot <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:32:19 yes
the-dump 2020-03-23 17:54:00 why don't you have adblock
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:57:03 you can mute engine sounds if you really want to
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:57:43 mutes everything
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:57:53 pretty sure there isn't a way to selectively mute parts

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:47:35 when the pic is older than the real tank
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:48:33 damn
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:54:39 2020 is finally here
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:56:21 doesn't really matter if we now have floating stairs
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:01:07 are you just gonna keep the sails folded
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:03:39 aight
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:07:57 you don't need pics
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:08:00 just look at it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:09:56 should be something like that
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:10:38 also why aren't you planning ahead for your builds, if a pivotal reference point for the build is missing, don't build it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:10:55 don't build them then lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:10:57 brh
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:11:57 not entirely sure about the 3rd from the back but yeah
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:02 lots of ships have that sail layout
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:50 where
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:12:55 also GOOD LORD that quality
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:13:24 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:13:42 uh
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:13:42 i remember my ship having the same radar location but i did manage to have a sail there
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:14:06 ok the radar was just placed way lower
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:14:10 which is not the case on yours
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:15:25 if this ship had better documentation you could find pic where the mounting points for the sails are
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:15:39 OR it'd actually have blueprints showing the sails l0l
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:16:11 neither was mine, only one was made
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:18:06 that seems easy as shit to do lol
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:18:17 just motor lock and something to hold it back
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:18:23 also why would he want to do that

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:21:06 trying to understand why there's only one boom
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:23:25 most likely

general 2020-03-24 15:41:43 hit like if you didn't know that until now
general 2020-03-24 15:44:01 which was just vip's 747 but not as good
general 2020-03-24 15:45:56 oh you're talking about that one
general 2020-03-24 15:46:13 im talking about the one where he copied vip's fuselage
general 2020-03-24 15:46:47 well in that case
general 2020-03-24 15:46:58 
general 2020-03-24 16:07:17 not full
general 2020-03-24 16:07:23 there's 9 in it right now
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 16:39:38 IM IN THE PICTURE
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:45:55 friction block is just a block with fabric material pre-applied to it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:04 no idea why he added it in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:19 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 17:46:46 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:16:09 motors
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:17:47 how does that make no sense
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:17:55 you literally use a motor to get an angle
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:37:25 you need one visually or functionally?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:37:56 don't really have one then, your only option is suspension
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:38:10 yes bruh but there isn't really anything else for absorbing shocks other than suspension
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:38:34 if you really want, you can experiment with hover thrusters, but i can't really guarantee it working
general 2020-03-24 18:51:28 
general 2020-03-24 18:51:54 uh
general 2020-03-24 18:52:43 the name is so fucking long so i don't know

general 2020-03-24 18:53:34 it's a live
general 2020-03-24 18:53:40 talking about mine
general 2020-03-24 18:54:33 i remember coming across lots of songs compressed into one and it reached like 1 hour and 5 minutes
general 2020-03-24 18:54:36 and yes bruh it's spotify
general 2020-03-24 18:54:54 bhr
general 2020-03-24 18:55:16 he doesn't listen to music
general 2020-03-24 18:55:19 he listens to mp4
general 2020-03-24 18:55:25 that's 150iq right there
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:58:39 guil, even if you make a model which is objectively better than the current one in every way, the dev won't use it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 18:59:07 someone suggested to make new wedge models so that all the dev would have to do is to put them in the game, and that suggestion was ignored/rejected
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:01:33 well damn alright then
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:02:17 well it didn't seem like he showed any interest in the wedge idea (from what i know of) so at least your case has progressed farther
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:05:07 yeah that happens
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:13:01 you need to plan WAAAAY ahead if you want sails
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:13:18 cause folding all of that will be a fat pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:13:55 what about the ones in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:14:27 aight
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:15:12 probably dark's supremacy
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 19:15:15 uh

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 20:37:52 like 5 beams i think?

plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:05:36 remove the entire steering rack and try again
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:08:47 bro what
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:08:57 why would you use toggle for turret controls
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:10:35 get a picture where i can see if the rack is hitting the main bar
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:16:09 bruh why do you have that setup on a tank
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:16:20 best setup would just be QA and AD
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:16:37 not WS and AD for one or two sets of wheels
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:17:58 what you have on your tank is one set of wheels for turning
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:18:05 and all the others are set to w and s
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:18:09 that's not very good
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:18:34 Q and A for all left wheels, E and D for all right wheels
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:18:45 and you alternate between them if you want to steer
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:21:04 if you set it right, it should be:
QE for forwards
AD for backwards
QD for rotating right
AE for rotating left
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:23:23 if that's confusing you're kinda small brain
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:23:34 aight np
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:23:56 it might not be but it's much more effective
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 18:24:08 you utilize all wheels at all time
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 20:04:04 in that case you can either:
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 20:04:14 -block the person
-leave and join another server
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 20:04:39 because most chances are nobody else will come and help you on that case since there's only one ingame mod and he won't help you at all
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 20:11:54 HOW
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 20:12:53 what makes you think that the decision is up to normal people

creations-chat 2020-04-02 03:10:16 personally i've been playing for over a year, and i know people who've been playing for a lot more
creations-chat 2020-04-02 03:11:52 alternatively you can try looking at other people's builds for inspiration (not copying obviously) and see how they deal with specific angles and shapes
creations-chat 2020-04-02 03:12:16 yeah i never said that i could directly make you build better

bot-central 2020-04-02 09:34:59 very nice
bot-central 2020-04-02 09:35:17 bro you could just automate contests like that
bot-central 2020-04-02 09:35:24 have it announce the top 3 and shit
bot-central 2020-04-02 09:35:38 maybe even award contest winner if the winner doesn't have it already
bot-central 2020-04-02 09:36:11 yes
bot-central 2020-04-02 09:36:37 when are you gonna start selling data
general 2020-04-02 09:51:47 damn
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:17:06 using suspension to stretch out the treads
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:17:09 not very good
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:19:46 define "die"
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:20:34 wheels spin and treads stay still?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:22:39 well the only contact the treads have with the wheels is with the motor's bases
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:22:42 and that's, really not much
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:22:54 like here
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:23:47 yeah there's nothing to really keep it in place
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:24:21 you need to have the middle cylinder sink into the tread
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:24:23 by half a block
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:24:38 that way it gets more friction, as well as locking the treads in place
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:25:22 not a very good picture but it's the only one i have atm
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:25:41 wheel is sunk into the tread, not staying over it
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:26:18 i think you can't really do something like that with the tread design you use
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:26:32 probably need to make a new one specifically for that to happen
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:39:04 not exactly what i had in mind but if it works that's good i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 10:57:44 nearly every tank has that but ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 14:49:28 if it was easy to do it would've been done already

creations-chat 2020-04-05 05:36:07 it's called a hatchback
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 08:22:32 fun fact literally everyone knows
general 2020-04-05 09:36:36 it's not even using the entire screen
general 2020-04-05 09:36:39 bruh?
general 2020-04-05 09:37:03 the game above
general 2020-04-05 09:37:22 certainly
general 2020-04-05 09:37:33 it looks like it was made for iphone 4
general 2020-04-05 10:37:16 1x2 half wedge exists but probably not in the form he's talking about
general 2020-04-05 10:37:29 what he means is like the half wedge in the normal wedges section
general 2020-04-05 10:37:39 which is a 1x2 half wedge with 2 half blocks below it
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 11:31:38 no rick, the shape he needs doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 11:31:42 when will you understand that
creations-chat 2020-04-05 11:59:27 the wheels
creations-chat 2020-04-05 12:00:32 you can make 4x4s yourself
creations-chat 2020-04-05 12:00:35 with half wedges
creations-chat 2020-04-05 12:00:52 they're nowhere nearly as smooth but they will fit that size of a car much better
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:09:27 > M104 Wolverine *Heavy Assault Bridge* in action.
have nearly the same thing but built a year ago https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/545391607457906706
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:10:53 incorrect, it's the 56th
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:11:00 nice guess, but you weren't quite there
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:12:01 no don't ban
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:12:18 if you ban i have 6k alts waiting on standby
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:12:23 they're already here
creations-chat 2020-04-05 13:13:38 don't try me
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 19:28:56 is that supposed to be a 234
plane-crazy 2020-04-05 20:19:17 the moment when you broke your ankles so you just used a hinge and screws to keep the legs intact
general 2020-04-06 15:00:04 how is that considered hypocritical?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:49:30 it's not bad at turning
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:49:33 where'd you get that from
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:49:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:49:47 it's not as good as most supercars but it's not bad like you say it is
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:50:00 it's heavy but it can handle it's wweight very well
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:50:10 comparing it to normal supercars is kinda dumb
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:50:17 because it was never meant to comete with them
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:50:19 and what
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:50:30 google exists <@!688873558746595453>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:51:07 wow who would've thought that a more luxury/grand tourer oriented car is worse than track focused supercars handling wise
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:51:54 no they're not
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:51:56 but ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:52:08 where'd you get that from exactly?
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:52:13 do you know what mid engine means
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:52:23 oh my fucking god

plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:53:14 but i never said anything about the 911 not being rear engined
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:55:21 <@!457211272908242945>
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:55:39 mid engine = engine between front and rear axle
rear engine = engine behind rear axle
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 15:55:45 moment when facts

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 18:42:58 built such big wheels only for it to not have suspension at all and no proper steering mechanism
general 2020-04-07 18:52:29 you're stopping 6 years too late
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 19:05:52 you build them
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 19:05:54 yourself

plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:05:35 there are lots of things that you could build and probably get modeler with
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:05:48 but if you're building something specifically for modeler, don't bother
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 19:05:56 and uhhhh i doubt it

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:22 you say you hate how people make "overscaled" builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:32 and then proceed to make an overscaled b2 with no detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:38 most of which was copied from puri lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:45 how
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:43:51 do you know how big an actual b2 is
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:44:39 ok so why is yours "overscaled" then
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:54 that's not what overscaled means
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:45:58 it means UPscaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:12 and so what if someone makes a thing upscaled
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:23 they get to pay more attention to small detail
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:46:56 are you saying it looks horrific because it's big or horrific because build quality sucks
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:47:01 WHAT

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:48:04 as long as it looks good and has detail, no one gives a single shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:49:07 that duck is fucking gigantic
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:49:12 it's the size of a robloxian
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:49:22 looks horrific
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 07:51:02 at least 7

plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:05:21 plus the requirement back then was only 30 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:05:26 and there wasn't a voting
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:05:30 and bruh it was a joke
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:05:39 if you couldn't tell
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:06:54 everything from here upwards didn't go through <#544722974574379021> for voting https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/685555689841885217
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:00 they only needed 40 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:07:07 so even that brick lookin truck got in
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:08:52 yes funny event china square type 59 funny square tiannamen funny china event funny
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:09:33 why would someone make that
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:10:01 that's more of a personal opinion
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 08:10:10 and im pretty sure others don't share that opinion
general 2020-04-14 09:30:24 i do but it's not just suspension slapped on the car
general 2020-04-14 09:30:44 o
general 2020-04-14 09:34:12 <@!582834773773254656>
general 2020-04-14 09:34:25 i use motors and wishbones to create suspension
general 2020-04-14 09:34:47 you just need to bring up a design from real life and replicate it
general 2020-04-14 09:35:13 
general 2020-04-14 09:35:27 right one is the one on my car
general 2020-04-14 09:36:50 smaller

bug-reports 2020-04-14 19:51:16 jetpack randomly drifts up (or sometimes down) without reason, when i leave the controls it just starts moving.
bug-reports 2020-04-14 19:51:24 no this isn't caused by lag because nothing is spawned and the server is brand new, this bug has been in the game for months now and it's really damn annoying to build like this
the-dump 2020-04-14 19:53:14 it takes about 5 minutes to make videos with this software
the-dump 2020-04-14 19:53:18 barely any time spent
creations-chat 2020-04-14 19:53:49 halo is still missing
general 2020-04-14 19:55:43 there's a way to do that by going to roblox studio's settings and changing stuff
general 2020-04-14 19:55:53 but it's not recommended for people who don't know what they're doing
general 2020-04-14 19:57:08 there probably is
general 2020-04-14 19:57:22 just google how to improve performance on roblox
general 2020-04-14 19:57:28 something along those lines
general 2020-04-14 19:58:09 you can and i did it
general 2020-04-14 19:58:17 i just don't remember exactly how

general 2020-04-14 20:56:06 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:43:47 whether your first build was good or not doesn't mean shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:43:54 what matters is how you are now
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:45:41 i can't judge based on the b2 because it looks like you just copied it from puri
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:46:28 i never said you did
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:46:38 notice how i said *looks like*
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 07:51:43

creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:26 > Also, couple ranked folks said small builds shouldn't be expected to get upvotes...
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:33 whoever said that is probably not very smart
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:41 because in the end size doesn't matter
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:45 if it looks good, it gets upvotes
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:17:14 you can have a giant build which looks ugly, it will get downvoted to hell
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:18:06 there's your other problem
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:18:28 if you want upvotes, all you need to take into account is this https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/699986580512702495

general 2020-04-15 18:16:12 good
general 2020-04-15 18:21:05 he downvoted the my truck because i said it uses the same suspension mechanism as the one irl
general 2020-04-15 18:22:52 skycraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:23:42 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:24:54 yes

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:29:47 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:30:29 there's like 300 motors in it, not including wheels and suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:30:33 and i dropped that long ago
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:35:58 bruh i was gonna say that
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:36:12 as the guy who built that car
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:36:15 it does
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:36:46 it just doesn't move
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:37:10 just saying nobody uses motor lock for its intended purpose
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:37:18 they use it for the things you've seen above
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:37:47 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:37:56 what
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:38:00 it just locks on it's own
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:38:13 when there's no input it stops moving
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:38:18 that's it

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:06:23 idk bro maybe roblox can't pay to renew the server
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:42:55 nice to see that people still wear that shirt
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:39 that question can be applied to literally anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:45 why build a car, why build a tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:46:49 why build a helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:47:41 are you implying that passenger jets aren't complicated
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:47:52 then what
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:50:49 they just used this
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:50:53 paint bucket for materials
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:50:55 b r u h
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:51:09 you can
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:51:42 i had a glass plane somewhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:51:49 gonna try to find a picture
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:53:25 ok i just checked
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:53:31 and he probably removed it
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 19:53:36 i swear you were able to do that
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 20:41:12 who
general 2020-04-15 21:03:26 who is that
general 2020-04-15 21:06:12 and the other guy?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:46:29 adding wedges is much easier than whatever the fuck he wants to add to the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:46:40 so "being busy" makes literally no sense
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:47:31 nothing new
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:54:15 zonda got 78 upvotes 😎
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:54:44 and piger is at 75
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:55:01 porsche tiger
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:55:03 piger
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:55:21 g
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:57:41 really doubt that any submarine will ever get hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:57:52 cause subs are really bland
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:59:00 because it's old as shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:59:25 and:
1) the requirement was only 30 upvotes back then
2)posts didn't go through <#544722974574379021> before going to hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 07:59:41 so at that time if you got 30+ upvotes you could get into hof just like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:00:31 fuck you mean why
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:00:35 do you know how old this build is
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:00:51 it's literally more than a year old
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:01:07 and at the time it was pretty much the best and biggest plane in the game
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:02:39 no they didn't
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:02:52 skill ceiling was way lower
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:11 the amount of blocks we had back then is nothing compared to now
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:15 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:03:24 this is such a bruh moment right now
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:04:18 there's a difference between deserve and eligible
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:04:45 most of the creations on the start of hof don't deserve to be there (opinion) but they met the requirements
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:04:59 also wat block limit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:05:32 i meant variations of wedges and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:06:04 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:07:24 when you don't know anything about the game's past and yet mock a 1 year old creation
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 08:07:26 <:Bruh:589676002221883403>

plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:46 that doesn't mean shit
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 09:50:57 people don't vote because whoever made it is popular

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:22:44 and then ask a mod when you get 40
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:23:14 yes what about it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:37:10 > the ranks are currently telling us that the only way to make a good build is making a big build, which I believe is totally incorrect.
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:37:23 that is completely incorrect, but you can keep thinking that way
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:37:59 i dare you to think with your brain for once
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:38:34 wow
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:38:37 you are a bigbrain
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:39:03 yeah ofc you need to pass a block limit for other ranks
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:39:20 should probably start reading your suggestions before you post them
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:42:03 rarely is an understatement
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:42:10 i don't even remember the last time someone got inventor
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:42:34 > orange got it for make something fly
vip got it for making a folding sub, imp got it for a flying iphone

plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:43:54 > yes but can we vote on old inventor ranks by modern standards now or no
you really think the entirety of the mod team will let that happen
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:44:04 pretty much everyone will lose their inventor if we do that
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:45:52 rick got inventor for making a torpedo

plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:16:49 nautical group was also removed from <#617941134605549579> though
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:17:11 suddenly im not as surprised
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:17:29 don't know why it was removed though
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:20:57 because everyone who got banned from here was able to seek refuge at the airport server
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:22:15 well to be honest i don't really care about it that much to demand it gets removed
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:22:27 and iirc the mods already know
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:22:30 or at least some of them
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:23:05 i remember seeing lots of banned people at that server
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:23:11 can't give any examples though cause i left
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:23:27 well there you go
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:23:51 who
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:23:58 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:25:32 that's probably how it goes for every other server in <#617941134605549579>
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:26:40 what server
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:26:55 crinj
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:27:39 server where you take literally every build paint it pink and add ears???

plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:42:08 hey i remember that guy
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:42:21 why is he active on that server
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:44:04 doubt it
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:44:14 the only think i remember him for is that constellation

```
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:54:11 best creations yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:56:54 remember when elon musk pixelart was in hof
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 19:59:57 wdym
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 20:01:35 it depends more on whether or not your build drowns in the sea of, well you know
plane-crazy 2020-04-23 21:06:43 not too much
general 2020-04-23 22:03:49 yes
general 2020-04-23 22:04:29 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/529858892075761694/702269642554474547
general 2020-04-23 22:05:33 because he can't
general 2020-04-23 22:05:49 it's not possible to add more save data
general 2020-04-24 07:33:43 remember when this
general 2020-04-24 09:57:26 your account only works on the server you created it on
general 2020-04-24 09:57:27 so no
general 2020-04-24 09:57:49 i mean yeah but why
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:08:38 so much iq you can't even measure it
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:32:37 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:32:53 and even if there was a vote, it won't pass
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:33:50 it's only the build itself that matters
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:34:05 it's also the time when you submit, and whether or not it drowns in other creations early on
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:34:34 the more it stays at the bottom of <#384025409945337856> , the more people see it, the more upvotes you can get
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 11:35:10 well there you go, i can relate

plane-crazy 2020-04-25 09:56:20 and it was denied
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 10:24:16 wheel arches look massive
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 10:24:22 A-pillars are a bruh moment
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 10:32:10 last one is best
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 10:32:13 but still not very good
general 2020-04-25 12:10:27 are you asking about the color or the car model
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 13:57:23 
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 13:57:28 how many people do you think are going it make it
plane-crazy 2020-04-25 13:57:47 gonna bet on at least 15
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:14:22 im here to save the day

plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:15:05 it took me less than 4 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:15:21 it's not mine
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:15:42 again, it's not mine
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:15:48 read the name on that picture
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:17:04 imagine begging for upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:17:14 this statement was made by everyone else gang
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:39:22 lightbulb section
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 08:39:33 
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 12:03:55 i've seen a flak 1 once
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 12:04:07 though i already left the server it was posted in
creations-chat 2020-04-26 16:02:55 how is this plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 18:12:37 what robo said
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 18:13:12 plane doesn't strictly mean crinj dighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:04:27 
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:04:29 gap moment
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:08:13 there isn't a rule that states no copying though
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:08:37 but copying is still pretty damn sad
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:09:06 > the copying rule should be scrapped
there is no copying rule
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:09:30 where does it say that
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:09:56 you got any proof?
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:10:12 because i've been in this server for a year, and reported people copying multiple times, yet no one was banned
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:10:29 so i don't know where you pulled that from, but it's wrong
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:10:51 rick will not even breathe in your direction if you claim to have your build copied
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:11:46 someone already invented the concept of a conveyor drive, you are using the same concept
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:11:54 the design you used doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:13:38 i do
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 19:14:27 HOW
general 2020-04-26 19:47:12 bro yes
general 2020-04-26 19:47:26 <@!335599526414909451> https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/704055625772171304
general 2020-04-26 19:47:55 what if we fill an entire server of derby mode
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 06:02:55 server?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 06:03:12 im eu
general 2020-04-27 06:39:37 oh yes bigbrains saying new top gear bad
general 2020-04-27 06:39:40 any reason why?
general 2020-04-27 06:40:03 how
general 2020-04-27 06:40:16 everyone says it's bad but can't back it up
general 2020-04-27 06:40:22 have you watched the later episodes
general 2020-04-27 06:40:32 have you watched it at all
general 2020-04-27 06:40:44 well then you are not allowed to say it's bad
general 2020-04-27 06:41:01 what the fuck is the logic behind saying it's bad without watching it
general 2020-04-27 06:41:02 it is funny
general 2020-04-27 06:41:18 ok one second
general 2020-04-27 06:42:04 https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=183214029680612
general 2020-04-27 06:42:12 i never said the new one is better
general 2020-04-27 06:42:27 but people saying the old one is bad without any reason is fucking dumb
general 2020-04-27 06:42:36 i watched the new one and i think it's great
general 2020-04-27 10:04:49 herr you're wasting your time
general 2020-04-27 10:05:12 dev said it himself, he "doesn't have the motivation" to add wedges
general 2020-04-27 10:05:28 true but it's still *a* waste
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:57:48 you need to disable the "set controls automatically" option
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:57:57 as long as it's on it will lock your camera
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:59:06 there is a workaround where you can keep the option on
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:59:26 just place a camera on the ground, set it to a random key (for example 6)
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:59:32 when spawned, press that key twice
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 11:59:56 after that you should be able to move the camera and use the control surfaces at the same time

general 2020-04-28 04:51:11 which charger
general 2020-04-28 04:53:00 i got
general 2020-04-28 04:53:03 not exactly the same year but same gen
general 2020-04-28 04:53:18 wat
general 2020-04-28 04:53:32 first
general 2020-04-28 04:53:40 and not that i've seen
general 2020-04-28 04:54:05 i did try making a 935 like 93 years ago but dropped it
general 2020-04-28 04:55:02 first one is way more important when you consider the entire franchise
general 2020-04-28 04:55:27 paul walker is in it bro
general 2020-04-28 04:55:46 literally every car in the first movie
general 2020-04-28 04:56:29 what
general 2020-04-28 04:56:36 m3 gtr is not rice
general 2020-04-28 04:56:41 it's literally a race car
general 2020-04-28 04:57:13 bruh
general 2020-04-28 04:58:43 i think both are 69
general 2020-04-28 04:59:04 either 69 or 70
general 2020-04-28 05:00:19 <@!409676438682206218> top is 70, bottom is 60
general 2020-04-28 05:00:24 69*
general 2020-04-28 05:02:15 actually no bottom one is 68
general 2020-04-28 05:03:55 loud
general 2020-04-28 05:04:07 you should check the price of GT350s
general 2020-04-28 05:04:24 those easily break 100k
general 2020-04-28 05:04:26 old
general 2020-04-28 05:04:34 based on 67 stang
general 2020-04-28 05:05:01 they are lol
general 2020-04-28 05:06:01 Bonhams expects it to sell for between $90,000 and $120,000. That's far less than what Hagerty values early GT350s, with '65 models averaging $287k (and topping $450k in concours condition),
general 2020-04-28 05:06:35 it makes big mone
general 2020-04-28 05:08:21 yes javelin good
general 2020-04-28 05:12:07 restomod javelin
general 2020-04-28 05:12:11 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>

general 2020-04-28 14:38:16 that will never happen
general 2020-04-28 14:38:27 unless a 7 year old finds rick in a public server and asks for it
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 15:03:50 dunno what design you're using but i never had frame drops when i use it
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 15:06:39 i used it on a 5k tank with treads and suspension and yet my fps wasn't affected

general 2020-04-28 15:24:54 for some reason he reminds more more of scout from that one piemations series
general 2020-04-28 15:27:20 back then the only requirement was for the creation to have 30+ upvotes
general 2020-04-28 15:27:26 you didn't need to go through a vote
general 2020-04-28 15:55:48 what fanfic are you talking about

general 2020-04-28 16:15:47 it's not even being busy
general 2020-04-28 16:15:53 it's that "he doesn't have the motivation"
general 2020-04-28 16:19:01 bruh it was mad?
general 2020-04-28 16:19:09 how

general 2020-04-28 16:20:40 all those are in the test place
general 2020-04-28 16:20:41 not main game
general 2020-04-28 16:20:52 so when you buy it on the main game, it buys them here
general 2020-04-28 16:21:12 not 53

general 2020-04-28 16:51:15 but i've never seen someone change their attitude when a guy says "im gonna report to the dev"
general 2020-04-28 16:51:23 was that ingame though?
general 2020-04-28 16:51:48 o
general 2020-04-28 16:51:57 was he banned from the discord or the game then
general 2020-04-28 16:52:13 <@456226577798135808> ahmadburger
general 2020-04-28 16:52:36 i'd love to see one time where rick took action about something from <#623337136267067393>
general 2020-04-28 16:52:57 threatening to express his opinion on the game?
general 2020-04-28 16:53:18 well clearly he's not getting them lol
general 2020-04-28 16:53:21 cause it's on 79%
general 2020-04-28 16:53:40 a 7 year old who said he'd dislike the game
general 2020-04-28 16:53:46 let me try finding the screenshot

general 2020-04-28 16:54:37 this guy types like he's 9 and got perma'd
general 2020-04-28 16:54:46 because he's clearly a master haxor
general 2020-04-28 16:54:56 i bet the game dropped to 79% just because of him
general 2020-04-28 16:54:59 yes
general 2020-04-28 16:55:09 literally the best username in existence
general 2020-04-28 16:55:12 ahmadburger

general 2020-04-28 17:00:08

general 2020-04-28 17:00:55 this man plays 12cm hours AT LEAST
general 2020-04-28 17:01:18 a lot
general 2020-04-28 17:01:41 settings

general 2020-04-28 17:02:18 which dark are you using
general 2020-04-28 17:02:19 screenshot
general 2020-04-28 17:03:22 actually wait no i just use the default dark mode
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:13:15 you can tell how much effort he spent making the model of that block
general 2020-04-28 19:11:01 why wouldn't it
general 2020-04-28 19:11:05 is it t-34?
general 2020-04-28 19:11:30 should still count
the-dump 2020-04-28 19:17:34 
the-dump 2020-04-28 19:17:39 don't need fancy machine to do it
the-dump 2020-04-28 19:18:09 not even my pic
the-dump 2020-04-28 19:19:08 how
creations-chat 2020-04-28 21:37:45 wrx with an I4
creations-chat 2020-04-28 21:37:46 bruh?
general 2020-04-28 21:54:02 _ _
general 2020-04-29 06:24:14 but you still can
general 2020-04-29 06:24:16 it is
general 2020-04-29 06:24:20 but not the way you think
general 2020-04-29 06:24:29 you can't ask for it
general 2020-04-29 06:25:04 miner got modeler because people in vipgen thought his rocket and thingyiforgotname was good
general 2020-04-29 06:25:12 so we did a vote for modeler and it passed
general 2020-04-29 06:25:40 bruh?
general 2020-04-29 06:25:46 i thought you were joking before
general 2020-04-29 06:26:01 wdym multiple
general 2020-04-29 06:26:32 what's the point of voting in staff again if staff can also vote in vipgen
general 2020-04-29 06:26:43 and if it passed in vipgen why wouldn't it pass in staff vote
general 2020-04-29 06:26:48 sounds like a waste of time
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 06:33:44 they're both
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 06:34:49 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:52:57 > not vip1 or 2
wrong
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:53:02 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:53:08 this is 1
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:53:51 imagine not being in secret vip
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:54:17 don't need to imagine
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:54:37 so that you can build without losre
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:55:00 it is secret because nobody can join it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 07:55:07 nearly nobody
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:26:11 1x7 wedge doe
general 2020-04-29 08:28:24 https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gun-builder-elite-modern-weapons-sniper-assault-rifles/id473752978
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:32:54 because when he tries adding wedges he gets demotivated
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:33:50 make that december last year
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:33:54 cause half triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:34:26 but it's been 5 months since he last added something people actually asked for
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:35:29 and knowing rick, we never will
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:36:54 a 7 year old asked for it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:36:58 let me find that picture
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:37:00 i shit you not
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:38:21 > just gotta hope
> it doesnt backfire
you do know what the average age of this game's playerbase is right
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:43:39 how is this man
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:43:44 and how is this wedge
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 08:48:01 <@!670939038999511041> server?

general 2020-04-29 09:25:30 16 is a bit optimistic but yeah
general 2020-04-29 10:54:29 if you start playing the game with any of these people will iterally hate you
general 2020-04-29 10:55:00 had your accoutn ok
general 2020-04-29 10:55:07 but played it for how many years?

general 2020-04-29 11:02:40 https://eu.wargaming.net/support/en/products/wotb/article/25202/
general 2020-04-29 11:02:51 as long as you have enough gold you can get it back
general 2020-04-29 11:02:57 if for example you sold it for 500
general 2020-04-29 11:03:08 you can get it back and have 500 gold taken away from your account
general 2020-04-29 11:03:14 wdym
general 2020-04-29 11:03:31 well then you can probably restore it for credits

general 2020-04-29 11:19:11 it becomes collector, and it sells for gold
general 2020-04-29 11:19:39 you can still play removed tanks
general 2020-04-29 11:19:46 you can do whatever you want with them
general 2020-04-29 11:19:55 except go through a tech tree

general 2020-04-29 11:21:59 it depends honestly

general 2020-04-29 11:22:32 they have big armor but they suck ASS
general 2020-04-29 11:22:36 especially t95
general 2020-04-29 11:22:55 if your team doesn't back you up (which they won't) you're fucked
general 2020-04-29 11:23:07 > I focused on the 2 worst trees

general 2020-04-29 11:26:45

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 15:27:16 why are you building i400
general 2020-04-29 18:58:58 5?
general 2020-04-29 18:59:00 more like 4"11
general 2020-04-29 18:59:09 😎
creations-chat 2020-04-29 20:25:00 a better idea is to just have a nitch in the middle so the tracks don't go out of place
creations-chat 2020-04-29 20:25:07 just like in uhhhhhhhh real tanks?
general 2020-04-30 06:11:06 probably more tbh
general 2020-04-30 06:15:07 he's talking about the police car picture
general 2020-04-30 06:15:08 oh my god
creations-chat 2020-04-30 06:23:24 it's rick
creations-chat 2020-04-30 06:25:03 no
general 2020-04-30 12:47:03 nice one
general 2020-04-30 12:47:10 the big funny has been achieved
general 2020-04-30 13:19:26 you get warned
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 13:32:27 dat fold tho
general 2020-04-30 16:08:49 decals don't need an overwrite
general 2020-04-30 16:08:58 but rick claims that they can be abused
general 2020-04-30 16:09:36 rare, you do need to understand that this dev has been reluctant to take a wedge and stretch it
general 2020-04-30 16:09:42 because it "demotivates" him
general 2020-04-30 16:10:03 so even rewriting the text blocks is pretty farfetched lol
general 2020-04-30 16:11:10 the point isn't that we have enough already (because we don't)
general 2020-04-30 16:11:16 im saying that he just won't add decals
general 2020-04-30 16:11:39 <@!452273029595267082> probably not
general 2020-04-30 16:11:53 mad doesn't trust anyone but rick
general 2020-04-30 16:11:56 so no more devs either
general 2020-04-30 16:12:29 i don't think anyone on this server has contact with rolijok
general 2020-04-30 16:12:40 personally i have never even seen him
general 2020-04-30 16:12:51 where

general 2020-04-30 16:13:10 bro moment
general 2020-04-30 16:13:21 pretty much
general 2020-04-30 16:13:45 and it also holds the record for the most inconsistent development progress
general 2020-04-30 16:14:22 why have speaker when you can take a block and add a black text circle on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:31:24 but i don't remember coca cola giving away a harrier for 7m points
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:31:43 yes what

plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:07:09 this man makes a 45234234 motor swashplate/suspension but uses these to keep the treads in place
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:07:12 o k
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:13:32 even cameras is a bad solution
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:14:20 a good tread shouldn't need anything extra to hold it
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:14:34 better yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:14:36 but still bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 18:15:03 you're right, cause they aren't
general 2020-05-03 18:36:03 memes don't get into hall of fame
general 2020-05-03 18:36:15 unless the build itself is actually good

none
general 2020-05-05 21:00:01 your speed remains the same but you start lagging
general 2020-05-05 21:00:08 that's why it seems slower
general 2020-05-05 21:00:22 no
general 2020-05-05 21:00:31 speed in reality doesn't change
general 2020-05-05 21:01:04 the game engine cannot keep up with the blocks and therefore has to slow down
general 2020-05-05 21:01:23 if lagging matters to you try lowering the block count for your build
general 2020-05-05 21:01:43 yes it's voxel
