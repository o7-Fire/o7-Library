plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:07:10 I feel like I‚Äôve seen it
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:07:44 It‚Äôs possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:08:31 Ye looks like it
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:09:19 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:10:23 Looks like an American hind
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:10:35 But smaller
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:15:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:16:13 I see no difference
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:16:40 Their the same picture

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:39:12 WHat HavE yOu dOne tO tOmaS!!!1!
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:39:42 It looks good
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:40:30 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:40:57 Kinda; Try replacing the cylinder with a half cylinder at the top
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:41:29 Then just motorlock the smoke pipe into the funnel
general 2021-07-08 15:42:15 I literally saw 3 guys doing that in my server
general 2021-07-08 15:44:35 O god
general 2021-07-08 15:45:20 I want them to add half triangle wedge 1x1 - 1x4
general 2021-07-08 15:46:17 Making smooth surfaces would be a lot more simple
general 2021-07-08 15:46:41 A
general 2021-07-08 15:47:19 Y   E   S
general 2021-07-08 15:47:54 The closest thing we have to a hollow cylinder is a deactivated smoke pipe
general 2021-07-08 15:48:14 But it‚Äôs the closest
general 2021-07-08 15:49:11 Actually it would be round wedge in placed on a 2x2 circle
