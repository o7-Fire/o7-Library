The Tale of Reff (454229426352422912)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:35:26 Is it just me, or do the train track switches not work? It de-rails my train everytime I go through the interchange.
creations-chat 2022-01-24 21:37:50 Well, truth be told, it wasn't much of a "train". Just some train wheels and a basic base.
general 2022-01-24 21:39:17 <@359613171495075842> speak here, chat cooldown is annoying. Lol
general 2022-01-24 21:39:31 But yeah, I dont know much about trains
general 2022-01-24 21:39:40 So I probably botched it
general 2022-01-24 21:40:43 I'm not on my PC currently, though it practically resembled a handcart. A square platform with 4 train wheels. That's about it.
general 2022-01-24 21:41:17 About 2 train wheels apart
general 2022-01-24 21:42:02 Ahhh
general 2022-01-24 21:42:40 I'll have to test that out later today.
general 2022-01-24 21:42:48 Any other tips?
general 2022-01-24 21:43:00 I'm still fairly new to Plane Crazy in general
general 2022-01-24 21:44:49 Hmmm
general 2022-01-24 21:45:25 So just like a motor?
general 2022-01-24 21:45:41 Ahh
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 00:23:54 Does this game get updated anymore?
