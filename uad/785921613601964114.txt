general 2023-06-22 01:40:04 got my $500 NX8 to work with war thunde
general 2023-06-22 20:21:08 a10 is for loitering
general 2023-06-22 20:21:14 similar to the A1 skyraider in vietnam
general 2023-06-22 20:21:29 supersonics cannot loiter
general 2023-06-22 20:22:20 A10 and F111 is the exact same as the A1 and F105
general 2023-06-22 20:23:30 once again
general 2023-06-22 20:23:31 loitering
general 2023-06-22 20:23:45 same resaon for the skyraider and 20mms
general 2023-06-22 20:25:55 because props are less efficient and have a longer takeoff run
general 2023-06-22 20:26:00 and smaller load
general 2023-06-22 20:26:44 A-10C holds about 3.5x the ordnance of a B-17G
general 2023-06-22 20:27:07 again
general 2023-06-22 20:27:09 loitering
general 2023-06-22 20:27:23 supersonic jets cannot loiter
general 2023-06-22 20:27:41 same reason A-1 skyraider was used in vietnam
general 2023-06-22 20:28:19 slow
general 2023-06-22 20:28:25 low capacity
general 2023-06-22 20:28:28 cannot sling
general 2023-06-22 20:29:05 helicopters are much easier to hit with AAA and small arms
general 2023-06-22 20:31:26 A-10 can hold around 600kmh in a straight line
general 2023-06-22 20:31:31 turning about 500
general 2023-06-22 20:31:54 yes
general 2023-06-22 20:32:05 lotiering aircraft have become important to ground warfare
general 2023-06-22 20:32:13 especially in vietnam
general 2023-06-22 20:32:30 zoom in, drop once, wait 2 minutes for it to come back
general 2023-06-22 20:32:59 they all come in at once
general 2023-06-22 20:33:17 F-35 is a decisive striker
general 2023-06-22 20:33:24 not a loitering support
general 2023-06-22 20:34:47 helicopters go about half the speed of an A-10
general 2023-06-22 20:34:56 referencing the ah64
general 2023-06-22 20:36:18 same top speed as the A-10's cruising speed
general 2023-06-22 20:36:26 in full throttle
general 2023-06-22 20:37:03 super tucano is about 100kmh slower
general 2023-06-22 20:37:25 once again
general 2023-06-22 20:37:34 the PROVEN tactic of loitering
general 2023-06-22 20:37:50 loitering aircraft have actually been used in every war since WWII
general 2023-06-22 20:38:02 except minor ones
general 2023-06-22 20:38:42 bay of pigs, iraq (first time), iraq (second time)
general 2023-06-22 20:38:47 afghanistan
general 2023-06-22 20:38:51 afghanistan (sovieT)
general 2023-06-22 20:39:01 once again
general 2023-06-22 20:39:03 loitering
general 2023-06-22 20:39:17 subsonics are there for their loitering ability
general 2023-06-22 20:40:37 the entire point of subsonics are to loiter
general 2023-06-22 20:41:16 A-7 
A-6
A-4

all in the age of supersonics
general 2023-06-22 20:42:06 30mm HEI rounds
general 2023-06-22 20:42:33 ironic how the Po-2 was in service at the same time as sabres
general 2023-06-22 20:42:51 the PO-2 was the first plane ever to be killed without being visually spotted first
general 2023-06-22 20:43:23 napalm uses fuel drop tanks (valuable)
general 2023-06-22 20:43:47 to keep the fuel tanks to loiter longeR?
general 2023-06-22 20:44:13 napalm doesnt mist up
general 2023-06-22 20:44:38 real
general 2023-06-22 20:45:50 very slightly slower than the cruising speed of an F-16
general 2023-06-22 20:46:13 F-16 going faster than cruising speed burns most of its fuel
general 2023-06-22 20:46:36 real
general 2023-06-22 20:46:40 shortest range in the east
general 2023-06-22 20:46:44 both
general 2023-06-22 20:47:27 so then you run out of fuel after dropping 5 bombs
general 2023-06-22 20:47:42 and also waste precious fuel which is no longer being produced
general 2023-06-22 20:48:26 you waste tons of fuel to drop 5 bombs and nothing more
general 2023-06-22 20:49:02 a singular 30mm HEI will kill anything in a 5ft radius
general 2023-06-22 20:49:23 and you have 1200 30mm HEIs
general 2023-06-22 20:50:06 ^^^^^
general 2023-06-22 20:50:16 lazerpig has no idea what hes talking about half the time
general 2023-06-22 20:51:34 which is better, 5 bombs with 40ft radius (200ft splash) or 1200 30mm HEI with a 5ft splash (6000ft splash)
general 2023-06-22 20:52:40 but like
general 2023-06-22 20:53:05 better for hordes
general 2023-06-22 20:53:23 waste of drop tanks
general 2023-06-22 20:53:47 yeah so you wont want to waste your shit

creations-chat 2023-07-14 02:35:09 they burnt out some motors while taxiinng 1972

had some other priorities ig so they left it out in the elements
we're only there on saturdays, working on the interior and electronics but it depends on the condition of the airframe for if it will fly again

Same B-17 from "Twelve o'Clock High" and a few other movies

it's gotten to the point where we have to restore stuff that was already restored years ago
