The Tale of Mr Random (376159778558312458)
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:02:49 i made a flying formula 1 vehicle which is kinda the last thing you would want a formula 1 car to do.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 02:26:40 after i built a flying f1 car, my build spirt demenished itself.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 02:27:37 also why that dude got blacklisted by everyone at that side of the build area or is it everyone but we can't see the other side?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 16:15:25 is there a rare easter egg in this game which makes the super rocket thrusters sound like people imitating an idling motor cycle?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 16:16:59 why?
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 16:17:56 i wanted to know why the heck my plane sounded like a room filled with people poorly imitating am idling motorcycle
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 16:18:24 was kinda funny, how rare is it?

plane-crazy 2021-02-21 23:59:03 i uhhhhh, recently returned to the game and had to build something but i kinda think its simple
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:00:25 that flies?
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:00:58 gl with that
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:01:39 i could see how you could manage to pitch up and down but not rotate
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 00:02:15 unless you integrate control surfaces into the wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 21:21:02 what's the requirement for me to upload media here?

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 21:25:46 has anyone ever tried experimenting with making a craft that is only able to be controlled by standing in certain positions to allow control?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 22:14:39 what's the fastest anyone has ever gone in this game?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 22:14:53 i almost can get 6500
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 22:15:24 that doesn't count
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 22:16:16 i`m trying to do it without bugging out the game
