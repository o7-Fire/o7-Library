general 2022-01-15 20:00:41 ok
general 2022-01-15 20:01:10 but its old. Dont expect anything special or with motor lock
general 2022-01-15 20:14:59 4600 empty inside. Looks like you didnt tell them them that the ship is a remake of a ship I made 2018 which was also a copy of a mobile game

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:24:26 why is everything called -lock now
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:24:44 motor lock was literally setting a motor to lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:25:24 since when is there a camera or piston lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:25:40 option
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:25:55 yes, that could be. I wasnt sure. But camera doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:26:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 21:28:26 y know what. Maybe I am going to learn everything about locking and try something big. My comeback. Only problem is that I am really lazy

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:28:21 Could get glitchy with only springs
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:28:42 Or the gear flips
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:29:17 Yeah, or maybe a piston. But you should try it out first
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:34:52 You can find infinite speed on reddit
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:34:58 But not sure if it's real
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:40:43 You can try to replace the springs with the piston. No settings. It also kinda works as a spring
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:40:56 Nvm one settings
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 23:41:08 But I have to check what it's called
