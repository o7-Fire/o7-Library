the bit you see in the middle towards the right which is white with a grey looking wedge ontop is the nose of the aircraft , the black bit on the top is the cockpit and the beam ontop is the main fuselage and then the bit on the bottom is the tail

plane is the Tu-22 Blinder D btw

creations-chat 2022-10-19 19:16:13 k , i would advise next time painting your planes before posting them tho btw, cus generally white unpainted planes dont get very good votes , plus , paint can make builds look way way better (or way worse if you're trash like me)

creations-chat 2022-10-19 20:11:24 ay finally another rocket builder at last , my rockets are mainly.... either old and questionable quality , or modern but unfinished because i dont got time most of the time


also to the guy who said its not overbuilt , i mean the area around the cockpit looks a bit overbuilt for something that i think didnt really need it at least in my opinion

creations-chat 2022-10-19 21:09:33 well in that aspect its much better than a lot of motor locked jets ive seen before , honestly didnt notice it was motor locked until i just took a second look at the tail lol
creations-chat 2022-10-20 06:20:02 I meant like , not that its good im just saying its hidden more well than a lot of other jets ive seen of similar quality

I aint saying its good

But its good in proportion to a lot of beginner jets ive seen
creations-chat 2022-10-20 15:50:05 sir , are you alright? In which aspect is my n1 half decent?
creations-chat 2022-10-20 16:02:42 **a lot**
creations-chat 2022-10-20 16:06:51 **you dont want to see how unfinished the interstages are and how realistic it is to the real n1 , in the sense that it fails about as much as the real thing**
