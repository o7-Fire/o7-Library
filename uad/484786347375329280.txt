plane-crazy 2021-02-18 15:57:43 I'm new, anyone have any good ideas for pvp jets?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:01:48 got any good anti-shredder tactics?
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:01:57 I keep getting rekd
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:03:00 hmm cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 16:06:03 aiming sounds hard
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 17:02:33 how upload screenshots

creations-chat 2021-02-19 06:16:35 I can't wait until i can post my latest build I think i need help with pvp fighters
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:11:25 anyone have any 1x1 wide guided missile designs? I can make a 3x3 and 2x2 but i can't seem to get a 1x1 wide missile to function
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:12:21 I think for that scale u have to have control surfaces, but given the masses I keep getting they are not enough to steer them
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:14:51 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:15:13 wait it is car?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:15:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:16:03 I'm gonna guess it has to do with the jerk of the motion, maybe too much speed on the wheels
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:16:52 I would put propellers or ballasts at or near the end where it keeps lifting up
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:17:09 idk, tell me how it goes
bot-central 2021-02-19 23:18:12 !rank
creations-chat 2021-02-19 23:21:07 looks great, idk if you want you could take on the challenge of adding suspension (unless your build already has some in which case great job of concealing it)
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:22:00 which way does the half track keep falling?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:22:16 does it lift the front or back up before?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:27:09 can you turn right without falling over to the left?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:28:25 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:31:21 I think it could be due to either differing speeds in the front wheels and back tracks or differing forces from them, an ez fix would be ballast or helium, another ez fix would be to fix the force issue with propellor
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:38:15 hmm, it works well on ground which means no ground to force problems there, I think that the boosters are impacting the movement too much, especially in air
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:38:49 solution would be to go back a bit and try to get it to drive without boosters
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:39:15 the suspension looks great tho, good work on that
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:39:26 I didn't even see it the first time

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:42:23 I am lost
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:42:30 I am truely lost
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:43:43 can u give me the dimensions for the build so maybe i can see if i can do something with it?
bot-central 2021-02-19 23:48:27 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:50:57 I think I figured it out i think its just that the center of mass is just too high
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:51:12 ye it big sad
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:52:11 I can't wait to post images, I've needed help on my SU-30 now for like two days
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:13:30 what kind and how big?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:13:45 and don't make shreder
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:13:47 please
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:14:46 ooh i see, and u want player not to be in it?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:15:32 nice, I've recently been working on tv missiles and missiles, tell me if i can help
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:16:25 dare i ask what is puri's pfp?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:17:53 wait i can do images now?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 00:18:23 watch out builds channel here i come B)
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:28:13 Any feedback on my Su-30 would be greatly appreciated, especially with regards to the rocket systems
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:32:04 because I can't fit regular landing gear near the body of the plane because of the diameter of the missiles. And I can't fit custom landing gear in the plane because there's nowhere for it to go, sorry for the late response I got put on slow mode.
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:39:34 lol tysm
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:42:01 yeah, i think its getting a ton of hate for the right reasons, the missiles are over-sized, the landing gear is a one time use and is trash anyway. But the long range missiles, short range missile and anti shredder air defense system on it are pretty good i think. (Sorry I'm still in slow mode so I'll respond to anything in 2mins)
creations-chat 2021-02-20 00:55:16 well u r certainly the hero in this situation
creations-chat 2021-02-20 04:55:26 What makes people down-vote? I feel like I see a lot of decent builds that get down-voted hard (the world may never know)
plane-crazy 2021-02-27 02:24:18 a new map would be so cool, wheres the leaks?
plane-crazy 2021-02-28 23:48:49 no
creations-chat 2021-03-01 04:20:28 haha ;-;
creations-chat 2021-03-01 04:22:35 sooo... a couple dislikes on my Mig, any feedback?

help 2021-03-08 18:18:58 Does anyone have any good small custom mouse aimed missile designs? i keep getting missiles that are 3 blocks wide.
help 2021-03-08 19:56:55 motorlocking is okay i just need it to be under three blocks wide, i keep trying to get something guidable under three but no luck so far (EDIT: sorry for the late reply i was in class)
help 2021-03-08 20:28:13 Me and a friend have been working on small (either 1 or 2 block diameter) guided missiles. 
we are having guidance issues, any help?
help 2021-03-08 22:31:24 Okay Iâ€™ll have one up in 5-10
help 2021-03-08 22:35:07 its says i can't post wmv (roblox screenrecord videos)
help 2021-03-08 22:36:15 ooh okay\
help 2021-03-08 22:37:37 hoping i did this correctly: https://streamable.com/uhid1g
help 2021-03-08 22:38:20 yeah, its just uncontrollable
help 2021-03-08 22:38:38 My goal is to make 1 block in diameter missile
help 2021-03-08 22:39:13 it works well as air to anti-sub but it has no guidance
help 2021-03-08 22:39:23 I'll add more, thanks!
help 2021-03-08 22:45:27 hmmm I added the control surfaces and it works better, but the speed makes it roll way too much (roughly goes 600) but when i decreased its speed it was no longer able to keep strait and kept falling I think adding helium will fix that but its kinda cheating
help 2021-03-08 22:46:00 idk it doesn't seem fair :P*
help 2021-03-08 22:46:38 is it possible that objects in this game can move so fast that they will not begin to fall?
help 2021-03-08 22:46:49 like a terminal velocity?
help 2021-03-08 22:49:50 I don't know i'll keep tinkering away maybe post later in creations if i get anything worthwhile
help 2021-03-08 22:52:15 yeah
help 2021-03-08 22:53:54 
help 2021-03-08 22:54:00 sorry if it trash image
help 2021-03-08 22:54:36 Green is the motor-locking the two are super rocket engines
