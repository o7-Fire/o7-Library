general 2022-12-03 17:41:21 Idk but i had a p51c
general 2022-12-03 17:42:05 I also had the f4u1d
general 2022-12-03 17:42:24 Yea but my favorite is the p51c
general 2022-12-03 17:42:30 P51c is like 9/10
general 2022-12-03 17:42:39 F4ud is 8/10 idk
general 2022-12-03 17:42:57 I only went for it bc i wanted the p47
general 2022-12-03 17:42:59 The p51
general 2022-12-03 17:43:15 But i unlocked the first p47 but i couldnt afford it
general 2022-12-03 17:43:42 I just hit and run
general 2022-12-03 17:43:59 Instead of turn fight
general 2022-12-03 17:44:06 Bc f4u1d and p51c are fast
general 2022-12-03 17:44:44 I mostly use the f4u1d for air support in ground battle

general 2022-12-12 06:56:11 You can?
general 2022-12-12 06:56:19 It just makes u look like a band kid
general 2022-12-12 06:56:29 Ok
general 2022-12-12 06:56:37 Dumbass > band kid
general 2022-12-12 06:56:53 That originated from the ussr
general 2022-12-12 06:56:59 😹
general 2022-12-12 06:57:20 The f15 is just better honestly
general 2022-12-12 06:57:39 And thats considering a fair fight
general 2022-12-12 06:57:49 Irl its gonna be like 5 f35s against a mig 29
general 2022-12-12 06:57:51 So ye
general 2022-12-12 06:57:57 Considering ur facing the US
general 2022-12-12 06:58:01 😂
general 2022-12-12 06:58:03 Ez
general 2022-12-12 06:58:25 Kid named countries that bought mig 29
general 2022-12-12 06:58:38 Exactly
general 2022-12-12 06:58:50 Poland is probably the best operator
general 2022-12-12 06:58:59 Most countries using mig 29s have untrained pilots
general 2022-12-12 06:59:57 Isreal f15s have good camo
general 2022-12-12 07:00:28 Im from vietnam
general 2022-12-12 07:00:35 So my english is bad
general 2022-12-12 07:00:40 Ok
general 2022-12-12 07:00:43 😂
general 2022-12-12 07:00:46 Isreal
general 2022-12-12 07:00:48 Cry abt it
general 2022-12-12 07:01:01 How
general 2022-12-12 07:01:10 ?
general 2022-12-12 07:01:45 Its ok our military is outdated so im a us fanboy
general 2022-12-12 07:02:31 Ok
general 2022-12-12 07:02:49 The f15 is just an overall a better aircraft
general 2022-12-12 07:03:08 Ok
general 2022-12-12 07:03:34 The f15 has the rugged used look but the mig 29 has curves
general 2022-12-12 07:03:59 Ye
general 2022-12-12 07:04:10 They both are very great though
general 2022-12-12 07:04:19 Very good thrust to weight ratio
general 2022-12-12 07:04:46 Honestly if my life depended on it then i would fly an f15
general 2022-12-12 07:05:29 Ye
general 2022-12-12 07:05:37 Ok
general 2022-12-12 07:05:51 Mig 29 good for airshows
general 2022-12-12 07:06:34 And then us found out how bad it was
general 2022-12-12 07:06:57 The us thought it was a fighter jet
general 2022-12-12 07:07:04 For air superiority
general 2022-12-12 07:07:11 The mig 25 is like a brick
general 2022-12-12 07:07:29 Mig 31 better
general 2022-12-12 07:07:44 Mig 19 kind of underrated
general 2022-12-12 07:08:16 Ye
general 2022-12-12 07:08:25 F-86F was the best
general 2022-12-12 07:08:29 And could outclimb migs
general 2022-12-12 07:09:08 Super hornet
general 2022-12-12 07:09:22 Super raptor 😈😈
