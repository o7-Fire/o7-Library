creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:43:51 seen one at one of the military training bases here
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:07 it's pretty destroyed though
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:16 the whole front is pretty mangled
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:29 and there's only the left seat
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:44:44 middle console is ripped out too
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:45:29 neither of the propellers are there either
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:45:45 the engine is still there i think
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:46:01 i have no idea
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:49:31 ill try and make a huey since ive had a personal experience with one
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:50:55 i think the tail rotor is on the wrong side
creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:55:46 some training base in indiana has some broken huey

creations-chat 2018-11-07 14:56:39 we visit the base every now and then for some obstacle course there
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:20:16 id recommend adding propeller blades
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:20:29 and have the rotors rotate
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:22:17 half blocks don't generate lift
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:22:25 the whole point of rotors is to generate lift
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:22:47 and you tilt to move
creations-chat 2018-11-07 15:23:48 reee

bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:10:30 conveyors dont work outside bases if you change how theyre controlled, they keep working adjacent to them though
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:10:58 https://gyazo.com/69b8ea0533e8031acd70a367a593cbf8
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:11:08 they were perfectly centered in the base
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:11:46 the ones going out to the sky and towards the black dont keep going
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:11:53 but the ones going to an adjacent base still work

bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:13:23 the conveyors that go to ajdacent bases go off the gif
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:17:40 yeah it happens along the whole face that goes towards the map and away from the map
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:17:41 https://gyazo.com/2ad9504789cd9b86e6c3633870e8977d
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:18:02 as you can see, the ones that go to other bases go out of frame
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:20:46 please fix conveyors
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:21:05 they can go into other bases but not into the map or away from it

bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:28:22 and both forward is w
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:28:45 you cant make the one with d stop if you press w and d
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:29:08 it lags you to death
bug-reports 2019-11-27 22:29:49 it doesnt work like how motors do where if you hold both forward and backward it just stops

bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:04:22 the moment that the conveyors touch a surface it just goes backwards
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:06:39 okay no

creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:37:42 aaa
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:37:56 how do you make a falcon 9 copy without it being unstable af
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:40:23 i have a barebones version of it just to get the mechanics right
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:40:34 but it quickly starts spinning uncontrollably
creations-chat 2020-02-12 20:41:40 well i was trying to make it have sorta grid fins like how the actual falcon 9 has

help 2020-02-12 22:28:09 okay so for some reason, when i tilt in any direction my rocket starts to tilt back in the other direction, im pretty sure its because it doesnt like changing direction cause of the wing panels i put inside but im kinda stumped as to how to fix it

general 2020-02-12 23:01:40 for some reason my mouse locks up for a moment after i place a bunch of blocks
general 2020-02-12 23:01:41 i dunno why
general 2020-02-12 23:01:48 i think its a roblox problem but im not sure
general 2020-02-12 23:02:12 no
general 2020-02-12 23:02:18 cause the game runs fine
general 2020-02-12 23:02:39 maybe.
general 2020-02-13 01:19:17 theres a dude in my server that claims that he can glitch conveyors by moving it immediately after you place them, and somehow that makes it faster, and hes also basically saying that he has methods of basically arbitrary code execution
general 2020-02-13 01:19:23 this is the first time ive heard about this so im pretty skeptical
general 2020-02-13 01:20:48 yeah.
general 2020-02-13 01:21:22 i got more and more skeptical when he got more into detail about it
general 2020-02-13 01:21:34 like, apparently hes a glitcher and codere
general 2020-02-13 01:21:45 zivicio_god is his user
general 2020-02-13 01:21:54 dont harrass him
general 2020-02-13 01:21:55 i dunno.
general 2020-02-13 01:22:07 he isnt exploiting or anything as far as i can tell
general 2020-02-13 01:22:12 i dunno who 7ach even is so
general 2020-02-13 01:22:29 o
general 2020-02-13 01:22:32 yeah i dont think hes him
general 2020-02-13 01:22:47 well this guy is doing it by like
general 2020-02-13 01:22:57 really specific block orientations and stuff i guess
general 2020-02-13 01:23:03 thats what hes saying
general 2020-02-13 01:23:09 like
general 2020-02-13 01:23:19 he says that somehow that manipulates the code into making conveyors faster
general 2020-02-13 01:23:25 but like
general 2020-02-13 01:23:45 he wont open his planes to confirm so
general 2020-02-13 01:23:48 like
general 2020-02-13 01:23:49 delete part of it
general 2020-02-13 01:24:21 no
general 2020-02-13 01:24:24 wait
general 2020-02-13 01:24:25 what
general 2020-02-13 01:24:31 i dont think hes exploiting
general 2020-02-13 01:24:35 he doesnt seem like it
general 2020-02-13 01:25:08 i mean i did simplify what he said as basically arbitrary code execution but im pretty sure roblox doesnt work that way
general 2020-02-13 01:25:37 he also said some bogus stuff like. frame blocking or something like that
general 2020-02-13 01:26:01 stuff ive never heard anyone talk about
general 2020-02-13 01:26:12 im not talking about like, injectors
general 2020-02-13 01:26:26 o h
general 2020-02-13 01:26:39 no
general 2020-02-13 01:26:56 oH GOD
general 2020-02-13 01:28:46 i doubt arbitrary code execution is as simple as placing a few blocks tho
general 2020-02-13 01:29:54 oo
general 2020-02-13 01:30:15 nice
general 2020-02-13 01:30:35 yeah
general 2020-02-13 01:31:10 again, what that dude said in my game is just too specific to be believable
general 2020-02-13 01:33:37 oh one other thing
general 2020-02-13 01:33:50 the dude said that he apparently "sued" some dude for copying one of his designs
general 2020-02-13 01:34:33 yeah lmao
general 2020-02-13 01:34:57 yeah
general 2020-02-13 01:35:32 except my builds are so crappy that ive never seen anyone copy them
general 2020-02-13 01:39:27 okay this guy just talked about windows 11
general 2020-02-13 01:39:30 bruh
general 2020-02-13 01:55:01 yknow that guy i was talking about?
general 2020-02-13 01:55:15 hold on.
general 2020-02-13 01:55:43 https://gyazo.com/b960b101664fc5845834b8615494e618 this is what the conveyor engines look like
general 2020-02-13 01:56:58 apparently if you put a propeller on the end of the conveyors and then place a  half wedge behind it with the flat part on the conveyor and propeller engine
general 2020-02-13 01:57:09 and move the whole plot right after you place that wedge
general 2020-02-13 01:57:14 it glitches the conveyors
general 2020-02-13 01:57:17 im pretty skeptical
general 2020-02-13 02:00:09 tried to keep them in frame but its hard, the left one, which is "glitched" flies a little differently despite both the conveyor engines being made the same way except for the glitch
general 2020-02-13 02:00:10 https://gyazo.com/e13b5d747f2a24b5c94b89f5211c7be9
general 2020-02-13 02:29:51 ok
general 2020-02-13 02:30:51 honestly i didnt think gridfins would work but they actually work for me
general 2020-02-13 02:31:15 i cant put it on my mini falcon 9 but i made a big test thingy
general 2020-02-13 02:31:55 wh
general 2020-02-13 02:31:57 thats
general 2020-02-13 02:31:59 not what im doing
general 2020-02-13 02:32:01 nevermind
general 2020-02-13 02:37:52 i killed this chat lmao
general 2020-02-13 02:37:53 im sorry
general 2020-02-13 03:21:21 yeet
general 2020-02-13 03:21:29 pretty barebones but it lands
general 2020-02-13 03:21:44 and yes thats gridfins
general 2020-02-13 03:22:30 i have to use helium to get it up though, cause it gets unstable with just rocket propulsion
general 2020-02-13 03:22:36 i dunno why
general 2020-02-13 03:22:42 probably something to do with the gridfins making the center of drag be really high up
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:23:42 https://gyazo.com/242aa62e5574019caf9cbde01d427e34 barebones falcon 9, im suprised that ive managed to land it on the pad every single time ive tried so far
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:24:04 i have to lift it by helium though, it isnt stable enough for some reason
general 2020-02-13 03:24:16 yeah.
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:29:58 maybe.
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:30:05 im pretty sure its because the center of drag is super high up
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:30:43 true
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:30:51 but i dont really have much space for it so
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:31:01 plus makes me more accurate
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:31:32 i dont suicide burn tho, i try to but i have so much thrust i usually shoot myself back up for a moment
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:47 wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:50 shells?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:31:52 hold up
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:32:05 no i do slow myself down
creations-chat 2020-02-13 03:32:13 i just tend to fly up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:32:32 thats interesting
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:32:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:03 but you need a crap ton of it
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:10 just like
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:33:13 shove them using magnets
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:38:09 sorta
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:38:15 i guess?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:42:58 i dont think you can fit cutters in these tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:43:06 hank if you can figure out a way to make those create recoil that would be insane
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:43:45 wait hold on i want to try making apfsds
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:07 wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:07 okay no that would be too complex-
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:27 its armor piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:48 i dont think you can fit sabot in that sadly
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:49 rip
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:44:50 yeah.
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:32 i wish there was explosive immune blocks so you could make like, proper guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:42 thing is shell ejection would be impossible
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:45:45 you can i think
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:02 just make a big platform or something
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:05 well wall or platform
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:16 oh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:46:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:41 it isnt that fast tbh
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:49 i just made it myself
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:47:52 it goes pretty slow
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:48:03 o wait hold on
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:48:08 superstrength?
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:50:53 yeah blacklist cutters are super op
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:51:20 i made a machine that was literally designed to tear holes through stuff by blacklist cutters
plane-crazy 2020-02-13 03:51:29 like it was basically entirely made of cutters

plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:53:59 but yeah its basically flashfantom's strv
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:06 but i added side skirts and lights and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:15 huh
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:44 hm
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:54:47 kinda
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:14 its hard to make the weird fence thing on the front tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:55:54 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:04 except mine has side skirts
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:24 its like the 103a except with side skirts i guess
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:38 i  think its 103a
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:45 im too lazy to get on wot
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:56:50 to check
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:19 oh wait its the 103-0
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:20 im dumb
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:36 oof
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:57:50 i mean flash's 103 was the 103-0 anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:12 aaaaaaa i want to make a plane but like
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:46 but i have so little mental energy the only thing i could make would be another variation of this
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:58:47 https://gyazo.com/0c16ea85a573637c37103c610f31ceca
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:02 at least in like. design
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:12 i mean it actually flies pretty nice tho but aaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:34 ive always wanted to make something big, like a zeppelin or something but
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:40 im too lazy
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 00:59:41 aaaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:22 like, i wanna make something big that can get shot at and just kinda look cool as it gets destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:28 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:00:59 aaa nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:13 i meant something that could take hits and still be able to fly but look cool while its damaged i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:22 i need to get better at making a zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:01:53 OH i remember that idea i had a few hours ago
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:03 i wanted to make like, a battleship turret with details and stuff inside
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:16 im probably just gonna wing it but reee
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:44 not just the turret tho, like, it has the decks below it and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:45 well sorta
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:47 yknow what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:02:52 the loading stuff below it
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:25 actually yknow what im just gonna go with what i wanted to do before
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:33 maybe ill think about doing that later
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:03:38 noice
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:06 i would make the bismarck or something but i dont have jetpack, thats one thing thats really needed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:26 that and i cant fold for shit
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:28 reeeeee
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:04:38 sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:05:08 NHB5QJU9A59E45H
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:05:13 jesus
general 2020-02-25 01:25:47 what if it were possible to get negative internet
general 2020-02-25 01:27:25 no like negative upload/download speed
general 2020-02-25 01:27:26 idk
general 2020-02-25 01:27:34 i have like 1 brain cell right now
general 2020-02-25 01:29:35 yeah ik
general 2020-02-25 01:29:43 im just dumb
creations-chat 2020-02-25 01:31:50 wh
general 2020-02-25 01:32:19 bruh
general 2020-02-25 01:32:49 do they mean corner wedges?
general 2020-02-25 01:33:05 er
general 2020-02-25 01:33:07 triangle wedges
general 2020-02-25 01:33:17 but those are fine so wh
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:35 WAIT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD FOR MAKING STUFF THAT NEEDS TO GO DOWN
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:45 instead of using suspension you can use locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:51:59 cause they like, pull in for some reason when you dont move them
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:15 true
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:45 magnets would work pretty well for folds tho, especially if like, the original fold motor gets destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:52:52 just kinda an idea for my zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:53:07 oh wait magnets weld to stuff too dont they?
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:03 yeah those would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:15 or like blocks that actually weld you rather than how magnets do
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:29 a game i used to play called space construction had that
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 01:54:48 though it tended to be weird and not connect accurately
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:16 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:56 also oof that isnt your ship vip but it doesnt really matter, the game is old af anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:57 at least i think it isnt
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:00:59 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:06 i know the original pe-
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:14 WAIT I REMEMBER YOU ACTUALLY
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 02:01:18 you were barely on tho
general 2020-02-25 02:02:12 lmao they just locked it
general 2020-02-25 02:02:13 rip
general 2020-02-25 05:04:57 :B:rotogen
general 2020-02-25 05:05:01 oh
general 2020-02-25 05:05:08 i need sleep anyways
general 2020-02-25 05:13:00 h
general 2020-02-25 05:13:47 bruh basically just second life
general 2020-02-25 05:15:05 anyways im gonna like, actually sleep for real
general 2020-02-25 05:16:16 fuck you im doing it anyways
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:42:50 "light"
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:43:03 >has like 3 turrets with 4 guns
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:43:36 what
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:44:04 there is, there's like a french one and a couple russian ones i know of
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:45:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:45:55 oh fair the kiev kinda isnt
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:46:20 tog 2
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:46:50 alot of them are paper tanks but yeah
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:47:13 yes i know
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:47:19 wasn't talking about the tog
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:48:46 yes i have but ree
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:48:54 also i read it
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:22 that's a helicopter carrier
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:35 O
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:49:38 yeah there is
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:51:09 change my mind trimarans are cool
creations-chat 2020-02-25 05:55:14 all that does is just eject the cartridges
creations-chat 2020-02-25 05:55:19 it doesnt shoot
creations-chat 2020-02-25 05:55:46 still good i guess
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:58:32 conveyor engine kinda ew tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:58:49 why not make it go fast with just motor power
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:02 also serious critique of your boat tho. i would make it wider
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:23 like, reference something like the kiev
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:37 true but it just kinda looks weird and top heavy imo
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:45 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 05:59:49 sorry my brain isn't working
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:02:20 fair enough
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:02:35 it *is* hard to make something that actually shoots with recoil to be fair
creations-chat 2020-02-25 06:04:20 yeah
general 2020-02-25 07:49:13 that's just the controls for the jetpack?
general 2020-02-25 07:49:24 i mean i don't have it but it doesn't seem weird
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:50:07 change my mind warships sucks
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:50:19 le bote rebooted is better
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:51:14 true
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:51:29 but at least you progress faster
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:18 actually i would argue that a carrier fleet with repair ships is more meta
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:25 cause they never die
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:50 oh wait i don't think that's in rebooted
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:52:53 not sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:54:07 yeah fair
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:55:03 honestly i definitely think le bote rebooted is at least slightly better as far as balancing, it isn't too annoying to grind
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:55:21 i dunno
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:10 i mean slightly better than the old version
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:32 i need to sleep anyway
plane-crazy 2020-02-25 07:56:49 i know ive said that like 5 times tonight but aAAA
creations-chat 2020-02-25 08:00:15 cutters are just impractical unless you blacklist everyone just to skewer them
creations-chat 2020-02-25 08:00:46 yes i made a flying machine designed for that and only that purpose
general 2020-02-25 08:01:14 ships already do have limited range, it's kinda useless tho
general 2020-02-25 08:01:41 yeah true
general 2020-02-25 08:02:34 yeah but you can just ignore that by shooting somewhere and using the button that focuses your camera on your shells
general 2020-02-25 08:02:58 i do that all the time in naval 1918 or whatever it was
general 2020-02-25 08:04:01 im pretty sure battleships have antisubs irl tho
general 2020-02-25 08:04:18 though it's about as useful as they are agile
general 2020-02-25 08:04:30 i guess
general 2020-02-25 08:04:45 could've sworn that they did but a
general 2020-02-25 08:04:52 it's like 3 am my brain isn't working at all
general 2020-02-25 08:07:58 fair enough
general 2020-02-25 08:08:26 oh god yeah lmao
general 2020-02-25 08:08:35 OH GOD
general 2020-02-25 08:08:46 there isn't even a currency in le bote tho
general 2020-02-25 08:09:18 no please i don't want fuel and ammo, there's a reason only mobile games have them cause it's obnoxious af
general 2020-02-25 08:10:28 there's a le bote rebooted, it basically uses the same like. engine that naval 1918 uses
general 2020-02-25 08:10:38 also battleships were always broken
general 2020-02-25 08:10:48 though the carriers were more broken in the old le bote i think
general 2020-02-25 08:12:08 also the secret to not being destroyed by bbs is to not keep rushing the middle constantly
general 2020-02-25 08:12:26 though even then they destroy you fast
general 2020-02-25 08:13:03 i like using the russian hovercrafts personally, they look cool plus they're fast af
general 2020-02-25 08:13:38 might not get torpedoes but i mean rockets are good too lmao
general 2020-02-25 08:14:08 and rockets can actually do something now since the AA isn't hyper accurate
general 2020-02-25 08:16:58 id rather have better dps than aa
general 2020-02-25 08:17:13 personally
general 2020-02-25 08:17:14 so
general 2020-02-25 08:19:03 no thank you i would rather not have pvp weapon spam even worse
general 2020-02-25 08:20:01 imagine boxes with 200 guns spawncamping you just because you exist
general 2020-02-25 08:20:11 rip
general 2020-02-25 08:20:30 is it like the yamato except with even more secondaries

general 2020-03-08 19:57:54 cause the way i have mine, i tend to aim in first person cause its easier
general 2020-03-08 19:58:02 but i have no way to tell depth

creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:05:01 i guess a car with like 3 wedges and no interior means effort to you?
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:05:04 damn
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:05:10 pretty low standards imo
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:07:38 i could make a civic better than that kid but i dont want to because civics are SHIT
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:08:09 was talking to noobdude
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:08:28 since apparently he thinks that a car with about 2 wedges and no attempt at an interior is effort
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:09:53 yes
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:11:35 okay compared to the shit i used to make my mr2 is a million times better

creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:16:37 i would have added rims to it but its hard to make ones that look right so i just left it without them
creations-chat 2020-03-25 14:17:34 okay. first off what do you think i should change about it since arguing about it anymore won't do anything

general 2020-03-25 14:22:46 aw11 mr2
general 2020-03-25 14:23:05 i think part of what throws it off is that i made it too high but

general 2020-03-25 14:24:00 maybe

plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:03 oh
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:09 ive tried making that in stormworks
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:39 i would reccomend using real measurements just to estimate the actual size
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:45 uhh.
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:50 maybe one of the german jet bombers?
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:51 o
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:22:55 ho 229 perhaps then
plane-crazy 2020-03-25 15:23:37 o

help 2020-05-01 00:23:46 cause i dont want my suspension bouncing constantly when im sitting still
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:27:08 what suspension settings makes suspension less bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:27:20 because i would rather not have my car bouncing constantly while im SITTING STILL

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 16:30:20 rip
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:37 i would just make it with a skeleton frame
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:43 thats what i did with my quad
plane-crazy 2020-05-14 23:17:56 also, make the propellers using control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:44:46 why did you give it the wot turret
plane-crazy 2020-05-16 20:44:52 and not the actual real turret

creations-chat 2020-08-06 20:50:50 that concorde tutorial is pretty funky tho
creations-chat 2020-08-06 20:50:57 whatever that one is
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 15:56:15 anyone have ideas for a gun stabilizer without using motor2s?
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 15:56:18 also holy shit thats an ungodly amount of locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 15:57:47 im asking cause i want to be able to use it in first person and still be stabilized
help 2020-08-07 15:59:31 anyone have an idea for a vertical gun stabilizer? i cant use gyros for it cause just n o
help 2020-08-07 16:01:51 ok thank
help 2020-08-07 16:06:37 i wanna be able to use it in first person
help 2020-08-07 16:07:09 cause motor2s with cameras look weird
help 2020-08-07 16:07:18 well dont work
help 2020-08-07 16:07:38 yeah
help 2020-08-07 16:08:25 what do you mean by that
help 2020-08-07 16:08:28 aa
help 2020-08-07 16:09:06 no if you do that it doesnt stabilize
help 2020-08-07 16:09:18 or do you mean have it aim at the gun
help 2020-08-07 16:10:49 w a t
help 2020-08-07 16:11:02 how do you make it not turn
help 2020-08-07 16:14:00 i dont understand because the camera would still be connected to the turret
help 2020-08-07 16:14:10 or do you mean connected to the hull?
help 2020-08-07 16:15:17 it would still move because the suspension makes the hull bounce
help 2020-08-07 16:16:10 and thats why im trying to make it stabilize so i can use it in first person
help 2020-08-07 16:16:33 well actually i want to make one for its own thing tbh
help 2020-08-07 16:16:38 yes
help 2020-08-07 16:28:32 oh
help 2020-08-07 16:28:46 i meant like using a camera oof
help 2020-08-07 16:28:49 but rip
help 2020-10-05 04:36:56 how do i fix the bug where my seat is attached to something with an excessive amount of motor lock
help 2020-10-05 04:37:22 like the gun on my tank has motor lock so i can have more detail
help 2020-10-05 04:37:55 and for some reason it just reaches this like, critical something where my seat is attached to it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:41:00 how do i not have my main pilot seat attached to a motor locked thing cause for some reason the gun on my tank is doing that
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:41:13 like, my pilot seat is attached to the gun no matter where i put it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:41:33 wtf now it stopped doing it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 04:41:34 nevermind then
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:26:10 yeah no his is completely different
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:28:13 similar size but made completely differently
that's the thing with my me 262, people think that its a tutorial as well cause its a similar size to a tutorial 262
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:30:15 use a variety of blocks, not just cubes.
half wedges and stuff, longer wedges. just experiment with different blocks to see what looks better
creations-chat 2020-12-18 18:32:17 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-12-25 17:56:11 i wanna try making a harrier at some point
should i?
creations-chat 2020-12-25 17:58:19 i think i could do it considering my me 262's looks. old screenshot but still. also it aint a tutorial, made it from scratch
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:01:08 im pretty happy with my 262, its one of my best builds, it looks pretty damn close to the real thing imo and its smol
also fair
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:05:30 i think a good idea would be to reference some kind of 3d model of the thing youre making, or at least rely on multiple angles
the thing with the 229 is that the shape  sucks for pitch authority at least with plane crazy's physics
general 2021-01-02 14:03:57 A
general 2021-01-02 14:04:13 I HAVE BEEN SUMMONED
general 2021-06-22 18:28:06 wish there was wind or something cause sailships kinda dont work like they should without it
creations-chat 2021-12-17 23:39:23 i wanted to make like, one of the orbital mac stations from halo but my brain is too small to figure out how to make it move like the game
creations-chat 2021-12-17 23:58:05 nice
