creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:10:03 yea, ive currently got it in the 8x 100kg bomb loadout, but im considering using a 1x torpedo loadout instead
the other 2 loadouts are: 3x 250kg bombs, and the 1x 500 kg bomb
which one should i use
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:13:31 the mad vulpen doesnt even have a ki-67 tutorial, and i doubt he builds like this plot garbo

ok bc dyno bot hates me im just saying im not coming back to this game until 2 things happen: One, PC2 comes out, and Two, people in this community are less toxic to casual players. Its like the minimum expectation is something out of <#627195143040139264>
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:38:02 you are a prime example of why im quitting this game. may be bullshit but its true
creations-chat 2023-07-14 20:57:31 yeah im done
creations-chat 2023-07-14 21:02:27 stop pinging me
general 2023-07-14 21:03:32 wot
creations-chat 2023-07-14 21:14:46 firstly, im disabling pings from this server from now on, and secondly, i dont have a sister
creations-chat 2023-07-14 21:18:58 why do i not have a sister or why am i disabling pings?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:15:22 hows this so far? and how can I improve?
im tryna make the Su-24
<@641439058719014913> ^^^
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:18:29 What Half wedge? and also Ok. (how many blocks smaller should the nose be?)
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:21:17 made the nose a block shorter, and if u mean the circled block as a half wedge, its a motorlocked normal wedge. its locked into the nose (2 wedges side by side) <@788733970522832896>
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:26:52 could yall like not shit on peoples builds for 2 seconds? i want some helpful feedback from <@788733970522832896> because I dont know what he means by half wedge
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:31:49 thanks. i guess.. best compliment you can get in this community
i would post a pic of my cockpit along with this but cant cuz it wont load
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:34:35 i just realized how am i gonna make doors, its a 2 seater it makes sense.
prob trapdoors cuz i do not want to deal with more locking and shit
im not even a quarter done and its 160 blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:38:17 none of my images are loading so i cant demonstrate, but i found the ultimate solution: a gaping hole in the cockpit for the copilot. it works perfectly, somehow. and when i get out, it spawns me outside the plane, its perfect.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:46:18 12, also seriously, please stop saying shit and arguing with others, i just wanna try making my builds better using player feedback and arguing subtracts 2 minutes of my time for every message.
And <@788733970522832896> a motor door wouldnt work cuz the glass is motorlocked into the pilot seats, I went with just an open design that doesnt show too much, and the plane still can be easily entered without it looking too ugly
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:10:44 ive used trapdoors for my door now instead of a hole, cuz it works just as fine. i think ill use cam locking to make the spine of the plane
creations-chat 2023-07-16 21:22:30 make the wheels fabric, for more friction, therefore more speed.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:15:38 whats wrong?
<@375281006091173890> be a bit more specific please.
I want actual feedback for this and I really want this to be good, and <@900445207395434536> THANK YOU. I just want this to actually gain upvotes, so im trying to get feedback from people here to actually make it good
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:22:09 about the spine, i wanna cam lock it when i get to the rear, so thats fine, and also I really just want a small attack aircraft, i dont want to overdetail it. also wtf u mean by arms? also benja thank you for the 3d model
oh im stupid i thought u meant the aircraft spine... sorry
creations-chat 2023-07-16 23:53:44 ok ima restart my Su-24. its disproportionate with what its supposed to be and i am struggling to actually continue it
creations-chat 2023-07-17 01:51:31 how am i gonna make the sweep wing
yes i redid my SU-24, bc you guys asked.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 01:55:49 explain, what can I do to fix it?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 01:58:28 if youre talking about that blue "arrow", thats part of the paint scheme... but thinking about it, it should be a tad different
creations-chat 2023-07-17 02:11:04 yes ik mines shit compared to that but i just want something good for PVP that doesnt look dogwater. just an AVERAGE build, not some week long project like this
ok?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 02:49:52 for my first sweep wing in this game, i think i did a good job
just your average plane here
creations-chat 2023-07-17 03:15:12 yo what did u use for the vertical stabilizer? i cant decide between 1x1 and 1x2 wedges, cuz they both dont really match the angle im going for.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 03:28:26 look at the vid i sent, also whats goof about it? I want to fix it.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 03:31:37 the color is just a placeholder, i wanna make some kind of german livery later, but right now im basing it off a 3d model im using
I was gonna ask the same thing <@523003901075521536>
creations-chat 2023-07-17 15:52:45 tail sucks cuz im lazy
creations-chat 2023-07-17 19:06:23 
creations-chat 2023-07-17 19:23:30 I agree! even tho its my attempted SU-24
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:13:14 bobmz
time to add gun pods cuz yes
also ok ill try <@563012956447571968>
what RGB do u recommend
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:46:23 thank you, its just bad by the standards set by this community.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:49:51 i just tried to make a good ground strike aircraft. its got 8 bombs, 2 custom air to air/ground missiles, and 6 gun blocks. I wanna add rocket pods and some extra gun pods
its also my first sweep wing aircraft
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:54:16 video with me dropping bombs, firing missiles, showing gear, and wing
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:57:28 people told me to restart, but i didnt. until i realized it was completly off the correct scale, and continuing it would be horrible
so i restarted my SU-24 and got it to where it is now.
anyway where do yall think I can add gun/rocket pods? I may have to remove some bombs
