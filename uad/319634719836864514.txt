creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:52:45 I listen to alot of different genres
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:52:59 But I base what's bad and good off of what actually takes effort to make
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:53:11 and dubstep takes little to no effort
creations-chat 2020-04-29 10:53:17 It's literally samples

general 2020-04-29 10:58:09 Okay, <@!322970944303923200> I'm in this chat
general 2020-04-29 10:58:19 gonna cook up a real sick dubstep beat
general 2020-04-29 10:58:25 I'll have it done by tomorrow
general 2020-04-29 10:58:40 You'll see
general 2020-04-29 10:58:55 You don't know that
general 2020-04-30 00:12:18 Its a computer graphical glitch
general 2020-04-30 00:12:55 when coordinates of objects gets too big, things get wacky
general 2020-04-30 00:13:04 cause computers can only hold so much data in one variable
general 2020-04-30 00:13:10 it's not only roblox
general 2020-04-30 00:13:17 it happen in a lot of games
general 2020-04-30 00:13:30 not only roblox m8
general 2020-04-30 00:13:40 its graphics in general
general 2020-04-30 00:14:14 https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/numbers-and-math/a/number-limits-overflow-and-roundoff
general 2020-04-30 00:14:23 There are limits in variables
general 2020-04-30 00:14:25 in computers
general 2020-04-30 00:14:32 it's not only roblox
general 2020-04-30 00:14:36 bruh
general 2020-04-30 00:14:41 I know it happens in roblox
general 2020-04-30 00:14:44 but theres a reason
general 2020-04-30 00:15:13 Jesus dude
general 2020-04-30 00:15:17 me
general 2020-04-30 00:15:17 Are you not hearing
general 2020-04-30 00:15:22 I know it happens in roblox
general 2020-04-30 00:15:29 but It's not because of roblox
general 2020-04-30 00:15:47 exactly <@!410992368494575626>
general 2020-04-30 00:15:53 there are variable limits
general 2020-04-30 00:16:46 Computers have to compress large numbers, so when you go up real high, or off to the left to far in anything (any graphical interface) the computer has to compress the numbers and things get weird
general 2020-04-30 00:16:57 there are examples in every game
general 2020-04-30 00:17:01 YES
general 2020-04-30 00:17:02 I KNOW
general 2020-04-30 00:17:17 I stg, your not listening
general 2020-04-30 00:17:26 can you actually read what I'm saying?
general 2020-04-30 00:17:35 oh my god kid
general 2020-04-30 00:18:03 <@!410992368494575626> I'm glad you actually have some brain cells
general 2020-04-30 00:18:10 atleast someone does
general 2020-04-30 00:18:30 Yes, but roblox uses graphics doesn't it?
general 2020-04-30 00:18:36 DOESN'T IT?
general 2020-04-30 00:18:40 you can't deny that
general 2020-04-30 00:18:41 yes
general 2020-04-30 00:18:46 okay lemme walk you through this
general 2020-04-30 00:18:49 so
general 2020-04-30 00:18:53 variables
general 2020-04-30 00:18:57 they have a limit
general 2020-04-30 00:19:02 and when you hit that limit
general 2020-04-30 00:19:07 computers compress it
general 2020-04-30 00:19:19 So when it gets to big it has to cut off the last digit
general 2020-04-30 00:19:25 and when that happens
general 2020-04-30 00:19:42 traingls vertexes have to move to an exact point
general 2020-04-30 00:20:04 I feal like your just f*cking with me now
general 2020-04-30 00:20:11 I stg I'm done
general 2020-04-30 00:20:15 you are the only one not getting it
general 2020-04-30 00:20:25 literally everyone else is getting it
general 2020-04-30 00:21:20 Yes
general 2020-04-30 00:21:30 Fred obviously doesn't
general 2020-04-30 00:21:41 I've been developing lots of games since 2012
general 2020-04-30 00:21:44 So stfu
general 2020-04-30 00:22:47 <@456226577798135808> Let me give you another example of what I mean by the variables getting compressed
general 2020-04-30 00:24:41 Minecrafts version of variables limit breaking the game
general 2020-04-30 00:24:46 Boom
general 2020-04-30 00:24:53 evedince it happens in other games

the-dump 2021-03-30 02:43:30 yes, this server had a minecraft server like two years ago
the-dump 2021-03-30 02:43:58 the server is now offline, but I kinda wanna make a vip only one
general 2021-03-30 05:41:55 I love how the only rank I have is the inventor rank
general 2021-03-30 05:42:07 I literally don't have anything else
general 2021-03-30 05:42:29 I'm sorry, my burden has returned
general 2021-03-30 05:42:37 I am back to talk for another day
general 2021-03-30 05:43:04 I'm going to apply for inventor rank for the 4th time now
general 2021-03-30 05:43:27 yes, I got it the first time
general 2021-03-30 05:43:38 and the other 2 times they said wouldve earned it too
general 2021-03-30 05:43:46 so I basically have 3 inventor ranks
general 2021-03-30 05:44:33 a dinosaur related build?
general 2021-03-30 05:44:48 that's not even what inventor is about lol
general 2021-03-30 05:45:19 inventor is about making a new way of doing something
general 2021-03-30 05:45:21 like folding
general 2021-03-30 05:45:32 that was probably the biggest invention
general 2021-03-30 05:46:08 Id like to see the build lol
general 2021-03-30 05:48:07 I'd say I made one of the most controversial builds on the server
general 2021-03-30 05:48:21 my led zepplin "mothership" build
general 2021-03-30 05:50:14 haven't see that one lmao
general 2021-03-30 05:50:57 I call mine controversial because it's votes up and down were even despite being fairly high on both sides
general 2021-03-30 05:51:24 *crimson* thank you very much

general 2021-03-31 09:53:26 uuh
general 2021-03-31 09:55:46 like 3 different things. 1st was a aggrivated mass drive. Still havent seen someone use that in a build tho lmao. 2nd was a method of using wings by bending them back and forth to gain or lose lift. and then the third I don't remember
general 2021-03-31 09:55:51 probably something stupid
general 2021-03-31 09:56:49 it's a really simple concept actually
general 2021-03-31 09:57:19 basically just using a motor to change weight distribution in order to control rotation gradually
general 2021-03-31 09:59:25 lol, I mean, it can be used for a few different things
general 2021-03-31 09:59:52 I built a few different types of it
general 2021-03-31 10:00:39 well if by that you mean get the rank, that's no longer available
general 2021-03-31 10:01:11 but if you mean the original way you got it, that's also the reason you can't get it anymore
general 2021-03-31 10:01:24 because there wasn't really an exact definition for "invention"
general 2021-03-31 10:02:08 thats not an 8, thats an x chromosome
general 2021-03-31 12:02:29 I wanna do an ask reddit where I ask, "Whats the crappiest thing you've ever done that you regret to this day?" and then wait for some replies, only to then change the title to, "What's your favorite memory?"
