general 2021-10-08 23:16:33 Even with guns
general 2021-10-08 23:17:01 I think so yes
general 2021-10-08 23:17:12 Had shredders and wings folded to a rectangle
general 2021-10-08 23:17:17 I didn't take one but
general 2021-10-08 23:17:21 Still didn't kill me

general 2021-10-08 23:18:27 I like how some people use mag engines
general 2021-10-08 23:18:32 While I use rope engine
general 2021-10-08 23:20:04 Same
general 2021-10-08 23:20:15 I was trying to use a mag engine to transport a turret
general 2021-10-08 23:20:24 Ended up getting 4000+ speeds
general 2021-10-08 23:21:59 Some sacrifices require the strongest wills
general 2021-10-08 23:22:09 I still have my rope drive plne
general 2021-10-08 23:22:16 It still works just
general 2021-10-08 23:22:40 I upgraded it with mag drive controls but still can't controll the rope
general 2021-10-08 23:54:11 I like how people just casualy try to chill in pvp untill the shredder army shows up
general 2021-10-08 23:54:20 Then I take out my worm
general 2021-10-09 02:09:10 Stop right there criminal, you have violated the law, pay the fine or face your time

general 2021-10-09 12:42:00 All fly even though they shouldn't
general 2021-10-09 12:42:03 Like my car
general 2021-10-09 12:42:37 So that explains why they won't STOP FLYING FOR ONCE
general 2021-10-09 12:42:46 Even when half of it is missing
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:22:14 Unpainted builds be like
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:22:52 Should I post a carrier on the underside of the map
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:22:57 (It has wheels)
general 2021-10-09 13:23:58 Ah that's normal
general 2021-10-09 13:24:06 Just bring out your biggest build
general 2021-10-09 13:24:16 And install a warp drive
general 2021-10-09 13:24:27 Then fly away

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:30:17 Now do it 1 more time make it move on a motor
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:30:22 And make sure it flies
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:30:41 How big
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:31:09 Ok so its prob more than 2000 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:31:31 Atleast it's not flying carrier with big mobility
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:32:20 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:32:25 That's not bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:32:46 Uh
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:32:48 Oh no
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:33:18 *cri in small carrier builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:33:45 Also why are shredder bug users not good at hitting or damaging you
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:34:09 Yeah Goodluck
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:34:21 *screenshot*
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 13:34:50 Oh God that's like 5x more blocks than my biggest

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 00:50:40 Gos
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 00:51:05 Looks like I need to get a flamethrower
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:08:49 No I already have multiple shredder bug designs in mind
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:08:59 Very easy to make them anyway
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:09:59 I have been able to make a 5x7x3 shredder bug size
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:10:13 But it's better with gun
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:10:21 Even then the design wasn't good
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:11:00 The bug would sometimes just die if it looses a few wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:11:22 Thats why I improved with a 3x7-9x 4 ish shredder size
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:11:29 Was more stable
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:11:35 And more effective
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:12:02 But even then I put guns on it and removed the shredders
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:12:52 Hold on
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:15:47 
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:15:59 I'm on mobile atm
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:16:24 It has some motor locking at the back and front other than that it works ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:17:27 Now I can't stop thinking of the giant drone that I made once
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:17:41 Each block on the bug was like 5x scale
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:19:06 Atleast I'm starting to get into the bigger build types and stuff with
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:19:08 Oh that
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:19:13 I've done that I guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:19:24 Not too effective when you ship is faster than it but
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:20:20 I did that once also but didn't do too much either
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:21:54 Also why do people in shredder circles think that they will be able to SHRED a carrier with multiple layers and ladder armor moving 400 speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:22:49 Hold on I'm going to get a screenshot real quick
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:17 Because it deals much damage
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:24 Reminds me of my explosive moon
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:43 Yet they don't do toomuch damage if your small or quick enough
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:23:52 I've had a swarm not able to hit me
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:24:33 Shredders are more aimed toward bigger builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:30:05 Like I question how people can't hit this
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:30:38 Good point but sometimes I just don't use my engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:30:56 Ah don't worry
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 01:31:00 I use pc

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:22:19 No just use 4 magnets and make it spin
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:22:23 Then release
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:22:27 Or reset
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:23:26 Also would a carrier that's about maybe 2 blocks or 2.5 blocks tall exist
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:29 I made it fly though <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:27:26 Its like a shredder bug vs a gun / rocket bug
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:27:34 The shredder always dies

plane-crazy 2021-11-23 00:03:39 Until you have to deal with 300 speeds and lag or fast moving targets
