general 2023-03-07 20:34:06 Btw guys you think pc2 ever coming out?
general 2023-03-07 20:35:38 I think that if it doesn’t update the game will die out very quickly
general 2023-03-07 23:08:56 You know that electric cars  don’t use combustion
general 2023-03-07 23:10:30 Electric uses cooling liquids
general 2023-03-07 23:11:28 Depends who you ask
general 2023-03-07 23:12:37 Which is fabricated where
general 2023-03-07 23:14:48 It wouldn’t
general 2023-03-07 23:19:32 I would buy the Audi e-tron even though it is electric there will be more environmental rules in my country which would turn an gasoline car into massive amounts of costs
general 2023-03-07 23:20:41 It wouldn’t it is build so low to the ground that it would bury itself
general 2023-03-07 23:21:53 Aenoqx I am starting to feel like you are like a 7 year old or something along that age
general 2023-03-07 23:22:47 I am not a kid anymore in 11 months
general 2023-03-07 23:23:48 Yeah welcome to the real not everything can be like you want it to be
general 2023-03-07 23:24:55 Aenoqx when you grow up you are going to hit a wall when you realize you can’t fix everything
general 2023-03-07 23:25:49 If you say this in public you will probably end up in the ICU
general 2023-03-07 23:28:22 If everyone hated them and there weren’t enough of them to do these giant protest (which would be enough people to make you end up in the ICU) then they would have already gone extinct
