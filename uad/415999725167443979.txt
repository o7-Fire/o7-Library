creations-chat 2022-07-21 18:15:33 I like the vapour cloud on the f-16
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:19:21 good angle lock
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:23:04 I also think i see the delicious acute angle of the intake
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:25:14 Koenigsegg? In that case I absolut-ly agree. üòèü§ì

creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:37:41 agree
creations-chat 2022-07-23 19:41:47 That f-15 from earlier was really nice

creations-chat 2022-07-23 20:49:43 thanks man i have a better cockpit for my cf-101
creations-chat 2022-07-23 20:55:57 I based the cockpit from the irl one- definitely a lot different but there some resemblance. (Also no problem will do Blackskull)
creations-chat 2022-07-23 21:10:33 also why should I change the jet engine from the intake if it more closely resembles real life?
creations-chat 2022-07-23 21:21:15 F-22 not f-15
creations-chat 2022-07-23 21:23:33 
creations-chat 2022-07-23 21:25:48 Yeah i moved it back- i might even have to get a smaller engine since the engine doesn't take up the whole space.
creations-chat 2022-07-23 21:38:44 Are hover engines frowned upon since they are a glitch? Good because I have some thrust vectoring jets using them

plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:14:52 Yeah my pc ain't good enough to fully model a perfect body- sometimes i get lucky and it just looks good but not really.
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:15:34 Lots of angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:15:42 and constantly looking at the source material
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:18:29 I think my favorite cockpit is my f-16's
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:18:39 simply because of the field of view
plane-crazy 2022-07-23 22:20:55 absoluely none

creations-chat 2022-07-30 19:06:26 yeah i second that
creations-chat 2022-07-31 05:00:28 <@456226577798135808> nice drawings bro- try putting a airbrushed lighter layer over the afterburner  similar in color to the afterburner itself. It makes it all glowy and such.

Good point- muck around and have fun. Great drawing nonetheless.
creations-chat 2022-07-31 05:09:08 <@878809539858804767> not bad stuff. Try integrating the leading wings into the airframe a little more. Give it a smoother look. And if your pc can handle it- i believe a hover engine might work (if you wanna go as fast as a real b-52)

Also try making the the wings angle down a lil
creations-chat 2022-07-31 05:50:11 Gaw dan this poor man

creations-chat 2022-08-06 21:17:36 oh yeah my bad bro- you were talkin bout the eurofighter being supreme. I jost said the gripen was good too. Nothing to worry about.

creations-chat 2022-08-06 21:51:32 Honestly the frogfoot they give you is pretty capable as is, but Im probably gonna see if i can get my hands on the j-11 or f-15

Ohh nice choice- i was thinking about it.
creations-chat 2022-08-07 03:36:31 You going for a space station interior? Because if so that conveys it perfectly

I can see it now- still really nice and does absolutely look good. Can't wait to see the finished product
creations-chat 2022-08-07 04:27:01 That perfect feeling when your launched missiles flyby your cockpit 

It extends to maintain stability at higher speed (also yes they are still massive )

creations-chat 2022-08-09 15:46:35 Oh yeah now its lookin good
creations-chat 2022-08-11 00:56:15 <@709575810855469098> I like that gun design for the Phantom. I might use that for my mig-27.
Good stuff
creations-chat 2022-08-12 19:19:21 I think both the f-16‚Äôs are real nice. Some of the features on both make me realize i need to revise my design a little bit.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 03:52:37 at least a 9/10
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:50:30 nah the f-35 does have decent thrust to weight but it cant recover from lost momentum like an f-16 or an f-22

(Still nice jet thooo)
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:53:03 Yeah i suppose due to its INCREDIBLE stealth it still ranks leagues above the 4th gens.
But i rest my case its a lil sluggish compared to a nimble f-16 or even f15. Even if it's just a LIL bit
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:55:07 And I mean just take a look at growling sidewinders "7 f-15 fighters vs 1 f-22"
Good stuff that f-22. Im sure the f-35 would have done the same.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:58:17 Totally agree. Even if the dogfight gets to the speeds where you can execute those maneuvers- they just kill all your momentum.
general 2022-09-04 21:04:11 W
general 2022-09-04 21:04:57 yes for possibly self guided missiles and such
general 2022-09-04 21:05:06 i think that would help significantly

general 2022-09-04 21:05:28 but not self guided

creations-chat 2022-09-05 21:13:52 gus fring/10
creations-chat 2022-09-09 04:34:49 I think- popping the whole nose forward 2-3 blocks will make it look even cooler
creations-chat 2022-09-09 04:39:13 I think its totally savable, shift the nose out just 2-3 blocks (to help it look less like a turtle hiding in its shell) and enlarge the distance between the sweeping wings and elevators around the same amount.

Slap some decals on there and boom a true f-14--  oh ok nvm üíÄ

creations-chat 2022-09-17 17:47:57 do a wideshot that shows what we are looking at- my guess is abandoned rail way?
creations-chat 2022-09-17 17:50:10 if so, it's not particularly too bad just add some wing lights that look like pebbles and half wedges for debris.

creations-chat 2022-12-13 03:50:24 To be fair, if you‚Äôre a really experienced builder and you had to make the choice between the two buttons. üóø
Honestly if you see a build that is just genuinely hot garbage then downvote it. But if it seems to have some good work put into it- but its just not up to ur standards- just ignore voting, and don‚Äôt jump on the downvote bandwagon.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 03:54:00 Show the front intakes
creations-chat 2022-12-13 03:56:35 Brilliant- you got winglights on it? Otherwise the detail is class.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 04:02:25 No worries chap- I should be finished my full sized Drake Caterpillar soon which is a successor to my 3rd creations post. So you lot look forward to it i‚Äôve been throwing my life away for months on it. Otherwise I need to peace out; keep up the good work you lot.
