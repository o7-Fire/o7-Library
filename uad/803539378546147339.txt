help 2023-07-04 09:03:10 i need help with my helicopter
help 2023-07-04 09:05:59 this helicopter does not work, i watched a tutorial from someone who explained how to make double rotor helicopters and i used his high performance rotor blades. It worked when i just put a block below the motor that propells the rotors. it did not spin. But when i put my design there instead of the block it stopped working.
