creations-chat 2023-06-29 19:55:33 someone named thughunter/Nickson_BRO is using scripts to copy other people builds no matter how complex they are so if you ever see them block them and dont let them see your good stuff
creations-chat 2023-06-29 19:57:42 yeah well hes one of them, said he paid 7 dollars for it and when he copied something my friend made he was so apathetic and bragging about it
help 2023-06-29 20:45:14 ok thank you, basically what is going on here is the top photo is a scripter that copied my friends ship, the scripters name is Nickson_BRO/thughunter. My friends ship, the original ship he has been spending months building is the bottom ship. The scripter copied it because my friend has a friend that posted the picture of him with his ship in another discord server, and the scripter copied it using the username on the plot in the picture. There's not much that can be done besides solidifying the fact that my friend made the ship originally, and not the scripter.
help 2023-07-01 08:01:45 Well he said in reports channel that we would be giving anyone that sends him a report a warning. Unless this is an exception I‚Äôm not sure
