general 2021-12-03 21:25:10 dunno why they were there or where tf they came from

general 2021-12-03 21:33:15 i dont feel like it
general 2021-12-03 21:33:19 10d something
creations-chat 2021-12-04 04:10:57 wtf?
what tutorial bruh
creations-chat 2021-12-04 04:13:14 any specific one?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 04:20:23 i mean it's based off the same plane... of course they're going to look similar
creations-chat 2021-12-04 04:34:17 those parts being...?
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:03:59 not really, im pretty sure mine is smaller than both
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:06:38 apparently coincidence doesn't exist, even in a game with this many players
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:08:59 built an f18 last night, kinda annoyed now cause it got taken down for looking like others
it's the same plane, of course they're going to look similar if you tried to build it accurately
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:11:23 in a game with tens of thousands of players is it that unrealistic for a couple people to have the same idea of what scale a plane should be
might as well say i copied the US military
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:14:23 whatever, i won't try and argue my point anymore
if you want to delete this for "copying another build" go ahead
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:16:24 they're also much more detailed and complex builds
creations-chat 2021-12-04 05:19:17 don't ping me and i won't come back to this
that simple
