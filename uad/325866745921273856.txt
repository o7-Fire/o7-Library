help 2019-04-03 15:42:45 Thanks. I put another one at the back and now it sort of steers.
creations-chat 2019-04-03 22:40:51 A tank. Very scientific  testing. The tank fell off after this angle so using tangent we get an angle of tan(8/10)=1.0296 radians. Rounding to the correct number of significant figures, we get 1.0 radians.

https://i.gyazo.com/da24cdccea5d5e1869ca0a620b24f917.gif
creations-chat 2019-06-04 19:59:11 Yes. (The wheels are really poorly designed though, the car has to drive backwards to get good grip)
creations-chat 2019-06-04 20:01:30 The biggest problem is the wheels themselves give the lift, so if I tilt them outwards when driving forward it produces lift (Reducing grip), and if I tilt them inwards steering is impossible.
creations-chat 2019-06-04 20:03:14 It would greatly increase the amount of keys and operation of the already way too complex keybinds.
creations-chat 2019-06-04 20:04:33 WASD, QE for fixing sideways tilt, VB for turning in air, TG for tilting wheels.
creations-chat 2019-06-04 20:29:59 When you make a flying car but then realize you've been doing everything wrong... inward tilting rotors fixed everything XD

This is the fourth version of some random thing I made.
The first version was trash with the wheels turning in an inconvenient method, causing it to be unstable in flight.
The second was improved but still required steering and tilt engines.
The third version removed the steering engines but not the tilt engines, improving handling.
The fourth and most recent version removes the tilt engines, and adds yaw to satisfy VTOL requirements.
