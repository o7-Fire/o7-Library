the-dump 2021-07-07 02:44:56 This made me happy somehow
help 2021-07-08 19:34:31 I still can't send images here but, can some staff join my game?
help 2021-07-08 19:34:48 There is someone here using a bot to go like "(Someone's name) <-- Scammer"
help 2021-07-08 19:36:17 I would use Roblox's report system but... meh, you know, I never saw it work.
help 2021-07-08 19:36:38 And the problem is that I don't know who is doing it
bot-central 2021-07-08 19:36:52 !rank
the-dump 2021-07-08 21:00:25 OMG
bot-central 2021-07-08 21:08:25 !rank
help 2021-07-08 22:06:21 I joined the server and it was like that, being spammed at like every 1 minute
help 2021-07-09 23:38:30 How do I use the <#507673335816126509> ?
help 2021-07-13 17:55:08 Welp, the game just died here. Something about maintence. The same happened to you?
bot-central 2021-07-19 00:49:31 !rank
creations-chat 2021-07-19 00:53:05 Hmm... Have you made it from a real tank? Because I'm finding the top part a bit weird

help 2021-09-01 03:30:30 What are the meassurements of Plane Crazy for speed (Kilometers per Hour, Miles per Hour, Studs per Second) and height (Feet, Meters, Studs)?
help 2021-09-01 03:31:30 What?
help 2021-09-01 03:32:11 I'm 17.
help 2021-09-01 03:33:27 Because each capitalized word refers to an item from the Universal System of Meassurements
help 2021-09-01 03:33:47 I am trying to make vehicles from real life and I want to make them as fast as they are in real life
help 2021-09-01 03:33:57 I need to know this
help 2021-09-01 03:34:35 But it is based on studs or...?
help 2021-09-01 03:36:08 Uhm- Don't ping me in every anwser, thank you
help 2021-09-01 03:36:27 I do believe it is in Miles and Feet, but I'm unsure...
help 2021-09-01 03:36:39 I wanted to know
help 2021-09-01 03:41:43 Why do you type like a kid who doesn't know what is a capital? <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
help 2021-09-01 03:47:54 Yeah, but I just lke to use anyway.
help 2021-09-01 03:55:28 I don't know how your build is, but I believe you can try to replace some aligned blocks with beams to save smaller blocks
help 2021-09-01 04:02:39 I recommend you look for some real life references on the Internet
bug-reports 2021-09-01 17:12:45 I was sailing with my ship but then this guy appeared and started glitching it and then used the parachute. I blacklisted him to try avoid it but the parachute is still solid to the ship. This should be fixed so the blacklist go-through feature can also be applied to it.
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:41:56 Awh thanks. :P
Thank my friend too, he helped alot. (OnoctM)
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:46:15 I also helped with the ideas for the foldings and stuff, it's very tricky
creations-chat 2021-09-06 15:54:39 The problem is that Carpathia doesn't have interior, and there is a bug in the game that doesn't allow buildings to teleport when they are above 10k blocks
creations-chat 2021-09-06 16:22:47 Only the funnel
the-dump 2021-09-15 21:35:55 My character just glitched in space-and-time
https://gyazo.com/d6ab77bb188a8b69260525bc43140919
general 2021-09-19 16:27:52 How?
help 2021-10-20 05:33:11 I am making a huge bulk carrier and I still need to make the aft. castle, but the hull from where it will come with motor lock doesn't have space. What do I do?
help 2021-10-20 05:43:26 The main problem here is that the bow and the stern gets thinner than the center part, and I want to build the superstructure just in that place
help 2021-10-20 05:43:52 The other stuff on the deck I can handle because they can get bend down inside.
help 2021-10-20 05:48:23 
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 16:52:15 Huge ships convention
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 16:52:37 then Queen Mary 2 gets crashed
bug-reports 2021-10-23 03:46:29 I want to report a bug that may be well-known here, but I'm doing this again in hope for it to be fixed soon:

There is an annoying bug with the parachute collision that cannot be disabled with the blacklist feature and it use to cause buildings glitching and flying into the air. It means that people can use this to destroy other buildings and no one can actually do something to stop this.

I got no photos of a building glitching because the events happens very fast, but I have this photo of the parachute collision issue that I have posted before in here.
help 2021-11-24 04:09:39 So I'm making this "small" heavy bulk carrier ship... and I'm having some problems about the usage of space. The after deck tower (the white thing on the middle) comes out from inside the hull by motor lock, but it is from another section of folding. How do I bring it to the other part?
help 2021-11-24 04:10:41 The ship has 4 foldings in total,and the tower has to go to the last one (the very back of the ship)
help 2021-11-24 04:35:21 I tried to do it using that motor lock on the top but it just seems to make it worse
help 2021-11-24 04:36:07 What
help 2021-11-24 04:38:35 Yes but what does it have with what he said?
help 2021-11-24 04:39:08 I mean, you can move the "ball" by putting wings on other places I guess
help 2021-12-12 18:39:15 Is there some place where I can report people?
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 18:51:17 OwO
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 18:51:36 I never saw this menssage before, how neat
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 18:52:14 no
help 2022-01-09 18:43:42 I have an important question about the Plane Crazy store: Will the items that I bought in Plane Crazy 1 be moved to Plane Crazy 2?
help 2022-01-09 18:44:37 Is there a standard way to ask this to a developer?
help 2022-01-19 16:53:48 What happened with the game?
help 2022-01-19 16:54:11 I have tried to join it 3 times, and none of them worked. I also tried to join other games but this time it worked.
help 2022-01-19 17:11:00 It is because I tried to join other games after this and it worked
help 2022-01-19 17:11:09 but when I tried to join Plane Crazy again it didn't
help 2022-01-19 17:11:32 meh
help 2022-01-19 17:12:03 A friend of mine also suffered this same problem at the same time with me
help 2022-01-29 01:12:54 Do someone know what is the measurement for speed and height in Plane Crazy? I want to make a plane with realistic speed but I can't tell what the speed is based on.
help 2022-01-29 01:47:54 ...
help 2022-01-29 02:07:40 A stud is like what in meters?
help 2022-02-23 04:05:36 The volume of the speakers changes the range of the sound or is it fixed?
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:14:16 **E.**
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:15:57 It says here the game was updated _tomorrow_ <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:23:16 It seems that the update "broke" the ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 01:23:21 All the settings reseted
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 23:20:23 The water proppeler sound is gone..
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 17:49:43 ...bruh... The water proppeler sounds are gone
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 17:49:50 And all the sounds of my boat too
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:23:25 hah
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:25:01 what
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:25:30 ...
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:25:35 It's Mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:26:01 It doesn't
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:26:09 A friend of mine found this
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:26:39 It's basically Plane Crazy but "fancy"
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:27:15 I don't know about this game but it's there since half of 2021
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:27:38 Well, I don't
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:27:49 I just got to know it today
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:28:13 ... How can you be so sure that I am a minority? '-'
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:28:26 The game is new after all
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:28:34 Holy indeed.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:28:47 2021
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:29:42 That is... sad
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:30:03 Yeah, it's this game
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:30:13 It is
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:30:34 I'm 18
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:31:14 Sure
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:31:35 You seem kinda younger to write like that.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:31:39 :bruh:
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:31:59 eh
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:32:04 I'm not gonna argue that
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:33:25 Anyway
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:33:30 How are you?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:33:59 Oh, what happened?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:34:34 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:35:00 Ah nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:35:05 Get mad at me.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:36:56 When I first entered, I tried to spawn on water, but I guess we can't now
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:37:03 I went to make a boat
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:37:22 Yeah... I think I could have done it
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:37:31 The problem is to make a car big enough
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:38:06 Summer I think
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:38:16 Rick announced not long ago
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:43:51 Basically you need to complete some "quests" to get the ranks.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:44:10 In some cases you just ask for the color
help 2022-03-31 05:47:38 How do I use the <#507673335816126509> channel?
help 2022-03-31 05:48:03 I saw that I cannot write directly in it, so there must be another way
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:48:53 I wish the game had more than 1 airport
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:49:04 so planes could have an actual place to go
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:50:34 Eh. It just need to be more higher.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:51:11 _what_
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:52:05 Uhmm... I guess seeing what other people build will do.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:52:43 I learnt most of the stuff from my friends
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:52:55 Then I teach some of them what I know
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:53:05 ah
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:53:11 That's hardcore
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 05:55:33 <:EYES:525319504721608705>
help 2022-03-31 05:55:44 Ah...
help 2022-03-31 05:55:56 Weird that I need a rank to suggest
help 2022-03-31 05:56:06 But thank you.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:00:42 I think it's the smoke
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:00:52 and that amount of blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:01:39 Oh and talking about lag, I wanna ask about it to someone who knows it
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:02:07 I also have lag as a problem with some builds... so I want to know what are the laggiest blocks of the game
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:02:23 No, lag of FPS
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:02:28 Not actually Internet
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:03:12 I feel like the ropes are too, right?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:03:33 It's because I was making a ship
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:03:41 and I put a lot of ropes to make a long anchor
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:03:59 and I noticed that it seems that the shorter they are the less laggy they are
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:05:09 As far as I know, most of the lag in a ship comes from the blocks in contact with the water
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:05:30 Wait, true?
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:06:13 You have to rebuild the hull
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:06:25 Replace the much blocks you can with beams
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:06:52 I done a test in the water one time. I created two identical boats
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:07:06 The only difference is that one of them was made with beams, the other was with singular blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:07:15 The one with beams sailed faster.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:20:22 I like to make a realistic speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:20:52 The 1000 speed in Plane Crazy is most likely 1900 miles per hour
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:21:29 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:21:49 Which is ironicaly very similar to Kilometers per hour anyway.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:22:26 I feel like the height is also measured in studs
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:24:01 The thing is what I myself don't need to worry much because of this coincidence about the Studs per Hour being like Km/h
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:24:12 But I know that most of the people in USA use miles
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:24:15 (I wonder why)
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:24:23 1 mile is like 0.4 kilometers
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:25:24 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:25:38 It's 1000 meters
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:26:45 Just know that Km/h is around like Plane Crazy's S/h
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:27:05 Then you divide the Km/h for like 1.6 I think
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:27:23 oh yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:27:32 I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:27:37 I'm used with Kilometers
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:28:03 There is a calculator in Windows that can do it
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:28:39 Around this number.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:28:48 0.6 miles per hour
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:30:06 I forgot the length of a football field
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:30:40 Eh, I'm not gonna think on that
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:30:49 But you're right in one thing:
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:31:05 The 0 can either make things smaller or bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:31:13 It depends of where you put it
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:31:25 0.001 or 1000
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:32:19 It's a bit complicated to convert the speed of the game into miles
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:33:10 I heard they are like 5 feet in height
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:33:56 You almost got it
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:34:09 1 block = 7.7 meters
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:34:24 Meters.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:34:48 1 meter is like 3 feet
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:35:11 Almost
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:35:14 A bit smaller
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:35:52 hmmmmm...
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:36:07 Ye
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:36:18 Something like that
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:36:30 oh wait-
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:37:15 Sorry I mispelled
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:37:20 It's 0.7 meters
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:37:22 There.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:37:47 This is Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:37:52 (too)
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:38:01 This is bobox
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:38:22 Surely it is
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:38:39 As a last example, an avarage airplane.
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:38:59 They use to travel in something like 800km/h
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:39:17 Which I believe is like 1400 miles per hour
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:40:03 Getting it to Plane Crazy, would me somthing around 700 studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:40:09 which is **f a s t**
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:40:20 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:40:25 I like life sized cars
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:41:23 Last time I tried a life sized car I ended into a pit
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:42:31 I know that 1 meter is 3.51 studs
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:43:19 This monster
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:44:01 I think it's a plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:46:16 Matty
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:47:41 I heard that Plane Crazy 2 will make able underwater bulidings to have actual air inside
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:49:48 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:49:52 This would be epic
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:49:56 Imagine the possibilities
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:50:14 No no, I'm talking about the new game
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 06:50:49 The first thing I'm gonna do is a underwater railway
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 07:01:21 eh

help 2022-04-08 06:19:46 How can I access the Suggestions channel in here?
help 2022-04-08 06:23:17 Ah...
help 2022-04-08 06:23:33 This is weird to need a high rank to suggest...
help 2022-04-08 06:24:08 I wanted to suggest a feature for people being able to rotate blocks in 360° degrees, or some more than the multiples of 90°
help 2022-04-08 06:25:25 I'm not sure if you can, but if you can and wanna go there suggest this, I would thank
help 2022-04-08 06:25:32 or someone else that can. It's a nice idea to make smooth buildings easier.
help 2022-04-08 06:31:19 Sadly it's not possible to configure a control surface to be toggled down
help 2022-04-08 06:31:48 These people use rotated wings instead, with some midly complicated motor lock system

plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:44:17 Big brain time
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:44:33 I found a way to convert Studs Per Second into Kilometers Per Hour (and meters per second)
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:48:40 Hm?
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:48:51 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:49:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:49:35 What I did:
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:50:14 I made a math of a rule of 3 to see how 200 studs per second would be in meters per second
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:50:34 Knowing that 1 meter is 5 studs, I arranged the values in that X
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:51:00 Multipliyed them, and then got the final result that was 5M = 200
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:51:11 which means that M is 5 times 200
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:51:19 A.k.a M is 40.
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:51:26 That is meters per second
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:51:54 To make it kilometers per second, you just need to multiply again, but this time by 3.6
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:52:25 The final result is that Plane Crazy's 200 studs per second is actually 144 kilometers per hour.
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:53:30 You just need to use the speed coeficient that I created above there
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:53:37 which is 0.2
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:53:53 500 x **0.2** = 100
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:54:15 100m/s x 3.6 (to kilometers) = 360km/h
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:54:52 This is very useful to create more realistic airplanes
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:55:15 Most planes would take off from at least 220 studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:55:59 10 meters per second
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:56:04 Basically gravity's speed.
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:56:37 That is a heck of a fast boy
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:57:05 Thank you. ^-^
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:57:31 Oh and
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:57:41 I also put there the coeficient for scales
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:58:00 Portuguese
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:58:41 Observation: the scale is based considering that 3 blocks = 2.5 meters
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:58:56 For easy, 1 Plane Crazy block = 0.7 meters
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:59:02 Kinda of
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:59:13 I can understand some stuff that Spanish says, but not everything
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:59:40 This means that in order to get your build to meters, you have to multiply the size by 0.7
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 00:59:55 Let's say a ship that is 150 blocks in lenght.
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:00:13 115.5 meters
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:01:01 This is also useful, because if you think about it, your builds can be better due to the fact that if you consider that 1 block = 1 meter, your builds get very tight
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:01:21 So if you use this new scale, it gets a bit bigger and with more space
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:01:34 👍
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:01:42 Who?
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:04:23 Also also, 144 kilometers per hour is basically 90 miles per hour
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:05:59 Indeed
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:06:10 With K, actually, for some reasson.
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 01:06:25 _im kinda dumb sometimes-_

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:21:44 
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:22:09 I need to ping a staffer to get these dudes, but I can't
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:22:27 I just posted 2 here '-'
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:23:22 I'll try to send it to Discord team then...
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:25:42 Yeah, apperantly there is someone here doing it
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:25:53 the thing is that I can't find their name in the search
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:26:02 so I am assuming it's a bot
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:26:37 I didn't
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:27:04 I'm talking here 'cuz I feel like there is not much of an appropriate channel other than <#623337136267067393> for this
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:27:25 but since I can't ping the staff's ranks, sadly this is what I can do.
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 21:32:23 I managed to send these to obcpro99 now
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:56:34 Here comes story time:
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:57:13 I went to unfold my ship, and that little control surface managed to block it, so I asked the dude to remove it
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:57:29 Comes to me with a "NO" and tries to glitch the ship with a parachute
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:57:49 in the end I blocked him and he blocked me, finally saying the cringest:
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:58:01 "REVENGE BOI"
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:58:14 In conclusion: how do I impeed this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 22:58:27 I mean: is there a way to avoid parachutes to glitch?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:00:05 Wait, how does that makes parachute to unglitch?
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:01:45 It's because I don't know a way to block people from going to your building and abusing the parachute to make the build shake and etc
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:01:56 The blacklist thing doesn't work, sadly.
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:04:14 Welp, shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:05:45 Anyway, thanks for trying to help
plane-crazy 2022-06-18 23:05:51 Have more cringe:

creations-chat 2022-08-02 17:58:38 Do the missles work? (Not torpedoes)
creations-chat 2022-08-02 18:05:43 I can't see a torpedo there but ok-

Other than that, I can say that it is a pretty _t h i c k_ subarime, but add its masts and stuff on top to look more "navy"

[SELECTION TOOL]
[Gameplay]

The idea is about a selection tool what would allow the player to have selected multiple blocks at once, which would make them able to use other tools like the Move tool in a more precise way, like how this tool does in the game Build a Boat for Treasure: (Image 1)

It would be helpful in situations when someone needs to move a large chunk for their construction, be it due to an error or design. Example is this truck which has a even center, something I didn't desire, but could be easily fixed with this tool: (Image 2)

The tool can be a feature in the upcoming Plane Crazy 2.
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 21:48:25 Bruh, I pressed enter while making a suggestion and I accidentaly cut it off

plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:39:01 Or at least I never saw a player doing it.
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:39:38 Yeah, indeed, but surface blocks aren't pushable by players
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:39:57 Unless you make one yourself with blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:40:09 which in this case would also be a control surface, but multiblock.
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 23:41:11 What I can think of are buttons made of blocks that can pull mechanical things with a loose suspension.

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 14:56:40 I might have done Plane Crazy's largest ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:00:35 This has something between 198 blocks and 204 blocks in lenght
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:00:42 I didn't count right 'cuz I'm lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:00:46 4
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:01:01 The cruise ship is my friend's
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:01:35 Honestly I never saw a build that long
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:01:52 Also
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:02:01 I'm thinking about the volume too, not just overall lenght
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:02:38 How long is this?
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:02:43 In blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:03:10 mmmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:03:28 I remember that my bulk carrier is about the same distance as the baseplates to the grass
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:03:41 but this one seems just a little bit more lenghtier indeed
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:03:54 I'm impressed, how did they do it?
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:04:56 Give a diamond to whoever this guy is

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:09:07 Because you have space for it.
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:09:21 Now make a 25 wide ship and 200 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 15:09:26 then we talk

plane-crazy 2023-04-02 17:51:17 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 18:02:13 Sometimes I think Roblox moderators are just bored and looking for something to do
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 18:02:17 so it ends like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:35:58 X-ray'd the classic version of Golfinho
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:43:07 That. Is. Staring at my soul.
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:43:51 I lost hope on waiting for PC2 to come soon, but when it finally arrive, I have some planned things to do in it
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:44:12 I'm a ship guy, so I'll start making even bigger ships
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 19:44:38 Since the map will be an island, vessels will be able to actually work and do their job, instead of being limited to a "lake" as how it is currently.
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:23:43 yea it is
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:23:53 Maybe not even an ocean, just an avarage-sized lake
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:26:06 Also, the floor is like 2 plots deep or less
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:26:33 It will be infinite, but I'm not sure about the depth
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:26:47 Maybe it will become deeper as you get further from the island
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:26:56 or maybe it will have a constant depth at a certain point
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:28:18 Probably the thing mentioned about water not getting inside builds some way won't happen
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:28:39 because it would work more for pre-existing builds that are not made of removable parts
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:30:01 More than half of the lag of a ship comes from the contact of water, because:

1-) Water goes through the blocks and hits all of its surfaces, not only the visible ones
2-) The game has to calculate every single block's influence on the new watery envoroment
3-) Has also to simulate the friction
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:30:38 If in Plane Crazy 2 we can just use a single big streched block to make the side of a hull, these factors will come down severarly
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:30:59 even more so if the water won't actually be terrain water, but instead a custom one
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 20:37:24 When a game improves Roblox more than Roblox themselves. 💀
help 2023-04-12 20:51:12 I need help to make a custom paddlewheeler, what would be the motor speed numbers to make this symetrical when I hold the button to activate them both in the angular motor lock?
help 2023-04-12 20:59:48 They are too small for this ship/boat
help 2023-04-12 21:00:03 The water wheel is just 3x3
help 2023-04-12 21:36:41 hm...
help 2023-04-12 21:39:16 Currently it is reaching an unimpressive speed of _5km/h_
help 2023-04-12 21:39:45 I'm not using water proppellers or any kind of propulsion other than the wheels themselves, which is what I want
help 2023-04-12 22:15:13 I tried
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 17:45:51 oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 17:46:01 Ok but, how can I report?
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 17:46:23 It's locked...
plane-crazy 2023-04-25 17:48:47 bruh
bug-reports 2023-05-06 22:26:47 And I was about to report this same bug now
bug-reports 2023-05-06 23:02:57 I made some observations:

This bug only happens when you use the jetpack for the second time, and it slowly makes you ascend when it is actually being active
bug-reports 2023-05-06 23:25:06 I don't
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:38:05 This is a very toxic behavior, ngl
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:41:07 So, I was casually flying around my creation with some friends, and _this_ happened. I asked them if this has happened with them before, and they agreed
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:41:39 Not sure when this started to happen, though... But it usually happens when you are with a jetpack for a certain amount of time, say about 10 minutes of flying around or with the jetpack not being used.
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:52:56 Not about you, tho
bug-reports 2023-05-15 21:53:11 Just that one guy above that I'm not gonna mention directly
bug-reports 2023-05-15 22:01:26 _Shhh...._ 🤫
bug-reports 2023-05-15 22:01:56 Anyway, there is my bug. If someone knows that this is a Roblox side bug instead, let me know.
bug-reports 2023-05-17 01:44:38 Indeed
