help 2019-07-07 12:16:25 The rotor blades are and tail rotors are all equal and its rotor position is fine.
help 2019-07-07 12:16:44 Not sure if its symmetrical but the front is definitely heavier than the back, is that the cause?
help 2019-07-07 12:39:19 Once I take off, it leans forward and then backward.
help 2019-07-07 12:39:39 Then it just goes backward and forward like a viking ship in an amusement park.
help 2019-07-08 09:46:55 <@!435464209677942784> Oh, thanks! I haven't tested it out but, big thanks!
help 2019-07-08 09:47:31 <@!397830363247804417> Its more of the sky-crane from Unturned, but I can see the similarities, maybe the developer based it off the Lego set?
help 2019-07-08 09:48:11 Big thnx again, I couldn't find a fix and was racking my brain for weeks.
help 2019-07-11 08:07:30 If it is too heavy on one side itl always tilt.
help 2019-07-11 08:07:44 It has to be near-perfectly balanced. Maybe try adding counter weights on another side?
help 2019-07-16 07:46:53 What does the lock function in the motor do?
help 2019-07-16 07:54:39 Oh, I guess I'm technically brain dead. Big thnx!
help 2019-08-17 01:22:39 Is there no back piece to the pontoons?
