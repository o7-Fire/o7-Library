general 2020-05-14 08:52:44 I think the speakers should be free
general 2020-05-14 08:52:52 Hello. I was wondering if you could make the speakers free because I think it’s a bit of a rip off to have a block that costs robux and is not free. It would be really good if it was free. Thanks. I said this to the creator
general 2020-05-14 08:52:55 why?
general 2020-05-14 08:53:15 but what if there is a mute button?

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:49:24 I’m not suggesting this but i’m just saying.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:49:26 Imagine if rickje added preset helicopter rotors.. Like the propellers (large rotor would have 8 blades) (rotor would have 4) (small rotor would have 2)
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:50:26 It would be easier to have them instead of having to make the rotors.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:51:15 Yeah but the configuration and the mass and lift and things are really hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:52:45 Stuka spitfire lmao
