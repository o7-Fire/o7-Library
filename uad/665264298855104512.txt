The Tale of mr_v.nilla (665264298855104512)
general 2020-07-18 14:52:45 Can someone tell me how I suggest stuff cause I don't have permission to talk in <#507673335816126509>
general 2020-07-18 14:53:04 Bruh, I'm new
general 2020-07-18 14:53:09 Deal with it
general 2020-07-18 14:53:15 Thanks.
bot-central 2020-07-18 14:53:24 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-07-18 14:53:47 ?rhelp
general 2020-07-18 14:56:46 Can I just suggest something here and one of you can do the suggestion command for me?
general 2020-07-18 14:58:19 Suggestion: Take the realism of the weight of the aircrafts away or make it so that I can atleast make a Aircraft Carrier with a Plane on it and it doesn't affect the Plane.
general 2020-07-18 14:58:52 Alright.
general 2020-07-18 15:00:51 But that's not what I mean. When I build the Aircraft Carrier it's obviously heavy, and then when I fly then plane that I built with the Aircraft Carrier it makes the Plane heavier that it was usually. That's what I mean by it.
general 2020-07-18 15:01:40 Alright.
general 2020-07-18 15:01:49 But not for me though
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 15:21:54 <@195253906333368320> This is what I mean. And I know it's a part of the game, it's just annoying to me https://youtu.be/TlwFNEODB8I

plane-crazy 2020-07-18 15:23:53 Yea, but u don't have to be so rude about it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 11:31:28 <@551870787980886041> It could be a APC

creations-chat 2020-08-22 08:58:17 But what bugs me is that GamerThailand is making money from those tutorials so he deserves to get all his acc's banned and he doesn't even give credit

creations-chat 2020-08-22 09:00:52 Then you'll start making great stuff, I promise
creations-chat 2020-08-22 09:01:21 It's because the plane is too heavy <@707867360387792938>
creations-chat 2020-08-22 09:02:28 Then remove some weight and add a few helium block to make it float

Try to extend the front a little bit or shorten the back and extend the front
creations-chat 2020-09-27 09:32:28 ?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 09:33:31 Omg I just saw you said T34

creations-chat 2020-11-15 09:58:54 Yea use pontoons, but put it out wide. So basically on the bottom of the boat build horizontal poles where u put pontoons on the end of it and it might help.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 10:00:58 Or u could just put Helium blocks on the heavy side but I don't suggest wasting your time on that
creations-chat 2020-11-15 10:02:44 Alright.
