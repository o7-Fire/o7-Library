plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:32:50 when putting control surfaces in the nose u do it vertically right
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:33:13 also in hover engines u should put drag to 0 right
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 00:33:25 what settings should u use for hover engines in general tbh

help 2021-06-24 01:12:18 so my plane is having trouble going up and down fast enough, rn its pretty slow. i have control surfaces in the nose but their w cuz someone told me to put them that way
help 2021-06-24 01:12:59 also my thrusters are w and s but i do barrel roles with a and d, so i control the turning most of the time with my mouse
help 2021-06-24 01:13:03 anyone got tips
help 2021-06-24 04:06:57 nice man
help 2021-06-24 04:08:42 sorry i thought the mechanics were good
help 2021-06-24 17:07:55 so i see people with all these planes that can go up and down and do barrel roles really fast, how do i do that lol
help 2021-06-24 17:08:15 i can do barrel roles with my plane and stuff but idk if i have the right controls
help 2021-06-24 17:08:55 w and s is my rocket thrust, a and d makes me do barrel roles and i have glitch mouse so i control it most of the time with my mouse
help 2021-06-24 17:09:27 however i feel like it would be easier to control without the mouse, but that also means i cant look around me so is there a fix to that

creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:25:05 suspension powered tnt cannon, i think u can make it in low block count if u use ropes to hold the suspension back but idk the game mechanics that great
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:27:09 this is similar to the tnt idea but how bout a knife where if u press a button it just launches itself in (but still stays attached to the robot lol) ; or maybe a drill that saws from the inside? (i;e spinning cutter)

help 2021-08-26 00:52:44 maybe disconnecters but judging on how small u need those emojis it prob not helpful
help 2021-08-26 01:30:30 ive been noticing that alot of youtubers who have REALLY stable planes (like u can fly upside down without tilting down) use only rockets alot of the time, should i start using those instead of hover drives?
help 2021-08-26 01:30:47 i painted a triangle red in one of my builds fuck u mean
help 2021-08-26 01:30:52 a star too
help 2021-08-26 01:31:05 ik u cant paint every emoji but u can def paint atleast some of them
help 2021-08-26 01:31:21 mainly ones that are sort of outlines instead of whole emojis
help 2021-08-26 01:40:12 can i atleast have tips for stability then
help 2021-08-26 01:40:23 but i still want a reason as to why they use rockets instead of hover drives
help 2021-08-26 01:41:26 ohh
help 2021-08-26 01:41:46 do u mean cover more area with wings or motorlock wings into the same place?
help 2021-08-26 01:41:51 dont wanna confuse them
help 2021-08-26 01:42:40 yep but then when i speed up to max speed (1200 or somethin like that, shakes at 1050) it goes upwards
help 2021-08-26 01:42:52 :/
help 2021-08-26 01:43:08 well it does shake and i do think it lags a bit
help 2021-08-26 01:44:10 ty
help 2021-08-26 01:44:22 yeah usually i sit at 800-900 lol
help 2021-08-26 01:45:08 also dont wanna be more of a problem but can u answer this please
help 2021-08-26 01:45:21 because i dont just wanna add more wingpsan that would be unrealistic
help 2021-08-26 01:45:27 yeah i think its those

help 2021-08-26 01:46:31 ty again

help 2021-08-26 02:35:20 i like it but the gun on top might wanna be a different texture
help 2021-08-26 02:38:18 tbh probably
help 2021-08-26 02:38:51 off topic rn but is there a good way to base a block off of when looking at plane blueprints
help 2021-08-26 02:39:03 like the landing gear should be a 1x1
help 2021-08-26 02:39:12 or a the wings should be a certain length
help 2021-08-26 02:39:20 yeah thats also true
help 2021-08-26 02:50:39 yall think 30 blocks is good for a fw 109? i divided the blueprints into 15 parts (the landing gear width as one part, landing gear wheel = 1 block) but it looked too small so i doubled it to 30 (now landing gear wheel is 2x2 cylinder)
help 2021-08-26 02:51:01 representation
help 2021-08-26 02:52:52 didnt notice that in the background üíÄ

help 2021-08-26 02:55:10 ik but its just neat to see cool landing gears
help 2021-08-26 02:55:23 just a matter of details
help 2021-08-26 02:56:02 also can u answer the question about plane scale its ok if u dont lol
help 2021-08-26 02:56:50 wym it wont shoot?
help 2021-08-26 02:56:57 do u mean cuz theres no hole in the middle or
help 2021-08-26 02:57:01 u can just make a custom cylinder

help 2021-08-26 02:59:23 and they dont attach to the sides so no need to worry about welding

help 2021-08-26 03:13:49 yeah but isnt that where the exposed motors come from???
help 2021-08-26 03:14:02 so if u motorlock those motors to hide them dont you just have more exposed motors
help 2021-08-26 03:14:12 nvm imma go take a shower
help 2021-08-26 03:42:53 i just thought the landing gears were neat?
help 2021-08-26 03:42:59 i didnt say the tut was nice
help 2021-08-26 03:43:09 didnt even know it was a tut i thought they were just bad at building lol
help 2021-08-26 03:43:40 and i will confirm i deleted the message saying it was neat but thats cuz people like you get mad for the slightest of reasons

plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:43:37 ty to you too
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:57:32 i feel like they should make motors have no weight but idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 21:57:56 and also text blocks have weight?? messed up one of my mini builds

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 19:26:04 like if the landing gear can go across the plane 13 times boom plane 13 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 19:27:14 same
