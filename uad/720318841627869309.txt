help 2021-06-23 10:14:49 interesting how 1% of the planes actually keep the known advice to keep your center of mass and wings perfectly inside each other.
general 2021-06-23 10:19:01 6am then 645 am
general 2021-06-23 10:20:09 also running out of jetpack fuel
general 2021-06-23 10:20:16 that can kill too
general 2021-06-23 10:22:38 Me remembering wedge beams exist:
general 2021-06-23 10:36:42 wich two 2X5 water jets my aircraft carrier goes at 4 SPS
general 2021-06-23 10:36:44 nice
general 2021-06-23 10:39:36 wrong. it was 4.5 sps
added two more and now i go at 9
general 2021-06-23 10:39:49 very much faster
general 2021-06-23 10:42:08 can we submit a build that uses ballast blocks that were configured to minimum ballast?
general 2021-06-23 10:42:27 to make it lighter thank u
general 2021-06-23 10:42:57 but the rule of using blocks instead of beams to increase block count
general 2021-06-23 11:13:54 Time to submit my plane carrier
