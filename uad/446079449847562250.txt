general 2020-11-03 07:08:43 Some times I just go into public servers in a red white and blue monster truck playing loud patriotic music while ramping everybody's builds..
general 2020-11-03 07:11:07 It's called a public PvP servet..
general 2020-11-03 07:11:40 Guaranteed to have lag machines and shredders everywhere or your money back free..

bug-reports 2020-11-04 14:44:16 My trap doors wont open when I click them..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 14:44:48 Also, the motor 2 tends to fling me randomly..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:13:56 No..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:14:56 It flung me so bad that i couldn't do anything besides look around then instantly die and have my build explode everywhere when it flings..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:16:01 I ended up fixing the build by replacing it with a normal motor..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:24 Well, it was attached to a cannon on my ship..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:39 I had the speed set to 2.1
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:17:56 About 5 or 6 blocks long..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:18:13 A single motor..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:18:50 I've also had a problem recently where my suspension spasms all the time..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:17 And sometimes it flings me..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:33 I barely managed to get it to work on a truck..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:19:55 Which build?
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:20:16 Ok..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:21:02 Since I dont have discord setup on my laptop I have to download the image to my Google drive, so hold on..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:24:57 Ok
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:04 
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:35 Those motors behind the suspension were from an older versiin to try to stop it..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:25:40 Version..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:05 And it drives but still violently bounces..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:10 Ive tried that..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:26:25 It made it worse..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:14 I just recently added more width to the wheel after testing everything..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:33 I even had help trying to fix it from my friends..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:27:56 I think ive got it the best i could..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:24 Like i said ive basically tried all i could..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:49 I spent an entire day fixing it..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:28:57 ...
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:29:16 Why would you use jjsploit?
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:29:39 Its unsafe, plus its almost made to get you detected..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:30:56 I used to mess around with an animation gui in the game and crawl through 1 block spaces..
bug-reports 2020-11-04 15:31:22 Lol
bug-reports 2020-11-05 16:18:55 Never trust free exploits..
general 2020-11-23 11:15:56 Is there a chat for cursed images?
general 2020-11-23 11:17:16 Does an angry German that started ww2 with an anime pillow count as nsfw if it doesn't have any angry German shapes?
general 2020-11-23 11:18:21 It's a younger image of him in shorts with the symbols covered..
general 2020-11-23 11:19:45 It's in the dump..
general 2020-11-23 11:22:29 I know of a channel that started in like 2012 for a children's player base and is still going with the 40 year old owner still acting like a child..
general 2020-11-23 11:22:44 He even uses face cam..
general 2020-11-23 11:24:22 Is it wrong to harass somebody that's stealing other peoples work?

general 2020-11-24 21:27:24 I have a question..
general 2020-11-24 21:27:42 How much money would it cost to buy 9080 robux?
general 2020-11-24 21:29:10 ...
general 2020-11-24 21:30:24 I tried to Google how much it costs but all I got was some scam websites, some websites that redirect you to scams, and broken converters..
general 2020-11-24 21:30:34 ...
general 2020-11-24 21:33:07 You sure?
general 2020-11-24 21:33:40 Because apparently 100 dollars is 10000 robux
general 2020-11-24 21:34:16 Do i trust reddit or this?
general 2020-11-24 21:34:33 WHO DO I TRUST!?
general 2020-11-24 21:35:18 Who am I supposed to trust?
general 2020-11-24 21:35:54 Seems broken..
general 2020-11-24 21:37:03 So it's gonna be like 100 bucks for 9080, correct?
general 2020-11-24 21:37:34 91
general 2020-11-24 21:37:54 Because I can buy 80 robux for 99
general 2020-11-24 21:38:02 So 91..
general 2020-11-24 21:38:52 Now i just have to wait another two months to get back to work, then I have to make the money, and then I have to buy a visa card and then I can buy it..
general 2020-11-24 21:40:07 I dont have access to my bank account until I'm 17..
general 2020-11-24 21:40:51 I have one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in there that i cant use for multiple years..
general 2020-11-24 21:41:16 Yes..
general 2020-11-24 21:41:25 One hundred and twenty thousand..
general 2020-11-24 21:41:50 Do you know how much it hurts to know you have that much but can't use it?
general 2020-11-24 21:42:14 It's supposed to go to a house, college, and a car..
general 2020-11-24 21:42:54 I have one hundred and twenty thousand in that account but yet I can barely afford knockoff pizza rolls..
general 2020-11-24 21:43:35 I do shop once a month..
general 2020-11-24 21:45:10 Speaking of pots, my grandmother is making food, should I help her?
general 2020-11-24 21:45:20 Ok..
general 2020-11-24 21:45:30 I'll be back soon..
general 2020-11-25 22:41:13 Made cornbread and pumpkin pie with my grandmother the other day..
general 2020-11-25 22:41:26 Also, I'm sinning..
general 2020-11-25 22:42:11 I just ordered pizza with pineapple on it.
general 2020-11-25 22:42:20 ...
general 2020-11-25 22:42:28 Same..
general 2020-11-25 22:42:56 And almost every time i do that it's with a build that i planned on being my biggest..
general 2020-11-25 22:43:13 And usually is the biggest I've built yet..
general 2020-11-25 22:43:42 I'll have like a small section left and then give up, usually deleting it..
general 2020-11-25 22:44:01 ...
general 2020-11-25 22:46:49 I was skateboarding all day and i feel as if my back is giving out and half of my foot is broken..
general 2020-11-25 22:47:06 ...
general 2020-11-25 23:26:24 Apparently it takes an hour to make and deliver my god damn pizza..
general 2020-11-25 23:26:39 As I pressed the enter button my doorbell rang..
general 2020-11-25 23:26:44 Here it is..
general 2020-11-25 23:26:51 Gonna be completely cold..

general 2020-11-25 23:47:01 *fish
general 2020-11-26 13:35:50 I think I might have actually broke my foot..
general 2020-11-26 14:27:35 Yesterday I was skateboarding, and when pushing off at really high speeds I twisted my foot then it hit the ground really hard then I fell backwards landed on my board, my board ran over my foot, then I slid off of the board and slammed into the ground, and now it hurts so bad that when I put any pressure on the part that hurts it hurts so bad that i almost yell..
general 2020-11-26 14:29:02 I can control my foot just fine..
general 2020-11-26 14:29:26 But when I put pressure on the area under my big toe where it got ran over it hurts really bad..
general 2020-11-26 14:29:53 And I've broken both of my arms and it feels almost just like those did..
general 2020-11-26 17:48:00 Is it wrong that when somebody keeps spawn killing me in pvp i make a turret and cover it in explosive blocks so it cant be destroyed and kill them until they give up?
general 2020-11-26 17:49:15 Pvp is complete cancer but somehow its still fun..
general 2020-11-26 17:50:47 I still havent learned how to motorlock..
general 2020-11-26 17:51:10 ...
general 2020-11-26 17:51:40 Also, im so bad at building that i dont even have a use for it..
general 2020-12-08 22:58:45 Help me, i cant stop playing titanfall 2, I'm addicted..
general 2020-12-10 17:17:23 My laptop has 3 usb ports and i only use one for my mouse, i also have a usb hub with 4 ports, so now I'm tempted to buy a bunch of usb sticks to see how much extra storage I can get..
general 2020-12-10 17:18:14 ...
general 2020-12-10 17:40:59 Now I'm wondering if i could stack usb hubs and use usb sticks on them infinitely to get an infinite amount of storage..
general 2020-12-10 17:41:30 I would still like to try..
general 2020-12-10 17:42:33 Can somebody do some math for me?

general 2020-12-29 01:26:38 I dont really care about the drive by because it was most likely a crack head who scammed a dealer, i mainly care about my pizza..
general 2020-12-31 16:48:24 Don't you just love the sound of two gun shots then like 15 police cars zooming by with lights and sirens?

general 2021-03-09 05:09:19 Rotor on long pole, slot through center of heli, rotor angle into the slot and face forward, VTOL.
