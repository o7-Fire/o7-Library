general 2021-09-05 04:52:36 PA-120
creations-chat 2021-12-05 02:04:05 There's a lot I want to do such as Christmas lights more color to the outside and I need to finish two rooms in the back. So its still undergoing its Reno
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:18:20 <@!690957737391161434>  sheesh I see you have made Minecraft 1.18 come to Roblox
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:21:21 what is the little thing in the last one?
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:26:34 well the lighting and color blending is outstanding!
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:33:25 <@!690957737391161434>  ngl that looks like a different game entirely
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:36:02 DwAyNe??
creations-chat 2021-12-06 01:41:13 yeee
general 2021-12-07 22:52:22 anyone wanna do a 4WD 3speed drag build challenge?
general 2021-12-07 22:52:38 nothing but motors
creations-chat 2021-12-22 23:24:33 its all I build
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:05:55 did you not notice of I said a Plane Crazy Version and how I put Engine in quotations? I was not claiming anything, I had just made a thing that moves based off of how a general engine layout (meaning the drive and power of the "Engine" comes from the front end of the vehicle.) That is what I was thinking. Now have a good day üôÇ
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:08:58 well thank you for the insight, I'll be sure to better word what I say next time thanks for the feedback!
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 22:43:51 it sure does
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 22:44:03 thats how i lined it up
plane-crazy 2022-03-11 22:46:29 it uses pistons to lift it off the ground and propellers to turn. so technically no the wheels dont turn.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 05:59:11 <@520835790486503434> its equivalent to a 1.4L H4 XD
creations-chat 2022-08-21 06:05:28 <@520835790486503434> its too weak to actually cause any server issues. However it is a really weak engine. The F8c 16cb Engine should be much more powerful üôÇ
creations-chat 2022-08-21 06:08:18 its made to look and feel more like a real engine. i have one that i made a shell for but ran into the problem of it being to weak to push the damn car. so im redesigning it to somehow be better.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 06:10:23 true but i already played around with that when i made my 4 speed Manual Drag cars
creations-chat 2022-08-31 05:59:55 whoops my bad. thx for the feedback tho mate!
