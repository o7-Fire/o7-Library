general 2022-12-04 21:41:22 Hi
general 2022-12-04 21:44:44 What happened to the builds area?
bug-reports 2022-12-05 10:56:02 There is a bug with the rails where if you spawn close to the station your train won't drive but when you spawn at other railway locations tge train drives
bot-central 2022-12-22 02:23:29 -servers
general 2023-01-02 06:11:55 <@217336009455566848> can we have a way larger track network aswell and with more realistic corners
general 2023-01-02 06:12:24 Maybe standard and narrow gauge
