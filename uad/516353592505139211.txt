general 2021-03-29 20:28:53 I have a mothership that is nearly 5k blocks that i want to show. It has 3 hangar bays, 2 story interior, lighting, 5 light cruisers, 2 destroyers, and they are all armed and individually controlled.

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 03:11:54 rblx physics plus piston is never a good story lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 03:12:35 but all jokes aside pistons are not that bad

general 2021-07-21 06:39:09 d a m n
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 21:00:56 As of the announcement of plane crazy 2, does anyone know if the game will run better than plane crazy 1?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 21:01:46 Yeah, yesterday's announcements sure made the game look super appealing too
general 2021-08-29 01:16:44 yoooo japanese transformers is sick
general 2021-10-05 00:02:45 okok id like to keep it that way
general 2021-11-08 03:11:20 I don't mean to be this kind of guy to ask the same question as everyone, but does anyone know a general estimation for the release date of PC2?
general 2021-11-13 00:06:59 I can't believe I got my hopes up high and got rickrolled after seeing a supposed plane crazy teaser by rickje. that and the fact that I bought battlefield 2042 for early access just so some "Gold" version comes out for an even earlier pass for today
general 2021-11-22 19:27:05 how can I post photos in <#384025409945337856> ? I want to be able to show off something
general 2021-11-22 19:28:53 so I level up by chatting or something?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 19:32:19 honestly I wouldn't mind if pc2 is delayed. from what I hear about server size increase and performance gains it seems all worth it
general 2022-01-22 00:34:26 I haven't played in a while or been on this server, though last I heard, PC 2 was supposed to release in early 2022. Have there been any ingame events, teasers or leaks hyping up a final product or?
general 2022-01-22 00:37:00 february seems too early IMO. After all we are basically taking the games fanbase funding, using that to basically make a backwards compatible revamp and optimize a game.
general 2022-01-22 00:37:08 dope dude
general 2022-01-22 00:37:18 what specs you got for your laptop?
general 2022-01-22 00:38:16 nice I was looking into a laptop myself once I get my systems crypto mining. I build, buy, and sell pcs for a side hustle so right now I'm looking to crypto mine each one to pay off the price to make an excess more in profits
general 2022-01-22 00:38:24 good stuff brabus
general 2022-01-22 00:39:20 hell yeah, though honestly I don't mind maintenence on laptops
general 2022-01-22 00:39:33 my dad knows the fun way that dell laptops are dog sh-
general 2022-01-22 00:39:51 so he got a new one
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 00:43:36 I don't get why my control panels wont work
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 00:43:39 they don't bend
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:44:59 My control panels won't work
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:48:59 dont work
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:53:44 like when im spawned in or even if its  just a free falling control panel wing, it wont follow my cursor and it stands still
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:55:57 sure
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:57:36 
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:58:20 I did get a new mouse and keyboard but i doubt thats the issue at all
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:58:29 main pilot seat is a level down from the folding pieces
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:58:50 ayyyy
bug-reports 2022-01-28 00:58:54 here lemme try moving
bug-reports 2022-01-28 01:01:32 so is that part of like a new update? I don't remember it being relative to main seats before
bug-reports 2022-01-28 01:58:12 same
general 2022-03-05 19:15:00 when does it come out tho? Pretty interested in searching the map honestly
general 2022-03-05 19:15:15 lol how did they manage to get banned on that
general 2022-03-05 19:16:14 dang
general 2022-03-05 19:17:09 I wish you could tune the phone's power draw like undervolt and such. I don't need 20-30 percent more performance per year if the battery life is barely increasing
general 2022-03-05 19:17:36 wow does it include my zfold 3?
general 2022-03-05 19:17:46 lmao
general 2022-03-05 19:18:34 yeah it was just sort of a quick thought I had
general 2022-03-05 19:19:15 wasn't there a feature before when you jailbroke older samsungs to tune it with 3rd party
general 2022-03-05 19:19:55 I'm no expert at jailbreaking but it still would be cool to see what we can actually do
general 2022-03-05 19:20:23 do you mean throttling the apps as in underclocking the phone for the applications?
general 2022-03-05 19:21:03 I have a loyalty plan with my phone so I don't want to screw anything up for the next 3 years ðŸ‘€
general 2022-03-05 19:21:26 yeah we have something like that too on samsungs.
general 2022-03-05 19:21:31 true
general 2022-03-05 19:22:33 Is linux even stable on phones? Because if so I would like to try some gaming on that down the line. I'll do my own research when the time comes
general 2022-03-05 19:24:21 can't wait to run crisis on my phone
general 2022-03-05 19:24:58 The folding screen is awesome. I don't really want a tablet but having something like that for movies or multitasking or drawing is a dream
general 2022-03-05 19:25:43 I only got it because the loyalty plan brought down the price by 800 dollars so it was a lot more reasonable. Dex is great too as I get to stream my movies to families tv's when we meetup
general 2022-03-05 19:27:09 honestly if I was more of a photographer I would strive for sony's like xperia 3 or whatever
general 2022-03-05 19:27:50 Because when you take still photos with that huge sensor it is amazing what they can do. Sadly they do cut off the sensor so it doesn't utilize the full  1 inch but its fine
general 2022-03-05 19:28:18 wait what model phone do you have? Because Samsung note 9 and up I believe can do this wirelessly
general 2022-03-05 19:28:52 I wish samsung did better on their monitors though. I want a brighter panel than that of like 250 nits or whatever the spec was.
general 2022-03-05 19:29:35 true, but integration with a phone is key for me. I don't really want to carry it around if its not gonna be in my pocket
general 2022-03-05 19:30:20 That's what I'm saying though. If it's not in my phone, it's probably not in my pocket
general 2022-03-05 19:31:57 True, though photography isn't my thing. It's mainly capturing the moment like family events. If I had more use for a camera I would definitely point my budget towards that end of the camera spectrum, but like I can make due with my phone's camera
general 2022-03-05 19:32:56 nice, I remember seeing the a80, with the flip camera and thinking it was such a neat thing for the price
general 2022-03-05 19:33:42 Like zooming in  on trips or through plane windows. Honestly it is a push in the right direction since capturing more detail and such within a photo is definitly better than the other incremental upgrades they've been giving per year
general 2022-03-05 19:35:44 Dang I wish I could post photos here but even my phone takes nice photos. the jump to a dslr isn't really worth it for me
general 2022-03-05 19:37:27 True but I just mean that if my phone's good enough I'm not gonna put my budget in one. I'm definitely convinced the difference is huge though, just trying to manage my money better though atm
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 03:55:07 Pc 2
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:25:36 I hate to be that guy and ask, but just curious to anyone who knows out there, when will pc 2 come out?
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:26:53 lastest message back in march in the development channel says that it was planned for summer, which i know the answer to that, just curious to see if there were any mentions outside of this channel that shows off  the expected release
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 07:06:08 Do half beams weigh half as much as normal beams
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:48:14 is it true that pc2 launches september 22nd?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:48:20 I heard it from someone in my server
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 01:49:32 ah I see, thanks for the update
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 15:56:39 Lmao is this real?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:13:53 I mean it just seems kind of like a stupid thing to get reported for. I see other people asking for mods or creators to come back more often to make the servers seem more lively and not dead and it's viewed as respect or sum
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:14:35 it's like you like a server so much you just want it to be active or not die out. but who knows, we are bound to get reported for anything nowadays
the-dump 2022-11-13 02:34:30 
the-dump 2022-11-13 02:35:09 
the-dump 2022-11-13 03:11:15 thas hot dude
general 2022-11-27 17:46:42 why riot against him
general 2022-11-27 17:47:33 wait thats actually kind of smart
general 2022-11-27 17:47:51 how much is it if I want to buy a status report of the game
general 2022-11-27 17:48:10 yeah Honestly I doubt it too
general 2022-11-27 17:48:36 I'm betting he would just accept in games donations even if the dev pay is lowered a lot by roblox platform cuts
creations-chat 2022-12-02 17:35:23 Dude it would be so sick to see some transformer builds
creations-chat 2022-12-02 17:46:45 Oh ok ty for the tip
general 2022-12-26 01:05:35 Merry Christmas yall
creations-chat 2023-02-23 18:26:06 Long time since I played but this was my mother ship with full interior and its fleet I called "Contour"
creations-chat 2023-02-23 18:28:50 It's alright, I want to make another one when plane crazy 2 comes out because it's not that good when it comes to the small details. Like people have such insane motor locking and mine just isn't that impressive anymore
creations-chat 2023-02-23 23:16:09 I love the concept, the front of the ship is very futuristic and the hue is nice!
For a first ship this is impressive and you should keep up at it
