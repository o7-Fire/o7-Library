The Tale of qlskipper (310554419030917121)
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:22:37 To lock a motor to prevent it from moving I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:22:52 It locks and unlocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:22:54 I think
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:22:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:00 It does
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:08 Wasn‚Äôt fine meshing the old ‚Äúmotorlock‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:13 Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:25 Just don‚Äôt move it
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:23:29 It locks when it‚Äôs not moving
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:24:00 It doesn‚Äôt lock until it‚Äôs reset
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:24:19 Basically it locks in the reset position but doesn‚Äôt lock outside of that I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:24:26 You can always experiment if you‚Äôre unsure
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 15:24:36 Don‚Äôt take that advice outside of plane crazy tho

creations-chat 2021-05-22 16:59:47 Land Rover Defender d110. what should I change? 

edit: oml I forgot about slow mode. Based off of the RC car mostly (Traxxas TRX-4 Defender), and others the real thing. I'll send an image of the RC car when slowmode is gone.
creations-chat 2021-05-22 17:01:53 This is a picture of the RC. Feedback? Sorry for small size.
general 2021-05-22 17:02:22 finally I can post in creations feedback
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:03:27 feedback?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:04:13 which part, grille? bumper? both?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:06:07 wdym like, width of the headlights? color?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:06:13 protruding too much?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:08 they are a half block back rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:13 unsure how to do less than half
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:24 it is half block
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:27 wait I know
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:30 1x0,9?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:44 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:53 yes thats a half block, so I can motorlock a 1x0,9 block
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:07:58 it would look glitchy then
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:08:18 I'll motorlock a 1x0.9 block to look like a half block and that way I can bring lights back more
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:11:14 would this be too light for the grille?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:11:36 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:18:31 thats why I did a darker color at first
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:18:37 oh I have too much yellow
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:19:44 what is it
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:20:10 wow lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:20:14 hey, if it works right?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:20:34 also heres the new design
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:20:45 right side is fixed headlights
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:20:51 also ignore the gap
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:23:53 im making it solid axle suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:24:02 because who wouldn't anyay
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:24:29 im gonna try and position the motor over the wheel and hope it doesnt look ugly
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:24:47 it looks weird because y'know.. one side steers the other doesn't
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:24:57 I need to add like a differential
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:25:12 rn it looks terrible but it works good enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:28:12 I based it off of my other build
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:29:19 oh hey madattak is online
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:31:08 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:31:36 does well? except for that tilt at the end.. that never happened before
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:35:20 ok im trying to make a genuinely good AE86 but I ended up with.. this.
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:35:29 I am unsure what to change
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:37:45 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:37:50 what about the bottom/front
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:37:56 does it seem off at all?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 17:38:35

plane-crazy 2021-05-22 20:14:06 the links probably look bad but, what could replace the suspension?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 20:14:25 it seems like it wasnt "stretching" enough and when I added the suspension it solved that
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 20:19:52 same
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 21:05:46 here it is so far
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 21:05:48 pog

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:05:49 omfg bro. to any new players on plane crazy, here is a very important tip:

**NEVER RUSH YOUR BUILDS!**
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:06:00 started off good because I took my time
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:06:05 and then it turned into.. that
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:08:08 yeah thats what I tried to do
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:08:11 its not worth it tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:08:19 front was goin okay
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:08:31 then the windshield because I thought "hard part out of the way"
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:08:34 so it got bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:09:48 I mean personally I don't think this is too bad except for the colors
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:09:52 the colors were supposed to be from l4d1 but it didnt end up as I expected
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:19:05 bruh
creations-chat 2021-05-23 05:44:39 is this too steep for an ae86?

plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:31:09 
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:31:09 ok so with bigger wheels it probably looks odd from the front
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:31:18 but from the side it looks better
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:31:25 also ignore the ugly on the right and windshield
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:31:28 thats temporary
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:55:57 fabric text?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:56:19 yeah I only had it blue because I was gonna make the top black but I changed it back for now
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:57:02 yeah, just thought the thought (<:troll:670242390115876891>) of fabric text was funni

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 20:04:18 should the motor be centered in the middle?

creations-chat 2021-06-28 20:49:10 low effort football, how do I make the top better
creations-chat 2021-06-28 20:54:05 yeah I justchangedthat. I used default texture
creations-chat 2021-07-25 19:15:11 brick. needs to be brickier, more aerodynamic maybe. what should I add?
it flies too
supersonic but I can make it faster
creations-chat 2021-07-25 19:32:04 lego, what to improve
same as the brick just a different texture and slightly longer
