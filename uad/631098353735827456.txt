bot-central 2021-04-28 07:51:30 hm yes.
help 2021-04-28 07:55:39 one literally inside the other? or on top of eachother
bot-central 2021-04-28 07:56:28 &suggest A 360 degree turret/motor. Basically, just so we can make more compact builds without having to place two motor2s to be able to have a 360 turret. Could also be useful for decreasing block count on some builds/making small versions of things. eg: jeep with a turret on the top, AH-64 with a detailed gun, Vtol with a chain gun on the front, etc.
bot-central 2021-04-28 07:56:33 now will you work?
help 2021-04-28 07:57:56 Ah, you meant like that.
help 2021-04-28 07:59:20 I'd probably say three 3 ways for this
help 2021-04-28 07:59:43 1. Use half blocks connected to different motors spinning in different directions (probably a little big, might work the best)
help 2021-04-28 08:01:22 2. if you're good enough with motorlocking, you should be able to have the bottom of the ufo (with the smaller rings) connect to the top ufo part (with the bigger rings) or something like that
help 2021-04-28 08:04:03 3. Probably the most simple, but might literally just break everything. Connect those two to unpowered motors and add anything (jets/propellers/rockets, you know) to the sides of it and then the result you got is a spinning ring that might screw everything up
