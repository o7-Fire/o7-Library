plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:31:59 <@!251493349981159436> How'd you make a prop-only helo without it being a quad?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:33:09 Oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:33:16 Contra-rotating prop
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 18:33:18 I see
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:41:04 Anyone got a way to make a gyro?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:41:16 My helo really hates life-ing
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:41:49 Mmm.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:41:57 But my helo is about 200 blocks.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:42:08 I can't really fit a gyro inside
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:42:26 It's not a plane.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:42:35 It's a soviet rocket-based reconnaissance drone.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:42:55 Then what's a helicopter/
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:44:43 the helo is this big
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:44:47 ***Ignore the warfare in the background***
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:46:44 ***Insert SONAR here***
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:50:25 A friend of mine probably
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:50:36 He made a Ratte with a runway built into the back
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:51:04 I clearly build the smallest things ever
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 21:51:14 34 block jet

(I say licensed because if I see someone using it without permission I will shoot them)

(probably nobody wants it anyway)
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 16:58:12 500 plus
plane-crazy 2018-11-14 18:36:07 oh

creations-chat 2018-12-14 20:11:38 Repost, since I haven't got the Inventor rank I requested for the crane, I would like to know why this is if I am not eligible.
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:19:48 Ok, 

I have a question then.

I've submitted multiple vehicles that, by the ranks, are valid for ranking. Why hasn't this happened?
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:20:08 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:20:17 But I did
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:21:08 I have noticed that as soon as I posted them about 20 others appeared from others.

plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:30:26 Ok I just reposted every single thing i've posted
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:32:08 The reposting is taking forever I think I posted too much

plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:33:11 My PC died
creations-chat 2018-12-26 15:33:32 And this is my AAC (Late) on video
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:34:57 Ok yeah my PC died on repost
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:35:04 all it did was repost the writing
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:35:53 Should I maybe repost them in smaller increments AS TO NOT KILL MY PC
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:36:34 Are you sure you didn't misread it the first time?
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:36:40 They both have the same digits.
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:38:05 Also should I retry the repost?
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:38:51 The first one you're level
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:38:56 The second one you're pointing down
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:39:45 phyyyyyyyyyyyyyyysics?
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:39:54 Also put your gear up
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:41:30 I remember when someone called this an X-wing because of the wing format.
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:42:37 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-26 15:50:31 Am I allowed to post a folder of 30 into creations chat as it shouldn't create a mess? (A folder not posting 30 photos) or will it not show in creations?

plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:31:34 How much does a player weigh in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:31:44 I'd rather like to use a ballast to balance my VTOL out
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:34:43 to all players, a chair with a player sat in it weighs 1.25 in a ballast
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:35:30 or it might be weighed in tons
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:35:34 in which case uhh
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:35:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:36:33 might be 1.26 in a ballast
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:36:34 idk
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:37:07 or 1.255
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:37:14 just.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 15:37:19 I'll make a gyroscope.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:10:05 I made a vtol with a gyro that's so weak that it can't make the thing pull up
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:11:00 I mean, it can't roll either
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:11:05 and the roll gyro is the largest one.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:11:40 ***Alright then***
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:12:23 is there like a joint or something that can toggle (in flight) between locked flat and not?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:13:38 I recently (not recently, it was about 3 months ago) made a helicopter expecting it to look cool.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:13:48 For stable flight, the rotor spins once every six seconds.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:16:03 I also made flares.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:16:18 Launches off the top of my ship and (hopefully) tricks missiles.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:22:49 I designed a vehicle specially for inventor, but it's a proof of concept and hence hard to operate (Nobody knows what it's meant to do and I can't get someone lined up properly in a decent plane)
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:23:29 ???
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:23:36 oh the ***?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:23:49 done
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:25:57 did it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:26:12 Oh that's why my VTOL concept works so well now
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:26:15 used to just go to orbit
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:29:09 ***Single engined F-15***
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:29:32 Elevon?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:29:43 It's called an elevon.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:29:59 You've got elevons on the rear, rudders on the rear top and ailerons on the wings
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:30:47 elevons are for delta wings.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:30:48 Ah.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:31:01 "Elevon, the movable part of the trailing edge of a delta wing"
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:31:46 Elevators, "Elevators are flight control surfaces, usually at the rear of an aircraft, which control the pitch"
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:32:39 It's not a "stabilator" either.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:32:50 Yeah, that's a delta wing.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:32:54 I know what a delta wing is.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:32:58 I'm not an idiot.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:33:05 F117 that's a nighthawk.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:33:24 Ugh.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:33:38 Someone made a car with a spinning swastika and drove it around.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:33:55 Canards are only for when it's on the front.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:34:19 Get a million freaking balls
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:34:27 and ***Spam them***
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:34:33 no just spam the balls
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:34:35 they lag to hell
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:35:09 I have experience, a friend of mine made a 1k+ block super bomber using the balls
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:35:16 He's going "400"
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:35:20 it looks like he's going 30.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:35:24 20 frames.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:02 just, all I can say is spam balls everywhere and watch the server go insane.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:11 *Elevators*
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:24 Flaps are on the inner wing to increase wing surface area
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:40 Elevators are the rear wings.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:46 Ailerons are on the outer wing.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:51 Flaps are on the inner wing.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:36:56 Canards are frontal elevators.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:37:01 Rudders are on the top rear.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:37:08 How many times do I need to explain this?
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:37:15 Exactly.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:38:03 Still called elevators...
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:38:46 If you want the name for the TYPE of stabiliser, that would be a vertical stabiliser, but technically, it's an elevator.
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:39:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:39:29 angerify the people
plane-crazy 2019-04-04 16:41:00 Rick, just spam balls and spawn them.
creations-chat 2019-04-04 17:02:42 As previously, nobody understood what I meant by this, I did about 20 tries trying to land a plane into it and finally got it, The plane fell out almost immediately. (Requesting inventor as I believe nobody has designed one of these before) (Video footage coming after the photo)
creations-chat 2019-04-04 17:02:45 
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:08:08 WIP, any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:10:31 tracks are already separated from the body more than originally intended, and the planned extra detail was ERA on the turret and hull, but I have absolutely no idea how that's done (plus it's already heavily motor-locked)
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:13:00 i'm quite new to motor-locking/advanced builds to that level, previously the most i'd motor lock is some wings into a gun on an aircraft but i have ***absolutely no idea how it's done***

the only reason it isn't better is because I don't know how to make it better
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:22:46 don't you love asking for suggestions and just getting "rebuild everything" with no actual explanation on how or what went wrong
very constructive and useful information
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:50:48 very good, lower wing feels slightly too small though
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:55:47 ?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 18:59:32 if you mean by design the size of the wing, super's previously mentioned it's based off the Handley Page HP.42, which has a slightly larger lower wing relative to size
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:05:17 Built my first swashplate helo
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:05:24 
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:05:29 With a couple extra bits…
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:06:01 If you have any advice on making a reasonable swashplate any smaller
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:06:30 This is basically exactly what I made
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:06:42 But heavily simplified
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:06:50 I did use text blocks extensively
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:07:01 Notice how the two rotors aren’t technically attached in several places
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:07:30 The long heli allows me to have an effective tail though
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:07:58 The tail on a contrarotating heli is a counterbalance and a point for adding wings to keep it stable so it’s still necessary
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:08:43 But yeah it’s my first swashplate heli so I could probably fix a few things in the design
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:09:32 One thing I was having an issue with
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:10:02 The rotors were trying to stay upright which caused some almost uncontrollable vibrations when moving controls rapidly
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:10:14 Any idea how to fix that?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:11:41 Issue is technically there’s a split on that red line
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:11:52 So if I rapidly move the controls the rotor floats off of the plate
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:11:57 And I lose control
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:12:23 (The rotor floating off the plate basically increases the blade pitch so it’ll try to force itself back down)
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:12:44 Ah right thanks man
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:13:55 But yeah I’m sure you can imagine contrarotating heli losing control and having unequal torque between the rotors
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:14:22 So it’s about a half second of the heli trying to spin out
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:16:09 Just noticed in the image it’s slightly happening on the top rotor too
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:16:11 
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:16:14 Notice the gap
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:17:33 put engine on truck chassis
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:17:35 truck
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:18:44 I sure hope you’re using that for a tank turret
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:19:03 And I just checked the chat because I’m blind
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:19:05 Indeed you are
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:19:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:19:29 Overengineering: the entire reason games like plane crazy exist
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:20:41 nah but like more overengineering = more fun imo
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:35:28 Yeah that’s the point where I go play DCS for a week and come back to build something completely different
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:35:43 Then remember that design existed a year and a half later and actually redesign it to function
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:36:30 Nah but I like to stay away from gears
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:36:50 If I can I just use wheels with a two bar connection
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:36:58 Less buggy and just works better
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:41:02 Use gears for the legs
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:41:09 To make sure that they’re precisely in sync
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:41:14 Or some sort of other system like a rod
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:41:39 If you have a rod that moves back and forth that can be converted to rotary motion, but then you need a way to have that attach to all four wheels
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:42:29 Or rather legs
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:42:44 Or two legs which is easier to get the gearing set up but harder to keep stable
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:49:57 Well anyone that gets -1FPS deserves the bragging rights
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 04:50:05 Not for the FPS though
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:04:22 About 734 I think
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:04:30 30 days 14 hours
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:06:03 More than a month of gameplay gang
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:06:27 Waiting for plane crazy to beat my hours in ArmA 3
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:06:33 1683… just 900 hours to go
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:07:04 Once you play the milsim you become one with the milsim
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:08:50 But yeah I dunno I spend most of my time in plane crazy building overengineered prototypes that shouldn’t work and generally only barely do
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:09:21 Like that one thrust vectoring fighter that is barely flyable since no flight computers but can perform a perfect cobra without issue
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:54:37 That’s the fun part
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:54:54 Then you remember they existed a year later and continue them but forget the original purpose
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:55:14 I once accidentally turned an MBT into a mobile SAM system because I had a hull and no turret
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:55:24 object 120
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:56:01 One thing I enjoy is ejector seats
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:56:06 I have had a lot of fun with ejector seats
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:56:24 They’ve gotten a lot better since the first one I made to the point that you couldn’t tell the plane had one until I use it
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:57:27 I’m bad at making anything big
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:57:40 Anything that takes more than 4 hours to finish will not be finished for half a year
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:58:18 Also one thing I just can’t comprehend
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:58:25 Vehicles that are completely motor locked or angle locked
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:58:36 I just can’t lay the images over eachother in my head
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:58:47 It looks like the average A-4 after consuming an SA-2
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:58:49 It makes no sense
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:59:24 I’ve done it before and I get how it works but
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 05:59:28 It just hurts my head
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 06:00:01 Most of my vehicles have absolutely no angle locking and very minimal motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 06:00:23 The only motor locking used is really to get blocks completely attached to another block without actually being connected like on my heli
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 06:00:30 …sure?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:29:08 What’s with the rocket nacelles
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:30:24 If you’re gonna do that go all the way
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:30:45 (Totally not CV-6 with 1701 nacelles)
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:31:52 >wood
>giant flames at 2000*C+
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:32:55 True but a rocket is a rocket
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:33:26 Then it’s… probably not made out of wood
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:37:04 Well it can’t be a cybercopter if it’s still clearly turbine
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:37:06 It’s not electric!
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:37:43 No it’s definitely turbine
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:38:00 Can’t all helicopters temporarily run wind powered
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:38:18 It’s called *autorotation*
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:38:43 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:39:01 Trying to make a vehicle which functions on a literal rotating radar magnet stealth to radar
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 07:39:19 That’ll work right?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 14:43:27 It looks horrendous
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:01:13 🤨
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:02:05 What
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:02:08 On earth
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:02:33 How small is that turret then
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:04:19 And what, they both have to try to not have their hand eaten or crushed by the gun?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:04:29 Yes the Abrams is asymmetrical
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:04:32 You didn’t know?
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:04:57 Make a calculator
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:05:03 Just make a mechanical calculator
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:05:20 Even better
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:05:22 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_integrator
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:05:27 oh my god
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:06:00 I feel like I have to correct you there
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:06:06 10₂*
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:06:29 True, true
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:08:40 One pixel out of place
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 15:08:43 That’s a crime
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 00:10:27 real
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 00:11:21 Now it needs an ocean so I can actually viably use a hydrofoil
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 00:13:39 W h a t
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:34:19 And go where?
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:34:26 You’ll fly above water for 2 seconds and then die
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:34:43 Same reason my hydrofoil prototypes failed
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:34:54 They technically worked but also fell off the edge of the ocean too quickly
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:35:02 No they worked fine
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:35:09 It’s just the ocean area is too small
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:35:14 I got one to 320 speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:35:23 But it usually settled in at 240
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:35:36 Plane crazy world map when
plane-crazy 2022-01-29 23:38:32 ~~amraam when~~
plane-crazy 2022-02-02 20:57:46 Don’t have anymore because they were basically useless
