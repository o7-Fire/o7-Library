general 2020-11-05 18:19:22 Not so, according to attorney Smith. He said anytime you take someone else's photo from a social media page and repost without permission - even if you are in the picture - you are breaking the law. "They are using the image when they do not have the permission to do so," Smith said. "That is copyright infringement. "
