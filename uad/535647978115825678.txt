creations-chat 2020-09-02 23:22:57 rip
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 23:30:53 add more to the map like maybe a city, more waterways, airports, deserts, race tracks, more train tracks and that kind of stuff. as the map is really small and i can barely do a whole lot on that small square :/ and i think it would be a lot more fun with more to do on the map. ðŸ™‚
general 2020-09-07 23:34:11 rick is kinda a dev of plane crazy without him and some others plane crazy wouldnt exist...

general 2020-11-23 04:16:14 oh rip
general 2020-12-16 00:03:28 Destroyer be like

Plane crazy is dying. Nothing new. No new map to explore. Inconsistent developer with trust issues. Very poor optimization. Pvp planes broken. Balance non-existent. For a player who has been playing for 2 years, the game is the same as it was a year ago. If this update doesn't bring anything new and exciting, then the game is gonna be dead. By dead I mean that there will only be a handful of experienced players. Sure, there will be new players, but those will die off quite quickly from the aforementioned reasons. My biggest problem is Rickje himself. For the thousands upon thousands of robux that has been donated to the man, nothing has even been added. I am disappointed that the game has gotten this low with copiers, toxicity, and most importantly, arrogance. I will continue to make content, but with War Thunder quickly overtaking my playing schedule, I will not upload as often. School is also a huge thing that has not allowed me to create content. Back to plane crazy, BUILDING IS REPETITIVE. All it is is to use motor lock techniques to create a very low performing, high quality jet. I am honestly sick of the game I put so much work and time into and it results with no rewarding aspects.
general 2020-12-16 00:03:51 BUILDING IS REPETITIVE.... welcome to building games
the game has gotten this low with copiers, toxicity, again welcome to building games
For the thousands upon thousands of robux that has been donated to the man, nothing has even been added... ok fair 
but with War Thunder quickly overtaking my playing schedule yo wtf does war thunder have to do with ROBLOX of all things
I will not upload as often. School is also a huge thing that has not allowed me to create content. why are you talking about your content? 
All it is is to use motor lock techniques to create a very low performing, high quality jet. I am honestly sick of the game I put so much work and time into and it results with no rewarding aspects. motor lock isn't the entire game sure tons of people use it but that doesn't mean you have to use it.
Balance non-existent: there isn't anything to balance.
And it's not ricks fault that the community is  toxic and terrible.
