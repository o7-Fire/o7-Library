The Tale of Isodium (552252221224648724)
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:18:29 So basically every time I save and it says SAVE SUCCESSFUL, but when I rejoin, it goes back to my old version
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:19:04 Then I have to change it everytime back to the new version
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:19:39 Apparently this was a old glitch a year ago
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:20:03 But it came back for some reason, anyone know how to fix it?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:20:19 Is it just me or is anyone else experiencing this?
bug-reports 2020-05-09 21:22:50 But as long as I stay in the game, it saves
bug-reports 2020-05-10 02:06:05 There was also like this other bug where when I spawn my boat, it just break's apart when everything is perfectly attached. It's not a big bug but it pretty annoying and you have to take a while to fix it
general 2020-05-11 23:54:31 Ouch
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:09 Im not sure if this is me or the game
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:29 There is no blue line on my plane
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:34:52 I added the wings, control panels and everything else
bug-reports 2020-05-12 19:35:01 Can anyone tell me how I can fix this?
bug-reports 2020-05-12 23:31:28 Ok just recently everything stopped
bug-reports 2020-05-13 01:29:29 Apparently one time the game just stopped and this is not only me since it happened to my friend at the same time. Then rejoined and the servers were just frozen
bug-reports 2020-05-13 01:29:44 no one can do anything except walk run and jump
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:24:59 World record speed?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:25:15 I never knew my battleship can go thiss fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:25:23 Oh then who has gotten higher?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:26:46 Infinit?

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:38:28 I've seen this other guy with a giant yamato and I have no idea how he made his turrets so flat
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:39:10 I kinda wanted to make the turret a lil bigger since its a bigger more chonkier battleship, might've made it a tad too big
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:39:43 Batplane?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:40:10 btw how do I get ranked in the discord?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:41:03 My battleship is about 3450 blocks without the ladder and the other blocks so what rank does that give me?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:44:04 I would kindly ask for a shipright rank, btw its about 3400 without the ladder and the fold
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:29:38 Alright this is just a simple question, do you guys like cutter bugs?
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:31:21 Ikr
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:31:35 I don't even know why they exist
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:31:48 Literally I don't even need to ask this question
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:31:56 Almost everyone in the community hates it
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:32:33 Theres these kids in my pvp server that only use cutter bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:32:46 Nice rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:35:40 1K blocks isn't a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:35:48 that doesn't even look like 1k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 19:35:52 Ik

plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:42:51 Aight so I made my jet fly but the only problem is the speed, it only goes at around 200 and I need to know the best way to get more speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:43:36 Do I just add more thrust?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:44:50 2 jet engines and 5 or 4  super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:45:36 Nah only 600 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:46:05 Private server
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:46:16 So do I just add more thrust?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:46:19 And if how?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:46:39 Hover? Rocket? Jet? or Propeller
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:46:41 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:47:06 Mech's are pretty complicated to control
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:47:28 I dunno like my friend tried and completely failed
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:47:38 Im not sure if you need to add reset for the mech
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:47:46 Yeah?

plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:54:00 Im to lazy to learn it
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:55:28 And how do planes do post stall maneuvers so easily?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:55:55 what kind?

plane-crazy 2020-06-10 00:59:24 Its basically weight all in one block
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 01:02:59 Wait nvm I found out how to do a post stall maneuver
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 01:03:21 Just add a lot of propellers and then just post stall
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 01:04:22 Still learning how to actually do a cobra maneuver
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 01:04:33 Like how?
plane-crazy 2020-06-10 01:07:39 Nvm it can just do flips
bug-reports 2020-06-10 01:10:15 Aight so if you look inside the cockpit thats made out of glass from first person view, it will not show water or at least most of it
bug-reports 2020-06-10 01:11:19 And for some reason, the motor's are kinda broken because when I closed my cockpit, it just glitched and went through the  blocks

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 00:48:34 The fact that ballast blocks don't even change the center of mass

creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:14:49 it has low details and looks kinda awkward and low quality, so you're new to plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:22:26 bruh then what does the plane crazy community like? Motor lock? Details? Camera angle? Folding? overly complicated builds?
creations-chat 2021-01-10 20:26:04 yes the funny <a:A_SooFunny_FE:742166719170215967>, anyways yeah pistons for landing gear seems pretty simple and good, if you wanna go to another level you can add motors for no reason. Damnnn post the bee or put the message link

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:44:59 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:45:14 shouldn't this be in general?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:45:35 anyways I heard rick wanted a new map
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:45:46 how big is it gonna be
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:45:50 yeah we really do
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:46:38 I have a lamborghini and I can only race from one end of the black platform to the other end
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:46:53 Im hyped for the new map
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:47:56 hahaha lamborghini on hills go ***flip***
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:48:38 I have a 7000 block build that took me like a month to make but I can't even use it because its so laggy
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:48:44 <a:A_WobblyPensive_FE:742166707438747679>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:49:10 I made it just because I hated cutter bugs
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:49:27 so I wanted a behemoth mech tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:49:29 uh oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:50:11 kinda does but it was so bulky
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:50:20 and it slows it down
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:50:42 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:50:48 I have something similar
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:51:11 its a turret that fires a full salvo
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:51:15 but that was kind of annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:51:48 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:52:23 imagine a cutter bug in real life but then it encounters a CIWS or a PHALANX
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:52:55 <:pogchamp:673633620992196672>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:53:05 <a:PogChomp:602886463469649920><a:PogChomp1:602886556675604492><a:PogChomp2:602886585159254026><a:PogChomp3:602886602905223188>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:53:11 Bruh LMAOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:53:58 Im trying to intercept enemy aircraft but I can't seem to get a hit on it, any tips?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:54:34 I have great maneuverability and yaw,pitch and roll but I can't hit them
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:54:39 yeah ig
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:55:05 but wouldn't aerodynamics have a problem?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:55:07 nah it isn't
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:55:12 its one of those fighters
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:55:38 added 2 fireworks, 2 rockets and a gun
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:55:45 like some F-15 or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:56:38 yeah basically
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:57:45 fireworks on planes are good for close combat
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:57:47 yeah true
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:59:28 cutter is a wedge
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:59:33 its so useless
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:59:35 ikr?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:01:37 I don't think water jets are even good
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:01:54 tnt balls are used for like cannons or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:02:15 fireworks have really short range but if you hit something, it does a lot of damagae
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:02:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:03:37 can we get a guided missile that locks onto targets
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:03:48 we need better pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:04:46 the rockets are good but only problem is they're really slow and they have bad locking abilities
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:05:05 close combat I think
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:05:07 yeeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:05:15 rockets are laggy too
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:05:24 sometimes they just go really really really slow
general 2021-01-10 22:13:09 a bold move
general 2021-01-10 22:13:33 <a:MCCursedGun:796402369818132481>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:14:10 damn that's pretty nice but that's aeronautical

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:19:33 I see you are cultured
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:19:43 star wars epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:19:56 I think it turns like a tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:04 like one tread turns faster than another
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:27 Poggggggggggg
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:20:56 one side of treads turns faster than the other side
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:21:19 so one tread is turning fast while the other side just stops or is slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 22:22:36 I made a really big creation but it was too laggy to even work <a:A_WobblyPensive_FE:742166707438747679>

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:18 yo just me or can people not hear my music?
creations-chat 2021-01-14 23:56:06 yo how tf do people do these intakes
general 2021-01-17 22:02:22 That they banned
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 14:25:22 Yo
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 14:25:30 my friend plays this game called trailmakers
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 14:25:34 and its a lot similar
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 14:25:38 but it costs money (ew)
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 14:26:43 Did plane crazy get the idea from trailmakers?
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 21:47:50 anyone found out how to do thrust vectoring yet?
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 21:47:59 just wondering
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 21:48:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 21:48:21 but like I haven't seen a lot of that
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 21:48:40 plus, wouldn't it be hard to fit in?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:38:49 First of all the blackhawk doors don't open and close like that, second of all the tail is a bit short and awkward, Lastly, the blackhawk has a articulating stabilator I think. Anyways is there anything I can improve on my apache, yes I know the apache has single main rotor and the cockpit isn't well made but il try motor locking it later
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:41:53 bruh okay lol dunno man same thing
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:44:20 Then how do I make it more ***apache***
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:47:24 ah okay is that it?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:51:30 pog
creations-chat 2021-01-18 22:59:28 oh yeahhhh I see the curve, il try using motor lock for that
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:47:11 the front is kinda awkward for the buggati creation
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:49:31 e
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:51:58 but did you base it off the tutorial? Either way looks kind of awkward tutorial or no tutorial
creations-chat 2021-01-19 23:54:27 Same bro FAX
creations-chat 2021-01-20 19:04:58 nice, the 2nd one is better
creations-chat 2021-01-20 19:12:50 Lol
general 2021-01-20 19:20:33 wait there's a war thunder event?
general 2021-01-20 19:20:50 nice

creations-chat 2021-02-02 23:50:26 those intakes and motor lock
creations-chat 2021-02-03 00:03:53 no no im saying the intakes are great
creations-chat 2021-02-23 22:01:27 Motor lock is broken on my tank how to fix
creations-chat 2021-02-23 22:03:27 nvm it was just an awkward part that broke it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:31:17 yo custom mbt, a bit trash but any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:36:42 I tried it but, the rockets end up like popping out after firing. the rockets are already concealed but when fired, it pops up
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:39:48 pretty low effort ngl
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:51:47 does anyone know anything about creations spazzing out for no reason
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:52:44 then getting flung into the naal zone
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:55:28 yeah sure
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 01:55:30 i'll show
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:02:07 don't mind the potato pc recording
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:03:15 bro why does it keep showing my name
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:05:03 wait i'll show
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:05:04 it's easier
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:05:05 to see
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:05:13 https://vimeo.com/801440983
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:07:24 it's really weird because before exploding the motorlock, it's completely fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:07:44 but i removed the motor lock from the build and then my plane just flies off on it's own
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:09:00 i tried finding the problem but once i practically removed the entire airframe, parts were still flying around
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 02:09:59 also the problem only occurs in this build specifically
