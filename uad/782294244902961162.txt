general 2021-10-26 17:01:24 Hey Hey Guys Hello
I want to know what you all Think about Furries
general 2021-10-26 17:03:16 What?
general 2021-10-26 17:04:28 omg Am getting ignored ðŸ˜­
general 2021-10-26 17:05:18 It's a normal question
general 2021-10-26 17:05:20 Im curious
general 2021-10-26 17:05:24 <:happysquidward:884233271750328370>
general 2021-10-26 17:05:47 OK but can you answer tho
general 2021-10-26 17:06:10 What is weird
general 2021-10-26 17:06:31 What makes furries weird
general 2021-10-26 17:07:06 Name a example im still confused ðŸ˜•
general 2021-10-26 17:07:42 Wdym
general 2021-10-26 17:08:25 Im confused
general 2021-10-26 17:11:44 I think that's just a few people, but now my question is does that affect how you see other furries that are different ðŸ¤¨
general 2021-10-26 17:15:23 OK i never heard about that but ok
general 2021-10-26 17:17:17 So what i get from this it's that if someone is dressed up in a furry suit it's walking normally on the streets you would instantly hate whoever it is
general 2021-10-26 17:18:21 And you would also be aware that they could be just a normal person like you but just y'know, using these stuff?
general 2021-10-26 17:19:13 Why wouldn't you be aware of that perhaps may i ask?
general 2021-10-26 17:20:20 That's not exactly like that from i've seen but OK
general 2021-10-26 17:21:59 Thanks for giving me this information
May i use this information in [[NOTHING]]
Goodbye
