The Tale of _plastic_ (497846114314092554)
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 23:38:47 there's a pretty big list of updates we could have
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 23:38:52 so what are the devs working on
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 23:50:35 nice
creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:52:19 also I can definitively say I like most of my builds
creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:55:00 alright cool now explain why three people have decided that a land submarine is directly offending them
creations-chat 2020-11-21 23:57:40 where do you see the problem
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:00:20 1.it's just common sense to not have a bridge if I'm not getting out
2.everyone in the pvp server already says that it's actually a tank, I needed the ballast blocks to spell it out to them
3.perfectly round would need cylinders

it's designed to kill things and be fast, not to look nice
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:03:30 what the hell do you think a good pvp build looks like
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:05:15 my land submarine cleans out pvp servers because it's designed to kill things, not to look really cool
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:08:06 the outstanding mechanism on the land submarine is that it shoots things and goes fast
creations-chat 2020-11-22 00:11:03 I came back to say that your designs are entirely cosmetic
general 2020-11-22 00:15:37 why are all of these designs cosmetic
general 2020-11-22 00:16:24 I posted my land submarine in creations and I've had to try and figure out what the hell they mean by "it looks ugly"
general 2020-11-22 00:17:03 as long as it does it's job well then it should be fine
general 2020-11-22 00:17:31 all of these beautiful designs are cosmetic at best
general 2020-11-22 00:17:42 I have a land submarine for a reason, it kills things good and it goes fast
general 2020-11-22 00:18:28 if you want faster than sanic then we should bring back conveyor engines
general 2020-11-22 00:19:03 I forgot which update it was but my conveyor engine bomber stopped working
general 2020-11-22 00:19:32 because fast
general 2020-11-22 00:20:11 I've found that most things posted in creations are the easiest targets for me
general 2020-11-22 00:20:37 because they're cosmetic
general 2020-11-22 00:20:45 they aren't designed to fight, they're designed to look cool
the-dump 2020-11-22 00:21:42 
the-dump 2020-11-22 00:21:51 beautiful art that I made
general 2020-11-22 00:39:32 what is the definition of function to most people here
general 2020-11-22 00:39:41 to me it's just the ability to kill everything and move
general 2020-11-22 00:40:49 that's not function, that's looking cool
general 2020-11-22 00:41:41 <@!715019067773157406> then tell me what a good pvp build is
general 2020-11-22 00:41:52 I want to know what is wrong with a land submarine designed to kill
general 2020-11-22 00:42:08 yeah ftd does everything better than plane crazy
general 2020-11-22 00:43:28 <@456226577798135808> I joined this server because I wanted to see what people consider a good build to be.
general 2020-11-22 00:44:02 also I would use the main channel instead of dm's but this isn't <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-11-22 00:45:01 then tell me
general 2020-11-22 00:45:03 what is a fucking
general 2020-11-22 00:45:04 good
general 2020-11-22 00:45:05 build
general 2020-11-22 00:47:57 alright, back
general 2020-11-22 00:48:47 cool, it has a gun
general 2020-11-22 00:49:18 so you're saying that a good build is designed by function and looks
general 2020-11-22 00:49:27 it has looks
general 2020-11-22 00:49:31 the function is moving
general 2020-11-22 00:50:29 the point is to design things
general 2020-11-22 00:50:37 it's an engineering game
general 2020-11-22 00:50:51 if you want looks, you could play on paint online
general 2020-11-22 00:52:05 a good build should work in pvp
general 2020-11-22 00:52:08 without dying instantly
general 2020-11-22 00:52:10 several times
general 2020-11-22 00:53:00 explain how a good build is a fucking piece of art
general 2020-11-22 00:53:19 draw something nice and it's a good build
general 2020-11-22 00:53:41 you said it looks nice so it's a good build
general 2020-11-22 00:54:21 my designs clear out pvp servers because that's the fucking point of pvp servers
general 2020-11-22 00:54:38 sure but if another design can kill it then that one is better
general 2020-11-22 00:55:19 sure, but my land submarine is fast as fuck
general 2020-11-22 00:55:26 it's a good design
general 2020-11-22 00:55:34 that tank is a good design
general 2020-11-22 00:55:59 I was talking about the tank dipshit
general 2020-11-22 00:57:11 I made a land submarine and it's designed to kill things
general 2020-11-22 00:57:22 IS IT FUCKING DESIGNED TO LOOK NICE?
general 2020-11-22 00:57:28 oh hey
general 2020-11-22 00:57:47 pretty sure we were all trying to kill eachother like 5 seconds ago
