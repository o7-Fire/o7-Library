bug-reports 2022-04-20 19:22:55 I'm not sure if this has been reported yet but there's a glitch in Plane Crazy I first experienced a few months ago, where your vehicle disappears for 1-2 seconds then reappears, but you can't control it, and it's like there's no wings, or propulsion. It's not extremely common and can be fixed by respawning your build but its annoying
help 2022-04-20 19:26:29 but you dont want to spend the time to download it just to record a few seconds of video
bug-reports 2022-04-20 19:26:50 I don't know which category it would go in though

creations-chat 2022-06-25 02:13:54 yes
also why tf is cooldown so long
creations-chat 2022-06-25 02:18:08 the reason we have 2000 of almost anything is because the higher forces are trying to test how good we can build
and that explains the small plots
motor locking was intentional
they just wanted us to find it

creations-chat 2022-10-15 19:37:35 Low effort probably
I've never done buildings before

But I didn't make it just for people to crash into it...

Neither did I intend it to be a memorial
Just a fun little project to see how the Twin Towers would look along with the Freedom Tower

I never got to see them personally and I promise you that if I did it would have been a lot better

plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:59:21 MBFC doesn't even stay true to their name so I made this
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:59:40 I would go for whichever one works better
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:00:49 Ever heard of a rotating joint
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:01:13 Tbh it's just a motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:01:18 3 actually
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:01:55 But as far as I know it's either a rotating joint or it tilts
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 04:04:06 I think I would go for the tilting joint option
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:37:37 I can't get on rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:37:50 It's 1:37
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 05:37:53 Am
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:53:05 Or instead of an import code you can send a build to someone
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:53:24 So not everyone in the server can get the plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:53:46 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:54:37 But import codes would be like
"Bro you want my F-18? Here's the import code: SP4xKLzn"

Then suddenly everyone in the server has it
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:55:01 Using image IDs right
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 11:55:18 I think 4 would be a bit small...

plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:17:19 I know thankyouverymuch
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:18:46 I did say "old af"
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:19:08 So it's expected
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:19:15 2, maybe 3 years
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:19:56 The Amtrak one is also valid to be called trash

plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:20:08 And probably the rest of my builds in here

plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:41:49 I don't understand the concept of simplicity and need to motorlock everything ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:41:54 Pls send help
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:42:12 I know
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:42:15 Pls send help
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:42:23 Instead of just saying "your builds suck"
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:45:18 Are you using engines inside the heli or just the rotor
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:45:54 Are you using motors to power the rotors or engines on the blades
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:46:10 ?
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:50:36 I don't know then
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 15:50:52 My best guess is add another motor
