creations-chat 2020-04-13 00:57:02 i cant see how people would downvote this masterpiece
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:03:28 thx
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:03:46 it was difficult making the head, but the rest was easy
bug-reports 2020-04-13 01:08:03 Motor 2 glitch
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:27:55 my builds get downvoted too
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:28:50 i like how every build that is star wars only gets upvotes, but all the downvotes went to my lightsaber
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:29:24 might not be balanced
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:30:20 pistons are pretty bouncy in this game
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:31:02 that kinda doesnt make sence
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:31:22 logically, it should reduce bounciness since its putting more downforce on the pistons
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:32:19 nice
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:32:46 have you seen my recent bug report?

creations-chat 2020-05-24 06:23:04 I had to search up an ornithopter design from online, and try to make an adaptable version for this game, because the one online won't work the same for this game
creations-chat 2020-05-24 06:23:16 It's the lor starcutter

creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:40:07 because i would go for humber for the big gun
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:40:59 they do look similar
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:41:21 so maybe build the car, but add features to each to see which you like
creations-chat 2020-07-13 15:41:38 they both look good either way

creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:11:44 with new ones?
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:15:47 try shifting the entire build by one block. it might where the surface is place in that build
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:16:06 also, save and load up the build again and see if that works too
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 15:24:28 
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:46:34 put the blocks in a 6x6 frame
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:46:39 just regular blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:47:10 and put wedges to make the circle  where it can closely resemble a wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-18 15:59:30 no you dont need lock motors
creations-chat 2020-08-18 16:00:18 actually it might not be possible
creations-chat 2020-08-18 16:00:22 unless...
creations-chat 2020-08-18 16:01:02 if you make it 5x5 and add half blocks instead, you can theoretically make a 6x6 wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-18 16:01:37 yeah it can be possible if you use half blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-18 16:02:19 yes

plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:07:49 I have a question. After i was shot down in pvp in my warship, it started to sink in the water. i have absolutly no ballast tanks or ballast blocks. Is it a new feature in plane crazy, or is it just a common bug? EDIT: none of the rocket engines were pushing it down either
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:10:37 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:12:01 I've had someone come up to my shockwave build, and asked if it was a tutorial build, and if it is, then can he or she have it
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:12:20 Of course it wasn't lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:13:06 They didn't even know who shockwave was lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:13:39 Yes the transformer
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:14:05 I built the prime version
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:14:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:14:24 Honestly the best series for shockwave too
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:15:57 Interesting
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:16:31 Well can't really sink something with gravity.
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:16:57 Cause then the water will get more dense preventing it to sink
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:18:01 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:18:09 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:18:32 I smeel a h y p o c r I t

plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:31:35 believe it or not, i had to look at the shockwave toy to see how i can transform it
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:33:32 I had to look at these two images to figure out how to transform him
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:33:36 
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:34:52 you can just add a magnet to the turret under the motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:35:03 no it actually transforms
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:35:20 lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:35:27 its more simple than i thought
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:35:45 if you look up shockwave toy reviews, its more simple than it looks
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 23:36:15 but yes i did have to put each motor and block precisly
