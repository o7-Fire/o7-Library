plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:31:46 i actually think i know how that works and i know a bypass
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:32:07 Rickje: "The saw block will not replace the cutter block, its a brand new block with a new function."
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:32:33 Correct and i think i know how that works
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:32:39 and i know a glitch
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:32:44 data save glitch is funny
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:32:59 so even if they blacklisted you
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:33:06 your bug wont be affected because the data got save glitched
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:33:24 the data save glitch is also how the Infinite stability glitch works
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 00:33:41 yep and i dont care

help 2022-07-27 22:24:38 you can use builds for stuff other than their intended purpose yknow
help 2022-07-27 22:25:25 lmao i like how the view of shredders changed though ngl
help 2022-07-27 22:25:32 before the shredder era they where a respected build
help 2022-07-27 22:25:42 until a surge of newer more toxic players joined and started using them
help 2022-07-27 22:25:47 Yes.
help 2022-07-27 22:26:14 i was around when shredders became a thing and they where respected until toxic new ppl started making armies of the bugs
help 2022-07-27 22:26:24 yes
help 2022-07-27 22:26:25 true
help 2022-07-27 22:26:58 i honestly dont care for shredders
help 2022-07-27 22:27:04 i just see them as another viable build
help 2022-07-27 22:27:07 if i ever need stuff
help 2022-07-27 22:27:16 like the mouse pointed shredder tech is nice for ships
help 2022-07-27 22:27:57 wasd for cinematics also it dosnt have cutters so its actually classified as just a wasd bug
