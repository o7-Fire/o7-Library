<@!644377285746622494>  make it wider, give it a rounder turret, smaller gun, and all the stuff the other guy said
creations-chat 2020-11-26 03:29:58 you should probs expect criticism, dont cry if people dont like your build
creations-chat 2020-12-15 16:59:36 <@!726796101822316606> is that a reference to the the top gear reliant space shuttle thing
