plane-crazy 2020-01-14 03:44:08 Yikes
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 03:45:15 Maybe it's because you didn't use cylinders to make it look like tracks or something

plane-crazy 2020-04-07 22:41:04 what
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 21:07:08 i made a tropical island with a bar on it cus i was board
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 21:07:13 
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 21:07:22 it even has a coconut
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 21:07:30 oh yeah and this
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 21:07:34 but we dont talk about that
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 15:57:25 I made the HMS Havoc which was made in 1893

general 2021-08-28 02:16:21 <@!368581738496131072> there were 2,710 liberty ships made
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:18:59 2,710 liberty cargo ships were made, in fact i got to be on one a few years ago its called the USS Victory
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:21:44 somehow it can still run and every few years they give rides but its not allowed to leave Tampa bays gulf. although it does have the slight issue of taking like 3 days for the engine to be fully running but hey it was made in 1945 so i wont be too hard on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:23:01 not all jets
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:23:48 the russian su-57 felon only has a few built
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:24:20 i think we have like 100 f22s in service currently which is the counter to the felon
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:26:44 the czech republic has that new spg they are gonna use for artillery now that thing looks crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:27:05 the turret has no crew it only has 2 people operating it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:27:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:27:57 not like its gonna make much of a diffrence now have you seen the new ammo the US is gonna use for its artillery guns?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:29:00 its gps guided munitions that when fired will track the target even on the move
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:29:34 so a moving covoy is still under threat of getting a 150mm to the face
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:29:56 i think they said somthing about having it in service around 2022 or 2023
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:30:07 definitely
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:31:04 also smart cluster munitions i just found out those were a thing and watching how they work and fascinating
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:31:32 i made a catapult that can hit a target anywhere on the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:31:43 i love using it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:32:09 hold on ima get a pic of mine
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:06 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:33 they are probably gonna replace the cwis with laser pods
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:35:29 also i did this so i know where i want to hit on the map
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:10 i dont know much about rail guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:16 as much as i do with other guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:55 they are probably gonna be put onto ships first before anything else
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:37:00 now that i think about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:37:33 you know how the B-52 is really old and is gonna be retired in like 2050 or somthing
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:37:39 well if you think about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:37:53 if we get to the point to where we can make laser pods smaller
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:38:02 they can put these on b-52s
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:38:11 thus extending service of the planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:38:49 because anti air missiles will have a harder time to reach them
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:39:22 thats my theory on what is probably gonna happen to the b-52
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:39:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:40:06 it is gonna struggle to get to that speed to begin with
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:40:41 plus sound isnt really that much of in issue sense b2s are made to stay at a higher alt
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:40:45 gm
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:40:51 well good night to me
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:41:06 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:42:17 im pretty sure the night hawk was made to be both stealth in sound and radar since it flew very low
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:42:36 ahhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:44:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:45:05 ik exactly what your talking about there
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:45:16 there was a gun that was made to do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:45:52 it squished the ammo as it traveled trough barrel making it more dense
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:46:08 i think its called a squeeze bore gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:52:12 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:52:50 yeah i can see why that would cost alot of power
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:55:13 true
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:56:52 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:57:35 and nuclear power plants
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:58:21 what do they do
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:59:42 man i dont know any of these guns i have more knowledge on traditional weapons lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:59:58 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:04:17 if it was 1830 this would actually be pretty useful for a weapon on a larger scale lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:06:24 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:12:13 yeah people are just rude for no reason sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:16:49 i feel your pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:17:02 the angles in the game are kinda limiting somtimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:19:08 you want names?
