plane-crazy 2023-05-04 00:59:24 kinda tricky to get that one right
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 00:59:40 I'm attempting to make a B-25
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:06:41 having some serious issues with my B-25, any recommendations?
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:07:40 ok uh I don't have image perms
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:08:22 ok so right now it is looking a lot taller than it really should
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:08:41 but my issue is the landing gear can't fold in
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:08:46 if I make it shorter
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:09:04 and trying to round off the cockpit and the frontal gunners seat is tricky
