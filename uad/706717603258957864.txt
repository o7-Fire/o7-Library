general 2022-06-04 16:55:34 If only good builds were compatible for pvp
general 2022-06-04 16:56:53 Yeah cuz ppl are motorlocking like 500bombs together lmao
general 2022-06-04 16:59:09 Nice tomcat damn
general 2022-06-04 17:01:05 Not possible in public servers 💀
general 2022-06-04 17:04:05 the problem is durability, planes have way better maneuverability and ships are just sitting ducks
general 2022-06-04 17:04:14 Basically target practice
general 2022-06-04 17:06:49 go under the ship and disconnect bombs lol
general 2022-06-04 17:08:42 I advise y'all to not get ur hopes up so you don't get disappointed
general 2022-06-04 17:09:01 Target practice irl too lmao
general 2022-06-04 17:10:06 not really possible
general 2022-06-04 17:10:22 Bro that's just flying motorlock
general 2022-06-04 17:10:28 Motorlock on wings
general 2022-06-04 17:11:05 That means everything else would only get 5 guns including destroyers
general 2022-06-04 17:11:49 Limiting it to only jets isn't possible, the game doesn't know what you're building
general 2022-06-04 17:12:37 yeah when mainland is like 40meters from the sea 💀
general 2022-06-04 17:13:35 Idk that's a bit complicated
general 2022-06-04 17:14:37 His car is indeed better
general 2022-06-04 17:15:23 Also can we finally get helis that don't fly like jets?
general 2022-06-04 17:16:36 Instead of what's biologically accurate

general 2022-06-04 17:18:59 Money
general 2022-06-04 17:19:34 Also everyones getting F-35s lol
general 2022-06-04 17:20:34 There's like 4 operational SU-57s
general 2022-06-04 17:21:25 Isnt that thing old?
general 2022-06-04 17:21:30 no
general 2022-06-04 17:21:53 They can hardly even afford to make them
general 2022-06-04 17:22:22 Also SU-57s don't at all look stealthy
general 2022-06-04 17:22:32 that sht looks bolted together
general 2022-06-04 17:22:58 the amount of rivets on the outside of that thing lmao
general 2022-06-04 17:23:12 They're an absolute fail
general 2022-06-04 17:23:48 F-35s are really good in BVR combat
general 2022-06-04 17:24:22 The entire thing looks like scrap metal lol
general 2022-06-04 17:24:48 No
general 2022-06-04 17:25:08 Bro Russia has like 4 operational SU-57s 💀
general 2022-06-04 17:25:46 F-35 is a multi role fighter
general 2022-06-04 17:26:02 It can also go on aircraft carriers which F-22s cant
general 2022-06-04 17:26:42 No
general 2022-06-04 17:27:26 F-35s are also used by the US Navy and the F-22 is only used by the air force
general 2022-06-04 17:27:59 bro they suck lol
general 2022-06-04 17:28:27 no
general 2022-06-04 17:29:43 The F-35 is used by multiple different countries for bombing, air force and carrier based operations, the F-22s are basically the last resort which is mainly for defending an airspace
general 2022-06-04 17:30:35 I don't think it should lose to an F-14
general 2022-06-04 17:32:36 Yeah it can technically do other things but that's not what it's mainly designed for, the F-35 is much more capable for those other stuff
general 2022-06-04 17:33:40 The SU-57 is only maneuverability, literally all it has
general 2022-06-04 17:34:09 It doesn't even have rear end visibility
general 2022-06-04 17:35:14 SU-57s aren't an actual threat, they're also a disaster to maintain
general 2022-06-04 17:35:36 they certainly look cool tho
general 2022-06-04 17:37:33 I personally think the SU-57 looks better, especially with the paint designs
general 2022-06-04 17:38:00 I know
general 2022-06-04 17:38:36 They look generic
general 2022-06-04 17:39:06 I think it looks cool lol
general 2022-06-04 17:39:58 It's different
general 2022-06-04 17:40:16 It looks like a cross between the F-22 and the SU-57
general 2022-06-04 17:40:49 That nose design is to disperse lightning bolts
general 2022-06-04 17:41:22 The F-35has it but it looks better
general 2022-06-04 17:42:33 It's Russia's counter to the F-22 but it sucks
general 2022-06-04 17:44:08 Mf belongs in an aquarium
general 2022-06-04 17:45:12 Bro the stealth ones looks the best lmao wdym
general 2022-06-04 17:48:35 Nah we should fly over china without stealth
general 2022-06-04 17:49:52 Those radars would be able to detect grains of sand 💀
general 2022-06-04 17:50:50 Does an F-35 even need guns?
general 2022-06-04 17:51:21 dude
general 2022-06-04 17:51:51 Guns are for dogfights, F-35s are for BVR combat
general 2022-06-04 17:52:49 they point their nose at the ground?💀
general 2022-06-04 17:53:07 Missiles and bombs
general 2022-06-04 17:53:20 I mean, the A-10 sucks
general 2022-06-04 17:54:09 Dude ofc it's useful against people who can't shoot it down
general 2022-06-04 17:54:35 Put it in the range of any modern air defense system
general 2022-06-04 17:55:26 dude the A-10 can only operate in already dominated air spaces .-
general 2022-06-04 17:56:20 I was doing a different comparison
general 2022-06-04 17:57:19 That thing has a huge amount of friendly fires because of how outdated it is
general 2022-06-04 17:58:07 I'd send proof if I had image perms lol
general 2022-06-04 17:58:42 There has been multiple different cases in the 2000's alone

Also how do you compare a phantom to a 747💀

creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:07:11 The F-14 is indeed overrated
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:10:36 I still don't get how they managed to fit those on aircraft carriers


Also the F-35 needs more love
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:15:51 I never really got that argument, F-22s are more expensive to maintain and it's main role is air dominance, they aren't used very often cuz there's no need

the F-35 excells at BVR combat and is a multi role fighter which can go on aircraft carriers
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:18:36 Idk of any enemy fighter that could beat the F-35 in BVR combat lol

We're also mass producing them
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:22:08 I personally think it looks better than the f 22, it looks more compact
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:36:19 Dude the SU-57 looks like it's made of scrap metal, there's also rivets all around it
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:39:27 Yeah it could def beat it in a dogfight which basically never happens but it definitely can't beat an F-35 or an F-22 in BVR fights
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:42:00 Exactly, which gives the F-22 or the F-35 a huge advantage
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:44:32 They'd see the SU-57 long before visual range much less a dogfight lol
creations-chat 2022-06-16 04:47:50 The a-10 is basically for clean up after they already won


If it tries to enter enemy airspaces it's a sitting duck

creations-chat 2022-06-17 02:47:40 The SU-57 is pretty much a failed project lol


Indeed

And the color schemes 👌
creations-chat 2022-06-17 02:50:43 and it's supposed to be a stealth fighter yet it's not very stealthy, idk what they were thinking
creations-chat 2022-06-17 02:53:35 https://youtu.be/Zid1Nv-FfyQ along with the design the sound it makes is just 👌
creations-chat 2022-06-17 02:55:55 Fighter jets are seen as offensive instead of defense weapons so the US won't be sending any to Ukraine

Unless they wanna risk nuclear war ofc

Oh rip politics is banned
creations-chat 2022-06-17 02:58:51 I mean, fighter jets are the kind of equipment that can make advances on dominated airspaces
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:05:52 Stfu and listen to this su 57

creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:49:20 It's literally the most technology advanced jet ever made
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:52:58 People always bring up the fact that it's expensive but it was literally built to be exported, idk why no none talks about how profitable they are
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:56:24 speed really doesn't matter nowadays, fighters are getting even slower and slower by the generation if you haven't noticed, higher speed only shortens the combat range
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:59:00 They can also go on aircraft carriers

The F-22 has to travel from mainland USA
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:01:32 The base of operations can be anywhere which extends the combat range unlike the F-22 that's only designed for the air force and only operates from mainland USA


The F-35 is as maneuverable as an F-16 which is more than enough

There's also the F-35C that also does carrier based operations
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:05:53 have you not seen the maneuverability comparison
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:12:49 an F-35 pilot could be at a local McDonald's and order a ground to air strike <a:PepeLaughA:702582895499542579>
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:14:51 I doubt it could beat an F-22 in a dogfight
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:17:12 But, the new gen will always be better than the old and it'll continue getting upgrades for the next few decades

creations-chat 2022-06-25 04:28:24 Use hover thrusters for the rotors

Make the rotors out of hover thrusters to make it spin and helium blocks, it allows it to float in place

Then u can use small propellers to control it

creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:03:25 Make the rotors out of signs and make them spin slower at around 20-30 speed
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:05:54 Like helicopters in plane crazy operates any way similarly to as they do irl
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:09:29 that still isn't close to how they actually work, I don't think cheating really matters, people are strapping rocket engines to their rotors
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:14:40 if you mean stopping the rest of the heli from spinning then you need 2 motors, 1 half the speed and spinning in the opposite direction of the one above it to counteract some gravity stuff

<:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:20:51 I mean, that's what the tail rotor is used for, it's just apart of the main in this case


Tail rotors are kinda useless though, unless idk how to use it
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:23:58 I tried making a carrier once, it kept sinking to the side 🗿

creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:36:31 wait it actually works like that in game?


I usually just see people use it for controls


Is it effective though
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:38:35 Damn I gotta try that out lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:40:37 Didn't know it works in game too 🗿

creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:46:46 <@531650600295727115> can you show any examples?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:50:21 I just make the rotors completely useless and make the controls with helium and propellers
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:52:41 This could possibly be a game changer if someone gets the tail rotor to counteract perfectly 🗿
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:55:29 Maybe if the speed is adjusted
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:57:46 Tilted wing panels or control surfaces?

Man

One thing I've noticed, when you balance one thing something else is imbalanced

Like counteracting the torque buy creates a bigger problem which is the roll
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:01:11 Aight now I got something to think about
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:03:18 I gotta experiment with this
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:30:04 Damn it's good until it starts moving, is the roll a bug or what
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:59:07 <@504577008383033344> what kind of rotors are you using
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:50:25 The counter torque doesn't seem to be effective
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:55:07 🤔

creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:44:37 Does this look 1 wide 🗿
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:46:49 Well of course the smallest point of the nose is 1 wide, it has to start somewhere
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:49:03 "boxness" how dare I have an opposing opinion, I must be repeating something a YouTuber said because I'm not apart of the majority that think it looks good
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:53:18 on 1 wide builds the nose directly aligns with the cockpit, that clearly isn't the case as it goes around it
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:55:23 
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:58:18 I mean, I could always show you a better one, just gimme a good 1 wide

Is it a mig 29?
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:10:46 I don't see anyone making non 1 wide F-2 s so I can't find an example
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:24:58 Aight my phone died and I'll just say the previous F-16 is better and themadvulpen has a better tomcat and MiG-29 cuz I'm currently too lazy to find other examples
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:27:01 
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:29:05 The details on a 1 wide builds are literally 1/10th the size of the entire dimensions


9 more signs and you could make an entire nose
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:34:56 And this is better?💀
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:36:58 Is the real a-10 also 1 wide?<@401530469952389130>

creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:48:30 Yours is made of 4 90 degree angles
creations-chat 2022-07-11 00:54:52 Definitely more accurate than an a-10 with squared 90 degree edges and a blacked out  cockpit

With decals that's 1/10th of the size of the total nose

and landing gears that belongs on a cessna

creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:06:11 The F-35 is already there which is one of the best fighters currently

<@683015364975657024> ?
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:10:06 You'll be surprised to know that the F-15 and 16 are more expensive than an F-35 C


Maneuverability plays an even lesser role as dogfighting is irrelevant


The F-35 can shoot off boresight which doesn't even require it to point it's nose 
<@683015364975657024>


So I think you're the dumb one
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:13:06 In what universe are you living in, when has the last recorded dogfight happened



<@723940197456281640>  the helmet mounted view allows it to even lock enemies by looking through the jet itself lol
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:15:41 Can they lock enemies by seeing through the jet?


<@683015364975657024> do you think flares are guaranteed to succeed
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:20:25 Also on what you said earlier, the F-35 may be expensive but it's build to be exported which makes it extremely profitable with so many nations having interest in it<@683015364975657024> 


We've also lost more F-15s and F-16s than F-35s in the entire time the F-35 has existed


Just crashes<@723940197456281640>
creations-chat 2022-07-15 05:23:07 We've lost alot of A-10s in those same missions just to show you how it sucks lol

I mean I can understand if it's an F-18 or sum
creations-chat 2022-07-17 03:34:19 I never said only F-18, the nose of an F-35's width is blatantly wider than the cockpit, the line that spans from to the tip of the nose to the start of the intakes for volt distribution spans AROUND the cockpit 


An F-18 however, the width of the cockpit is much closer to width of the nose
creations-chat 2022-07-17 03:36:49

creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:50:59 Bro the f 35 is the Tesla of fighter jets


Pretty much only the f 22 could consistently beat it
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:54:28 Yeah, we're starting to drop maneuverability as it's far less important than how it used to be


Not the Russians though, as long as it can do a cobra maneuver they're fine with it
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:56:40 Pretty much


Not even made primarily for that stuff yet excels at it
creations-chat 2022-08-18 04:59:11 I mean it depends on the jet, some can recover much easier than others
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:01:37 I'm just waiting for them to finally retire the a-10
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:03:56 Man, it just ain't good anymore, they keep upgrading it but that's not gonna overall make a difference
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:07:48 It was never good

It was already underpowered the day it entered service in 1972. It was designed for Vietnam era close air support, and specifically to attack Warsaw Pact tank forces in central Europe
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:13:34 it really can't perform operations without any other intelligence guiding it, even CAS is difficult for it because a cannon as powerful as the GAU-8 is extremely inaccurate


It was survivable sure but lots of them were still shot down by very dated anti aircraft artillery in dominated airspaces or they returned unoperational 


It's also extremely vulnerable, having to fly low and slow in loops for a long period of time while the pilot has to use binoculars


a very survivable, powerful ground attacker needs stealth. Speed. Range. Datalinking and state of the art sensor fusion to ensure high levels of fire control efficiency. A modern ground attack jet looks nothing like the 70s relic that characteristics the A-10s design criteria.
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:19:19 Bro is really typing huh

creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:50:35 Also sorry for bringing this up again but the f-35 isn't expensive, it's cheaper than modern variants of the eurofighter, f-16, f-15 and it's built to be sold at a profit <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:52:39 oh woops nvm <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:54:40 🤣
creations-chat 2022-08-18 05:57:58 I find it weird how that one time some dude failed the carrier landing with the f 35 and they blamed the jet

I mean sure it doesn't even have automated parking but it's the pilot's fault
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:06:47 Just 5
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:10:40 google isn't always accurate my guy, the f 18 carries the Aim-120 AMRAAM, not the aim-120D


The F-18 is incapable of shooting off boresight, therefore it doesn't carry the AIM-9X sidewinder

creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:28:00 Dawg the f 35 is the most profitable aircraft ever made, the exports negates the cost per operation and the product price is much cheaper than the best 4th gens, the 5th gens also do a much better job and less prone to degradation
creations-chat 2022-08-18 06:30:06 I'ma need some context, also how much has the US made and will continually make from exporting F-35s?

creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:31:21 How does it even move with the amount of drag that hole in the front creates collecting water

Have u ever pulled a cup or sum through water? It creates alot if resistance 🗿
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:36:54 do you know what water pressure and drag is, there's a reason the bow of a ship is shaped like a wedge and not a cone 🗿
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:40:14 how'd anyone else react when someone makes a plane without wings
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:42:46 The front not collecting water is important about a sub, bro that's like dragging a parachute under water🗿
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:44:51 what you just said directly goes against the important factor played by aerodynamics,

 "why not just put a more powerful engine instead of making it aerodynamic"
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:47:33 "still viable with the correct tuning" Imagine a jet with a giant cone Infront of it to catch all the air 🗿
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:51:23 you're arguing against something that's already scientifically proven about physics, yeah bees can fly with tiny wings, that has nothing to do with a sub being unable to move under water because of a giant cone


A jet with a cone catching the air is already a bad idea, hence why aerodynamics is one of the most important factors to consider


Now water is much more dense than air and subs are much more heavier than a fighter jet, I think you can put 2 and 2 together from here
creations-chat 2022-08-23 01:54:08 Bro u can't be all "according to all known laws of aviation" then cop out as soon as you're disproven💀

creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:21:14 Is it futuristic?
creations-chat 2022-08-23 02:25:42 His sub doesn't have a place where it expels water at a higher pressure, it has a propeller trying to push against it's water cone

Better to just refrain from edits all together
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:30:56 You missed the point <:BIG1:588443768806703124>

If you can edit in an afterburner instead of just making one, wouldn't see the problem with editing out exposed motorlocks
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:34:17 Just don't edit your imagines all together since it's hard drawing a line on how much you can edit


"Why do you care" is a dumb question, could be applied to literally everything
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:36:52 just don't edit your imagines if you're gonna post them lol

<@567763933952475157> dawg I don't even know the guy
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:40:11 there's just not a line drawn with how much edits you can do, it's better to refrain before people start editing out their motorlock
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:42:13 🗿

ok so since there's no rule that says how much you can edit, people could start doing more drastic edits

better to just not edit
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:45:33 Everything's better with shaders B)
creations-chat 2022-09-12 18:48:10 I mean shaders carry hard but yeah they should be allowed

creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:38:14 I downvoted a build
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:40:21 That's a funny way to twist it, I said "I don't like the build", I never said it was "shit" because I know people are allowed to have opinions


<@682147422218223616> bro that's literally all I did, I downvoted a build then they started all of this
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:42:28 Again, when did I say it was dogshit?

I legit just said I don't like it, you're making up your own perception
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:44:35 I mean it's safer to not specify, they're gonna immediately hyper analyzing what I said to pick apart everything they don't agree with and try to use it against me


I'm just gonna leave it at "I don't like it" never said it was dogshit
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:46:47 The donkey copter is actually sick though
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:48:53 me when no grass
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:51:19 dude I wasn't calling the build dogshit lmao

I said "are you really pinging me for this dogshit?" The reasoning for pinging me, the reason for pinging me was dogshit, not the build
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:54:43 My sentence was alright, different people take different things different ways, blame your own perception
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:56:46 You taking something the wrong way really isn't my fault, sentences are interpreted in different ways 😗
creations-chat 2022-09-29 02:02:47 Misinterpretation isn't my fault, it can be taken in different ways by different people



If me saying dogshit in a completely different sentence somehow shapes your perception then that's on you and your reading skills bud
creations-chat 2022-09-29 02:05:14 or "why did u ping me for this dogshit reason", doesn't that sentence make more sense?


Why did you ping me for this dogshit build just sounds off

creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:21:03 Is the harrier also a ground attacker and bomber? Does it excells at BVR?
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:23:09 the F-16 wouldn't even have gotten there in the first place, you're using no stealth when the bomb bays are open as an argument when the F-16 never had it to begin with
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:25:25 The F-35 doesn't mount bombs externally

Only missiles in some cases
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:27:47 it notably carries less than the F-16..
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:31:37 The F-16 wasn't built as a multi role fighter, it just happens to be able to somewhat do it

A non stealth aircraft would've been long tracked or intercepted without reaching it's desired targets

The F-35 however delays tracking long enough to take out the targets then possibly evade radar detection after


The F-35 also has exceptionally more spacial awareness, hence more bombing accuracy
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:34:16 ah yes, let's use a plane that doesn't fucking work in the 21st century because it's less expensive
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:37:14 putting new tires on an old ass car that wasn't even built for upgrades in the first place, you clearly have a 1970's perception of what air to air or air to ground combat is
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:39:37 yeah, the last time I checked the US wasn't putting B2 or B-52's on aircraft carriers, they had to be escorted from dry land by something that could've done it in the first place like... The F-35??
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:42:45 me when my F-14's are getting spawnkilled on our aircraft carrier at the south china sea by J-20's we can't even see
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:46:00 Mf had a birthday and turned F-15
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:48:46 dawg can you repeat that?💀
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:51:01 that's so dumb I don't even know where to start
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:54:02 Aight so
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:57:57 Swing wings have caveats, such as penalties of the aircraft's RCS, especially at the joints of the swing, they're tools to better aerodynamics instead of stealth, sweep wing interfaces just cannot be stealthy, that should say enough as to why it couldn't keep up with 5th gens, it gets blown before it knew it was in a fight
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:00:46 You could upgrade it all you want, you're still ripping a fossil out of a museum and putting it back on the battlefield
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:04:04 We should've also kept upgrading the P-51 mustang and it would've kept up with modern fighters right?
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:06:31 Your argument didn't even have grounds in the first place, the F-14 wasn't designed with upgrades in mind
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:09:01 oh my fucking god 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:11:03 these mfs want a topgun season 3 so bad
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:13:55 well yeah when there's modern jets 1 tapping it before it even knew they were there
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:16:18 how fucked in the head are you
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:19:12 It wasn't designed for upgrades in the first place, even if they magically upgraded it it's still an old ass jet that underperforms yet expensive as shit to maintain, why tf would they be keeping around this old ass dog when an F-18 could easily replace it? The good ol'days? Nostalgia?
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:22:32 man just stfu and look at this goofy ahh pilot
creations-chat 2022-10-03 05:25:56 Theoretically it couldn't also have giant ass magnets to suck other planes out of the sky

It's quite easy to make a comparison like that if you're making unrealistic hypothetical scenerios

creations-chat 2022-10-05 04:53:29 What I think about the statement "violence in television is one of the major reasons for the escalating crime rate in society"
creations-chat 2022-10-05 04:55:35 I wonder what tv shows those Gotham mfs have been watching
creations-chat 2022-10-05 04:57:56 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-10-05 05:02:46 I'm almost done but I actually don't agree with it, it's never been statistically proven that it contributes to crime, these violent shows are also watched in countries with the lowest crime rates yet there's been no change
creations-chat 2022-10-05 05:06:17 Yeah I included that, most of the most of the countries with the highest crime rates have limited to no access to television in the first place

creations-chat 2022-10-07 05:28:33 a hornet with its expected loadout would be around 10 M^2 RCS or more, a su 57 would be about 1 m^2, it is stealthy but not comparable to the j-20, F-22 or the F-35

creations-chat 2022-10-11 23:33:10 you learn from tutorials without even realizing it at first, you've gotta be the most oblivious mf to just disregard everything done in this specific way to achieve "this"

I used to copy sht from tutorial builds to put it on my own builds, I think everyone who used tutorials did that
creations-chat 2022-10-11 23:36:42 i mean yeah, I copied parts like how to make a specific angle

creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:55:56 Mf if you can't take constructive criticism don't ask for it, asking me to send my own builds and shit lmfao

creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:00:29 what am I supposed to do with that information
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:05:34 I deleted it to avoid unnecessary shit for it, the entire point was for him to fix his spine then he got mad
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:07:54 Yeah, after he got mad and called me a whitename when I told him to fix his spine 🗿
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:12:09 dawg the entire thing is disproportionate, look how low and off the intakes are
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:14:11 How are they good

Why does ur nose have like 8 angles
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:19:53

creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:32:04 Dude, why do you have an angle there
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:35:05 That's the reference imagine you said you used you ding dong🗿🗿🗿


That sht looks like it was built from memory

F-35 at home lookin ass
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:37:28 🤯🔥🔥
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:39:41 He asked for feedback then got mad when he got it, even got so insecure that he asked me to send my own builds
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:42:43 After you called me a whitename for telling u to fix the spine, your argument is still invalid 🗿
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:45:52 It has the rcs of a fully clean F-18 with no weapons 🗿
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:48:29 It's not horrible for a 4.5 gen **prototype** version of the su57, it's still stealthier than all the 4th gen fighters
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:50:35 It's actually considered a 4.5 gen fighter

<@883063424614006878> that guy makes everything funnier
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:54:19 I mean you can't compare it to western stealth technology lmao,  a hornet with its expected loadout would be around 10 M^2 RCS or more, a su 57 would be about 1 m^2, it is stealthy but not comparable to the j-20, F-22 or the F-35, significantly more stealthy than any 4th gen fighter when they're actually used for it's intended purpose and not airshows
creations-chat 2022-10-14 01:58:10 <@294980570885390346> can u make a eurofighter typhoon btw
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:00:56 Idk lmao ur the good builder here, this is the only good one I've seen https://youtu.be/JM30KviKt-U
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:03:04 eh

I mean sure, it's good
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:05:06 He had to sacrifice the engine spacing for the correct body proportions



The eurofighter has a weird body, it gets larger starting from the nose down
creations-chat 2022-10-14 02:07:40 He's already confirmed he's making a eurofighter, he just hasn't said it yet <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:32:51 The languages that like only a few hundred thousand ppl speak
creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:36:43 I'm guessing alot of them have English hammered into their heads
 

English speakers really don't need another language, it's really necessary for them

creations-chat 2022-10-14 03:45:51 ur IP doesn't show ur exact address, usually just the city ur in



I grabbed my friend's IP and it showed the mall where he bought his phone
general 2022-10-14 03:47:25 You might be able to dig up other info using someone's IP, an IP itself is kinda useless

creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:11:35 And why is it not allowed?
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:14:58 Is this game also banned? https://youtu.be/CPdJRUffro8
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:19:01 It couldn't legally infringe on plane crazy's "copyright" if that even exists if it's not a direct copy, that's just really stupid
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:21:13 can we talk about other games or is it only advertising when we're talking about the rival game 🤔
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:23:16 so other games don't count as advertising yet this one does?<:BIG1:588443768806703124>
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:25:21 so the plane crazy devs are just salty, maybe if they actually updated their game for once it wouldn't be competing with them lmao
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:28:59 Every fps shooter is also a cod copy
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:33:16 I really hope you realize that Roblox developers don't actually own the assets used in their games


Everything is owned by Roblox, the developers uses the assets given to them by Roblox, it can't be legally be considered a copy when you don't own it in the first place
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:35:51 basically

creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:57:59 I can def see why there's a cool down, I wish it was a bit shorter though
creations-chat 2022-10-14 16:00:01 There's plane crazy in Hong Kong?
creations-chat 2022-10-14 16:02:25 So there's a different version for the rest of china, just not Hong Kong 🤔
creations-chat 2022-10-14 16:23:38 Bro, you got debunked
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:24:55 you can't copy something that you don't own, they're the ones that said the other game infringed on plane crazy's copyright
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:25:53 my point still stands
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:26:29 they said it infringed on plane crazy's copyright
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:26:42 Fuzzy
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:28:51 Roblox owns it the game, you can't copy assets from another game, that's the thing
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:31:29 I don't think a topic like that is dependent on morality
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 16:31:59 But fair point

Bro, it's a good build
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:22:11 It's a good build
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:24:18 <@448677698773057547> bro you haven't posted anything in almost 2 years 🗿

Ur last was January 2021
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:26:36 <@448677698773057547> that's sum he'd do
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:28:46 What's wrong with the proportions though, the only thing I see that's off is the engine spacing
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:37:27 I think the nose itself is accurate, its just missing that small space between the canopy and the nose
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:40:50 It doesn't have canopy frames though

I think that's just where the cylinders clipped together
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:43:00 he just didn't angle it enough before locking

creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:42:52 gender theory is a relatively new topic which is also riddled with logical fallacies that are very easily exploited, that has never historically been recognized until now
creations-chat 2022-10-20 02:49:21 since it's a relatively new topic they haven't been mutually agreed upon, seccs and gender are used by the majority as the same thing and have always been used interchangeably

creations-chat 2022-11-03 11:51:40 💀?

How would they even end up in an f22
creations-chat 2022-11-03 11:54:12 ngl an f-35 could easily beat an f22 in a dogfight
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:07:07 well the f-22 actually needs to turn to shoot, it still could beat the F-35 under the correct conditions
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:45:28 The f-22 was also built without a helmet mounted display
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:51:25 It needs to point its nose to lock and shoot, an f-35 pilot only needs to look at it(the pilot can look through the jet and lock with it's 360° off boresight capabilities

<@448677698773057547> no, it isn't the F-35’s maneuverability is at least the equal of the F/A-18C in a totally clean configuration, which was the benchmark they were going for in the first place. Plus, the F-16 usually isn’t flying without bags or bombs, so an F-35 will probably outperform an F-16 in the real world. You're referencing that one combat test where the F-35 was extremely limited
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:53:43 It's not a UFO
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:55:56 It doesn't exactly dogfight, it just cheats at it
creations-chat 2022-11-03 12:58:17 It is better
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:00:45 The f-22 needs to turn, the f35 pilot needs to turn their head


<@1004207882784489472> exactly, it isn't made for dogfighting and isn't better than the f-22 at it, it still wins
creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:02:56 Dogfighting was what I said

It isn't better than the f-22 at it so it fucking cheats

creations-chat 2022-11-03 13:37:49 Thrust vectoring isn't useful in a dogfight, the f 22 was designed with the capabilities of excelling a 1 circle, 2 circle, vertical and rate fights etc to get the lock and shoot, you're comparing it to other jets with those capabilities in mind but aren't as good as the f-22, the F-35 doesn't need to fight for positioning, while the F-22 does, it literally doesn't need to turn while the f-22 does


The F-35 isn't as good as dogfighting yet it heavily makes up for that

creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:28:15 y'all are so inconsistent when enforcing, ppl send memes here and and other Roblox games and there doesn't seem to be a problem

No, this is quite unreasonable
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:30:51 why do y'all have a problem with that game specifically, no one bats an eye when a different game is mentioned lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:32:54 They're in no way close to the same thing, both of these games are made using Roblox's assets which the game developers don't own, you can't copy something that doesn't belong to you
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:34:56 What? It being a mechanical building game? Every fps shooter is also a cod copy

You can't copy a genre my guy
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:37:36 completely avoiding the point by going after that small error in the comparison, classic
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:41:22 Wasn't plane crazy made before it though?
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:43:51 I don't see where they "stole" anything
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:46:06 And where is pc2?
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:48:23 has it been that long since pc2 has been announced that someone made a whole ass game from scratch in that time frame? Seems more likely that they've been working on it before

That's really the case then they deserved what happened lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:51:06 why only have a problem when only THAT game is posted, be consistent 💀
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:53:58 Banned it because it's the only other game that compares, I really hope you realize what you just said

Not even a copy or anything, it's just the same concept so it's banned
creations-chat 2022-11-05 23:58:17 So it's not a copy?
creations-chat 2022-11-06 00:01:24 everything is owned by Roblox, not the devs, you can't copy something if you don't own it, they're also completely different games

You must be like 14 if you genuinely think that
creations-chat 2022-11-06 00:04:23 Arguments are important

And you're basically calling the rule itself stupid
creations-chat 2022-11-06 00:06:47 That server is that server and this server is this server, stay here
creations-chat 2022-11-06 00:10:15 That game is also FAR more similar to trailmakers 💀

creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:22:53 It is
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:25:01 The design is really unique
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:27:40 bro said stolen nose shape, there's a reason 5th gens have that nose
It's in no way "stolen", it's just the most effective
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:30:11 it is
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:32:15 I also love propaganda, it's astonishing how many times this has been debunked yet people are still spewing this nonsense
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:35:01 you don't just copy another country's nose and slap it onto your own jet, it's not that simple, the entire structure and technology inside the nose are different sizes, fill a certain amount of space etc, the nose has to be made to compliment what's inside it

<@1004207882784489472> idk who that is
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:37:16 It's not

Not being as good as the f-22 or f35 doesn't make it shit 🗿
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:41:59 and where's the propeller
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:44:27 The f-22 is a bit overrated
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:47:18 It carries the AIM-9x yet it can't use it to it's full potential because it doesn't have a radar mounted sight and it's only limited to the airforce, it could realistically lose a dogfight to a cold war era Russian jet, dogfights dont really matter though

It's already about to get replaced by the NGAD program
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:49:21 That's why I said it doesn't really matter, I just brought up dogfights because it's seen as some god at it yet it would still need to drag targets into it's sight
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:53:14 Su 27
creations-chat 2022-11-07 23:56:23 idk man Russia got some pretty good missiles on Suhkoi jets
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:01:07 Migs are just giant pieces of metal, Suhkoi jets have alot more funding and potential

<@738448924368568360> I wasn't saying it was
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:03:37 That's a different time, sht was alot cheaper and simple, Suhkoi has a better adaptation to future technology
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:07:52 and how would they have a better chance against the f-22? 🗿
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:12:32 nah I said the su 27 lol
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:17:09 A su 27 wouldn't really stand a chance but it still "could" best the raptor even if it took out 10 before it
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:19:27 His videos aren't very accurate so I wouldn't use them as reference, I used a hypothetical dogfight scenerio

Do I need to? The su 27 gets shat on while the pilots are cracking jokes with each other over the radio
creations-chat 2022-11-08 00:22:52 ofc it would 🗿

I was just saying, if it had some kind of magical cloaking device until it got to visual range

creations-chat 2022-11-10 04:59:41 I don't like defending it but that's the old a10 where the pilots had to eyeball their targets, that isn't an issue anymore with the newer models
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:03:35 I don't think they hated it
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:05:50 I'm pretty sure most pilots love the a10
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:08:01 yeah I'm well aware of the capabilities of the a10, some of it's criticisms may not be fair though
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:11:18 It's main purpose is close air support when there's already dominance, there's not really another attack aircraft that could properly fill it's role
creations-chat 2022-11-10 05:13:39 which are more expensive to operate


<@900649045813493810> yeah, they wanna replace it with the f35

creations-chat 2022-11-18 01:42:49 I personally think it looks better than the f-22 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-11-18 01:46:00 The j-20 detected an F-35 a few months ago admitted by a US general, he even said the j-20 pilots were impressive

general 2022-11-18 01:52:16 You think it looks ugly, I think it looks good, that's what an option is, it's subjective
general 2022-11-18 01:53:40 US army General Wilsbach says otherwise
general 2022-11-18 01:54:39 Well he's an actual qualified aviation expert
general 2022-11-18 01:55:22 Because
general 2022-11-18 01:55:36 We're comparing US and Chinese aircrafts
general 2022-11-18 01:56:01 In this case, F-35s were detected by a j-20
general 2022-11-18 01:57:03 😗
general 2022-11-18 01:57:47 man I wish that were the case, china has some really capable missiles
general 2022-11-18 01:58:24 any actual reason?
general 2022-11-18 01:58:40 They aren't in any way similar to the US missiles

general 2022-11-18 02:06:10 The F-22 is only in the US airforce, same situation as the f20
general 2022-11-18 02:06:59 the j-20's rcs are estimates, it's not public knowledge currently
general 2022-11-18 02:08:03 what 4 external fuel tanks, the F-22 can carry weapons externally going by your logic
general 2022-11-18 02:08:40 It can be equipped, so does the F-35
general 2022-11-18 02:09:46 😗

general 2022-11-18 02:28:53 I mean there's a difference between aet and animation, some anime also used CGI
general 2022-11-18 02:32:40 Is CGI art?

creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:46:44 I support Russia but they're drafting civilians out of the health and age requirements, literally air dropping them on the front lines with 0 training meanwhile there's hundreds of thousands of reserves

Including old and disabled people
general 2022-11-19 23:49:17 <@700761272282775593> the current su 57 is a prototype

general 2022-11-19 23:51:56 what? Bro yeah ofc lmao
general 2022-11-19 23:52:06 That's not the point
general 2022-11-19 23:53:50 there's hardly any in service, the ones that are literally aren't being used, the su 57 productions have been severely delayed because of Russia's declining economy and due to it being heavily annexed
general 2022-11-19 23:54:17 I do stand with Russia
general 2022-11-19 23:54:35 They have 12, not 12 in service

creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:42:42 dawg the jets don't suck, the US and Russia are in two completely different leagues
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:45:23 What doesn't suck that isn't made by the US
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:48:05 Those aren't as capable as US fighters, therefore they suck
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:50:35 So flankers suck, just not migs?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:54:57 Idk if you're aware of this but Russia is literally strapping hardly trained pilots and infantry into contested territory meanwhile there's still hundreds of thousands of qualified personnel in reserve

the majority of the newer Russian forces on the front lines are untrained
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:57:06 Address my point please

creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:49:53 bro hand picked one of his worst builds

creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:59:02 <@1004207882784489472> bro just stfu and look at this f22 raptor
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:01:16 Let's just ignore the fact that the j20 was made for air superiority and the f35 a multi role fighter for anything but air superiority which can also go on carriers
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:04:38 bro I'm really not trynna argue about expert ranks or plane crazy builds, that shit just gets toxic and unproductive 🗿
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:07:05 I'm really not trynna prove anything

Also it's a dying Roblox game, I hardly even have time to play it, quite unimportant
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:09:15 yeah I'm not gonna learn my lesson by getting dog pilied on by some Roblox players, arguing about jets and shit is much more fun
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:12:02 That's cool but j20>plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:14:22 Alot of people call it a Chinese knockoff, it was made with some western technology tbf

My reactions just kicked in lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:16:25 It's a knockoff su 57 too now?🗿
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:18:33 One of the best custom jets I've seen, nice
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:21:02 
creations-chat 2022-11-22 21:35:23 ?
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:24:45 It's a prototype, it's not the final product, productions have been halted because Russia is being heavily annexed which is ruining their economy

<@658318819248570381> because it's not the final product 🗿
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:27:48 and no, I'm not a fanboy, I just don't diss prototypes

the f-22 and f35 was similar in their early days, the F-35's software was also heavily limited, that shit could hardly turn but look at it now
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:31:02 And where are the su 57s currently being used? There's a whole war going on and it's Russia's 5th gen jet, it's not operational enough

The entire point of a 5th gen fighter is to gather information, share with other 5th gens and make strategical advantages based on said information, the su 57 doesn't have nearly enough production numbers for use of it's full extent
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:36:42 Yeah you're the kinda guy to believe the first shit that pops up on Google, that's why ur info is so wrong, that was never confirmed by Russia, there's been a silhouette resembling a su 57 spotted over Ukraine that was never confirmed to be a su 57, it also looked like other flankers in comparison
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:39:27 mf what Slavic kid on tiktok 🗿 its not like this is public information gathered by different sources, it has to be some Slavic kid on tiktok
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:48:30 I mean the Russian economy was already in a bad state, they do have plans of ordering more

<@660725956935286789> I think they got more fairly recently
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:52:39 The earliest model of the F-35 was also in serial production, that sht could hardly do 6g turns

The same one that got dusted by the f16 in a combat test
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:55:48 I mean it's 2 different types of problems for 2 different types of planes, both were prototypes which at the time hasn't seen it's full potential
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:00:37 I mean this is the best channel for debates and stuff, shit would be too crazy without slow mode
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:11:10 Because it's a PROTOTYPE

Lemme make it easier to understand for you, it's a WIP build, it's not finished yet


Also it's estimated RCS is that of an F-18 super hornet carrying no weapons, certainly harder to detect than other 4th gen fighters

Bro you know you've lost when you resort to insults lmao
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:29:31 <@883063424614006878> btw how stealthy were the literalfirst models of the f-22
help 2022-11-22 23:31:58 First u gotta figure out what u wanna angle lock
help 2022-11-22 23:32:35 The spine?
help 2022-11-22 23:33:30 the su 35 has multiple angles in it's spine which would require piston lock
help 2022-11-22 23:33:47 I'd recommend a jet with a more straight spine first
help 2022-11-22 23:34:59 u can put it on top of the motorlock tower
help 2022-11-22 23:36:47 Aso angle lock guides on yt
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:51:38 So you don't know basically

<@1001100269699997916> ice
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:54:20 because the US has always had a better economy, they can actually afford to produce fighters at the moment
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:56:44 "su 57 isn't stealthy" Who would've thought jets would be bad in their early stages of development, the F35 could hardly turn just a few years ago
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:58:59 Exactly
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:01:17 The airframe couldn't sustain high G turns, that was the problem, it couldn't turn, many other jets can do more than their 9g limit but their airframe just can't sustain it

So it's capped at 9gs basically


What exactly
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:06:48 How do you sustain something with precaution, do you know what sustain means?

How do you sustain 10Gs with precaution
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:10:16 How do you SUSTAIN over 9G's with precaution, you can go over it with precaution but not sustain

<@641439058719014913> the F-35 is listed as a 9G+ fighter, it can go slightly over
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:15:41 The F-35's G force isn't classified, that information is relayed to the governments of different countries that buy it
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:18:07 There's also alot of specifications of the f 35 in it's yearly reports
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:20:44 Yep, the f-16 is only more maneuverable when isn't carrying any weapons
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:25:58 well it also does ground attacks and reconnaissance so it's pretty important

Maneuverability is less important for something like the F-22 because it isn't primarily a multi role fighter
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:28:43 yes, cobras are fucking cool
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:02:11 no, it's not complete
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:06:29 The first incomplete model of the F35 had serials


Bro y'all are coming at me in waves, my brain is fried at this point
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:22:15 well it was one of the earliest F-35 models delivered to the USAF called the F-35 AF-02

creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:06:42 what
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:09:29 I don't think so

Dawg you did the exact same thing
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:11:45 By saying it was a competent argument
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:15:48 but there's alot of other factors which determines what makes a better aircraft than simply how many missiles it can carry, I'd personally go by the versatility of each aircraft, the fact that the f-35 is a cheaper multi role fighter which is used by the USAF, the navy and the Marines and other NATO countries where as the f-22 is isolated to 1 country, 1 branch of the military and it being hardly used since it's more expensive and it was originally built for a conflict that never happened

Idk where or how dogfights got into a conversation about 5th gen fighters, it isn't that simple as s_suri said
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:19:09 Could Sweden ever outmatch US technology?

creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:33:22 banner worthy
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:40:25 Also no, low rcs doesn't = stealth
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:42:46 are marbles stealthy?
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:45:32 But it's smaller than a golf ball
creations-chat 2022-12-01 03:50:57 I don't think the rcs determines if an aircraft is stealthy or not, a smaller rcs is a result of a combination of stealth characters, a marble would have a small rcs but that doesn't make it stealthy since a marble doesn't have stealth characteristics is basically what I'm saying

If that makes sense
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:01:51 Yep, still would also need to avoid infrared detection even with a low rcs
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:05:25 An f-35 could be as low rcs as it wants but if it couldn't mask the heat produced by it's engines then it's still gonna be a glowing orb on radar
creations-chat 2022-12-01 04:09:23 on gog?

I mean fighters mask their heat specifically to avoid those along with heat seeking missiles

general 2022-12-03 20:59:20 Nothing any other countries have even comes close tho the capabilities of the f35, the F22 costs significantly more to operate per hour and the maintenance, the f35 is far more efficient and has superior data linking technology
general 2022-12-03 20:59:57 And how is that a counterpoint
general 2022-12-03 21:00:09 I know other countries have the f35
general 2022-12-03 21:01:17 Other NATO countries have the f35, no country that the US is in conflict with owns the f35 so how is that a bad thing
general 2022-12-03 21:01:52 🤦
general 2022-12-03 21:03:30 Therefore the f35 is better
general 2022-12-03 21:04:09 the a10 isn't used against air defense
general 2022-12-03 21:05:17 it's not used against air defense, it's designed for CAS you plum
general 2022-12-03 21:05:49 This isn't about the su 25💀
general 2022-12-03 21:06:12 Dude you're so fucking dumb Jesus Christ
general 2022-12-03 21:06:51 We're talking about the a10
general 2022-12-03 21:07:43 It's designed for CAS when air superiority is already established, the USAF aren't gonna throw it into contested airspace because that's not what it was designed for
general 2022-12-03 21:09:38 And how many have been shot down during the Russia Ukraine war because it's being used against air defense? It's being thrown into contested airspace as a multi role fighter meanwhile there's still anti aircraft artillery and actual fighter jets, Ukraine hardly had any operational su 25s left because of this
general 2022-12-03 21:11:20 Lil bro, it's anti air defense artillery and fighter jets vs a CAS plane, the su 25 is already doing horribly because it's in contested airspace, that's not what it was designed for, it's the exact same thing with the a 10
general 2022-12-03 21:12:39 Dawg if ur gonna argue give actual points, "the a10 sucks" "the frogfoot better" you're saying absolutely nothing
general 2022-12-03 21:13:39 A massive target which flies in circles in the same area, doesn't sound like a good idea
general 2022-12-03 21:14:10 The a10 is significantly smaller and more maneuverable
general 2022-12-03 21:14:41 You say nothing of value
general 2022-12-03 21:15:35 "the a10 sucks" "the frogfoot better" you still haven't said why
general 2022-12-03 21:16:17 it's being shot down in rates significantly higher
general 2022-12-03 21:17:13 It was shot down in rates significantly higher than the a10 in operation desert storm
general 2022-12-03 21:18:24 Dude it's used for CAS not strike missions
general 2022-12-03 21:18:37 Literally against small arms fire
general 2022-12-03 21:19:35 not against enemy air defense
general 2022-12-03 21:20:20 Wings torn off
general 2022-12-03 21:20:35 <@1004207882784489472> also what's with that vid u sent of that f35
general 2022-12-03 21:20:55 context?
general 2022-12-03 21:21:27 Is the landing gear supposed to be dragged by a truck?
general 2022-12-03 21:22:15 and how many malfunctions did the f16 and f15 have in the same time the f35 has served, significantly more
general 2022-12-03 21:22:36 A truck can take down an f22 if you ram it
general 2022-12-03 21:22:45 Not surprising
general 2022-12-03 21:23:21 do I smell reformer?
general 2022-12-03 21:23:58 Bro you've read too many clickbait articles and no, Pierre Sprey isn't a valid source for your criticism
general 2022-12-03 21:26:26 I can tell he read the first line of that f35 getting destroyed by the f16 in a dogfight artico
general 2022-12-03 21:27:01 exactly
general 2022-12-03 21:27:10 <@1004207882784489472> ?
general 2022-12-03 21:27:28 <@1004207882784489472> ?
general 2022-12-03 21:27:42 Took down by a rookie pilot
general 2022-12-03 21:28:49 F35 has 1 accident and this mf loses his shit, that's what happens when you're developing a plane
general 2022-12-03 21:29:33 dawg I don't care, I personally prefer the f35
general 2022-12-03 21:30:14 I wouldn't say I love it, much of it's criticism is just unwanted
general 2022-12-03 21:30:23 It's a prototype
general 2022-12-03 21:30:57 Why? Because of rivets? I can show u an early version of the f35 which doesn't look very stealthy
general 2022-12-03 21:31:24 prototype
general 2022-12-03 21:31:32 not the final product
general 2022-12-03 21:31:43 no, it isn't
general 2022-12-03 21:32:20 Where is the su 57 being used
general 2022-12-03 21:32:23 Airshows?
general 2022-12-03 21:32:39 The engines haven't been replaced yet
general 2022-12-03 21:33:45 Dawg, are dogfights even a thing anymore?
general 2022-12-03 21:34:10 Brother thinks this is the 1970's
general 2022-12-03 21:35:12 Dude, this ain't the 1970's, what dogfights am I supposed to reference
general 2022-12-03 21:36:07 I think a pilot would much rather survive than take a dogfight which they aren't trained for
general 2022-12-03 21:37:21 I'm really sorry you think modern day combat is boring, why don't you send an f14 meanwhile over the horizon hypersonic missiles exists
general 2022-12-03 21:38:17 dawg if y'all don't see how dumb morfix is after what he just said
general 2022-12-03 21:38:51 Brother this ain't dcs, what dogfights 💀
general 2022-12-03 21:40:09 i don't care
general 2022-12-03 21:40:41 brother you use insults over logic lmao
general 2022-12-03 21:41:24 Doesn't it kinda have lazers already
general 2022-12-03 21:41:59 So combat lazers
general 2022-12-03 21:42:54 The US has flankers <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-12-03 21:43:19 No idea how they got them but they have them
general 2022-12-03 21:44:01 I've seen them use a su 35 in a dogfight simulation
general 2022-12-03 21:44:19 I think it was against a super hornet
general 2022-12-03 21:45:55 They were actually dogfighting
general 2022-12-03 21:46:01 Just without the shooting part
general 2022-12-03 21:50:43 Yes, the f35 can shoot off boresight, I don't need quora to prove that, it's common knowledge
general 2022-12-03 21:51:15 and yes, it can shoot a plane directly behind it
general 2022-12-03 21:52:53 public information, the f35 can shoot off boresight, how do you even deny that
general 2022-12-03 21:53:22 I can pull up multiple credible sources if you want
general 2022-12-03 21:53:57 No way they called a su 75 a su 27
general 2022-12-03 21:56:06 <@1004207882784489472> https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/f-35-stealth-fighter-tests-%E2%80%98aircraft-killer%E2%80%99-missiles-17847
general 2022-12-03 21:56:48 Aim9x + hmcs + being able to look through fuselage= kill plane directly behind it
general 2022-12-03 21:57:56 The pilot locks it lol

general 2022-12-05 01:42:29 Desired posting the same pic of his wip build 10 times a day
general 2022-12-05 02:17:18 I also hate when ppl like something I don't
general 2022-12-05 02:17:46 How
general 2022-12-05 02:18:19 Playing genshin is like moderating a discord server, ah yes
general 2022-12-05 02:18:45 I got nothing that can run genshin lol
general 2022-12-05 02:19:14 I don't see how it's bad
general 2022-12-05 02:19:46 So you're generalizing basically, that's not a very good thing to do
general 2022-12-05 02:20:23 there you go, anything you say from now on is invalid
general 2022-12-05 02:20:46 well your argument justifies racism
general 2022-12-05 02:21:45 generalizing directly justifies racism
general 2022-12-05 02:21:57 that's one of the main causes of racism
general 2022-12-05 02:22:26 that ain't my intention
general 2022-12-05 02:22:41 You're judging an entire community based on a minority
general 2022-12-05 02:22:48 therefore you're generalizing
general 2022-12-05 02:23:14 you defended generalizing which is one of the main causes of racism
general 2022-12-05 02:23:33 😗
general 2022-12-05 02:23:58 I'm not calling you racist lol
general 2022-12-05 02:24:30 I assume you like gaming, alot of gamers are fat and ugly
general 2022-12-05 02:25:37 What if I said all gamers are fat and ugly, that obviously wouldn't be true, like you did with discord mods and genshin players
general 2022-12-05 02:26:07 have you met the majority of them?
general 2022-12-05 02:26:32 you're the one making these negative assumptions
general 2022-12-05 02:27:06 <:BIG1:588443768806703124>
general 2022-12-05 02:27:27 Yeah that says it all right there
general 2022-12-05 02:28:51 If stereotypes didn't have some truth they wouldn't exist, alr then
general 2022-12-05 02:29:36 Well stereotypes could be made out of a lack of understanding
general 2022-12-05 02:30:00 He said all
general 2022-12-05 02:30:39 I like how he's going back on what he said
general 2022-12-05 02:31:33 And you wonder why I say it justifies racism
general 2022-12-05 02:32:32 U have an anime pfp, therefore you're a fat basement dweller
general 2022-12-05 02:33:56 There we go, you just killed your entire argument
general 2022-12-05 02:35:13 you dont know the majority, therefore you're invalid by making these generalizations, anime pfps being fat losers is a stereotype, you said you're an acception
general 2022-12-05 02:35:54 Because you said you're an acception, therefore it doesn't represent an entire community
general 2022-12-05 02:36:38 which is incorrect because you said you're an acception .-.
general 2022-12-05 02:37:35 If you're an acception then obviously not all anime pfps are fat and ugly, therefore your generalization is invalid
general 2022-12-05 02:38:35 And who are you to say the majority of them are something, you don't know the majority of them 💀
general 2022-12-05 02:39:05 Agreed
general 2022-12-05 02:39:52 <:m_:778994206948589638>
general 2022-12-05 02:40:58 Death penalties too <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2022-12-05 02:42:02 It costs significantly more to house criminals for life and keep them alive with tax dollars
general 2022-12-05 02:43:39 People are generally kept in prisons for decades before execution
general 2022-12-05 02:44:55 I think that could explain the higher cost, they're still in prisons for a really long time prior
general 2022-12-05 02:45:01 Also source?
general 2022-12-05 02:47:21 Btw I think this is also excluding the cost of maintenance that comes with keeping an prisoner, their clothes, sheets, sewage system etc
general 2022-12-05 02:47:50 my brain ain't working rn
general 2022-12-05 02:47:59 Bro I asked u for the source lol
general 2022-12-05 02:48:52 Pug ended up in my dms for any minor conflict

creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:15:42 
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:21:30 What jet did they copy lol
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:26:21 I can definitely see why you think its copied but you'd have very limited options during the design process
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:29:05 I assume you're just talking out of your ass lol
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:32:52 Yeah that's not really applicable to new generation fighters, I might not explain it well but there's alot of considerations you need to make which often leads to them looking similar, it's not like older aircraft where you can just add a wing sweep instead of canards or sum


<@448677698773057547> flankers aren't new generation aircrafts
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:39:08 Well it's pretty easy to say "that's not how it works" without any points to prove why but I'm sure you can see a similarity here, or did they all just copy the f22
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:43:15 Where else should they put that line?

Yeah I don't think their goal is to be creative, they aren't concerned if it looks too much like another jet or not, it's placed where it's most effective
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:45:44 The point of it is to divert lightning strikes from the electronics in the nose, best way to do that is to equally distribute it to the fuselage

<@641439058719014913> nah south Korea too?
Cuz they did it
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:49:48 how else should they divert lightning strikes lmao, run the line through the canopy and under the plane?

but nah every modern fighter design copied the f22
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:54:20 China has copied US technology, I know
creations-chat 2022-12-05 16:10:05 yep

It diverts it from the tip of the nose where the radar and stuff is
creations-chat 2022-12-05 16:12:45 ?role @<@706717603258957864>  Expert Supreme
creations-chat 2022-12-05 16:16:55 Well it can still be damaged, you still wouldn't want the impact focused on one area so the purpose of that is to divert it
creations-chat 2022-12-05 17:22:01 
creations-chat 2022-12-05 20:13:09 How does that affect this f-35

creations-chat 2023-01-17 23:08:06 To be fair I don't think he actually killed an f22, that a 10 is from the demo team which they use for show, prob just slapped a bunch of stickers on it
creations-chat 2023-01-17 23:10:19 The Eurofighter Typhoon did kill the f22 multiple times tho in a partnering red flag exercise with Germany in 2012
creations-chat 2023-01-17 23:13:12 Yeah it's capabilities have only really been proven in red flag exercises

It was built for a fight which didn't end up happening

creations-chat 2023-02-02 12:38:46 did ranks have any value in the first place?
creations-chat 2023-02-02 12:41:37 the problem is that you're placing value in a system that faulty
creations-chat 2023-02-02 13:36:02 
creations-chat 2023-02-03 19:49:41 There might be an f16 vs su 57 some time in the future lol

Nvm I remembered that there's less than 10 combat operational su 57's
creations-chat 2023-02-03 20:03:14 it's the same as a hornet carrying nothing externally*
creations-chat 2023-02-03 20:05:41 y'all are just looking at it's rcs as it's fixed specification, the rcs depends on the angle in which you're seeing the plane, it could be less with proper ways of decreasing

It's rcs is also less than an f-16 so
creations-chat 2023-02-03 20:09:03 the su 57 has a pretty good radar too, it won't have a problem detecting when the f16 gets close enough to it's range, the su 57 would def be more difficult to detect

Assuming the f16's will even have a chance to take off because runways will be a primary target by the russians
creations-chat 2023-02-03 20:11:27 are you gonna post the su 57's rivets as a response


Didn't they say Ukraine was getting f16's in a few months?

su 57 still solos🥱
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:00:10 not true lol, rcs constantly changes depending on the position of the aircraft, the largest estimate of the su 57's rcs is the same rcs as an f18 carring no external weapons
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:04:00 having kills doesn't determine its actual effectiveness though, just look the f22 lol
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:08:33 looks are subjective so I really can't have a problem with how good you think it looks 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:15:31 it's not a stealth fighter yet they've managed to make the rcs less than a clean F-18 even with the su 57's engines and shit, I think that's pretty impressive

everything is gonna seem like dogshit if u keep comparing it to the US
creations-chat 2023-02-28 14:21:24 Russia just wants to say they have a "stealth fighter" by making a handful of them lol

creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:39:55 and how does that change the fact that 1 wides are an acceptable way to avoid making a nose and correct dimensions
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:46:45 F14 was ass lol
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:50:16 Saying the f14 is trash = felon fan, bro has top gun logic
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:52:18 The felon isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be, y'all just love western propaganda


Not f22 or f35 level but yeah

We could continue this in like 45mins when I get home, school wifi is trash
creations-chat 2023-03-01 16:57:24 If only you knew Russia outclasses even the US in bvr missiles

RCS isn't a set value, it constantly changes depending on the orientation of the aircraft, the largest estimate is that of an F-18 carrying nothing externally

*The largest estimate*
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:00:47 also the cost of an F-14D adjusted for today's inflation puts 1 of them at about 200mil, not including maintenance cost

The f14 doesn't match the performance for that price, you could almost buy 2 f35s with that money
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:05:25 Idk what that's supposed to prove

What does that have to do with the combat operational one

Also a comparison with an f35???
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:08:28 you aren't actually making an argument by getting a random image from Google of an unspecified su 57 variant
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:02:27 it's of course gonna be shit if you're comparing it to an f-35, that's like
saying an assault rifle is shit cuz it's not as powerful as a sniper rifle, despite being much bigger than an f-18 it maintains a smaller rcs than an F-18 even while carrying nothing externally. Making a plane that's larger than the F-18 smaller than it on radar is quite impressive but you're comparing it to the extremes
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:13:19 tell me what good builds I've downvoted, I'll wait
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:40:21 you don't need to be at a certain skill to downvote stuff though lmao, I'm not gonna not downvote something just because someone's better than me, that makes no sense
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:43:08 1 wide
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:45:51 I also don't play the game so I don't really care who's better than me at it 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:48:29 
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:50:48 your logic is picked apart very easily lol

"Don't criticize something if you can't do better" those su 57 haters better be able to build a better one irl

creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:57:26 and if I had the same about of skill and play time I could definitely do better than some of those jets I've downvoted, your point being? lmao

you shouldn't rely on the hypothetical cuz it could also directly go against your entire point, that's not a sound argument you're making
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:01:10 you could say a plane doesn't have a strong radar because of a history of malfunctions or some other factor, you don't need to be able to build one yourself in order to criticize it🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:34:11 Tomcat mfs on their way to discuss why their 4th gen which costs almost as much as an f22 and harder to maintain than an f35 is actually good:
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:43:23 people complain about the f35 being expensive, meanwhile this old ass that costs twice an f35A and can't do 1/10th of the sht the f35 can
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:48:14 laginator 5000
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:50:16 yeah think one variant of it costed like 200mil once, idk how they managed to cheaper then alot of 4th gens

creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:52:45 no, it's not, 1 stud isn't 1 mile, a stud is like 1 step
creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:55:01 are we measuring the speed of a Roblox player or the creation 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:27:12 when you're traveling in a car does mph measure the speed of the vehicle or the person inside it
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:30:21 what makes it different?
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:34:21 therefore it's the speed of the jet, not the player, the jet keeps moving lol
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:37:39 arguments are fun
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:42:19 Mph measures the speed of a person and also vehicles, if the jet can move independently of the player then how is it only showing the speed of the player?

The player could be completely stationary and it shows 0 meanwhile the jet is still moving, also I can assure you I'm not mad lol

creations-chat 2023-07-15 19:58:23 We needa teach em a lesson again
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:05:54 Wouldn't be a slur if they didn't exist <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:08:41 Cis is a slur too and they use it without question lol
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:11:53 It's insulting to alot of people, it's a slur if I follow your logic

I don't like being called cis either
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:14:14 faulty comparison
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:16:54 and that's why slurs are pretty dumb, if a group of ppl decide they find a word offensive then it's a slur, no arguing with it, ppl should be able to say whatever they wanna say
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:19:01 does the tone really matter when someone doesn't wanna be called that?


Arguments aren't a bad thing 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-07-15 20:23:07 Also the person using "cis" doesn't get to decide if it's offensive or not lol

May be a regular word to some people yet offensive to others
creations-chat 2023-07-15 21:46:19 exactly why they're dumb
creations-chat 2023-07-15 22:19:40 Who's gonna tell em free speech doesn't apply in private domains?

creations-chat 2023-07-15 22:26:55 forcing ppl to accept them is just a habit of theirs lol, I'm just glad I'm in one of the few western countries that aren't yet corrupted by them
