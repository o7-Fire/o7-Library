plane-crazy 2020-05-20 00:00:39 (yes the one from the clone wars)
help 2020-05-20 04:48:06 what's a good way to generate lift on something rlly weird and where the CoM is in a rlly bad spot? I've tried hover thrusters and rockets engines, I just flip everywhere or don't move at all
help 2020-05-20 04:48:19 (build is a zenuas 33 umbaran starfighter)
help 2020-05-20 04:48:42 so far I've settled on a hover drive to lift a bit but I want it to fly like a plane more instead of floating

creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:39:23 <@311088693412888576> the "sky snakes" are called shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:39:45 and you can only counter with speed, small size, armor, or a shredder bug of your own
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:40:04 I chose the last choice

plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:22:14 well, I'm making it in the style of a 737 but it won't work as a 737
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:22:27 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:22:33 majority likes 2
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:22:51 people said 1 looks too long
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:21 people seem to like 2 because it's short and don't like 1 because it's long xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:28 but yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:31 I do like 1 and 3
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:26:21 1 is the longest, 2 is medium, 3 is shortest
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:26:45 1 is the longest and 3 is the shortest
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:13 I tried to capture a 737 in general, so 737-8
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:15 I guess
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:27 it's heavily modified so it's really not a 737
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:52 but yeah I like to think of it as a 737-8
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:59 imagine 737 max xd
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:28:05 yeah
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:28:07 that's what I feel
creations-chat 2020-07-06 03:28:25 but it sort of doesn't fit with like the feel of a 737-8

plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:30:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:30:59 it's to control too much upward pitch
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:17 because the engine is a bit above the wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:34 it makes the nose go up

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:03:39 a
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:08:17 vk system is a terrible idea, what if you're doing good in pvp and the newbies who are now salty kick you just because you're better than them?
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:08:24 vk can be so easily abused
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:08:56 now salty*
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:09:10 mhm but when you're dominating an entire pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:09:15 if you're a tryhard like me
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:10:08 oh yeah, so I'm pissing them off by being better than them?
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:10:10 wth?
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:10:21 it just shows that you need to get good
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:11:06 pissing off everyone in the server by being good = they are just bad
pissing everyone off in the server because you're annoying and toxic = sure votekick
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:11:47 because of the noobs pvp is boring and isn't a challenge
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:10 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:18 the ultimate challenge
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:34 darmag
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:36 face it
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:42 vk can be too easily abused
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:12:47 by those who are salty
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:14:47 sure vk may be the best way to kick someone that's actually being bad, but it's just too easily abused.
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:15:04 there is a better way of there's an exploiter or some idiots
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:15:08 you can server hop
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:15:36 also, public servers are laggy as shit, so join the private servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:16:14 you realize this is plane crazy and there's not much point in exploiting in this game
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:16:15 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:16:19 if this was arsenal
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:16:20 sure

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:04:34 because it look weird sir
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:13 the hull is blocky but decent for a first ship
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:20 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:20 Is it your first ship
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:29 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:35 I think hull needs more shape
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:54 e
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:54 it's blocky
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:02 can we get a front view
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:29 everything above the deck is fine, I couldn't do better than that
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:38 the hull threw me off
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:25 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:54 ok not bad
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:57 now post that
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:46 bit rectangular, you could have the hull move inward consistently instead of just going inward then outward
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:13 however that looks more stable
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:16 than my fletch
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:22 which has smoler hull
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:38 if something that big is for pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:51 then you probably either have a gamer setup
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:58 or it's empty
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:05 because that is going to lag
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:37 I have a 3k+ part fletcher and it's really just for looks, flexing, and for me to improve skills
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:46 I probably won't use it for pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:54 because it is laggy as frick

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:05:54 the cockpit doesnt drop
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:06:02 that would be nauseous for the pilots
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:06:15 only the nose droops for more visibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:06:19 not the cockpit
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:06:36 its a second window and the immediate nose that droop
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:06:41 <@!342402058994974730>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:08:23 <@!342402058994974730> i recommend you see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9yAROE3s1M

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:09:09 does the nose move?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:09:10 yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:09:29 does a second window which can be mistaken for the cockpit move?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:09:31 y e s .
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:12:33 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:31 yes i know what the droop snoot does
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:37 it provides pilot visiibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:52 yes is a snoot a cockpit?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:10 if the cockpit drooped in real life, which you are saying
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:18 the pilots would droop down too
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:25 and they would mess up the landing angle
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:34 resulting in possible danger
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:48 the pilots and flight deck d o n o t m o v e
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:52 only the nose
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:57 the nose cone to be exact
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:00 and a second windo
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:06 the snoot
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:08 refers to
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:35 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:40 everything highlighted in red
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:46 is the snout/nose/snoot
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:57 the cockpit does NOT NEED TO DROOP FOR PILOT VISIBILITY.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:09 the problem with concorde's long nose is that it limited visibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:18 yes it has a secondary windshield nannoc
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:21 and i have made that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:13 but anyway slayer
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:22 drooping the cockpit and pilots would literally mean
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:23 that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:32 the pilots would have a diff angle from the plane
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:36 messing up landing angle
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:42 and possible accident
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:12 you see the problem with the concorde was that the long aerodynamic nose blocked visibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:21 so they drooped the nose so the pilots could see
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:24 simple
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:28 i know there are innacuracies
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:34 i.e. the wings
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:59 yes you said my plane had errors

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:00 here is not drooped
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:08 when the concorde's nose isnt drooped
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:16 the window is literally one
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:26 such as this
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:32 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:36:27 when it has drooped, the window moves out of the way, but i cannot move it into the nose cone like irl because i dont have the space on this mini concorde. <@!342402058994974730>

help 2020-10-18 23:11:01 if its nose heavy than why isnt it just staying in a dive?
help 2020-10-18 23:13:48 theyre at the top of the motor lock tower

creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:49:46 it isnt an exact copy i only needed some help on the elevators and he let me use the nose from before
the wings, fuselage, systems i did myself
misinformation on the permissions, i deleted the build it ok
bruh you can check it again the fuselage and other stuff is not even close
general 2020-10-20 02:51:06 <@!590366350065795072> did no mean to sowwy, just needed some guidance
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:51:21 when i asked you like a week ago on the first phantom i did
i asked you how it worked and you showed me
general 2020-10-20 02:51:58 dude
general 2020-10-20 02:52:10 i thought i got perms from way before but apparently not
general 2020-10-20 02:52:15 i have deleted the build relax jesus
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:52:38 ok i was misinformed from before, i d e l e t e d already
i can create a new version myself jesus
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:11:39 <@!590366350065795072> can i have permission to change the stuff that is "taken" from yours
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:12:33 or rather modified
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:16:04 i mean like all i took from it was the stuff i was confused on, i could never match that quality. ive been stuck on the elevators for several days
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:18:08 yes but apparently doing a fully built from own head fuselage isnt enough to be considered original
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:20:20 and no answer
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:20:22 ill ping again
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:20:29 bruh i did build it my way
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:20:54 all i needed reference/inspiration/help on was the elevator and the cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:06 fine i may not have the build but i still have the screenshot
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:14 check again
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:14 
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:23 does that look like an exact copy?
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:24 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:21:37 i didnt even do the exact motor placements because I WOULDNT BE ABLE TO
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:02 i never copied it so like
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:10 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:15 99 understands
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:20 its not even close
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:45 and here we are
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:22:57 me being forced to delete it because apparently its not different
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:03 intention of remaking the jet
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:07 sorry can you rephrase that
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:36 i m a d e my own jet and merely took techniques/designs from alpha thinking i had permission
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:38 so therefore
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:44 why would i be remaking it
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:46 what
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:23:54 .....
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:24:05 alright let me clarify what went through my head
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:23 1. "nice, pog F4! i wanna make me own and make it as small and *try* to match quality if possible with my knowledge
1a. stumped on cockpit and elevators
2. makes 2 versions the 2nd version you all know and love
3. posts, proud of creation
4. gets accused of copying
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:24 alpha
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:27 i asked you so much
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:28 and you
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:33 didnt answer so all i did
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:34 was
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:37 check out the method
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:43 but your method was too advanced for me
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:47 so i simplified
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:50 its not even close
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:25:54 to your ability
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:26:14 even after checking yours i wouldnt be able to do the same techniques
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:26:30 look i never have intentions to copy
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:26:36 i went through three days work
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:26:40 trying to figure out the elevators
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:26:58 bruh i asked you see
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:27:14 ok then you could give me an answer
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:27:28 ive deleted anyway but i can make me version possible better
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:28:18 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:28:24 i wouldnt have been able to even if i tried
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:28:56 like one time i was asking ia how the motors were connected yet not connected and he didnt know so i improvisied
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:29:27 ohgodcrayons doesntunderstand

creations-chat 2020-10-20 19:32:44 update 10/20, 12:28 PM PST, micro-phantom v4.
finished elevators, experimented with lock tower placement/toggle. 
added placeholder cockpit, experimenting with wedges for cockpit instead of half wedge + smaller half wedge combo.

result: disconnectors fail to toggle lock tower properly, resorted to old TNT usage. used same concept i used on a different jet to make angled horizontals. 
fuselage is beginning to take shape, preliminary wings and control surfaces.

will begin working on control and performance soon after some more finishing touches on looks.

**It may look similar to alpha's again, but this is because im challenging myself to use lock more to make smaller jets. space limitations require similar techniques.**

creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:43:09 update 10/20 3:37 PM PST
performance finishes and working afterburners have been added. close to the final product. i've experimented with cockpits and this cockpit wedge/layout is the best possible for this size (dont attack me)

i barely remembered how to do the elevators, but just scrolled up a bit to check. a preliminary jolly roger paint job has been added, but this may or may not be kept. 

here is an image of it in build mode, since some people here don't understand the difference between copying directly and just similarities.

**since i am challenging myself to build in this small scale, things are hard to do without getting myself accused of copying. there are limitations at this size, and i did what i could with what i know. if you accuse me of copying, i really dont care, the build has the same scale so its hard for me to make it look as original as you want without ruining looks.**

tl;dr, i did what i could to make it original. there are limitations on how i can change stuff with this size, so stop attacking me and learn the difference between similarities and differences.

creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:39:31 i dont get why people care about the mere **opinions** of others, i mean you can get constructive criticism from those that do not think highly. on the other hand, if someone wants to just rate you badly for no reason, just let them be and don't make a big deal out of it. seriously, it couldn't matter less, let them be envious or stupid or whatever and laugh
creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:43:05 people's opinions, you can care about, thats fine, but dont care about them to the point where you go crazy to change their opinion

ive also optimized them to be easy to camera lock every time i load, it takes me about 10-15 seconds really. not that big of a problem since most of the camera lock that is planned and is present is pretty close to each other, and im pretty speed at clicking between objects.

creations-chat 2021-02-02 04:23:14 periodt
creations-chat 2021-02-02 04:32:39 criticism sometimes *sounds* like hate, but here, where ppl have super high standards, thats almost always the case. remember that ppl giving you their opinions is always an opportunity to improve, and that hate and toxicity you seem to be getting isnt always meant as hate and toxicity - its honest feedback, and naturally, no one likes "rough honesty" as i like to call it. so the next time you're getting somewhat harsh criticism, dont complain and see what you can do to improve; instead appreciate that people are spending some time to help you improve your build.

also its pretty funny
creations-chat 2021-06-07 03:01:28 agreed. he has the right to not share it, like ppl can always make a new technique thats better, but saying for someone to cook sandwiches as an insult is kind of an example of the dumb stupid

it's never gonna get better
creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:31:35 no quite the contrary

in fact, feedback is usually generally rude because elitism = look down on people below, but sometimes the criticized person just can't accept the fact that they have errors because theyre proud of it

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:10:38 so it was one of my earliest builds yeah and i never got it to fly properly like it did in the show
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:10:49 lmao basically
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:10:59 anyway i used hover thrusters way back when to
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:11:02 make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:11:03 ish
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:11:23 ive just gotten an idea to use hover drives in a core to make it lift up by itself
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:11:32 for actual flight
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:11:56 because they need to be generating lift the entire time because that boomerangs wings don't do shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 06:15:44 i need to test this lift core

general 2022-11-03 18:34:31 thats what im sayin
general 2022-11-03 18:34:54 the F-35 is the most capable jet ever to be built

general 2022-11-03 18:43:52 bitch please speed isn't as relevant in modern combat
general 2022-11-03 18:43:55 (bvr)
general 2022-11-03 18:45:03 okay and
general 2022-11-03 18:45:15 the fighter from the 60s never seeing the 5th gen in question
general 2022-11-03 18:45:25 (they have to use their eyes)
general 2022-11-03 18:45:41 speed is not the current meta
general 2022-11-03 18:45:43 !!!!
general 2022-11-03 18:46:20 how unfortunate

general 2022-11-03 18:47:50 AIM-120
general 2022-11-03 18:49:02 why would you think
general 2022-11-03 18:49:13 something based on the SR-71 would actually have dogfighting capability
general 2022-11-03 18:49:15 oh my goodness
general 2022-11-03 18:49:33 because its fast?
general 2022-11-03 18:49:40 you are like a reformer when it comes to speed
general 2022-11-03 18:49:43 DUDE
general 2022-11-03 18:50:28 okay theres no single good speed for maneuverability
general 2022-11-03 18:50:29 first off
general 2022-11-03 18:50:39 theres an optimal energy state for every plane
general 2022-11-03 18:51:10 don't.
general 2022-11-03 18:51:35 you do not have correct aeronautics knowledge
general 2022-11-03 18:51:37 you are russian
general 2022-11-03 18:51:52 you just said speed = maneuverability
general 2022-11-03 18:51:56 i have a basis homeboy
general 2022-11-03 18:52:16 information is limited is it not???
general 2022-11-03 18:52:38 you said this in a discussion regarding the A12 and F35
general 2022-11-03 18:53:05 yes and that is completely fine
general 2022-11-03 18:53:29 no
general 2022-11-03 18:53:39 it would be going too fast to turn efficiently
general 2022-11-03 18:53:55 this depends
general 2022-11-03 18:54:00 on too many variables
general 2022-11-03 18:54:05 but yes. another f35.
general 2022-11-03 18:54:22 that is just one variable
general 2022-11-03 18:54:33 theres the range of engagement
general 2022-11-03 18:54:39 theres the weaponry available
general 2022-11-03 18:54:43 etc etc etc
general 2022-11-03 18:55:15 incorrect. AIM-9X block 3
general 2022-11-03 18:55:36 basically upgrade level
general 2022-11-03 18:55:38 as in
general 2022-11-03 18:55:48 WHAT

general 2022-11-03 18:57:56 the flanker is massive
general 2022-11-03 18:58:01 yet everyone knows it pulls
general 2022-11-03 18:58:52 there you go
general 2022-11-03 18:58:57 thank you for figuring it out
general 2022-11-03 18:59:21 so?
general 2022-11-03 18:59:28 it's just new
general 2022-11-03 18:59:45 plus full capabilities would probably be hidden
general 2022-11-03 19:00:21 koay
general 2022-11-03 19:00:23 ever wonder why
general 2022-11-03 19:00:31 the harrier was developed
general 2022-11-03 19:00:34 perhaps the yak 38
general 2022-11-03 19:01:00 what can a helicopter do that a jet can't
general 2022-11-03 19:01:04 think about this question
general 2022-11-03 19:01:22 bitch please planes fly balanced and stable
general 2022-11-03 19:01:29 in terms of takeoff
general 2022-11-03 19:01:31 what can't they do
general 2022-11-03 19:02:30 basically helicopters takeoff from very small spaces with disregard with runways
general 2022-11-03 19:02:32 HOLY SHIT
general 2022-11-03 19:02:47 HELICOPTERS DON't HAVE SUPERMANEUVERABILITY WOW!!!
general 2022-11-03 19:02:49 god damn
general 2022-11-03 19:02:58 you aren't even funny homedawg
general 2022-11-03 19:03:03 you just come off as dumb
general 2022-11-03 19:04:31 the reason harrier was made was to take off from anywhere when the soviets removed NATO airbases from existence in a first strike
general 2022-11-03 19:04:43 same reason why parts of the autobahn are reinforced for aircraft landing
general 2022-11-03 19:05:44 well that's the concept
general 2022-11-03 19:05:53 any relatively flat plane-sized area becomes a landing zone
general 2022-11-03 19:06:26 cool
