Antonov 225
Blocks: 4760
Wingspan: 141
Length: 102
Width: 9
Height: 12

Featuring detachable nose, retractable ramps and retractable gears

Had to use 414 super rocket engines just to make it fly, also the back end was too heavy so I had to use helium and ballast to balance the weight between the front and back. The beast is so big that it causes a major lag which happens on and off until its properly folded.
