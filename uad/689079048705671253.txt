plane-crazy 2021-11-22 19:59:51 Wood planks on such a big ship ? The default wood planks would look awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 20:00:08 Could use signs but damn that would take too long
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 20:00:15 Its an amazing ship i think
general 2021-12-20 10:12:25 Damn
general 2021-12-20 10:12:34 The A-10 kinda sucks ngl
general 2021-12-20 10:12:55 The vulcan isn't even the fastest gun
general 2021-12-20 10:13:14 Gau-8
general 2021-12-20 10:13:34 But those are two separate facts
general 2021-12-20 10:13:58 The A-10 kinda sucks and the Vulcan isn't the fastest gun
general 2021-12-20 10:14:04 Two separate facts
general 2021-12-20 10:14:12 Exactly
general 2021-12-20 10:14:42 I'm talking about both separately
general 2021-12-20 10:15:18 It sucks conmpared to the Mig-23 GSh-6-30B
general 2021-12-20 10:15:46 A gun so powerful
general 2021-12-20 10:16:02 That it would scare targets, pilots and civilians
general 2021-12-20 10:16:35 6000rpm would shake the plane so hard that it fucking lost systems most of the time
general 2021-12-20 10:16:39 Not to mention
general 2021-12-20 10:17:26 The shrapnel from the shells could damage aircrafts in flight
general 2021-12-20 10:17:34 Meaning you could shoot yourself down
general 2021-12-20 10:17:37 Sheer power
general 2021-12-20 10:18:26 Well yea true but it was a variant of the Mig-23
general 2022-02-08 16:06:30 crazy plane 3
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 17:56:55 any idea on how one could make an effective ground attack plane? i find it so hard to line up a ground target with my plane but i can't manage to improve
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 17:58:23 yes but i'm not new to planes
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 17:58:24 at all
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 17:58:44 i do advanced and detailed motor locks already
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 17:58:57 but i have no idea how i could more accurately guide my plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 18:01:59 i used wasd, but that severely limits my ability to do small corrections
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 18:04:02 i thought about using motor 2 mouse control but i quickly gave up
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 22:05:45 No more boombox
