help 2021-02-06 11:05:25 Hello?

help 2021-02-06 11:06:00 Dude
help 2021-02-06 11:06:14 i need that belly flop and re-orient processes to be working
help 2021-02-06 11:06:35 Like I need it to be slowed down all the way while it is at the top of the sky
help 2021-02-06 11:06:39 or something like that
help 2021-02-06 11:07:35 Like...i need this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdTYMry7fq0
help 2021-02-06 11:09:07 like the thing I literally need

help 2021-02-06 11:11:01 Alright, not to stress you
help 2021-02-06 11:11:11 I only need it to fall down belly-first
help 2021-02-06 11:11:17 ***stable-ly***
help 2021-02-06 11:12:53 I used super rocket engines for Yaw
help 2021-02-06 11:12:59 Is that good
help 2021-02-06 11:14:04 Roll is different from Yaw
help 2021-02-06 11:14:21 
help 2021-02-06 11:15:51 Dude, whenever the rocket face, vertically or horizontally, yaw is yaw, pitch is pitch, roll is roll
help 2021-02-06 11:16:02 
help 2021-02-06 11:17:53 It doesn't change
help 2021-02-06 11:18:11 Spin your hand, and that is called roll
help 2021-02-06 11:18:18 move your hand sideway
help 2021-02-06 11:18:23 called yaw

help 2021-02-06 11:21:08 and Level 4?
help 2021-02-06 11:22:19 But it works like a skydiver when come down
help 2021-02-06 11:22:57 What
help 2021-02-06 11:23:30 "put the same amount of wing panels in the fron ***than** in the back", what do you mean?
help 2021-02-06 11:24:13 I see
help 2021-02-06 11:24:32 Not to stress you, I only need that fall to be stable right now
help 2021-02-06 11:28:57 It never worked
help 2021-02-06 11:29:23 It only work if I still keep the flaps (motor and wing panels) deployed
help 2021-02-06 11:30:39 it flips uncontrollable-ly
help 2021-02-06 11:30:56 without any ways to fix it other than deploying the flaps again
help 2021-02-06 11:31:49 That is exactly what I un-want
help 2021-02-06 11:32:18 i actually need a skydiver scientists right now
help 2021-02-06 11:32:27 the rocket part, I worked on it
help 2021-02-06 11:32:33 Pardon?
help 2021-02-06 11:33:57 So what is the matter?
help 2021-02-06 11:39:23 Well you say so, this won't work right?
help 2021-02-06 11:46:18 With that design?
help 2021-02-06 11:50:37 I see....
help 2021-02-06 11:50:40 and it worked
help 2021-02-06 11:50:42 perfectly
help 2021-02-06 11:50:48 the other design you showed me earlier
help 2021-02-06 11:50:52 Didn't work pretty well
help 2021-02-06 11:54:51 The thing worked so well
help 2021-02-06 11:55:05 i need to work on the belly flop now
help 2021-02-06 11:56:52 Do you have anything to perfect it
help 2021-02-06 11:56:57 I mean, could you help me?
help 2021-02-06 11:57:03 https://streamable.com/j3woh2
help 2021-02-06 11:57:27 Like I try to belly flop, the thing just flies back and that is the problem
help 2021-02-06 11:57:41 Skip to 2:26
help 2021-02-06 11:59:21 So does it work again if I turn like very fast?
help 2021-02-06 11:59:51 How to speed that up?
help 2021-02-06 12:00:24 Because the panels keep it slows down at 82 if I keep Starship horizontally fall down
help 2021-02-06 12:01:19 Like 1 or 2?
help 2021-02-06 12:05:28 How does 1 click affect the speed?
help 2021-02-06 12:05:42 Attempt 4 already https://streamable.com/ux8oc8
help 2021-02-06 12:06:17 To go up I use rocket engine (S,W, Untoggle)
help 2021-02-06 12:06:24 Go sideway none
help 2021-02-06 12:07:35 it is untoggle
help 2021-02-06 12:07:45 meaning that it is only to throttle up or down
help 2021-02-06 12:07:54 and you know it is very slow
help 2021-02-06 12:08:05 Not on or off, but throttle up and down
help 2021-02-06 12:09:11 Let me explain:
help 2021-02-06 12:09:53 1. I need it to go forward and not backward
2. It need to slow down when near ground
3. Before 2., it have to do a maneuver like a change in pitch
help 2021-02-06 12:10:22 So lets assume it is perfect 90 degree right now
help 2021-02-06 12:10:42 so i want to fastly go to -20 degree now
help 2021-02-06 12:10:51 and later throttle again at 0 degree
help 2021-02-06 12:11:01 and 0 velocity at 0 terrain height
help 2021-02-06 12:11:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiQGWWZyxgA
help 2021-02-06 12:14:10 How is the center of lift shown
help 2021-02-06 12:14:21 That wouldn't help slow down earlier
help 2021-02-06 12:14:51 OHHHHHHHHH
help 2021-02-06 12:14:53 I see
help 2021-02-06 12:15:30 How to make the center of lift clsoer to weight?
help 2021-02-06 12:15:40 (Let's call COL and COW)
help 2021-02-06 12:16:07 Clearly that wouldn't help slowdown earlier
help 2021-02-06 12:16:12 How would you add the balistics?
help 2021-02-06 12:16:23 Like why and where?
help 2021-02-06 12:17:20 I don't understand
help 2021-02-06 12:17:27 that part
help 2021-02-06 12:17:33 and not the whole thing you told me

help 2021-02-06 12:21:51 But I used some of them
help 2021-02-06 12:22:14 Like there are only 3,4,5,6,7 left free
help 2021-02-06 12:22:58 Should I experiment them like on a high stand or something?
help 2021-02-06 12:23:05 Like unpowered motors
help 2021-02-06 12:23:30 Hold up that is just stupid
help 2021-02-06 12:23:43 The thing belly flops on mid air
help 2021-02-06 12:23:52 and making a stand doesn't actually simulate the situation

help 2021-02-08 04:56:45 Like: "No no, not gonna stable, I'LL NOT GONNA STABLE"
help 2021-02-08 04:57:03 I intended to land on the spawn point platform

help 2021-02-08 06:04:11 That is not how the concept is
help 2021-02-08 06:08:12 So the problems are:
help 2021-02-08 06:08:55 1. When the thing belly flop, it goes down very fast
2. It just flip over too much
3. Engines are too slow to accelerate up
4. Can not do belly flop early
help 2021-02-08 06:35:33 Shut up that is not allowed
help 2021-02-08 07:11:11 If he doesn't respond then quit that idea
help 2021-02-08 07:11:18 or leave this server
help 2021-02-08 07:18:39 I've found a solution for Starship to tilt tool much

Is that deploy the bottom flaps foward and stop the tilting

Found this after watching attempt 6 again: https://streamable.com/68vk9e
