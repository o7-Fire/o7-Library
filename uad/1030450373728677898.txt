general 2022-11-18 11:41:10 That or the said state has a huge issue with lgbtq
general 2022-11-18 11:41:45 Because alot of lqbtq parades are just giant protests
general 2022-11-18 11:42:26 Why is it people make giant lgbtq protests in a different country
general 2022-11-18 11:42:34 Their home country isn't gonna help them
general 2022-11-18 11:42:43 The country you protested in wont give a fuck
general 2022-11-18 11:42:50 And you'll probably end up in jail
general 2022-11-18 11:44:09 So lets talk about how russia is destroying itself
general 2022-11-18 11:44:37 The birth rate in russia is not enough to cover the loses in russia
general 2022-11-18 11:44:45 They have lost 600k people
general 2022-11-18 11:44:49 And many more
general 2022-11-18 11:45:24 Like the russian military hording all of the budget meant for the military
general 2022-11-18 11:45:55 Hmmm i wonder why we are losing the war in ukraine not like i stole the entire budget out of greed and corruption -Russian official
general 2022-11-18 11:46:17 Miner spelling mistake
general 2022-11-18 11:46:44 The question is do they function properly and are not to expensive to produce
general 2022-11-18 11:47:16 China almost never had an original design
general 2022-11-18 11:47:35 From 1927-1960 they never had any original designs
general 2022-11-18 11:47:43 Its just stuff from other countries
general 2022-11-18 11:47:49 Or licensed versions
general 2022-11-18 11:48:15 That was later and after the cold war
general 2022-11-18 11:48:40 Early to mid cold war moment
general 2022-11-18 11:49:09 Sometimes they are just upgraded versions or variants to existing ones
general 2022-11-18 11:49:30 Russia and nato
general 2022-11-18 11:50:12 I understand why they did that approach in the cold wat
general 2022-11-18 11:50:29 You have no idea how expensive it gets
general 2022-11-18 11:50:43 The Abraham's project costed 3 billion
general 2022-11-18 11:52:07 Only yesterday did i realize how expensive some tank projects get
general 2022-11-18 11:52:38 Makes for a good bomb to drop on enemies
general 2022-11-18 11:54:03 When will china be original for more then 1 second
general 2022-11-18 11:54:31 All the tires used for russian armored cars are just knock off american versions from china
general 2022-11-18 11:55:58 I am happy im not part of that group

general 2022-11-18 12:17:28 That is good
general 2022-11-18 12:18:41 Why smoke coming from the wings
general 2022-11-18 12:18:52 Also why did the wings swap
general 2022-11-18 12:19:34 The way the air looks on the gap between the wings just seems off to me
general 2022-11-18 12:19:37 For some reason
general 2022-11-18 12:20:18 I do not speak Mexican
general 2022-11-18 12:20:26 I only know german and english

general 2022-11-18 12:23:16 How are you sure that's not just your own voice
general 2022-11-18 12:24:40 Im guessing you put that there because people will attack you for saying that
general 2022-11-18 12:24:59 Since people lack common sense to understand the concept of an opinion
general 2022-11-18 12:26:04 Given the fact i haven't heard of this plane until i was 12 shows how uninterested people are in modern jets
general 2022-11-18 12:26:41 He simply doesn't understand how to respect others opinions
general 2022-11-18 12:26:51 That or he holds a big grudge against europe

general 2022-11-18 12:31:37 German over engineering son we spend hours trying to fix them because of how complicated the tutorial js

general 2022-11-18 12:36:43 Lets talk about the t-34-85 then
general 2022-11-18 12:36:47 Was it good enough
general 2022-11-18 12:37:13 When the welding is so shit a pebble could deform the armor
general 2022-11-18 12:37:33 That is true

general 2022-11-18 13:06:44 The devs can add blood to their game and say its just tomato sauce
general 2022-11-18 13:06:56 Roblox wont know any better

general 2022-11-18 13:11:41 Tds has a huge lack of youtubers that aren't memers because of the lack of anything to do in the game
