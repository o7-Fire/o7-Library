bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:14:40 Would be nice if when you shot someone's wing off it actually is cut lose, not just a chunk that is invisible for you and not the enemy pilot
bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:15:13 Sometimes you get to "shoot the whole plane off" and the pilot would just zoom around in his seat
bug-reports 2019-04-11 05:15:30 As if the whole plane was there intact
bug-reports 2019-04-17 04:10:47 are you saving to the autosave slot lmao

creations-chat 2019-09-09 02:09:54 didnt mean to post it in <#384025409945337856> ðŸ‘€
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:10:49 Can we damage our own stuff with missiles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:11:03 Ik we can do it with tnt
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:16:58 Doesnt answer my question
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:19:30 So let's say I make 2 cars
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:19:41 And one shoots a missile at the other
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:19:45 Lit
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:19:57 Really lit
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:20:33 I'm gonna make a qf4 because my phantom is lonely
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:21:42 Pilotless f4 which will just circle in a server for me to shoot down bc sometimes it's hard to shoot things down with only missiles that only work at ~300 sps
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:22:07 And other people fly at like 500 or even 600
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:22:37 Those are less dangerous
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:26:26 When will mouse aim with planes be better tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:26:58 What are ac130s
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:27:18 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:27:34 Great missile targets lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:27:57 What if we did a warthunder and allowed us to shoot down missiles
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:28:21 Dont think so
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:28:49 Mouse guided missiles tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:28:55 Imagine that
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:30:39 Not very accurate tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:30:43 In my experience
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:30:59 I guess
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:31:44 But mouse aim?
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:31:48 Really?
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:32:05 Control surfaces dont work too well with mouse aim for me
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:32:24 Did that
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:32:44 Not the problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:32:49 It spun out of contorll
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:32:57 Control after a distance
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:33:07 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:34:04 Messes with planes tho if you want to launch it from those dont you think?
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:34:35 But the mouse aim will always be active
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:34:52 Meaning while it is attached it still moves the controls
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:36:00 I'll try at it but my planes are really fucking small compared to other peoples
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:36:29 https://gyazo.com/f91670ef2ec548bffb3e335f6cfc5955
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:36:38 Literally my biggest creation
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:37:57 Two 2x1 control pieces already turn this thing on a dime
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:38:10 It's an f4 phantom
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:38:33 It's really small so I need some holes to not interfere with the motors
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:38:56 That's me
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:39:27 In total ~1.5 weeks
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:39:46 Left for a while because people dislike my small planes
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:40:00 My f86 and mig 15 got lots of dislikes
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:40:35 Just got back into the game this week and built this plane today

plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:55:44 What I'm saying is that part is a bit flat
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 06:55:55 Instead of 2x1

creations-chat 2020-02-14 19:59:09 isnt there a suggestions channel
creations-chat 2020-02-16 03:13:25 its like a funky prop powered cambera
creations-chat 2020-02-16 03:13:49 
creations-chat 2020-02-16 03:13:56 woops
creations-chat 2020-02-16 03:14:11 forgot we shouldnt post pictures here
creations-chat 2020-02-16 03:14:26 eh whatever a mod will probably deal with it
creations-chat 2020-02-16 07:08:31 i dont see how its a turbo prop
creations-chat 2020-02-16 21:50:17 you know what kv stands for right? lmao
creations-chat 2020-02-16 21:50:38 usually they just give things like that a really cool name if its british
creations-chat 2020-02-18 02:39:27 ive seen this fucking tank like 6 times now
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:09:40 anyone know how to put guns into the gaps of other guns?
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:10:45 
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:10:49 i saw someone do this before
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:11:38 magnets dont clip together
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:26:14 
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:26:14 i got it
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:28:07 had to use magnets and pistons
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:28:14 but they are really wacky
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:30:23 cant go above 700 with this gun set up
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:30:27 makes my plane wobble
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:31:15 it's because of the guns
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:31:44 yes it can go higher but adding stuff makes mouse aim wobble
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:32:27 yes but im using a smaller platform
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:32:37 your build is as big as the base
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:33:35 also the plane has larger wings which dont act too nicely if paired with high speeds motor 2s
plane-crazy 2020-03-02 01:35:43 motor 2s are also what control the control surfaces on the plane and i dont see yours using motors for anything but guns
creations-chat 2020-03-02 01:55:56 mini phantom
creations-chat 2020-03-02 01:56:10 
creations-chat 2020-03-02 01:56:33 
creations-chat 2020-03-02 01:58:38 it's mouse aim
plane-crazy 2020-03-03 04:21:41 anyone else's hovers spawning in upside down or backwards?
creations-chat 2020-03-06 17:13:08 Everything I make is tiny
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:35:13 I think planes which dont have broken speedometers are good
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:35:44 Like when you make a high detail giant build but a single prop plane could outrun it at 200sps
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:36:13 When the giant build reads like 500
creations-chat 2020-03-08 19:36:20 Because of lag
creations-chat 2020-03-10 16:01:08 Never realized having more parts is a good thing
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:25:43 You can make anything fly in plane crazy if it has a single 1x1 wing panel and enough thrust
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:49:32 People compare it to their standards is all
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:49:46 No one hates you
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:50:05 They just dont like your creation
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:50:35 But if you accuse people of being douchebags
creations-chat 2020-03-12 18:50:44 Then you might as well be your creation
creations-chat 2020-03-12 23:22:49 I mean a lot of oscillating turrets are proportioned like that

general 2020-04-08 17:34:42 Yea
general 2020-04-08 17:34:48 That's what I did
general 2020-04-08 17:35:05 Lots of fucking motor compression but I did it
general 2020-04-08 17:35:41 
general 2020-04-08 17:36:17 Yea the turret is wierd
general 2020-04-08 17:37:56 So it can move
general 2020-04-08 17:38:38 Cylinders drag the collidable parts of motors on the ground
general 2020-04-08 17:39:36 Yeah...
general 2020-04-08 17:39:58 The whole point was to try and make a tiny m60
general 2020-04-08 17:40:11 But it turned into whatever that is
general 2020-04-08 17:41:20 It was originally suppose to go with the f4e I posted

creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:45:49 here is how my hover thruster planes usually fly
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:46:42 the bigger ones usually fly more sluggishly tho
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:46:57 so i guess that explains its lack of use
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:48:32 ngl the rudder is really big
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:48:47 too big
creations-chat 2020-09-27 17:49:18 everything is mouse aim except for the alerons

creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:56:31 <@!730808827234091041> a lot of people might like something like that but i think too much is going on in that engine
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:58:01 clutter
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:06:17 as cool as this thing looks i fucking hate it bc it cant do well in pvp. whole reason for building it was to replace my mig 21 :/
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:07:21 the problem is lag; it turns well, goes 1000, no wobble
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:08:43 armor isnt the problem

creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:27:26 why trap doors and disconnectors?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:39:34 shredder bugs dont exploit any glitches to do their purpose. they are legal. if anything my hover thruster jets are more illegal than any shredder bug out there lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:43:14 after realising motor locks are gonna always be slightly uneven i have used camera angling instead
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:44:15 its really restricting on where you can place it tho, im pretty sure they break the creations if its on a motor lock
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:46:48 yeah they kinda wacky, almost had to restructure my whole plane once
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:48:11 perhaps but i bet it all just depends on where your pilot seat is
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:52:01 on the a10?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:56:05 
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:00:10 that splitter is ugly
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:13:13 maybe half compress wing panels
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:14:14 it makes it have a bit more drag but there wasnt much space to go fast with a car that big anyway
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:16:39 i think thats a cool nose
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:17:47 if you want it to look more aggressive make it longer,but i think its fine as is
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:18:48 bulky
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:19:49 the nose looks more generic now imo
creations-chat 2020-10-29 16:53:24 pretty sure half the people here are redditors
creations-chat 2020-10-31 01:50:13 damn he got that cargo plane ass
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:20:00 its a mass of purple and wings
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:21:16 then make something people like
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:22:19 dont wait for people to change, change yourself (as cheesy as it sounds)
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:23:20 use downvotes as a way to see what people dislike or like not just for your creation but take a look at other downvoted things and see the relations they share so you can avoid them
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:28:19 he needs suggestions stop being a snob

<@!618132044253364325> 737 is pretty cool i guess
787-10 is also a new thing coming out i think
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:30:49 its a suggestion not an assignment, if you drop it no one is gonna care
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:32:21 because its a suggestion?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:34:19 he wanted a suggestion because he was stuck not knowing what to do (problem)
i **helped** him from this situation by giving him suggestion on what some interesting options are (help/solution)
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:37:31 in the end he found it helpful. i made a simple suggestion because he didnt need complex specifications; only that they needed to be airliners
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:38:48 ask him if it was helpful then
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:40:14 if you cant break this down when ive already done it for you im done talking
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:42:15 he couldnt decide between the options he had; it like sitting in an icecream shop but you cant decide on what flavor to choose
creations-chat 2020-11-01 03:46:11 <@!317833859603496971> read deeper
creations-chat 2020-11-02 03:38:13 waist swivel?
creations-chat 2020-11-02 18:21:05 thats a lot of unneeded motor lock
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:08:04 the transition from the triangle nose to the square cockpit looks bad
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:10:56 ive said it before but downvotes could be from how it looks, build qualities, potential, or even just if builld is from a nationality who the downvoter doesnt like
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:13:44 when is <#504436696021204992> not toxic lmao

plane-crazy 2020-11-02 20:17:25 ill need to see what powers your plane, its speed, and how big it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-02 20:17:33 as well as the wingpanel layout
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:53:55 i dont like the transition from the nose to canopy
creations-chat 2020-11-02 20:54:56 pretty amazing. might look crazy if you turn on night setting <@!322926915336011787>

creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:46:04 The maus has the hammer and sickle so that allied spies would assume its a captured soviet design not for avoiding being bombed
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:47:36 Doesn't make my point any less true

creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:06:20 Those angles are wrong wings should be like 12Â° and I forgot what the tail was but you can look them up
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:10:31 23Â° is the back <@393347954305662977>
creations-chat 2020-11-11 17:12:02 Why did you zoom in so much just to circle it lmaooooo
creations-chat 2020-11-11 22:44:55 the top nose is the reworked one. what you guys think?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 23:32:19 minecraft manifold
creations-chat 2020-11-12 07:42:31 what it reminds me of
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:20:44 dont be put down by a downvote, good to see you arent
creations-chat 2020-11-13 22:49:12 that 15 looks like a bunch of things cobbled together to resemble something of a fat and stubby 15. ifyou were to get pictures of the wing and tail individually i never would have guessed it was even a mig
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:55:28 if we angle motor lock its never gonna be 100% symetrical right?
creations-chat 2020-11-14 00:48:34 thats a mig 17 lmao
creations-chat 2020-11-14 00:50:09 the photo is a mig 15? nah thats a mig 17 for sure

creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:54:02 not everyone who likes ground likes air stuff and vise versa

and giving 1 example is p unconvincing bc it could be a coincidence
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:56:08 put it in play mode
creations-chat 2020-11-19 01:58:25 a shorter nose
actually nvm the cockpit looks weird tho
creations-chat 2020-11-28 22:19:49 <@!553754576709353494> can i see the back part of your buccaneer?

OH FUCK MB IM TRIPPING
creations-chat 2020-12-01 22:35:46 proportions on that ~~f-8~~ a-6 makes it look like a completely different plane

(missread but still applies)
creations-chat 2020-12-02 17:12:44 looks more like a kpz 70
creations-chat 2020-12-07 17:54:08 <@!621612942076542998> looks nice but that blur hurts my eyes
creations-chat 2020-12-09 01:25:10 <@456226577798135808> more weight in the fuselage lets you turn better
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:55:57 <@456226577798135808> aint a mig 9 chief
creations-chat 2020-12-09 19:08:19 too blocky imo and unfinished builds are bleh

then expect negative feed back bc most people arent v
creations-chat 2020-12-10 03:35:31 its like looking at speghetti code
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 22:23:22 camber is yuck, more than a few degrees is impractical
creations-chat 2020-12-16 21:13:27 wierd photoshop
creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:13:07 i never saw why it would matter as long as they dont post them in creations channel or claim its theirs
creations-chat 2020-12-20 19:15:36 maybe some people just wanted to have fun? you dont have to learn anything, its a game not hw
creations-chat 2020-12-25 06:26:29 <@!644377285746622494> the V is for era armor anyway, the wt t72b is a t72bv
creations-chat 2021-09-02 18:15:55 <@!490544126606049311> id love to see the frame for the canopy created instead of the glass bubble

general 2021-09-02 18:48:54 just the back?
general 2021-09-02 18:49:05 kk thx
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:26:25 i dont trust angled motor locks to be symetrical enough where is my camera lock
creations-chat 2021-09-03 02:37:54 common â‰  overrated
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:15:59 <@!401530469952389130> make the cockpit bigger and make the tail a block or 2 longer
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:04:08 Bruh i love the yf-19
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:04:28 Thats fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:04:47 I dont expect it to transform bc of how clunky building could be
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:06:41 I dont doubt you can do it but I'm happy as long as I get to see more valkyries in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:07:15 I saw a dude make a really nice vf 31 but it was only able to be in fighter mode
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:07:27 Vf31j specifically
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:08:04 Tho I can't tell the difference from most the vf31s except the vf31a which isn't a forward swept wing like the rest of them
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:08:24 Blue
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:08:41 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:09:30 I wanna try making the yf 21 or vf 22 I think
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:10:01 That looks closer to a vf 11
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:10:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:10:26 Imo the vf 29 is my least favorite
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:11:23 Unless you're talking about macross 0
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:12:16 Macross 7 was awful to try to get through
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:12:24 I liked it but I hated it at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:13:05 The macross 7 ova was really good tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:14:00 The latest game is a rhythm game lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:14:32 I could see that happening bc the toys from back then were aimed at both boys and girls
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:14:44 With the valkyrie and the action figures/dolls
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:14:54 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:15:27 Still rank sdf as #1 but I still enjoyed the rest of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:16:37 I watched both bc of the pre and post war stuff
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:17:40 Post and pre zentradi war
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:18:07 Dyrl only captures after they take off and when Hikaru blows up the zentradi guy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:18:52 Yes they did have different time lines but some of the stuff that was accepted from sdf was not shown in dyrl
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:19:45 Everyone is jetfire
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:22:58 Same as every other american/russian fighter being over built
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:23:22 Some of them yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:24:16 Hey I'm not throwing shade if you build over built planes
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:24:26 As long as you're can be better its whatevrr
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:27:03 A plane id like to see is the f8
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:27:11 Not many people make them right
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:27:15 I've seen one good one
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:27:41 And I have one myself but the nose looks exactly like another person's so I dont wanna share it
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:29:25 Why they fold the vertical stabilizers like that
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:29:27 LMAO
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:30:18 Its the same height and doesn't go beyond the wings anyway
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:31:04 I'm assuming the person handling the toy didn't know its only folded in battloid mode
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:31:42 Wings are way too big on that f15 buddy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:31:49 Tone it down a bit
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:33:25 Put on the tinfoil hat
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 17:34:34 Chill out he just needed some help
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:50:39 
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:51:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:51:14 the spine is broken until camera lock is fixed tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:52:50 its hard enough to try to make it do it naturally and not be a brick
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:53:18 it doing that was just a biproduct of trying to make something big that flies nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:54:06 cant tell if youre being ironic but just add control panels to your rudder
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:54:26 if you add more wing panels to the nose of the plane it more aggressive
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:54:54 adding more vertical wing panels to the center and the rear would make it stiffer
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:55:00 but more stable
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:56:05 perhaps but idk ive never seen your spacebote
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:57:12 https://gyazo.com/c78fd0d4a14af000682bb3ebff1c0b0c
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:59:26 most clean shot ive had
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:59:38 fire works
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 06:59:54 the faster you go the faster fire works go
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:00:11 bc it adds your velocity
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:05:46 i just make my builds really small and use normal control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:06:48 if you make anything bigger i suggest motor locking some control surfaces into the wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:07:07 that way you dont have ugly gaps and big motors sticking out and ruinning the looks
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:09:24 keyboard for roll and mouse for everything else

plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:14:33 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:14:53 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:15:36 last time i posted people got toxic so i decided to not even bother with a rank
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:17:13 i think im missing out tho bc i barelly am using angled locking
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:17:21 i dont like a-symmetry
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:18:49 turn off the particle effects so we dont need to see the super rocket particles
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:19:09 i see
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:27:32 Its a pretty popular missile design
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 07:29:26 I can probably pull it off but it'll be a hassel to make more than 1
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:47:31 yo what do we use to put text on vertical stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:47:33 signs?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:47:37 or text?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:49:10 looks pretty bland so i wanna add some insignias and what not but ive never done it before
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:49:23 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:49:42 
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:50:25 
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:50:52 yeah it took some getting use to for me as well
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:51:07 i use to hate this plane but then i watched area 88
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:52:53 man i wish there were phony wings i could use
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:53:14 i wanna replace the wings with phony wings so i can actually roll
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:53:21 and not need to manhandle this thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:54:04 why does the body rock? is it part of the suspension?
plane-crazy 2021-10-16 19:54:19 i see
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 05:17:48 that t72 is gas
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 16:03:50 Take off the other rockets and see if you're still moving
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 16:04:02 If you are then its working
creations-chat 2021-10-18 15:44:40 <@456226577798135808> single engine valkyrie lmao
creations-chat 2021-10-22 01:13:18 <@676970337770012683> at that size, the wing panels add too much drag for them to work properly
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 02:22:56 Mod?
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 02:23:36 Might consider for my next mod pack
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 02:24:09 Are inf water squares still possible?
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 02:24:18 Rip
creations-chat 2021-10-25 05:04:54 the darker blue is ment to be curvy
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:48:06 t95 is not as good as t29
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:48:15 t29 is way better
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:48:18 me
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:48:28 t95 is slow with weak side armor
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:48:48 i have the t30 its pretty good but its mostly a meme tank
plane-crazy 2021-10-25 16:49:00 t29 and t34(heavy) way better
creations-chat 2021-10-25 18:37:41 maybe if you use 1x4 corner wedges and rotate them 45 degrees
creations-chat 2021-10-25 21:08:54 can i have a different angle?
creations-chat 2021-10-27 06:56:53 <@!615476635558215680> the tail is fat
general 2021-10-28 00:33:01 its like watching middle schoolers argue in here
general 2021-10-28 00:33:26 its a statement
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 00:37:51 does it fly well?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 00:48:37 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 00:48:44 this probably
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:03:47 <@!294980570885390346> could you tell me what parts you used for the vertical stabilizers?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:04:43 oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:05:09 they looked skinny in the picture so i wasnt sure if they were really 1x1 deltas
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:07:12 if i wanted to make them skinny like this i would have used motor angling and some wing control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:09:12 ngl im really making motor locking hard on myself bc i want the build mode to be symetrical
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:09:28 so this never happens
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:11:01 i cant bc i didnt bother getting a role
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:11:02 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:11:06 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:11:13 i probably could with this thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:12:30 unfortunately the spine is broken
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:12:32 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:12:38 bc of camera locking gone

plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:14:17 old version ^
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:14:59 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:15:16 for the alerons?
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:15:36 i just motor lock some normal control surfaces inside the wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:16:11 
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:17:41 if you add a ton of weight to the back then it does wierd stuff
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:18:00 https://gyazo.com/646bca9bd2af2a2ab16f78863e3feea8
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:19:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:19:26 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:19:46 i only use motor 2 for all flying wings in the back
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:19:56 bc they make huge panel gaps
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:20:24 my rudder is motor 2 tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:22:16 having wings that extend far away from the center of the plane causes slow roll rates
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:22:33 but it can be fixed with a balance of weight closer to the middle
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:22:41 and more control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:23:06 buy me a key
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:23:28 whyd you ask then
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:23:39 <#498473314445033472>
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 01:26:15 i like my phantom more than my mig 29 tho

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 00:26:55 which nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 00:26:59 mig 29
creations-chat 2021-11-09 16:54:05 You could use half blocks
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:06:06 Elevator angle is too aggressive
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:08:07 23Â° for elevator, 12Â° for wing tips
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:12:42 He could definitely use motor 2 in that situation
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:14:48 That angle doesn't need to be motor locked as it isn't colliding with anything

Edit: nvm the tail is made differently than what I usually see
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:20:52 The tail mid section could be made into 2 pieces that are close enough to look like they are touching using motor 2s
creations-chat 2021-11-10 08:22:55 Too bad you couldn't understand it because I have 0 reason to talk to you
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:54:00 think my tail is a bit small for mt mig 29smt
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:54:02 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:54:09 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:54:15 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:56:19 Nose might be proportionately too big as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:57:51 Maybe not that nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 02:59:49 On its own it looks fine but it looks nothing like a mig 29smt when I compare it
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:00:00 So yeah its wierd for me too
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:23:01 <@!723940197456281640>
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:23:21 its pretty bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:24:36 spine is bc its smt varient
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:25:20 fair
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:29:53 everyone starts somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:30:21 im still kinda garbage compared to the top builders
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:30:28 less weight
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:32:00 you can also add more wing panels to the nose depending on if you need pitch or yaw
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:32:26 if its roll then have less wing panels at the further ends
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:33:15 my mig 29 is 600 and is super manueverable
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:34:13 speed?
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:34:26 mig goes 2200
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:34:27 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:34:33 ye ye
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:38:25 conveyer planes suck lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:38:45 never see any actually controlled properly and onyl use it for running away
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:45:33 https://streamable.com/j97kue
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:46:40 add more wing panels to the back
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:48:07 nose is for better manueverability
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 03:51:29 im rebuilding it from scratch rn

creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:49:27 Your car looks autistic

creations-chat 2021-11-19 02:53:03 <@456226577798135808> the canopy should just be blocky since everything else is blocky anyway

if the spine was round like the canopy it might have worked
general 2021-11-20 07:38:59 arent real grades the low end ones

general 2021-11-20 07:58:51 i only have watched the main timeline up to double zeta
general 2021-11-20 07:59:09 of the gundams from the shows i watched i think the origional zeta is super nice
general 2021-11-20 07:59:20 double zeta is kinda overkill
general 2021-11-20 08:00:16 gundam mkII is my favorite tho bc of the paint
general 2021-11-20 08:00:55 
general 2021-11-20 08:01:02 and its great

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 04:47:16 they curb stomped the zeta gundam lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 19:59:17 might just be the fuselage being too narrow
