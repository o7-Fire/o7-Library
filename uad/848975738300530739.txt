general 2022-08-01 20:19:44 I think we should work on atomic bomb sized gender reveals
general 2022-08-01 20:19:52 just forget all the science we're doing right now
general 2022-08-01 20:20:19 tsar sized?
general 2022-08-01 20:20:24 that's not big enough
general 2022-08-01 20:21:29 Nice try
general 2022-08-01 20:21:55 Oh I thought you meant the
general 2022-08-01 20:21:58 "what is cheese question"
general 2022-08-01 20:22:07 anyway yeah gender reveal missiles
general 2022-08-01 20:22:33 I say it needs to be atleast 5x the size of a tsar bomb
general 2022-08-01 20:23:08 It needs to be able to burn down every forest in Australia with just one missile
general 2022-08-01 20:24:25 I do sincerely hope you are making this up
general 2022-08-01 20:26:00 What are the laws on hunting wolfs with rifles?
general 2022-08-01 20:28:20 Oh come on
general 2022-08-01 20:28:34 you can only hunt wolfs in Alaska and Canada according to this website
general 2022-08-01 20:29:03 Alaska is a state
general 2022-08-01 20:29:15 No it's not
general 2022-08-01 20:29:22 Alaska is a part of the United States
general 2022-08-01 20:29:40 "Alaska, constituent state of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 49th state on January 3, 1959."
general 2022-08-01 20:31:13 No you wouldn't be able to, because you're a human
general 2022-08-01 20:32:07 Please just say that you're joking
general 2022-08-01 20:32:33 Because if you're not then you need to see a psychiatrist
general 2022-08-01 20:33:56 I don't care if it's true, but just for my sanity's sake, can you please just tell me you're joking
general 2022-08-01 20:36:25 This is really the worst time for me to be in this Discord
general 2022-08-01 20:36:35 I have never been on this Discord general chat before
general 2022-08-01 20:36:40 I was just here for announcements
general 2022-08-01 20:39:23 They're either friends or the same people
general 2022-08-01 20:40:05 There's more ways of putting people down other than guns
general 2022-08-01 20:40:20 Poison isn't a weapon
general 2022-08-01 20:40:38 I guess yeah
general 2022-08-01 20:41:27 fun
general 2022-08-01 20:44:34 **I found it**
general 2022-08-01 20:44:37 **He's advertising**
general 2022-08-01 20:47:10 You are humans who are (rather successfully, to be fair) trying to troll an entire Discord, either that or you're just mentally ill.
general 2022-08-01 20:51:23 How does THAT take an hour?
general 2022-08-01 20:55:28 both of you say something at the same time
general 2022-08-01 20:57:38 You're using
general 2022-08-01 20:57:41 the google translate voice
general 2022-08-01 20:57:47 No it's google translate
general 2022-08-01 20:57:54 google translate slows down on the second lcick
general 2022-08-01 20:58:01 just like roberts voice
general 2022-08-01 20:58:33 robert
general 2022-08-01 20:58:35 say something again
general 2022-08-01 20:59:11 to be fair, when frank speaks, roberts voice doesn't go off even if he isn't muted
general 2022-08-01 20:59:23 nice
general 2022-08-01 20:59:31 l
general 2022-08-01 20:59:33 L
general 2022-08-01 21:02:04 He's setting up his soundboard
general 2022-08-01 21:02:06 lol
general 2022-08-01 21:02:49 Yeah
general 2022-08-01 21:03:02 Yeah his voice also does sound a bit similiar if I remember correctly
general 2022-08-01 21:03:12 Maybe that's just me remembering things wrong though
general 2022-08-01 21:03:58 yes
