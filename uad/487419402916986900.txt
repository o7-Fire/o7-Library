plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:06:34 i found how to get above 25k in speed
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:06:52 i'm not using engines
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:06:56 i'm using rope
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:07:27 listen idk how this works, just that rope is broken
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:07:37 i wanted to make a pendulum thing to yeet people with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:07:49 but i took off into the stratosphere
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:08:35 at 35k u start to vibrate tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:08:48 and it turns over at 55k speed(for this test)
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:09:47 i also made a railgun but thats less important
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:10:00 nope
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:10:56 well, plane crazy goes crazy if you go up/ at a certain speed

plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:12:46 i'll tell you if i hit downwards enough
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 01:13:12 yeah, its possible i go even faster cuz my ship just implodes teh physics system

general 2021-06-18 00:21:02 why did you
general 2021-06-18 00:21:10 at least cut it in slices then grill it
general 2021-06-18 00:21:15 you can't just grill the whole block man
general 2021-06-18 00:21:31 ok, it depends
general 2021-06-18 00:21:36 what is the good part
general 2021-06-18 00:21:40 the outside or the inside
general 2021-06-18 00:21:59 well, for a better ration, use cubes
general 2021-06-18 01:03:09 me n the boie found a way to survive cutter cannons
general 2021-06-18 01:03:14 there are 2 ways
general 2021-06-18 01:03:20 1. don't get hit
general 2021-06-18 01:03:25 2. aspecific armor i won,t say here
general 2021-06-18 01:05:22 theres a block  that basiquely double your armor
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:35:42 Most tutorials are bad too
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:35:55 Like I saw so many tanks right
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:36:10 Then I killed them all with a CUBE
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:36:22 Its a cube with cutter sin front
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:36:31 How does a tank not stop that
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:37:12 But that’s not it
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 01:37:23 So many shredder tur’totisl
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 21:30:11 Question
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 21:30:32 If there’s many cutters no clipped inside one another do they do more dmg
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 21:34:25 :/
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 21:34:41 It was for a cannon anyway
