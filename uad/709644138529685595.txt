general 2021-10-22 07:07:44 Unless used in gyroscope then it is fine until you go upsidedown and lower alt then gyro gets pissed and goes boom and breaks motor lock
general 2021-10-22 07:08:08 Or at least my gyroscopes
general 2021-10-22 07:08:41 No the gyroscpoe says NOPE and somehow makes motor lock give up

general 2022-04-15 03:29:38 My huey looks wrong
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:17:06 No one said anything bad about it?
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:18:53 I would like feedback because I personally see nothing wrong
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:21:01 so three blocks is to wide for you? Its a huey it cant get any thinner
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:23:00 Also tail is proportionate and it is in fact three blocks wide  it has half block walls.
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:24:47 fair enough but three blocks is all useable space and I am trying to find better colours for it since I do agree with colors
creations-chat 2022-04-15 22:30:39 Also the huey is blocky due to simple thing, I can't motor lock that well and I would rather be able to control it than have my manuvaring stuff invisible
creations-chat 2022-05-10 05:29:56 What is wrong with helicopter?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 06:24:37 its based on old helicopters it is supposed to be plain
creations-chat 2022-05-10 06:46:41 mainly H-13
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:15:16 And what is specifically wrong with it?
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:20:04 Well kinda hard to say the shape of my own made up heli that is based on a combination of helis is bed
creations-chat 2022-05-10 07:27:58 exact parts,
-tail: truss idea from H-13, Fins are from Bell 206
-Rotor, Rotor shape and droop is from H-13
-Cockpit: Based on H-13 bubble cockpit and OH-6 Bubble cockpit
-Housing of everything behind cockpit: shaped from OH-6 and is just sealed off like the artillery protection for old spotter aircraft.

general 2022-06-18 17:01:02 But the engines are on the wing tips
general 2022-06-18 17:01:33 And it has a tail gunner
general 2022-06-18 17:01:40 With ejection seats
bot-central 2022-07-08 09:30:19 ?shelp

general 2022-07-08 09:36:57 I am from japan
general 2022-07-08 09:38:45 Try eating american sushi in one bite.
general 2022-07-08 09:39:35 You have to open wide however
general 2022-07-08 09:40:00 It's bigger than real sushi
general 2022-07-08 09:40:31 Sushi is like wine
general 2022-07-08 09:40:45 there is many types
general 2022-07-08 09:41:36 Japanese sushi is able to be eaten easily in one bite
general 2022-07-08 09:42:46 American sushi is also very different flavor
general 2022-07-08 09:43:19 Due to fact the two nations have very different heath standards
general 2022-07-08 09:44:52 They usually don't soak the rise for as long
general 2022-07-08 09:45:42 One sushi restaurant had dry enough rice the roll basically fell apart when you picked it up with chopsticks
general 2022-07-08 09:46:12 It was too dry
general 2022-07-08 09:46:21 There is a sweet spot
general 2022-07-08 09:46:31 Too wet it falls apart
general 2022-07-08 09:46:53 too dry in some spots also come apart due to it not sticking
general 2022-07-08 09:47:34 Its best to make the rice a little puffy
general 2022-07-08 09:47:42 so it sticks better
general 2022-07-08 09:50:38 I love it when movies and shows make food and narrate the way to cook it
general 2022-07-08 09:54:00 Also America is weird
general 2022-07-08 09:54:15 you guys can say friend or pal kindly
general 2022-07-08 09:54:27 or rudly
