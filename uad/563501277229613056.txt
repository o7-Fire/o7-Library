[TITLE] - Pipe Pieces
[CATEGORY] - Building

[DESCRIPTION] - Pipe pieces would include a T and L shaped piece. The L shaped piece would just be a cylinder that curves, and the T shape would be a cylinder perpendicular to a cylinder.

creations-chat 2020-12-30 00:57:29 its really glitchy though
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:04:12 but its like teleport glitchy because its motor angled on motor lock on motor angle on motor lock
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:07:05 yes its glitched because of the wedge i use to make the cockpit's bottom slant
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:10:04 no because the glitched parts are on the outside and add a lot of detail

plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:04:45 
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:05:06 guns a block apart so theyre not attached and attach them to locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:05:25 np
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:06:13 it depends on ur build but u need a spot to hide them

plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:07:54 illinois does the thing the turret mounts to rotate?
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:08:16 k so try not to interfere with the movement but basically:
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:08:52 build the gun above where you actually want it to go then motor lock it down so that it goes in place and all the motors pulling it together are hidden
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:09:11 np
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:09:18 prob be pretty hard on such a small build

plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:36:16 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:36:20 not triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:36:45 theres multipl ways heres one:
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:36:55 remove the triangle wedges and wedge blocks then replace them with a circle
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:36:59 as the nose gets smaller
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:37:05 the diameter of the circle gets smaller
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:37:55 one of my engines uses that technique
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:38:56 theres also this finger design. only that one corner uses that design
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 00:38:58 no
