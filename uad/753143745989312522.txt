general 2023-07-13 09:35:51 Help, my plane slams it's nose gear down as soon as it touches down
general 2023-07-13 09:36:25 I did that already
general 2023-07-13 09:36:27 and it doesn't work
general 2023-07-13 09:36:45 side effect is that when it stalls the plane noses up and i don't want that
general 2023-07-13 09:36:53 Thank you I'll try
general 2023-07-13 09:38:32 It still does it but slower, I'm gonna add a few more
general 2023-07-13 09:38:39 but i'ma try landing at a higher speed
general 2023-07-13 09:38:45 might be cuz i was too slow
general 2023-07-13 09:42:06 It's able to hold but for a few seconds then it slams down
general 2023-07-13 09:42:42 yeah, i just noticed that i kept that muscle memory from other plane games
general 2023-07-13 09:43:07 though the first problem wasn't because i was reducing throttle, it slammed down even if i wasn't
general 2023-07-13 09:45:33 it still slams when i didn't reduce throttle, might be the spoilers too
general 2023-07-13 09:47:01 ok so this time i wasn't using spoilers or decreasing throttle and i still slammed nose hard, i now have to use 200 speed
general 2023-07-13 09:47:03 to land
general 2023-07-13 09:47:05 that's like
general 2023-07-13 09:47:06 190 knots
general 2023-07-13 09:47:24 fuselage gears touchdown nose gear just falls
general 2023-07-13 09:47:31 Normal approach n shit
general 2023-07-13 09:47:36 as soon as the gears at the back touchdown
general 2023-07-13 09:47:39 the nose gear just gives up
general 2023-07-13 09:47:46 yeah
general 2023-07-13 09:47:47 flare
general 2023-07-13 09:48:03 no, not enough space in the plane for custom gears, it's an old build
general 2023-07-13 09:51:55 tried to land at 200 speed, can't even flare without going up
general 2023-07-13 09:51:59 i'll just accept that it slams down
general 2023-07-13 09:53:15 i mean of course, flaps can't do shit spoilers can't do shit either
general 2023-07-13 09:53:26 the only thing they do is slow down to a certain point
general 2023-07-13 09:53:39 well maybe flaps help a little bit in slow speeds since it's like
general 2023-07-13 09:53:42 probably more precise idk
general 2023-07-13 09:54:19 i HATE skibidi toilet so much
general 2023-07-13 09:54:27 because i don't want another key to work with
general 2023-07-13 09:54:30 when landing
general 2023-07-13 09:54:44 no embed perms (wonk wonk) i sent in dms
general 2023-07-13 09:55:13 i don't want another key i said
general 2023-07-13 09:55:40 the amount of keys i'll get on this plane is about to fill up my entire keyboard god damn it
general 2023-07-13 09:55:46 i have a control for every key on this bloody thing
general 2023-07-13 09:56:08 WHAT
general 2023-07-13 09:56:46 tail wings i think you mean the horizontal and vertical stabilizers
general 2023-07-13 09:56:50 i tried that
general 2023-07-13 09:56:56 i guess i didn't put enough ballasts??????
general 2023-07-13 09:57:38 my fingers won't let me use that thing without it slipping off why? my fingers hurt :(
general 2023-07-13 09:57:54 sent
general 2023-07-13 09:59:17 i put it far back because for some unknown reason it tips over
general 2023-07-13 09:59:32 i was like "why did i put the gears so far back"
general 2023-07-13 09:59:35 then i put it back to the wings
general 2023-07-13 09:59:42 and it tipped over
general 2023-07-13 10:00:15 Mouse +WASD, R, F, Q, E, P, L, uhhh i forgot
general 2023-07-13 10:00:43 then tell it to stop
general 2023-07-13 10:00:57 yes i know, but it's necessary because it looks kinda cool
general 2023-07-13 10:01:09 also the other plane games i play have that much controls so cope
general 2023-07-13 10:01:42 i see.

general 2023-07-13 10:03:16 middle scroll button on my mouse is so hard to press for some reason
general 2023-07-13 10:03:20 i tried <@720424437933146192>
general 2023-07-13 10:03:48 I did
general 2023-07-13 10:04:19 i just bought the thing like this month damn
general 2023-07-13 10:04:32 try to land
general 2023-07-13 10:04:35 actually though
general 2023-07-13 10:05:15 touchdown > reduce throttle > spoilers (i know you you're gonna tell me slower speeds mean slamming down but i tried doing that with ONLY touchdown and i still slammed down)
general 2023-07-13 10:05:52 yeah but i have no idea what the stall speed is so my landing speed is varied and i get nervous
general 2023-07-13 10:06:42 they lose control as soon as it goes below 100 approx
general 2023-07-13 10:06:51 my landing speed is usually 120 - 140
general 2023-07-13 10:07:48 tested again but throttling down a bit slower then noticed my "speed where you lose control" speed is 74
general 2023-07-13 10:10:54 i'm dont feel like doing plane crazy anymore
general 2023-07-13 10:10:57 erhheafa
general 2023-07-13 10:11:10 i'm just going to do propellor planes now
general 2023-07-13 10:11:14 nah i dont pvp
general 2023-07-13 10:11:24 only time i go to pvp is to blow myself up
general 2023-07-13 10:12:01 it's great when there isn't a sweaty tutorial jet user who keeps going up and down like a fucking dragonfly
general 2023-07-13 10:12:40 i made a build that just
general 2023-07-13 10:12:45 only gets controlled by
general 2023-07-13 10:12:46 wasd
general 2023-07-13 10:12:51 and all engines are on
general 2023-07-13 10:12:52 uhh
general 2023-07-13 10:12:53 wait
general 2023-07-13 10:12:58 On and off
general 2023-07-13 10:12:59 only mode
general 2023-07-13 10:13:03 so you just go lightspeed
general 2023-07-13 10:13:04 in seconds
general 2023-07-13 10:17:42 whats a spore i only know poverty
general 2023-07-13 10:18:24 ik about it btw
general 2023-07-13 10:18:31 nver played it though
