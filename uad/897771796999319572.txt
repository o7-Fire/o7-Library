bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:49:04 why can't hover thruster generate enough power?
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:50:16 30 (5 lanes , 6 each) is equal to 8 jet engines
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:51:14 i'm not
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:51:25 you can overlap thrusters
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:51:58 you can place another thruster inside a thruster
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:52:06 and it normally works
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:52:31 yeah
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:52:34 i motor lock them
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:52:42 5 lanes having 6 thrusters
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:52:48 which only generate 125 speed
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:53:02 it's 0 drag
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:53:04 always 0 drag
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:53:26 i place a motorlock that's alone
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:54:00 yeah
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:54:07 i know how thruster engines work
bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:54:32 huh

bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:54:47 custom angle problems

bug-reports 2023-07-06 13:55:15 maybe that's the problem
