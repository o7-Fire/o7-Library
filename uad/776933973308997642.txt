The Tale of onmarz (776933973308997642)
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 21:44:24 Does motor locking effect speed or handling in any way?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:49:26 why do some people hate on the normal landing gears?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:27:41 why are motorlocked wings important
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:27:46 what does it even do better
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:31 my planer can't fly so I put rockets on the bottom of it and it turns really fast
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:43 non-motor locked supremacy
general 2021-12-01 21:53:18 how do you get the ability to post images?
general 2021-12-01 21:53:35 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 22:54:26 how can I improve a planes handling
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 00:39:28 even more than just that?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 01:42:03 what is vectoring thrust?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 01:42:52 hover thruster?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 01:43:52 is it so I can turn the thruster from turning back to turning down so if I turn sideways I turn fast
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 01:44:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:36:51 what do ballast balast blocks do
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:37:04 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:37:28 <#627195143040139264> worthy
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:43:29 why would you want that
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:44:25 I get boat
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:44:40 but just make plane gooderer
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:44:46 weight is sus
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:45:21 if your plane weighs anything you are just bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:45:37 How I get image perms
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:46:19 how did I not see this channel
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 02:46:22 I am blind
the-dump 2021-12-02 02:51:49 you are sussy among us sussy baka among us I am not, we are not the same
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 15:29:15 someone attached custom missles to their plane but instead of exploding they have shredders on them
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 15:29:41 and there plane has loud music
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 15:34:21 the thing is
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 15:34:28 his plane looked good and has motorlocked stuff

general 2021-12-02 19:34:01 my man said no to physics
general 2021-12-02 19:34:52 This thing has no engines to creat thrust yet has problems with going up
general 2021-12-02 19:35:16 yes
general 2021-12-02 19:36:37 I out here thinking my builds are decent and then you pull out a no engine, no wing, no propeller  thing that flyes
bot-central 2021-12-02 19:37:03 !rank
bot-central 2021-12-02 19:37:08 almost there
bot-central 2021-12-02 19:37:12 just a bit longer
general 2021-12-02 19:37:57 I want to know how to build this thing
general 2021-12-02 19:38:52 ay
general 2021-12-02 19:38:56 I can post images now
general 2021-12-02 19:43:13 this is the best I can make
general 2021-12-02 19:43:44 yes I have 2 rockets facing backward using the same key as the ones facing forward
general 2021-12-02 20:01:11 I now see your finger and will use this to triangulate the position of the atoms which make your face to see what you look like and your address so I can blow you up with an icbm
general 2021-12-02 20:01:14 get rekt
general 2021-12-02 20:01:37 I said nonsense

plane-crazy 2021-12-04 04:48:49 where?
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 21:14:22 I am learning motorlocking and it isn't as hard as I thought
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:14:20 what is special about a pilot seat?
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:14:44 than why is it in the game?
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:16:25 that is main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:16:31 but just normally pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:16:44 really?
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:16:48 how did I not know this
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:17:25 I don't have friends to try it with
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:18:15 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:18:22 I know understand pilot seats
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:18:25 useless
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:24:27 nah
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:24:31 2 main pilot seats
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:24:32 wow
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:24:37 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 07:24:44 <#627195143040139264>  worthy
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 20:04:13 what is yout favorite block in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 20:04:17 mine is the small propeller
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 03:23:47 I made this last week [when I had been playing for 1 week] but never got to paint it
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 03:24:57 why you react to my message
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 03:25:01 and ping someone else
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 03:25:05 I am confsued
general 2021-12-15 13:48:27 I learned motorlocking and then quit the game

plane-crazy 2021-12-30 05:59:03 I like how I made this in my first week or 2 of playing and then never touched the game again
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 20:16:28 I am trying to make a tiny plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 01:04:49 What is the best engine
general 2022-01-05 01:05:11 What is the best engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:52:41 
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 23:52:46 wip
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:15:00 it goes over 1k speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:25:07 
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:25:11 progress update
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:26:17 I may have to change the cockpit shape to get rid of exposed motor lock and need to add vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:27:20 I may make it vtol too
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:38:41 with enough time and wanting to kill myself
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 00:38:48 I will make it take off vertically
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 01:15:20 that's what I do
creations-chat 2022-12-24 03:10:38 I had that once and I fixed it by setting the clock on my computer 1 hour back.....
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 03:27:16 I'm gonna make the intake on the bottom have a block bigger and added more motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 03:27:29 I will make this deady and vtol
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 03:28:06 I know
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 03:28:16 I already have a slightly bigger vtol plane

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 05:58:57 angle locking?
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 06:20:42 it didn't work
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:33:20 my newest wip
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:35:14 it's gonna be so cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:42:04 I 5th gen fighter
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:42:22 the finest one ever made
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:43:17 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:43:59 keep it
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:44:03 make something new now
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:47:18 don't color it
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:47:21 you are new to the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:47:28 just make and make and make to get good fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:54:46 progress update
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:55:52 I have a 16 block jet that is really good but I wanted to go something smaller so I did an 8 block long one but it suck so now im going for something in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:57:44 my goals for stats are 2k speed, 2400 stable speed (for when descending), payload of 3 guns and 2 missiles
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 16:46:15 should I give my wings on an f-15 custom angle or just use normal delta wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 23:20:21 I'm having trouble with glitched mouse not wanted to control roll
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 23:30:23 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 23:30:41 i prefer mouse
