creations-chat 2022-02-19 23:41:28 Can you motor lock Camera locks?
creations-chat 2022-02-19 23:47:04 Then how should I make swept wings on my MIG-25? Delta wings suck at their job and I'm not really that good at multiple motor locks

the-dump 2022-04-22 01:37:42 I didn't intend for you to chuckle
the-dump 2022-04-22 01:37:54 I was announcing that the cringe was stop
the-dump 2022-04-22 01:38:48 have a nice day
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:17:34 I got a meme
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:17:42 But I don't have image perms yet
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:18:03 TBH it's kinda boring
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:18:11 but you need to accept the fact
bot-central 2022-05-05 20:19:38 !rank
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:19:51 Yeah alright
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:20:41 He would say: "Like a liberal seeing an offensive meme"
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:21:00 He breaks down into bits
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:21:24 Yeah that
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:22:46 Okay so yeah I don't know how to make memes
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:23:56 Yeah I meant to say SJW or something like that. Regular lefts or rights are okay. However, the ones you hear are the loud ones, and the loud ones always are the crazy ones
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:24:38 Because radical ideas mean radical headlines

the-dump 2022-05-05 20:29:36 Ever heard of brontoscorpio?
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:29:51 It's a giant prehistoric scorpion
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:30:16 Basically a coconut crab sized scorpion
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:30:53 Oh and then there is pterygotus
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:31:14 There are a lot of giant prehistoric scorpions

the-dump 2022-05-05 20:31:45 Yeah
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:32:22 Yeah gigantism was becoming a bit of a meta, and it was such a simple and blunt playstyle
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:33:17 Imo, it's not humans themselves that make them cool, but what they can make
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:33:34 Like look at a M1 Abrams or starfighter jet
the-dump 2022-05-05 20:34:58 I mean, once the forgotten worlds update, a long ways away, comes out, we should be around #27 on the intelligence tier, considering AI, AI aiding, and other species

creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:42:11 How's my Drone?
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:44:17 It's body is once block wide, I suck at painting, and it's one of my first builds to have complicated motor locking. I have like, two or three more before it
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:46:04 I did. So are you suggesting that I do smaller changes it color, like by only a few numbers to give it variable but not contrast?
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:47:58 Alright, I'll try that next time
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:52:03 Why?
creations-chat 2022-05-31 16:30:22 I'm confused
