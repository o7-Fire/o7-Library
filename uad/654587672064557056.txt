plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:44:02 guys is there any mechanism to fire out something lethal at incredibly high distances at considerable speed?
i know it is very specific but thats what it is supposed to be
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:45:34 yeah but whatever you shoot will have little to no precision, so its not long ranged
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:46:16 flowet?
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:47:01 oh
then use motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:47:21 that'll do, thanks
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 16:56:43 hm yes
flinger 2.0
general 2022-02-16 14:50:13 Guys help
shredder bugs are becoming smart
one added a hover engine to his shredder
what do i do
general 2022-02-16 14:50:57 a what on where
general 2022-02-16 14:51:48 oh yeah, my jet has that, but i suck on jet + hard to aim smh
general 2022-03-07 16:08:20 why tho lol
general 2022-03-07 16:11:55 yeah constant updates should do, but creating a whole new map, new mechanics, a lot of new blocks, and other stuff cant just fit in an update like that and no context whasoever
general 2022-03-07 16:29:21 what does pcc stand for, never heard of it
help 2022-03-08 19:35:14 I'm making a build and when I load it the binds of stuff won't save, anything I can do about it?
general 2022-03-09 14:24:06 uhhh, anyone here has weird problems with saving stuff aswell? my binds dont save
general 2022-03-09 14:24:33 it has been going like that since update came out
general 2022-03-09 14:24:39 tested today and still
general 2022-03-09 14:25:01 breh
bug-reports 2022-03-09 14:27:27 my friends and bunch of other people i know have issues with saving stuff, when saving and loading some builds, the binds don't save and everything loads unbinded 

Specifically cameras and ballast tanks
bug-reports 2022-03-09 14:39:55 aw hell naw
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:05:53 life has the meaning one gives it to, you decide what to do with it, goals, ambitions, ect, are just the part that gives it its turns, but in reality you are the only one who can change stuff
if you are depressed is beacuse something is making you so, so get rid of it, or make it so it wont be a problem no more
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:08:53 thats the trash part trashy ppl get, and tehy get it because tehy want to, if you dont want to be in the trash can then do stuff with effort and love, you will reach any goal you are willing to
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:09:58 and?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:11:07 and? theres a dude here thinking in suiciding don't you think a *normal person* would try to help no matter the context or circumstances?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:11:33 i know, i have been reading all along
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 19:25:39 anyone knows why motor 2's dont work on water? or is it just a game bug
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 19:26:38 sad
help 2022-04-09 15:17:03 i made this huge bomb (about 700 total blocks) and have no idea how to make it moove by the air, planes and v-tools dont work, and hovers simply unstabilize, any ideas?
help 2022-04-09 15:18:12 theres still space inside for wings tho
help 2022-04-09 15:21:06 how do i move it into that location then?
help 2022-04-09 15:22:44 ok that solves one problem but how about if i want it to move it by the air? like if i used it as a dropping bomb?
help 2022-04-09 15:42:47 crystal themed spaceship/starship, clearly it needs to have floating parts just hanging in there
help 2022-04-09 15:44:18 u aint gonna make it urself? like, is the pic to build from it or as reference?
help 2022-04-09 15:44:45 ok gimme a sec
help 2022-04-09 15:46:19 here are bunch of concepts i inspired from to make a crystal v-tool
help 2022-04-09 15:46:30 should be useful to you
help 2022-04-09 15:46:47 np
help 2022-04-09 15:55:43 cameras have collision, thats why he is using text
help 2022-04-09 15:56:34 because he probably will use those cyclinders to move
help 2022-04-09 15:56:48 and if he doesnt then use cams
help 2022-04-09 15:57:22 ok nvm then
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:02:12 how in the world
help 2022-06-05 18:06:07 any idea on how to make it faster while it is still mouse controlled? current speed is 350-600 (full size image cuz idk maybe you can do something with it)
adding more hovers just unstabilizes it and makes it unable to move correctly
help 2022-06-08 15:28:08 is the game supposed to crash after some time of setting pistons to both lock an powered?
no more after 3-7 minutes of using powered and locked pistons my game crashes, any solution? (yes i need the pistons with those settings)
help 2022-06-08 15:31:15 im on pc
help 2022-06-08 15:31:56 would setting the graphics to lowest help?
help 2022-06-08 15:32:08 ok, thanks for the help
help 2022-06-08 15:33:09 aigh, thanks for the help
help 2022-06-08 15:45:41 if you are using a conveyor engine, its probably the lack of space, if not its a motors bug
help 2022-06-08 15:47:03 you dont even use motors? then i dont have any idea of what it is
help 2022-06-08 15:48:18 also how can you get that fast with only rockets?
maybe its the speed after all, try making it a bit slower, and if that doesnt work then idk what will
help 2022-06-08 15:50:30 then idk man, i dont really see what could do that
help 2022-06-08 15:52:10 try removing the motors you used for steering
help 2022-06-08 15:52:21 its the last thing i could think of
help 2022-06-08 15:54:46 ok i give up, good luck with it
help 2022-06-08 15:54:53 i have no idea on what to do next
help 2022-06-16 17:01:48 how can i fix down tilt at 0 gravity (Ballast doesnt work)
help 2022-06-16 17:05:36 im using hyperdrive (conveyor engine variant) to go that fast
help 2022-06-16 17:06:03 you eman like, put it right on the center?
help 2022-06-16 17:06:06 mean*
help 2022-06-16 17:11:12 aigh, ill try that
help 2022-06-16 17:28:28 still the same
help 2022-06-16 17:47:07 wdym
help 2022-06-16 18:15:33 used both ballast and helium, ballast at the back simply doesnt work and a sinlge helium block at front makes it tilt up
help 2022-06-16 18:17:39 already told you, helium at 0 gravity overrides weight so it tilts where helium at no matter amount
help 2023-01-14 16:09:12 So, when i load a build with signs on it, the text is simply gone, any knowledge on this?
help 2023-01-14 16:09:31 yes
help 2023-01-14 16:10:28 well this glitch doesnt seem to affect other people and has been going on for months to me
help 2023-01-14 16:11:54 my build literally has only 6 signs, 5 signs 1x1 and one with 1x3
help 2023-01-14 16:12:04 and there isnt much text either
help 2023-01-22 09:54:49 Anyone has any idea how to make cutter cannons more accurate?
I made a shotgun but only works goodly at point blank, which isnt very fun knowing its stationary :/
help 2023-01-22 11:38:13 tried already, the cutters just breake and clip trough teh barrel anyway
help 2023-01-22 11:38:44 i can get an image but its just the classic 3x3 magnet cannon
help 2023-01-22 11:44:36 
help 2023-01-22 11:44:50 if you need the contraption too just tell
help 2023-01-22 11:45:50 also the blocks inside that are not glass are magnets that launch the cutters
help 2023-01-22 12:16:29 it has enough reach for all of the cutters, also theres a door on the front so they dont get instantly blown up as soon as the build is loaded
help 2023-01-22 12:16:54 it launches all of them near-evenly?
help 2023-01-22 12:18:08 so if i put a magnet facing foreward all along the barrel, you tell me they'll have a different effect?
help 2023-01-22 12:18:45 wouldnt that make it more inaccurate?
help 2023-01-22 12:19:42 aigh ill try that, but does it have to be up until the very end of the barrel?
help 2023-01-22 12:26:33 ok i see, but theres a small detail that i overlooked, nearly all of the blocks on the cannon are 0.9x1 blocks, so all i can really do is extend the barrel with magnets
help 2023-01-22 12:26:57 or the cutters stick to it
help 2023-01-22 12:29:03 is what im doing
help 2023-01-22 12:29:10 but it might not be as effective
help 2023-01-22 12:31:38 i make myself an idea
help 2023-01-22 12:32:19 a guide is not a tutorial btw
help 2023-01-22 12:32:44 unless its a literal guide on how to build X specific thing
help 2023-01-22 12:34:21 oh yeah that one
help 2023-01-22 12:34:34 yeah i dont think so
help 2023-01-22 12:36:01 also the magnets should have superstrenght or nah?
help 2023-01-22 12:36:20 okok good
help 2023-01-22 12:41:00 ok should the sequence be full on magnets or magnets spearated by blocks?
help 2023-01-22 12:43:46 is bc the game lags because of how fast they go
help 2023-01-22 12:45:38 im aware, yes
help 2023-01-22 14:04:16 Ok, so about this:
good news: managed to make cutters go very fast without causing lag
bad news: the accuracy remains unchanged
help 2023-01-22 14:09:22 it already has a long barrel
help 2023-01-22 14:09:30 i doubled the size of this
help 2023-01-22 14:21:34 you mean like, pushing inside?
help 2023-01-22 14:23:40 yeah already done that
help 2023-01-22 14:23:59 that adds speed but not much accuracy :/
help 2023-01-22 14:24:50 also what does "weld" do on a magnet?
help 2023-01-22 14:34:14 wdym? like moving the jet as a whole without turning it?
help 2023-01-22 14:35:19 probably hovers or gravity slider
help 2023-01-22 14:36:46 ok then i have no idea what you mean
help 2023-01-22 14:48:34 any good 3x3 choke designs for a shotgun? mines are not very effective
help 2023-01-22 14:52:18 forget the top message chokes literally dont work
general 2023-02-04 18:01:46 does anyone know who is responsable for the servers crashing? like is it a game or sum
general 2023-02-04 18:02:26 oh right i should have guessed, ill be back one sec
