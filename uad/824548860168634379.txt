general 2022-07-20 16:02:30 i already checked, it says nothing about it
general 2022-07-20 16:02:54 ..

general 2022-07-20 16:05:04 i scrolled up, what now
general 2022-07-20 16:06:11 all I see is vtol stuff and 'areonautical engineer'.
general 2022-07-20 16:06:48 I should be asking you that, there is nothing on here.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:47:46 the floating motors are for folding, if it weren't for them, the build would collapse.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:49:54 honestly, I probably won't change anything, I wanted it to basically look like this.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:51:58 I didn't make it specifically for destroying shredders, I made it for kind of like acting, if you know what I mean.
I am making tons of these vehicles for acting.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:54:01 For example, I am working on the Anti-Shredder Panther and anti-shredder Stegodyphus.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:56:50 yeah, well, after the release of the rest of my ships, I may or may not rebuild it in a different form.
help 2022-09-04 18:47:57 I keep trying to fix this error in this piece of motorlock but it continues to go into this block when I want it to face the corner and go into this corner (the dark grey along with the light grey)
help 2022-09-04 18:48:27 Does anybody know why this might be happening?
help 2022-09-04 18:50:17 this is the motor lock mechanism
help 2022-09-04 18:53:44 can someone tell me what is the problem with this
help 2022-09-04 18:55:35 instead of the curved piece going into the dark and light grey corner, it goes into the white block
help 2022-09-04 18:56:22 it is as if the curved piece just doesn't want to go inside the corner
help 2022-09-04 18:57:17 wdym?
help 2022-09-04 18:58:01 so you want me to rebuild the motorlock a bit to the side? alr
help 2022-09-04 19:01:29 it won't work since the curve will stick to the grey part
help 2022-09-04 19:01:51 and I will not be able to use motorlock
help 2022-09-04 19:04:32 I can try somehow just using plain curves without turning them at all but it would looks wrong with all the pieces sticking out
help 2022-09-04 19:05:07 but that would be wrong, and I refuse to do that
help 2022-09-04 19:05:24 motorlock
help 2022-09-04 19:06:40 make a hole in there,  form a motorlock piece with text at the end of it
help 2022-09-04 19:07:21 then idk
help 2022-09-05 10:54:06 can a motor lock expert please explain what is wrong here?
help 2022-09-05 10:58:51 I put all the motors on max torque but nothing changed
help 2022-09-05 11:02:23 so what should I do?
help 2022-09-05 11:03:16 Now?
help 2022-09-05 11:04:31 I  am trying to remake the loxodon but a bit different.
help 2022-09-05 11:05:01 wait, I'll give you a closer look at the mechanism,
help 2022-09-05 11:05:18 also would anchor blocks cause a problem?
help 2022-09-05 11:05:40 yes
help 2022-09-05 11:05:43 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:05:57 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:07:01 
help 2022-09-05 11:08:39 So what is happening is, instead of the like curved dark grey part going into the light and dark grey corner, it goes into the white block
help 2022-09-05 11:08:50 and it needs to go inside of the corner
help 2022-09-05 11:09:09 it's as if it is being pushed out
help 2022-09-05 11:10:11 it needs to go into there
help 2022-09-05 11:10:26 and I need to angle lock it
help 2022-09-05 11:10:45 ok
help 2022-09-05 11:10:55 what will that do?
help 2022-09-05 11:11:21 ah, ok
help 2022-09-05 11:11:57 It worked, thank you

creations-chat 2023-06-25 20:18:06 but what should I add to the next like segment of the build, this thing is gonna be  really long, im thinking about adding a cannon area with turrets sticking out of the ship on both sides but don't know how to start building it, and make it look smooth, the top part is gonna look really weird if I just leave it flat on the back
creations-chat 2023-06-25 20:31:56 I think I can use a lot parts, rotate them with motors and motor lock them together to make the round thing but it'll take a lot of time
