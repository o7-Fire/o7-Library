The Tale of interurbes (593882288954146836)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 01:54:42 The tail on the brooklyn bum is white IRL, kind of looks odd tho in PC
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:00:33 its annoying as hell when youre just dogfighting with friends and some moron in a shredder ruins it
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:15 I would honestly be willing to have cutters removed from the game to get rid of shredders
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:44 yes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:05:45 I attempted a F111 but I couldnt fit gear
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:06:02 
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:08:47 Yeah, I have never done a swing wing
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:09:25 Swoop woop bendy wing
bug-reports 2020-10-15 19:15:29 PVP mode is completely ruined when people freeze mid air for no reason
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:43:17 Kind of an odd question but I'm just wondering why hover engines aren't allowed  when applying to aeronautical engineer. Just wondering if anyone knows
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:45:36 I use the basic hover thruster and motor on all of my planes to not destroy my ears and so I can add custom, realistic sounds
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:47:35 I like sounds tho, just not rockets when there should be a prop or jet
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:49:18 Yeah I guess, I just wish there were silent engines so I'm not just spending robox on custom sounds for nothing
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:51:52 L o n g  engine
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:53:17 In games you know that you're not killing tho. It's not as fun for most people to just fly without purpose.
creations-chat 2020-10-21 19:54:52 As long as the player has an appreciation for the sacrifices made IRL, I'm sure that it would be fine
creations-chat 2020-10-22 19:27:22 Oh whoops meant to upvote lol
Problem solved

creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:22:34 Got 5 downvotes on this, any advice for improvements?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:23:35 Noted, thx
creations-chat 2020-10-24 22:07:56 First thick wing attempt, any advice?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 03:12:37 Might just be me but it looks like people are being a lot more picky today with downvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:08:28 Anyone know why guns have a yellow "bullet" and a red one that travel at different speeds?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:48:15 Glitch how?
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:49:31 I didn't downvote, but I'm assuming it's the visible propellers and rough areas
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:50:32 Try using motor lock to hide the rougher parts
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:52:03 Just look it up on YouTube, very useful
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:53:05 If motor lock was removed, they better make a block that functions like a motor lock. It's taken my stuff to the next level
creations-chat 2020-11-01 19:57:11 Only people that hate it are too dumb to use it
creations-chat 2020-11-01 20:00:08 Motor lock makes landing gear so much easier, along with pretty much everything
creations-chat 2020-11-03 03:41:39 Simp
creations-chat 2020-11-03 03:49:29 That's exactly the case with my p-39, people think it's a P-51 and call it wrong

creations-chat 2020-11-04 05:25:46 It's kind of nice yet funny to see people keep posting through the chaos

creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:17:58 Bruh how did the way oversized IL2 with visible motor lock all over get so many upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:21:08 I was just scrolling through after work lol
creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:22:43 Also, the guy that downvoted my B-26 for being "too blocky looking" upvoted his IL2, *hmm*
creations-chat 2020-11-17 02:27:45 I just thought of an idea, what if there was a channel deticated to videos of people unfolding builds. I personally really enjoy watching that type of stuff
creations-chat 2020-11-18 16:07:54 Am I having a stroke?
creations-chat 2020-11-20 02:52:24 Wing and a prayer
creations-chat 2020-11-20 02:55:28 eh true
creations-chat 2020-11-20 02:59:24 At least I got the gear down before contact
creations-chat 2020-11-20 04:22:40 <@717151103606849567> more area behind the wing, higher up elevators, tanks on wing tips, and if you can, more angling on the snoot
creations-chat 2020-11-20 04:24:41 Actually, needs a longer nose too
creations-chat 2020-11-20 17:46:31 Sides of the turret don't look good imo
help 2020-11-21 19:59:36 Does anyone know why the sign censor is so broken?
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:44:25 Prawn suit self upvote
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:04:55 For the horten, get rid of those control surfaces, thicken the wings if you're making a large aircraft, make the landing gear custom and stick out less, and better overall proportions and wing shaping
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:07:34 Np, it's a good start for getting into complex building of aircraft. No matter how experienced anyone gets, there's always a way to improve.
creations-chat 2020-12-25 18:10:55 Definitely need to lengthen the wings and round out the rear. Probably extend the back to a point too.
creations-chat 2020-12-29 23:18:05 Any feedback for my A4E before I put it in creations?
creations-chat 2020-12-29 23:27:10 very noice

creations-chat 2021-01-21 16:55:56 Spam downvote moment
creations-chat 2021-01-21 16:59:44 Bruh, just because your interests dont exactly match everyone else's doesn't give you spam downvote permission
help 2021-01-24 03:18:47 Yeah, it ruined a lot of my builds
help 2021-01-24 04:11:03 My landing gear on 4 of my planes only moves in one direction now

creations-chat 2021-01-25 06:01:43 The body isint bad tho, the main wings are the main issue

Jesus christ these people don't even let you edit with this awful 2 minute wait time

creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:06:34 Hows that work? bruh this slowmode tho | What can you use it for in builds?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 04:10:38 I don't know what's happening in creations but I like it lol
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:19:41 What goes around comes around, lol
creations-chat 2021-02-12 16:27:15 Not gonna lie though, only a couple of the pictures that pyro has put on creations actually deserve downvotes, the rest are good
creations-chat 2021-02-19 16:10:14 Smooth the nose, make the wings bigger and more angled, angle the tail more, smooth out the tail, smooth the body, and make something to fill the door hole

creations-chat 2021-02-20 03:03:18 It's pretty good but I'd recommend some more smoothing on the body
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:14:37 It's the size of a B-17
creations-chat 2021-02-26 18:18:19 I'm fine with oversized but something that oversized is just way too much imo
creations-chat 2021-04-08 13:53:36 That boat be looking like a minecraft build
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:44:22 How do I get it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:44:27 Didn't even know lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:44:50 Is there a block requirement though
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:45:26 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:46:45 F
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:46:55 How many?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:47:06 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:47:54 Most I've got is 74 for my yellow submarine : /
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:22:01 <@!516385356006817792> any feedback on the flares?
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:24:33 Thanks!, they were actually pretty easy. All I did was put a trail, wing light, and wing on a motor lock with wings and when I break the lock, the flare goes flying off
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:29:29 Heres the design, I dont mind if anyone copies. The motors are locked and are binded to the same key as the disconnecters at max torque and speed
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:34:46 They work completely concealed in the body, Id reccomend no farther than 1 block into the body though since they struggle to break through
creations-chat 2021-04-16 01:41:41 eh true, I might try to fit more

creations-chat 2021-05-08 15:09:54 There's not really anything I can do with painting, almost every model has a paint scheme like this
creations-chat 2021-05-08 15:13:20 I guess I'll just try to add the ribbing on the body and wings
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:55:48 <@708064765770989568> How'd you get the ball explosives to stay in place on your scatter bomb?
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:57:57 Bruh
help 2021-05-14 16:04:37 Is there a way to get ball explosives to attach to anything

creations-chat 2021-08-21 17:26:19 Anyone know how to make a better 1x1 star for the big USAF thing on the rear intake
creations-chat 2021-08-21 17:35:25 I'll try it, I already had to motorlock a disconnecter sideways to make that one
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:27:38 <@642151786966286348> any feedback for the A4?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:29:39 Ah ye u right, thanks
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:32:20 I should probably try to get thick wings too
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:40:52 Ah yeah give me a minute
I think the thin wings need to be fixed, they make the pics look bad
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:45:06 <@705816374462906389>
creations-chat 2021-08-22 17:47:17 I used text instead of cameras where I can
creations-chat 2021-08-22 18:03:30 Angling the intakes, nose, and intake decals took up too much space for the basic stack I was using for the body
creations-chat 2021-08-22 18:11:46 Also I made it a year ago and upgrading it got messy
creations-chat 2021-08-22 18:18:43 Man, the downvote gods are quite unforgiving today
creations-chat 2021-08-22 18:29:35 Plus no one is really on since it's a sunday
creations-chat 2021-08-22 18:31:36 Thank
creations-chat 2021-08-22 19:11:52 Just gonna delete my A4 post and repaint +work on it because I am coward who no like down arrow
creations-chat 2021-08-22 19:14:39 Yeah, gonna motor bend the cockpit, thicken the wings, and paint it like this
creations-chat 2021-08-23 04:47:01 this cockpit ok?

creations-chat 2021-08-29 07:51:26 thx
creations-chat 2021-09-01 19:51:49 Does anyone have drop tanks I can get inspiration from? Trying to do one for my A4 but don't know what design I should do
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:40:16 any feedback before I throw this into the hellscape of <#384025409945337856>
Whats wrong with the front?
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:42:58 this is how the prototype is besides the USAF logo
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:45:04 A4 skyhawk of VA-94, vietnam war
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:47:57 nose looks fine to me, idk how I could do the intake without a 2.5x2.5 rocket, jet, and cylinder tho, I tried to do it with a 1x1 but that was just wrong
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:50:17 how could I do them smaller?
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:52:57 the intakes flush with the top behind the cockpit tho
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:55:36 I mean its pretty nit picky, theres like .2 blocks from being accurate in most areas
creations-chat 2021-09-03 04:58:22 Im just gonna leave it, Im not gonna get better intakes without angle locking and adding 500 more blocks to this thing trying to get them to be .5 of a block smaller
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:03:15 man, might be just me but these standards are brutal lately. this guys build looks great, deserving of 0 downvotes imo
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:06:24 ikr, spent an entire week and 7 hours fixing criticism and still dont feel comfortable posting, might wait a month or just not post it to avoid these absurd standards
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:09:20 Ikr, its all a bunch of hypocritical kids too, this guy downvoted the J35 with 200 upvotes
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:11:55 Might just post my plane and ping all the hypocrite kids with their own builds and ask them to do a better job than I did lol

Dryreborn, yeah lol, probably just spreading the toxicity that was given to him too
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:14:17 Oh yeah, I bet when I wake up tomorrow some guy will have pinged me with something like "cry about it" lol
Edit: oh look there he is lol
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:16:21 I upvote that statement lol
creations-chat 2021-09-03 05:21:57 yeah, Im just gonna refrain from posting in creations and only ask for advice here, this place is nit-picking hell lol
creations-chat 2021-09-03 07:04:53 A4, not F4
Oh crap wait, thought you were talking about my plane lol
creations-chat 2021-09-03 16:49:23 <@456226577798135808> anything I could fix?
creations-chat 2021-09-03 16:58:38 I guess the front part of the wing is .5 of a block too wide, but I have no idea what you mean about the hook being copied
creations-chat 2021-09-03 17:00:55 I used signs to have disabled collisions and unexposed motors, and have one camera 5 blocks above the fuselage to hold the motor to the hook
creations-chat 2021-09-03 17:06:18 Fine, I guess I could probably angle lock a wing pannel to fix that
creations-chat 2021-09-03 17:15:23 Using motors to move things to angles before motor locking your build, like I did to angle the intakes
creations-chat 2021-09-03 17:19:13 Bruh, I just noticed that one of my motors is exposed
creations-chat 2021-09-03 17:32:43 Oh lol didn't realize you had made one, just saw you were a community guy and checked out your yt channel. I guess we do have pretty similar hooks.
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:39:10 Thinking about making. Saw this under restoration at a museum, can someone identify it?
creations-chat 2021-09-10 17:41:25 Looks like it, thx
creations-chat 2021-09-14 17:23:33 trying to make an XF85, any ways to smooth out the front?
creations-chat 2021-09-14 17:26:23 thanks, it is already painful lol
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:33:45 Looks like that wall e had 0 motorlock and it's pretty messy in some spots now that I look at it
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:35:46 That gap in the wing really throws the build off
Edit: ye, shouldn't be too hard
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:42:27 True. I've learned upvotes depend on the day and time so they're really not a good measurement of the quality of builds. I got 105 on this and I'm happy knowing that I made a decent build, regardless of votes
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:44:27 Lol, I don't really play often especially with college now. I make maybe 1 build every 3 months
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:51:08 Is there a block limit for designer ranks? I have a few high upvote things but all are under 3k blocks
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:53:11 I've never requested designer ranks lol, probably should
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 14:39:09 Sorry its not an easy fix at all, its just really oversized

creations-chat 2022-02-20 03:06:58 The 3 things that stick out to me about the warrior tank: the barrel looks quite bad, something about the camo is off, and the wheels look pretty ugly
creations-chat 2022-02-20 03:10:59 I would reccomend making those wheels and barrel look better, but a better camo could go a long way

Those colors are far too vibrant, needs more brown tones
