general 2022-04-13 21:39:47 At least your not toxic about it ðŸ™‚
general 2022-04-13 21:41:13 Why?
general 2022-04-13 21:42:51 I am simply observing the way you people choose to interact with each other so I can decide who Is more worth talking to.
general 2022-04-13 21:43:36 indeed
general 2022-04-13 21:43:48 Better to be smart than stupid.
general 2022-04-13 21:46:15 If it helps I don't talk the same in real life.
general 2022-04-13 21:49:55 Indeed
general 2022-04-13 21:54:45 Quick question.
general 2022-04-13 21:55:06 How do I insert a photo into chat?
general 2022-04-13 21:55:16 I am not familiar with the layout.
general 2022-04-13 21:56:01 My knowledge is greater XD
general 2022-04-13 21:56:30 Simple without knowledge we wouldnt have been able to make cars.

general 2022-04-13 21:58:21 Also congrats on your study in quantum physics.
general 2022-04-13 21:58:35 Indeed
general 2022-04-13 21:59:41 The jet is using compressed air.
general 2022-04-13 22:00:20 Almost the same thing they use for vtol.
general 2022-04-13 22:01:29 Explanation?
general 2022-04-13 22:03:17 How do you think, jets use air to support the power input to the engine,  meaning they could easily use compressed air if they wanted to.
general 2022-04-13 22:03:36 Why do you think they stale at higher altitudes.
general 2022-04-13 22:04:18 If you go to high in the atmosphere the air gets thin and it causes the plane to stale.
general 2022-04-13 22:05:18 Correct me if I'm wrong.
general 2022-04-13 22:06:29 Feel the power of human advancement you to could do the same
general 2022-04-13 22:06:50 ðŸ™‚
general 2022-04-13 22:07:11 Have fun.
general 2022-04-13 22:07:43 No, I have many logical senses that help interpret such things.
general 2022-04-13 22:07:55 And a more active subconscious.
general 2022-04-13 22:08:27 You misread
general 2022-04-13 22:08:45 I can not explain these senses I do not think when I use them.
general 2022-04-13 22:09:09 No
general 2022-04-13 22:10:02 In a simple manner, I can learn things from the knowledge I already have such as physical science and calculus
general 2022-04-13 22:10:20 No
general 2022-04-13 22:11:27 People don't learn things without being taught, I  think more subconsciously than most people.
general 2022-04-13 22:12:00 Ofcourse I do
general 2022-04-13 22:12:29 No
general 2022-04-13 22:12:37 Not with my own voice
general 2022-04-13 22:14:06 People are foolish, one of the main reason I am smart is because of physical activity.
general 2022-04-13 22:14:23 DO you know what subconscious thinking is?
general 2022-04-13 22:14:42 Exactly
general 2022-04-13 22:15:25 I do, I use conscious thinking to give my subconscious information.
general 2022-04-13 22:16:47 My brain is a part of me as long as I don`t lose it I will be fine, but in many cases you are right, I should strengthen my conscious
general 2022-04-13 22:17:14 Hi
general 2022-04-13 22:17:16 Welcome
general 2022-04-13 22:17:22 Make yourself at home.
general 2022-04-13 22:17:45 I am generally confused.
general 2022-04-13 22:18:50 I will not explain it to you all I will say is that I have a stronger subconscious than conscious.
general 2022-04-13 22:19:01 Hello.
general 2022-04-13 22:20:08 I am a fully conscious being both my subconscious and conscious are still stable and intact my brain only goes into autopilot when I lack sleep.
general 2022-04-13 22:20:40 I know
general 2022-04-13 22:23:09 Ight

general 2022-05-15 01:48:48 Titanic
general 2022-05-15 01:49:47 RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg
general 2022-05-15 01:51:58 It is logical for any object going at a certain given velocity, fixing to collide with something that is equal to 2/4 of its entire mass or more, is most likely going to be crushed apon impact.
general 2022-05-15 01:53:42 And there where most likely be very few survivors, look it up if you do not know, so you can tell us more about it and save us the time of looking it up our selves.
general 2022-05-15 01:54:01 Sorry
general 2022-05-15 01:54:14 I was too informative again it is a bad habit.
general 2022-05-15 01:54:24 I think?
general 2022-05-15 01:54:34 Is it?

general 2022-05-16 22:57:58 How concerning.
general 2022-05-16 22:58:32 Sad that Im not surprised.
general 2022-05-16 22:59:29 Actually, why did you do the things you did to get warned in the first place?
general 2022-05-16 23:00:09 You would be surprised how many would say they do not know.
general 2022-05-16 23:03:02 I bet that the lag machine doesn't harm your actual character, and that it would be better to turn down graphics or just leave,  for 20.00 fake Us dollars .
general 2022-05-16 23:04:11 Should of sent a video.
general 2022-05-16 23:05:24 You should of sent a video I can't observe the physics of your build without a video.

general 2022-05-16 23:07:09 Why are you using springs in the front of the helicopter instead of near the propeller?
general 2022-05-16 23:08:13 Why do you have springs in the front what is the purpose of the springs?-_-
general 2022-05-16 23:09:04 What are the springs there for?
general 2022-05-16 23:09:49 Everyone
general 2022-05-16 23:10:02 You do it all the time even when your unaware.
general 2022-05-16 23:10:47 What do you mean?
general 2022-05-16 23:10:58 It is logical and accurate, right?
general 2022-05-16 23:11:05 Does it matter?
general 2022-05-16 23:16:14 People don't learn things without being taught, I think more subconsciously. it is merely learning using the information you are taught by observing it allowing you to learn more.[Intuition]
general 2022-05-16 23:19:05 Depends when did they start?ðŸ˜‰
