general 2021-10-06 17:27:54 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 10:44:26 Can someone help me?

What does "*locked motors are fixed in newer servers, roblox messed up once again and has now resolved the issue*" mean ? <#490306593242611742> 
Did they remove the motor lock?

bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:05:19 Hi!
I didn't find my problem in <#498473314445033472> so I ask for help

**• Video •**

The motors are **vibrating **when a motor is link to another motor linked to a** too heavy a load**
    -> Simple motor has no problem moving the heavy load

*Is there a solution to resolve it?*
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:17:44 Normal motor do the same
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:52:42 Yes
It's vibrating, but less
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:57:03 ▬▬

• Normal motors •
I'm not pressing any touch, It's moving on its own
bug-reports 2022-06-28 07:59:44 ▬▬

One motor isn't lagging, no matter the weight
bug-reports 2022-06-28 09:06:31 Torque Max
bug-reports 2022-06-28 09:06:37 OK, I'll try
bug-reports 2022-06-28 09:19:07 I'll try, too
bug-reports 2022-06-28 09:19:09 Thank you
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:51:26 Not working
I want/need to use **motor 2**
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:51:33 Not working
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:51:53 In 0 gravity, the motor is still lagging
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:52:13 > I think that the problem is that a motor is link to another motor...
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:54:49 And?
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:55:31 Well what is the solution then?
bug-reports 2022-06-28 10:57:05 ok, sad
Thanks
bug-reports 2022-06-28 18:26:56 That was a good idea, It's working for my wheels, but with to many blocks, it doesn't work
bug-reports 2022-06-28 18:28:31 But it's not working for the build I want, lemme show you, wait

plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:02 Good idea
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:47 Personally, I lag a lot (I go from 60 to 10 fps) when a big build goes in the water
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:00 And not anchored*
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:16:28 Yeah but when you want to build ship and want to RP, you can't move due to 10fps
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:17:31 Carrier, container ship..
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:59:35 Damn
