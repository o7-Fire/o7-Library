plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:53:17 Question;
Does anyone know what the speed in plane crazy **actually** represents?
my friends and I just assumed it was knots, but I wanted to know if anyone thought it could be mph or kph.
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:53:49 perfect
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:54:06 speed.. per second?
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:54:11 ooh
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:54:15 got it
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:54:22 thats all i needed to know thanks lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:54:39 1 block: 1 meter no?
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:55:19 wait so
1 stud = 1 block?
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:56:52 lmao i think they meant meters per second
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:57:22 YOU CANT TRANSLATE A **SPEED** into a **LENGTH**
meters per **WHAT**
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:57:42 ^
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:58:11 look just tell me what the conversion is from the in game speed to knots are and ill be good
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 01:58:34 1 plane crazy speed equals.. how many knots?

creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:30:10 same reason 90s cars are better than new cars
because more simple more better
the-dump 2021-04-07 04:31:27 
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:32:44 personal opinion ig
imo theyâ€™re easier to work on and the simple interiors force you to focus on driving and not mess with modern features

also a good majority of 90s Japanese cars are still running at over 300k miles with just simple maintence, which says something in regards to reliability
the-dump 2021-04-07 04:34:50 i deleted it lol, i sent it in the wrong server
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:37:48 imagine they just remove the shredder all together and replace it with a new wedge in the same shape
creations-chat 2021-04-07 04:45:06 i specifically said 90s cars because more of them are reliable than any 80s car could be, a lot of them have decently nice interiors, and they still have modern esk safety features and simple additions like cruise control. but just IMO i prefer 90s cars to modern car

i would take a 97â€™ camry over a modern car any day
(not including modern enthusiast cars lol, just your basic sedan or coupe)

creations-chat 2021-04-07 16:43:41 
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:42:15 like
dihedral?
yeah they should, thanks for the suggestion
ill do that
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:50:40 i have taken your suggestion seriously, and failed in the process due to the thick wings
creations-chat 2021-04-07 17:52:42 i assume the problem is the motor 2 which would move the wings upward. its not a solid block, so the game tries to collid the now movable wings with the immovable half blocks.
help 2021-04-07 17:54:23 <@!551806781609869313> how would that help
help 2021-04-07 17:54:58 im using motor 2 to add dihedral
help 2021-04-07 17:56:59 but the motor locking is instant, how can i get it to move before it collids with the other half of the wing?
help 2021-04-07 17:57:32 on top of that, the way the top half of the wing is build i doubt i could add a similar angle-
help 2021-04-07 17:57:33 oooooooh
help 2021-04-07 18:01:32 can you send a ss of how you would use disconnectors in that situation? they just stick to other motors and break the locking tower

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 03:58:13 a furry is someone whoâ€™s into humanoid anthro people.
beastality is disgusting and is illegal, as it should be.

the furry fandom is essentially just that, a fandom. they cosplay as characters they create themselves(and draw those characters doin some weird shit, granted). But still, very different.
One is disgusting and awful, the other is just a fandom with weird kinks.

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:22:58 kinda.
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:23:03 its extremely small
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:24:12 one thing ive noticed about this server;
the people who are **actually** good are keen to help you improve and suggest details that need fixing. people that suck (you) just laugh at mediocre builds and dont provide any input whatsoever.
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:25:35 the only think i can see thats really wrong with it for the size is that its a bit short, and the rudders should be spaced one block farther out.
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:25:38 
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:26:18 for the size id say i did a half decent job
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:26:25 its absolutely tiny
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:26:46 it fits within the gray triangle at base

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:25:23 around the glass. borders.
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:25:45 similar to A pillars on a car?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:26:19 this is beyond my level lmao ima leave you magicians to it
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:27:03 well what are those lines that border the glass? are they Trails?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:29:19 and you somehow position them.. with CAMERAS?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:30:22 i can only imagine how much motor locking you had to do to get that 1x4 wing in there, but ALSO those trails?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:30:25 this is insane
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 07:30:34 yeah
help 2021-04-10 17:21:16 does anyone know if theres a block that will only attach on two ends, nothing else will attach?
help 2021-04-10 17:21:24 like a half-slab in the middle of a block
help 2021-04-10 17:23:16 nope. im using it as an alternative to a cylinder or wing in a motor lock, and it cant attach to anything on the sides of the tower
help 2021-04-10 17:23:55 
help 2021-04-10 17:24:04 
help 2021-04-10 17:24:27 the thing is, i need to put a jet there. but it wont go down since it attaches to the cylinder
help 2021-04-10 17:24:45 and i cant make the tower higher up as ive already built half a plane up there
help 2021-04-10 17:25:14 maybe i could just put a firework launcher in the front, it looks similar
help 2021-04-10 17:28:15 
help 2021-04-10 17:28:20 
help 2021-04-10 17:28:27 i think it would look better without anyways
help 2021-04-10 17:31:55 gotcha, ill keep them
help 2021-04-10 17:32:40 yea i figured out the issue. i was just putting the jet in the wrong spot, the cylinders werent the problem
help 2021-04-10 17:32:46 thanks lol
help 2021-04-10 17:41:18 i managed to actually fit jets using some magic with wedges
help 2021-04-10 17:42:16 okay i might put that back
help 2021-04-10 17:43:15 its just that the fireworks dont move- i could color the jets the same as the fireworks to make them darker. im trying to aim for an element of realism
the-dump 2021-04-10 17:47:33 
help 2021-04-10 17:51:39 i might do something like this
help 2021-04-10 17:51:41 
help 2021-04-10 18:02:27 not really gonna be able to do something like that due to the size and rest of the plane
help 2021-04-10 18:02:40 
help 2021-04-10 18:03:01 yeah.
help 2021-04-10 18:03:03 its small.
help 2021-04-10 18:03:21 yep, im making a miniature A4 skyhawk

help 2021-04-10 18:03:48 
help 2021-04-10 18:05:01 its very wonky. i used motorlocking to move the seat up by half a block so i could see in first person and get the shape correct
help 2021-04-10 18:05:04 
help 2021-04-10 18:05:18 theres not much room to work with
help 2021-04-10 18:05:26 yep
help 2021-04-10 18:05:34 and it still looks decent
help 2021-04-10 18:06:16 and i dont want to make the jets go out any farther than they already are, because then it would be inaccurate
help 2021-04-10 18:10:06 i wanted it to be small enough to land on those tiny carriers people make in public servers
help 2021-04-10 18:10:12 also a small target in pvp
help 2021-04-10 19:52:50 I dunno. Without them it looks worse.
help 2021-04-10 19:53:24 I know how the plane is
help 2021-04-10 19:53:45 I just tried both meathods, the one without the front of the jets looks considerably worse
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:10:53 Lockheed Martin A-4. Looking for some feedback/suggestions before I post it in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-04-10 22:16:57 Thanks for the feedback I guess.
help 2021-04-11 15:04:48 I don't know if this is just me, but the radios don't work in public servers for my whatsoever. I built my plane in a Private Server, and the audio works just fine. But the second I go into a public server they just don't. I've tried re-inputting the codes, nothing happens.
help 2021-04-11 15:37:11 Yes, the music is on.
help 2021-04-11 15:37:35 It blips a bit when I spawn it, then it just doesn't work.
help 2021-04-11 16:24:35 I've seen people use a combination of wheels. I've also seen converyors.
creations-chat 2021-04-11 22:48:49 i never thought about doing this thing with the blueprints. this is beyond smart
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 22:49:57 If you still can I will.
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:02:13 i can tell. every minute detail is painted, the shading is immaculate, and there are no issues whatsoever.
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:05:48 Woah wth
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:26 motorlocking is like a drug. i need it to survive. i dont know how i did just 4 days ago when i figured out how to motor lock. im addicted.
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:32 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:37 
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:00:12 Pro?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:36:51 I've been playing the game for the past two years. I've made some pretty decent stuff. I feel so stupid for not discovering motorlocking sooner, but I'm glad I did. This F-15 is gonna be pushed to my absolute limit. I will make it fly insane, I will make it look insane, and I will make it amazing at PVP.
This plane is gonna be my two-year test. It has to be perfect, my dignity relies on it.
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:37:11 
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:37:38 It's been 40 minutes and all I've done is extended the cockpit by two blocks lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:40:51 All my other builds are at most mediocre. I'm pretty sure it's because I never spend time on them. Even my BF 109 (which was my first motorlock plane) looks nice, but has a lot of issues.
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:41:11 Like it's nice, but not good enough.
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:41:17 ^^^
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:41:54 Oh hey I saw that in game, that was cool AF
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:42:40 Nope, you joined Savage's private server by accident no?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:42:48 Yeah lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:43:19 I upvoted that. I think it looks nice.
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:52:50 What do you guys prefer? (Motor hidden ofc in the locked version)

plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:54:22 I might also make the wings locked with halfblocks to make them thicker
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:13:58 instead of doing thin wings, i'm merging them with halfblocks.

creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:23:48 Thanks for the *actual* feedback. I'll try my best to fix the plane.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:26:35 It seems to me more like you guys complaining that I'm lazy because I have a different play-style than you. Would you rather me make a shredder? Seriously, who cares if the guns can move or not. I prefer it like that. The whole point of this game is to create what you want to create, not necessarily just a constant stream of exact replicas.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 23:30:11 Then do what Heisenberg did in regards to the body. Give me feedback and I'll try to improve the plane in those regards. But wining about how I'm using guns that aim instead of moving the whole plane (which accomplishes the same affect, seriously, who cares.) just makes you seem like an idiot.
help 2021-04-13 01:35:15 <@!333570869114830859> Let's say I wanted to make a jet fighter. Where should I start to make sure the proportions are correct?

creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:55:50 you can.. hide.. control surfaces?
theres no need to make your wings look like a cheese grater
creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:58:52 you can hide them with motor locking and thicker wings. you get the same maneuverability
OR you can make custom control surfaces that move large sections of the wing like a real plane. they almost ALWAYS look better, and you 100% of the time get better maneuverability.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 17:01:38 have you not heard of motor 2 lmfao
and if you're even decent at the game you can make wings look whole without them looking like a cheese grater, and it doesnt affect it that much.

also, never heard of gjsolo lol who tf is that
creations-chat 2021-06-12 20:45:54 Does anyone happen to have examples of a cargo ship engine room? I don't have much space at all, but I'd like to include one at least, even if its really small.
