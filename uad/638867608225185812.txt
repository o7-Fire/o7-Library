general 2021-07-27 20:21:32 also i aint under aged, i just eat crayons my guy
general 2021-07-27 20:21:48 yus.
general 2021-07-27 20:22:03 wrong.
general 2021-07-27 20:22:32 just a name that ive had because yes, i like the thunderbirds, and it was a available name.
general 2021-07-27 20:22:41 You fucking hypocrite shut up.
general 2021-07-27 20:23:35 debatable.
general 2021-07-27 20:24:03 too bad its only test drive 🙃
general 2021-07-27 20:24:57 dyno actually ded?
general 2021-07-27 20:25:23 😮
general 2021-07-27 20:25:31 fuck?
general 2021-07-27 20:25:45 im confused.
general 2021-07-27 20:26:10 if you dont stop im gonna make a tri plane bf 109 next.
general 2021-07-27 20:26:24 ive already done it to the spitfire.
general 2021-07-27 20:26:56 i didnt even think of it looking like that but ok.
general 2021-07-27 20:27:03 i guess some of us here are special.
general 2021-07-27 20:27:13 okay give me some time.
general 2021-07-27 20:50:16 im lazy so its tempting to just put a german bf109 livery on a tri plane spitfire.
general 2021-07-27 20:50:37 but instead im still sitting here building a ugly bf-109
general 2021-07-27 20:56:15 doing this instead.
general 2021-07-27 20:56:35 a lil pointy
general 2021-07-27 20:56:54 looks alot like a SR 71 intake cone.
creations-chat 2021-08-10 11:03:47 whats your opinions on this?
creations-chat 2021-08-10 11:16:03 no clue, just threw together some stuff.
creations-chat 2021-08-11 12:44:55 small ass vtol
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:46:41 I agree, thats like, so illegal...
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:49:24 also, dont worry i was bein sarcastic but yes, this is kinda true ngl, you cool.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:51:27 i agree with this, mainly the last part.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:56:48 also, its a fucking roblox game, he remade something he found inspiration from, and guess what, most likely improved it to work better, as he made it on his own, theres no fucking guide from lockheed martin on how to make a F-15 in a fucking roblox game, so its not really recoloring a cartoon character, or stealing a fucking design, all he did was recreate something he liked into a fucking lego game, dont think you can copyright a hunk of metal in real life, therefore i dont see a reason why he cant make it anyways.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:58:53 whats happening? Yes.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:01:08 Because yes, that is why i say yes, because yes.

Very nice, just waiting for this god damn timer to go down, can we not have a anti spam kinda thing here? its painful.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:04:17 i mean, im just confused at the fact the dude/man/woman/thing/them person who said that hasnt brought up tutorials.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:09:24 ive been saying the f word in this chat several times, what word did i type thats more offensive than s and f words.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:12:42 dont think so, but im just confused how or why you're calling a giant ball more creative than a fighter jet that takes a good few hours or days to make, in which you have to make your own camo for it.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:14:50 dont even know what a STRV is but it looks very kewl
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:17:25 Thats what he said... (Sus Texting Edition) Also, crab good fighter jets arent the most common thing, by good, i mean the ones that look and seem like the real thing.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:21:09 german paint scheme or nah?(<- also im refering to the german hind's Paintscheme) either way looks badass already.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:31:23 man you just ignored everything you damn idiot, HE DIDNT MAKE IT FOR FUCKING COMBAT, HE MADE IT BECAUSE HE FUCKING LIKES IT, WHAT PART OF THAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, HE DIDNT MAKE IT GOOD FOR PVP, HE PUT EFFORT INTO IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PUSH HIS LIMITS AND SEE WHAT HE COULD DO, YOU DUMB?

Also, you arent a shitty person, you're just a dumbass, the end.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:34:20 indeed, i'd be saying alot more shit than just that, also whoever just said to suck there balls, i dont see none, bitch.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:36:28 well, what are you comparing his builds too then? fucking nothing? chickenfucker, bwak bwak bwak
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:39:37 well Havent seen before a billion times, yeah makes fucking sense, so your just comparing it to something you dont know about and havent seen? nice one.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:41:54 what do you consider unoriginal and tryhardy? your ball most likely wasnt made for fun, i mean its litterally just for a gun, his can fly around, do stunts, and he can have fun with it, what can you do with a ball gun? just fight, your saying he makes shit for combat and only that, look in the mirror bucko...
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:48:43 looks nice.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:24:19 he was saying that a dude who made a F-15 and a Draken was a tryhard, and that his ball turret/gyro turret was more creative and better, and kept saying the dude built his crap to only be good at combat n stuff like that.

also dude below this message, same here, and also that F-15 with the camo is the dude who crab was arguing with and saying was a tryhard, pretty sure
creations-chat 2021-09-25 01:40:01 same here,i grew a tumor because im dumb enough to have participated in it.
creations-chat 2021-09-25 01:44:38 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-05 02:02:31 : )
creations-chat 2021-10-05 02:04:34 who else here loves torturing spitfires? i know i do! ( totally didnt do the funny in <#384025409945337856> )
creations-chat 2021-10-05 02:07:44 wanna see the other spitfire?
creations-chat 2021-10-05 17:04:56 i mad something sort of normal this time instead of a tortured spitfire with 4x the amount of wings it normally has on it.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 17:07:24 instead i made a AT 802 crop duster meant to replicate this beast, and yes theres actual lethal cropdusters irl, ngl they are pretty damn cool.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 17:10:39 might make it have 2 lava spitters on the wings facing backwards for fun.
creations-chat 2021-10-13 08:54:37 <@456226577798135808> nice job on the bomber
creations-chat 2021-10-17 03:24:29 could i technically post my bf109 tutorial that i modified a good bit in creations or would it be considered low effort.

And also, can it have a german Balkenkreuz on it, or is that a big no no?
creations-chat 2021-10-17 03:26:35 seems reasonable i guess, just wondering what can get you warned, ill have to read the rules some more.


(Thanks btw for saything that)

Also modifications are some extra motor locking, some details, a repaint, a new cross design on the wings, redesign on the prop and some other stuff. but statement below is kinda true.
