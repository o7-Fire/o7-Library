creations-chat 2020-10-11 05:51:33 if you could pull it off, sure
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:03:02 very impressive
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:07:15 you see, he zoomed out slightly
creations-chat 2020-10-11 06:08:48 this is why you dont sail drunk
creations-chat 2020-10-20 00:47:56 bismarck rough shape wip, it's already 5k parts so I do not have good hopes for lag prevention https://gyazo.com/624c40962475037f547cddb017c97f72
creations-chat 2020-10-20 01:11:07 I could probably make it work by folding in the floor to fit in the upper structures but that's so much work just for a extendo ship so ill prob remodel
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:52:47 motor without annoying tip piece that welds to everything when ðŸ˜©
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:59:34 1k+ part build I'd doubt people would replicate it from 1 or 2 images
creations-chat 2020-10-20 03:43:22 can we get a zoom in on that carrier LOD massacred it
creations-chat 2020-10-20 03:45:33 lets go mini fishing boat, you have one block to make it
creations-chat 2020-10-31 08:42:00 that bow design looks leet
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:25:08 and at the end it's towing another seemless truck, but the last truck is actually made out of cake.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:26:46 always has been
creations-chat 2020-11-01 04:39:10 I do not get the rage of motor locks except for those chad heli mains
creations-chat 2020-11-01 04:40:46 poggers ac tho
the-dump 2020-11-04 18:45:53 im doin it
the-dump 2020-11-04 18:46:47 it really keeps going
the-dump 2020-11-04 18:47:01 ok I think it loops ðŸ¤”

the-dump 2020-11-04 18:47:31 its over
the-dump 2020-11-04 18:47:47 its the same one just looks glitched
the-dump 2020-11-04 18:48:50 tried to quote it rip
help 2021-01-12 01:06:29 could be your suspension being cursed by the roblox physics engine gods
help 2021-01-12 01:06:55 you dont use motor wheels youre using the base ones
help 2021-01-12 01:06:59 do you use suspension or sum
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:10:34 ah yes the all directional motor

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:11:47 why would you?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:12:27 are the plane crazy missile designs copyrighted
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:32:19 it's so he can model out his plane and better flesh it out using a more advanced tool like blender
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:32:20 (I assume)
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 04:47:35 ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 21:43:48 engineer gaming
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:28:34 it's a g l i d e r ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:28:35 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:29:40 but then again
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:29:48 motor 2's in water can fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:29:50 so if you believe...
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:30:28 why
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:30:42 I mean but what pushes it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:30:48 the power of the unholy?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:31:02 but how does it change directions
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:31:09 wait so like
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:31:41 can we get one of those aperature gifs where it shows the interior of a turret but it's just the motor2's massive internal megaplex that allows it to fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 05:17:26 fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:21:40 is there a suggestions discussions channel
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:21:58 well I suppose i will do it here
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:22:01 and cope
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:22:45 but I sadly don't think this would be possible with terrain water
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:23:27 because constantly updating the water to count what's inside would be incredibly laggy and probably sloppy and have a ton of watter cubes poking in
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:23:53 maybe if they do a fancy water and somehow replicate the water physics
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:23:59 but that would be too hard to spend so much resource on
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:24:03 when you could say, add more building blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 06:32:23 sussy
the-dump 2021-09-03 08:37:52 From an Atheists perspective, the ðŸªœ , from a Christians perspective, the former.

the-dump 2021-09-03 08:43:54 idk man
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 05:59:51 For me it's 11:59 pm
