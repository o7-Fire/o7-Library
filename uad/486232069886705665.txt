creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:09:03 There is no feedback to give, they need to start from scratch and actually look at an image of an F-8
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:14:41 I did a few days ago on his F-16 but everyone in the chat at that moment agreed it was shit (after he did the improvements)
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:16:42 yeah but atleast try to make it something similar to the actual thing not like some random jet and calling it an F-16 or F-8
creations-chat 2022-08-15 02:21:32 That's why I deleted that, I acknowledge my mistakes on my APC and started from scratch

creations-chat 2022-08-21 19:59:07 <@438388553442131988> pretty sure the F/A-18 Hornet can't operate from the Italian Cavour aircraft carrier since that is a VTOL/Helicopter carrier and doesn't even have arresting wires
creations-chat 2022-08-21 20:01:13 I mean the F/A-18 could takeoff from a ski jump since Boeing tested it but it can't land then unless there are arresting wires on the carrier

2 rockets (1 on each side) 

Bomb bay:
2 torpedoes
4 sea mines
plane-crazy 2022-09-16 19:32:09 It's a small loadout because the S-3B is small and the torpedos are quite big
contest-chat 2022-09-16 19:33:34 I would submit my S-3B but the contest rules say that you need to make new aircraft 😭😭
creations-chat 2022-09-16 20:20:44 yeah, they should hide the exposed motorlock, the build might get some upvotes then
contest-chat 2022-09-16 20:21:23 what could I build
contest-chat 2022-09-16 20:23:35 yeah Ik
contest-chat 2022-09-16 20:24:47 during the end of its service the S-3B was used as a light attack aircraft to support troops on the ground
contest-chat 2022-09-16 20:25:56 But its mainrole was ASW which is basically attacking submarines and stuff
contest-chat 2022-09-16 20:26:31 so it **technically** is an attack aircraft

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:00:51 Something's not right, since then my carrier would have to be 25 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:01:08 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:01:23 commit die <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:01:42 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:02:04 Is roscale like 1:1 scale but in roblox
general 2022-12-17 18:04:06 Bf-109, idk
general 2022-12-17 18:05:05 G1 maybe?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:05:20 70 meters wide, 280 long
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:05:38 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:05:54 brb
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:19:53 What the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:20:12 so it's gonna be like 32752 long
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:21:31 I think I will just stick to making it 1.5 plot wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:21:40 But 5 plot long
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:24:14 Hms queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:25:03 i think that's a great idea🗿
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:25:14 500 blocks is around how much plots?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:27:38 So around 10 plots wide wtf
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:28:10 If I wanted to make it player scale would 1.5 plots wide be good
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:28:36 and 5 plots lomg
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:33:53 no way
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:34:24 my carrier is 3 plots long rn but It will be 5 so I will be flexing on you soon
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:35:30 then I would make an even larger one to compete with your larger ship <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:43:33 I have a phone, can run 1 account; tablet, can run 1 account; and my pc which can probably run more than 2 acc
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:54:43 Ik
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:55:06 Nice F-16C 👍
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:55:39 Guys I have figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:55:51 40m = 1 plot
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:56:43 40×0.7×2=56
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:56:50 Plot is around 56 wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:57:17 I'm want roscale so I'm using precise
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:57:30 0 because you got no ball
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:57:55 Half wedges <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 18:58:14 Your balls are a fictional thing <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:00:31 if my calculations are correct my carrier should be 7 plots long and 1.25 plots wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:01:44 Length:
280÷0.7=400
400÷56≈7
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:01:52 here is my working out
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:04:07 I think I would need some alts
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 19:04:16 no
general 2022-12-18 09:52:38 tanks do, they are called trophies:

Trophy is a military active protection system designed to protect vehicles from anti-tank guided missiles, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank rockets, and high-explosive anti-tank rounds. A small number of explosively formed projectiles destroy incoming threats before they hit the vehicle.

bot-central 2022-12-24 18:30:56 &suggest Add a feature so that someone in the pilot seat has limited access to your build. This could be helpful in twin seat fighter jets or attack helicopters (Pilot in Front, Weapon Systems Operator in the back)

Standard gauge track: 1,435 mm = 1.435 metres

1.435 ÷ 0.7= 2.05 blocks
