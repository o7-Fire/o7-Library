general 2022-04-05 03:22:44 looks like paper
general 2022-04-05 09:35:13 since i'm making an iron man mark 33 suit for a replica of my character in-game i might as well add retractable vibranium blades since it's a part of the actual suit
general 2022-04-05 09:36:35 though they should not be given the ability to access the whitelister's save slots since that would ruin his entire careeer especially if there are huge/detailed builds in there
general 2022-04-05 09:38:25 ye ik
general 2022-04-05 09:38:32 but they still shouldn't be given that ability
general 2022-04-05 09:39:18 the fact that you just said welt blocks before you edited that reminded me of smallpox blankets

general 2022-04-05 09:41:43 dyno in another server said that all bots should be moving to slash commands
general 2022-04-05 09:41:51 but how is mee6 not affected
general 2022-04-05 09:43:15 nothing.

general 2022-06-26 10:32:44 i wish they increased the limit of signs from 200 to 1,000 or something
general 2022-06-27 11:14:22 is anyone able to help me with my mini jet? there's a problem with my canopy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 07:00:53 i ejected from my fighter jet and it somehow went into the hole in where you get the lava and water gun things
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:28:53 i made an ejectable canopy :D
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:29:03 because yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:56:33 can i see it launched
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:56:41 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 09:56:43 found it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:00 anyone have some ideas of which jet i can build?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:10 or ww2 plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:14 or misc
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:27 c130?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:59 this?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:47:24 ngl but im kinda bad at making plane and gunship noses
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:07:50 anyone have any ideas on what jet i should build next? i'm thinking of the mitsubishi f-2 since it only has 1 afterburner which is easy to do
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:23:16 What are you trying to make?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:55:40 i wonder what happens if you set the speed and torque of a motor to "nan"
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:56:05 anyone have some build ideas? i just learned anglelocking recently
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:56:54 just thought of a sci fi jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:10:01 https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-aircraft-viper-042fd4406f8d46a1a4b342e2882d8249
apparently this anglelock design works so i might be able to imitate the engine design on this jet since they're rotated
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:12:12 alr thx for the feedback
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:13:04 yea just recently
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:13:14 i got addicted to making jets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:13:22 until i realized motorlock exists
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:14:28 i made an ejectable canopy design
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:15:41 have u made one? just asking
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:15:52 oki
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:56:16 is anyone getting that sign glitch where you can quite literally edit surfaceguis
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 14:56:51 i just started playing again
plane-crazy 2023-01-31 14:17:50 i have a ridiculously overworked war game
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:17:13 https://streamable.com/afu5cp
im trying to make a hover jet that goes quantum speed but it just keeps falling at the back
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:17:23 im following a tutorial for the hovering stuff
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:18:15 tried it and it still keeps falling
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:18:49 there is no weight or ballasts there
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:21:58 i put 2 of them at the center
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:22:03 ill try more
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 13:40:18 already fixed it
plane-crazy 2023-02-12 14:52:23 dance dance revolution
general 2023-02-12 15:51:17 i genuinely forgot you existed
general 2023-02-12 15:52:01 modest's old friend
general 2023-02-12 15:52:09 until he did something
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 06:04:25 kinda offtopic but do any of you guys know of any spaceship charging up audio ids that i can use for one of my builds
plane-crazy 2023-02-14 06:06:06 and are still usable
general 2023-02-15 14:13:26 yep
