plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:15:16 wait so i still don't understand
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:15:43 why is plane crazy 2 a thing instead of just updating the og
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:16:08 is it so if players want to play the old version they still can?
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:16:46 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:17:04 a  hardcode version and a softcode version
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:18:28 yeah theres a chance your engine sounds might be replaced with a huhwahwah sound
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 22:18:45 lol
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:40:59 why do i keep getting kicked
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:41:11 due to unexpected client behavior
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:44:00 no
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:44:11 its just a big build
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:44:23 /but im confused why im getting kicked instead of crashing
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:46:34 i mean it makes sense why it might crash
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:46:39 cuz of this
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:46:42 but
bug-reports 2021-09-25 23:46:48 it kicks me

bug-reports 2021-09-26 00:07:20 i also have alarms which use motors
bug-reports 2021-09-26 00:07:23 to spin
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 01:27:23 doesnt plane crazy 2 exist just because they wanted to have a hardcoded and softcoded version?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 01:27:47 instead of just changing the original to softcode
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 01:27:57 and also will the old game still be able to be played
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 01:07:29 you know what
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 01:07:48 i dont think i have ever used the spring ever in a build
