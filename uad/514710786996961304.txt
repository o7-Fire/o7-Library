contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:15:58 I have an idea
contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:16:58 I wanted the solar systems to win, but inators won instead so

I'm gonna build the "SolarSystems-Inator"
contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:17:52 Idk I think
contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:19:14 It's too hot in the tri state area so doof just makes an inator to create a super chilly solar system...or something
contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:19:40 Idk it makes little sense but neither do most of his plans so I mean

Fitting?
contest-chat 2022-07-31 07:24:18 Idk as long as the mods have no objections ill do it
