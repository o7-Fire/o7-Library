creations-chat 2021-02-06 14:15:25 I don't have a problem with other creations it just seems like anything other than that isn't really liked
I didn't get to explain it because of this amazing cooldown
creations-chat 2021-02-06 23:06:02 damn bro kinda hurts but ok.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:06:44 So what could I do to upgrade this?
Like what
gay slowdown
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:10:21 bruh i gotta use rockets inside?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:12:21 I used a motor lock and made a propeller on a previous model and it didn't uhh.. propel.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:14:22 i used wedges for the blades
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:17:10 Well I wanted to make something smaller so I've barely got room for rockets inside
bot-central 2021-02-07 01:18:48 is this where I make a suggestion?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:19:11 Where is it
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:25:05 ez

bot-central 2021-02-07 01:25:49 =suggest
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:28:45 you know your CA90 pic is at 68
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:31:32 Well im gonna repaint my plane, remove a window piece, see what I can do about the rear gun, make a custom prop, and I'll see about the fitting the rocket inside.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:49:26 what settings should I use for a custom prop
creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:51:32 <@773699011059908640> people are always gonna want wedges and motor lock or some other crap. It's pretty cringe.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:54:31 What is it supposed to be?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:57:02 Well im off to a *great* start. What should I change?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:59:32 Ah ok it looks good tho
creations-chat 2021-02-07 16:53:25 How does motor lock make something better? I've only seen it used for making custom props.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:07:29 Yeah but how could I do it?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:10:01 how could it create or windshield or wing?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:12:27 ok ill just do yt for assistance
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:23:37 I can only see myself using motor lock for wings since wedges are already a thing <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:25:39 good point but I barely make aircraft of that size
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:28:54 so there's different types of motor locking now?
<:Bruh:589676002221883403>
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:30:56 Why the hell would you need to bend motors what even is that
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:36:21 Just call it whatever you want and move on
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:40:26 "tEcHnIcAlLy!!"
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:58:20 He does a bit of trolling
creations-chat 2021-02-07 23:26:55 Im gonna try and make a wildcat. Not gonna post it cuz I might reach the record for most downvoted creation <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-07 23:29:00 I think I was lucky to not get low effort last time
creations-chat 2021-02-08 00:43:55 Im debating over whether to post my F4 Wildcat since I think it actually turned out pretty well. Which is what I thought for the Dauntless which ended up getting like 30 downvotes <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 00:49:57 Screw it I can take the downvotes again
creations-chat 2021-02-08 00:58:31 anyone got any suggestions? <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 01:01:37 the ratio is actually decent <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 03:23:20 is it possible to add something that looks like a brace?
creations-chat 2021-02-08 03:25:39 This line that goes from the wing to the back of the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-02-08 04:20:50 I meant that line that stretches from the *canopy* to the tail that you see on older planes
creations-chat 2021-02-08 21:19:53 They just play music
Why would you need music in a building game
creations-chat 2021-02-08 21:31:59 Unless you wanna play some meme music while using a shredder then go ahead and buy it <:empty:794431705070174238>
