plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:07:41 too bad drones/multicopters aren't a rank for this server since that is my specialty
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:08:28 ok.......
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:11:23 this is going to be an absolute pain to make a drone with 4000+ blocks and not crash my laptop
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:13:38 what should i make decacopter, octocopter, hexacopter, or quadcopter
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:13:54 do it
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:18:33 can i get an answer to this?

general 2021-02-07 05:06:19 no
general 2021-02-07 05:06:29 Mech is short for mechanic lol
general 2021-02-07 05:06:37 no

general 2021-02-07 05:08:16 there
general 2021-02-07 05:10:18 https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
general 2021-02-07 05:12:01 hey how'd you get inventor rank? what'd you do?
general 2021-02-07 05:12:16 like?
general 2021-02-07 05:12:58 so?
general 2021-02-07 05:14:38 show us the joystick
general 2021-02-07 05:16:05 <@!790732709559271444> show us the joystick that you used hover thrusters for xD
general 2021-02-07 05:16:31 never
general 2021-02-07 05:17:04 there's no joystick
general 2021-02-07 05:17:39 meh
general 2021-02-07 05:17:59 I can make one that you can control by moving the joystick with your character
general 2021-02-07 05:18:27 tell me in 2 words how to make it
general 2021-02-07 05:18:38 no
general 2021-02-07 05:18:42 hover thrusters
general 2021-02-07 05:18:56 mhm
general 2021-02-07 05:19:01 and also hover thrusters
general 2021-02-07 05:19:35 and if you don't get why you need it go to dam78's channel
general 2021-02-07 05:21:06 then you would know that your character isn't strong enough to push a joystick controlling a plane with alot of drag
general 2021-02-07 05:21:24 no
general 2021-02-07 05:23:52 https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A

general 2021-02-07 05:30:15 I could let you have one
general 2021-02-07 05:30:31 I can lend you a hand on it
general 2021-02-07 05:30:57 but i'm going to teach you the motor system
general 2021-02-07 05:31:04 bc all of mine are fuly motor controlled
general 2021-02-07 05:32:03 who knows what APHEFSDS means?
general 2021-02-07 05:32:28 correct
general 2021-02-07 05:33:02 yes

general 2021-02-07 06:03:23 bye gn
general 2021-02-07 17:29:38 Is it possible at all to obtain the inventor rank?
general 2021-02-07 17:30:04 I made the first ever 3 axis gimbal
general 2021-02-07 17:30:16 https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
general 2021-02-07 17:30:26 gimbal
bot-central 2021-02-07 17:31:38 !servers
bot-central 2021-02-07 17:31:47 why
general 2021-02-07 17:40:16 hey I need help
general 2021-02-07 17:41:17 How am I supposed to put my 3 axis gimbal in creations when the only way to show that it works is a vid?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 17:48:30 This is the only way I can show my gimbal bc I can't post it in <#384025409945337856> so... https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:16:26 what's your feedback on this
https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
too bad I can't get inventor rank from this
the first ever 3 axis gimbal
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:23:30 ikr
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:25:33 it's a gimbal
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:27:53 the point in the gimbal is to keep the cam upright and make it more cinematic
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:30:16 not rlly I can make it fully locked but I didn't want to
I would just need to add weights to the gyros
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:32:30 it's not zoomed in i'm just looking through the camera(edit your post to respond^^)

I don't want ppl to copy me
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:38:58 it's not easily copied <@!718006867808485447> yes there is better camera drones BUT THEY'RE NOT DRONES

they're quads
quadcopters
yes
bc the ping will disappear after you've already seen it
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:43:27 Also I built my quad in like 2 mins (not including the gimbal which is the first ever working 3 axis gimbal)
all the ones i've seen were 2 axis or 1 axis gimbals
no it's not
hold on i'll post a real vid of it
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:46:06 ok
give me 8 mins
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:51:07 https://youtu.be/pn8j_lGjNdU afk
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:56:37 thruster stabilized? how does that make sense

LOL

I told you it's gyros but ok

Watch it again but this time turn up your volume

Not thrusters
general 2021-02-08 16:42:36 Why is inventor unobtainable now anyway?
general 2021-02-08 16:43:14 But I made the first ever 3 axis gimbal 😦
general 2021-02-08 16:43:52 it's actually smart
general 2021-02-08 16:43:58 not very long ago
general 2021-02-08 16:44:01 a week ago
general 2021-02-08 16:44:15 faster takeoff

general 2021-02-08 16:45:15 ok?

general 2021-02-08 16:52:38 I want somebody to show me a vid of somebody using a 3 axis gimbal besides mine https://youtu.be/iVcfdQYOM_A
general 2021-02-08 16:53:43 BRUH it's not a drone aka UAV

general 2021-02-09 04:02:11 no
general 2021-02-09 04:02:25 they can fly with 33.33% of their limbs
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:03:32 It's not quite a shredder bug (no cutters)
bot-central 2021-02-09 17:55:26 how do I make a suggestion?

bot-central 2021-02-09 17:58:58 The only one I can get with my specialties is the inventor rank
bot-central 2021-02-09 17:59:03 that's unobtainable
bot-central 2021-02-09 17:59:46 I even made a 3 axis gimbal
bot-central 2021-02-09 17:59:55 well me and <@!547059243631640580>

bot-central 2021-02-09 18:08:18 unicorn*
general 2021-02-09 18:23:55 Has anybody ever made a APHEFSDS?
general 2021-02-09 18:24:51 no they can be very useful
general 2021-02-09 18:25:04 if you drop them from a bomber like a b-56
general 2021-02-09 18:25:30 to make it useful
general 2021-02-09 18:25:42 each round is one kill
general 2021-02-09 18:26:25 one confirmed kill
general 2021-02-09 18:27:18 yes
general 2021-02-09 18:27:49 It would actually be effective from anywhere
general 2021-02-09 18:28:54 you would launch them individually
general 2021-02-09 18:29:03 since they would be guided
general 2021-02-09 18:29:40 all you have to do is spam the bot central
general 2021-02-09 18:29:42 in vc
general 2021-02-09 18:30:24 is there any way I can get inventor rank
general 2021-02-09 18:30:58 great so my 3 axis gimbal is useless now
general 2021-02-09 18:31:04 except for making cinema vids
general 2021-02-09 18:31:17 the what?
general 2021-02-09 18:31:36 why?

general 2021-02-09 18:33:44 But the thing is I don't make things like planes and boats I make technical stuff
general 2021-02-09 18:33:59 what?
general 2021-02-09 18:34:11 oh
general 2021-02-09 18:34:26 But the only things that I make fit into the inventor category
general 2021-02-09 18:34:34 nothing else
general 2021-02-09 18:34:50 hi

general 2021-02-09 18:38:29 bye
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:28:58 I hate the fact that mpes are unstable
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:29:09 ik how
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:29:28 I know how to make them perm split
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:29:52 don't know how to do pistons but ik do know how to do half pistons
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:21 put it on lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:31 and don't activate the piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:38 b-52
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:43 or 56
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:52 or u2
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:30:58 spy plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:31:06 f16
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:31:18 p-51 mustang if you don't like that one
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:32:34 it shouldn't
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:32:53 no it works
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:34:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:35:00 but set it to a junk key
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:35:11 you keep activating the pistons
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:36:12 don't know why
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:36:19 put it on toggle
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:36:34 and then you'll be able to go invis
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:36:51 but don't teleport
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:37:02 it'll break your jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:37:38 show me your placement
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:38:28 switch it around
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:38:42 the other part of the piston needs to be attached to the jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:41:02 try a different spawn area
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:41:05 like the airport
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:41:10 bye
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:41:46 https://streamable.com/2q3816
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:41:56 it works
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:42:28 and yes i'm in 3rd person with a camera
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:42:38 it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:42:56 do you have physics on your anchor block?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:43:42 then I can't help you
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:43:51 wait...
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:43:58 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:44:15 XD
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:44:29 You put one side of the piston on the inside of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:44:44 don't
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:45:13 you toggle cloak by anchoring the anchor
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:45:41 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:45:54 on the piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:46:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:46:38 and anchor to cloak
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:48:31 I'm a solid wasd only person
creations-chat 2021-02-09 21:16:40 I DID
I posted https://streamable.com/rg671g in creations and I got a dm from channel bot saying you cannot post videos it is a image-only channel
https://streamable.com/4924br here this is proof
creations-chat 2021-02-09 21:23:33 BRUH
the gimbal legit has 3 gyros
creations-chat 2021-02-09 21:26:10 I do
I was just showing that it worked and that it wasn't just a bunch of helium and ballast
(I got that comment)
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:36:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:36:33 He didn't invent stealth
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:37:00 You never invented stealth
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:37:10 <@!685682790741835817> made stealth
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:37:26 He is the only person who legit made it
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:37:33 he discovered it originally
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:38:03 More like invis
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:41:52 One question WHY ARE HALF WEDGE DOWNS HEAVIER THAN HALF BLOCKS
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:42:15 I said why
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:42:31 lazy coding lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:44:52 that makes no sense it's a block not gui of config block
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:45:19 he can't change the density?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:45:43 noep
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:45:45 nope*
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:46:03 helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:46:05 ballast
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:46:30 ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:48:25 https://streamable.com/tr39cp my new quad i'm making
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:49:28 It only protects against short term raids not long term raids
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:49:47 long term being ppl join over time and then attack
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:49:50 at once
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:49:59 say a month later
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:54:02 Survey time has anybody seen an omni bug in game ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii0lhZw1BCU
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:54:18 oh yeah can't add reactions
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:57:00 uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:57:40 you met the creator of the omni bug then
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:58:10 his name is stalkersanta(some numbers)
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:59:28 somebody's gonna search stalkersanta(some numbers) aren't they
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:00:09 the only point I see in raiding is for the fun and games
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:01:39 If anybody has planes/jets make them fabric or ice material
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:02:13 bc it's lightweight
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:11:22 It wasn't a troll
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:11:41 You obviously don't do it to the wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:11:45 just the blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:13:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:13:20 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:13:24 same weight as default
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:13:41 i'm not lying
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:14:07 I've tested it unlike most ppl who have played this game for years
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:14:53 nope
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:15:18 it's not heavier
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:15:55 NOOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:16:13 I said that ice isn't heavier than default
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:16:20 No it's not
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:16:54 wdym higher?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:17:58 NO IT'S NOT
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:18:06 It's the same as default
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:18:40 the only materials that differ in weight are ice and fabric
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:19:16 How
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:19:30 oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:20:08 why would you use ropes?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:21:07 and it will be equal weight
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:22:42 but they're laggy
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:26:23 glass planes
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:29:17 You sure it's a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:32:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:32:29 it's not any heavier than default
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:35:16 the entire right side is metal
creations-chat 2021-02-09 22:37:12 My screen isn't tiny the vid quality is bc I have a laptop and my graphics are all the way down for the same reason
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:43:22 idk
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 22:43:32 cruiser i think
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 00:36:29 Does anybody know what the "ignore others" function does on hover thrusters
general 2021-02-10 00:37:18 Rick what does the ignore others function on hover thrusters do?
general 2021-02-10 00:38:01 ok
general 2021-02-10 00:39:52 Too bad I can't get inventor rank for my 3 axis gimbal...
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 00:41:20 Has anybody ever made an APHEFSDS?
general 2021-02-10 00:54:14 PPL stop spamming him
general 2021-02-10 00:54:18 and pinging him
general 2021-02-10 00:54:39 Stop
general 2021-02-10 00:55:06 Geez he's been pinged 8 times in the last minute
general 2021-02-10 01:05:46 Why is the inventor rank unobtainable now? what's the reason?
general 2021-02-10 01:06:26 Me and Assault made the first ever 3 axis gimbal
general 2021-02-10 01:06:41 6 days ago
general 2021-02-10 01:07:02 Why is it closed off?
general 2021-02-10 01:07:45 Then i'm applying
general 2021-02-10 01:08:49 nope
general 2021-02-10 01:08:58 He never made it
general 2021-02-10 01:09:44 Ok
general 2021-02-10 01:10:01 I get rejected I get rejected
general 2021-02-10 01:10:13 yeah that's assault's
general 2021-02-10 01:10:55 The 3 axis gimbal on yt is my friend assault
general 2021-02-10 01:12:58 no they're all just motors
general 2021-02-10 01:13:14 it's not a gimbal
general 2021-02-10 01:19:31 I sent the request
general 2021-02-10 01:19:47 time to get rejected
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 01:38:37 10 minutes <@!522666255996682273>
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 01:38:42 of chatting
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:48:03 too bad I can't get a rank for creating things like 1x1 missiles
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:48:14 bc everybody would go for it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:53:34 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 20:54:03 1328 sps missile coming to the rescue lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:14:00 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:14:13 He's been doing a full rewrite of the game
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:14:17 so stop complaining
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:17:21 no they didn't
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:17:31 wait they did?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:17:40 why?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:18:03 how'd you get inventor?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:18:19 which is?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:18:59 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:19:04 are you serious
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:19:32 Yeah I do actually
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:19:54 And that got you inventor?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:19:56 how
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:20:45 hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:20:55 they could be used actually
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:27:03 At least I still know how to make false 1x1 missiles
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:27:33 (idc if you copy I have plenty of these designs)
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:32:59 bc they are actually useful
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:31 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:33:43 lol no
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:00 But they are very useful for a joystick
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:10 bc they interact with characters
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:28 why?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:34 what would be the point
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:38 I don't want to
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:34:44 it's already been made
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:35:12 untrue
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:35:38 Doesn't make any sense^^^
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:30 I don't own the server
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:36:46 and I wasn't acting like it either
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:37:33 I just think it's pretty stupid that he got inventor for something as stupid as moving blocks with the vibrations of ropes
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:06 You can't
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:38:20 from my understanding you can't get it at all anymore
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:40:14 This is perfect for getting inventor rank <---Sarcasm
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:40:55 they've made 7 block wide christie suspension?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:43:14 Out of curiosity how many ppl have made a 1x1 missile?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:43:28 ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:44:15 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:01 oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:45:57 Totally just a couple stacks of motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:46:27 I do
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:47:03 That's what I originally thought
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:48:15 I've seen that guy on yt
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:48:26 He taught me how to make them originally
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:50:25 Guess what's better, more broken, and op than the cloaking "tech"
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:51:07 A glitch that can yeet any build off the map
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:51:11 portable
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:51:14 no ropes
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:51:22 nope
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:51:50 I'm talking about my glitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:52:17 that can yeet builds and ruin all motors upon touching it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:52:27 ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:52:53 but he doesn't know he owns them
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:53:23 Not what I meant
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:53:46 He doesn't know what glitches are in his game
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:54:34 Mine is gamebreaking
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:55:01 It can instantly destroy any build
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:55:08 in non pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:55:36 were
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:55:58 12 plots? I think you counted wrong xD
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:57:34 Why is the motor system for multicopters so rare
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:57:49 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:58:35 DON'T CALL IT A DRONE
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:59:23 It's not a drone unless it's a uav
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:59:31 quadcopter
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 21:59:38 it's not
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:00:38 This is the motor system (It controls yaw, pitch, roll, and elevation)
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:00:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:02:31 Plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:03:00 Prob not
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:04:28 over engineered swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:04:55 reasonable
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:06:02 yeah too under-engineered
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:08:54 Respectable
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:09:22 1:1
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:11:23 has anybody made working afterburners? besides an engine with on/off mode enabled
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:12:09 I made one
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:12:34 I already have
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:12:49 I already did
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:13:29 I DID
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:13:34 Mine is functional
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:14:33 Hover thruster, motor, trapdoor
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:14:54 not rlly
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:15:05 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:15:59 fine...
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:17:32 Btw this is the afterburner engine I could make an actual engine out of it but didn't see much use in that
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:18:00 It's either fully on or fully off
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:18:10 yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:18:21 maybe I should make an actual engine out of it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:19:00 bc that's too easy
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:19:38 I don't speak whatever this language is
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:20:13 No but that sentence made no sense
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:20:31 never said that
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:22:55 anybody want this?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:23:03 7 block long missile
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:23:37 yes ofc it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:23:40 why wouldn't it
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:24:15 so is this
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:24:37 idc
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:24:50 no kidding
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:25:08 Bc I was about to delete it from my save slots
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:51:22 If it's off it will go into ur build when turning if it's on it won't glitch into ur build 🙂
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:51:54 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:52:03 It might be the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:53:47 high contrast mode?
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:54:08 that's the same thing but ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 22:54:45 if you download some type of reshaders or smth
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:00:57 huh
plane-crazy 2021-02-24 23:01:58 I gave a very simple design to somebody but I  don't think it's me ur talking about
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:43:01 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:43:04 
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:43:13 My time played was reset
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:44:42 Are you kidding me
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:45:24 I play alot
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:45:47 Too bad I can't make you cry
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:46:16 *cough cough by punching you in the face cough cough*
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:47:01 Nothing to cry about it's just annoying
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 19:47:27 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:09:49 Super rockets don't work at all for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:10:02 they won't power up or anything
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:10:09 not even with on/off mode enabled
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:11:55 Super rockets won't work at all
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:12:28 I rejoined the game, I reloaded the slot, I changed keybinds LEGIT EVERYTHING
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:12:33 They won't work
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:12:44 none of the engines in fact
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:15:30 https://streamable.com/3xorqw
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:18:49 xD
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:19:10 I didn't even realize LOL
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:30:24 yes
bug-reports 2021-03-08 16:30:31 after that vid
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:32:53 I fixed the prob
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:33:02 it wasn't a bug I just had inf fuel off
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 16:35:44 like an absolute idiot xD
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 18:54:52 What does rick mean by pvp is now fixed?
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 18:55:07 Does that mean things don't freeze when you hit them?
general 2021-03-09 18:55:55 When Rick said that he fixed pvp does that mean things won't freeze midair when you hit them?
general 2021-03-09 18:59:27 motor lock
general 2021-03-09 18:59:43 Or just you know use a half wedge
general 2021-03-09 18:59:58 oh then motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 19:44:19 It controls the positional and rotational drag on a hover thruster
Example: Say you have a platform with 4 hover thrusters with 0 drag at each corner, if it gets pushed it won't stop(assuming that it stays on flat terrain)
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 19:44:52 it adjusts the drag
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 19:45:14 yeah...
general 2021-03-09 23:08:31 which circle is better?
general 2021-03-09 23:09:15 I'm making a rocket and you counted wrong bc that's 7x7 B)
general 2021-03-09 23:15:31 why do rockets tip to the side?
general 2021-03-09 23:16:18 Mine isn't unbalanced but it keeps tipping to the left and when I reloaded the slot it tipped to the right
general 2021-03-09 23:21:09 Proceeds to spell motor wrong
general 2021-03-09 23:21:13 lol
general 2021-03-09 23:21:51 I do now....
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:33:28 1 axis gimbal thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:33:29 https://streamable.com/s7lnid
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:33:46 i'm making it 2 axis rn
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:35:55 not much thinking involved tbh
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:36:10 i've built so man
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:36:12 many*
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:37:33 most of the thinking is put into rotating blocks lol

plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:44:34 I could make it 3 axis but then i'd have to make it even bigger
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:45:07 when the gimbal is actually activated it'll be less shaky
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:46:55 yeah I rlly don't want to make this with suspensions for every axis
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:47:21 I only have suspension for yaw rotation

plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:49:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:49:15 it makes it alot smoother

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:24:29 Camera locking is really easy and simple but more self explanatory
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:25:39 There's one gamebreaking glitch but i'm not disclosing that
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:26:41 If you know what you're doing and how to use it properly you can make small details
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:27:54 It can destroy any build in non pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:28:00 instantly
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:28:19 on contact it can destroy any build instantly
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:28:59 
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:29:02 oops
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:29:41 you can make small details like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:30:07 no it unfolds when you reload the slot
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:30:59 yeah but with camera lock you can make it compact
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:31:12 that's all it takes for that with camera lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:32:11 probably but I can't think of them atm
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:32:56 But that's laggier and uses more blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:33:09 ikr xD
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:33:55 You can't say anything openly without being criticized
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:34:24 that doesn't mean you have to make enemies

creations-chat 2021-04-27 15:31:17 It's just one of those things that you need to practice to learn.

Also, your first 3-7 motor lock builds are more than likely going to be far from perfect so lower your expectations for your first couple motor locked builds so you don't lose interest and/or determination.
general 2021-04-27 17:21:08 I don't have a rank atm but if somebody else would like this in the game feel free to post the suggestion
suggestion: when you delete your entire build instead of it always saying "delete aircraft" it will say "delete [NAME OF SLOT THAT IS CURRENTLY LOADED]"
bug-reports 2021-04-29 00:09:36 i've had this glitch before I can't replicate it tho

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:43:52 I'd be surprised if you got the answer first try
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:46:09 conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:46:24 but going fast without lag is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:46:30 hover
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:46:35 magnets are very laggy
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:46:43 not as laggy as magnets
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:47:40 It took me 1 1/2 hours to do the freaking math
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 23:48:13 oh lol thought it was an f22
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:04:00 how many lines of code make up a motor

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:05:16 omni bug?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:05:51 this?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:06:07 ah
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:06:17 so they're using the old ersion of the omni
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:06:34 what?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:07:10 yeah omnis are very effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:07:17 OH
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:07:32 i've seen them
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:08:09 they're not that bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:08:39 I wonder if they're inspired by giant squid
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:08:57 they're like bees
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:09:07 they're not very dangerous on their own
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:09:13 but in swarms they are very deadly
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:11:06 regular shredders are the same
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:11:34 but if there are too many shreds they aren't as effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:12:00 5-8 are the lucky numbers for shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:00 now you sound like a shredder bug user yourself...
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:05 ex?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:14:38 cylinders?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:15:03 fair point
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:15:08 I was a shredder user

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:19:20 can you show me another pic with better quality
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:19:48 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:20:15 ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:20:20 yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:20:41 u know how fast it is?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:20:55 the plane thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:21:08 800?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:21:10 600?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:21:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:22:51 nah it just doesn't have very many wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:23:16 445 is a decent speed but not very fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:23:33 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:23:55 he has thrust vector I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:24:12 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:24:18 just giant elevators
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:25:16 me when I fly 3796 sps average
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:25:57 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:32:57 the tracks look pretty bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:17 and the overhang is too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:34 ik
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:33:53 he can build whatever he wants
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:34:03 wait is it already a half wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:34:25 He DID NOT ask either
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:35:57 I'm still trying to figure out why I spent 1 1/2 hours doing math to for the most efficient hover drive space to speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:36:05 perfect
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 01:36:50 I don't think my mom would ever let me buy smth in a game
bot-central 2021-05-08 01:48:08 how to make a suggestion
bot-central 2021-05-08 01:48:15 how do i make a suggestion
bot-central 2021-05-08 01:48:18 there
bot-central 2021-05-08 01:49:18 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:13:18 nah it's not a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:13:37 but it is a knockoff of an already made missile
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:25:15 Has this dude not read the suggestions? https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/507673335816126509/840402516017020988
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:25:35 rick said that he tried everything to get outlines back
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:25:43 what does he think changed?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:27:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:40:51 wdy,
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 02:40:56 wdym*
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:59:27 which version?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:59:39 the one with spinning cutters or stationary?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 18:59:57 tbh both of those are quite easy to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:00:36 yeah they are
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:00:39 they do more dmg
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:00:46 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:02:01 Question: do you not know how a shredder bug works?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:02:32 then destroying them should be ez for you
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:02:38 which
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:02:41 omnibugs?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:01 ez pz
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:25 the balls are terrible to try and take out
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:30 those are nearly impossibe
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:34 impossible*
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:46 just outrun them
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:04:17 however they're great to take out traditional shreds
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:04:35 those are quite easy to annihilate
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:04:42 horizon?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:05:11 how they only go 638 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:05:50 well
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:06:18 if you have a good glitch engine design you can outrun them without very much lag or shake
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:06:47 Hehe totally don't have the best conveyor and hover engine design
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:07:11 the seed of your motors are too fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:07:20 make it to 1.2 speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:07:27 then try
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:07:55 if it still shakes turn the speed down even more
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:10 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:20 all the tutorials on yt shake and freak out
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:27 no big
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:29 too*
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:53 I have one that's virtually 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:09:12 and is perfect
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:09:18 it doesn't glitch out whatsoever
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:09:36 it doesn't even rotate the plane like all other conveyor engines do
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:09:54 just talk
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:10:22 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:10:33 you lost me here
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:10:55 pic in dms?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:14:38 HAHAHAHAHa
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:14:44 HaHaHaHa
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:14:49 xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:15:22 did you let it upload and process before uploading it?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 17:11:02 anybody know if this can be simplified?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 17:12:20 if it can't then poggers bc this is my first time using piston lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 17:20:56 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 17:26:48 I saw ur msg
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 17:26:53 <@!630466103671259150>
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:04:50 the one that said reply if see message
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:05:46 you can't reply to a deleted message
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:07:02 you can only reply to it while the message is still there
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:07:44 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:08:01 I got that from clyde^
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 18:16:20 yes!
bug-reports 2021-05-10 00:22:14 this is the exact same on both sides WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS
bug-reports 2021-05-10 01:47:53 Look at the left and right intakes
bug-reports 2021-05-10 01:48:32 no
bug-reports 2021-05-10 01:48:45 trust me you can't it's the exact same on both sides
bug-reports 2021-05-10 01:48:52 i've rebuilt both
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:01:35 you don't
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:16:54 bru
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:17:04 It is a feature now
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:17:15 it used to be a glitch I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:17:23 and then it got accepted as a feature
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:17:41 yes very convenient
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:17:55 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:18:27 if rick didn't keep it in the game legit 60% of plane crazy users would quit
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:19:38 gm
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:20:00 glitched mouse more than likely
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:22:28 I use gm for pvp planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:27:40 This is a really stupid and funny that i'm asking, but what should I post on my yt channel. xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 22:50:48 Yes xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 22:51:04 I had just joined plane crazy when I said that ignorant statement
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 22:51:25 That's actually my alt account
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 22:51:44 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 04:13:09 this is plane crazy physics xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 04:16:33 I went 300 and I was flying
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 04:17:09 I bet any old player knows exactly what I did
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 04:18:23 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 04:18:28 not een close

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:18:29 I prob do but I hae no clue what a "sprocket" is lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:18:38 (sorry can't type half of w)
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:19:09 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:19:46 good thing you said that lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:20:36 that's been happening to people in the armada too
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:42:51 what about a working HUD lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:43:24 Do you think that a working HUD is "cool"xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:43:58 fighter jet

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:45:25 ok lol idc
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:46:32 more than that but ok lol

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:46:58 Wonderful weather we're having
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:47:02 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:47:15 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:47:21 Do you not know what a hud is?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:47:56 no i'm talking about a hud that fits inside of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:49:14 ez
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:49:34 I'll make a streamable rq
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:53:23 Working thrust meter on the left(tuned for a super rocket engine) and a line that stays level to the ground at all times
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:54:21 If you copy this you have a skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:55:12 text lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:56:21 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:57:50 dude
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:57:55 you're ranked
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:58:04 how do you not know this stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:58:26 in fairness you did join yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:01:35 I make good planes(when I actually care about how it looks)I make missiles that destroy any build instantly(including 6k+ builds) I also make technical contraptions like that hud
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:01:55 I've also made a compact dependent christie's suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:02:07 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:02:14 emm
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:02:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:02:24 on contact actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:03:17 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:03:22 and i'm not telling you how
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:03:55 I can tell you're very curious
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:04:21 I can make a 30 block missile do it
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:04:26 B)
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:04:46 Oh it can
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:04:56 but i'm not joining a server with you in it
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:05:12 because I know you'll try to copy it/see how it works any chance you get
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:05:36 Yes, and i've done it.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:06:58 I **said** copy/see how it ***works***
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:07:28 I know you will
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:07:34 because you act just like me
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:07:59 I like them on occasion
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:08:05 I get tired of them sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:08:38 I mean they're gone the entire build
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:08:49 you can do it with a single block of tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:09:13 By hitting the pilot
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:09:14 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:09:25 but there is another way
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:09:34 which is confidential to the Armada
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:10:03 I was
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:10:19 also
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:10:28 it doesn't use any explosive blocks to destroy the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:11:31 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:11:51 doesn't use anything in pvp section...
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:11:53 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:12:11 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:12:33 dm me it then
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:16:53 Let me change that >:>
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:17:19 i'm not serious lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:17:23 it's a joke
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:21:57 I bet **NONE** of you know what the most efficient number of hover thrusters for a hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:13 XD
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:15 WRONG
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:21 dead wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:29 no lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:33 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:36 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:40 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:48 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:55 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:22:57 also
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:23:04 POG
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:23:08 Nobody knows
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:23:19 lol I spent 2 hours doing math
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:23:22 to figure it out
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:23:55 My conveyor engine that never glitches out
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:24:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:24:30 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:24:41 every single conveyor engine design that i've came across
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:24:44 glitches out
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:25:04 it'll start having a seizure
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:25:20 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:25:29 it does the same with motors and suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:26:06 once you fly them around for a bit they start twisting and turning your aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:26:08 and they jerk
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:26:52 every single design on yt glitches out xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:27:15 I would like to see that design
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:27:27 curious if we have the same design
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:27:56 for* plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:28:21 I bunch of multiplication
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:28:50 those glitch
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:31:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:32:25 ectored thrust tho lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:32:40 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:32:42 ss?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:32:47 (screenshot)
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:36:16 wedges to make thrust is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:36:38 Imagine if the "ski drive" was real
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:41:26 sorry...
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:41:34 but a wedges drive is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:41:58 If it really did work it had smth to do with motors
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:42:04 hi
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:42:25 Depressed, the usual
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:42:39 lol i'm jk dude
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:44:30 Can't wait for my new lock picking set to get to my house
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:45:01 to arrive
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:45:09 At least i'll have a hobby
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:45:16 I have no life
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:45:35 i've never even been on vacation...
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:46:23 xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:47:28 <@456226577798135808> I can make you a missile if you would like
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:47:57 Just choose which one you want
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:48:04 1x1, 2x3, or 3x3
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:48:38 2x3s are good for bvr
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:49:07 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:49:10 don
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:49:15 don't think so*
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:51:30 i'll gladly make one for you
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:51:38 one problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:51:48 they require motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:52:30 gl then
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 19:53:25 I think I have 5-7 days experience making missiles
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:05:45 It's just a glitch that happens sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:06:25 I'm actually gonna make it real
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:06:30 with a contraption....
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:06:33 for fun
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:08:43 I use keys and sometimes glitched mouse 😎
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:09:43 from one typo to another...
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:10:12 there...
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:10:13 xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:14:24 Did somebody say suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:14:30 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:15:13 Because complex suspension works better
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:17:15 I almost made a new glitch engine yesterday

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:36:25 the goal of that was to make the smallest and most compact christie's suspension possible
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:36:41 not to make the best or most efficient suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:37:03 XD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:37:07 and it's 46 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 03:37:23 no...

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 15:26:03 the only reason it is, is because it gives me some more performece

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:22:10 Question: why does nobody build their planes backwards?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:22:15 it's actually smart
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:22:29 for pvp planes that is
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:22:43 I see one rarely
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:22:56 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:23:20 No, I mean why does nobody build their plane backwards?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:23:28 it enables the pvp plane to takeoff faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 16:23:38 and not run into shredder cars
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:15:36 Dang, I'm still slow.
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:24:58 gimme a moment to calculate
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:27:16 uh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 20:27:42 I'm probably wrong tbh but I think that every 333.3333--- is a kph

general 2021-06-17 21:11:44 I don't think that's a good idea
general 2021-06-17 21:11:55 maybe the disconnectors but not the motors
general 2021-06-17 21:13:16 Could we get ew?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:14:55 no....

general 2021-06-17 21:21:25 Rick, make it to where when you delete your entire build instead of it saying "Delete Aircraft" make it say "Delete [the slot that is currently loaded]?"
general 2021-06-17 21:21:49 no
general 2021-06-17 21:23:16 it's better than it saying delete aircraft when you have a boat loaded ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:41:12 bro my average speed for jets without cons is 3k
general 2021-06-20 03:19:33 Black people wear shirts saying black power, women wear shirts that say girl power, but if you wear a shirt that says white power you're called racist and if you wear a shirt saying boy power you're called sexist. How does this make sense?
general 2021-06-20 03:20:44 It just makes no sense XD
general 2021-06-20 03:21:48 If an old guy walks up to a girl and says that she looks pretty he's a creep, but if a good looking guys walks up to a girl and says that she looks pretty he's a kind gentleman?!?!

plane-crazy 2021-07-04 16:37:57 Did you know that if you build a big platform it will fall slower than a single block?
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 16:42:45 did you know the reason why it falls slower is bc of lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 16:42:46 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:18:17 ah
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:18:38 quite accurate
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:26:04 I want a role created that goes to people that understand game mechanics like me, but I don't have a role already to suggest it.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:04 ig
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:18 that idea was suggested
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:26 but it had a stupid suggestion in it
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:33 so it got downvoted like hell
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:29:11 tbh I have no builds that aren't quick jets for testing, missiles, torpedos, and proof of concept builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:30:07 nah
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:30:34 and if I did it would only be if gj asked me to upgrade it
general 2021-07-11 02:52:45 how can I report a deadly script that ruins the game without breaking the rules lol
general 2021-07-11 02:53:07 to who?
general 2021-07-11 02:54:26 I doubt roblox is gonna be able to fix a script that lags the hell out of servers, *only* plane crazy from what I understand
general 2021-07-11 02:54:49 no
general 2021-07-11 02:54:50 a script
general 2021-07-11 02:55:17 lags the entire server to 60k+ ping
general 2021-07-11 02:55:44 multiple people
general 2021-07-11 02:56:04 no
general 2021-07-11 02:56:08 I know who's sending it
general 2021-07-11 02:57:10 cause then more people would be able to see where it is lol
general 2021-07-11 02:57:45 people will then know where to get the script
general 2021-07-11 02:58:14 PEOPLE
general 2021-07-11 02:59:54 i'm just going to report it to rick
general 2021-07-11 03:00:01 as he's the only person that can do a thing about it
general 2021-07-11 03:00:30 PEOPLE
general 2021-07-11 03:00:43 and there's a deadly script going around
general 2021-07-11 03:01:02 it lags the fuck out of servers wdym
general 2021-07-11 03:01:19 and eventually crashes everyone
general 2021-07-11 03:02:06 scripts bypass it tho

creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:06:57 1. I sure fucking would jump out of the window :)
2. yes it's low effort, but everybody else made *no* effort

n-o
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:10:15 number 1 was a joke and 2 in short is how is it less disrespectful to not make it at all

I probably am autistic tbh and I will stop once someone answers my question without making remarks about how shitty my build was etc
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:12:55 I legit just want to know the answer i'm   done   arguing

I didn't want upvotes I could care less

My question isn't answered
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:15:24 it wasn't just a tomb it was a tomb honoring fallen soldiers and in fairness it was a shitty build so I don't really blame them for being so enraged

creations-chat 2022-08-25 01:54:41 <@1001400227154116698> Ok so suggestions...(i'm just going to make this a list)
1. the protruding disconnectors at the sides of the back of the cockpit look weird...
2. the wings are too large
3. the back wings are the wrong shape
4. you should put the super rockets directly next to eachother using motor lock
5. spread out the missiles and have them follow the wing angle instead of a straight line

Hope this helps!
creations-chat 2022-08-25 02:00:22 yes, dump robot
