general 2020-11-01 23:17:30 Hi I have a few questions about the rank request if someone can please help me. When I do $new in <#384027830192832513> do I write my request on the message or in the channel it opens up? Also, I have multiple screenshots I would like to add but I can only add one when a message is written. Please, can someone help me.
