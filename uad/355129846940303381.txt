help 2019-11-18 09:21:19 Anyone who has ideas for small custom missiles, they would be very helpful. I have a big F-14 which is in need of some armaments.
help 2019-11-18 09:21:37 And also of an airbreak
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:24:42 We need Really Big and Heavy engines that have a lot of thrust. Basically like a super huge engine.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:25:47 Except that it would have the mass of 3 full long fuel tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:26:06 So that tiny craft can not exploit
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:26:30 But big craft which already have huge mass can effectively use
creations-chat 2019-11-18 09:32:13 Can someone suggest this:

Super Huge engines. They have the mass of AT LEAST 3 full long fuel tanks. (Probably more to balance this feature.) They also have an insane amount of thrust, such that 1000 block and larger creations can go fast. This is all to make it so that small craft can Not exploit because of their craft doing loops into the ground and essentially glitching themselves to death.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:34:03 Which is why it would have a insane TWR of about 15 super rockets. It’s mainly so that we can stop having the insides of our builds be super engines.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:34:56 Also, it would have to be balanced so that it would not be effective on creations less than 500 blocks big because of power.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:35:41 Which would mean that tiny planes would have to increase their wing size by 10 fold to use it.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:36:04 This is all just estimates, but it still is a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:36:32 Fair point
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:37:35 Because of manuveability issues
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:38:27 Basically it’s like trying to stop a speeding bullet, and then turn it around
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:39:08 For big craft, it would be like flying supersonic aircraft. Slightly less maneuverable, but still very capable
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:40:13 Basically, one has big enough wings for this thing. The other is just a lazer
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:41:04 That or they could put it behind a 500 block limit
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:41:20 Which seems much more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:42:33 Have you seen The last aircraft I made
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:43:43 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:44:26 True
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:46:06 Also, how long before they start looking at ranking people? Is it that you have to wait a year, or do they just binge rank on one night a year
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:46:15 Or is it something else
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:47:12 I’m curious now since then I don’t have to ask for someone to post a suggestion

creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:44:04 <@456226577798135808>, make the angled runway your main runway. It allows all aircraft which are trying to land, to attempt to land while not hitting any aircraft which are on the front. (That’s why they use it IRL. It also allows for a lot easier of a time because you always have a clear runway and can throttle up if you aren’t stoping fast enough.
