plane-crazy 2019-04-01 08:12:29 Do you have to use fuel tanks?

plane-crazy 2019-04-01 22:55:12 Do fuel tanks have a purpose?
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 22:55:27 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 22:55:57 I thought it wasn't compulsory
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 22:56:08 And it was "optional"
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 04:30:19 When you put motors on lock it still glitches reee

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:11:13 wth happened
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:11:20 for a while my tracks stopped lagging
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:11:23 now theyre lagging again
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:11:26 is it just old servers?
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:14:14 Nope they somehow ruined the game again lo0l
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:15:51 so far this year they have added a shiny yellow lump
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:16:00 and made servers laggier
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:16:15 Amazing.
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:17:31 I love how you can look at the original version of this game
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:17:34 Compared it to what it is now
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:17:42 And see so little difference
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:22:19 They added a latter
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:22:32 A shiny gold lump
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 08:22:36 And thats about it for the past 2 years
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 01:32:17 can objects go through text now
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 09:54:53 wow they added more lag again
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 09:55:01 my tracks worked fine for like a week and they broke the game again
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 06:46:21 why are servers suddenly laggier again my tracks are unusable
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 06:46:25 the devs are legit useless
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 02:06:36 is it just because the servers new, because my tracks suddenly stopped lagging
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:29:47 woah they added the same items again
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:29:51 i knew they were lazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:02 but how can one be **t h i s la z y**
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:31:21 in 7 years nothing has changed and i dont expect anything to anymore
