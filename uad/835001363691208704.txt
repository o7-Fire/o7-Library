creations-chat 2023-06-23 04:27:30 It wasn’t the controller, it was the use of different materials causing the submersible to implode
creations-chat 2023-06-23 04:59:50 Implosion is caused due to the interior having more or less pressure than the outside, more variables can heighten the risk of implosion, not saying the materials used were bad, just not best
