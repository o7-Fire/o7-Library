creations-chat 2019-09-03 15:32:35 hello, thought I'd share my bootleg B-17 Flying Fortress. Flies under it's own power, no hidden propellers other than the ones you can see and 1 super jet in each engine bay. Fully working landing gear with suspension, bomb bay which opens, interior and bombs.

creations-chat 2019-09-03 15:38:29 don't really care for ranks/roles much but would be cool to have
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:55:26 <@!221496030355521536> it's not a b25 lol
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:55:46 <@413015454416764931> you too XD It's a b-17
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:56:00 The original plane was a b25.
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:56:05 I just forgot to rename it.
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:56:10 I overwrote the save file lol
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:56:20 yeah lmao it's all good I understand the confusion
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:56:55 I got a surprising amount of downvotes ;-;
creations-chat 2019-09-03 18:57:12 and a surprising amount of upvotes c:
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:26:55 I can't look outside my plane anymore.
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:27:00 Did they break that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:35:49 Can you only aim the motor 2 in a limited area?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:35:54 Like 180 degrees or something?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:09 I can't rotate my turret 360 degrees anymore when I replaced those blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:14 Oh so it's not 360?
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:17 That's silly but okay, thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:22 Max angle
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:24 Thanks Darkz
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:57 yeet works now
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 13:36:58 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:56:08 can someone confirm this
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:56:10 material has weight
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:56:24 and having different materials influences the weight of the craft
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:07 ya'll
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:13 does material have different weight
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:14 yes or no
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:29 what
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:33 why are people in game saying it does
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 14:58:54 <@!472385006665465857> use motor 2
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:00:59 what does servo do anyway
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:01:31 no but what does it do
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:01:35 I know it disables mouse aiming
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:01:56 seems kinda pointless to add a new block and have an option to disable it's advanced functonality
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:02:03 functionality*
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 15:02:24 oh cool thanks
general 2019-09-21 17:20:40 is PVP broken for you guys as well?
general 2019-09-21 17:20:51 keep getting attempted to teleport to a place that doesn't exist when I try to play PVP
general 2019-09-21 17:22:59 the hell
general 2019-09-21 17:23:06 I rejoined and joined so many times and it's broken
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:38:39 Hi, has anyone been able to suscessfully make a plane using motor 2's?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:38:57 as in, the wings themselves move, without the requirement for control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:39:44 Yeah that's true but I'm looking to see if anyone used motor 2's to make the plane turn with the mouse cursor
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:40:19 That's interesting... do you know who <@!322970944303923200> ?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:40:33 <@!304977711988867072> True but having the actual wings turn is a lot cooler imo ðŸ˜›
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:40:49 <@!322970944303923200> What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:42:16 I made a plane that flies without control surfaces, only using the actual wing. I'm not sure how to make the ailreons <@!322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:43:28 <@!322970944303923200> It doesn't appear to be easy, which is why I'm asking if anyone has made it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:43:37 I use my keyboard to manually turn the ailreons for now
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:43:38 but
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:43:40 that's not good so
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:44:12 <@!322970944303923200> What do you mean by sideways?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:44:20 I tried to make it sideways, it really did not work.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:44:53 <@!322970944303923200> That doesn't work though?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:45:15 I'm not new.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:45:25 I've been playing this game since before it was even really known in roblox.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:45:48 My guy, I've literally made a 1000+ brick B-17. I'm not new.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:46:26 <@!221496030355521536> He was asking me if I'm new, I'm not gloating.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:46:45 I wasnt' talking about roblox
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:46:46 what lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:46:51 I'm talking about plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:28 <@!322970944303923200> As I've said, I already have the wings set to turn on Motor 2's.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:30 Via keyboard.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:34 oh my lord
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:38 I'm actually losing my patience here
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:42 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:47:42 it's like speaking to a brick wall
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:48:09 as I've stated before, I am asking if it's possible to make the motor 2's act as ailreons and not just elevators
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:48:13 I'm not sure what you're talkingabout <@!322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:48:39 wooowoww! never knew that before...!.1.11
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:49:01 <@!322970944303923200> That's not what I'm asking.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:49:42 oof.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:49:46 Then stop saying irrelevant things.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:49:58 apparently that's a swear, shrug
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:50:31 I did, and you started talking about something else entirely
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:50:42 as in how to use motor 2's even though that's not what I asked lmao
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:14 My guy.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:17 They WORK.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:31 I'm asking if it is possible to use them as ailreons
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:34 not just elevators
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:37 with the mouse
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:41 so I don't have to use my keyboard
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:43 or control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 13:51:52 I honestly don't understand what you don't understand.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 14:48:23 <@!216193164199985152> that's awesome, thanks dude
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:07:58 <@!216193164199985152> Hey, out of curiosity, what are those wheel blocks? I've never seen them before.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:09:48 <@456226577798135808> doesn't seem like it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:09:57 those are round wheels basically
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:09:59 oh wait nvm
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:10:00 hang on
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:12:18 ahh that explains it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:12:33 That's actually really quite smart though
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:12:37 like a real converter
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:12:59 Is it okay if I try to experimentate with placing them on my plane?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:13:01 Yeah exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:13:03 It's really neat
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:13:07 appreciate it
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:16:46 <@!216193164199985152> Are you sure that's the blocks you used for the fabric bit?
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:16:57 Huh.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:16:59 Weird.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:17:02 Doesn't work for me.
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:17:03 Stuck in place
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 16:17:06 one sec
