general 2020-04-24 15:06:56 Explain.
general 2020-04-24 15:08:52 True
general 2020-04-24 15:10:15 As much as I donâ€™t like the chiron, because of all the 10 year olds who are obsessed with it, it doesnâ€™t deserve this treatment
general 2020-04-24 15:10:58 Ik it wasnâ€™t the car
general 2020-04-24 15:11:10 But how is that a bad build?
general 2020-04-24 15:11:34 Or were the down voters just memeing
general 2020-04-24 15:18:25 I see
general 2020-04-24 15:18:42 I didnâ€™t realize they were THAT high
general 2020-04-24 15:19:56 They should make a game pass or something where you can place blocks inside each other
general 2020-04-24 15:20:28 Yes
general 2020-04-24 15:27:53 Guys are there any engine types that are not affected by weight?
general 2020-04-24 15:28:35 Not like actual engines like super rocket engines, etc, player invented ones

general 2020-04-24 15:30:34 Ohhhhhh
general 2020-04-24 15:30:45 Um I think itâ€™s fine
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:29:20 Ngl this games community is pretty toxic whenever somebody posts a bad build
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:54:59 True
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:55:37 But people go out of their way to downvote those kids builds
creations-chat 2020-05-09 17:56:03 Like bad builds get more downvotes than good builds get upvotes
creations-chat 2020-05-11 17:32:05 Halo Unsc Pillar of Autumn. 7700 blocks, with a full interior. It kinda flies, but only forwards, up, and backwards, and not very consistantly. it isnt the greatest but i thought it was a good halo build
creations-chat 2020-05-11 17:32:16 
creations-chat 2020-05-11 17:35:10 WAIT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO POST OUR BUILDS IN CREATIONS LOL

general 2020-05-19 16:22:26 Question: will using mouse motors work for a direction changing magnet engine?
creations-chat 2020-05-22 13:35:07 Explain
creations-chat 2020-05-22 19:10:02 Thatâ€™s a great boat but 1900 blocks isnâ€™t THAT much
general 2020-05-23 18:51:12 I donâ€™t really like the new update where they removed the automatic color variation, it removes a lot of the texture from the builds
general 2020-05-23 18:52:10 Exactly
general 2020-05-23 18:52:26 Conconinos

The fact youâ€™re getting so many downvotes doesnâ€™t make sense. However, loxodon is not best destroyer because bad turret placement :troll:
creations-chat 2021-07-11 22:35:12 Holy shit this is incredible, creativity wise
creations-chat 2021-07-11 22:38:58 Like the design is beautiful, as a spaceship design
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:15:28 I donâ€™t understand <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:15:43 How does something like this get in
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:16:08 But something like this doesnâ€™t
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:16:35 Ah ok. But still, so many worthy builds donâ€™t get in?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:17:39 But like I said so many builds that match the quality of the recent HOF builds donâ€™t get in
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:17:41 Why
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:18:22 Ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:18:49 I guess a lot of builds get lost in that voting process
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:20:11 Ngl tho this server has the highest standards Iâ€™ve ever seen for a Roblox building game
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:20:57 No Iâ€™d say the standards are higher
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:21:06 Not for HOF
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:21:10 Just in general
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:22:03 In what way
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 18:22:21 Yeah
