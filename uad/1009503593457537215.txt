general 2022-10-23 16:09:31 but im proud of it
general 2022-10-23 16:09:50 in terms of design it needs abit of work, but it resembles a starship as it should

general 2022-10-24 13:17:15 oldest trick in the book, an ''old build''
general 2022-10-24 13:17:34 i insist
general 2022-10-24 13:18:00 why is it saturated in colour
general 2022-10-24 13:18:10 the stones are way too bright done you think
general 2022-10-24 13:18:13 dont
general 2022-10-24 13:18:55 you used stairs for the roof?
general 2022-10-24 13:20:11 i see
general 2022-10-24 13:21:31 dock to my dreamchaser?
general 2022-10-24 13:21:40 which is also docked to soyuz
general 2022-10-24 13:22:22 i couldnt lock it all together so easily.
general 2022-10-24 13:22:31 quick question
general 2022-10-24 13:22:53 why does youre station have no structure? its all just twists and turns
general 2022-10-24 13:23:42 but stations where never like that
general 2022-10-24 13:24:32 they had the capsules and the laboratories in short sector's not huge lines going to infinity.
general 2022-10-24 13:25:28 should try space engineers
general 2022-10-24 13:25:41 can i see it ingame
general 2022-10-24 13:25:52 id be happy to visually explore
general 2022-10-24 13:26:10 oh.
general 2022-10-24 13:26:23 oh..
general 2022-10-24 13:26:54 turn up youre graphics, it will make it look better
general 2022-10-24 13:26:56 on god
general 2022-10-24 13:27:08 graphics add the corner shadow and its life changing
general 2022-10-24 13:27:37 see thats more like it
general 2022-10-24 13:28:24 maybe add trails as handles like on the iss? so its easier for astronauts to move from one place to the next
general 2022-10-24 13:29:14 this is my space station interior, rate it guys/
general 2022-10-24 13:29:53 hey man i only got so little to work with in terms of materials, give me a break
general 2022-10-24 13:30:39 i used spotlights and kept testing the colour
general 2022-10-24 13:30:57 settings
general 2022-10-24 13:31:54 i wanted to give it this dim atmopshere without making it too saturated since i knew if it had too much colour it would ruin it
general 2022-10-24 13:32:27 i could try and do level 0
general 2022-10-24 13:33:05 day (i stopped counting at year 3) of waiting for pc2
general 2022-10-24 13:37:32 its not my highest top quality build ever but id say it isnt the worst out there
general 2022-10-24 13:40:29 it wouldve requied alot of motor lock to make them join at each corner
general 2022-10-24 13:40:51 and its pretty big.
general 2022-10-24 13:41:15 yes but what im waying it
general 2022-10-24 13:41:33 you cant join trails together
general 2022-10-24 13:42:07 not nessesarly accurate since the backrooms is randomly generated
general 2022-10-24 13:48:05 ive returned

general 2022-10-25 12:35:14 i made a plane crazy plot concept in studio
general 2022-10-25 12:36:24 well i didnt wanna make it dramatically oversized
general 2022-10-25 12:36:31 on god
general 2022-10-25 12:37:08 its a reasonable size since builds are getting more advanced and players need more space
general 2022-10-25 12:37:32 ahh
general 2022-10-25 12:38:25 the space issue is the same in the orginal.
general 2022-10-25 12:38:37 the design sucks so i thought i could improve
general 2022-10-25 12:39:12 ill be back.
general 2022-10-25 12:40:02 ill come back with something better
general 2022-10-25 12:45:03 space for builds to fold backwards and ramps for off road builds
general 2022-10-25 12:45:36 its a concept not the actual map lol
general 2022-10-25 12:46:16 it would be unfair for people on the 2nd plot
general 2022-10-25 12:47:20 point is, its just an idea to solve this current abomination of plot issues
general 2022-10-25 12:48:13 i mean id for sure prefair this plot design and alot of other people would apart from floppa lol

general 2022-10-26 16:25:57 i made a docking mechanism
general 2022-10-26 16:27:25 yes, the wedge are hooks that fit into half block wedge slots. this resolves the problem of trying to slide the hooks in perfectly
general 2022-10-26 16:28:53 the person who is docking would have no struggle getting the block in
general 2022-10-26 16:30:32 i have a whole sever for space builders in plane crazy, just recently i docked my starship to a fellow space guy

general 2022-11-06 21:57:25 the snoop that went droop
general 2022-11-07 00:51:54 i made some rockets for my atlas gemini, they gimbal fairly well and remain fairly stable during flight
general 2022-11-07 00:52:45 (side note: it cannot handle the scorching temperatures of the sun, this has been noted.)
general 2022-11-07 00:54:00 they got pasted the atmopshere, they are currently incinerating in lava right now
general 2022-11-07 00:54:11 gemini engines are just another breed
general 2022-11-07 00:54:39 challenge accepted
general 2022-11-07 00:54:40 weait
general 2022-11-07 00:54:42 wait
general 2022-11-07 00:54:50 i have a nuclear reactor in orbit
general 2022-11-07 00:55:06 i can dock it to the nuke and feed it some uranium c325
general 2022-11-07 00:56:23 hey basewar
general 2022-11-07 00:56:42 ill just dock it to my nuclear powered station
general 2022-11-07 00:57:45 if i did that my phone would split an atom
general 2022-11-07 01:08:28 my honest reaction
general 2022-11-07 01:09:52 it happened for me.
general 2022-11-07 01:10:20 on god.
general 2022-11-07 01:10:50 angry roblox men energy
general 2022-11-07 01:17:15 i have completed the inside of a volcano i made, now i must find some audio for ambience
general 2022-11-07 01:18:13 its not the only room
general 2022-11-07 01:18:48 alot of them have obsidian and lava type texture
general 2022-11-07 01:19:55 that statue of me fr buggin out, i need to adjust textures on that thing
general 2022-11-07 04:00:32 iss mfs in plane crazy after the lights randomly turn off for the 8467626723782536788777 time.
general 2022-11-07 04:01:49 it is, but it has 2 endings with and without pvp
general 2022-11-07 04:03:48 death by razor blade on solar panel
general 2022-11-07 04:04:23 white name activity.
general 2022-11-07 04:04:44 iss does look better on other angles though.
general 2022-11-07 04:05:13 that was a chinese spacecraft who docked to the iss, and alot of cubes saying food just spilled in.
general 2022-11-07 04:05:51 its not my only station.
general 2022-11-07 04:06:13 show us youre build mrs whitename.
general 2022-11-07 04:06:19 thank.
general 2022-11-07 04:06:50 im a huge space guy in this game, i docked to this guys space station with my capsule
general 2022-11-07 04:07:01 im still amazed how his docking mechanism matched with mine
general 2022-11-07 04:07:32 death.
general 2022-11-07 04:08:19 i tried doing this to one of my older builds, it turned out like this, but the launch tower remained the same.
general 2022-11-07 04:09:37 i thought of that myself, but the u would overlap the line.
general 2022-11-07 04:10:16 but for sure, this is my best space build so far.
general 2022-11-07 04:11:53 yeah, you're right, im usually lectured because i didnt add motor lock since alot of the time plane crazy logic is just purely no motor lock = bad
general 2022-11-07 04:13:02 im better at studio though.
general 2022-11-07 04:13:25 agreed
general 2022-11-07 04:14:10 the map has alot more too it, its a current game im working on
general 2022-11-07 04:14:40 a statue of me in the back and the scripter in the front
general 2022-11-07 04:15:06 terrain is unpredictable, comes in all shapes and sizes
general 2022-11-07 04:15:17 it can be rough and smooth
general 2022-11-07 04:15:34 gah dayum
general 2022-11-07 04:15:42 is that the game where u build mechs.
general 2022-11-07 04:16:01 ive always tried it, could never do it
general 2022-11-07 04:16:12 some guy made obsidian fury last time i played.
general 2022-11-07 04:16:24 old enough
general 2022-11-07 04:16:29 which is
general 2022-11-07 04:16:40 old
general 2022-11-07 04:16:44 im an old old man
general 2022-11-07 04:16:52 i cant walk, one could say
general 2022-11-07 04:17:17 im currently on antibiotic's and im devorced and my children wont see me anymore.
general 2022-11-07 04:17:33 1
general 2022-11-07 04:17:34 5
general 2022-11-07 04:18:09 im at collage right now believe it or not
general 2022-11-07 04:18:30 thank you, i truely apprieciate it.
general 2022-11-07 04:19:05 i one day wish to solve einsteins theory of relativity.
general 2022-11-07 04:21:31 ive made multipule suggestions to nasa, obviously never responded but i suggested when the ISS returns to earth, the next station has an artifical gravity ring.
general 2022-11-07 04:22:22 you email them, they respond in 10-15 business days
general 2022-11-07 04:22:45 yes
general 2022-11-07 04:23:03 it creats artifical gravity for astronauts
general 2022-11-07 04:24:00 when they return to earth after months, they usually have severe back pains due to the gravity. so an artifical gravity ring actual helps them with exerise and prevents bone density problems
general 2022-11-07 04:24:38 and sometimes they completely collapse since there legs cant handle there own body weight
general 2022-11-07 04:25:29 correct, the ring rotates like a gyroscope and it keeps the station balanced and obviously fixes alot of problems.
general 2022-11-07 04:25:44 it sometimes increases velocity.
general 2022-11-07 04:27:25 but in space, the water would turn into a sphere
general 2022-11-07 04:27:54 because water has no center of mass.
general 2022-11-07 04:28:21 in space, you have no sensation of up and down
general 2022-11-07 04:28:33 always wanted to know what that feeling has.
general 2022-11-07 04:28:54 correct, but water is really unbalanced.
general 2022-11-07 04:29:13 it has mass, its just technically evenly spread out
general 2022-11-07 04:29:35 which is why the earth is tidally locked
general 2022-11-07 04:30:02 how is it not?
general 2022-11-07 04:30:22 if the moon disappeared right now, we'd be facing skycraper sized tsunami's
general 2022-11-07 04:31:53 i got something really cool actually
general 2022-11-07 04:32:12 i took a photo of jupiter from my phone, pretty cool right
general 2022-11-07 04:33:38 just somethings i covered up, i stupidly wrote text on it and it saved so i dont have orginal image
general 2022-11-07 04:34:32 ill show you something that will make you go even crazier
general 2022-11-07 04:35:00 this abomination of mine
general 2022-11-07 04:35:21 the endurance.
general 2022-11-07 04:35:24 and the ranger..
general 2022-11-07 04:35:39 best i can say, i improved.
general 2022-11-07 04:35:45 
general 2022-11-07 04:35:58 animal crossing in space
general 2022-11-07 04:36:18 that was inside the capsule.
general 2022-11-07 04:36:51 once it returned to earth they just locked it away in a military grade vault. and nobody really knows why
general 2022-11-07 04:37:21 that isnt true,
general 2022-11-07 04:37:27 but you know what is true.
general 2022-11-07 04:37:30 moon cheese.
general 2022-11-07 04:37:39 im almost convinced moon cheese exists.
general 2022-11-08 20:37:18 somethings wrong, i can feel it.
general 2022-11-08 20:38:26 it would be worse if it was the only thing installed.
general 2022-11-08 20:39:34 i try and play more new games at a time
general 2022-11-08 20:39:51 i plan on getting subnautica below zero next
general 2022-11-08 20:40:33 you can easily remove the watermark using tools
general 2022-11-08 20:41:04 never tried it
general 2022-11-08 20:41:53 ive just never heard of it
general 2022-11-08 20:42:42 until now i havent
general 2022-11-08 20:43:53 i need to complete this saturn v on space engineers and get some video of it, is there really a quality difference
general 2022-11-08 20:44:12 bandicam is pretty smooth
general 2022-11-08 20:45:16 ah
general 2022-11-08 20:49:13 yes im in school rn

general 2022-11-18 21:32:46 please do not the wall.
general 2022-11-18 21:33:04 ive returned from all my studying
general 2022-11-18 21:33:11 so i can now do discord stuff
general 2022-11-18 21:33:27 btec enterprise
general 2022-11-18 21:38:02 if theres any sfs fans out there, just for the record i finally docked this starship to the endurance
general 2022-11-18 21:40:16 i got a mod specifcally for the endurance so it can travel beyond the solar system.
general 2022-11-18 21:46:24 im back but i got this mod that can basically let you travel beyond and explore other star systems
general 2022-11-18 21:46:34 all of them have a planet or a solar system
general 2022-11-18 21:46:47 yes
general 2022-11-18 21:47:02 trappists at the end has a habital planet, also with the most
general 2022-11-18 21:47:09 let me get a picture
general 2022-11-18 21:47:45 
general 2022-11-18 21:47:49 trappists star
general 2022-11-18 21:48:16 these are all the mods i have
general 2022-11-18 21:48:24 go beyond 5.0 is litteraly
general 2022-11-18 21:48:26 huge
general 2022-11-18 21:48:32 it has andromeda galaxy.
general 2022-11-18 21:48:38 my phone cant even handle it
general 2022-11-18 21:49:57 its a mod, it took awhile to wrap my head around it, but it has had updates
general 2022-11-18 21:50:09 its most recent update is the atlas gemini set
general 2022-11-18 21:50:29 completely free
general 2022-11-18 21:50:34 true and confirmed
general 2022-11-18 21:51:16 i have a video of atmospheric re-entry with my starship
general 2022-11-18 21:51:22 (it didnt land very well)
general 2022-11-18 21:54:38 you will get the mods u just wont have jupiter since the mod assumes u already have it
general 2022-11-18 21:55:25 but personnally, to get around the solar systems, i do use the starships
general 2022-11-18 21:58:32 my favorite crew carried starship
general 2022-11-18 22:10:29 sfs in ohio
general 2022-11-18 22:25:39 thousands of years if we are talking accuarte.
general 2022-11-18 22:26:45 even at the speed of light, a planet 30 light years away would take us 30 years to travel too at the speed of light
general 2022-11-18 22:27:10 the universe is just too big, and the speed of light is just too slow
general 2022-11-18 22:27:42 you can speed up time
general 2022-11-18 22:28:05 maintaining the ship in mods is an option since astroids come youre way in the modded version
general 2022-11-18 22:28:18 speed needs to be around a billion a second.
general 2022-11-19 12:29:54 i made a mars mission station a little sneak peak (solar panels arent really done) anything to improve
general 2022-11-19 12:30:18 oxygen tanks in the back brr
general 2022-11-19 14:14:23 this sign glitch is physically draining.
general 2022-11-19 15:52:48 its almost complete
general 2022-11-19 16:27:13 mars mission station complete
general 2022-11-19 20:44:19 what this is, is the catwalk to heaven
general 2022-11-19 21:01:23 death.
general 2022-11-19 21:01:40 death.
general 2022-11-19 21:02:39 my first instinct was to say white name activity before i even looked
general 2022-11-19 21:23:16 
general 2022-11-19 21:24:06 
general 2022-11-19 21:28:01 when that command module detaches
general 2022-11-19 21:28:42 when you are floating through the vast empty void of space
general 2022-11-19 21:30:18 did a white name just insult a normal person?
general 2022-11-19 21:30:25 bannish him
general 2022-11-19 21:30:29 cast him into the fire
general 2022-11-19 21:30:58 in this world theres 2nd class citizens.
general 2022-11-19 21:32:52 but we are the 2nd class, 1st being inventors since they get special treatment.
general 2022-11-19 21:32:59 but we have 3rd class.
general 2022-11-19 21:33:02 white names.
general 2022-11-20 12:46:50 one way trip to mars
general 2022-11-20 12:50:05 the journey will be begin only to have no end.
general 2022-11-20 12:50:59 you can use the black hole as a gravitational slingshot to get back to the sun and home.
general 2022-11-21 23:45:40 just acouple of space guys huh
general 2022-11-21 23:45:57 that endurance physically hurts.
general 2022-11-21 23:46:56 he took the screenshot, im in the middle right there.
general 2022-11-21 23:47:11 its the station i posted back in october

general 2022-11-22 00:28:57 guys i got the ad.

general 2022-11-23 00:03:29 id kill, for audios.
general 2022-11-23 00:03:34 they so hard to find.
general 2022-11-23 00:04:22 what the.
general 2022-11-23 00:07:25 i need audios for when the engines fire up, not when the takeoff. its really hard to find because of copyright
general 2022-11-23 17:43:57 ohio system
general 2022-11-23 17:45:46 would be nice to have atmopsheric burns
general 2022-11-23 17:46:06 orbit?
general 2022-11-23 17:46:37 well that means the whole map would have to be a loop.
general 2022-11-23 17:46:54 wait thats fucking genius
general 2022-11-23 17:47:07 meet the engineer
general 2022-11-23 17:48:50 fix the light glitch maybe, they turn off randomly.
general 2022-11-23 18:44:42 we undocked from the ISS and now heading for the moon
general 2022-11-23 18:52:49 the moon landing was complete.

general 2022-11-23 23:16:00 <@1004207882784489472> i took the whole thing down and started with the boosters sort of sticking out, the other design felt abit too flat on the bottom half
general 2022-11-23 23:36:34 its coming along
general 2022-11-23 23:36:53 stage 1 for this custom
