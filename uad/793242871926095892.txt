general 2021-11-29 23:56:43 I am a few white triangle vibrating
general 2021-11-29 23:56:57 I am unreasonably distarted
general 2021-11-29 23:57:21 I have been flying for ~10- minuits
general 2021-11-29 23:58:24 The game does not know where i am
general 2021-11-30 00:02:03 after flying off the map at 400k speed for ~12-13 minuits, I am finally invisible
general 2021-12-04 19:11:55 more rocket turrets
general 2021-12-04 19:12:32 or just jets
general 2021-12-04 19:12:37 those work
general 2021-12-04 19:13:28 covering yourself in cutters works 50% of the time
general 2021-12-04 19:14:12 especially against blacklist shredders, covering your self in shredder can give them a bad day
bug-reports 2022-01-15 18:26:48 On hover thrusters they randomly cause the craft tp flip over/jump when nothing is moving under them to cause it. It is like they are interacting with nothing.
