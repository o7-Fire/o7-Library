general 2020-05-17 09:07:18 It’s a vtol
general 2020-05-17 09:07:23 But it can float
general 2020-05-17 09:07:29 But it bugs out
general 2020-05-17 09:07:45 And gets yeeted at 400k sps

general 2020-05-17 09:10:05 I’m trying to make the heli from avatar
general 2020-05-17 09:10:41 But don’t know how to make the wings be able to go forward and back aswell as turn
general 2020-05-17 09:11:01 Like how would I do that
general 2020-05-17 09:11:06 Like double motor
general 2020-05-17 09:12:28 Oh I have oculus quest
general 2020-05-17 09:12:38 Would love the index
general 2020-05-17 09:12:45 But doesn’t sell in Australia
general 2020-05-17 09:13:27 Yes but it can’t be repaired if broken because it’s not supposed to be in Australia
general 2020-05-17 09:14:37 No like if it stops working or something it can’t be repaired I would have to buy a new one
general 2020-05-17 09:14:57 Also my pc isn’t vr ready

help 2020-05-18 02:12:58 Can someone give me a idea on how to do the front of this please thanks
general 2020-05-18 02:55:22 Hey guys can someone explain to me what torque does
general 2020-05-18 03:21:04 Hey guys so motor2 uses your mouse right or the camera
general 2020-05-18 03:22:11 Alright could I possibly make it turn vtol engines one back one forwards
general 2020-05-18 03:22:36 Like the engines on a osprey
general 2020-05-18 03:23:40 Alright would I need to put it on servo mode or no
general 2020-05-18 03:24:50 Alright imma try mouse first then if it doesn’t work I’ll you double servo motor
general 2020-05-18 03:25:34 No like I move my mouse to the right and it turns
general 2020-05-18 03:26:42 I think it does because that was a problem with my hatch
general 2020-05-18 03:26:57 It would break if I moved it to the right or left
general 2020-05-18 03:27:08 And fling me at 400k sps
general 2020-05-18 03:27:33 Yeah I will do that
