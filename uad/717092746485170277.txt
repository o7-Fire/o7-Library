plane-crazy 2021-04-30 19:33:30 mechs are wierd so idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:26:39 magnet
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:26:47 it works like a magnet
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:26:58 you press a button and they either attract or repel
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:29:37 oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:29:46 i have an a380 thats 3888 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:30:13 i recently redid the interior and livery
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:30:24 it was a singapore then i made it into qantas
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:30:30 the interior is now so nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:30:55 it now has a bar at the back on the seccond floor
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:31:03 and i redid all the cabins
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:33:08 noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:33:15 i have no ground vehicles currently
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:33:20 i have 1 boat and alot of planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 20:33:27 and 3 helicopters
general 2021-04-30 20:54:57 *insert cyberpunk meme*
general 2021-04-30 20:56:32 yes
general 2021-04-30 20:56:35 99 percent
general 2021-04-30 20:56:44 some people that have them use them to kill other shreaders
general 2021-04-30 20:56:51 like myself
general 2021-04-30 20:57:01 i only use my shreader against other shreaders and annoying spawn killers
general 2021-04-30 20:58:51 run while you still can
general 2021-04-30 20:59:27 i think that blacklisting in pvp should mean that cutters cant damage ur builds
general 2021-04-30 20:59:41 because rn blacklisting shreaders makes them worse
general 2021-04-30 21:00:13 just fight fire with fire
general 2021-04-30 21:00:19 ?
general 2021-04-30 21:00:44 not all shreader users are bad
general 2021-04-30 21:01:00 the shreader itself just shouldnt be allowed to function
general 2021-04-30 21:02:04 spawn killers
general 2021-04-30 21:02:19 yes
general 2021-04-30 21:02:28 i dont think that shreader users should be banned
general 2021-04-30 21:02:43 i think that they should change the way they work so all shreaders just break
general 2021-04-30 21:03:37 all my planes are too realistic to stand a chance
bot-central 2021-04-30 21:06:17 !rank
general 2021-04-30 21:06:34 this conversation has pretty much died
general 2021-04-30 21:07:02 yes
general 2021-04-30 21:07:19 i just think they should change the way cutters work
general 2021-04-30 21:07:35 so then sheaders become useless
general 2021-04-30 21:07:59 tbh its more like 70%
creations-chat 2021-04-30 21:09:23 <@!546223347025969164> i looked at that and when i saw it i kid you not fortunate son started playing on my playlist.
general 2021-04-30 21:09:57 ?
general 2021-04-30 21:11:00 ???
general 2021-04-30 21:11:02 how?
general 2021-04-30 21:11:34 did you say no no words in the christian roblox server?
bot-central 2021-04-30 21:12:44 !rank
general 2021-04-30 21:14:49 why is everyone so judgy in <#384025409945337856>
general 2021-05-01 11:10:03 Why does everyone downvote something because it is small?
general 2021-05-01 11:10:32 OK I guess so
general 2021-05-01 11:10:44 But the mini tank rn has detail
general 2021-05-01 11:11:01 For its size it looks so good
general 2021-05-01 11:11:40 Anyways
general 2021-05-01 11:11:43 Quick question
general 2021-05-01 11:12:20 In <#609442446249820211>  it says for aeronautical engineer it has to have yaw and it can't use engines to pitch
general 2021-05-01 11:12:35 By yaw does it mean it has to have a rudder?
general 2021-05-01 11:13:09 And also with engines lifting it is it ok of the engines are there to keep it stable/ almost like trim
general 2021-05-01 11:14:07 I have rockets at the front of all my big airliners, they can all fly off  just the tail but they don't climb well
general 2021-05-01 11:14:28 So thats why I have rockets at the front too keep it level
general 2021-05-01 11:15:26 I cant
general 2021-05-01 11:15:30 Back has no space
general 2021-05-01 11:15:42 Its filled with rockets that actualy make the thing move
general 2021-05-01 11:16:34 Doesn't fly right then
general 2021-05-01 11:16:39 It just flops
general 2021-05-01 11:16:45 Into its back
general 2021-05-01 11:16:57 My planes need an absurd amount of rockets to fly
general 2021-05-01 11:17:21 No
general 2021-05-01 11:17:25 I don't use motor lock
general 2021-05-01 11:17:32 Just not my style of building
general 2021-05-01 11:17:43 I've only used motor lock on 4 aircraft
general 2021-05-01 11:18:02 My c17, a350, v22 and dc10 all for the nose
general 2021-05-01 11:18:41 I just don't think its for me
general 2021-05-01 11:18:49 I've been playing the game for a year now
general 2021-05-01 11:19:29 Motor lock just isn't for me
general 2021-05-01 11:19:33 Since I build airliners
general 2021-05-01 11:19:39 I have no space to do motor lock
general 2021-05-01 11:20:14 I might either submit my a350, a380 or 757 for the aeronautical engineer role
general 2021-05-01 11:20:28 The a350 is the latest and has lots of blocks
general 2021-05-01 11:20:51 The a380 is fully completed with a nice livery and has enough blocks for rank 5
general 2021-05-01 11:21:11 And my 757 doesn't have enough blocks for rank 5 but has the best livery and also working flaps
general 2021-05-01 11:21:50 I don't hate them but I just try to keep them to a minimum
general 2021-05-01 11:22:09 I do use it occasionally on stuff but never multi layer stuff
general 2021-05-01 11:23:26 Imma attemp to build an xb70 now
general 2021-05-01 11:24:59 Lol

general 2021-05-01 17:15:11 :(
general 2021-05-01 17:16:43 What is this conversation?
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:19:11 I've literally today used cutters on one of my builds that isn't actualy there to destroy anything for the first time
bug-reports 2021-05-01 17:21:11 That's nothing
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:21:49 Build everything you can and find what you are best at
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:25:28 Might wanna start off small, one common mistake that everyone makes when first joining the game is building something that is too big for them to handle
help 2021-05-01 17:25:51 Looks nice
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:27:53 ... didnt see that there, I sadly still havnt gotten a reply for my rank request  hoping for expert aeronautical  master (v)
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:30:32 Let's take this to <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:32:01 Mig 21 is a pencil with an engine and a pilot straped to it
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:32:34 Surprisingly I've never seen anyone build an xb-70 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:32:55 Which is why I decided to take up the task and build that monster of a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:33:17 Its looking good so far imma start on the second section in a bit
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:34:38 Yellow
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:34:46 Holy
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:34:51 OK I can't beat that
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:35:16 Yh but I always keep my builds at a realistic size
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:35:31 I always do them as if the roblox character where the size of a fully grown man
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:36:49 The fact that the wings fold rlly helps with when they get too wide for the build area
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:37:47 What chaos is going on in that chat?
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:39:23 Yellow  the mig 21 cockpit is rlly far back
creations-chat 2021-05-01 17:41:24 I was thinking of wrong plane, oops
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:56:30 Please burn that
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:57:09 Good
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:57:44 Tail looks too short
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:58:20 Looks too smol
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:58:45 Turn the top right wedge into a 1 by 2
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:58:50 Them extend the back
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 17:59:35 Turn the 1 by 2 wedge o  top right into a wedge and a 1 by 2 wedge facing up i mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:42:45 its finaly done
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:43:00 ive finished the xb-70
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:43:17 it literaly takes like an hour
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:48:52 because 5 year old must asert dominance on anything within a 1 mile radius of it
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:50:03 yh
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 20:50:38 5 year old logic:
"must burn all potato pc's including my dads laptop"
creations-chat 2021-05-01 21:29:26 Why do people not like my xb-70, is there anything I could do to make it better?
general 2021-05-01 21:30:22 Galaxy is better and everyone knows it
general 2021-05-01 21:31:18 Galaxy deserves more attention
general 2021-05-01 21:31:23 Its had so many updates
general 2021-05-01 21:31:43 And all of the ships are so detailed
general 2021-05-01 21:32:38 No...
general 2021-05-01 21:32:50 Get enough to make a freighter then loot stuff
general 2021-05-01 21:33:02 It makes money and materials so fast
general 2021-05-01 21:33:13 Well yh
general 2021-05-01 21:33:22 Thats why you loot a destroyed starbase
general 2021-05-01 21:33:32 Or alien ships in ur terratory
general 2021-05-01 21:33:47 Or any ship in unclaimed space
general 2021-05-01 21:34:12 I don't use  big ships anymore
general 2021-05-01 21:34:20 The small ships are alot of fun
general 2021-05-01 21:34:55 I wish they redid the gryphon because rn its one of the last broken ones but its also my favorite in the game
creations-chat 2021-05-01 21:35:28 But the plane is white irl? Always has been, plus there's only 1 left in existence that isn't a pile of scrap so not much to go off for liveries
general 2021-05-01 21:37:47 Because yes
general 2021-05-01 21:38:12 Who remembers all the old, good games that are now dead

creations-chat 2021-05-01 22:11:13 Bit hard to adjust the angle while flying, its very sensative when at high speed
general 2021-05-01 22:16:21 I heard somebody say that the game was trash because their plane didn't work
general 2021-05-01 22:17:43 Most noobs ignore the totorial, build something huge, them complain that it doesn't fly itself
general 2021-05-02 06:54:17 Wdym?

creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:24:04 so like little bits of rust or seewead thats caught onto the ship?
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:30:34 ive changed some of the bottom to sand so the paint looks a bit rubbed off in some places but i dont know what to do for above the red

creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:53:13 its just overdone, too much on it especialy the livery, too much to look at
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:55:18 not impressed, i literaly cant even tell what plane it is, plus that tail is way too short
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:57:25 also why did zach dislike the enormous space station that looks rlly good?
creations-chat 2021-05-13 17:00:22 thats the one thing i dislike about the people that have realy high standards for builds, in my case if it looks like what is is supposed to be with accurate size and livery  and does its function then its an upvote.
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:22:27 Too blocky
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:22:44 Make the nose more round
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:22:51 The 727 has a 737 like nose
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:23:21 And try to make it 7 blocks wide on interior for the realistic 3-3 configuration
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:23:44 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:24:06 Looks better
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:24:16 Put half ball on the nose
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:25:00 That looks alot better
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:25:55 Should  I make a bac-1,11 or a hs 121 trident?
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:28:16 111 is a 2-3 config and 121 is a 3-3 config
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:45:19 what should i make?
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:46:27 bac 111 or hs 121
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:47:20 imma make a bac 111
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 19:14:05 Probably because the design of the plane can't handle going that fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 19:15:35 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 19:15:49 My fastest aircraft goes 650 speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 19:16:09 Except it isn't custom and that's how fast its meant to go so it can handle probably going 1k speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 19:20:10 Probably lag

help 2021-05-22 21:46:59 And I cant to half block wings otherwise it blocks some other motor locking
help 2021-05-22 21:47:25 The wing sticks out a bit before the folding wing starts so I cant hide it anywhere
help 2021-05-22 21:47:54 I've just come off
help 2021-05-22 21:48:12 I could make the main wing that the motor sits on a half block
help 2021-05-22 21:48:18 Then have it in there
help 2021-05-22 21:48:28 That might work
help 2021-05-22 21:51:57 I literally just came off

creations-chat 2021-05-25 21:51:08 Tip: don't use motor lock on airliners that are big, even with the nose you will struggle to do the folding, I found out the hard way when building my a359 realising that it was going to be rlly close gap between the motor locking and the tail

creations-chat 2021-06-29 06:59:04 It's just that time of the day I guess
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:01:07 All the shitty builds get upvoted to hell in the morning and later everything good or bad gets downvoted
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:14:56 Tbh when you spend a week making anything you realy can't be bothered to add tiny little weathering details
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:17:13 Anyways my hard worked leander frigate got downvoted to hell because it didn't have weathering
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:19:15 I've just stopped posting my builds in the server, cause they will most likely get downvoted, might post my a330 soon tho
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:21:17 Dolphin guy
creations-chat 2021-06-29 07:23:21 But anyways I think its upvoted because it is an original build, you don't see a dolphin every day in <#384025409945337856> but you do see a million su-33's and f-4 phantoms
plane-crazy 2021-07-04 08:30:17 if you count the amount of aircraft indonesia has an incredibly small air force
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:10:02 any suggestions for a cold war bomber i could make?(preferably british), b47 is the only cold war bomber i have
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:15:54 imma make an avro vulcan b1, would that be a good idea, (the b1 is the one with the triangle wing that likes to disintegrate)

plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:38:43 
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:44:50 just move it a block in any direction and move it back
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:45:01 that always fixes it
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:49:50 ok yh but the nose and the tail angles are impossable to reach, everything else i agree with
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:50:13 if only they released a wedge 1 by8 or 1 by 7
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:50:52 eh i like building the traditional way
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:51:07 all my builds now involve some sort of motor lock but only to make a cockpit shape
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:54:24 ok thanks for feedback, i think ill stick to just posting my airliners, they seem to be the only thing people like
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:55:47 ill make 1 more test to see if i am realy that bad at jets
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 19:55:55 if it gets downvoted to hell then i wont post them anymore
creations-chat 2021-07-05 20:01:50 ok yh my experiment is complete, dont post anything at this time of day, this time of the day is the toxic time
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:35:36 Make a mirage
creations-chat 2021-07-06 18:22:16 I do agree tho that having hars breathing down your neck for having it 1 inch short or a tiny error is annoying
creations-chat 2021-07-06 18:32:53 I was not realy referring to that but ok...
creations-chat 2021-07-08 21:18:50 Elevators are impossible they are like a 1.5 wedge, almost like the nose of literally every embraer aircraft
creations-chat 2021-07-08 21:22:35 Yh I know the pain, I've tried to make so many embraers before but the nose angle is just pain
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:45:10 Whenever sombody posts something good everyone rushes to make their own version of it
creations-chat 2021-07-11 07:48:11 Don't delete it, its still good enough to be there and its not like they posted a block and called it a wip
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:29:17 Rip, that's a hard choice, btw I would make the whole thing bigger so there is more room for motor locking but I don't think you can really go back now so good luck with that
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:37:34 <@613848845960347681> that a320 needs a better livery, you have gotten the easy jet livery but it is backwards and upside-down and unless its the europcar livery it doesn't have green on it
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:40:56 Try to make it look more like an a319 because then you have an easier livery to do and that thing looks like an a319, only problem is that the a319 neo isn't in service yet so it will need to be a regular a319 if you wanna change it.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:08:44 Def an unde
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:11:20 Its not all toxic, we just don't like ur builds that you have put no effort into plus ur pfp is among us so most people here automatically don't like you
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:13:25 Tiny bit too far but eh, its a child so its ok
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:15:27 Child does not deserve sympathy
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:19:02 Same, anything from ages 6-10 scare me when in big groups because they are like little creatures, they will slowly eat you if you are not careful, anything below 6 you can just kick easily, you can get them a few meters with a good kick
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:21:57 Sadly I don't live in America which is also good since america is a bit of a s hole at the moment, ill just kick them, it's more fun
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:24:01 Eh I like the uk it's more fun because then you can walk around literally any corner and there is a pub you can hide in before the horde of kids arrive

creations-chat 2021-07-21 10:19:07 I will now start downvoting every f15 that comes into <#384025409945337856> because they are all one block wide and it annoys me because all that exposed motor lock and the characters arms sticking out of the sides
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:09:49 Mm yes another argument about how toxic the community is
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:13:28 Don't go there...

Because no

Gud
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:16:15 Thats why making airliners is a very profitable business, because nobody ever builds them because these dam overated fighter jets...
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:18:25 All these kids making their f15's and su-30's never think to make a nice airbus a330-300 or boeing 737-200, airliners are always better
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:21:07 No but what I'm saying is that <#384025409945337856> always gets filled with the same stuff and thats why you get downvoted to hell for posting a good build at a bad time
creations-chat 2021-07-22 14:25:55 Anyways don't post when its late, around 6-10pm gmt is when toxicity happens and everything is downvoted
creations-chat 2021-07-22 16:31:58 Looks very good so far, that nose shape and cockpit shape are rlly good, good luck making the rest of it
creations-chat 2021-07-23 14:43:32 Yay another pointless argument because of some build that people don't like
creations-chat 2021-07-23 14:55:13 Everything

help 2021-07-26 13:07:47 should i sacrifice the beautiful nose of my an 124 to put 2 motors in to make the nose open up?
creations-chat 2021-07-26 13:44:59 got my antonov an-124, what livery should i put on it?

also should i make the nose open but then it would have 2 random motors on the nose?
creations-chat 2021-07-26 13:47:35 i wasnt asking for feedback, just wanted to know what people want on it
creations-chat 2021-07-26 14:10:06 nose now opens but its got the ugly motors sticking out of it, the ramp also fully folds out and goes in and the front gear does bend down for the ramp
help 2021-07-26 15:01:12 well it does probably have weight, just a very small amount
help 2021-07-26 15:01:22 if it didnt have weight then it would just float off
creations-chat 2021-07-26 15:08:01 it now is almost complete, got a soviet union livery on it and engines are now done, just need to paint the wings and it will be finished :)
creations-chat 2021-07-26 15:10:03 not much other colour i can do them, all the an124 photos of the engines have black engine fans in them so i dont know what other colour to do
creations-chat 2021-07-26 15:13:15 I've got different colour background to make them stand out

the-dump 2021-07-26 18:17:16 Well the German flag in ww2 wasn't officialy that ,it was just the symbol of the political party

the-dump 2021-07-26 18:18:02 Well no
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:18:13 The main German flag was the German empire flag
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:21:57 So if a person posts a picture on the Hindenburg it wouldn't be allowed because it has no no symbols on the back?
the-dump 2021-07-26 18:23:18 Bit sus
creations-chat 2021-07-27 22:24:00 Its not too long, have you seen the ship its based off, its an absolute sosig boat, the only thing is that the nose front is a tiny bit too long, other than that it looks fine
creations-chat 2021-07-27 22:26:09 See... sosig boat, everyone so quick to judge just because it doesn't look right, the problem with the community is that people think they know everything when they don't
creations-chat 2021-07-27 22:28:11 Just a tiny bit, you said "its way too fucking long" which is an overreaction considering its quite a good size just the front is a bit long
creations-chat 2021-07-27 22:31:32 Everything behind the rear looks fine, if they wanna extent the landing pad so small helicopters can actualy land on it then its fine
creations-chat 2021-07-28 22:27:33 Use the round cylinder wedge in thing on the cockpit if its an a350, if its a 787 then it looks fine, i assume its an a350 due to the black cockpit
creations-chat 2021-07-28 22:30:47 Ok gud but yh instead of using a  half wedge where the cockpit bends up to the top use a round wedge in thing so it is more rounded and looks nicer
creations-chat 2021-07-29 12:36:44 I shall attempt to make a slinky later
creations-chat 2021-07-29 12:43:13 But the springs can't bend
creations-chat 2021-07-29 16:08:07 Same thing just with a probe poking out the back
creations-chat 2021-07-29 16:10:10 Some are cargo aircraft, c-130 can do refueling but the main aerial refueling aircraft are the kc-135 (boeing 707), kc10 (md-10) and various military cargo aircraft
creations-chat 2021-07-29 16:12:37 Also there needs to be more b52's being made, nobody makes them, they are very underrated in this server, there are only 30 in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-07-30 21:33:07 If you want proper trim just attach some wing panels to a very slow motor on ur wings or if you are lazy just put rockets in the nose of ur plane, tip: make a custom control surface and don't use the ones in the game.
creations-chat 2021-07-30 21:35:22 I think your rocket it very cool and deserves more upvotes, I like the fact that it has the smallest package inside, definitely not polluting the planet or anything<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-07-30 21:37:53 Jeff bezos is proud of you
creations-chat 2021-07-30 21:42:35 I guess the 4 boosters could be closer as being 1 block apart connected by 2 small blocks would be a little unrealistic, unless they were made out of something strong they would be ripped off on take off

help 2021-08-08 09:44:28 i will add those when the main exterior is done
help 2021-08-08 09:49:57 im already including tanks into the build by having tank turrets spread around the place to add onto the apocalyptic vibe
help 2021-08-08 09:52:17 i think ill just keep it simple for now
help 2021-08-08 09:53:21 there will be 3 engines at the back of different sizes and maybe some on the bottom
help 2021-08-08 10:05:16 ok
help 2021-08-08 10:05:50 i think ill put those on the sides since this thing will also act as a boat aswell as a space ship

help 2021-08-08 10:56:49 ok
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:53:08 How did that b24 get so many downvotes, it looks rlly good, tbh I guess this is the most toxic time of the day
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:55:17 There is no need to take it out of hand, either you get offended very easily or you are trying to start an unnecessary argument
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:57:50 In no way is an argument necessary, it just fills up the channel with useless things and defeats the purpose of this channel, he said 2 words that you seem to be getting so upset about, I advise that you just ignore it
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:00:16 I do agree with this but you cant rlly do anything about it, all I know is that if you post at certain times in the day the server can be more forgiving and fair, also hall of fame is there to be the good builds separated from the other builds
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:03:09 Also that would probably count as harassment so you probably don't wanna do that
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:05:41 Yh sorry but there's not much feedback we can give if we don't even know what it is supposed to be, also you cant improve something so simple
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:08:04 Guys try not to be too mean, just give some feedback, tbh you probably should practice at building planes, its just too small and simple and if you post it here you know the toxicity is coming
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:10:48 No real need for that, just a bit off topic, just try to be helpful in this channel instead of just being mean to people (vv he was talking about his plane)
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:13:13 Its a c172, you can tell by its  thickness, the 152 is akot thinner and the 152 doesn't usually have tinted windows
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:15:15 Can you please stop with the toxicity, the conversation is pretty much over and there is no need to keep it going, feedback was given on the aircraft and that is that
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:19:13 Tbh im not trying to minimod, I just wanna improve the server and this channel, everything you see here is just toxicity and arguments, there is no real use of this channel, no real feedback is ever given, maybe there will one day be a pic without toxicity, probably not but you never know if you don't try, honestly I don't care if you break any rules, I just wanna stop the toxicity
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:22:05 Although it does get used as a hub of toxicity on this server and people just having arguments over unecessary things
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:24:30 Yet it all happens because people in this channel exaggerate how bad their build is without giving any other feedback other than "delete it" or "it is trash".
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:26:45 Yet nobody is helpful when that happens, its always the same, nobody ever attempts to be nice to them or help them improve it
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:28:57 See that is a nice build, although most people would just call it bad due to its small size
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:31:17 The little nyan cat that got downvoted to hell

Its actualy quite a nice little build, maybe some more photo angles could be used but it still looks like nyan cat
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:34:32 Also alot of the mini tanks get alot of downvotes even though they look good, the little innovation ship looks good its got alot of the details on it
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:38:39 Its just a general thing, look up mini tanks in creations and you will find a few that look good yet have alot of downvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:41:44 There is a mini Italian tank there that is good, most of the time mini builds in general get downvoted for their size.
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:43:49 I'm on mobile so its annoying to copy images and things


<@479298992874979328>  that is actualy a good build, considering the size and the fact that there is motorlock hidden in that tiny thing makes it a good build
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:47:34 Ok I go sleep now, goodnight random internet peoples
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:51:12 I chose a bad area of toxicity that is hard to explain and find examples, you win argument, ok now goodnight
creations-chat 2021-08-09 21:54:15 Weathering isn't needed on aircraft unless ur making a specific aircraft that always appears dirty, aircraft are mostly kept quite clean and you rarely see very dirty aircraft
creations-chat 2021-08-09 21:57:12 I don't know how they manage to screw up a heart tbh, it isn't shaped like a heart and it is very lazy, maybe if it were done proper it would not be considered low effort
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:00:03 Yh that just ruins it, it actualy annoys me that they have done that
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:08:11 I kinda wanna make a boot that can crush the spider, it would look satisfying to see a big ol boot crush that thing
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:12:49 <@679152777276162060> that a320 looks alot like an a350, it looks to long and the winglets are too rounded which adds to the a350 vibe, also with that lufthansa livery there is a grey bottom and a very dark tail which looks like the new and old livery mixed, tail needs to be a bit brighter for old lufthansa livery
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:19:01 Well I mean anything can eat shit if they wanted to(or not...), especially most ryanairs tend to eat shit when they land
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:23:31 Quality of photos is fine, nice boat btw
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:02:59 I has this the other day when I was building a new 737 max and this kid with his peice of shit plane said don't copy, it looked nothing like his aircraft thing and nobody would want to copy whatever that demonic thing was
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:05:29 True, then people with half built things would get their progress deleted, if only there were more blacklist things like in pvp cutter and guns cant damage ur build to stop shreaders
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:07:39 Yh there does need to be more moderation, it is stupid how much they let people do this stuff
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:10:17 yes, nearly every game now has a mod call system where mods can come and fix issues
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:12:34 i used a hover engine to speed away from this annoying person and they went mental at me for using a "glitch engine" just saying that it ruins the game and glitch engines are against the rules, it was funny af
creations-chat 2021-08-10 09:15:11 tbh they cant add a votekick system, it would ruin the game and it would be better with more moderation
creations-chat 2021-08-10 10:33:52 Im tryna get expert designer by making a big building with full interior, I don't know if it will work tho, would a building be good for upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:54:28 my half done building, anything i can improve on?
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:56:31 i dont have any reference images sadly, its supposed to be a connected building so the sides are just going to be left flat and i dont know where i could add pillars, nvm ive added pillars
creations-chat 2021-08-11 10:02:24 bae hawk t1
creations-chat 2021-08-11 10:23:56 that guy was completely random, i went into pvp just after finishing the build and the dude had the an 225, i couldnt resist
creations-chat 2021-08-11 10:27:48 i was testing its strength and the guy was there just placing tnt and blowing his an 225 up, i always test my builds in pvp after i finish them,
creations-chat 2021-08-11 13:09:57 :), thank you
creations-chat 2021-08-11 13:13:33 Antonov an-12 I assume, an an 26 crashed the other day, an 26 is like the an 12  just with 2 engines

creations-chat 2021-08-11 18:02:39 The 500lb platybomb
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:53:16 <@441125486312030221> nice 777, very detailed and accurate, maybe try painting qatar onto the side so the livery is complete, the tail looks rlly good but the main fuselage is a bit plain
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:55:27 My first build was a rocket that I made out of 1x0.9 blocks like an idiot and it fell apart immediately
creations-chat 2021-08-12 08:57:56 If the fuselage has 1x2 wedges on it you could try separating them into half wedges and it makes it alot easier to put text on it
creations-chat 2021-08-12 11:53:32 Mig 21 overated, its a pencil with a rocket on the end that has a person on it
creations-chat 2021-08-13 08:05:32 hot

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:29:42 I want something that actualy flew
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:29:59 Non supersonic

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:31:58 Others?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:32:15 I cant decide between 707, 737 or dc-8
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:32:42 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:32:49 No tri jets
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:33:55 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:34:13 Constelation too wierd
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:34:45 No rapide

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:34:56 No props
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:38:56 No supersonic
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:39:41 I'm deciding between 707 or 737
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:39:48 Maybe 747-100
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:39:50 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:41:06 Nah

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:44:18 There are pretty much no 747's in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:40:35 Shreader or turret?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:42:07 Spawn a build so big and laggy that they can't resist destroying it, when they do their game will crash because they have potato pc
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:42:42 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 10:13:55 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 10:14:04 Helium is friend
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 10:15:22 I made a heli but it uses all sorts of rockets and helium to keep it stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 10:16:43 Don't use helicopters to raise a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 10:16:55 That is a recipe for disaster

help 2021-08-28 22:32:35 It might be the fact that it is touching the thing and breaking the build

creations-chat 2021-09-18 20:17:39 ive only made one thing that is in a mustard vid and its the do-31, its still my most stable and best vtol aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 10:35:10 i found the ultimate cheese grater
creations-chat 2021-09-19 19:00:25 has anyone ever lined up the entire 7x7 series in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:55:10 <#504436696021204992>  in a nutshell ^^
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:58:02 I am on their side here tbh, they are just talking and there was no need for you to interrupt
creations-chat 2021-09-20 19:00:28 This is creations feedback he is allowed to talk about his creation
creations-chat 2021-09-20 19:04:06 Agreed, whenever a big YouTube posts a video on something it will be just spammed in <#384025409945337856> , it can just be repetitive and annoying tbh
creations-chat 2021-09-20 19:07:43 There are alot more people out there that can do what mustard does but in more detail, its the fact that he does it more simple so people understand it
creations-chat 2021-09-20 19:11:29 The only way I get inspiration to build stuff is when I go to museums or airports and actualy see them
creations-chat 2021-09-20 19:13:47 Ye, they always try to build off memory which never works or the vid they are watching, I use pics off Google because you can get loads of angles and accuracy
creations-chat 2021-09-22 21:47:08 Plane looks like a b-25
creations-chat 2021-09-23 18:18:47 <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-09-23 20:47:48 <@529716042113744906>  engines are way too close to the fuselage on that a320, vertical stabiliser is very short and so are the elevators, other than that it ain't that bad
creations-chat 2021-09-23 21:29:13 How dare people downvote Perry the 500 pound platabomb
creations-chat 2021-09-23 21:31:20 It still has the platabomb tho so I still upvote

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:50:10 Btw fun fact, use explosives as flares so you can use them as bombs and drop them on other planes

creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:36:14 Still just build the memorial not the bloody whole thing, it isn't even that detailed
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:38:16 Even from a distance they are not supposed to be solid bricks
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:40:16 Its still pretty stupid, build the memorial not the actual thing and actualy make it good cause if you don't it shows that you don't care and probably just going for free upvotes
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:43:55 Then if you build the tower make it accurate and detailed so it shows that you aren't some scumbag that doesn't care and is just trying to get free upvotes
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:50:59 I suggest you just delete that and escape while you still have no dignity
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:55:03 Its disrespectful because its obvious that you don't have the respect to put in the time and effort to show that you care and it shows that all you want is some green bloody arrows
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:08:55 No... just executing a disrespectful person that is trying to farm upvotes
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:12:02 I wouldn't make a bloody "memorial" that looks like actual bs

creations-chat 2022-01-03 23:13:04 Move the wing out one, have the motor lock get motor locked by more motor lock into the fuselage, complicated but it works
creations-chat 2022-01-09 17:15:27 A sword or knife that comes out its arm/ wrist, would be cool ngl or maybe a rocket that comes out

events-chat 2022-01-30 09:12:53 should i make the largest fighter jet ever built?
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:13:23 hehe
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:13:40 i could easily make my comet into a nimrod
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:32:13 yes
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:37:56 no
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:38:16 it goes spin spin so it helicoper
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:40:19 my thing is just small and annoying so i think i got good odds here
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:42:43 tbh they might change to 350
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:00 my 318 block plane struggles at 300
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:21 its rlly slow
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:38 theres no fun cause nobody can maneuver to avoid things
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:43:55 well planes are built for fast paced fighting
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:44:16 400 is a reasonable speed
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:45:11 well 0.0000002 seconds is about how much time you get irl
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:45:48 i mean modern dogfights and it all changes depending on where that aircraft is
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:46:42 400 is a speed where you can do wierd things to avoid people while also not having it at the point where nobody can hit each other
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:47:00 isnt that simple
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:47:38 and you definetly have a plane that is probably too small for the event
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:49:28 intense = enjoyable
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:50:13 300 is still to slow
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:50:30 atleast 350-400
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:51:38 i can easily fly a plane at 300
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:52:59 i said it can fly, not that it can maneuver
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:54:53 i fly a very maneuverable aircraft , it just stalls at 300 whenever i do a sharp turn
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:56:43 is that all?
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:57:55 something that helps
events-chat 2022-01-30 09:58:11 maybe a helpful tip of how to get a plane flying better at low speeds
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:07:45 super rocket engines are banned
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:08:15 and my build has literaly no space so the hover engines are the only ones that fit
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:08:50 it doesnt say anything about glitch engines
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:09:08 afk brb
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:16:23 oof
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:16:39 my plane cannot fly with rockets :(
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:21:12 are you guys sure hover engines are not allowed?
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:21:34 if they were banned surely then hover engines would be in banned blocks along with regular pistons
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:22:05 ye i need a hover drive to fly
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:22:21 my plane is too small to get rockets in
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:22:38 i dont wanna motor lock so i can keep blocks down
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:22:54 more blocks = heavier
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:23:28 the speed limit is too low for alot of blocks
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:23:49 wide wingspan
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:24:08 anyways im sure that hover drives are not banned
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:24:45 why did they not put them in banned blocks?
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:25:02 they put every other thing in banned blocks except for pistons and hover engines
events-chat 2022-01-30 10:32:45 yes i know that
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:08:51 hover engines are not banned
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:12:29 they said no glitches, not no glitch engines
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:12:50 glitch engines probably meaning, no super fast things
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:14:13 ok so hover engine may count as a glitch engine but it doesnt make ur plane go supersonic speeds
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:14:43 you can control the speed is what i am saying
events-chat 2022-01-30 11:57:22 <:pain:644301805534183464>

events-chat 2022-01-30 12:00:58 ok stalling on corners is no longer an issue
events-chat 2022-01-30 12:02:10 wasnt the engines, im going slower than before, just made my control surfaces go further

the-dump 2022-02-24 14:13:55 I think there's a reason then do that
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:14:31 You don't rlly want a person who can barely see behind the controls of an aircraft worth millions
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:15:20 Not rlly
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:15:55 Flying commercial planes requires good eyesight due to the fact that you don't want to hit other people
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:17:21 Atc can get things wrong and I don't think panels can see everything
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:17:29 For example birds
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:18:12 If you see them from far enough away
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:18:51 Still happens
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:19:23 Birds can do major damage in the right places
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:19:39 Not realy
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:19:47 You can see planes from miles away
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:19:54 No matter the size
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:20:50 Its quite obvious
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:20:57 You don't even have to be looking for them
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:21:27 Well no
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:21:45 Eyesight can also affect what you see in the cockpit
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:22:18 You gotta remember
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:22:27 You have to be looking at alot of things at the same time
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:23:05 If your landing and you mistake the airspeed it could lead to a stall and crash
the-dump 2022-02-24 14:24:33 I'm talking like blurry in one eye or something

creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:08:49 Very nice but you could try adding something that makes it look a bit less f35
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:43:42 Adding onto my precious statement add something that makes it stand out, like a defining feature that it obvious in the design as currently it looks like a very standard design, examples being an intake in a different place, perhaps some sort or mini winglet, an odd feature that just defines the aircraft
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:50:39 A pylon on the spine would be a very cool feature

creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:19:03 Well don't just post it with shaders, post photos without shaders and I will upvote, having it just with shaders is making it look better than it is
creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:21:08 What does british have to do with this?
creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:23:12 You have not given an accurate example of the build, I cannot see the real build if it is covered by shaders

<@401530469952389130>  what does that even mean?
creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:25:17 Also you have 124 upvotes and your mad about 1 downvote
creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:29:10 Well don't show it as what few people see and more of what the average person playing the game without shaders sees, all im saying is if you are going to use shaders then atleast don't just post 1 photo and post multiple photos showing different angles with and without shaders.

Now can we please end this and focus on the idiot saying a continent is dumb?
creations-chat 2022-08-14 21:31:22 It's very far from the one without shaders then
