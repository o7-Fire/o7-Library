general 2020-03-17 20:16:44 good luck mate
bug-reports 2020-03-17 20:17:21 yeah, it happened a few times to me too, but i'm a little fuzzy on the details and the recreation.
help 2020-03-17 20:33:51 <@!495186126055931904> max torque dictates how much force the motor can apply, for example, you want to push something. A high torque low speed motor can get it done, but a high speed low torque motor, however, cannot.
help 2020-03-17 20:34:04 it's just a measure of how powerful, not fast, your motor is.
help 2020-03-17 20:34:23 i'd leave it at max

creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:39:46 i made a hydrofoil
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:40:17 it's unstable and kinda weird tho
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:40:46 uhh
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:40:49 wing below water
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:41:30 it doesn't have the same fluid dynamics as the real thing, and there's no computer system to correct the pitch of the foils, so you have to manually correct the pitch to make it stay above water
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:41:46 it's a lot of multitasking
creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:41:59 especially if you want to drive it and keep steady

creations-chat 2020-03-22 22:48:15 cause the hull-building process is a watch-and-learn thing
creations-chat 2020-03-22 23:04:53 mate
creations-chat 2020-03-22 23:05:01 that's not really a hydrofoil

plane-crazy 2020-03-26 00:43:30 the CoM bubble still doesn't shift though
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 00:44:13 well it's because of the block itself, not its density
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 00:44:37 plus, it just makes lifting the plane that much harder
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 00:44:41 it's a VTOL

creations-chat 2020-03-26 01:36:31 lol
creations-chat 2020-03-26 03:01:44 this looks really unimpressive, but it's a cool idea i came up with. This kinda serves as my test bed for the active aero system. It tilts the wing to exert a turning force on the wheels.
creations-chat 2020-03-26 03:02:03 it looks really unimpressive, i know.
creations-chat 2020-03-26 03:04:41 it does

general 2020-05-07 00:04:57 lmao
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:07:35 yeah, i think it's the same thing that happens when you use custom wheels
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:07:51 if you have the motor 2 rotations speed up too high
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:07:55 it spazzes out
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:03 yea def
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:06 set it to like 1
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:14 no
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:22 it's not gonna help
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:36 just set it to 1 and leave it otherwise it spazzes out
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:47 motor speed 50 custom wheels are spazzy
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:08:54 like.. really spazzy
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:09:10 if setting it to 1 doesn't work then it's probably a bug
bug-reports 2020-05-07 00:22:53 yea

creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:09:33 im not a big history nerd, and im pretty terrible at this game, first wip build in a while, input?
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:37:01 <@!655236433501618180> it's an me163, some german aircraft that used a rocket engine
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:41:39 look im not a history nerd <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145> my numbers are great, it's a 263
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:44:38 yeah im oversimplifying the slope, just gonna edge the rear down, im not rebuilding the whole thing to be 4x4 <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:46:55 yeah this's how it looks rn
creations-chat 2020-11-10 20:49:02 im gonna redo the wings with motor lock rn, motors aren't gonna be hidden but whatever, i'll just hide it on the belly of the plane
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:43:41 <@!774122294179135519> yeah everyone here's a jerk unless you're a god at building or build something that remotely looks like something historical and call it historical
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:45:22 well, he isn't wrong, but it's demoralizing to see 500 downvotes on your creation just because you posted a wip build, im only terrain / vtol I because i don't finish a lot of my creations, and i'm just burned out of the community that just shits on newer players just because they're newer to a block building game
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:47:34 maybe provide tips on how to improve or give constructive criticism instead of just saying "haha build sucks, downvoted" and just leaving
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:49:06 how easy is just pinging them and telling them to experiment with corner wedges and corner wedgeblocks? what can they do better on in their next build? seriously, if they're posting here, it means they're playing the game and want legitimate feedback on how to improve their builds, not some guy with designer v to come and say "haha trash build can't salvage go quit the game"
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:50:54 i can build fast but i'm terrible when it comes to creativity, the most i can do is just copy some existing historical aircraft, i'm terrible in terms of putting my thoughts onto the proverbial canvas
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:52:35 aaand, this is why i don't post here
creations-chat 2020-11-11 04:54:18 <@!774122294179135519> as for advice, experiment with combinations of corner wedges and wedgeblocks, it'll get you far
creations-chat 2020-11-13 22:45:54 input? this is probably the most technically challenging build i've done in a while, it's a just cause 3 imperator bavarium "tank"
