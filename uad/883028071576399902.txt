general 2022-02-01 15:27:11 set force to max, set it to a key that you will never touch, and set the distance to the amount you want the piston to extend. But never take it into pvp or else if you get hit you will crash your game
general 2022-02-01 15:28:36 xd
general 2022-02-01 15:29:36 it extends something a magical amount

general 2022-02-01 15:34:56 while not compromising the turret ring
general 2022-02-01 15:35:09 and also to make intricate details
