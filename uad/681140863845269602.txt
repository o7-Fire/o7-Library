The Tale of aharrowingthought (681140863845269602)
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 02:03:07 I joined the community finally because I heard someone built the Unsc Infinity, I want his name so I can kek him with my covenant super carrier
the-dump 2020-06-12 02:07:58 I heard someone has a giant UNSC Infinity
general 2020-06-12 04:59:33 the carl bot is for suggestions right?
creations-chat 2020-06-12 05:21:41 some people are actually impressed by my halo super carrier XD I didn't think anyone would like it, it has a very bad beam at the front but other than that I suppose it's ok
creations-chat 2020-06-12 05:22:36 here it is with the snazzy lights turned on
creations-chat 2020-06-12 05:23:20 however it is still a WIP and is not fully armed and the thrust matrix is not complete
creations-chat 2020-06-12 14:18:12 it is so beautiful....
general 2020-06-13 01:38:37 what is this cannon thing? is it for the summer update?
general 2020-06-13 01:41:06 what would be amazing is if they added some kind of heat laser for the summer update that had a constant stream of part burning fire but only stayed on for 5 seconds and had a 5 second cooldown, you would be limited to 2, but they will never add that
general 2020-06-13 01:41:28 nah make it like 10 cannon blocks
general 2020-06-13 01:41:41 I want to stuff a ton of them on my dreadnoughts and galleons
general 2020-06-13 01:42:38 if we are limited to 2 cannons that's 2 cannons on a ship, that would be pretty pathetic
general 2020-06-13 01:42:46 10 cannons is balanced
general 2020-06-13 01:43:25 yeah
general 2020-06-13 01:44:01 cannons are worse than rockets so why can't we have more or the same amount?
general 2020-06-13 01:44:33 tell me how many ship cannons you see with tracking funtions?
general 2020-06-13 01:45:04 yes
general 2020-06-13 01:45:11 I know the buisness very well
general 2020-06-13 01:45:39 use trails they look slightly better
general 2020-06-13 01:45:46 just turn them off
general 2020-06-13 01:46:32 ok, I like to make very nice looking but also very powerful and combat effective builds, can't I have my cake and eat it too?
general 2020-06-13 01:46:58 noice battleship
general 2020-06-13 01:47:03 10/10
general 2020-06-13 01:47:34 I'm working on a battleship of my own, in space
general 2020-06-13 01:49:05 I can fit like 10 or so guided missiles in the bulbous part of my ship
general 2020-06-13 01:49:16 that isn't balanced
the-dump 2020-06-13 03:04:16 finally armed and dangerous
the-dump 2020-06-13 03:04:26 tomorrow, I do the guided missiles and hatches
general 2020-06-22 03:40:05 what happened to cannons? 😦
general 2020-06-22 03:40:15 I was getting excited :C
general 2020-06-22 03:40:30 and then I suddenly had my soul crushed
general 2020-06-22 03:40:43 no
general 2020-06-22 03:40:53 fireworks is for winter last year
general 2020-06-22 03:41:01 it may return this year though
general 2020-06-22 03:41:10 don't buy the gamepass
general 2020-06-22 03:41:20 just wait for the winter event to come again
general 2020-06-22 03:41:44 what
general 2020-06-22 03:41:50 oh man
general 2020-06-22 03:41:53 that's dark
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:11:06 If halo married the star wars prequels
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:12:10 (If you can't understand the reference, it is the U N S C Infinity except it has the observation tower and absolutely massive hangar of the providence and it looks wack)
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:12:41 nah
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:12:48 I am exhausted
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:12:53 ok sure
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:13:27 
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:13:32 I really want to sleep
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:13:42 I'll give you an interior pic then I'm done
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:14:12 
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:14:40 
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:15:27 the observation deck has a giant throne that is a great place for a nice view
creations-chat 2020-06-23 06:15:34 good night
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:28:10 do it
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:28:25 it
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:28:29 do it
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:28:40 nani
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:31:25 so symptomatic, I'm making this ship for one reason: master shipwright rank. I already have about 2k on the hull alone, but these things on the side are were the real blocks come in, with these alone I can get to about 5k blocks and do interior for 6k, the only trouble will be getting it into the hall of fame
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:31:53 what do you think?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:32:56 
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:33:02 happy?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:33:27 nah
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:33:41 if I was an amazing builder
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:33:44 explain this
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:33:55 
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:34:19 literally nobody likes my builds
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:34:28 besides close friendss
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:34:56 it may be amazing, but there is always something more amazing
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:35:26 or maybe this community just hates star wars
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:35:36 like really really hard
creations-chat 2020-06-28 00:36:02 oh nice
creations-chat 2020-06-28 03:35:11 just gotta do the sails and interior now boiz
creations-chat 2020-06-28 03:35:27 and more ropes
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:30:16 honestly, what do you guys think of my ship?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:31:26 what?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:32:44 sails would be so painful...
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:32:46 but ok
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:33:53 do you like the weird cylinder towers at the front and back?
help 2020-06-28 06:08:10 do locked motors actually have any purpose besides motor lock compression?
help 2020-06-28 06:08:49 I'm pretty sure that was an accident that rick was like "it's not a glitch or a bug, it's a feature!!!"(which I am glad for)
help 2020-06-28 06:09:08 so what was their original intent basically?
general 2020-06-28 06:59:12 Hmmm... I made a mediocre pirate ship and I could apply for the shipwright IV rank or designer I, which is better?
general 2020-06-28 06:59:49 wait really
general 2020-06-28 07:00:03 oh that's great then
general 2020-06-28 07:00:30 it is 2500 blocks I can't apply for shipwright V
general 2020-06-28 07:01:13 despite looking mediocre, it is a SUPER tiny ship
general 2020-06-28 07:01:22 
general 2020-06-28 07:02:09 literally 500 of the blocks on that thing are just in the ropes that tie down the masts too
general 2020-06-28 07:02:11 so
general 2020-06-28 07:02:16 it is smol
general 2020-06-28 07:02:21 smol and ugly
general 2020-06-28 07:03:46 eat steak pills
general 2020-06-28 07:04:09 steak pills contain an ENTIRE STEAK inside a smol unhealthy pill
general 2020-06-28 07:04:16 but it fill you up fast
general 2020-06-28 07:04:58 (RazorCo does not take responsibility for food poisoning)
creations-chat 2020-06-28 07:14:37 shoutout to duckdx for being a troll by disliking every single creation on the entire creations channel, regardless of quality
creations-chat 2020-06-28 07:14:46 
creations-chat 2020-06-28 07:15:56 don't be a troll kids :P
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:47:38 how to have massive builds without lag: no glass, no lights, no motors, no rockets, no pistons, nothing that requires a script to run or releases particles.
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:49:24 exactly
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:49:28 every block
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:49:31 needs a script
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:50:40 doesn't running like 20000 scripts at the same time slow down the game?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:51:29 no
creations-chat 2020-06-28 14:52:15 I don't start lagging when loading until around 6k blocks
creations-chat 2020-06-28 18:37:36 too orange
creations-chat 2020-06-28 18:37:41 very slightly
creations-chat 2020-06-28 18:38:06 a little less bright and slightly more yellow and you will literally be perfect
general 2020-06-28 23:03:26 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-roblox-when-you-ship-gif-17539329
creations-chat 2020-06-29 00:05:36 yes
creations-chat 2020-06-29 00:05:43 so can every weapon
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:01:15 the rank application process seems a it intense to me
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:02:15 despite qualifying for shipwright IV and designer I think either I-II, I'm not sure it's worth my time to apply because you have to make a video and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:02:43 and if you don't respond within 5 minutes of a mod dming you you forfeit the rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 17:03:40 read <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 18:47:44 yep
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 18:47:52 that's totally normal lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:51:38 anyone up for a pirate ship battle?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:16 turn on weld
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:22 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:40 that's because magnets break if you have a large creation
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:53:50 the weld completely stops working
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:54:02 however it still pushes and stuff
general 2020-06-29 20:58:22 yes
general 2020-06-29 20:58:32 I understand all of that
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 20:59:59 on my magnets theory or the pirate battle <@163143541160148992> ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:17 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:23 perfection
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:00:58 I use folds to make my masts taller at the cost of looking as smooth
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:01:13 also I use those ropes on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:01:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:00 I do 1v1s in organized battles
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:10 but nothing with the commoners
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:38 the shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:02:42 the spam cars
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 21:03:06 leave them to their own devices
bug-reports 2020-06-30 04:48:00 try to explain this. just try. I literally cannot place 1x7 beams going in that direction horizontally (it affects all save slots, pretty minor bug)
bug-reports 2020-06-30 04:58:09 is there a way to fix it?
bug-reports 2020-06-30 04:58:35 because it is literally the most annoying thing in the game
bug-reports 2020-06-30 04:58:41 besides shredder bugs
bug-reports 2020-06-30 04:58:46 and spam cars
general 2020-06-30 14:14:28 Did rick just give up on adding cannons during the summer event completely or is he doing it in a separate update?
general 2020-06-30 14:16:13 it would be nice if someone cleared it up in the development channel
creations-chat 2020-06-30 14:18:17 I believe so
creations-chat 2020-06-30 14:18:25 I've seen videos there before
creations-chat 2020-06-30 14:18:38 and those people didn't get keked by a mod
general 2020-06-30 14:20:35 🤦‍♂️
general 2020-06-30 14:21:43 perhaps rick is just patching that random bug with not being able to leave your plot
general 2020-06-30 14:21:53 and cannons will come later on
general 2020-07-01 05:44:58 oh man
general 2020-07-01 05:45:05 bruh
general 2020-07-01 05:45:10 why would you do that
general 2020-07-01 05:45:53 bruh
general 2020-07-01 05:46:01 you leaked someone's real life identity

general 2020-07-01 05:48:26 
general 2020-07-01 05:48:45 no
general 2020-07-01 05:48:53 it is just a regular ghost ship
general 2020-07-01 05:48:59 not any specific ghost ship
general 2020-07-01 05:49:33 purified water your name looks like someone I know in the Imperial Reunifications Fleet

creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:58:59 I don't mean flying pirate ships
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:59:26 I mean pirate ships with C A N N O N S so we can have like epic 4v4 pirate ship battles
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:59:33 in the water
creations-chat 2020-07-01 05:59:54 just convert your space pirate ship to a normal pirate ship
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:00:12 
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:00:43 no
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:00:46 it is a tripod

creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:06:46 b r u h
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:07:15 idea
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:07:23 I'll offer anyone who wants to learn how to make pirate ships classes actually
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:08:16 yes, learn to make ghost ships
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:08:30 or not ghost ships
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:08:52 no
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:09:00 I docked at that guy's port
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:09:11 he had a little dock sticking out the side
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:09:41 also all my ships actually rock from side to side because of a little device I add onto them
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:10:24 do you know if rick is adding cannons in the next update or just scrapped them entirely?
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:10:34 because I really need actual cannons
creations-chat 2020-07-01 06:10:38 for ships
general 2020-07-01 19:05:47 b r u h
general 2020-07-01 19:06:00 someone in another server thinks I'm banned here lol
general 2020-07-01 19:06:19 bout to send a screen shot of these messages to blow up his tiny brain
general 2020-07-01 19:20:52 b r u h
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:15:42 I built a ship that eats and traps other ships inside of itself, useful for tormenting noobs on their tiny spam boats
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:16:11 because there are so many holes in the ship though
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:16:21 it only has 1700 or so blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:16:30 so it moves EXTREMELY quickly
creations-chat 2020-07-01 23:16:37 and has nearly no lag
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:23:06 why didn't you like the ship?
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:23:23 I can make the black pearl
creations-chat 2020-07-02 00:23:44 I just like creating freaky ships and torturin people
general 2020-07-02 03:29:48 who do you call when there's a lag maching in the neighborhood?
general 2020-07-02 03:32:33 oh
general 2020-07-02 03:32:40 it is a vip server
general 2020-07-02 03:32:52 lol
general 2020-07-02 03:33:26 I wouldn't report this bruh for lagging, it was a legit build, just, a very laggy but legit build
general 2020-07-02 03:33:38 it was a joke
general 2020-07-02 03:34:01 also it was the vip server of a youtuber
general 2020-07-02 04:05:05 maybe some noobs were dming him or something
general 2020-07-02 04:05:31 oh
general 2020-07-02 04:05:36 he must be offline
general 2020-07-02 04:07:09 
general 2020-07-02 04:08:36 my roblox is slow for one reason alone: someone built a giant nuclear reactor that uses up the entire bounding box and has realistic explosions
general 2020-07-04 20:53:59 hello

creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:11:10 I have to delete this entire thing because I built it wrong
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:11:21 that took like
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:11:29 8 hours or so
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:22:56 she?
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:23:02 or it
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:26:44 ok
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:34:49 I'm so glad someone actually added seats to the airport
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:34:53 imagine if
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:05 there were actually
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:10 seats
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:16 that came with the airport
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:27 maybe even some detail
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:32 like a shop
creations-chat 2020-07-08 07:35:38 or security checkpoint
creations-chat 2020-07-08 16:43:43 OK WHO PINGED ME?
creations-chat 2020-07-12 05:48:14 they fly now?
creations-chat 2020-07-12 06:25:26 one by one wedge, one by two wedge, red wedge, blue wedge, this half wedge is good as a little bar, my, my, how many wedges there are, but we still need more
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:51:00 did you know that madattack has only ever joined about 20 games?
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:51:23 (of plane crazy)
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:51:40 if you look at the badges, only 195 people have it
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:52:02 so that goes down to about 20 games if each server had around 9-10 players
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:52:38 he might use an alt so not everybody swarms him
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:52:40 also
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:52:43 I did no math
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:52:49 just like basic division
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:53:04 the original developer
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:53:10 for plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:53:32 bruh what am I doing
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:54:52 OH BOY
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:55:16 this is the most likes I have ever gotten on a creation
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:55:49 every star wars build gets dislike spammed
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:56:00 but maybe larger scale halo ships are the way to go
creations-chat 2020-07-12 20:57:38 maybe everybody liked that ship because I threatened to glass the entire planet if anyone reading that didn't like my build
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:11:39 which material is immune to rockets again?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:12:42 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:13:09 
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:13:45 who?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:13:58 I might know that guy...
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:14:14 I think he has a venator class star destroyer in the hall of fame right?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:15:09 Jared
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:15:22 do you know which material is immune to rockets again I forgot?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:15:30 it's cobblestone right?
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:24:42 nvm it was explosive blocks on arm on key
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:24:50 weirdly specific
creations-chat 2020-07-13 03:27:17 I'm on my second currently
creations-chat 2020-07-26 06:53:15 A massive 4-propellor Vtol capable of carrying drop-down vehicles and a reasonable amount of people, while also boasting an array of rockets frontward facing easily capable of taking down any native alien population and their giant tree they live in, it also includes auto-stabilizers utilizing conveyors that can be enabled or disabled to ease piloting or perform advanced maneuvers, it is also capable of speeds up to 200mph in stable flight, overall, a pretty nice assault Vtol when supported by military helicopters or other vtols of a smaller class, name: Rendezvous
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:01:36 Are YOU in need of absolutely massive tree cutting services but can't do it yourself because of a 9-foot-tall native alien population trying to stop you from mining a rare metal under their home? WELL YOU NEED THE DRAGON C-21 GUNSHIP TODAY
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:02:53 I've met rickjej139 in-game before
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:03:32 rickje gonna be banned
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:03:42 from his own game
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:03:44 sad
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:05:04 hello?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:05:17 what...
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:05:24 I've got to go to bed so uh...
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 14:18:36 who pinged me?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 18:37:53 yeah boys
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 18:38:31 I'm a level IV Vtol engineer now
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:49:17 WHO PINGED ME????
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:55:04 yes
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:55:13 the back half is very short
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:55:25 and I am going to fold upwards the horizontal wings
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:55:48 it might total around 6-7 folds
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:56:50 unfortunately, glassing beams are not possible until rick adds excavation drills and I can dig up the forerunner artifact hidden beneath the mountains
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:57:22 I can learn everything I need to know with the tech on the forerunner dreadnought
creations-chat 2020-07-27 02:58:28 the mods can turn you down still if they think your build was low effort
creations-chat 2020-07-27 15:12:35 uuhhhhhhhh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 15:12:52 so I'm at 165.something save data used
creations-chat 2020-07-27 15:13:45 so the only way to delete a build to make space is the unload the CAS and load a different build and then save it as an empty plot
creations-chat 2020-07-27 15:14:01 but if I unload it does it just reset to the way it was before?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 15:14:21 hello?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:14:33 uuhhhhhhhh
so I'm at 165.something save data used
so the only way to delete a build to make space is the unload the CAS and load a different build and then save it as an empty plot
but if I unload it does it just reset to the way it was before?
general 2020-07-27 15:16:05 uuhhhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:16:47 can you answer my question <@!518454798190772224>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:16:58 uuhhhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:33 this is my alt
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:41 or wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:47 no this is my new main
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:17:56 I switched accounts a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:10 and so I have 3 alts now
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:27 but little deer I'm over the save data limit
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:18:53 does it not delete the build until I leave the game that goes over the save limit <@!518454798190772224>
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:19:36 ok good
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 15:20:33 thanks for that
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:48:31 there's no space ship rank so I'm going to turn this into a Vtol and get expert Vtol engineer rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:48:57 like the devs care XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:02 or discord mods actually
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:27 I don't make friends
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:31 :(
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:49:51 nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:50:43 I'm joking you crazy guy, I said something ridiculous to throw off your brain
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:34 I hate the ORS covenant super carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:37 with passion
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:51:49 it's just a cloned and upscaled CAS
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:52:24 CAS hull is a nightmare duckdx
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 16:52:31 that took 3 days
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:37:58 do yall' like my CAS?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:38:22 I posted it in <#384025409945337856> a min ago
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:38:49 it's already covered up by 1000 other folks stuff though
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:38:57 eh it looks mediocre
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:39:12 yes
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:40:08 oh that's nice
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:40:22 but it's a custom painted CAS from Halo
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:40:51 what it looks nothing like that
creations-chat 2020-07-27 18:41:58 I've been considering making the CAS into a Vtol and getting level V Vtol engineer expert
general 2020-07-27 19:03:39 yes
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:08:29 I have a giant CAS that isn't from a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:08:43 it's 5331 blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:09:42 don't post people's tutorials in <#384025409945337856> lol noob that's technically stealing because someone else designed it and you're posting it under your name
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:11:16 I hate myself
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:12:25 I am only a Vtol Engineer level IV because of this :(
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:12:44 dragon c-21 from avatar
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:12:50 and not a very good one :(
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:14:54 I just had one goal for this ship, get it into the hall of fame so I can flex on everyone, but then like 100 newbies posted their builds and buried mine deep into the screenshot wall never to be found again unless someone randomly searches up CAS covenant carrier and stumbles upon it by accident :(
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:16:01 uh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:16:05 bruh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:16:25 dam calm down, you'll get better
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:16:51 was the tutorial plane?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:29:17 :(
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:29:29 my CAS is a modified one
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:29:36 it isn't exactly like a normal CAS
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:29:47 there were actually many different types of CASs
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:30:20 some were long, some were short, some were huge, some the size of a stalwart
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:30:32 ik
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:31:08 you're right
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:31:23 the only halo games I've played were halo reach and sins of the prophets
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:31:42 I'm not a true Halo fan :C 😭
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:39:11 I was almost certain there were like different types of CAS carriers like one was weird and blueish and others were purple and blackish like patterns or something : /
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:52:19 does this really look that awful? :C
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:53:26 there are only 3 downvoters on image one
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:53:33 but my friend said it was too short
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:53:59 I ran out of space
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:26:54 wow
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:26:59 what a toxic guy
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:34:35 :/
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:38:04 it's fine
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:40:07 it's odd how so many builders with lots of badges and mediocre builds are complete scumbags that do nothing but insult people on the internet over a game
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:41:19 uh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:41:26 that's not what I meant
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:44:40 I mean I build stuff like this and then all of a sudden some random guy comes out of nowhere and pings me and says "lol trash" and just acts toxic and they have about the same building skill as me but took the time to get every role
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:45:19 that ship looks good right?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:45:31 no I mean almost all my builds
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:46:40 uh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:46:46 that took me 3 hours
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:47:25 don't build tutorials :/
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:47:32 don't build them ever
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:47:56 make everything yourself, you'll get better with practice but not copying from a youtuber
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:48:07 personally tutorials are too slow
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:48:18 and I hate every second of them
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:48:42 I would never follow a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:48:49 still
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:53:00 uh
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:53:06 don't follow tutorials
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:57:27 what do you guys think of my space ship?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:57:52 is it too blocky?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:58:17 doesn't look that blocky to me :/
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:59:01 where would you say it's the most blocky? I'm still working on fixing up the hull and the paint job so I can make changes
creations-chat 2020-07-27 22:59:41 <@!697786877444358186>
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:00:54 I hate doing covenant ships because they're so beautiful but too hard to make perfectly
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:01:26 it's really too long?
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:02:38 well I actually made it a lot shorter than the image because I was just like this is way too long
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:03:05 huh....
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:03:13 oh I see what I did wrong
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:03:24 the back is down too low
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:03:32 it should be much closer up
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:03:46 and just taller in general
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:05:13 well for now my CAS will remain on my account until I am no longer extremely burnt out from 32 hours of building it and delete the back half and reconstruct it
creations-chat 2020-07-27 23:06:22 last time I built a 6k block build it took me 2 months to come back to the game purely from how burnt out I was
creations-chat 2020-07-28 05:57:13 name it the Crimson Aster
creations-chat 2020-07-29 21:26:51 they do basically nothing
creations-chat 2020-07-29 21:26:58 (normal surfaces)
general 2020-08-10 18:11:16 So many explosions.
general 2020-08-10 18:12:00 What.
general 2020-08-10 18:12:18 What.
general 2020-08-10 18:12:26 What.
general 2020-08-10 18:12:30 Where are you?
general 2020-08-10 18:12:51 Where are you??
general 2020-08-10 18:13:11 Idk that place, where are you?
general 2020-08-10 18:13:30 Idk that place, where are you?
general 2020-08-10 18:13:35 (joking)
general 2020-08-10 18:14:04 Idk that place, where are you?
general 2020-08-10 18:14:15 Canada I hear is weird
general 2020-08-10 18:14:27 I know many people that speak english in Canada.
general 2020-08-10 18:14:52 I know many people that speak french in Canada.
general 2020-08-10 18:15:04 I know many people that speak english and french in Canada.
creations-chat 2020-08-17 13:40:28 If it's an american fat man it must be pretty obese, same with russians.
general 2020-08-17 15:24:04 Lol why does my triangular sails experiment have like 20 likes.
general 2020-08-17 15:24:16 It's literally so ugly it's gay.
general 2020-08-17 15:25:09 Wdym?
general 2020-08-17 15:26:13 No way he'll choose more than like one person for a temporary job, I'll believe it when I see more than one update in a month. XD
general 2020-08-17 15:27:10 Actually that would be an unfair standard because not even developer teams can accomplish monthly updates in most cases...
general 2020-08-17 15:40:34 We don't need a new map smh.
general 2020-08-17 15:41:17 I like it being separate from everything else.
general 2020-08-17 15:41:32 I like social distancing in my islands.
general 2020-08-17 15:43:16 I think prototrude has literally made videos about exploiting firework range.
general 2020-08-17 15:43:30 To become sniper rifles.
general 2020-08-17 15:44:26 Bruh I hate life.
general 2020-08-17 15:44:32 It's so depressing.
general 2020-08-17 15:46:24 Yikes.
general 2020-08-17 15:46:42 Wouldn't want to get robbed by that lady.
general 2020-08-17 15:46:53 Oh you're right.
general 2020-08-17 15:48:52 > I get headaches when im stressed, and also through wearing masks for a long time. Breathing in all the trapped gasses mixed with oxygen. So like, how am I supposed to do school? I explained to my mom why I liked online over in-school, but she choose in-school for the socialization.
<@!505835349889777685> 
"BUT SHE CHOOSE IN-SCHOOL FOR **SOCIALIZATION** " Every doctor in America: O_O
general 2020-08-17 15:51:58 Lol if air passes through the masks that means the virus can pass through the mask, if you're suffocating inside the masks then that means it's working, if you're struggling to breathe then the mask is working about half as well as just not breathing at all.
general 2020-08-17 15:53:21 That filter is small enough to stop bacteria and stuff, but viruses are INCREDIBLY small compared to bacteria and stuff. The filters aren't small enough on surgical masks.
general 2020-08-17 15:53:57 The mask lets about half of what goes in out though too
general 2020-08-17 15:54:10 They don't keep the virus in or out effectively.
general 2020-08-17 15:54:29 You have to use custom masks or respirators.
general 2020-08-17 15:54:46 Also you have to wear goggles and cups over your ears.
general 2020-08-17 15:55:03 Because you can get viruses through your sinuses and eyes.
general 2020-08-17 15:55:35 Yes you can.
general 2020-08-17 15:56:05 “The virus has been detected in tears and conjunctival swab specimens from individuals with COVID-19,” Duh says. “If someone rubs their eyes and then touches someone else or touches a surface, that kind of transmission mechanism could occur.”
general 2020-08-17 15:56:51 I think some viruses you get through your ears.
general 2020-08-17 15:56:59 I wasn't directly saying covid did it.
general 2020-08-17 15:57:23 Just viruses get in and out of you through almost any hole.
general 2020-08-17 15:57:41 You're never truly safe from corona no matter what you do.
general 2020-08-17 15:58:09 Unless you literally stay at home for eternity blocked off from outside air.
general 2020-08-17 15:58:48 It can though, it is so light it can float in air and be bown around by the wind.
general 2020-08-17 16:01:29 Corona virus is essentially going to be another flu, it will probably come back this fall in a different and weaker strain and just like the flu it will target mostly the elderly and very young and probably kill like 20k-40k people a year in the U.S.
general 2020-08-17 16:02:48 Eh my school is in an area that has not been affected by corona much, they don't have as many regulations as a result so we're probably just going to do the government mandated stuff and nothing else.
general 2020-08-17 16:03:03 Wow so chill.
general 2020-08-17 16:03:19 My Cpu is 241 C rn.
general 2020-08-17 16:03:42 ^
general 2020-08-17 16:03:46 Smart
general 2020-08-17 16:03:55 If you have no CPU it can't overheat.
general 2020-08-17 16:04:14 Lol we had 0 buster.
general 2020-08-17 16:04:46 My computer is two years younger than me.
general 2020-08-17 16:05:05 Lol
general 2020-08-17 16:05:18 Lol my computer isn't 16 years old. XD
general 2020-08-17 16:05:23 It's 22.
creations-chat 2020-08-18 04:39:07 It's inspired by the ship from interstellar, it has a similar main body design with a massive spiral corkscrew slowly spinning around the ship as it is propelled through space.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 13:36:22 <@!659802570474258500> On your acclamator the only thing you did wrong is when the back part doesn't curve, in the engine are the back of the triangle part should have 1x4 wedges going in towards the big box part or something.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:06:01 It's a joke man.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:06:14 It's meant to sound ridiculous and make no sense.
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:06:38 -_-
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:07:04 Do you honestly think that that suspension is compact lol??
creations-chat 2020-08-20 18:08:51 Ok just shut it, I'll remove it so you can enjoy your existence as the plane crazy fact checker with a bloated ego.

help 2020-08-21 23:10:12 If pvp was for testing, wouldn't it all be in the testing server?
help 2020-08-21 23:11:16 <@456226577798135808> I've solved your problem.
help 2020-08-21 23:12:03 No way he will answer that question lol.
help 2020-08-21 23:14:11 Also debates are ultimately pointless because people are generally somewhat emotional driven and sometimes care more about how things make them feel than the actual reality, i.e. many people would choose the blue pill over the red pill in the matrix and continue living the fantasy.
help 2020-08-21 23:14:56 So wether you're right or wrong it's unlikely to convince someone to accept a belief system they don't like.
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:26:43 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:26:51 I laughed.
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:27:31 Lol
creations-chat 2020-08-21 23:28:00 Because that's where all the bad children go. (who ignore their parents)

general 2020-08-26 11:12:30 Idk what overcame whoever made that.
general 2020-08-26 11:12:37 But good job mate.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 03:42:40 Does my thing with like a million motor locks and the ropes look good for a front?
creations-chat 2020-08-28 03:43:32 I tried using ropes instead of my normal thing in this frigate because the ropes are capable of being completely round and smooth with a perfect arc.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 03:43:57 But there were so many motor locks now the downside is I have a few sticking out.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 03:53:02 Luckily, it is a very short, but more detailed and better version of the Alliance sloop of war from the roblox game tradelands, so it only has one large body section and I have plenty more room for locks and mast detailing.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 03:55:13 Thanks for the advice btw, I'll see what I can do.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 04:10:44 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-28 04:11:11 I'm no tank expert, but there's a lot of flatish places where detail could improve the build.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 04:11:28 However I have no idea on how to detail tanks as I don't make them.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 04:11:41 Maybe ask for help from someone who can make them.
help 2020-08-28 04:12:07 Make them Vtols lol.
help 2020-08-28 04:13:26 All of my giant super massive space ships have to be either 0 grav because they would crash a server with the amount if rockets in them or if they're below 4k blocks it might be possible to make them 180 grav with a ton of rockets and helium.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 04:13:57 Oh also make the smoke pipes more transparent.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 06:14:26 It's so beautiful...
creations-chat 2020-08-28 14:43:26 I'm almost done with the exterior, how does it look so far?
creations-chat 2020-08-28 14:44:02 no
creations-chat 2020-08-28 14:45:56 I tried to make the front really good on the wooden rope structure thing on the front of real ships connecting to the bow by using ropes and like 100 motor locks to get them in a perfect position.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 15:08:56 > It used to fly and now it dosent, pretty sure you guys gonna hate this one
<@!432134043379826708> 0 Gravity mode my dude.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 17:39:25 Wth...
creations-chat 2020-08-28 23:47:07 The wing panels would slow down and lag the ship too much.
creations-chat 2020-08-28 23:54:00 How good does this look on a scale of 1-10?
creations-chat 2020-08-28 23:54:53 Also I designed a system on the guns that allows me to have a 10 rocket broadside by spinning the rockets on a reset motor.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 00:17:29 This build is over year and a half + 1/4 old, I found it on the formerly abandoned storage alt the ship I just made is on. This is the oldest build I currently have and I believe it was my tenth build I ever made.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 00:23:49 I think I never finished that one.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 00:24:50 LOL I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CONFIGURE AT THE TIME AND ALL THE ROCKETS ARE W/S AND NOTHING WORKS.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 01:23:43 Does anyone have a pirate ship clan or something?
general 2020-08-29 16:16:36 Huh
general 2020-08-29 16:17:55 Imagine building a dalada with speakers in pc.
general 2020-08-29 16:24:50 WHERE'D MY WOOD GO?
general 2020-08-29 16:25:29 Wow
general 2020-08-29 16:25:36 That's a lot of determination.
general 2020-08-29 16:25:49 I would probably walk 5 blocks to get my wood.

creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:33:46 Does anyone have a pirate ship?
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:33:56 If it's the case, I'd like to fite you.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:34:17 Takkkkkkeeee meeeeeee onnnnn!!!
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:34:56 And it has a 10 rocket broadside.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:35:19 Mine spins the rockets around inside so I can use all of them on one side.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:38:01 Pretty good.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:39:00 Mine also has slightly more accurate design I believe.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:40:14 Oh it's a galleon front.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:41:48 Mine was more of a sloop of war bow with the prow being much smaller and thinner than the main body and branching off from it and the keel rather than the forecastle being just a moved back part on the ship.
creations-chat 2020-08-29 21:44:03 Unfortunately, I made the forecastle a bit too tall and didn't curve it down enough.
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:45:51 Do you have a pirate ship? I'd like to fight you.
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:46:17 Chad ship would like to know your location.
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 23:03:23 > has this already been done?
<@!550482788550180875> Yes, I use those not often but sometimes. I usually put wings on the back too though for longer range.
general 2020-09-02 23:48:20 Rickje you amazing person... I have no more need for more than three storage alts for all my 100000k block builds...
general 2020-09-02 23:48:37 Noice tank.
general 2020-09-03 03:16:11 I did it once too.
general 2020-09-03 03:16:31 Mine looked relatively ok for literally attempt 1 at a passenger jet.
general 2020-09-03 03:16:54 And I was 1.7 months into the game at the time I believe.

creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:41:56 Uh...
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:42:04 It's like 3100 I believe.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:42:57 Effort is the only thing the ship has going for it lol, it would look better too if I hadn't run out of room for the curve forward of the wings and giant guns on each one.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:45:11 https://www.google.com/search?q=space+capital+ship&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS751US751&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=nUkImFjDRs2K3M%252CP-a-LRDgb2v_QM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kRhHDRdLEC2jZ4KXv8qHOKz_z9fVw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwilwrbgsc3rAhX1j3IEHYYrCKIQ9QF6BAgGED0&biw=1280&bih=689#imgrc=nUkImFjDRs2K3M I based it somewhat off this image here, but as I ran out of room for it it got more flat and square and ugly until now. Now it stands as a symbol of my failure.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:45:53 Wait that link doesn't work it takes you to the wrong thing.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:46:36 Look up the IRF Valdore or something from Star Trek I believe.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:46:55 That was the original vision before I ran out of plot space.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 00:47:47 From the Mogai class or something.

creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:42:19 I made the creepy nightmare monster space ship fly in normal gravity so now I can torture noobs on public servers.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:42:49 I put no effort into weapons though lol. I just turret spammed.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:43:28 I should have at least put the turrets on the bottom so people don't have to see them.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:44:24 I have found that lots of turrets are extremely effective on large builds, especially small fast turning ones.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:44:43 They look awful though.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 16:45:07 I normally put them inside the ship for that reason, but I built interior on the ship so there was no space left.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:14:59 Nice.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:15:39 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:16:20 Please help me I have no idea how to fix this awful space ship.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:17:31 This was the original.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:17:44 Which is better?
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:18:48 I don't like how blocky the wings are though and I can't round them out because I ran completely out of plot space.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:20:34 Why so?
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:23:16 How could I improve it?
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:27:24 How can I improve my ship though, I messed up super bad but I don't want to delete it.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:27:35 
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:27:51 It looks terrible.

creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:29:37 Ideas.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:29:52 I messed up on this space ship super bad.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:30:06 I don't know how to make it look good.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:33:57 <@!487684157552721930> What should I do with the wings?
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:36:00 I agree.
creations-chat 2020-09-04 20:36:11 That is literally legendary.

creations-chat 2020-09-05 00:56:07 Does nobody have suggestions about the thing I put in creations?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 00:57:55 Plenty of people are disliking it but none of them are telling me why or how I can fix it.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 00:59:48 <@!393858481268064266> So you think I can improve my build but what do you think I should do to it?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:03:52 Uh...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:04:01 I think that's because they were tutorials.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:04:34 Literally no one in the community with any culture likes tutorials, noobs will follow them and pretend like they are building gods.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:05:47 You should have seen the tank fish jet, so many noobs followed the tutorial.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:06:07 The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor took over like every server.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:07:48 Why are people liking my build, I want people to dislike it and tell me how to make it better not say it's good as is.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:09:00 Hmmm...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:09:05 Like in what area?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:09:09 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:09:55 Hmmm...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:09:56 Ok
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:10:02 Sounds really nice.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:10:11 What color and brightness would you recommend?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:10:25 I think neon green might do well.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:10:35 Hmm yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:11:10 Ok
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:11:15 Thanks for the idea.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:16:55 They are thumbnails for tutorials he makes.

creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:17:19 Herrguggi why you change your name back.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:18:02 Oh true.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:18:23 Also do you have advice to improve my space ship?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:21:33 Anybody got improvement ideas? (I'm working on fancy lighting.)
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:22:53 I mean aesthetically.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:23:49 I can't do that unfortunately.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:23:55 I'm out of plot space for it.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:24:14 le I have
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:24:36 What you're looking at right there is like 5 folds.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:24:53 Hmmm I could fit good thrusters there...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:25:22 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:26:14 I'm really glad to be in this community lol, I never would have thought of exposed engines before.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:26:20 Thanks folks.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:59:14 Do these engines look nice?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 01:59:43 So good or bad?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:00:27 Use half blocks instead of regular blocks and make everything ice material.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:00:55 Ice has the bonus feature of being extremely lightweight, in fact the lightest thing in the game.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:01:02 Next to fabric.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:28:29 Guysssss I built custom engines and did a reasonable amount of lighting like you suggested and it's beautiful thanks so much for your help everyone!
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:29:13 
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:29:36 It's a space ship inspired by Romulan designs from star trek.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 02:29:59 It takes a bit of all their capital ships and a bit of my own design and blends it together.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:51:04 Yay almost done with me space ship after a few lighting tweaks.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:51:19 The lights on the wing aren't bright enough.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:57:27 I have never found a worthy opponent for my space ships in public pvp servers.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:57:51 Public pvps are just shredder bug and missile spam simulator.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:59:46 More people liked the Ju-87 P-51 F4U monstrosity than my space ship...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 05:59:49 Wow...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 06:00:02 I'm depressed now if it's really that bad of a ship...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 06:00:13 Kill me.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 06:00:48 Nevermind found a long sleeve shirt and a high ceiling fan.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 06:00:56 Brb never.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:20:38 Does this look nice or can I improve more?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:20:49 
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:24:26 What?
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:28:22 You know I might be able to get Vtol Expert V rank once I make the ship fly...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:28:46 It's like 3200 blocks not including the scaffolding I used...
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:52:57 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 12:53:21 But those red markings are not on the real plane, remove them.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 13:08:38 Oh I've never seen a brownish Sr with red.
creations-chat 2020-09-05 13:09:57 I think it's time I just accept my build as terrible since it's taken 20 minutes to get 2 likes and I'll probably get 10 dislikes soon.
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:20:36 Is my space ship really that bad?
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:21:57 It took an hour to get 3 likes on this build while other builds take a minute to get 10, so I must be doing something wrong please help.
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:24:26 Because yes.
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:24:38 Don't question Rick giving us infinite save data.
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:24:49 He might take it away again...
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:25:13 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:25:46 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 13:25:48 I have three.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:03:11 A lot of people with terrible builds think their builds are great so they get mass down voted. That then makes them salty and toxic and they down vote every build they see that is better than theirs.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:06 A lot of the builds I saw in creations were legitimately bad.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:09:53 Can any of you please help me fix my ugly space ship though?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:15:34 Ok can someone please tell me how to fix my ugly ship now that the swashplate wars are over?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:21:17 Uh...
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:27:11 I haven't posted that build in a week as I went on vacation. I was also just posting it to see what people thought of it so far with the guns I had just added to the wings. He must have pinged the wrong person I guess.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:28:13 People still hate it lol, idk how I can make it look good because it seems impossible.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:33:55 A space ship without ship just space.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:34:51 So a one of those three wheeled tiny cars with rocket engines?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:35:37 That is so ugly.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:35:47 My eyes.

creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:37:27 What?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:43:02 Does anyone have time to help me for like 20-30 minutes?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:45:10 Chat has died.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:45:15 Beautiful.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:45:59 Hey do you have a brain <@!725088321214087279> ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:46:29 If you do you're 100x smarter than me.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:46:50 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:47:20 Not really unless you want to see it in person.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:47:47 My space ship looks terrible and nothing I do seems to fix it.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:48:05 Any ideas to fix it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:49:35 What?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:49:51 Which one?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:50:02 Expert or common people's?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:50:24 What's the command to get the server link again?

creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:03:30 Don't upvote farm.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:05:16 Which paint job is the best?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:05:19 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:05:19 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:05:52 I'm not spamming I'm just asking about paint jobs.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:06:09 Oh sorry then.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:06:53 I don't build boeings or buildings.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:06:58 Sorry.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:07:17 But if you want a space fleet in the background I've got your back.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:07:36 Sounds interesting.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:07:42 Cutter wings.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:08:14 You know the world trade center was built terribly.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 17:52:09 A youtuber called Dragonplatinum built a server crasher of over 16k blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 18:48:36 > should i try making a better version of those low effort sliding pvp builds?
<@!488868805557354497> What better version?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 18:49:32 Does it look Vtol expert rank worthy?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 18:50:50 It's half finished. Once I get the thrust matrix down and the hidden internal props it will fly from engines and tons of props with no helium. It'll be around 4,200 upon completion.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 18:51:16 > Is there a rank for building space ships
<@!665725154978168864> No
creations-chat 2020-09-12 18:51:33 You have to make it fly in full grav.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 19:41:36 Use conveyors then.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 19:42:29 You should be able to just put the projectile with conveyor engines that release after firing.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 19:59:26 I have a conveyor engine railgun design it's just not very good.

<@456226577798135808> Don't do that your thing might be deleted.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 20:56:31 Also nobody likes people who beg for likes.
general 2020-09-12 21:21:34 Hi
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:45:14 Uh...
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:45:25 I did use cylinders...
creations-chat 2020-09-13 01:59:51 > can someone tell me what the purpose of paint blocks are
<@!637206552381751326> You can paint different colors on all sides.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:00:17 Unfortunately, not materials.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:00:44 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:01:23 Ice is slippery, metal things are heavier than usual, and fabric/ice has almost no weight.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:02:46 Only some.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:03:28 Diamond plate and metal are extremely heavy and ice and fabric are extremely light. Everything else is around the weight of a default block.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:03:52 Ice also has significantly less friction than usual.
creations-chat 2020-09-13 02:04:21 Too bad it looks scarred and deformed otherwise I might use it more often.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:26:16 Please put effort into your ships <@!662011073242595328> <@!683687642084540423> . I feel severe internal pain every time I see a ship like that. If you want to make a pirate ship I will literally give you help for free.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:26:35 
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:27:19 Well the bullets go through armor so...
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:27:32 No time at all?
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:27:41 Armor has some uses.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:28:20 My ships are more like ships of the line.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:28:42 My ships are no where near as good as Vip's ship, but they still hold their own.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:35:44 I've made an ironclad before.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:36:12 I made it will mostly 1x1 blocks on the iron parts so that it would actually be super heavily armored.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:36:23 Pain.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 00:36:35 It didn't turn at all barely.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 09:57:23 > Is this guy just disliking everything he sees?
<@!712273624865701921> Yeah this server has saltiness issues. Often noobs will have their spam cars mass downvoted (for good reasons) and they will react in rage, downvoting everyone else's creations.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 09:58:23 :/
creations-chat 2020-09-14 09:58:58 The server also has insanely high standards for jets and hates almost all types of them if they were ever in any tutorial.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 09:59:37 Oh it was a car F-150.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 10:00:24 Idk I guess people hate your truck. It might be that it is blue and people hate cyan/gray colors here.
creations-chat 2020-09-14 20:52:23 <@!718132999908098069> Why are  you advertising your tutorials in <#384025409945337856> bruh.

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:15:30 I'm about to do bad things to every good builder here's vision.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:15:50 Oh yes the reddish purple space cube.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:16:24 Breh.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:16:41 Just wait like 10 seconds and it will get deleted...
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:18:40 I was right.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:18:55 I knew it would be poofed. hehehehe
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:19:24 **Yes**
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:20:14 **He's destroying the evidence.**
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:20:46 Big brain tank design.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:21:02 ^^^
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:22:22 Should I build a much bigger ship of the line and go for a shipwright rank?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:22:56 What
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:23:22 Why'd you ping me?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:24:14 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:24:42 Actually you know I might try my hand at modern warships, I've never built one before.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:25:40 While you're here how do you think this looks?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:26:07 Is red bad?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:32:11 This belongs in the dump too right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:33:17 No
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:33:28 It just looks too "wedgy".
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:34:08 Also it didn't get very many upvotes so it's probably not that good of a ship.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 20:34:59 smh
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:48:48 I'm no tank expert. But there's a lot of stuff you could fix.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:48:54 Afk a minute...
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:52:55 Your turrets are also very bad, look at real turrets for an example.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:53:05 Also your top is extremely flat.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:53:14 Flat things are never good.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:53:31 Not on the turret.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:53:41 On the main body and tracks.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:53:48 Flat is usually bad.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:54:24 Don't build boxy and flat tanks even if they are from real life.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:54:40 90% of people in this community dislike flat, boxy things.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:57:31 That's roundish enough to be considered not boxy and flat.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:58:27 We don't have enough wedges.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:58:45 If we had enough wedges my builds would improve by 1000% instantly.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:59:43 That's got to be the ugliest tank I've ever seen.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 01:59:55 No
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:00:03 It's a voxel box on tracks.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:40:24 ^^^
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:41:11 Remove your self upvote before this space ship removes your homeworld.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:41:53 Is it a nice ship btw?
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:42:14 Just a little red around the edges.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:42:28 It's not a bridge it's an observation tower.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:42:54 Oh...
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:52:43 > **teach me the ways of how to get upvotes**
<@553754576709353494> 

Step one: Be a popular person. These players are the only one of two exceptions to the "no more than 20 upvotes before noobs block out the images" rule. 

Step two: Nothing besides ships and multi account rockets will ever be popular, so don't bother making what you like.

Step two point five and three quarters: The only way to actually get a reasonable amount of likes is by building something not with any creativity, but only by copying things in real life. (Only other exception to rule 3)

Step three: No one goes back to look through older builds and half the people that see your build won't like it but won't dislike it no matter how high quality it is so there's no chance of any build getting more than a few upvotes before noobs spam their builds, stopping it from being seen.

That's how to get a ton of upvotes in pcc my dude.

(NOTE: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A JOKE)
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:53:28 Why you chat clear breh.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:53:50 It's more satire than a joke I guess.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 02:54:42 A lot of people poke at those holes in the community and flaws when they don't have the right to complain because they aren't skilled and their builds are hated for a reason.

creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:20:20 > Should I post it?
<@!581846949901369365> Make the runway slate and use white lines, not yellow.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:20:32 > helicopters are parts of aeronautical engineering right?
<@!697154991521267873> I do not believe so.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:25:26 <#609442446249820211> Go for the heli technician or something it's called.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:26:00 I think for master ranks the build has to get to the hall of fame.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:26:45 Get 60 or more upvotes, and make sure it looks good enough that the council of rickjes will approve it.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:27:12 The hall of fame is no joke.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:27:33 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:27:55 You need to be good enough to get past the council of rickjes.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:28:40 No one can except Vips.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:29:49 Literally some of the best builds of their type ever have been turned down for Hof.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 10:31:20 If your plane isn't completely perfect in every way imaginable, and is the most revolutionary, most amazing, most detailed and impressive thing anyone has ever seen you are gonna have a bad time.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:54:45 Any tips for my steampunk airship's hull like detailing ideas?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:55:29 I need HUGE amounts of detail for this build because the sheer size makes smaller details almost unnoticed.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:56:35 <@!720751430595772418> So what do you think I need to change about the build?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:56:55 Wait you're a no rank.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:57:25 Why did you dislike my build if you don't know how to improve it and what's wrong with it?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:58:16 Ranks are a sign of achievement.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:59:12 I am fairly skilled I believe...
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:00:19 So Freddy if you are really like a godlike builder can you help me make my airship better?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:01:03 Well, if he dislikes my creation he doesn't like something about it.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:01:18 I just want to know what is wrong with it so I can try to improve it.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:01:43 It's not like I'm trying to kill him.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:02:03 Because I wanted to get his attention in case he went online?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:02:49 Ok I'm not a bad person dude I literally only want to ask if he has any ideas to improve it and what he thinks I did wrong...
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:03:11 
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:04:39 Oh you're probably having collision issues.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:05:34 There might be suspension issues or the motor is colliding with another block. Maybe decrease the torque if it is above 50.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:06:17 Wait I think I recognize your name now Freddy.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:53:21 4 Studs is supposed to be a meter I believe.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 17:54:09 Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:04:25 The rank I have is just from a space ship I built one day and felt like cashing in.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:26:52 Someone please help me I forgot how to paint.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:28:15 Actually Raz do you have any ideas for color schemes on my steampunk ship?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:29:34 I'm going for like a bronze color on the main hull but it doesn't seem to work because of having inadequate materials.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:35:18 While we're on the subject of paint please help me.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:35:47 Stop spamming.

creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:37:57 Raz should I use a specific material or just default with 80 70 60?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:47:40 Does this look better as a primary color?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:48:19 Thanks.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 18:48:41 I like the bronzeish color on the hull areas though.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:50:45 Please help me, I can't find a good color for the roof.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:51:10 This chat is useless nevermind.

creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:52:22 And the other two?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 20:53:35 Should I color the ladder fences the gold?
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:07:37 Read my custom status.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:08:15 Outlook not so good.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 21:08:33 Reroll and try again later.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:48:41 Set the blast radius to 0.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:49:07 Breh
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:49:52 I'm usually more concerned about one downvote on my builds even if it has 20 upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:52:48 Does anyone have advice on this front? (The material and paint is temporary and only helps with my depth perception and knowing which sections I'm working on.)

creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:53:34 Did chat just instantly die?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:54:08 Do you have any advice for that space ship's bow?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:54:32 What about the nose?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:55:01 What about the bow?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:55:14 What about the explanation?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:56:33 ...
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:56:39 Show me a picture?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:56:49 What about the control panel?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:56:56 What about the findign 1?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:57:29 Shino look at this noob.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:57:42 Stempoink.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:58:02 Like 5,200 or so.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:58:10 I never finished it.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:58:41 It's a bifold that goes from ground to sky height...
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:58:57 That balloon section is H U G E alone.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:59:09 I never finished it it doesn't fly yet.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:59:29 I was 80% done with the hull at the time I gave up.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:59:43 Never finished the paint job either.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 18:00:29 That ship looks high (off of the center) as hell.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 18:00:58 Yeah the bridge will be in the third fold part.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 18:01:18 It's going to be around 4 folds this ship will.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 18:01:33 Maybe 6 if I need to fold the citadels.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:28:27 > ah yes, gaming
<@683069192143896594> BrEh HoW?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:29:56 Photoshop?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:30:33 Those aren't real lol.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:30:43 There's no such thing as projector blocks.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:31:24 Ok sure, get rickje in here and tell him to give me a projector block. ;)
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:31:28 Oh ok.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:31:36 That's omega luls.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:32:01 I just had an idea.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:32:19 Minecraft pc, but it shows the roblox pc showing a minecraft pc showing a roblox pc.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 19:32:27 And it goes on forever.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:33:00 <@!297781925890883595> On you tomcat the top is extremely flat.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:33:27 It looks weird being that flat.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:33:40 Use half down 1x2 wedges.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:33:49 Then go up a half block level.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:33:56 And curve the top.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:34:11 OH IT'S SHINOHAIRY!
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:34:16 Hara*
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:34:51 <@!516385356006817792> Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:35:22 Yes.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:35:35 I have the link for it so there's no problems.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:35:50 I'm in the ps rn.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:38:25 Dragon's ps is so quiet.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:38:29 I really like it.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:39:31 A lot of skilled people are unranked. But generally, unranked folks are unskilled.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:39:43 Shino is an exception.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:40:16 I just picked up my Vtol ranks from one time I built the avatar gunship and a giant 3,200 block space dreadnought.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:41:01 They're pretty annoying to submit proof for and follow requirements but the expert ranks are worth it because you get +100 respect and expert vip server access as of a few weeks ago.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:41:39 Just get one expert rank, nothing else matters.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:41:53 Expert?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:42:14 Expert and master ranks are the only ones worth applying for.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:42:29 At least, in the creations department.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:42:50 :)
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:43:12 Wrong
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:43:21 The mods deny low effort builds.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:43:37 It has to AT LEAST look good.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:43:46 Block spam isn't allowed either.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:44:16 > asymmetrical german seaplane go brr
<@!509391216845258752> My eyes burn I hate non symmetrical builds.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:44:28 You did a good job though.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:44:51 That's so cursed it's not even funny.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:45:12 Put it in the hall of fame with russian T pose Redeemer statue.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 21:45:27 Every cursed build must go to the hall of famousness.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:37:48 Remove that self upvote before I remove you.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:38:24 Just 5k blocks bifold.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:38:47 This will be about a 7.2 k block dreadnought.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:38:58 Once I finish it.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:39:38 I've always wanted a master rank for my space ships. The logical choice would be Vtol Master. Unfortunately, it would be impossible to get because it requires being in the hall of fame.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:39:59 Getting into hall of fame with generally ~~~hated~~ builds like space ships is impossible.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:41:33 Actually further corrections, getting into hall of fame ~~with generally hated builds like space ships~~ is impossible. (With the exception of Russian Redeemer statue and some other meme builds that still look cool.)
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:42:10 Ik it looks almost real.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:42:20 It's scarily good and compact.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:44:04 I think Hof has a minimum of 10k blocks right?
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:45:44 WHAT
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:45:56 THERE'S NOT EVEN 60 PEOPLE IN VIP CHAT
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:46:30 It's one or two I believe, which is nearly impossible to get.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 22:47:13 I think one time this legendary supercarrier got submitted and it got 7 Hof downvotes despite having 5k blocks per fold and like 4 folds.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 23:04:01 What good frames.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 23:21:18 This problem took me an hour to solve.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 23:22:04 I've got everything set up for the fourth fold.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 23:23:16 You can't copy builds dude, especially from creations.
creations-chat 2020-09-18 23:23:19 ;)
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:13:35 > <@!681140863845269602> HOLY **** that is super cool, How many block have that?
<@409046768349609994> 3.7k currently, I'm working on the third out of five or six folds to be made.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:14:16 Your zeppelin impresses me exceedingly more though because of the accuracy.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:30:26 El tanko.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:51:57 Good job.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:52:19 This folding system looks and works like cancer.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:53:21 I had to literally go over the top of the build and fold the back section horizontally and vertically and also use locks with explosive block controls one when to position in place so it doesn't mess up the front.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 00:54:12 10/10 folding skills.
bot-central 2020-09-19 01:29:42 !expertservers
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:51:18 Please someone help me. I want to get at least above 10 likes on this creation once I finish the hull, but I suck at painting. Please help me paint the ship, if you are available sometime soon and willing to help dm me.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:51:32 Dear man.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:51:39 That looks insane.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:51:58 Git in the expert server 1.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:52:08 We have a giant black space ship half done.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:52:16 And some other weird stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:52:26 Just apply a random build.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:52:32 It's what I did.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:53:08 Vtol and plane are pretty easy because they only need 2k blocks, fortunately most of my space ships are over 4k and the one I subbed works in full gravity.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:53:18 yes.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:58:14 Proto I hear is actually pretty helpful.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 02:58:32 Rickje might not have found that exploit for fireworks without his vid.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:41:21 What do you guys think of this?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:41:37 I haven't finished it yet.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:41:45 I haven't finished it yet.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:42:15 Yeah but I want to know what you guys think of the main structure.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:42:19 That's all.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:43:19 It's nice to have a rating system so I can check and see how many people hate or like it it besides freddy and swag. I'm going to change the way the ship looks and my future plans for it based on ratings.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:44:29 Fred will dislike anything and everything I post because one time I ticked him off by pinging him and asking him why he disliked my build and how he thought I could improve it.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:45:01 :/
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:45:28 If I was Herrguggi or Vipempire making that somehow if they were as bad as me would you still think the same thing?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:45:41 ^ It's not painted yet.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:46:16 My eyes.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:47:06 It's extremely blocky.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 03:47:29 Thicken up and round out the parts that hold the props too.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:20:21 What should the primary color be for when I paint it some time in the distant future?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:20:40 Nerd my build has like 6 folds.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:20:48 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:20:55 Just use custom control surfaces.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:38:28 That's not really good enough for me Kai.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:39:02 I want master vtol engineer some day, which means my ship has to be close to perfect and everyone must be able to look at it and think it's perfect.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:39:59 But how?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:42:52 https://tenor.com/view/never-rick-astley-neve-gonna-give-you-up-gif-4398730
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:45:54 <@!464629635108306953> As you were saying?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:20:35 Who pinged me?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:20:55 Why...
creations-chat 2020-09-19 12:29:39 <@!662338416024879144> Your yacht is lacking some serious detail on the above deck sections. Put ladder fencing around the build and maybe raise up the hull section but leave the floor there so you can smooth it out on the bow. Also maybe work on a better color scheme and interior design. Your boat is also unusually tall. Remember that mods can turn you down for a rank if your build doesn't look too great, I suggest you try to really detail that yacht as well as you can.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 12:30:17 Great job on gradient though.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:50:10 Hmm...
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:50:14 Good idea.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:50:24 Any primary colors or stripes?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:51:15 Hmmm...
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:51:22 Ok I guess.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:51:35 You can get in the expert one server maybe?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:51:50 Oke.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 13:53:21 Oh I must have used the wrong ps, I'll be right there.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 14:01:21 Nobody notices things like that in <#504436696021204992> because they get covered by chatting in seconds.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 14:01:39 <#384025409945337856> Gives me at least somewhat of a lifetime.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 15:56:15 THANKS WHOEVER PINGED ME!
creations-chat 2020-09-19 15:56:25 I love diagonal stripes idea!
creations-chat 2020-09-19 16:33:21 <@!628523381209169930> I built that same Avatar gunship a long time ago but in green.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:29:01 It's inspired by a light cruiser from warhammer.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:29:34 Lol
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:29:45 Golden freddy still be angry at me.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:31:51 No idk who Bc is.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:32:51 He might be either a super skilled player who thinks my build is ehh or a super bad player who got his spam car downvoted 100 times. That's the case with most people who downvote reasonable quality builds.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:34:24 So you don't like anything I build then lol?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:35:07 If I build something like you "battleship" up there you would like it then I presume?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:35:37 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/756929214082449441
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:35:43 That's his build.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:35:53 This is my build
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:36:15 He believes my build is trash and his is basically hall of fame worthy.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:36:52 He however, has a personal agenda against me because I pinged him once to ask him for advice.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:37:47 I just want this guy to stop. Every build I have posted for the last half week he has disliked regardless of quality or style.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:38:06 And if you REALLY THINK I can improve my builds JUST TELL ME HOW.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:39:15 > Because you just posted the same build multiple times with different paint
<@!720751430595772418> Yes, asking if anyone had ideas for paint.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:40:02 I asked literally twice for painting advice and somehow I am spamming my builds according to freddy. It worked too, I got good work done with the help of a couple people.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:40:58 Ok seriously stop. I'm tired of these games.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:46:23 yes?
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:46:37 I do love a good suggestion to my builds.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 17:49:20 <@!614659754249420810>  Upvote farmer making one of the twin towers lol. You're pretty late to the party though.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:51:39 <@!614659754249420810> 9/11 Upvote farmer alert. Check <#384025409945337856> for more details.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:52:05 I've given up on my space ship.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:52:28 I thought it was cool, I was wrong I guess.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:52:39 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:52:51 I despise 9/11 upvote farmers.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:53:24 No it isn't.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:53:29 It got 5 dislikes.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:53:54 Yes they do.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:54:47 If your creation is GOOD it will be UPVOTED. If it is BAD it is DOWNVOTED. That means that because my ship got 9 upvotes and 5 downvotes my ship is terrible.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:55:42 Well 224jay didn't like the ship so it's probably pretty bad even if everyone else was just hating.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:55:56 On what?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:56:29 > <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
<@456226577798135808> Breh.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:56:44 That's literally why you downvoted my build?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:56:58 I roasted puri's tank?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:57:27 Ok then would you have upvoted it had it not had that comment then?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:57:43 Not good enough.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:58:12 Ok what can I change about the build to make you want to upvote it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 17:58:34 > maybe
<@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:00:30 I just want to build something actually special and really hot for the first time in my time playing plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:00:56 I've never gotten any of my builds over 48 likes. One day, I want to get at least 100 on any build.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:01:30 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:01:37 I can't get higher resolution.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:01:43 This is a 2008 macbook pro.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:02:08 I put it on max graphics too which is why I had 3.8 fps.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:02:26 Brilliant.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:02:30 WHat a genius.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:02:34 200 IQ
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:05:24 EXPERT SUPREME GETS IN VIP LOUNGE NOW?????
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:06:00 Ok that settles it, I'm going to finally get back to building things besides Vtols/ships.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:20:02 Is this close up enough to look good?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:20:55 This image doesn't look as good apparently because the camera is far away.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:22:03 Is this one better?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:22:55 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:23:47 Is this better?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:24:16 The front bulbous part will be out of view.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:24:30 The ship is too long XD.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:25:44 Hot.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:28:57 Is this zoomed in close enough bro?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:29:36 
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 18:30:01 "Zoom in more." "You need to see the whole build" Da ship is too long bro.

plane-crazy 2020-09-21 10:58:05 Impressive, master jedi.
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 20:05:36 Lol noob.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:32:44 > like bruh the terrain under is wasted
<@456226577798135808> Caves we need.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:33:46 It would be cool to have giant cave systems underground.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:33:49 That's why.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:34:07 No
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:34:16 I couldn't spawn my mega dreadnought.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:34:23 
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:34:43 That's literally 5 folds I  couldn't fit it underground.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 23:35:20 It would have to be like 40 blocks tall and 400 long and wide with the same size exit to reasonably easily fly my ship out from underground.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 09:24:34 > can we have an option to put outlines or remove outlines?
<@!586202944085688320> Roblox removed outlines for no reason, and the toggleable outlines system had already existed.

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:24:55 Hey does anyone know when the best time of day in EST is the best time to post creations?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:25:37 Yeah...
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:25:46 But when are the most people online?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:26:31 Hmmm....
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:26:55 I have an idea for a little science experiment to determine the best time to submit creations.
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:28:07 Yeah so many people chatting at 6:30 Am.
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:28:22 XD
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:28:51 Nobody is online then lol. ;)
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:29:23 Ask google.
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:29:35 Do EST to whatever timezone you're in.
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:29:55 Rigged.
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 10:30:30 Just like the capitalist system.

creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:37:27 <@!432134043379826708> Beautiful.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:37:40 I love the spider robot, so detailed.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:38:19 You should put like some giant cannons on the sides of the central bridge thing.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:38:31 Maybe like big railguns.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:41:05 <@!712273624865701921> Upvote farmer trying more water bottle stuff.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:41:25 Also the bottle looks terrible.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:46:50 How does this look?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:47:07 > Then should i change the plastic to clear glass instead of legacy glass
<@!712273624865701921> Just don't upvote farm.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:48:17 You've probably seen other people with more popularity in the community posting water bottles. That is a meme. It is not as funny if out of no context a random guy posts a terrible looking water bottle on a train.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:48:56 Don't do water bottles.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:49:11 You're trying to ride off of the meme to get upvotes.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 10:49:33 Goodbye.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 17:59:54 What is that bottom screen grey notice?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:17:43 Guns are a great weapon if you stack all 10 with a motor lock on one block because they will instantly melt any block they touch. You can easily cut larger ships in half or target their player character. Rockets on track mode deal 3x less damage than non tracking ones, but can chase shredder bugs. However for attacking large builds non track rockets are the king of dps.
general 2020-09-23 18:18:13 > finally i have the aeronautical engineer [II] rank!
<@!449636851473711104> I could literally apply any random plane I built once and get it.
general 2020-09-23 18:19:07 I can't afford among us because last time I checked it was 5$ on steam and I literally have less money than that.
general 2020-09-23 18:20:01 My vtol is stronger than yours.
general 2020-09-23 18:20:23 <@435946988559925248> Only vtol II bruh.
general 2020-09-23 18:21:15 This was my vtol.
general 2020-09-23 18:21:52 Well...
general 2020-09-23 18:22:01 I don't build much besides space ships.
general 2020-09-23 18:22:05 And pirate ships.
general 2020-09-23 18:22:34 Likely not since I don't like jets.
general 2020-09-23 18:22:55 I like si-fi and pirate age stuff.
general 2020-09-23 18:23:32 Some time I might turn this into a working Vtol.
general 2020-09-23 18:23:54 ???
general 2020-09-23 18:24:18 Sotp lol.
general 2020-09-23 18:24:41 I'm not even posting lol.
general 2020-09-23 18:25:25 Herrguggi's heli is so hot.
general 2020-09-23 18:25:39 Ain't nothin' like it.
general 2020-09-23 18:25:51 Except a few other helis.
general 2020-09-23 18:26:25 > petition to make rickje add heat seeking missles, but to also add flares
<@!658856948065763328> Suggestions is for this stuff, also we already have this stuff noob.
general 2020-09-23 18:26:54 Use a sparkler as a flare and launch it with a parachute.
general 2020-09-23 18:27:01 Even makes flare sounds.
general 2020-09-23 18:27:13 Also the rockets have TRACKING.
general 2020-09-23 18:27:27 So basically the same thing as heat seeking.
general 2020-09-23 18:28:25 Not like rick could make better tracking though either.
general 2020-09-23 18:29:00 Rocket tracking is probably as best as it can be for now.
creations-chat 2020-09-23 18:30:44 <@!515639429042274332>
creations-chat 2020-09-23 18:32:10 <@!515639429042274332> So you strongly dislike my build I see, but how do you think it could be improved?
creations-chat 2020-09-23 18:33:17 Make the wheels ice.
general 2020-09-23 18:34:16 Bruh.
general 2020-09-23 18:34:58 I hate it when like completely random players who have never submitted more than one or two medium quality builds randomly dislike your build for no reason.
general 2020-09-23 18:35:11 > is anyone else seeing invisible spring on suspension
<@456226577798135808> Yes, I've seen it happen on my trebuchet.

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:47:49 > <@!681140863845269602> the most effective vehicles for combat are fighters and against any good fighter guns are completely useless
<@!569298230983131137> Yeah you kinda need rockets for fighting fighters and they are the ultimate pvp vehicle.
general 2020-09-23 18:48:12 > maybe your builds are just bad
<@!260797229068058634> Yes.
general 2020-09-23 18:49:26 This is my situation with the random downvoter.
general 2020-09-23 18:49:58 The guy that downvoted has no ranks, and has never uploaded any build besides one downvote upvote fusion pixel art.
general 2020-09-23 18:51:03 > tell me the requirements
<@!569298230983131137> You can't get it any more. Also you had to invent a completely new technology type like inventing the first ever motor lock system or conveyor engine.
general 2020-09-23 18:51:51 No I mean like make the FIRST EVER INVENTED creation of any type.
general 2020-09-23 18:52:20 > its mechanism
<@!260797229068058634> Yes what I mean.
general 2020-09-23 18:52:40 It is closed.
general 2020-09-23 18:53:12 Random people come off the streets basically and ask for it while they have nothing worthy of it.
general 2020-09-23 18:53:50 Bruh prove it.
general 2020-09-23 18:54:31 Hot

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:58:58 Alright jay dog I'll see about removing the turrets or making better turrets.

plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:37:08 What's going on lol?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:38:26 A new map would be so fun!
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:38:51 Maybe even other islands or something and actual flat terrain instead of just infinitely rolling hills.
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:42:43 -mapsuggest  (Map)

Other planet things
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:42:47 Whoops.
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:44:29 -mapsuggest  (Map)

Other planet things 

Sorry there, meant to shift enter but accidentally just entered.

Add other planet type things like square rock platforms in the sky around 10k altitude, it would be very fun for rockets and space ships to land on the fake moon that's actually just a slate sky slab.
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:46:35 This is what I use to wreak havoc on servers. If someone refuses to bow down to me I just threaten to turn my thrusters on.

creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:30:11 Oh my gosh if I did that and it worked as a plan and I theoretically got it in the hall of fame I would have not one, but TWO master ranks.
creations-chat 2020-09-25 01:30:41 No I have expert ranks.

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:27:39 Hey Robo just a question but if I made this follow the requirements for both a ship and a vtol and land in water like space battleship Yamato could I get expert shipwright V?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:28:46 Nah it actually floats very well, only minor adjustments would be needed to make it float consistently on a waterline.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:29:13 I have Vtol expert.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:29:17 You have IV.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:30:20 I joined the game like 1.5 years ago and didn't decide to join the discord server until not long ago.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:30:40 That's insanely impressive if you got your rank that long ago.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:33:03 This is what got me my Vtol rank.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 14:33:55 That's an outdated photo before I made it actually fly in regular gravity but it looks better than the screenshot of it flying.
creations-chat 2020-09-25 20:22:32 > <@!681140863845269602> is that from 40k?

<@437152336176087052> Wrong.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:23:48 The Vip lounge knows what is good, and what isn't. I will accept their opinions on my builds readily.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:26:02 Look into the hall of fame, do you honestly think lower end builds belong there? IT'S THE HALL OF FAME. Just because a build is good doesn't mean it's good enough.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:26:31 It wouldn't get in there in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:27:12 Getting 60 upvotes doesn't guarantee you will be in the hall of fame/
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:27:28 It just allows you to submit your build to the lounge.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:29:26 Generally, Hof builds are 4,000 blocks at least. I believe creativity is also heavily required, because any good ship builder can make a legendary carrier, but not everyone can make a carrier that is truly special and unique.

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 18:39:20 I'm changing it a reasonable amount every time I post and see what people think so I can find the best possible version.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 18:40:18 It's gone from this to this in under a week from improvements.

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 18:42:06 You can see a bunch of small flaws in the older version.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 18:42:41 I'm not changing it to repost bruh. I'm literally just trying to improve it.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 18:43:24 Ok how about this, I'll never post anything at all again until the day that I die and delete everything I've ever posted. Does that make you happy?

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:27:46 I don't get paid for chores.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:28:21 Every penny I've earned has been from a business of some kind or another.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:28:52 Sometimes I smuggle snacks into school and sell them slightly below the price of lunch items.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:33:35 <@!501124282907099136> 

Honestly if you want stacks quickly just smuggle snacks into your school and sell them below cafeteria prices just by a little bit like a dollar or two since school cafe items are often extremely overpriced.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:34:48 Depending on your school's policies it may be against rules, but you can literally get 40$ per week safely without getting the information wide spread enough to be caught.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:38:49 Just buy like giant packs of candy at costco n' stuff and stuff empty parts of your backpack with them.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:39:06 Yes

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:41:32 :/
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:41:38 I guess.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:42:55 Idk. I can't even build stable mechs over 400 blocks so yeah.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:44:10 Uh...
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:44:29 That looks bipedal are you sure you know what a tripod is supposed to be?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:45:02 Also you need rockets and pistons to push up the legs.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:45:41 Pistons on the legs that are down pushing up so the third leg can move and rockets pushing the two non moving legs to the ground for stability.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:46:13 Rip lol.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:46:25 Just sell something your school doesn't have then.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:46:36 Candy bars.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:46:56 Anything with sugar they sell for an overpriced amount.
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:47:27 How do you buy snacks then lol?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 00:47:45 Does the school digitally send you the ice cream?

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:21:27 Saving doesn't just break.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:22:00 Are you sure you didn't turn on autosave?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:22:16 Because it will just load the build in the autosave slot without the paint.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:22:21 When you join a game.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:22:43 Sure you didn't save it over another slot by accident then?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:23:08 Did you do it in a test server?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:24:01 Hmm... Sounds like a legitimate bug if two people have experienced the same issue, maybe go to <#498473314445033472> and ask someone about it.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:24:34 You're right. You should test it a few times first.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:25:06 <#609442446249820211> Literally just take time and read.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:26:25 > it does say all blocks need to be attached
<@653538164610433045> All that means is that you can't have a random booster on the opposite side of the plot that doesn't take off with the rocket. Of course you can have multi stage rockets as long as they are connected with disconnectors to begin with.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 02:27:06 Why am I answering random questions it's not my job. Goodbye.
