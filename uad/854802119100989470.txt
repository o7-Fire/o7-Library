creations-chat 2021-06-18 03:36:39 aight
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:41:58 hi, this is my wip custom airliner, and the reason for tnt is because i am doing a plane crash movie with this thing

just wanna know it's thoughts so far and see how people like it so far

it's basically a panam livery (but still not panam), with a beach sorta theme, and a 1980's feel to it

and yes i am flying in the air with no wings
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:44:47 i can see that, thank you for the information.

i tried making other designs but they all sucked so i just kept it how it is, but i might see if i can find some in the future

i also have a deadline for this airliner, so that is why it looks so janky so far.

again, thank you for the information, and i will try to make something out of it
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:48:11 i do not like it
creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:50:13 could be more round
