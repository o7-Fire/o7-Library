general 2021-01-19 22:32:48 Was I pinged?
general 2021-01-19 22:33:27 Someone pinged me and I don't know why.
general 2021-01-19 22:33:47 Welp
general 2021-01-19 22:33:55 Guess no one pinged me
general 2021-01-19 22:34:33 I had two pings and I searched for them and no one did.
general 2021-01-19 22:35:15 How would anyone know exactly who I am and ping me?
general 2021-01-19 22:35:20 I'm fairly new
general 2021-01-19 22:35:40 Hm.
general 2021-01-19 22:36:00 So whoever pinged me must have a specific reason to specifically ping me.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:25:39 Who can provide me with an idea or plan to create a vehicle designed to destroy aircraft? I need the vehicle to be able to destroy the common standard fighter jets.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:27:39 I need the device or weapon to be able to ground enemy jets flying above me with ease.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:27:44 Any thoughts?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:28:11 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:28:37 Are they effective?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:28:44 Wow.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:29:23 Thanks.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:29:58 Oh and if I used rope to connect the explosives and act like a net, would it lag?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:30:24 Darn.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 18:30:47 Yea.
creations-chat 2021-01-22 21:50:23 I have a tank that is so heavy that the wheels on it barely move it at all. How can I make it faster? My goal is to eventually make it to where I don’t need rockets to make it move.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:35:27 I think you might like the new models.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:39:03 That will most likely be Mark 48
general 2021-01-23 21:17:07 Why can't I post images in <#384025409945337856>? It wont show the image upload icon.
general 2021-01-23 21:17:50 I mean I've posted creations before..
general 2021-01-23 21:17:54 Is it a new thing?
general 2021-01-23 21:18:32 Ohh
general 2021-01-23 21:18:34 Thanks

general 2021-01-23 21:45:49 .__.
general 2021-01-23 21:46:32 I'm sure it would be nice if he had more developers to help him.
general 2021-01-23 21:48:04 Imagine the development they could accomplish with an entire team.

general 2021-01-25 17:05:28 Can I post gifs of my creation in <#384025409945337856>?
general 2021-01-25 17:05:55 Oh.
general 2021-01-25 17:06:09 Oh okay.
general 2021-02-02 06:11:34 When you build creations to post them in the channel.. Doesn’t it weigh on you? That burden of needing to measure up to others’ expectations? Then your heart sinks when you see how many downvotes you got..
general 2021-02-02 06:12:15 I need a good audience first
general 2021-02-02 06:12:34 Dhfbdubdur
general 2021-02-02 06:12:40 How does that work
general 2021-02-02 06:13:52 I put my heart and soul into a project people seem to ignore it... But others create banana boats and they somehow like it
general 2021-02-02 06:14:09 So I think hey... what of I make a lawn mower... BOOM people like it
general 2021-02-02 06:14:31 Sigh
general 2021-02-02 06:15:05 I assume people are much more judgmental toward serious builds
general 2021-02-02 06:16:12 I’ve been a roblox builder for 7 years.. And I’m not sure what the definition of “good” means anymore
general 2021-02-02 06:17:27 Like for instance, how would I present my build.. How would I design it knowing my audience
general 2021-02-02 06:18:15 ...
general 2021-02-02 06:19:07 It’s just in all my experience I never thought I would see my audience’s expectations so high
general 2021-02-02 06:20:27 And unpredictable that is
general 2021-02-02 06:21:18 Ah
general 2021-02-02 06:22:41 I’m guessing at the start of this server.. The expectations were lower because less people openly shared creations
general 2021-02-02 06:23:02 ...
general 2021-02-02 06:24:49 So where should I aim my goals? Should I swing wide and aim for perfection or should I aim for building original and somewhat unique
general 2021-02-02 06:26:25 Your banana boat is a couple block long piece of plastic
general 2021-02-02 06:26:46 Ah
general 2021-02-02 06:27:15 Confusing at that
general 2021-02-02 06:29:18 So how would I screenshot my build effectively
general 2021-02-02 06:29:49 I’m sure people would be more interested in my build if they had a better, more detailed perspective
general 2021-02-02 06:31:39 Saw what?
general 2021-02-02 06:32:10 You mean the f35 I build in an hour
general 2021-02-02 06:33:25 Yea I didnt expect that one to get a good rating for the design.. I expected the engineering of the cockpit to pass a higher standard
general 2021-02-02 06:33:49 Not funny
general 2021-02-02 06:34:08 But I was thinking small
general 2021-02-02 06:34:21 I engineered more than you can imagine
general 2021-02-02 06:34:23 So yea
general 2021-02-02 06:34:28 Should I think big?
general 2021-02-02 06:34:35 Instead of small?
general 2021-02-02 06:35:04 63 things
general 2021-02-02 06:35:22 But I’m not sure they can all fit in one plot now can they
general 2021-02-02 06:36:25 I’m not good at fighter jets
general 2021-02-02 06:37:09 Motor locks make building a heck of a ton kore complicated than I’m used to
general 2021-02-02 06:38:42 It’s just the comprehending hundreds of motors in one functioning vehicle
general 2021-02-02 06:40:22 Okay
general 2021-02-02 06:42:28 I originally tried to have a code not to use motor locking and rely on my building skills but then when I came to aircraft it just didnt work
general 2021-02-02 06:45:10 So after I build a vehicle.. And I know that it is good.. Fits certain criteria.. Why should I be confident that it will be liked by other people?
general 2021-02-02 06:47:24 Sounds effective..
general 2021-02-02 06:48:06 Thats the only build I took my time on
general 2021-02-02 06:48:13 The others I quickly made
general 2021-02-02 06:48:54 It ripped a shredder bug to pieces
general 2021-02-02 06:49:21 But the other builds I might as well get rid of.. I didnt really take my time on them anyway
general 2021-02-02 06:50:18 Looks amazing
general 2021-02-02 06:51:03 I’ll be building my abrams tank with the advice I’ve been given..
general 2021-02-02 06:51:06 Thanks.
general 2021-02-02 06:52:49 <@!790732709559271444> I hope you know you are my inspiration
general 2021-02-02 06:57:51 So why would a tank need to have motor lock?
general 2021-02-02 07:01:09 Nevermind the density equation is too complex for a roblox game
general 2021-02-02 07:01:26 Anyway I need an angle at 16.7 degrees
general 2021-02-02 07:02:16 Well then I’m in the wrong game
general 2021-02-02 07:04:25 First of all how did you get the turrets to be positioned so that they move.. isnt there supposed to be a 0.9 block space?
general 2021-02-02 07:04:43 Ah
general 2021-02-02 07:04:44 I see
general 2021-02-02 07:05:13 Well I’ll show you what I’ve got so far
general 2021-02-02 07:05:34 Oh?
general 2021-02-02 07:05:46 So it doesnt weld if its motor locked
general 2021-02-02 07:09:07 Lockheed how do you present your battleship without it being overwhelmingly complex to the eye of your audience?
general 2021-02-02 07:23:57 <@!790732709559271444> Look in creations
general 2021-02-02 07:24:00 I tried my best
general 2021-02-02 07:25:33 Like I said
general 2021-02-02 07:25:37 Tried my best
general 2021-02-02 07:26:14 Because I had to motor lock the rockets in the barrel
general 2021-02-02 07:27:07 Wow... This community sucks
general 2021-05-06 02:02:51 sup.
general 2021-05-06 02:27:43 Is t he april fools update still available?
general 2021-05-06 02:27:46 Or not?
