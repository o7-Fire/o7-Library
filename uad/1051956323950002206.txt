general 2023-05-08 22:25:43 ???
general 2023-05-08 22:27:04 Dyno a bitch not gonna lie
general 2023-05-08 22:27:57 This is like 1984 where newspeak eliminates all words of thoughtcrime meaning that speaking against the party is impossible as there is literally zero vocabulary to support it
general 2023-05-08 22:28:18 Literally 1984
the-dump 2023-05-08 22:29:18 Planes movie be like
general 2023-05-08 22:30:14 No but it's literally 1984, this happened in the book
general 2023-05-08 22:30:30 No meme, it happened in the book
general 2023-05-08 22:31:19 Yeah, in 1984 it was said that newspeak was slowly being removed of all words that involved thoughtcrime
general 2023-05-08 22:31:39 You can't say "government bad" because there literally was no word to say government bad
general 2023-05-08 22:31:57 So the new generations would have literally zero ways of speaking against the party

general 2023-05-08 22:36:13 Hell naw that's the funny assassin's creed black flag year
general 2023-05-08 22:36:33 ðŸ˜±
general 2023-05-08 22:36:50 It's the year 1987
general 2023-05-08 22:37:01 Was that the bite of 87?
general 2023-05-08 22:37:30 It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.
general 2023-05-08 22:38:05 The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
general 2023-05-08 22:38:53 Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
general 2023-05-08 22:39:40 Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.
general 2023-05-08 22:39:47 He was malnourished
general 2023-05-08 22:39:57 How would he be fat
general 2023-05-08 22:40:10 Airstrip 1*
general 2023-05-08 22:40:26 Hmm Krill yourself
general 2023-05-08 22:40:38 -the Krill from ice age
general 2023-05-08 22:40:53 Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.
general 2023-05-08 22:41:16 I like the leopard 1, what's wrong with it?
general 2023-05-08 22:41:48 What tank do you like then?
general 2023-05-08 22:41:59 People were born after 2010?
general 2023-05-08 22:42:00 Damn
general 2023-05-08 22:42:16 DAMN

general 2023-05-08 22:42:26 Yep

general 2023-05-08 22:43:05 Jimmy carter
general 2023-05-08 22:43:57 I have many tanks that I like that aren't the leopard 1, I just like how it looks on my profile picture
general 2023-05-08 22:45:04 It seems that in an effort to save your non existent argument about 1984 you try to insult me personally even though I find most German tanks to be garbage
general 2023-05-08 22:45:37 The hubris of this man<:livereaction:1070454290788925621>
general 2023-05-08 22:46:25 Yeah, the tiger tanks were pretty garbage
general 2023-05-08 22:46:32 Tell me something I don't know?
general 2023-05-08 22:46:43 Piss off protogen

general 2023-05-08 22:48:10 I use American tanks??
general 2023-05-08 22:48:20 Literally have no clue what you're talking about
general 2023-05-08 22:49:17 Damn, that's something I actually didn't know, cool fact.
general 2023-05-08 22:49:40 I stopped playing a while ago once I got to the Sherman
general 2023-05-08 22:49:55 It's not really my #1 game
general 2023-05-08 22:50:56 Why are you spamming joy?
general 2023-05-08 22:52:30 I don't understand why you guys are spamming the word joy
creations-chat 2023-05-08 22:54:18 Cringe<:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-08 22:54:56 I see
general 2023-05-08 22:55:38 Small problem
general 2023-05-08 22:55:43 The MP18
general 2023-05-08 22:58:05 That's due to the fact that the bolt action rifle was the main weapon in the German army, why waste 5 rounds on one man at least (most missing at longer ranges) when you can hit a man 200 meters away and kill him in one shot?
general 2023-05-08 22:58:51 How did it go?
general 2023-05-08 22:59:32 I wouldn't say the kar98 was outdated
general 2023-05-08 23:00:16 The UK still used bolt actions, so did the Russians, the Americans and the japanese
general 2023-05-08 23:00:25 1903 springfield
general 2023-05-08 23:00:41 Just because they had a semi auto doesn't mean bolt actions were obsolete
general 2023-05-08 23:01:27 Yes. And the garand didn't last that long did it?
general 2023-05-08 23:01:56 I'm not, I'm saying that bolt actions weren't obsolete in ww2
general 2023-05-08 23:04:03 And the British which fielded mainly bolt actions and also had the most men on the western and African front?
general 2023-05-08 23:05:06 I'm sorry?
general 2023-05-08 23:06:58 African front, battle of Britain, knocking out thousands of German planes, 16 million men on the western front, the most tank kills in France, fighting in the Pacific I can list much more
general 2023-05-08 23:07:13 Then why was it around for several decades?
general 2023-05-08 23:08:06 So?
general 2023-05-08 23:09:20 My brother in Christ, do you know what an enbloc/stripper clip is?
general 2023-05-08 23:09:30 You can literally load a bolt action in half a second
general 2023-05-08 23:11:02 Pretty sure you did. Only weapon that you'd be able to do something like that with would be a sten or something
general 2023-05-08 23:11:15 With its magazine placed at the side
general 2023-05-08 23:14:09 Meaning that logistics has to deliver 3 times more rounds and produce 3 times more rounds
general 2023-05-08 23:17:48 1. No? Have you seen how little time it takes to rack a bolt back and forth?
2. You can grab another en-bloc clip and stick it in taking the same amount of time as a garand
3. A garand lacks the ability to have a scope
4. Pistol
5. Pistol
general 2023-05-08 23:18:33 The Gewehr 43 is a good weapon (in Pavlov, I have not seen how good it is in real life)
general 2023-05-08 23:18:47 I'm not talking about German troops here
general 2023-05-08 23:20:17 Yes. But remember it's not a race to see who can dump more rounds
general 2023-05-08 23:21:14 No, because I'm not a wehraboo like you.
general 2023-05-08 23:21:59 There are more bolt action rifles than the Kar 98.
general 2023-05-08 23:22:20 I was saying that the Kar 98 wasn't outdated seeing how it was a very successful rifle
general 2023-05-08 23:22:23 Like many bolt actions
general 2023-05-08 23:22:39 If bolt actions are outdated then they shouldn't be used in modern conflicts right?
general 2023-05-08 23:22:59 Alright wehraboo
general 2023-05-08 23:23:33 Honestly just sounds like you're getting mad, wehraboo
general 2023-05-08 23:24:12 It's someone who practically idolises Germany and it's armed forces
general 2023-05-08 23:25:15 So I'm idolising something because I think that the Kar 98 isn't garbage?
general 2023-05-08 23:25:20 You're delusional
general 2023-05-08 23:26:29 So it's bad because it was put into a situation where it wasn't made to fight?
general 2023-05-08 23:27:36 And the mosin was made in the 1890s and still serves today, your point?
general 2023-05-08 23:27:53 I don't see STGs or MP40s in service
general 2023-05-08 23:28:02 Or Thompsons or stens
general 2023-05-08 23:28:08 Or ppsh
general 2023-05-08 23:28:29 Congrats, you learnt what a mosin is
general 2023-05-08 23:29:22 The ppsh-41 was made in... '41
general 2023-05-08 23:29:25 Hence the name
general 2023-05-08 23:30:01 I'm not going off track, you're just forgetting when stuff was made
general 2023-05-08 23:30:30 You just said that the ppsh wasn't from ww2
general 2023-05-08 23:30:37 When it was literally made in 1941
general 2023-05-08 23:30:50 Womp womp
general 2023-05-08 23:32:03 The T-55 is in use in Ukraine, your point being exactly?
general 2023-05-08 23:32:14 We already discussed that
general 2023-05-08 23:32:34 They're using old shit in Ukraine, good or bad they're using what they can get
general 2023-05-08 23:32:53 I'm giving an example
general 2023-05-08 23:32:59 Exactly my point
general 2023-05-08 23:33:38 By that logic everything that wasn't a shotgun or a machine pistol was outdated
general 2023-05-08 23:34:11 You can't throw a long range rifle into CQB and expect it to be good
general 2023-05-08 23:34:17 I knew that.
general 2023-05-08 23:34:33 13, why?
general 2023-05-08 23:35:02 Literally do not see an issue with it, I'm old enough to be on the site.
general 2023-05-08 23:35:28 Alright cool, any more facts that you'll pull from Wikipedia?
general 2023-05-08 23:36:13 <a:breakdance:731290867838746714>
general 2023-05-08 23:37:08 Agreed
general 2023-05-08 23:37:38 Oli when the weapon used for long range combat is put into close quarters combat: this weapon bad!!!
general 2023-05-08 23:38:33 Specs and multiplayer
general 2023-05-08 23:38:54 Why does that matter?
general 2023-05-08 23:39:15 Just because it failed in Stalingrad and your operation Barbarossa doesn't mean that bolt actions are outdated
general 2023-05-08 23:39:58 Save yourself the time and don't
general 2023-05-08 23:40:37 Literally spy tf2
general 2023-05-08 23:41:09 Good luck making a ro-scale F16 aka the fighter that you could fit into your pocket
general 2023-05-08 23:41:25 The F16 is a very very small jet
general 2023-05-08 23:43:26 There's a quote from Warhammer 40k that I like "The Legionnaire that scoffs at a lasgun has not charged across an open field against a hundred of them."
general 2023-05-08 23:44:41 So you just admitted that you aren't listening to my points and you're being a hypocrite?
general 2023-05-08 23:44:56 Due to the fact that earlier you said that I wasn't listening?
general 2023-05-08 23:45:57 Yeah
general 2023-05-08 23:46:01 Why is it exactly bad?
general 2023-05-08 23:46:17 Explain.
general 2023-05-08 23:47:00 Yeah
general 2023-05-08 23:47:45 > that just means it was a poor choice for germany to use during the war
<@1074103769253560410>
general 2023-05-08 23:47:55 I saved your message for you
general 2023-05-08 23:48:36 I think oligone has given up and retreated to his incelcave
general 2023-05-08 23:50:13 Oli when the weapon designed to be used at long range in open areas is put into tight spaces in close quarters: this weapon sucks all hail Stalin and his amazing submachineguns this is why communism is the best I hate USA! USSR #1!!!
general 2023-05-08 23:51:39 You just basically told us we can't say you're wrong
general 2023-05-08 23:51:56 So you just admitted that your entire argument was pointless
general 2023-05-08 23:52:05 Yeah
general 2023-05-08 23:52:20 That's like comparing a Vulcan to a matchlock
general 2023-05-08 23:52:43 What is your obsession with 1943?
general 2023-05-08 23:53:36 Because it was stuck in Stalingrad trying to navigate through tight corners
general 2023-05-08 23:54:25 Yep
general 2023-05-08 23:54:49 No?
general 2023-05-08 23:54:59 Pacific and African front would like to have a word
general 2023-05-08 23:55:08 In fact fuck it, Italian front too
general 2023-05-08 23:55:31 Nah the needler is better
general 2023-05-08 23:56:04 The Japanese used bolt actions, and you said ww2 not just Germany meaning that you can still compare
general 2023-05-08 23:56:23 Where they used swords against rifles
general 2023-05-08 23:56:25 Dumbass
general 2023-05-08 23:58:29 You're showing an American rifle Vs a German when you literally changed the subject to the Japanese invasion of China?
general 2023-05-08 23:58:35 Wake up.
general 2023-05-08 23:59:11 Where the US did not see combat in?
general 2023-05-09 00:00:05 Also, the eastern front had more losses
general 2023-05-09 00:00:23 You're saying this like I don't know that
general 2023-05-09 00:00:40 ... what does that have to do with anything?
general 2023-05-09 00:00:59 Japanese rifles were poorly put together and were bad quality
general 2023-05-09 00:01:33 ðŸ¥±
general 2023-05-09 00:02:03 Right because I think that bolt action rifles aren't obsolete?
general 2023-05-09 00:02:16 That makes me specifically a wehraboo?
general 2023-05-09 00:02:40 Even though you praise daddy Stalin's automatic weapons and German machinepistols
general 2023-05-09 00:03:41 Dementia isn't related to short term memory loss but rather a slow deterioration of the mind as more neurons die
general 2023-05-09 00:04:10 Right because the main weapon for every soldier is a submachine gun and definitely not a carbine
general 2023-05-09 00:04:32 Yo dumbass
general 2023-05-09 00:04:56 The M4 is a carbine
general 2023-05-09 00:06:35 The main weapon is the M4.
general 2023-05-09 00:06:52 It's the most common weapon in the US military
general 2023-05-09 00:07:14 It has a barrel length of less than 20 inches making it a carbine
general 2023-05-09 00:08:04 It's official name is the M4 carbine
general 2023-05-09 00:09:09 It's not a dual role dumbass
general 2023-05-09 00:09:54 I already told you I'm 13, Mr dementia
general 2023-05-09 00:09:58 Hypocrite
general 2023-05-09 00:10:40 Says the guy who thinks a weapons worth is based off of their worst moment in service
general 2023-05-09 00:10:57 Oli how old are you?
general 2023-05-09 00:11:02 That's my question
general 2023-05-09 00:11:29 That's a very vague answer
general 2023-05-09 00:11:35 Possibly hiding that you're under age
general 2023-05-09 00:12:28 I'm 13?
general 2023-05-09 00:12:40 Bruh I can literally show proof
general 2023-05-09 00:12:53 I'm literally 13
general 2023-05-09 00:13:00 I have no clue why you think I'm under age
general 2023-05-09 00:13:27 Is it just because you want a Scapegoat to use for your failure in your argument
general 2023-05-09 00:13:44 Because that's a horrible option
general 2023-05-09 00:14:01 If you were blind and deaf then yes, I provided zero points
general 2023-05-09 00:14:16 Yet you said you gave up multiple times and then came back 10 minutes later
general 2023-05-09 00:14:19 Hypocrite
general 2023-05-09 00:14:43 But if you actually went back and read it I brought up many good points
general 2023-05-09 00:14:55 Oli's shenanigans
general 2023-05-09 00:15:36 I've noticed that your typing has gotten worse during this conversation meaning that your hands could be shaking from your crying
general 2023-05-09 00:16:22 A lot of people accuse other people of things that they are currently doing to shift the blame, saying that I'm crying means that you could be crying about this yourself
