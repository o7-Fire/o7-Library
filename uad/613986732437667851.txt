general 2020-11-04 02:38:37 > Isn’t motor lock a bug

If it was a bug then why would there be a “lock” option in the motors and if it was a bug it would’ve been patched by now <@!403843930543882241>
general 2020-11-04 02:39:03 Then why is there a “lock” option

creations-chat 2022-05-25 21:50:20 why do you say that
creations-chat 2022-05-25 21:57:03 is it because of the 2 gaping holes in it, yeah those are to make room for the gyros
motor locking isnt an option for something that needs to stay light weight

and can you expand on "do better" please
creations-chat 2022-05-25 22:03:33 Half block anything is heavy for idk what reason, so putting them all over the place trying to make it look good isnt an option most of the time
creations-chat 2022-05-25 22:07:41 Nope, too heavy. Gyro ships have to be light
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:27:53 some tomfoolery
the-dump 2022-06-22 06:30:53 it forgot how to plane

the-dump 2022-06-24 05:35:56 bullying a tomcat
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:39:21 thanks
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:44:52 alot of people say its op
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:45:34 that works, but gyros ships tend to be super manueverable so they'll just catch up to you
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:46:26 i see
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:50:00 lightweight, well balanced, idk if this helps but not very many wing panels
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:52:04 yep, top speed is around 3.8k-3.9k
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:52:18 
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:52:32 it sure can
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:53:45 control panels?
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:53:52 i dont use control panels
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:53:59 do you mean motor2s?
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:54:13 i dont use a max angle
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:54:33 it depends how much room your gyros have
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:54:42 i have no idea
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:55:41 id say to just move them around and mess around with the angles, until you think they are good or to where they dont phase into other blocks
the-dump 2022-06-24 05:56:17 no problem
the-dump 2022-06-24 06:38:14 motor2s thats how
the-dump 2022-06-24 06:38:19 and hover engines
the-dump 2022-06-24 06:38:26 super rockets work too

the-dump 2022-06-24 08:38:47 For the gyros that is
the-dump 2022-06-24 08:38:57 Gyros are a simple design

creations-chat 2022-07-02 21:02:39 I swear I just saw that in a pvp server
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:13 hover bug at the end though
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:25 average day in pc pvp
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:29:30 yes
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:30:00 I still have yet to get hover bug
the-dump 2022-07-03 06:30:12 yeah that happens to me sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 00:19:46 
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 00:23:03 gyro ships are very easy to kill, one hit pretty much any where and its off balace. yet i disagree with them being easy to kill, very fast and super manueverable.
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 00:24:24 i barely ever see other gyro users, last time i saw a gyro user was some guy in pvp (not including my friend mew2)
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 00:25:31 they are both easy and difficult to kill at the same time, i noticed i contradicted myself there

the-dump 2023-05-08 23:10:09 Maybe later though
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:10:12 Busy rn
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:10:49 Also namnam jets usually result in a stalemate, because i can maneuver well, and so can the jet
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:10:56 Ill dm you
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:11:15 what kind of unholy conglomeration is that
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:11:30 Ah
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:11:34 Fair enough
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:11:47 Whats your top speed
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:11:51 Looks fast
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:12:11 Dang almost as fast as me
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:12:40 That seems like it relys on acceleration
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:13:29 ANO gyro?
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:13:33 Courtesy of januu
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:14:08 Is that more effective than mews gyro?
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:14:27 Ah
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:14:38 Im guessing mews didnt fit
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:14:58 Ohh
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:15:06 oh jeez
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:15:19 Looks like ima be using stealth then
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:15:53 Yeah aerial combat does take a bit to get better at
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:16:28 I need to make a new gyro with this ANO gyro thing
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:16:33 It double as core tech
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:16:43 oh jeez
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:16:46 Thats quite fast
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:16:53 Id have to show you
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:04 Its better than mew gyro
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:11 I still have yet to make a build with it
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:46 Well
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:51 It doesnt control roll
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:55 Pitch and yaw
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:17:58 But yeah
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:02 3 dimensional
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:11 Just on gyro
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:16 One*
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:27 Doesnt need another to counter it like mews
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:34 ?
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:18:48 Is that your gyro
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:19:02 Looks different than ones i see
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:19:03 Ah
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:19:28 Also me being “busy”
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:19:33 Is im waiting for a haircut
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:20:06 I havent had one in like over a month
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:20:11 But its not my money

the-dump 2023-05-08 23:20:51 4 months
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:20:57 Mine grows fast
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:21:11 Did you balance your build better since last time
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:21:45 Balance doesnt matter all that much, that is if you dont mind your back swinging after a hard manuever
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:22:34 Wym cant use it in third person
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:22:42 Jee
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:22:43 z
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:22:50 my new gyro is like 450
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:00 It has motor lock but its in the center
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:15 I dont think i have a video of it on my phone
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:17 Or any
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:36 But i took the chassis of my old fart22
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:42 And made it gyro
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:46 Nope
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:23:54 Shortened the nose too
the-dump 2023-05-08 23:24:15 Its not the prettiest but it performs the best
