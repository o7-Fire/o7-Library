plane-crazy 2021-03-06 00:56:31 I tried to build on mobile but the crappy system is pure hell to work with
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:31:03 Why is plane crazy mobile using a crosshair tap building system instead of something like build a boat, where you can tap in any location and they give you the option to press a checkmark to place blocks.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:31:55 PC = Plane crazy
Mobile = build a boat
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:32:13 It depends on devices basically
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:32:43 On PC it’s definitely plane crazy but mobile plane crazy is unplayable because of the awful plane controls and building controls.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:33:37 What good are blocks if you can’t even place them properly - Mobile
Of course if you have PC, it’s plane crazy 100%
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:34:33 Is this a similar situation to bad business where the creator can easily implement a better mobile system but chooses not to just to screw over mobile players and discriminate against them?
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:35:23 Like m8, not everyone has money needed for a working pc or even laptop.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:36:16 I tried fighting with cannons but the bullet velocity is pure crap.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:38:37 Oh yeah umm, what are shredders? I joined plane crazy only a couple days ago and haven’t played much because of the crap mobile system.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:41:19 Oh so basically homing missiles with giant saws
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:41:27 That’s hell
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:41:56 Yeah I watched a video of them in action and they ruin lives lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:42:32 Imagine a plane that can launch shredders like missiles
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:42:39 That’s a yikes from me
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:46:21 I was thinking about an EMP system that disables vehicles but then that would just get abused instead.

plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:53:04 Is there any possible way to alter the building system on mobile right now or are we doomed?
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 04:53:40 The current mobile building system where there’s a crosshair and you have to double tap to place blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 15:10:58 Has anyone built one of those CL 1201 aerial aircraft carriers with like 20 microfighters on its wings?
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 15:11:21 OH THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 15:11:54 CL-1201 flying aircraft carriers but instead of microfighters on its wings, it’s 20 shredders.
the-dump 2021-03-06 15:17:16 Basically: Groza
the-dump 2021-03-06 15:17:33 props for actually knowing how bullpups work
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 17:02:40 Everyone’s here with complex and cool planes while I’m just stuck with a half assed starter plane.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:25:25 I would love to see someone make a star wars stealth fighter but based off of modern stealth designs instead of satellites and 3rd gen fighters.
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 21:25:52 Like an F-22 with hyperdrive and space thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 22:09:45 I would build it myself but I am screwed over by the developers refusal to give mobile players proper controls.
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 17:29:49 How did you get the up down left right controls?
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 19:55:34 I only have w s and g
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 20:01:13 yeah I’m on mobile
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 20:03:20 Anyways, imagine this: You’ve just built a F-22 and when you tried to fly in pvp, you’re immediately engaged by a bunch of shredders. Little do they know, you’ve loaded your jet with hundreds of bombs. The shredders mad the fatal mistake of flying right below you and you drop hell on them: Hundreds of missiles and tnt blasts them into pieces.
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 20:03:30 Yeah thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:16:54 Since the AN-225 is so large, I would love to see someone build an AN-225 aircraft carrier. Basically it’s an AN-225 but with a redesigned interior built to fit up to maybe like 5 or 7 F-35 or F-16.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:17:35 There were 747 aircraft carriers before but they had to have mini fighters
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:18:12 I don’t really know any russian small fighters besides 3rd gen ones so I had to compromise
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:18:23 I mean you could also use the C-5
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:19:13 Or you can take an SU-57 but cut it’s wing span
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 13:19:23 But that means slower takeoff
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:45:55 Okay so I got the hang of the controls on mobile and it’s 10x better than build a boat controls, albeit it’s a lot more complex to set up the controls.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:46:05 But once you get the controls down, it’s totally worth it
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:46:15 Now my only issue is the damn building system which sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:46:53 Both have planes and both are building games
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:47:08 Also once you get enough materials, you don’t build boats
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:47:50 Anyways, build a boat has a perfect mobile building system: click on an area and then click on a green checkmark to place
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:48:12 It’s better than the crosshair system of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:50:06 Did you not read what I said? “I don’t know any small russian fighters besides 3rd gen ones so I had to compromise.”
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:50:45 Besides, this is a game with zero real life lore so anything is possible.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:57:54 Uhhhh because a device needs time to render a lot of blocks.........
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:58:23 Yeah and that happens in every game
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:58:26 it’s normal lag
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 17:59:16 The more a pc or mobile device has to render, the more lag there is. Since a large build has a lot of blocks for these devices to take in, the device lags and freezes.
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:01:05 Someone make a 737 max that nosedives every 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-03-08 19:19:17 How do you make suggestions?
bot-central 2021-03-08 19:21:04 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 17:49:35 Alright I’m starting to get the hang of the building system
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 19:18:17 The creators were drunk when they made the mobile building system, I can’t even place blocks on top of each other or do many of the important things needed to make a good build. This game is a moronic joke on mobile, I’m just gonna stay with build a boat because atleast their creators are competent and know what they’re doing.
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 23:09:49 Okay I need to say something: I’m very very VERY sorry. Yesterday I blindly attacked the devs for Plane Crazy’s mobile building system and now I feel awful for it. I should’ve tested the features more before saying anything which I unfortunately didn’t. I’m very severely sorry to the devs I insulted and I will try not to do this again.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 01:36:59 I tried installing hoverdrive into my tutorial F-22 but the lag prevents me from getting very fast by wobbling.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:33:47 Well you gotta blacklist everyone now.

plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:54:55 Would you call a bird a vtol?
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:59:20 Anyone made a coleoptere?
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:59:34 That weird french thingy
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:59:38 search it up
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:59:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 14:59:55 The flying washing machine
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:00:35 oh people have made it before
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:01:07 The coleoptere benefits a lot from parachutes.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:01:43 Of course nowadays things like the Harrier and F-35B are less complex and a lot more effective.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:05:22 Gjsolo 64 used missiles to easily down shredders.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:15:44 Super cool 5th gen F/A-18 from a youtube thumbnail, new building idea for everyone.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:19:01 has anyone made an F/A-181?
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:20:03 plane crazy is good because you can build ridiculous plane concepts that have never been made.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:21:10 like a gunship version of the B-52, a C-5 galaxy aircraft carrier that carries minifighters, and stealth 5th gen versions of 4th gen jets.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:21:47 I’m a noob builder so this is really for the more skilled ones.
general 2021-03-11 15:44:36 **what’s so funny about sussus amogus?**
**it’s a joke name sir**
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:50:20 Imagine you’re in an intense dogfight against a shredder and your plane just constantly screams “over-g over-g over-g” at your face.
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 15:52:55 <:empty:794431705070174238> oh boy trollge
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 16:06:21 should fuel tanks explode when damaged?
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 16:30:36 F-35s can drop nukes apparently.
the-dump 2021-03-11 16:34:13 ඞ uh oh
the-dump 2021-03-11 16:34:40 It’s corrupt like the chinese govern- **gets shot**
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 17:48:26 A kind of beyond visual range missile would be cool.
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 18:39:01 Besides, shredders get dismantled by missiles quite easily


if you know how to aim (I don’t)
plane-crazy 2021-03-13 15:40:35 Has anyone done an angel shaped flare display before?
the-dump 2021-03-14 03:09:00 F-22A powered by the fucking sun.
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:14:01 Has anyone made the survive a plane crash free model plane?
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:15:53 It would be easy..... except for the fact you’re gonna need to motorlock it.
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:16:43 Yeah this thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:17:31 I mean the folding thing
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:17:41 Because the build space is smol
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:18:26 If you have good aim and missiles, shredders generally avoid you, but that’s a lot harder with this game.
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 17:18:41 also nice A-10
plane-crazy 2021-03-16 19:04:21 Nice SU-57
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 00:57:25 What..... is...... this......
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 01:00:04 Man gta loves mixing things
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 01:00:51 I never thought I would see a 3rd gen fighter mixed with a 5th gen.
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 01:01:45 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 12:33:11 F-22 gun doors = Jack in a box with a gun

**yes**
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 22:54:14 All I’m saying is that I can’t build in plane crazy but I can in the other,
also is there an off topic channel?
general 2021-03-17 23:17:04 Build a boat YF-23: Because I can’t build properly in plane crazy without using tutorials.
general 2021-03-17 23:17:43 Yeah micro blocks is easy
general 2021-03-17 23:18:23 **You should see what I have built before microblocks**

general 2021-03-18 19:33:19 This is straight up hacker levels of game breaking
general 2021-03-29 02:34:49 I just saw some kids on youtube who said the F-36 Kingsnake(basically a stealthy modernized F-16XL, which in turn looks like a J-35 Draken), is a copy of the SU-57.

This is why Karen’s shouldn’t have kids.
general 2021-03-29 02:35:37 I just lost a few brain cells from it nothing much.
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 15:14:38 build a plane for treasure......
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 00:43:03 Is it possible to incorporate hypersonic hoverdrive or conveyor drive into a missile in this game?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 00:43:21 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 02:02:59 New missile added to plane crazy! The Project Pluto SLAM.
It’ll kill you by flying near you, it’ll kill you by flying over you, it’ll kill you by blowing you up, and if that don’t work, it’ll kill you by SLAMming into you.
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 02:03:08 (obviously not added)
general 2021-04-09 02:32:25 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pluto Hey guys look at this totally humane and cool thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:20:58 Should I stop playing plane crazy? I literally can’t make anything cool without tutorials or instructions because my pea brain doesn’t understand the building system and the blocks very well.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:21:42 I feel like one of those israeli factories making american jets
general 2021-04-13 14:55:44 a mole goose

plane-crazy 2021-04-14 15:17:05 anyone wanna make the pratt and whitney 747 but with 2 jet engines on opposite sides of the head instead of one? Oh yeah and call it shrek
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 21:57:04 The F-35 has a dome like camera under its nose so yeah there’s a new feature to add to your 5th gen fighter builds.
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 14:02:45 should plane crazy have radar?
general 2021-04-18 02:03:54 Wait a minute

general 2021-04-22 21:52:38 What...... is...... this......
general 2021-04-22 21:53:51 Btw that was one of the aircraft designs submitted into the Advanced Tactical fighter program, yes, the same program that the F-22 was born from.
general 2021-04-22 21:54:58 Of course it was rejected because that design was over 100 feet long in length and I think used ramjets which would’ve massively increased maintenance costs.
general 2021-04-22 21:55:49 Atleast with the other aircraft they weren’t the length of a argentinosaurus..

general 2021-05-01 13:02:02 lol putin wants to turn a TU-160 into a VIP transport.
general 2021-05-01 13:02:24 It’s basically gonna be the TU-144 but more comfortable.
general 2021-05-01 13:02:47 yee dababy
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 22:02:54 A couple years ago, a pilot became unconscious from G forces while flying an F-16. The jet then went into a nosedive and the pilot was only saved by a computer system within the jet that automatically pulled the nose upwards and returned the jet to normal flight long enough for the pilot to wake up and take control of the F-16 again. 

Anyone wanna recreate that in Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 22:03:24 That reminds me of that allosaurus that got its jaw snapped by a diplodocus tail.

plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:32:11 Is it possible to make kamikaze explosive shredder drone swarms in this game?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:32:40 Imagine a pvp player who can launch these things like missiles.....
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:33:05 Heck the real airforce already has kamikaze drones.
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 23:33:33 And want fighter aircraft to launch small ones to swarm enemy fighters and make it even harder to dogfight.
general 2021-05-11 20:54:27 hey guys there’s a fighter called the F-86F-35, what do you guys think of the name?
general 2021-05-11 21:52:58 Yes I’m about as confused as you are on the name.
general 2021-05-11 22:01:54 Imagine an A-10 with a howitzer in its nose instead of the GAU-8 avenger lol.
general 2021-05-11 22:03:18 The closest thing to what I said is this:
ME262 with 50mm cannon
general 2021-05-11 22:03:43 It’s from war thunder
general 2021-05-11 22:04:07 Yeah something like the AC-130 uses 105mm cannons but that’s not a fighter

general 2021-05-28 19:09:17 This iranian F-5 looks kinda hornet-ish
general 2021-05-28 19:10:20 raise the wings and horizontal stabilizer, give it a leading edge root extension in front of the air intakes and it looks very hornet like.
general 2021-05-28 19:10:38 It also has the very long nose like the hornet
general 2021-05-28 19:11:08 Maybe the US didn’t abandon the F-5 to just a trainer role

general 2021-07-21 01:20:19 Make this lol
general 2021-07-21 01:21:05 Yeah basically that but 100x more impractical and costly
general 2021-07-21 01:23:00 Yeah but having only 1 powered segment towing a lot of unpowered segments seriously screws over power to mass ratio. Basically you have a slow vehicle that requires a lot of fuel to get somewhere so still pretty impractical.
general 2021-07-21 01:23:22 yes
general 2021-07-21 01:23:31 and parts wear out faster too because of mass

general 2021-07-21 23:11:57 Off-topic but: Since pulse detonation jets sounds like gunfire, a hypersonic pulse detonation missile that fires 6600 pulses per minute would be terrifying for any enemy aircraft. Just imagine hearing what sounds like an M61A2 vulcan rotary cannon firing in the distance, but the sound keeps getting louder and louder until you hear a big BOOM! And your aircraft has been disintegrated.
Too bad pulse detonation propelled missiles are still nothing more than a concept.
And scramjets are stealing all the glory.
general 2021-07-21 23:12:45 Pulse detonation sounds much more intimidating
general 2021-07-21 23:14:36 Oh yeah the V1 was pretty scary

general 2021-07-21 23:15:41 Intimidation 100
general 2021-07-21 23:16:33 Yeah the canopy blocks out sound but hopefully the pulse detonations would be loud enough. Actually it would probably sound more terrifying since the detonations would sound like someone’s banging on their canopy.
general 2021-07-21 23:16:47 Or just heavy rain fall
general 2021-07-21 23:17:31 Now imagine a pulse detonation missile that sounds like that

general 2021-07-24 02:51:11 Aurora was a rumored mid-1980s American reconnaissance aircraft. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a myth.

The U.S. government has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site Aerospaceweb.org concluded, "The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government's position."

Former Skunk Works director Ben Rich confirmed that "Aurora" was simply a myth in Skunk Works (1994), a book detailing his days as the director. Rich wrote that a colonel working in the Pentagon arbitrarily assigned the name "Aurora" to the funding for the B-2 bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.

Others come to different conclusions. In 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, "Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago."

general 2021-08-09 02:54:34 I think the problem I have with learning how to drive a car is situational awareness. Yeah I have a rear camera that easily tells me how far I can back my future car before I hit something. But Idk if I can tell the same for the front of my future car.
general 2021-08-09 02:55:10 I will have to like, REALLY extend my neck to see the bumper of my car to REALLY make sure I don’t hit anything.

general 2021-08-14 23:16:44 Against a modern aircraft, it could change the trajectory of the aircraft trying to kamikaze since all control systems would fail, the pilot would die, and the aircraft would likely spin out of control and fall somewhere harmless.
general 2021-08-14 23:17:41 But since they’re explosive rounds, it would take off probably both wings and explode the fuel tanks.
general 2021-08-14 23:17:55 CIWS is aimbot
general 2021-08-14 23:18:16 Oh wait there’s already surface to air missiles.
general 2021-08-14 23:19:12 Ships can be loaded with more missiles than planes so that’s gonna give any kamikaze aircraft the true TouHou experience.
general 2021-08-14 23:19:43 Except instead of losing you just get disintegrated by the probably 30 missiles fired at you.
general 2021-08-14 23:20:35 Yes electronic warfare
general 2021-08-14 23:20:49 Hack the aircraft and make it kamikaze its teammates B)
general 2021-08-14 23:21:50 Oh my god he’s a mother and he’s gay?
general 2021-08-14 23:21:58 Bruhhhhhhh
general 2021-08-15 01:33:02 This graph is more inaccurate than a phantom forces serbu shotgun with a suppressor and birdshot. And has basically been disproven to death at this point.
general 2021-08-15 01:33:24 Yet so many people use it for information……… why?
creations-chat 2021-08-15 01:38:12 nice
the-dump 2021-08-16 22:13:41 It looks hot in there
general 2021-08-16 22:25:41 Wait….. are afterburners technically just really big stoves placed inside turbine engines? From the looks of images, that seems to be the case.
general 2021-08-16 22:26:27 Although idk if the sound of the afterburners turning on is similar to the sound of a stove turning on. Maybe it is but you can’t hear it because of the engine making a lot of noise.
general 2021-08-16 22:37:31 Don’t they also put a flame into the back of the engine to ignite the fuel? Or do the oxygen do that by themselves?
the-dump 2021-08-16 23:01:08 Oh boy that movie won’t get released until we have 6th gen fighters.
general 2021-08-19 16:17:17 Is it possible to blend the horizontal stabilizer of an aircraft into the wing like this?
(Bad editing)
general 2021-08-22 02:53:47 Is it possible to recreate this in plane crazy?
general 2021-08-22 02:56:11 Atleast it looks better than this tutorial thing, but yeah I suck at building.
general 2021-08-22 02:58:42 I mean…… it’s a tutorial so yeah.
general 2021-08-22 02:59:32 I’ve eaten plain bread several days in a row before. It’s not that bad depending on the type of bread.
general 2021-08-24 01:10:59 hello
general 2021-08-24 18:46:32 Imma start a flame war:
F-15 = Ugli
B)
general 2021-08-24 18:47:18 idk
general 2021-08-25 21:40:16 Gripen Fanboys are weird man, you can outright state that their aircraft superior in a comparison against another aircraft and they still won’t be satisfied. For example, in a Gripen vs F-16 comparison video, I commented that the F-16 only exceeds the gripen in one metric. But apparently 1 metric is too much for Gripen fanboys to handle and quickly a bunch of gripen fanboys flipped their crap on me.
general 2021-08-25 21:41:23 I don’t even think the sukhoi fans are this toxic.
general 2021-08-25 22:47:39 Wait I have a question: Is it okay to recreate someones plane crazy build in build a boat using micro blocks n stuff?
general 2021-08-25 22:49:02 Yeah gold bars
general 2021-08-25 22:49:03 mone
general 2021-08-26 16:54:26 The J-10 and Gripen have similar canard and delta wing placement, what does this say about the aerodynamics of the J-10?
general 2021-08-26 16:54:55 Also the J-10 looks like a pen
general 2021-08-26 16:58:14 Atleast I have a mom
general 2021-08-26 16:58:20 B)
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 16:59:58 Is it possible to build a system that pushes the shells to the loader?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:00:11 Maybe a conveyor or smth
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:00:36 Not really you still have to manually pick up the shells with the loader
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:00:44 That magnet thingy
creations-chat 2021-08-26 17:03:58 <@!766239281236148224> Your turboprop landing kinda reminds me of arrested wire landing on an aircraft carrier.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:05:28 <@!257624380291547146> Are the shells launched using magnets or something else?
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:05:45 Oh so it’s kind of like a railgun
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:05:54 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:06:17 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:06:53 If only there was an explosive block that deflagrated instead of detonating.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:07:21 Deflagration won’t damage the cannon.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:07:28 Subsonic explosion
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:08:30 Although speaking of explosions, I kinda wanna know if it’s possible to make a pulse wave detonation engine that launches and flies an aircraft with explosions.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:08:48 Irl it’s possible and it sounds like a rotary cannon firing
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:09:30 You’re the nose gear
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:10:01 Snowflake roblox moderators are about to come after you.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:10:03 Be prepared
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:10:43 Roblox moderation hiring sucks but roblox cares about money too much to fix it.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:11:21 They hire either offended 14 year olds or religious extremists to moderate the website which means a lot of false banning.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:11:54 The religious extremist part is probably why the word gay is banned.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:12:50 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:14:19 You know normally I don’t support very strict hiring requirements but roblox moderation desperately needs stricter requirements.
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:16:08 Oh god since most moderators are from india and 50% of the indian population are against lgbt, yeah you see the picture.
general 2021-08-26 20:30:42 If war thunder ever gets an A-10, it should be an A-10A since that was the 70s version. Oh yeah and paint it in a dark green color.
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 00:19:49 Yo, is it possible to recreate this in plane crazy? The explosions are pretty big: https://youtu.be/2D_zHRakOXY
the-dump 2021-08-27 00:24:15 What happened afterwards?
general 2021-08-28 13:24:57 70s concept art for some soviet aircraft……. hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 13:30:44 Better than anything I could ever make.
general 2021-08-29 01:13:49 Oh boy me too! But my skin was kinda white when I was born but since I lived in a village, didn’t have internet for a long time, and liked going out in that village, my skin gradually turned darker. My skin is now a yellowish brownish colour.

general 2021-10-13 22:11:56 Is more than one moose called meese?

general 2021-11-24 00:54:26 Yo guys can an A6M zero be turned into a 5th gen stealth fighter?
the-dump 2021-11-24 00:58:20 …………. what?
the-dump 2021-11-24 01:06:37 Alright I’m gonna believe him and turn my little red ferrari into a fully operational hypercar.
the-dump 2021-11-24 01:07:01 Because that’s basically what he’s implying.
the-dump 2021-11-24 01:11:09 He didn’t even say jet engine spitfire or turboprop spitfire. Just straight up said it can be a 5th gen stealth fighter.
the-dump 2021-11-24 01:11:49 He also said that the A6M zero should be classified even though it’s over 80 years old and many better fighters already exists.
general 2022-02-14 21:14:01 Yoooo what if the US invaded Canada tomorrow?
