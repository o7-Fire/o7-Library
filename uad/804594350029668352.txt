plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:35:15 Could somebody help me out?
I was trying to build a dragster from a tutorial and I did it exactly like they did, but for some reason the front wheels don't connect and the engine flies off when I try to drive.
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:35:25 I have screenshots of the build if anybody wants me to dm them
