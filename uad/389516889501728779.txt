creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:36:57 I got my eyes on u
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:36:59 not cool
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:39:29 A ight, and if u did make this originally ima have beef with other ppl that i know
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:40:27 bc thats the jet the plane crazy blue angels used early this year as a trainee jet and as the origional jet for the promo vid
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:41:42 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:41:51 thats not an f18
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:00 looks more like a jet inspired by the f22
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:07 also thats my character in the jet
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:33 i literally screenshotted a vid i had for hat pic
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:53 it also uses darker colors than yours
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:42:59 and has a higher top speed
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:44:03 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:44:26 my avatar
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:45:16 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:46:28 short clip from where i took the screen shot
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:08 but
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:13 u copied it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:14 not cool
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:47:47 ._.
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:48:28 so your just just so happens to have a very similar shape, exact wing design, and color pattern by coincidence
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:49:09 but that is a fictional jet
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:49:20 literally no jet the blue angels used look anything like that
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:50:50 Ight then why do you also have wings behind the pilot seat where the half blocks are?
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:51:15 thats not a normal thing a jet irl would use, and was a thing we did to improve pitch
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:52:08 bc thats too similar for it to not be a blatant copy
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:53:13 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/739438161708580926
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:53:31 
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:53:47 If you look at his photos it was recent as he doesnt have outlines, and my vid was from the winter update and when outlines existed
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:54:17 and if u look up plane crazy blue angels, the first video showcased those jets allowing y to find a place to copy it
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:55:20 the build credit goes to bigexplosivecake as he made the jet for the blue angels
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:10 no
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:17 we didnt make a yt vid bc it could leak
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:56:29 it was a jet used by the blue anegls group for training
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:57:22 ight my case is done
creations-chat 2020-08-02 23:57:27 ima dip now
creations-chat 2020-08-03 00:12:36 problem is that the jet i posted isnt based off the f18, or any blue angels jet, nor does any jet have the **exact same** stripe pattern as the one posted, and Tyler is trying to pass it off as an f18 when it was a copy
creations-chat 2020-08-03 00:12:53 a ight

So i unfold it and begin moving out the way of the other plots, but this dude instant black lists me for having my wing over him for 5 seconds, and i tell him to unlist me so i can load my plane properly. no response, so i make a yeet machine to get me into their plot so they can unlist me and now hes reporting me for getting into his plot so that i can get him to unlist me so i can load my frickin plane. *bruh momento*
general 2020-09-03 03:13:53 this is the folding process for reference

creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:29:13 no
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:32:42 people assume that control surfaces have limited movement, and they cant handle the look of cheese graders on wings
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:35:18 motor locking wings adds hella drag that i dont want, can cause lag, and glitched mouse can have as much control as wasd if you tune it right, with the benefit of not looking like its spazzing out every time you turn
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:38:19 motor 2 mouse is more painful because you have to have a locked camera, doesnt allow for 360 views or easy rolls and is a point of failure in pvp
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:40:33 *is keeping up with a WASD conveyor jet in my glitched mouse hover drive jet* - they can have the same maneuverability, but with mouse you can change the pitch at the moment, wasd you have to spam the key if you want to change pitch
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:44:22 thats a lot of wobble, and having to toggle just to remain stable in flight adds another unnecessary complexity to flying

creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:52:23 control surfaces have as much drag as a normal wing does, so dont make a jet with massive wings and youll be fine
Im still capable of hitting some pretty nice speeds with the power of cheese graders and without a conveyor to yeet me into infinity and beyond

creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:48:58 Z, in most cases this is true, even for my old mig, **but you can look at this shit block for block and it is the same build but with a different camo, and no way in hell is he gonna say that weapon loadout is his bc ive only seen destroyer use it and imo that gun placement is ass**
creations-chat 2021-05-09 20:52:56 ***the avionics are the same with the slight cheese grater for roll and the lowered elevators for pitch, which the rewl mig29 doesnt have as it is leveled with the wings, so thats 110% a copy caught on 4k***
creations-chat 2021-05-09 21:03:39 Screw copiers theyre the scum of this game, even worse than shredder users
creations-chat 2021-05-09 21:06:32 No cap i deal with 5 of those mfs every week, and if they dont take the easy way out of just deleting my jet **because i joined their game and told them to**, then my toxic discord members will make the game a living hell for them until they delete the jet <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

creations-chat 2021-05-09 21:43:09 I mean if ur doing a glitched mouse fighter then yah, if ur doing a flecks build for the looks then do whatever floats ur boat
creations-chat 2021-05-09 22:00:00 Seeing its ur first and that its not a tutorial, id day its nice 👍
creations-chat 2021-05-10 01:29:31 I am jealous, weapon looks out of place tho but ima assume its a WIP

plane-crazy 2021-05-10 12:27:50 Idk what the appeal of my dragon fighter is to so many noobs, its a literal frickin weaponized dorito
creations-chat 2021-05-12 12:13:52 That’s supposed to be a harrier??? <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
creations-chat 2021-05-12 12:21:08 Compared the gun placement to the harrier, so idk my guy i hope its custom
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:24:10 😳
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:38:30 i used the official Iranian camo colors xd
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:43:40 yeah im not gonna go out of my way to get the fancy angles like u got, my planes are built built for pvp not for being show pieces
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:47:17 i used hella locc, and also based the camo placement off of this photo

creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:53:45 adding angles adds weight and takes engine space, i dun like either of those
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:56:01 how does doing more motor locking reduce weight
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:58:13 that adds drag, even worse than weight

<@!694009880507580528> that produces lag, the worst of them all

creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:44:00 Needed for swing wing, id need to cut into the jet to get rid of the gap
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 15:45:22 Idk how to piston lock, dont feel like learning it rn, and dont know how laggy it might be

creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:26:07 I get beaten to death every time i post a new jet i made all because i used cheese grater wings on them <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:28:09 Cheese graters are my religion, hiding them is denying my faith

also motor locking them will either add drag or lag, or even worse will have exposed motor locc
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:30:11 Drag
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:33:40 Lies, literally cutting out 5 wings from an aircraft can boost its top speed by over 100 sps, adding more will cause it to slow down, and more wings **does not** equal more stability, longer aircraft are more stable and funny engines can also make aircraft more stable

Plus theres the space needed to hide the motor locc which is space that can be used for more engines and or weapons, and the risk of lag for having blocks clip into each other
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:35:45 Skill issue

<@!711009848438947850> stacking hover drives causes cancer
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:41:51 Safe to say my laptop is powerful enough to handle a near 3k sps fighter

But motor locking hover pads into each other causes the damn thing to lag to hell and back, ive tested it and its not worth the posible speed boost you can get from it
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:45:02 Stfu vtol engineer II, i make pvp jets not scaled model jets that fly like shit
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:47:09 I know
creations-chat 2021-05-23 22:49:09 But is it meta pvp jet well?
creations-chat 2021-05-24 00:06:31 Werent you arguing with me about how i should cover up my wings and make my builds look good but then have that <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:16:35 Its a weaponized traffic come, and stupid kids love it bc its the a tube with triangles that can dominate a pvp server if built correctly, but half of them screw it up every time  <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:43:13 Thye have jealousy and wish to have a good build without putting in the effort
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:45:12 Guides are better
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:45:33 Most mfs making a tutorial build dont learn what does what
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:45:39 They just mindlessly place blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:46:06 Thats just bombing practice <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:46:44 No
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:47:11 Most tutorial users are young, and they usually never put in the time to learn
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:48:06 Bc he teaches his technique, besides that one time he became a bitch and made a tutorial for his sweaty fans <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:48:23 And now ur mature enough to not use tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 22:48:40 Good, it sucks and even he admits it

events-chat 2022-01-16 20:25:07 Mech battles tend to be uninteresting bc theres little skill involved, and the controls for most mechs are too basic to make for an interesting fight
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:26:38 Plus theres the fact that most mechs in this battle would be modded tutorials or complete crap <:empty:794431705070174238>

events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:23 From what ive seen in public pvp, u literally just fly up to the other guy and swing first to win, or shoot ur rockets first, and these battles end in seconds

Not much opportunities to counter attack or effectively dodge
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:40 What everyone wants
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:02 Battle bot fights mimic irl battle bot fights, plus some bots can take multiple hits and its easier to dodge with them than most mechs in pain crazy

events-chat 2022-01-16 21:27:59 By eliminating a mechs ability to fly, this battle is gonna be even worse

Mfs gonna be slow as hell, have 0 chance to dodge, and bc theres no explosive blocks allowed there is basically no armor to defend against attacks

Legit gonna be 2 stick figures baby walking to each other and randomly swinging swords until a lucky hit is made that kills the other mech

events-chat 2022-01-18 06:33:40 Bring tank battles?

Tank battles tend to be quick, and depending on the performance of the tanks is either as boring as a snail gun fight or is as entertaining as an fps shooter

Planes are fun at all speeds as long as the maneuverability is there along it, and imo requires the most skill to be able to outmaneuver an enemy and score a killing blow

events-chat 2022-01-29 21:42:24 ive done a blimp battle before (and won <:trollface:775024642104229898>) and all it is are slower planes with turrets and low gravity, or mini space ships 

its fun but planes, although less unique to this game, are more fun

events-chat 2022-01-29 21:46:31 not a matter of aim, its a matter of u gotta hold guns for at least 10 seconds on a small maneuverable target to deal enough damage to disable a plane unless the enemy plane is motor locked out the wazoo

events-chat 2022-01-31 12:10:42 <@!757565064998944819> are you illiterate?
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:20:10 Not really, its simply unlocking the limitations of what normal mouse is capable of

Main pilot seat prevents the plane from full rotations when moved, and by removing it from the build via disconnectors to comply with the rules of this event then the seat would never move, allowing for full degrees of rotation

So its more an abuse of the games mechanics than it is a glitch
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:21:36 Hover engines suck at low speeds, and weather they are a glitch or not is difficult bc they work by pushing against blocks and you simply have to have a “lose” block on a build to push against
events-chat 2022-01-31 12:22:40 Ur better off switching to rockets bc if u shoot straight up you will lose a lot of speed, while rockets would not

events-chat 2022-02-08 04:54:25 bc rbk always wins
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:56:06 considering that these planes are basically made of paper mache, speed is the only thing that will keep u alive
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:57:57 Shoot this block and the bi plane will lose its top wings and lose its flight characteristics
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:58:14 Shoot the landing gear and this plane is dead
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:58:51 Doof is most durable, 3 wings attached to the fuselage, and its the fastest so its harder to hit to begin with
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:59:39 and with some basic mods the doof can be very maneuverable
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:00:01 even more reason why the doof is the most survivable plane
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:00:40 no, u chose whatever u want, glitch mouse will allow the plane to do the bs in that vid
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:01:44 doof also has 2 engines, so if one gets yeeted ur still fine
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:02:01 lmao rip

events-chat 2022-02-17 02:23:42 Ive seen people blend normal mouse and glitched mouse, very complicated to pull off tho
events-chat 2022-02-17 02:31:21 Normal mouse is best for low speed combat, but struggles with stability and maneuverability with high speed

Glitched mouse is alright with low speed but dominates mid and high speed

And by attaching an anchored motor rig to ur main pilot seat you can switch between normal and glitched, but its hard to manage and makes it easier to destroy the main pilot seat xd

events-chat 2022-02-23 04:59:16 i have armor on my build, and motor locking blocks into each other doesnt make it "stronger" bc explosives have splash damage no matter what, and bullets go through everything like butter

only armor block resistant to both bullets and rockets are tnt blocks
events-chat 2022-02-23 04:59:43 the armor im using is explosive resistant but not bullet resistant, i wont say what block it is tho <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:24:27 literally <:empty:794431705070174238> 

like look at boxness planes, they are sexy af but can barely fly without giving his pc a heart attack

and i dont wanna make a "good" looking plane if it means i cant actually use it like a plane
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:29:48 asthetically id hide motor locc, fix the spine and make the engines larger bc the mig 25 has giant engines

other than that it looks like ur not using glitched mouse so idk how to make it better for pvp
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:32:22 sexiest pvp plane ever 😍
creations-chat 2022-03-05 19:41:19 idk how to fix engine

back of the spine looks goofy and i think some pontoon would fix it but idk

events-chat 2022-05-04 17:42:40 Cutters cut the moment they touch shit, and they longer they touch the more damage they do
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:43:49 So a saw would have higher dps as it has more chances to touch the enemy, but that doesnt mean that chompers cant be as deadly, you just need to get a hold of the other guy to be able to deal the same dps

creations-chat 2022-06-03 00:40:38 i can just look at boxnesses or vulpens planes if i wanna look at a pretty build

those types of builds take forever to make, take forever to set up, and are never fun to use because of how heavy/laggy they are

also WASD controls are cringe <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2022-06-03 00:46:49 yeah and im getting my point across too, i dont care about making a jet look "perfect" if it means not being fun to fly

making such a build is a labor of love, and i dont have that kind of love in me

plane-crazy 2022-06-09 03:12:00 wasd is jerky, has no variable control, is a hell to balance, becomes very unstable when damaged, and often involves having random motors stick off ur wings

cheese graters can be fixed by placing thin blocks, but i dont care enough to do that on my own jets <:lmfao:527971550360633393>

<@896942820751978557> no we dont need lore its completely useless in a sandbox game

also it does matter bc im pretty sure it takes a large percentage of placing every block in the game to fill the plot as it is, making it more difficult to do so

Low effort according to the mods would be a build lazily thrown together by a mf as a shit post

This isnt that, complain all you want about it being relatively simple but its not “low effort”

creations-chat 2022-07-08 01:52:46 this is why i dont like mfs who make custom jets, most of the time they either look horendous or like a chinese knock off of a jet that already exists

and then the naming is worse

dragon fighter is the acception tho <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-07-08 01:55:09 <:what:644996672048463942> 

<@564463541248065547> most ppl who make custom jets just pull out a random letter and number pair out of their ass, and try hard to name it something cool

even professional companies suck at this, like the mfs behind ace combat thought "morgan" would be a cool name <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-07-08 01:57:13 what names u got, bc ive seen mfs use the same letter number combo as a jet that already exists irl and then call it the "flying gecko" or some thit

<@531650600295727115> 🤓
creations-chat 2022-07-08 02:01:00 letter combo is american <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>👍

plane-crazy 2022-07-21 11:22:34 typically if you wanna counter a shredder you need to have a higher top speed than it and decent maneuverability
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 11:22:50 Or just user a better shredder against them xd
plane-crazy 2022-07-21 11:23:26 xd

creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:51:37 i mean pc2 is meant to be a lot bigger, have like 20 players, have more blocks and tools for building, and be a lot less laggy

also wtf do u mean by skins? just paint ur build .-. 

also quests are a bit goofy for a sandbox game .-.

also having a dedicated pvp server is significantly better than a pvp arena bc that limits how and where u can pvp, and allows ppl to run away from a fight ._.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:57:04 all pc1 builds will port to pc2, meaning all the same building techniques will transfer over, u dont *have* to learn the new building stuffs being added to the game

summer ends in exactly one month in the netherlands, which is where rickje lives

<@728020153920520213> thats just lazy, also wouldnt work on motor locked builds ._.

<@410455661814480896> thats stupid, just learn to use the paint tool lmao
creations-chat 2022-08-22 01:59:53 if that happens a ton of players would be pissed off and not want to play pc2, so its in rickjes best interest to make sure all the regular shit like motor locking and glitched engines port over

Be able to out rate a clean f16 while carrying a full weapons load

Fire lasers bc why not

Be able to use its radar to track your balls from a hundred miles away while also mapping the terrain around it while being able to fire a missile behind itself while also acting as an AWACS while also acting as an electronic warfare suite all at once

Can also display holographic IR models of itself to trick enemies

creations-chat 2022-09-16 04:42:54 That cober sucked, you lifted in the air, lost center momentum because you lack vertical stabilizers, and instead of admitting that it was a shitty cobra, you instead call it a “side cobra”, also your recovery was dog water

I expected u to cobra while performing a knife edge

Either way heres a proper cobah

creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:01:33 I honestly need to make a new pvp jet guide to clean out pvp of those shitty planes, nams style of jet is ass in performance and looks, and leads to 75% od the ppl who follow his guide to just copy his flanker or eagle

creations-chat 2022-09-16 05:10:19 Nah, u gap them, turn around, and reengage

Only do that when u fired ur rockets bc like why stay in close quarters when u have no weapons

<@664538133114912783> no shit, i hide them inside the jet im not some ape who has my hover drives sticking outside my jet 🗿 

<@495210490172014612> literally wtf, i always say to put more wings up front and ballast in the back to cancel wobble

Also drag is the best way to get rid of wobble, i will not explain how that works tho bc top secret <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

Plus the amount of weight reduction namnam goes through is useless considering a majority of planes in this game weight nothing, and it only reduces durability making everything out of trails and trap doors

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 04:50:48 agreed
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 04:51:17 95% of my jets lack rudder control, i simply use gravity + roll if i need yaw
plane-crazy 2023-01-09 04:52:45 meanwhile the funny dorito plane every 9 year old fails to copy has unreasonable yaw **because the entire tail moves** <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

plane-crazy 2023-01-09 05:05:46 Too many wings in the front of an aircraft causes high speed instability, and discomectors weight too much for a plane with a 1x1x7 chassis

creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:24:18 MOTOR LOCK WINGS INTO MY WINGS TO **ENHANCE PERFORMANCE**

motor locking adds lag and more wings adds drag

you clearly have never built a plane for performance <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2023-02-05 04:27:52 it delivers my bombs fine, dont feel like rebuilding <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

<@937119057042358322> the bomber usually targets slow moving or still obkects, is not highly maneuverable and usually stays bellow 1k sps, i can afford the lag
the jet on the other hand is designed to be stable and maneuverable at speeds up to 4k sps so any additional lag can reduce its performance and cause more delay when fighting other players with jets of a similar performance
