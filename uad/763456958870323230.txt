creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:34:00 No, I mean how wide, for the deck

From the front to back

Or the overall length
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:36:50 I mean the sides

How long it is from left to right
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:39:04 I forgot the word
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:41:05 That big?

Sounds like Gerald R Ford (CVN-78) big
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:43:19 Can you calculate for the USS Midway? (CV-41)
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:45:23 Yeah, that sounds more logistic for the Midway

The CV-41 one (one to the far right)
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:47:38 So 95 blocks wide, but for what sides

And how long, from front of deck to the back
creations-chat 2022-04-01 14:49:38 Ok, got that, but 48 is the width?? Or is the width 95

I'm confused
