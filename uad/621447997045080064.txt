plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:02:13 <@!531690553285410833> this is as close as im getting i suck at building planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:03:43 combiine them into one
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:04:26 take like one feature from each lmao itll be fineeeee
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:04:48 tonk tred
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:37:57 TFW ur in pvp to have fun and people with turrets who blacklist everyone for immunity starts camping you
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:46:32 pvp isnt bad its just people who abuse turrets
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:46:38 turret is fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:46:49 i love playing with turrets dont get me wrong on that
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:07 but people who use turrets and mix it with blacklisting piss me off
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:43 oh cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:45 I HATE THEM
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:56 if u use a big creation and theers a cutter abuser in ur lobby
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:47:59 consider urself dead
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:48:19 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:48:27 but shredder bugs piss me offfff
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:49:10 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:49:44 ang it even gives u ram back!
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:30 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:44 tbh the only thing i find fine when abused are small creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:51:58 they may be nimble and fast but one nice rocket will DESTROY one
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:09 i have a like 5 block wide a-10 warthog
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:14 10 blocks i think idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:19 i got hit by a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:22 i got wrecked
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:52:39 i mean i got the details somewhat right
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:53:26 thats if they make a 2nd
pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:54:15 this is the a-10
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:54:52 i have to use a camera since its so damn small and its nauseous to fly however its fast and nimble
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:54:53 and a pro the having a cmaera instead of seat is u can do barrel rolls
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:19 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:56 idk i saw them in the image
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:55:58 so i put em on
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:56:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:56:35 it can do some pretty nice damage tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:56:52 if both rockets contact thats a good chunk
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:59:24 i knowww
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:59:43 my solution to it was putting AD turning on planes with small props
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 01:59:54 it allowed me to turn on a dime which helped with aim
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:10 using a and d to turn
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:12 with props
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:20 basically that but alot better
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:29 as yaw normally p bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:00:46 but with the props its literally on a dime depending on the size
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:01:06 banking is for the cool people
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:01:12 i do it on the warthog
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:01:31 but on 2 other planes i dont bank just yaw it like crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:02:42 that seems like a yikes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:02:57 my a-10 roll speed is a second at least
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:03:18 maybe like 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:04:25 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:04:40 recently ive stopped making large ish planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:04:50 now they are the small ones like u see in the a-10
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:06:21 idk what happened
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:06:43 i feel like making more technical things like engines than stuff that works like planes or boats
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:11:10 yeah same but instead of planes its mechanical stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:13:03 it issssss
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:13:17 literally ive quit most mechanical stuff bc of how confusing it gets sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:13:45 u added weight which reduced speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:14:17 it takes more force to power something if it has a heigher weight
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:14:57 still extra weight i dont know how much motors weigh thoigh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:15:00 though*
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:16:10 and lower friction
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:16:30 wait why didnt u try ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:16:36 u can control the weight of those
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:16:59 900 is still pretty fast
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:17:11 most of mine only go around 200-500
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:17:33 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:17:40 has to move alot of weight
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:17:55 ugh remember mag engines ad them going to like 1300
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:18:17 i dont know what a conveyor engine is
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:18:23 well the more tou know
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:18:36 i have never used motorlock too damn confusing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:18:48 i wont touch it with a 6 foot stick
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:19:19 time to make an overkill hover car engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:20:16 i also have this one idea of trying to translate scrap mechanic piston engine into here
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:20:27 however there are no sensors so it wont work at all
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:35:10 engines give me migranes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:35:23 help meeee
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:35:42 im talking about self powered
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:01 heres what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:05 u turn it on
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:08 u make it move
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:13 and it keeps going without touch
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:20 i dont know the word
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:22 autonomous
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:29 yes autonomous
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:36:31 i think
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:37:14 like this i guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:38:16 my brain it hurtsssss
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:38:26 look i even tried the SUPER simple ones
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:38:38 like a motor not powere with something rotating a rod
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:38:42 to transfer power
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:38:48 and i cant even get that to work
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:39:03 weird hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:40:26 i criiiiiii
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:40:38 engines make me wanna dieeeee
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:41:06 im getting to the edge of using a tut
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:41:09 this is pain
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 02:42:44 u got moving so fast any kill barriers didnt kill you and now roblox is freaking out and can barely load polygons

general 2021-11-13 14:54:35 bruh where did my video go for flight stability
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:05:10 ugh i was recording the video for a rank and i got into one of the most laggiest lobbies

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:27:01 ur motor lock go crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:27:45 smoke em in pvp dawg
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:27:56 thats the way of proving alpha male dominace in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:28:26 motorlock sitll goin crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:29:17 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:29:20 i remember i made a gun

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:34:49 its the greatest show EVER
]
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:36:18 straight up i never want to use motor lock because it makes my head go in loops and i cry at the end of it all
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:36:50 lemme in there
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:37:17 helikopter helikopter parakopter parakopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:37:45 ITS ABOUT DRIVE ITS ABOUT POWER WE STAY HUNGRY WE DEVOUR PUT IN THE WORK PUT IN THE HOURS AND TAKE WHATS OURS
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:37:58 that other dude cant spell smh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:39:53 i have this idea for weird wheel physics using suspension
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:40:15 i just wanna see what happens if u were to "increase
 or "decrease" the psi of wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:40:27 via the thingy
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:40:30 stiffness
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:40:51 perhaps more stiff wheels give advantages for drifting idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:49:34 didnt work
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:49:48 what do i build me boredom
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:50:34 bc as of now this is as good as it gets for looks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:52:08 literally any plane i make now is gonna look like that bc i suck at building
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:52:32 and also bc camera instead of seat on a plane gives u a new whole range of motion
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:55:57 this is all i see after moving the camera
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:56:08 2 circles and a line
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:56:15 it does do well in pvp ima give ti that
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:56:25 but like my builds look so awfulll ughh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:56:34 how in tf
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:57:09 alright dino
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:57:32 i am now going to mess with people on the internet using these planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:58:37 ur gonna need someone smarter than me to help u with that
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 15:59:33 also which is better in pvp legacy or new
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:01:29 what about all around
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:06:21 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:06:30 shredder abuser in my lobby so annoying
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:16:40 harrier vtol kinda pog?????
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:16:53 nvm what i posted does not look like a harrier
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:17:05 it looks like an abomination
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:19:41 is a harrier missile only i put guns on it for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 16:19:56 babier lmao

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 20:16:48 so sad the dude who taught me simple motorlock left to go in a priv server with some friends
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 21:04:00 and now i wait for my ticket

plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:34:26 my f1 car is sooo slow
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:34:38 however idk how i can make a good "engine" for it
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:34:47 it tops out at like 200 speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:34:59 without aero it goes to 400 but it wont steer
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:36:24 help me pls
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:38:45 f1 car
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:38:52 i sent images of it earlier
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:39:03 scroll up
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:39:08 at around 7 ish
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:39:25 it has downward thrust but it still fishtails with aero too
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:40:13 it turns
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:40:18 but when i try to turn it just whips
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:45:07 
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:46:30 it likes to turn while going straight and all turns i make make it oversteer
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:50:30 it worked
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:50:42 only thing now is that it needs more speed and better turning
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:50:44 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:53:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:54:01 with downforce in the rear it goes about 216
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:54:07 without it goes up to 416
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 13:55:23 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-12-25 14:21:30 just SO SLOW
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 14:22:06 like the acceleration is ok-ish
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 14:22:12 but it is sooo slow
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 14:22:24 a max top speed of 230 is not niceeee
plane-crazy 2021-12-25 14:30:27 i made it faster

creations-chat 2021-12-26 20:10:24 i would if i knew motorlock at all but i wont get anywhere if i dont try it atleast once
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:23:14 Oh no I didn’t mean it as a new discovery
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:25:40 I meant it as very light usage of motor lock to put things into place as in a locked motor on the side skirts to pull em in or on the wheels to bring those in. nothing special
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:29:50 motorlock with extra steps so yes
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:32:26 honestly i dont classify my usage of it as motorlock so i just said "motorlock"
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:36:50 that is some really good motorlock i cant even see the motor
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:43:53 if i made it any shorter i would have a aneurism making the thing look right
creations-chat 2021-12-26 21:46:05 aha yeah no i dont know how to do normal motorlock anyway
