creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:43:46 <@456226577798135808> isnt the Blue Comet y'know... ***blue???*** i mean it cant be called blue if its red, they are two opposite colors. literally, blue is red inverted.

creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:48:36 go hang out in tornado alley, that'll really do the trick.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:51:42 when weathering, i'd say take the original color and subtract between 50-100 then paint. not the best of methods, but it still works.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:53:55 considering that i weather them not at all, they look fine to me. i only have 2 weathered builds, and they are weathered a little more than a tank
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:56:25 i also chose 50-100 bc i forgot the numbers i actually use
creations-chat 2021-11-06 02:58:45 looks kinda like moss
creations-chat 2021-11-13 05:55:57 pardon my lack of trophy truck knowledge but i think either the top of the truck is too tall or the bed is too short (in height). maybe add an extra cylinder or two on the wheels to make them more accurate
creations-chat 2021-11-13 05:59:25 maybe use this for reference
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:01:50 shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to match. extending is easy, but its the extra wheels is where the issues might occur.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:04:04 1-2 blocks should do it
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:12:17 much more accurate
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:18:01 buildings mostly. i suck at planes and trains. *that or i‚Äôll work on another build i have that needs work*
creations-chat 2021-11-13 06:24:32 its actually more complex than it looks. it has a full meltdown sequence, with a lockdown implemented. parts fall (including the sign) others explode, and one of the floors collapses. the logo is on top and folds into position, along with an incredibly long pole with a light at the end and the parking lot. i‚Äôm not in pc rn and this is a 13k block creation so its not loaded in. *the logos on the top are other companies that Bus Co. is allied with* ~~it was also designed to be a giant bus~~
creations-chat 2021-11-14 03:48:31 <@!639374429532717056> you are taking ‚Äòpotato mode‚Äô very literal

creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:07:03 perhaps i could make an artificial moon, since the only working lights are the ones on the bus. which is over 50 years old. (there are literally no lights whatsoever in Bus Stop Simulator. the nearest one is the disco ball in Blox Donald's.)
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:10:23 i literally tried to get the lighting bug so i could get something out of the dark pics. nope. nothing changed.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:32:24 lower the brightness maybe? (there aren't supposed to *be* any lamp posts. that's why it was so dark to begin with.)
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:37:13 yeah adjusting the brightness did nothing. i'll just have to lower it carefully then.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:48:50 i suggest using waterwheels for fans, although they are made of wood they look pretty good. not if you set them to toggle <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2021-11-26 06:51:13 there *isss* a bug that they still slow down with toggle, but its at random.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:03:09 dont intend on changing and/or posting this, just thought i'd throw it out there for a little help. also, the PCC is harsh on bad builds. diamond plate platforms are blast covers for the windows, and the blast doors are obvious. also has a full meltdown sequence.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:05:11 Fun Fact: screenshot number for 2nd image is #69 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:09:28 full info: the core section of the facility is located underground (despite the giant window saying otherwise, that's just the core chamber.) it has a full meltdown sequence, falling parts, etc. blast doors and covers are functional, has a working elevator, safegaurd, and eye-removing explosion. top floor in the image is the generator room, middle is the control, and lowest is coolant. ~~also, i forgot to paint the center of the ceiling fans. ~~ <--- that's bad. really bad.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:16:45 *~~let this be a good lesson to not say things~~*
creations-chat 2021-11-26 07:18:57 i was tossed in front of a train when i first started posting

gotta have thick skin to thrive in this community.
creations-chat 2021-11-26 23:48:04 anyone got any tips for making a build look abandoned? thus far i have (excessive) rust, rust streaks, overgrown foliage, broken sidewalks, broken glass, flat tires, and a bad horn. at this point i have no clue what else i need

creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:38:13 btw, i need a hand with the chandeliers ~~which look like ice crystals right now,~~ the engines (which look fine now, but they aren't mine and i don't like stealing other people's work), and the projector, which is literally 3 different sizes of cylinders. it sucks.
creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:41:29 the stern on my ship uses a bunch of wedge blocks, triangle wedges, and regular wedges. it's more complex than it looks and it hurt my brain to do. same follows for under the bow, which can't quite be seen.

creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:50:40 anyways, i need a hand with my ship. just the chandeliers~~which look like ice crystals right now,~~ the engines (which look fine now, but they aren't mine and i don't like stealing other people's work), and the projector, which is literally 3 different sizes of cylinders. they suck.
creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:53:01 oh no the ship is fine.

creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:51:50 <@!401530469952389130> passenger side wing mirror is in the wrong position. it should be more towards the front
creations-chat 2021-12-12 00:57:00 also the no-ghost cross is facing the wrong way. from top to bottom it starts at the right
creations-chat 2021-12-12 01:24:01 see how it's further from the door than it is on the driver's side?
that's how it was designed

creations-chat 2021-12-21 01:46:03 y‚Äôall talking about how <@456226577798135808> is related to the Invisible Boatmobile

but why didnt you peice together that he‚Äôs related to the Ecto-1?
creations-chat 2021-12-21 02:00:25 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulances are more so related to the Eldorado
creations-chat 2021-12-21 02:04:36 i say it‚Äôs more related since some of the parts are interchangeable
creations-chat 2021-12-21 19:31:06 not even hyperbot downvoted it
creations-chat 2021-12-24 05:47:11 ~~***you didnt see that earlier message***~~
how accurate do you guys think my Ecto-1 is?

*(side notes: the siren is in fact the original siren, and the engine and horn are from Cadillacs. Cleanin' Up the Town is on the radio, along with the montage from the original movie.)* https://streamable.com/7zpmwl
*(2nd side note, there have been some slight modifications since the last <#384025409945337856> upload but they were too small to mention. ~~also i forgot what they were.)~~*
~~haha exposed motorlocc go brrrrr~~
creations-chat 2021-12-24 05:50:26 Ecto-1A and the Afterlife rendition of Ecto-1 are also in my slots.
i hate having to update all of them.
creations-chat 2021-12-24 05:54:18 in the end, all builds are just blocks and wedges that look like something.
most of them look like garbage on wheels.

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:13:51 but mostly tutorials.
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:14:34 ***~~shredder bugs~~***

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:16:33 configure the server

plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:22:56 i'd say it's a building but there are barely any tutorials for those
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:23:39 i also have a building that has over 2000 beam 1x7's

plane crazy broke and it doesnt care
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:23:47 it keeps them whenever i load it
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:24:18 no i can.
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:24:20 just didnt want to.
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:24:30 but i did
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:24:53 problem is that i always run on potato mode

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 22:39:01 yes the tank is garbage
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 22:40:13 im also kinda curious
plane-crazy 2022-01-06 22:40:29 if you saw a bus tank pull up to your stop

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:05:06 someone mentioned that this bus was good yesterday
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:05:14 i think they need to get a check for insanity
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:06:36 btw the whole thing is metal
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:06:48 you could add the texture to your blocks and it shouldnt do too much
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:07:00 didn't need that torso anyways
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 17:07:16 it'll grow back right?

creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:10:16 i assume that people that cant comprehend how to build that good or aren't experienced in that field in some sort of way have low standards.

for me, i got decent standards for like ships and cars and some other stuff
creations-chat 2022-09-25 03:13:18 well i mean im kinda like that. could get an expert rank for a few things, just dont really care that much to do it

go for tier 4 ranks, you only really need the high block count

plane-crazy 2022-11-08 20:18:20 i think some time around last December was the first announced release date
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 20:19:59 by the looks of it things seem to be pretty good

plane-crazy 2022-11-08 20:21:59 because roblox has decided your name shall be purple.

general 2023-02-21 06:13:40 that's kinda just wrong
general 2023-02-21 06:14:42 they're lightweight
general 2023-02-21 06:14:46 good for maneuvering
general 2023-02-21 06:15:29 i use tanks <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:16:49 for some reason
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:16:55 i can't decode why my guns wont work
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:17:00 they only face downward
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:17:20 then again i dont really care because the whole build is impractical and sucks ass
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:17:46 used motor 2's
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:18:41 no <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:18:53 you don't say
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:19:29 i used to have the main guns on the tank set to follow the mouse
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:19:33 and the tank is amphibious
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:19:40 so whenever they touched the water
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:19:45 the whole thing evaporated
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:20:01 worse when you throw in treads
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:20:38 the result is worse
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:20:46 because there are functioning treads in the tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:21:18 they do
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:21:25 it's just that-
plane-crazy 2023-02-21 06:21:27 ah nvm.

i think we might need to make the rules a lot more obvious because the whitenames seem to not know how to follow them
oh yeah also <@573970670854340628>
creations-chat 2023-03-28 22:52:34 hate to break it to you, but we're all pretty fucking sick of seeing shitty builds and more shitty builds that break the rules.

you may think you're funny, but you're not.
you may think that just because it isnt directly stated in the rules it's allowed, but it's not.

have some fucking common sense, all of you.

what you're saying is the equivalent of "i'm black so i can say the word starting with the letter n"

it doesn't matter where you're from or what ethnicity you are, race means nothing in this server, it's irrelevant, and it's against the rules.

and, fun fact: Germans don't even like that symbol.

general 2023-04-15 02:42:36 then they got combined
general 2023-04-15 02:42:45 and i think a third came in to copy the configs

general 2023-07-12 01:39:32 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called erro

i'm on the little to no good builds anymore team <:verycool:755817509567070351>
creations-chat 2023-07-17 21:02:09 effort and build quality are not the same thing

around the time when i first joined (mid 2021) there was pretty much a consistent flow of good builds.

as 2022 rolled in more whitenames and newer members started joining and so the quality of builds went down

that doesn't mean that there **aren't** good builds, just not that many as there used to be.

(also note that the people saying that there arent any good builds in creations are also older pcc members who were around when there were better builds)
