general 2018-11-27 17:42:53 I try to keep an eye out for shady stuff from staff, I always try to call out stuff that seems like they are using their position to make people do what they want or to attack them in one way or another. Its my duty XD
general 2018-11-27 17:43:01 WRONG

general 2018-11-27 17:44:38 I feel like if I say something the mods disagree with I can expect a backlash from it.
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 17:45:25 I am assuming Plane Crazy was inspired by BYOM?
general 2018-11-27 17:48:37 I feel like I just told somebody I had a scary monster under my bed and the monster apologized. Fricken weird dude! XD
general 2018-11-27 17:49:11 I bed you would feel relaxed if you left discord for like half an hour
general 2018-11-27 17:49:19 bet*
general 2018-11-27 17:50:41 To me its because of how aggro you were coming across. I didnt even know anybody was upset I just thought it would be funny to say "haha you guys suck" and it felt like you were itching mute me.
