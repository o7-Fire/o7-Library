help 2021-04-15 19:42:26 u can do a full lock i guess? starting at the end of the canopy with pistons?
help 2021-04-15 19:43:08 so it opens up and down. with motor it kinda complicates things
help 2021-04-15 19:44:05 i can build and show a vid i guess? but im not promising anything
help 2021-04-15 19:48:29 
help 2021-04-15 19:48:34 here's an example
help 2021-04-15 19:48:47 i cant tell apart what blocks u used exactly
help 2021-04-15 19:49:09 but the front and rear canopy seems pretty clear to me
help 2021-04-15 19:49:47 if u run into problems with covering the top motor u can use block 1x09
help 2021-04-15 19:51:00 i am so confused

general 2021-05-18 15:40:16 i think a friend of mine found an engine faster and smaller than the hover engine
general 2021-05-18 15:40:30 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:15:07 Question, is it just me or is roblox broken
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:16:13 I've posted multiple creation alr in the past
help 2021-05-25 17:23:24 same
help 2021-05-25 17:27:08 9K reports lol
creations-chat 2021-06-07 16:12:13 Oof, you certainly live up to the name 'TheIceHero' . Yeah i can agree
creations-chat 2021-06-07 16:14:24 looks too long and alot of stuff sticking out on the sides
creations-chat 2021-06-13 07:48:04 Looking good but the side feels abit flat
creations-chat 2021-06-13 07:56:55 cool beans, but the side feels too flat and blocky
creations-chat 2021-06-13 07:59:21 add triangle wedge on the side then add some wedge 1x1 behind it
creations-chat 2021-06-13 08:10:00 nice, but why does the horizontal stabilizer have a motor on the side?
creations-chat 2021-06-13 08:16:06 they don't probably lol
creations-chat 2021-06-13 08:32:19 I meant on ur tail.  there's a locked motor it seems
creations-chat 2021-06-13 08:34:35 why is it there in the first place though? could just remove it
creations-chat 2021-06-13 12:00:30 üò¢
creations-chat 2021-06-13 12:11:51 abit too transparent for me, looks good though
creations-chat 2021-06-13 12:19:00 that looks really clean
creations-chat 2021-06-13 12:23:31 <:ElonApprove:589130525315301380>
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:16:20 im remaking my f22 any thoughts on what I could make better?
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:02:13 Any feedback on how to improve this F22?
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:04:39 I'm following the pic online of the F22 and the wings seems to be pretty close to it. It looks close to me atleast i haven't finished the conopy or anything yet
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:08:27 The wings looks pretty far back in this pic though. might just be me being stupid and halucinating idk
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:10:44 isnt the rules in creation and not in creation feedback?. oops wrong person, srry
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:12:51 I see my nose is abit long, but what about my wings? the 3d model looks pretty far back aswell. what do u think about the wings?
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:16:42 Alright, Ty for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-16 20:14:01 Just finished the F22 any thoughts? it's prob the camera angle mb, i suck at taking photos
creations-chat 2021-06-16 20:18:42 i kinda like the nose since it's like the one Irl with a sharp edge
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:10:38 imagine if it malfunctions mid-flight and the wings starts closing üíÄ
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:17:03 reading past convo, he says he downvotes anything that could be ''improved'' and gives feedback if they wants some. Idk man ask him for feedback on why he downvoted ur build
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:19:43 the part under the glass could be smoothed out and the shape of the wings are weird
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:26:46 Why are the quality of the photos so low
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:32:39 Looks good but image is abit too blurry to see tiny details
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:42:46 upload a better quality pic
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:45:18 wheels are just a blank circle, could be detailed abit more, looks too big compared to the actual build. There's just a chunk of block at the front
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:47:54 chill out with the passive aggressiveness, u wanted feedback. Dont gatta get mad
creations-chat 2021-06-18 18:50:09 You literally asked why i down voted ur build?
help 2021-06-18 19:10:53 depends on the size. But mostly using ballast block with helium and some wing pannels to slow down the fall usually helps with building an ok mech
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:14:47 You did misuse <#384025409945337856> which is against the rules
creations-chat 2021-06-18 19:17:06 Nice
help 2021-06-20 16:25:00 That really depends on a few thing. First ur heli is flying in multiple direction causing it to thrash around, make it stable first and able to pitch forward or backward on command
help 2021-06-20 16:26:58 ur using motor 1?
help 2021-06-20 16:27:31 not recommend using motor 1
help 2021-06-20 16:30:56 
help 2021-06-20 16:31:15 use engine powered rotors like this
help 2021-06-20 16:31:24 or u can use rockets
help 2021-06-20 16:32:12 if ur doing single rotor there's a lot of turning that needs to be done
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:11:27 WOW!!!!!! FLY SO SMOOTH PLZ PUT IN HOF
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:13:31 Can u make the middle of the barrel a bit rounder? u can try using sparklers. (not the whole barrel, just the part where it's kinda square after the cylinder.)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:15:34 overall, looks really nice and clean. Good job!
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:18:20 prob people just looking to troll or they see smth they don't like. personally it looks nice
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:20:35 lucky, I dont even have the skill
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:22:53 Any feedback on my heli? (apart from paint cuz I cant be bothered due to how bad i am at it)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:24:56 it's still not removed?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:26:58 exposed on the rotor? if so then I cant really cover it since the motor locks are used for locking the hover engine and the other half lock is for centering the blades
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:31:05 ask for Plane crazy help in <#478584971670454284> but while we're here. If ur build is big, you might need more, around 4 to 6 control surfaces on the nose. other than that if it still wobbles then it's the balancing issue not the amount of control surfaces
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:34:02 looks cool but without the tiny detail i feel like it would look bland and blocky
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:36:03 yeah......... Goodluck with it! lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:57:52 This a bit better? i dont wanna put the hover engine at the end of the blade since it kinda sticks to to me so i tried putting some disconnecter to hide it
general 2021-06-21 15:13:44 POG
general 2021-06-21 15:22:36 prob cuz u alr have it
help 2021-07-02 12:21:00 Image perms are image permission to post in certain channels like <#384025409945337856> and once u get image perms you should be able to post vids aswell. Usually via Streamable
help 2021-07-02 12:22:44 you need to upload ur video to steamable then post the link aswell
help 2021-07-02 12:24:46 either in <#384025409945337856> or <#504436696021204992>
help 2021-07-02 12:26:16 some channels don't allow videos
help 2021-07-02 12:26:54 and if ur video isn't about a creation in Plane Crazy it would also remove it
help 2021-07-02 12:28:45 i dont think tutorials are allowed in creation or creation feedback.
help 2021-07-02 12:29:41 it needs to be posted in <#537387160261885962> and you need to get contributor rank first by getting a certain amount of subs on youtube from your videos
creations-chat 2021-07-02 12:31:07 i think it's prob cuz of the ailerons
help 2021-07-02 12:33:16 ‚Ä¢ Have at least 200 subscribers and/or 20,000 total views on your channel.
‚Ä¢ Have received at least 300 views per video.
‚Ä¢ Have at least 10 total videos about Plane Crazy.
‚Ä¢ Have at least 3 videos uploaded within the past month (30 days).
‚Ä¢ Have an expert rank or higher.
creations-chat 2021-07-02 12:33:48 it kinda looks wonky, you could try to move the motor closer to the ailerons itself
help 2021-07-02 14:28:51 could be due to multiple things
help 2021-07-02 14:29:11 it could be due to your motor glitching out or your engine
help 2021-07-02 14:29:51 most likely due to the torque on the motor
help 2021-07-02 14:30:02 usually motors are perfect in this game
help 2021-07-02 14:31:18 so from time to time it glitches abit and one motor slows down and your build starts drifting. there's no way of fixing it, only way is to have an engine to yaw it to another side
help 2021-07-02 14:31:37 what's the motor for?
help 2021-07-02 14:31:57 what's ur build?
help 2021-07-02 14:33:03 are the ones ur using locked or nah?

creations-chat 2021-07-04 11:59:31 good reference pic, but looking at the shape and size of the wings, horizontal stabilizer are the wrong shape. you missed a few delta wings and ur main wing doesn't look oval at the front. in the reference pic the back wings are half of the main wings when looking and comparing them

help 2021-07-07 15:08:53 if you're being logical about this, this game is trying to lean towards realism with physics and shit. You built a ''ship'' which flies which cant really be classified as a ship if it cant be used on water. If it flies it's more or so is a Blimp

creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:40:04 Ur plane is a decent idea and you know motor locking but makes no effort to hide things like motors or rocket engine. <@!251880826386513924> maximum efficiency
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:42:16 If ur making a plane that big, proportion wise make the engine (rocket engine in this case) bigger
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:45:14 The body is the wrong shape. Looking at the pic the bottom is round and gets thinner as it approach the tail. Nice, but it's still not as oval and round as the pic,try adding another layer of half block in the middle to front part of the body
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:51:03 I understand the pain lol
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:54:17 Length seems fine, it's just the shape of the body and the size of the engine
creations-chat 2021-07-14 17:57:55 Just add another layer of half block it just feels too skinny at the bottom

help 2021-07-16 16:11:36 You can try using motors but it's not as circular or cylinders but they're hella thicc
help 2021-07-16 16:12:43 half wedges are asymmetrical so i'd prob wouldn't recommend using em for missiles
help 2021-07-16 16:13:05 Well not asymmetrical but you kinda get what i mean
help 2021-07-16 16:13:46 My advice, either just go with sparklers or use cylinder for thiccer missiles
help 2021-07-16 16:14:16 i can try showing u one missile design using sparklers if u want
help 2021-07-16 16:14:27 F
help 2021-07-16 16:14:56 i'd go with cylinder but they're going to be quite massive
help 2021-07-16 16:15:55 smart
help 2021-07-16 16:16:19 but aren't using motors the same as disconnectors
help 2021-07-16 16:16:37 automatically looping with servo motors has it's limits

help 2021-07-16 16:17:40 just normal motors with toggle
help 2021-07-16 16:18:12 only way i can think of is either motor locking or some other witch craft
help 2021-07-16 16:18:54 yeah that was where my thought process was going lol

help 2021-07-16 16:35:57 Anyone has any idea how to use that one control surface that looks like a delta wing?

help 2021-07-16 16:41:55 where would it go tho?
help 2021-07-16 16:44:09 Considering the shape of that control surface looks wonky i'd rather make a custom wedge than use that burning garbo
help 2021-07-16 16:44:24 but i get what u mean

creations-chat 2021-07-16 17:59:20 When we talk about new features we dont mean changing the whole layout of the plane we meant things like, the heads display inside the cockpit or hidden ejection seats. looking at ur wings on the Mig it isn't even correct in the first place
creations-chat 2021-07-16 18:02:18 out of missiles? use them as a melee attack of the plane, just fly close enough then smack the opponent's wings ripping their wings and ur landing gears. 10/10 design
creations-chat 2021-07-16 18:09:23 looking abit like Vulpen's tutorial
creations-chat 2021-07-16 18:12:51 not saying it's the tutorial, just the fact that there's alot of details exactly like Vulpen's ones. Not camo, The wings are exactly the same, the exhaust are also exactly the same but looks abit shorter

help 2021-07-16 18:43:40 im pretty sure the the 2 rotors are canceling each other's torque so im pretty sure the back rotor isn't doing anything
help 2021-07-16 18:45:04 ^^^
help 2021-07-16 18:45:35 unless the speed of ur motors are vastly different that's the only way it will be leaning
help 2021-07-16 18:46:34 putting them both at half of each other's speed will counter the torque and stops the spinning / leaning / turning
help 2021-07-16 18:47:31 put the top at 20

help 2021-07-26 09:53:37 2 Blade rotors
help 2021-07-26 09:55:51 While in motion the blades generate lift at it's point of rotation while the other parts aren't generating enough lift causting part of the helicopter to fall and lift depending on where the blade is
help 2021-07-26 09:56:25 ^ that sentence i just wrote terribly describes the problem
help 2021-07-26 09:56:55 you can still pitch
help 2021-07-26 09:56:58 and everything
help 2021-07-26 09:58:09 the problem just lies with either having another rotor on top also a 2 blade spinning in the opposite direction to counter the torque and also fix the shaking problem
help 2021-07-26 09:58:14 or u can make it 4 blade
help 2021-07-26 09:58:19 which fixes the shaking
help 2021-07-26 09:58:36 it's just harder to control with 2 blades
help 2021-07-26 09:58:44 it does work
help 2021-07-26 09:58:58 still works
help 2021-07-26 09:59:18 it's just hard to actually get it to fly and controllable due to how unstable it is

help 2021-07-26 10:01:49 usually irl it's either using a gyroscope to fix it

help 2021-08-27 04:17:24 Quick helicopter knowledge
_In this game tail rotor doesn't work as countering the torque
_A non coaxial is not recommended to be used to pitch the heli
_Use an internal engine to make it fly, pitch, roll
help 2021-08-27 04:18:01 It's flipping over or rolling when pitching because of the rotor creating lift
help 2021-08-27 06:20:46 it's impossible to fly straight using the blades for pitching or lifting when the heli is non coaxial, Why u might ask? the more you pitch the blades to generate more lift the more the rolling will occur and roll even stronger to the point where it's uncontrollable even with rocket engines to counter it
help 2021-08-27 06:21:42 not skill issues it's just the games mechanics
help 2021-08-27 06:21:51 pitching the tail rotor won't be enough still

help 2022-01-14 15:04:19 Dont understand the problem
help 2022-01-14 15:04:44 wait was it the glitching out then dying at light speed?
help 2022-01-15 05:21:26 Most likely due to the unfolding of the blades
help 2022-01-15 05:23:27 even when locked depending on how heavy the object it's attached to it can still glitch it plus if there were multiple motor attached to it aswell will cause it to be more likely to glitch
help 2022-01-15 05:23:54 that's too much
help 2022-01-15 05:24:01 spacing them out correctly helps
help 2022-01-15 05:24:05 but not by alot
help 2022-01-15 05:25:20 well can't really forcefully stop it from glitching unless you use a different mechanism
help 2022-01-15 05:25:25 or less motor
help 2022-01-15 05:26:55 well im guessing the stress mainly comes from the spinning blades, since moving motor around at a high speed causes problems aswell
help 2022-01-15 05:28:19 i gatta get on and see for myself what the exact problem is

creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:54:19 Probably just the wings, i just made em in a few sec so i might try to angle lock it instead of using normal delta wings
Thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:56:45 prob looks that way cuz i haven't made the inner part yet, should look more square once i eventually figure it out
Massive pain since the inner part requires a 2.5 tall wings or disconnector

creations-chat 2022-02-15 02:39:41 Any thoughts on what aircraft i should turn this into?
Was originally going to be a J20 but i feel like it's nothing close to one
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:05:09 Thoughts on intakes?
Ignore the nose, the piston locking kinda died lol
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:08:01 it's smoother usually, i was focusing on the intakes. the piston locking died on me mid lock so the nose looks weird
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:10:14 Here's the usual nose, not perfectly lock(but close enoughü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ), and now the intakes messed up lol
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:12:59 Which part?
Some parts does look wack but i'll probably smooth it all out later on
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:19:49 Top view
<@!678986403153182772> yeah parts of the builds aren't too my liking but this is as compact as my brain can make the intakes
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:28:31 Canopy was mainly due to piston lock straight up messin up, whenever i angle the part the pistons starts to shift
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:32:43 Wym, literally most of the locking either require luck to get perfectly due to the piston being glitchy and shifting 90 percent of the time, plus why need to go through the length of makin everything perfect when it's not the finish product lol
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:34:48 Should i change nose shape and intake shape?, i had an idea for this intake but i can switch
The bump inside the intake was kinda taken from the J20 bump inside the intakes but im thinking of removing em and making the intake smaller in general
creations-chat 2022-02-15 17:36:53 alright ima mess around with the intake shape and change the canopy around then üëç 
Thanks

help 2022-05-22 13:48:27 hmm
help 2022-05-22 13:48:31 is it on servo?
help 2022-05-22 13:49:23 tbh without being able to see it first hand i've no clue what's causing the treads to die
help 2022-05-22 13:49:32 could be due to when u lock motor 2 tend to be laggy
help 2022-05-22 13:49:52 preferably use anchor then lock it, that could help
help 2022-05-22 13:50:02 physics on?
help 2022-05-22 13:50:41 yeah i have zero clue
help 2022-05-22 13:55:49 Lol
help 2022-05-22 13:56:05 best way is prob anchor
help 2022-05-22 13:56:13 since it keeps everything in place
help 2022-05-22 13:56:21 though with a motor locked build it could go both ways
help 2022-05-22 13:57:49 if nothing works it'll prob be best to rebuild the whole thing and place the tracks at a different place
help 2022-05-22 13:58:19 the pain i had with my last creation
help 2022-05-22 13:59:13 anything with lots of motor or piston + anchor will send u to space
help 2022-05-22 14:00:00 this took me more than 10 tries to lock it and multiple rejoin cuz i keep crashing every time i locked it
help 2022-05-22 14:00:25 no lag, i just get sent into space and the game crashes
help 2022-05-22 14:00:48 and then there's that 1 chance where everything comes together finally
help 2022-05-22 14:01:24 i'd say try to lock it over and over again and see if it's due to consistency or nah
help 2022-05-22 14:01:39 with anchor
help 2022-05-22 14:02:20 at this point im just waiting for PC2 which is in 2022 summer time
help 2022-05-22 14:02:49 it's what they said in announcement
help 2022-05-22 14:02:57 which is in a few months
help 2022-05-22 14:19:42 what do u mean?
help 2022-05-22 14:20:51 uhhhhhhhh
help 2022-05-22 14:21:02 not really since gravity slider is kinda weird
help 2022-05-22 14:21:37 with helium it causes a build to go up towards the sky
help 2022-05-22 14:21:44 with ballast tank they make things heavy
help 2022-05-22 14:22:38 best thing to sub gravity slider would either be lots of hover engine made in a way to cause lots of drag or wings to do the same thing
help 2022-05-22 15:38:35 Usually u dont in PC
help 2022-05-22 15:38:55 the torque produced by 1 bladed heli in PC is weird
help 2022-05-22 15:39:08 so instead of relying on the blade itself for thrust
help 2022-05-22 15:39:18 they have engines inside the heli
help 2022-05-22 15:40:11 then why asked how to counter spin if there's no spin lol
help 2022-05-22 15:40:54 yeah, it shouldn't produce torque if the main thrust isn't actually coming from the rotor
help 2022-05-22 15:43:17 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/867052656962043946 
Here's mine
help 2022-05-22 15:43:43 spinning rotor with zero torque unless there's forward motion
help 2022-05-22 15:44:35 ...
help 2022-05-22 15:44:43 ohhhhhhhhh
help 2022-05-22 15:44:53 GL with that
help 2022-05-22 15:45:23 either go for a swashplate or spend countless hours working on a janky counter torque system
help 2022-05-22 15:45:29 is servo on?
help 2022-05-22 15:46:01 is anything connected to it?
help 2022-05-22 15:46:10 take a pic pls
help 2022-05-22 15:47:15 but his uses thrusters like mine....
help 2022-05-22 15:47:22 cant help u there
help 2022-05-22 15:48:03 i have em on the rotors aswell
help 2022-05-22 15:48:14 there's disconnectors hiding em
help 2022-05-22 15:48:39 he uses the same way of flight like mine
help 2022-05-22 15:50:57 There‚Äôs no torque since there‚Äôs zero thrust from the main rotor itself‚Ä¶.
help 2022-05-22 15:51:50 There‚Äôs ‚Äúthrusters‚Äù on my rotor just like eliasg but there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthrust‚Äù being produced by them
help 2022-05-22 15:52:48 There‚Äôs 0 pitch in the blades
help 2022-05-22 15:52:51 Meaning 0 thrust
help 2022-05-22 15:53:05 But there‚Äôs thrusters allowing for the blade to spin
help 2022-05-22 15:55:38 U can see Elias rolling when his blades are tilted
help 2022-05-22 15:55:47 He has engines inside his heli to counter that
help 2022-05-22 15:57:08 ‚Ä¶.
help 2022-05-22 15:57:50 There‚Äôs engines used to control, yaw and roll I‚Äôm guessing from his video
help 2022-05-22 15:57:56 In either directions
help 2022-05-22 15:59:19 Usually these engines are propellers
help 2022-05-22 16:10:31 Also if ur trying to go for helicopter technician rank then ur not allowed to use any sort of thrusters if I‚Äôm correct
help 2022-05-31 13:50:55 Heli in PC is wack, the torque created from the blade pitching creates a roll type torque instead of a yaw type
help 2022-05-31 13:53:20 depending on which direction your blade is spinning and whether you lift or push down, it could roll both right and left

creations-chat 2022-06-05 13:04:35 Half block side intake or 1 block? any thoughts?
Suppose to be a heli, so should i do 1 full block then?
<@410455661814480896> yeah what i was thinking, didnt really wanna go full on AH-1s or Supercobra, wanted to modify it around abit

Not the final thing, just temporary for now to see how it all works
creations-chat 2022-06-05 13:59:33 as said it's temporary since im just checking motor placement and whether or not it'll work but yeah definitely will shorten the blades

creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:13:06 Yeah it's kinda thick it's like 2 blocks thick, 1 whole block in the middle and half blocks on each side
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:15:31 Really nice and clean nose imo apart from certain part
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:24:00 Here's a good custom one <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:26:05 Should i make the blade on my heli 2 blocks thick or 1 block thick?
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:28:20 that's going to show alot of exposed motor <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

creations-chat 2022-06-06 06:15:42 any shorter and the tail rotor would prob hit the main rotor

creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:38:19 using a tail rotor in PC to counter a torque?

on what build tho, a heli?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:41:07 yeah but using a tail rotor for actual torque countering dont work...  unless you build in a swashplate but even so you'll need a pretty intricate tail rotor 
In this game
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:43:56 definitely need a working tail rotor and yeah they work quite well but for normal builds they never really works been building helis for a while and have spent a good few chunk of my time finding good placement for tail rotor, with how this game torque works i dont think it'll work

im stupid as hell <@706717603258957864> üóø
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:48:36 Here's a pic with a heli build that is what people might use for normal builds, main rotor powered by hover engines, the way the torque is generated it weird since it'll only take affects when there's a change in any direction,

wait was the main rotor powered by something or just normal powered motor?<@531650600295727115>
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:50:55 did u have a slightly angled tail rotor?

wait how'd you counter the roll since torque from powered motor with pitched blades on main rotor causes the heli to roll to one side or another
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:54:42 the tail rotor usually shouldn't generate torque, more or so the torque is too small to notice.
having propellor blades im pretty sure made the torque even worse as well as the rolling

either way interesting idea to put stacks on wings to counteract the roll but how'd you take off if there's that much friction

the normal heli blade block has a good amount of pitch to it so the torque is pretty high in itself at low speed<@706717603258957864>
i'm 100percent sure you can counteract the torque that is generated to make it spin but the rolling is the problem in this game with counteracting torque
creations-chat 2022-07-05 14:58:23 less torque and less power and they build up torque and power the faster you spin the blades
not much difference between them tbh

even with people i've seen with massive gigachad brain to build swashplate rotors is that they struggle with torque aswell trying to use a tail rotor like a conventional heli

even with normal heli with the pic i sent you still get rolls but it's mainly when you start to move forward, though the torque is much less and builds up the faster you go
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:02:34 I can't imagine flying with a normal heli with powered motor and the amount of roll it'll create when moving forward since even getting lift you start to roll hella hard lol
GL
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:21:08 here's a usually normal heli with counter torque and taking off, near the end when it starts going forward and leaning right that's what the torque is like
https://streamable.com/pdsret
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:55:12 a powered non coaxial rotor in this game causes both yaw and roll
the vid is an example of the rolling in both system, the vid rotor system still generates roll but only during forward motion, with a powered non coaxial system in this game it causes roll and yaw even without much change in direction, yawing in this system occurs indefinitely and the rolling occurs when there's lift when the blade is pitched
creations-chat 2022-07-05 15:58:59 maybe try making the front first?
yeah the rotor system on mine creates a rolling type torque during forward motion<@639374429532717056>, the first part of the video shows a counter roll system and near the end i kinda rolled right and almost dive bombed into the water

Maybe ur doing the motor lock wrong?<@866895140014522369>
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:06:06 There‚Äôs propellor engines in the heli to help with rolling (this does not help with counteracting the torque)
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:08:16 I used motor locking to forcibly glitch ALOT of propellor engine into my heli to hide it so it can pitch, yaw and roll
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:13:06 It does though‚Ä¶ as said it only generates it during forward motion with a rolling type torque, true zero yawing type torque does not occur at all, as well as there being no torque during hovering either
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:19:58 There‚Äôs no such term as ‚Äúrolling torque‚Äù but I‚Äôve associated it with the fact that normal torque by heli causes change in yawing and in PC it causes change in both yaw and roll depending on the system, although no one knows what‚Äôs causing the rolling in unpowered motor system it doesn‚Äôt really take away the fact that this is having a similar affect to torque nor does it take away the possibilities of the rotor creating the ‚Äúrolling torque‚Äù
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:24:47 With an increase in speed and with no counter roll system like in FireOblivions video it does start to roll violently, the rolling strength depends on how fast your rotor is spinning and how fast you‚Äôre going and yeah it‚Äôs easier to control, why would I build a non coaxial powered motor if i‚Äôm building a heli for normal flying and pvp
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:28:14 True but positioning of the rotor and blades matters

Like why would a tip jet rotor irl have no torque yet a helicopter irl does?
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:30:37 Tbh no idea if it‚Äôs a bug or not, everyone in PC have no idea what‚Äôs causing the rolling, could be anything
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:33:18 Seems as though explained in the first paragraph they said with the the tip jet rotor as having a tiny abit of torque but with the wind being redirect via the rudder? It cancels it out

And in the comments someone says due to Newton‚Äôs third law tip jet rotor creates no torque at all, tbh I‚Äôm too stupid to know irl physics and why certain things happen

OHHH WAIT I think due to the rotor itself spinning it does create torque but with the wind coming through the blades in opposite direction it cancels the torque out? I could be wrong here
creations-chat 2022-07-05 16:56:04 Also you can control the rolling perfectly fine
creations-chat 2022-07-05 17:00:14 It‚Äôs just a normal unpowered motor and there‚Äôs hover engines to make it spin
The rotor itself doesn‚Äôt generate any lift so there‚Äôs engines inside of the heli to create lift, make it pitch, yaw and roll <@706717603258957864>
help 2022-07-06 06:46:06 can u send a pic?
help 2022-07-06 06:47:38 when using piston locking it's recommended to wait like 4 ish seconds after activating the lock before locking or less it'll break, but if ur using half piston it'll always break since half pistons are broken
help 2022-07-06 06:55:31 when u say control surfaces keeps wobbling does it mean by the whole plane keeps moving up and down and wobbling or is it just the control surface being non responsive?
help 2022-07-06 06:57:06 best tip just from looking at this plane it's unresponsive prob due to the small amount of control surfaces
help 2022-07-06 06:57:22 the wobbling of the whole plane prob occurs due to the plane being unstable
help 2022-07-06 06:58:17 tbh most time the mass and lift indicators dont usually help
help 2022-07-06 06:58:24 just gatta go off feeling
help 2022-07-06 06:58:43 when ur mouse if in the middle of ur screen and ur plane isn't drooping or pitching up
help 2022-07-06 06:58:47 it should be fine
help 2022-07-06 06:59:06 use either helium or ballast blocks
help 2022-07-06 07:00:24 also if it still doesn't work and the control surfaces are unresponsive, might as well just make your own rudder, and ailerons
help 2022-07-06 07:01:58 just add motors or motor 2
help 2022-07-06 07:03:26 nah just normal wings
help 2022-07-06 07:03:34 lemme get on the game build one and show u

creations-chat 2022-07-16 12:40:40 Jesus, doesn't even look like plane crazy anymore
oh it's fake <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 12:44:02 Thought they went all out and made the nose out of trails
would be insane to see a plane or jet with trail nose with that degree of detail
creations-chat 2022-07-16 12:46:12 yeah sadge <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>  thought someone finally broke through the blocky era of planes and started making photo realistic jets
no matter how good there are definitely some part that seems off or blocky imo
creations-chat 2022-07-16 12:56:45 wait maybe he did use trail or something, check out 16clampa's f-15 showcase, the nose seems pretty similar
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:00:20 ahh damn <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:02:38 YEAH IT'S WHAT I MEANT IT LOOKS SO SIMILAR THO <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
though it is pretty rough
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:04:50 looks like he made a normal nose with angle locking and then used a pencil sharpener <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:14:04 tbh it's not bad, it's just hella impractical

saving that whenever i see someone with the worst nose in existence
creations-chat 2022-07-16 13:30:25 maybe talk abit more and level up, post a build and then maybe you'll have proof to get the rank also read <#925522972586967092>
that's too well edited <@657846484397719553>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 14:15:30 might just be me but the wings seems to be abit too big

creations-chat 2022-07-16 14:28:00 too little amount of wedge / wing pannels to have that smooth of a nose seems like

creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:02:11 Bored, been tinkering around thoughts on this?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:04:35 top view (ignore **configure to**)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:08:44 will totally fix it by adding something to shape the whole canopy

<@873696499513561088>tbh idk, im going off of a F35 since i could never get the cockpit or canopy right so i could turn it into an f35 who knows
i finally got the lines to have elavation without breaking the custom angle
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:25:16 Progress for tonight, canopy will be fixed later (hopefully i can)
<@706717603258957864> and <@685909594932773033>No bobus to activate windows <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
there's a cracked version but i'd rather not
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:32:16 oh yeah, the glass part isn't cylinder
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:53:53 Could prob make it shorter but might be a pain to move some stuff
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:56:16 was going for an F35
creations-chat 2022-08-06 17:59:57 always dreamt of making this type of sharp nose and now i am somewhat skilled enough to get it
creations-chat 2022-08-06 18:06:42 Steep line (1block) or (0.5)?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 18:09:12 alr ty
creations-chat 2022-08-06 18:11:23 Better angle, srry for the bad angle and pic spamming, just lookin for feedback rn (still 0.5? the top, i could hide motors i think)
second is 1 block steep lol
creations-chat 2022-08-07 03:01:16 Thoughts on this so far?
creations-chat 2022-08-07 03:05:15 F35

Tbh this was just something I was tinkering with and just looked up F35 and just started building so I‚Äôm in too deep to choose a variation at this point LOL

creations-chat 2022-08-07 05:22:37 My brain is fried

creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:28:14 Both intakes done
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:38:29 idk im just building usually never measure
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:40:55 yeah i like longer nose B)
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:44:10 yeah kinda hard to get it more round with the space i have to work with plus with roblox being blocky

<@697793017331056732>ty, it's something i always wanted to try and get right and this is my best attempt so far
creations-chat 2022-08-07 06:47:09 it's somewhat close to 1 to 1 abit on the bigger side compared to my character
creations-chat 2022-08-07 10:10:35 Thoughts on this?
<@683015364975657024>F35
creations-chat 2022-08-07 10:16:07 Maybe you're not opening ur eyes correctly, the intake has an inward shaped with the top and side curving slightly, wings are abit off but prob wouldn't look exact unless i angle lock it which is fillin up most of my space and comparing the vertical wings it seems to be pretty proportional with the picture i have and comparing it to the actual build itself
creations-chat 2022-08-07 10:19:08 Gently?????
creations-chat 2022-08-08 12:51:23 I shortened the nose abit, thoughts on this or should it still need to be short?
creations-chat 2022-08-08 12:53:28 not really choosing one since i have trouble following details so im just building what an image of an F35 is off of my mind
I'll try shortening it by another block
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:22:35 A lot of angle locking and piston locking with wedges
creations-chat 2022-08-08 15:39:05 As per request some people still think the nose is abit long, so i shortened it even more, bottom pic is short short top pic is just **Short** which one is better?
<@793132196810588200>Gotcha, still got alot more to fix tho like the wing shape and i can't get it perfectly right unless i angle lock <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:10:41 Need opinion for elavators, left or right, dont bash me for the wings i know they're off pls <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-08-08 16:14:24 Fixed the hole on the right that was bothering me and here's a close up of what they look like when pitching, still right?

creations-chat 2022-09-30 00:51:07 I could try to make it like that
creations-chat 2022-09-30 07:06:50 Tried making a non cylinder canopy thoughts?
sure gimme a sec
creations-chat 2022-09-30 07:09:59 A far one since my mic is blocking too much
forgot sorry lmao
creations-chat 2022-09-30 07:12:07 Here's a side top ish one aswell
Yeah, instead of full on cylinder it's half. someone said instead of full on cylinder it's half with side wedges so i tried it
creations-chat 2022-09-30 07:15:21 Tried going for one already and failed so trying the F22 now lol
creations-chat 2022-09-30 07:21:20 Yeah, looks like a pigeon
creations-chat 2022-10-01 14:19:25 Tried making lining in the canopy, best i can do rn thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-10-01 14:24:15 Spend months in a cave pondering and a few more months trying and failing <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-10-01 14:29:14 Going for an F22, i made an F35 with the same nose in creation but felt too lazy to put details and angle lock so now i promised myself to take it slow with this one
creations-chat 2022-10-01 15:41:10 **activate windows**
creations-chat 2022-10-01 15:46:21 To put simply, 2 angles on 1 part of the nose, changing it vertically and horizontally with camera stopping it at a certain point, though that said it took me a few days to get it right
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:41:52 cool submarine
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:47:09 doesn't look steep enough at the top nose
If you're going for a triangle wedge nose then i'd say remake the angle for everything for it all to blend better
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:49:30 Yes <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> i know how hard it is with my recent pic
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:54:28 **Cries from not knowing how to make ez intake**
already did them for the nose and everything currently in the pic apart from seat and i dont wanna do more <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2022-10-06 11:56:53 it's usually what i do with most of my intake but most of the time they either break alot cus of piston or just take too much space plus it pains me greatly to spend so much time on intakes

Looking much better <@774187759593193482> i'd say maybe abit more angle to make a ramp with the front of the triangle wedge?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:03:02 also any thoughts on anything i could possibly change about the nose <@744591826891046943>
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:26:20 could raise it but im also kinda inside a motor so would it really matter lmfao

Thoughts <@744591826891046943>
creations-chat 2022-10-06 12:56:13 it's an easy fix, just a few pistons to push him over the top<:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>  just focusin on the intake for now
creations-chat 2022-10-06 14:42:21 prob just the fact that i took a weird angle just so you could see the intake
<@448677698773057547>semi cylinder with wedge since nothing else seems good
creations-chat 2022-10-06 14:47:24 i wanted the rounded top with the ramp ish effect of the canopy instead of hard edges
also <@744591826891046943> Here's final product, pistons lock kinda broke and ima prob mess around with the setting on em to make it cleaner hopefully ( expose motor lock on the top abit which isn't fixable unless i take out the inner part of the intake)

creations-chat 2022-10-29 09:21:27 unless you'll have alot of space for a custom nose then might as well just do a normal angle locked nose
creations-chat 2022-10-29 09:24:13 Go for a nose similar to this then, just change the angle correctly to fit the F35 since this is the easiest (cockpit is up to u)
creations-chat 2022-10-29 09:26:27 or u can try making this lmfao

what's wrong with it<@935365256795025450> Huh? wym by got hit by 2 truck in opposite direction
Yeah the wings are just a test as u can see i've only done 1 side of it
creations-chat 2022-11-16 15:00:28 here's an old one but is the same one in the pic, just without the body
yeah idk if i can hide the motor without takin to much space but im figurin out some other stuff for now
creations-chat 2022-11-16 15:05:13 if I do that it'll look more like an F35 as seen with this pic
