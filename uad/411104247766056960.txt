general 2021-06-10 15:17:39 Gasoline (/ˈɡæsəliːn/) or petrol (/ˈpɛtrəl/) (see the etymology for naming differences and the use of the term gas) is a transparent, petroleum-derived flammable liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in most spark-ignited internal combustion engines. It consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of additives. On average, a 160-liter (42-U.S.-gallon) barrel of crude oil can yield up to about 72 liters (19 U.S. gallons) of gasoline after processing in an oil refinery, depending on the crude oil assay and on what other refined products are also extracted.[1] The characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating, which is produced in several grades. Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds, once widely used to increase octane rating, are no longer used in most areas (they are still used in aviation[2] and off-road and auto-racing applications[3]). Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness, and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as ethanol, MTBE, or ETBE to improve combustion.

Gasoline can enter the environment uncombusted, both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport, and delivery (e.g., from storage tanks, from spills, etc.). As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks.[4] Gasoline contains benzene and other known carcinogens[5][6][7] and causes over 100 thousand premature deaths every year.[8] Burning a litre of gasoline emits over 2 kg of CO
2, which causes climate change.

general 2021-06-11 08:57:52 God is among us—and is personally involved in our lives and actively guiding His children.

Throughout the ages, God has spoken through His servants, the prophets.1 This morning we have had the privilege to hear the prophet of God speak to all the world. We love you, President Nelson, and I encourage everyone everywhere to study and heed your words.

Before I reached my 12th birthday, our family had been forced twice to flee our home and start over amid the chaos, fear, and uncertainties caused by war and political division. It was an anxious time for me, but it must have been terrifying for my beloved parents.

general 2021-12-30 10:58:07 or im just too lazy to do detailing
general 2021-12-30 10:58:14 7 blocks wide
general 2021-12-30 10:58:43 6 blocks tall i think
general 2021-12-30 10:58:59 and i forgot the height
general 2021-12-30 10:59:20 plus the tank itself is like 1 and a half year old
general 2021-12-30 11:00:40 nvm mines 9 blocks wide
general 2021-12-30 11:04:32 you use apple because you are a sheep

general 2021-12-30 11:06:02 <@!559568621312147476> you should make a m48/60

general 2021-12-30 11:09:29 now turn it into a 2a4 B)
general 2021-12-30 11:09:44 we can do leopard 2a4 shenanigans
general 2021-12-30 11:16:18 the reason why i made my leopard was because boxness was gonna do a 'in leo we trust' vid and he asked me with a bunch of other people to make one but for some reason he scrapped the project
general 2021-12-30 11:16:34 xd
general 2021-12-30 11:17:21 a bunch of other people was making their leos too

general 2022-01-03 00:48:10 30%
general 2022-01-03 00:48:13 at most
general 2022-01-03 00:48:47 "30 feet with the gun forwards. Width was nearly 12 feet while height was 10 feet, 6.5 inches"
general 2022-01-03 00:49:13 i dont fucking remember
general 2022-01-03 00:49:33 but if you look at the image
general 2022-01-03 00:50:16 yeah from the sides the turret looks
general 2022-01-03 00:50:18 ehhhhh
general 2022-01-03 00:50:59 then it would look really unpoportional
general 2022-01-03 00:51:13 i forgot
general 2022-01-03 00:51:22 but when i did the thing
general 2022-01-03 00:51:41 i assumed that the av was the same height as the woman
general 2022-01-03 00:52:04 literally cant make it narrower
general 2022-01-03 00:52:16 the shit in the turret just cant
general 2022-01-03 00:52:46 not restart
general 2022-01-03 00:52:52 its literally almost impossible
general 2022-01-03 00:53:21 there are so much motorlock shit making it smaller would be a nightmare
general 2022-01-03 00:54:13 that is the smallest i could get it without ruining the build
general 2022-01-03 00:55:52 if i can improve i would make it 2 blocks thinner by removing these 2 blocks on the turret
general 2022-01-03 00:56:13 but that would ruin it
general 2022-01-03 00:58:00 yeah ill go fuck myself with that
general 2022-01-03 00:58:17 the turret took me

creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:25:26 not being able to tell WIP and addendum and then accusing the guy of posting a WIP is nowhere close to “understandable”
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:29:38 adding something on to a complete build does not make make that build WIP. someone adding something to his finished build doesnt make the build before that “WIP”
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:32:48 having a house under construction makes it WIP, so does adding a new window to that house after it is completed still makes it WIP?
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:39:02 there is no “completion”. you constantly improve on your work that doesnt make such work “WIP”
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:42:06 if everything goes by your point, then completion will never exist
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:44:48 it is “completed”. the phase where i plug the console in and set it up makes it “WIP”. when i need to install an update or a new game, its an addon, an addendum
creations-chat 2022-01-09 08:48:36 i think you dropped your book king

general 2022-01-21 14:42:52 yes
general 2022-01-21 14:42:55 that too
general 2022-01-21 14:43:25 i tried to make a 1:1 panther A
general 2022-01-21 14:43:47 by making a 3x1.5 mantlet
general 2022-01-21 14:43:48 wait
general 2022-01-21 14:43:50 lemme get
general 2022-01-21 14:48:08 sorry i lost it
general 2022-01-21 14:48:12 gave up
general 2022-01-21 14:48:15 was too hard
general 2022-01-21 14:48:33 but the entire thing was a 1.5 block tall turret
general 2022-01-21 14:49:07 the mantlet took up 70% of the space in the turret
general 2022-01-21 14:52:06 basically the mantlet looks like this
general 2022-01-21 14:52:21 which is 500% harder than it looks
general 2022-01-21 14:57:18 
general 2022-01-21 14:58:35 it moves
general 2022-01-21 14:58:36 plus
general 2022-01-21 14:59:18 there cannot be anything in this space because it collides with the roof
general 2022-01-21 14:59:38 so everything needs to be tucked in horizontally
general 2022-01-21 14:59:54 plus the space constraints of the turret’s shape

general 2022-01-29 08:15:17 looks like a spin breach
general 2022-01-29 08:15:25 but its way too small for one
general 2022-01-29 08:15:44 what
general 2022-01-29 08:16:21 how many shells can you fire
general 2022-01-29 08:16:31 oh damn
general 2022-01-29 08:17:24 so the tnt actually comes out of the underside of the barrel right?
general 2022-01-29 08:17:46 and wdym by using half pistons?
general 2022-01-29 08:17:55 to help with the reloading?

general 2022-01-29 08:22:04 chicken butt
general 2022-01-29 08:22:36 hackering
general 2022-01-29 08:23:21 so
general 2022-01-29 08:23:39 this is a more functional version of it
general 2022-01-29 08:23:40 but its alot bigger
general 2022-01-29 08:24:06 but
general 2022-01-29 08:24:13 if you know how to fit them
general 2022-01-29 08:24:24 they only take up a 5x5 space
general 2022-01-29 08:24:32 thats the smallest it can get
general 2022-01-29 08:24:49 because there are moving parts

general 2022-01-29 09:04:22 so i sniped him 5 times over
general 2022-01-29 09:04:33 and the dude just started barking shit
general 2022-01-29 09:04:53 he kept telling me he has a six figure job
general 2022-01-29 09:05:02 like it mattered on a roblox game???
general 2022-01-29 09:58:40 are you currently grinding for the event
general 2022-01-29 09:59:56 imagine having to aim
general 2022-01-29 10:00:53 aphe mains when they have to play solid shots
general 2022-01-29 10:01:04 this post was made by the T34 gang
general 2022-01-29 10:03:33 i have calculated that
general 2022-01-29 10:03:45 to complete the event (getting the tank)
general 2022-01-29 10:03:56 you would need to do 23 victories a day
general 2022-01-29 10:04:02 for 9 days straight
general 2022-01-29 10:04:43 so say if you have a 50% WR
general 2022-01-29 10:05:02 that would be 46 battles per day
general 2022-01-29 10:05:38 thats grindier than 2019’s christmas event
general 2022-01-29 10:07:24 just
general 2022-01-29 10:07:25 hh
general 2022-01-29 10:07:36 its like 39 battles a day
general 2022-01-29 10:07:44 theoretically
general 2022-01-29 10:08:05 i would recommend tryharding and seal clubbing
general 2022-01-29 10:08:24 because as far as i know the event tank is pretty OP

general 2022-01-30 09:46:42 the one thing about osbes that i really like is the fake rain reflection

general 2022-01-31 11:48:24 the mini is a rally car, not a sports car
general 2022-01-31 11:50:06 the john cooper works looks
general 2022-01-31 11:50:30 overdone
general 2022-01-31 11:50:32 like
general 2022-01-31 11:50:45 too much
general 2022-01-31 11:50:59 the clubman is just a very obese mini
general 2022-01-31 11:51:12 country man is mildly fat
general 2022-01-31 11:51:29 imo 5 door mini and 2 door mini best
general 2022-01-31 11:52:45 comparing minis is like comparing the porsche cayman, cayenne and panamera
general 2022-01-31 11:52:59 they are the same car
general 2022-01-31 11:53:04 more like the same chassis
general 2022-01-31 11:53:14 but they serve different purposes
general 2022-01-31 11:53:31 cayenne is the SUV
general 2022-01-31 11:53:36 off-road car
general 2022-01-31 11:53:46 the macan is like a feminine cayenne
general 2022-01-31 11:54:11 and the pana is like a sedan crossover thing
general 2022-01-31 11:54:32 (my dad has a cayenne)
general 2022-01-31 11:54:40 (i crashed it)
general 2022-01-31 11:54:59 no

general 2022-01-31 12:03:28 <:BIG1:588443768806703124>
general 2022-01-31 12:03:37 just to get some weight off my head i guess
general 2022-01-31 12:04:04 <@!451025784228806656> but i bet the chances of me getting a car after 18 is like 20%

general 2022-03-24 04:51:50 why
general 2022-03-24 04:56:56 ghe
general 2022-03-24 04:57:02 the m47 is like
general 2022-03-24 04:57:09 a m46 and a bulldog
general 2022-03-24 04:57:28 so its a m46 with slightly better armor
general 2022-03-24 04:57:36 and more decent mobility
general 2022-03-24 04:57:54 the m48 is kinda like the m46 and a t26e5

general 2022-03-24 04:58:42 the m47 can go 15 in reverse
general 2022-03-24 04:58:49 but the m48 can only go 8
general 2022-03-24 04:59:01 so its just mobility or armor

general 2022-04-05 03:02:55 idk why but i prefer discrete pc setups more
general 2022-04-05 03:03:39 
general 2022-04-05 03:03:45 they are low profile
general 2022-04-05 03:04:00 something like that
general 2022-04-05 03:07:15 
general 2022-04-05 03:09:22 pcc mods
general 2022-04-05 03:10:22 if you load windows on this thing i heard its a monster of a machine
general 2022-04-05 03:10:27 for its price
general 2022-04-05 03:10:48 not really
general 2022-04-05 03:11:32 the midtier one beats out most other builds
general 2022-04-05 03:11:44 it’s kinda like a do it all machine
general 2022-04-05 03:14:37 some people do that
general 2022-04-05 03:14:47 like a jack of all trades
general 2022-04-05 03:15:18 i have a m1 pro
general 2022-04-05 03:15:22 and let me tell you
general 2022-04-05 03:15:29 its a monster at gaming
general 2022-04-05 03:15:49 like
general 2022-04-05 03:16:03 war thunder on movie graphics at 130 fps
general 2022-04-05 03:17:07 full screen
general 2022-04-05 03:17:20 the screen is pretty sharp
general 2022-04-05 03:17:25 so im guessing its like
general 2022-04-05 03:17:30 1920x something
general 2022-04-05 03:17:50 for a laptop
general 2022-04-05 03:17:59 i would say its really good
general 2022-04-05 03:18:09 best thing is
general 2022-04-05 03:18:13 on a full charge
general 2022-04-05 03:18:20 it lasts like 4 hours
general 2022-04-05 03:18:48 90-120
general 2022-04-05 03:19:01 it only spikes when theres alot going on
general 2022-04-05 03:19:24 the fans are really silent
general 2022-04-05 03:19:34 it stays pretty cool all the time
general 2022-04-05 03:19:45 and the screen is just
general 2022-04-05 03:19:49 beautiful
general 2022-04-05 03:19:59 my hand
general 2022-04-05 03:20:10 i would say its
general 2022-04-05 03:20:13 warm
general 2022-04-05 03:20:16 not too hot
general 2022-04-05 03:20:18 like
general 2022-04-05 03:20:22 40 degrees
general 2022-04-05 03:20:26 c
general 2022-04-05 03:20:51 the underside is really hot
general 2022-04-05 03:21:30 true true
general 2022-04-05 03:21:42 gaming laptops are like
general 2022-04-05 03:21:46 5kgs
general 2022-04-05 03:22:01 its like doing curls every time you carry it
general 2022-04-05 03:22:26 that’s another reason why i like my mbp so much
general 2022-04-05 03:23:06 <@!622607246257422356>

general 2022-04-05 03:24:20 suggest me
general 2022-04-05 03:24:26 isnt wt like
general 2022-04-05 03:24:32 really gpu intensive
general 2022-04-05 03:24:39 i can just run crossover
general 2022-04-05 03:24:45 it lets me run exe files
general 2022-04-05 03:25:05 but it does kneecap my performance a bit
general 2022-04-05 03:26:08 <@!877391100137070625> maybe i could run cyberpunk <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-04-05 03:27:34 ok so
general 2022-04-05 03:27:40 because of compatibility issues
general 2022-04-05 03:27:49 it will probably cut the performance in half
general 2022-04-05 03:27:55 like gta 5
general 2022-04-05 03:28:05 runs at like 30-40 fps
general 2022-04-05 03:28:28 its not the machine issue its a software thing
general 2022-04-05 03:28:33 so fuck
general 2022-04-05 03:29:33 not compatible
general 2022-04-05 03:29:40 only cinebench is

general 2022-04-30 15:36:27 yeah but its the only competitor to the macbook
general 2022-04-30 15:36:54 
general 2022-04-30 15:37:02 no
general 2022-04-30 15:37:07 and hp laptops are
general 2022-04-30 15:37:08 shit
general 2022-04-30 15:37:26 samsung phone loses their value after like 2 months
general 2022-04-30 15:37:55 and they get phased out super quickly
general 2022-04-30 15:38:04 not good for long term use
general 2022-04-30 15:38:11 its good with gimmicks sure
general 2022-04-30 15:38:18 but its not reliable in any way
general 2022-04-30 15:38:43 what the fuck do you mean
general 2022-04-30 15:38:47 i have a iphone 7
general 2022-04-30 15:38:52 i got it since it came out
general 2022-04-30 15:38:55 still uses fine
general 2022-04-30 15:39:03 even though i dropped it
general 2022-04-30 15:39:07 dipped it in water
general 2022-04-30 15:40:05 💀
general 2022-04-30 15:41:06 70k fine for bringing on planes <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-04-30 15:41:43 i didnt compare them with flagship iphones 💀
general 2022-04-30 15:42:11 you can literally go and get a XR for 400 bucks
general 2022-04-30 15:42:26 and they would be so much more reliable and long term than 80% of android phones
general 2022-04-30 15:44:13 you dont need to buy a new iphone to enjoy it
general 2022-04-30 15:44:14 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2022-04-30 15:44:44 older iphones go chin to chin with midrange androids
general 2022-04-30 15:45:02 same
general 2022-04-30 15:45:08 i dont really use
general 2022-04-30 15:45:14 cable headphones anymore
general 2022-04-30 15:45:29 when they decided to strangle me once
general 2022-04-30 15:45:57 i only use cable headphones for desktops
general 2022-04-30 15:46:15 carrying it with a phone is bulkier than wireless headphones
general 2022-04-30 15:47:06 i think thats you not paying attention to your surroundings
general 2022-04-30 15:47:08 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-04-30 15:49:25 and putting the case in your pocket
general 2022-04-30 15:49:48 fr thats so annoying

general 2022-04-30 15:52:45 i dont want to untangle my headphones every 10 minutes
general 2022-04-30 15:53:19 thats not the point
general 2022-04-30 15:53:25 the point is
general 2022-04-30 15:53:31 they get tangled easily
general 2022-04-30 15:53:37 and is a fucking hassle to use
general 2022-04-30 15:54:08 you are so fucking dense jesus
general 2022-04-30 15:54:53 
general 2022-04-30 15:54:55 this

general 2022-04-30 15:56:24 doesnt phones take time to charge
general 2022-04-30 15:56:34 doesnt laptops takes time to charge
general 2022-04-30 15:57:05 its so whiny to cherrypick a problem that is so small it makes you look like a fucking todler
general 2022-04-30 15:57:22 get 2 charger cables??
general 2022-04-30 15:57:29 just go to sleep
general 2022-04-30 15:57:32 plug them in
general 2022-04-30 15:57:36 wake up next day
general 2022-04-30 15:57:38 use them
general 2022-04-30 15:58:16 and wireless headphones gets like 30 hours of case battery anyways
general 2022-04-30 15:58:25 you are the one that brought this up
general 2022-04-30 15:58:31 wtf is your point 💀
general 2022-04-30 15:58:57 this monkey trying to tell me how using wired headphones is more ergonomic than wireless
general 2022-04-30 15:59:17 it’s because i hate looking at dumbasses
general 2022-04-30 15:59:40 at how they convince people about their shitty way of life
general 2022-04-30 16:00:40 the goal of ergonomics is to remove discomfort during use
general 2022-04-30 16:00:49 which is basically wireless headphones
general 2022-04-30 16:01:36 talking from experience
general 2022-04-30 16:01:50 i got strangled by wired earbuds once
general 2022-04-30 16:01:57 sleeping on the bus
general 2022-04-30 16:02:05 woke up with them around my neck
general 2022-04-30 16:02:22 just from me shuffling around
general 2022-04-30 16:03:08 i drive cars everyday and didn’t die
general 2022-04-30 16:03:16 im just really lucky
general 2022-04-30 16:04:47 but you can
general 2022-04-30 16:05:02 and the chances of being strangled by airpods are 0
general 2022-04-30 16:05:18 + they are way easier to use
general 2022-04-30 16:06:03 mf said this
general 2022-04-30 16:06:09 is better than this
general 2022-04-30 16:06:17 because its “easier to use”
general 2022-04-30 16:06:30 fucking neanderthal

general 2022-05-06 16:53:13 🤨
general 2022-05-06 17:02:41 
general 2022-05-06 17:16:58 porshe
general 2022-05-06 17:36:50 especially the porsche
general 2022-05-06 17:36:50 <@403843930543882241> whats the best gear setups for highways
general 2022-05-06 17:37:17 highway
general 2022-05-06 17:37:46 the one that im always on
general 2022-05-06 17:37:47 s
general 2022-05-06 17:38:23 so higher speeds
general 2022-05-06 17:38:29 but lower accel
general 2022-05-06 17:39:12 <@403843930543882241> how about higher accel in lower gears but higher speeds in the higher gears
general 2022-05-06 17:39:16 if that’s possible
general 2022-05-06 17:39:45 so the first 1,2 and 3 gears focuses on accel
general 2022-05-06 17:40:03 and the 4th and 5th gear focuses on top speed
general 2022-05-06 17:40:34 so i wont change the 4th and 5th gear
general 2022-05-06 17:40:59 the porsche only has 5 gears
general 2022-05-06 17:41:03 thats the thing
general 2022-05-06 17:41:16 so shorter 1,2,3
general 2022-05-06 17:41:25 4,5 is kept the same
general 2022-05-06 17:42:10 
general 2022-05-06 17:42:42 IM FUCKING INVINCIBLE
general 2022-05-06 17:44:10 evolution
general 2022-05-06 17:45:25 <@403843930543882241> maybe for the shrine pass ill use the lotus
general 2022-05-06 17:45:33 for a more handling focused car
general 2022-05-06 17:46:11 i heard the lotus has pretty good handling around corners
general 2022-05-06 17:47:00 how
general 2022-05-06 17:47:14 dont ping the poor guy
general 2022-05-06 17:47:19 hes not a photographer

general 2022-05-06 18:01:19 but the 3rd gear is oddly long

general 2022-05-07 03:29:22 it has faster accel
general 2022-05-07 03:29:33 and is more agile in turns
general 2022-05-07 03:29:55 the top speed of the nissan is still higher thi
general 2022-05-07 03:30:05 its like
general 2022-05-07 03:30:06 290
general 2022-05-07 03:30:12 the supra is 280 ish
general 2022-05-07 03:30:31 <@403843930543882241> i did some gearing
general 2022-05-07 03:30:39 the 123 gears are short
general 2022-05-07 03:30:48 but 4th gear is abnormally long
general 2022-05-07 03:31:03 but if i make it shorter i have to adjust all the gears
general 2022-05-07 03:31:30 i changed the first gear ratio from 2.77 to 5 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-05-07 03:31:44 it accelerates faster than a Tesla now
general 2022-05-07 03:33:39 yeah
general 2022-05-07 03:33:52 i messed up the gear ratios
general 2022-05-07 03:34:07 gonna make it lower
general 2022-05-07 03:34:15 like maybe a 3 or 3.5
general 2022-05-07 03:34:20 instead of 5
general 2022-05-07 03:34:39 you cant
general 2022-05-07 03:34:43 trust me ive tried
general 2022-05-07 03:35:06 
general 2022-05-07 03:36:08 yup
general 2022-05-07 03:36:19 saving for testa next
general 2022-05-07 03:36:31 10m yen
general 2022-05-07 03:37:10 this car still hot tho
general 2022-05-07 03:38:00 it goes slower
general 2022-05-07 03:38:11 but for the nissan i dont think that really matters
general 2022-05-07 03:38:40 the final gears are for long straights
general 2022-05-07 03:38:47 and you barely use it
general 2022-05-07 03:38:59 5th gear is already faster than 70% of the cars ingame
general 2022-05-07 03:39:13 p
general 2022-05-07 03:39:19 final gear
general 2022-05-07 03:39:24 (6th gear)
general 2022-05-07 03:39:33 your mom
general 2022-05-07 03:39:41 ok so
general 2022-05-07 03:39:58 
general 2022-05-07 03:41:36 rally car
general 2022-05-07 03:42:24 soft suspension makes hitting curbs more comfortable and controllable anyways

general 2022-05-07 03:42:42 tanmk game
general 2022-05-07 03:42:57 but if you do hit a curb
general 2022-05-07 03:43:00 its not as bad
general 2022-05-07 03:43:22 i paid 3.5m yen for the gears
general 2022-05-07 03:43:24 😎
general 2022-05-07 04:26:03 the countach is not really the meta

general 2022-05-07 04:34:27 testa better
general 2022-05-07 04:34:32 the gears are smoother
general 2022-05-07 04:34:45 but the handling is sufficient at least
general 2022-05-07 04:34:52 <@720891502108344360> very expensive
general 2022-05-07 04:34:54 both of them

general 2022-06-04 04:13:00 did you buy the 75
general 2022-06-04 04:13:13 <@874912257128136734> or maybe research blueprints
general 2022-06-04 04:13:23 they have some pretty broken stuff in there
general 2022-06-04 04:16:25 
general 2022-06-04 04:16:44 dont blow it all on t1
general 2022-06-04 04:20:11 actually thats a good setup
general 2022-06-04 04:20:16 can i survive hits
general 2022-06-04 04:20:24 that turret is pretty busted
general 2022-06-04 04:27:21 cramped turret
general 2022-06-04 04:27:30 low reload multiplier
general 2022-06-04 04:28:02 <@874912257128136734> big turret = better reload multiplier
general 2022-06-04 04:28:20 autoloaders have the best multiplier i think
general 2022-06-04 04:28:21 like
general 2022-06-04 04:28:23 3x
general 2022-06-04 04:28:35 it can reload a 150mm in 15 seconds
general 2022-06-04 04:28:45 you only unlock them until tier 5
general 2022-06-04 04:28:47 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-06-04 04:29:13 calvary 2021
general 2022-06-04 04:29:28 in the blueprints section
general 2022-06-04 04:29:41 yeah
general 2022-06-04 04:29:59 it has pretty weird armor
general 2022-06-04 04:30:09 190
general 2022-06-04 04:32:17 NO
general 2022-06-04 04:32:21 ITS TRASH
general 2022-06-04 04:33:32 <@720891502108344360>
general 2022-06-04 04:33:43 for t2
general 2022-06-04 04:33:52 its either the centaur
general 2022-06-04 04:34:02 or the pz3 turret
general 2022-06-04 04:34:20 tbh
general 2022-06-04 04:34:24 for tier 1 and 2
general 2022-06-04 04:34:38 the stock 45mm is still broken as hell
general 2022-06-04 04:34:48 it has the second highest penetration for the tiers
general 2022-06-04 04:35:00 behind the 105 heat
general 2022-06-04 04:40:27 <@874912257128136734> tbh the kv2 turret has an insane reload multiplier so if you want to go apeshit this is a pretty good turret
general 2022-06-04 04:41:30 its more of a sniper turret
general 2022-06-04 04:44:28 <@874912257128136734> tbh this is the best setup i can think of
general 2022-06-04 04:44:39 it has decent protection and a potent gun
general 2022-06-04 04:45:10 for beta and alpha testers you get the Cromwheel and the BT-7 trackless
general 2022-06-04 04:45:42 this is my setup for t3
general 2022-06-04 04:45:56 its like war thunder but you can like
general 2022-06-04 04:46:01 mix and match parts
general 2022-06-04 04:46:11 
general 2022-06-04 04:46:21 yeah
general 2022-06-04 04:46:27 no shit
general 2022-06-04 04:46:58 i think they are just using the
general 2022-06-04 04:47:01 45mm
general 2022-06-04 04:48:04 yeah it can
general 2022-06-04 04:48:24 the trigonometry hull has some insane angles
general 2022-06-04 04:48:42 but you need to get used to shitty hull aiming
general 2022-06-04 04:48:51 HEAT shells are trash
general 2022-06-04 04:50:13 crafting parts
general 2022-06-04 04:50:33 blueprints
general 2022-06-04 04:51:51 
general 2022-06-04 04:53:21 elc turret is cramped

general 2022-07-09 04:08:47 android tablets are a next level of shit
general 2022-07-09 04:09:08 maybe some android phones could be better than iphones
general 2022-07-09 04:09:18 but android tablets are
general 2022-07-09 04:09:19 g
general 2022-07-09 04:10:13 no thats because iphones are high end phones
general 2022-07-09 04:10:20 they dont resell for low prices
general 2022-07-09 04:10:35 android phones doesnt last very long
general 2022-07-09 04:10:41 i used to have a S8
general 2022-07-09 04:10:48 died after a year of use
general 2022-07-09 04:11:00 so i switched to an iphone 11
general 2022-07-09 04:11:07 used it for 2 years
general 2022-07-09 04:11:12 never broke once
general 2022-07-09 04:11:15 or crash
general 2022-07-09 04:11:17 or stutter
general 2022-07-09 04:11:25 now i swapped to an iphone 12
general 2022-07-09 04:11:39 (its not)
general 2022-07-09 04:11:51 thats the 11 pro and max
general 2022-07-09 04:12:06 the 11 is just their "mid end" phone
general 2022-07-09 04:12:13 but i found out
general 2022-07-09 04:12:23 iphones are way more reliable than andrioids
general 2022-07-09 04:12:32 but androids are like
general 2022-07-09 04:12:34 more fun
general 2022-07-09 04:13:48 thats for phones below the 6s
general 2022-07-09 04:15:26 they do drain alot of power
general 2022-07-09 04:15:34 ipads
general 2022-07-09 04:16:40 yeah

general 2022-07-09 04:19:21 samsung kinda fell off
general 2022-07-09 04:19:30 they dont make good phones anymore
general 2022-07-09 04:19:39 all their top end phones are like the same
general 2022-07-09 04:19:58 if you are going to use an android
general 2022-07-09 04:20:03 dont use a samsung
general 2022-07-09 04:20:58 what
general 2022-07-09 04:21:11 eh
general 2022-07-09 04:21:27 top end phones are kinda specific
general 2022-07-09 04:21:46 and it looks like shit
general 2022-07-09 04:21:52 i tried it
general 2022-07-09 04:21:58 its overkill
general 2022-07-09 04:23:23 they are 2 different type of phones
general 2022-07-09 04:23:29 yet they kept being compared
general 2022-07-09 04:24:12 arrrgghh
general 2022-07-09 04:26:21 i dont understand why
general 2022-07-09 04:26:26 but a phone pen is kinda
general 2022-07-09 04:26:29 useless
general 2022-07-09 04:26:39 unless you are on a tablet
general 2022-07-09 04:26:55 the amount of people who have lost it
general 2022-07-09 04:27:30 i knew like 6 people who lost their s pen
general 2022-07-09 04:28:13 thats not always the case
general 2022-07-09 04:28:30 sometimes people just put their things down and forget about them
general 2022-07-09 04:29:00 that is fucking bs
general 2022-07-09 04:29:16 thats more time than a fucking laptop
general 2022-07-09 04:30:30 lo

general 2022-07-27 07:04:31 T-55 hull
general 2022-07-27 07:04:38 the turret is really good
general 2022-07-27 07:04:43 but it quite slow
general 2022-07-27 07:06:14 like
general 2022-07-27 07:06:16 really slow
general 2022-07-27 07:06:47 horizontal speed is like 9 degrees per second
general 2022-07-27 07:07:13 2nd slowest in the game
general 2022-07-27 07:07:16 behind the mause

general 2022-07-27 07:12:14

general 2022-07-27 07:12:46 quite broken
general 2022-07-27 07:13:00 but the recoil is
general 2022-07-27 07:13:02 xd
general 2022-07-27 07:15:10 several severe concussions
general 2022-07-27 07:16:27 saving for this

general 2022-07-27 07:40:26 yes
general 2022-07-27 07:40:56 the mask yes
general 2022-07-27 07:41:07 dont make the turret mask move
general 2022-07-27 07:41:26 it makes it over complicated
general 2022-07-27 07:41:37 use a disconnector stub
general 2022-07-27 07:41:47 because it can clip through the
general 2022-07-27 07:41:49 blocks
general 2022-07-27 07:42:53 also i got muted from tanmk
general 2022-07-27 07:43:05 (had to censor out the word)
general 2022-07-27 07:44:08 
general 2022-07-27 07:45:00 <@718409831639154718> do it like this
general 2022-07-27 07:46:29 so it doesnt collide
general 2022-07-27 07:47:15 it was a test
general 2022-07-27 07:47:16 s
general 2022-07-27 07:48:19 not worth it

general 2022-07-27 07:51:32 auuuugghhh
general 2022-07-27 07:53:43 they arent that bad
general 2022-07-27 07:53:48 T-44 is decent

general 2022-07-27 07:55:05 IS-3 better
general 2022-07-27 07:55:18 the turret can stop heat rounds
general 2022-07-27 07:55:21 sometimes
general 2022-07-27 07:55:58 the trollage begins
general 2022-07-27 07:56:24 tbh
general 2022-07-27 07:56:35 the M60 should be put at 7.3 with the leopard
general 2022-07-27 07:56:58 cus the tank is basically if the leopard sacrifices mobility for armor
general 2022-07-27 07:57:31 and the M48 should move down to 7.0 to make its armor actually viable
general 2022-07-27 07:59:08 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-H37Brzb9U
general 2022-07-27 08:00:04 im also saving up for this
general 2022-07-27 08:00:15 thermals at 8.0 ❤️
general 2022-07-27 08:02:32 
general 2022-07-27 08:04:24 tbh if you complain about heatfs in 6.3 you should also complain about how 1.0 swedish tanks has apds
general 2022-07-27 08:05:09 heatfs is unreliable as hell anyways
general 2022-07-27 08:06:06 the only good tank with heatfs is the M56
general 2022-07-27 08:06:13 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-07-27 08:16:56 i mean

general 2022-07-27 12:28:48 i love apfsds bending
general 2022-07-27 12:29:59 i once shot a tank in the lower plate and it somehow hit the ammo rack in the back of the turret
general 2022-07-27 12:30:02 💀
general 2022-07-27 12:31:25 tbh
general 2022-07-27 12:31:33 the best 1-2 setup is the stock tank
general 2022-07-27 12:31:44 with a M2 browning or the 40mm pom pom
general 2022-07-27 12:38:29 i got killed by a 1.0 swedish apds because he shot through my turret ring and detonated my ammo
general 2022-07-27 12:38:37 i was in a M60

general 2022-07-27 12:40:00 the only 2 enjoyable US tank so far is the jumbo pershing and the superpershing

general 2022-07-27 12:41:53 and IT-1s
general 2022-07-27 12:41:58 the dreaded it-1
general 2022-07-27 12:42:54 tbh
general 2022-07-27 12:42:59 the m60 should be 7.3
general 2022-07-27 12:43:27 its basically a slower leo with more armor

general 2022-09-01 11:14:08 this one has a 6.0L twin turbocharged v12
general 2022-09-01 11:14:31 and this one has a smaller 5.3L twin turbocharged V10
general 2022-09-01 11:15:48 they still share the same suspension
general 2022-09-01 11:15:50 gearbox
general 2022-09-01 11:15:59 and other things
general 2022-09-01 11:16:15 the v12 also has like ABS and TCS
general 2022-09-01 11:16:23 because its stupid powerful

general 2022-09-01 19:03:31 oh my fucking god
general 2022-09-01 19:04:23 ffrrrgrggrgrhgghm
general 2022-09-01 19:04:58 i think i will focus on the turret first
general 2022-09-01 19:05:13 50 composite
general 2022-09-01 19:05:21 thats 9 steel per composite
general 2022-09-01 19:05:26 9 steel is like
general 2022-09-01 19:05:31 32 coal
general 2022-09-01 19:05:37 so 32 times 50 is
general 2022-09-01 19:05:50 1600 coal
general 2022-09-01 19:05:56 you get 5 per crate
general 2022-09-01 19:06:07 so 1600 divided by 5 is
general 2022-09-01 19:06:28 320 common crates
general 2022-09-01 19:06:31 holy ass
general 2022-09-01 19:06:51 thats actually still cheaper than the l44
general 2022-09-01 19:06:55 the l44 took like

general 2022-09-05 12:51:50 <@559568621312147476> this is what magnet lock can do
general 2022-09-05 12:52:08 it allows you to make shit even smaller
general 2022-09-05 12:52:14 and detailed at the same time
general 2022-09-05 12:52:44

general 2022-09-06 11:19:54 
general 2022-09-06 11:41:11 wym
general 2022-09-06 11:41:24 are you playing 9-10
general 2022-09-06 11:42:20 you probably accidentally completed a daily quest
general 2022-09-06 11:42:45 like grinding the game now is so much easier than it used to be
general 2022-09-06 11:43:07 back then if you have a proper tier 10 setup it would still take you weeks to get another one
general 2022-09-06 11:43:24 but now i can probably pull it off in one sitting
general 2022-09-06 11:43:37 this is my current setup
general 2022-09-06 11:44:09 ye
general 2022-09-06 11:44:26 tbh you should try to go to tier 8
general 2022-09-06 11:44:42 and then wiggle you way up to tier 9-10
general 2022-09-06 11:45:51 you should get the universal turret
general 2022-09-06 11:45:56 in the blueprint section
general 2022-09-06 11:46:08 and the 20pdr
general 2022-09-06 11:46:13 or the french 105

general 2022-09-07 11:37:28 why didnt you
general 2022-09-07 11:37:31 buy the abrams hull
general 2022-09-07 11:37:39 its like objectively better
general 2022-09-07 11:40:57 <@832352865804484628> also apfsds bending also means that if ur turret is hit with a dart 9 times out of 10 it always bends into the hull killing you
general 2022-09-07 11:42:58 ye
general 2022-09-07 11:44:48 one downside of the hstvl set is that it cant carry alot of ammo
general 2022-09-07 11:45:08 with the stock gun its like 25 rounds
general 2022-09-07 13:14:58

general 2022-09-07 13:33:18 <@832352865804484628> u should buy chally 1 turret
general 2022-09-07 13:33:23 and make the challybrams 1
general 2022-09-07 13:40:11 i make a bit more
general 2022-09-07 13:41:25 
general 2022-09-07 13:42:32 prob the highest tiered tank that you have
general 2022-09-07 13:43:54 the speedster was so good
general 2022-09-07 13:44:02 its still usable at tier 10
general 2022-09-07 13:44:10 with the tow turret
general 2022-09-07 13:45:14 
general 2022-09-07 13:45:40 least edgy wehraboo

general 2022-09-07 13:48:07 <@832352865804484628> i have barely made any progress
general 2022-09-07 13:48:23 mmrmmrfhhfgfhfm
general 2022-09-07 13:48:48 its pretty ok
general 2022-09-07 13:48:55 the turret is gonna be shit tho
general 2022-09-07 13:49:03 or the gun
general 2022-09-07 13:49:10 depending on how you use it
general 2022-09-07 13:49:21 you are downtiering a hull
general 2022-09-07 13:50:25 like
general 2022-09-07 13:50:29 3
general 2022-09-07 13:50:52 this is still swaggy 💪
general 2022-09-07 13:51:09 no one knows how to pen a chally 2 turret
general 2022-09-07 13:51:17 except for a few people
general 2022-09-07 14:11:58 no
general 2022-09-07 14:12:39 i used to be able to downtier a tiger 2 down to 1-2
general 2022-09-07 14:12:47 or a maus at 3-4

general 2022-09-07 14:13:10 idk
general 2022-09-07 14:13:43 imo
general 2022-09-07 14:13:48 the hellcat is my favorite hull
general 2022-09-07 14:14:24 and is probably the best hull for 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8
general 2022-09-07 14:14:28 maybe even 9-10
general 2022-09-07 14:14:48 tiger 1 is not good
general 2022-09-07 14:14:52 bad armor
general 2022-09-07 14:16:31 m18

general 2022-09-09 18:20:04 i regret burning 12m on the chally 2 hull
general 2022-09-09 18:20:17 
general 2022-09-09 18:20:52 the armor is like good
general 2022-09-09 18:20:59 when its hull down
general 2022-09-09 18:21:07 or at long range
general 2022-09-09 18:21:20 the ammo is protected with 23mm of casing armor
general 2022-09-09 18:21:26 so spall cant blow it up
general 2022-09-09 18:21:49 <:cave:940473535774740531>
general 2022-09-09 18:22:20 but the mobility is kinda mediocre
general 2022-09-09 18:22:27 and the side armor isnt that good
general 2022-09-09 18:22:39 plus the lfp being only 100mm thick
general 2022-09-09 18:23:07 i mean the abrams has sideskirts
general 2022-09-09 18:23:13 so does the type 90
general 2022-09-09 18:23:21 it makes it a bit harder to hit

general 2022-10-06 03:05:22 war thunder edge
general 2022-10-06 03:05:24 look it up
general 2022-10-06 03:06:14 i dont make roscale tanks because they literally looks like fucking barbie jeeps with roblox avatars
general 2022-10-06 03:07:01 
general 2022-10-06 03:07:29 when your avatar is as wide as the turret itself
general 2022-10-06 03:08:32 building roscale shit is more confined
general 2022-10-06 03:08:36 you cant be flexible
general 2022-10-06 03:08:46 its only good if you are larping as an army
general 2022-10-06 03:09:02 other than that i dont see a reason to build a small tank
general 2022-10-06 03:10:50 <@559568621312147476> problem is that the roblox avatar is too wide
general 2022-10-06 03:11:10 they look too big next to “roscale” builds
general 2022-10-06 03:11:17 it makes them look pff
general 2022-10-06 03:11:18 off
general 2022-10-06 03:11:51 no my point is
general 2022-10-06 03:11:56 roscale builds
general 2022-10-06 03:11:58 looks like shit
general 2022-10-06 03:12:32 in some contexts yes
general 2022-10-06 03:12:40 they look good on their own
general 2022-10-06 03:12:51 but if you put an avatar next to them they become ass
general 2022-10-06 03:15:27 the only decent roscale build i had is the M60A3
general 2022-10-06 03:15:47 no they are no you cross eyed mf
general 2022-10-06 03:15:55 they are slimmer
general 2022-10-06 03:16:21 because their arm isnt the size of a FUCKING FRIDGE
general 2022-10-06 03:16:58 i used a short woman as scale
general 2022-10-06 03:17:40 she stood next to the tank
general 2022-10-06 03:17:49 she was slightly shorter than the hull is tall
general 2022-10-06 03:18:00 like a foot
general 2022-10-06 03:19:21 <@559568621312147476>
general 2022-10-06 03:20:12 3.3 meters
general 2022-10-06 03:20:16 i know
general 2022-10-06 03:20:21 thats my point
general 2022-10-06 03:20:28 tanks are fucking massive
general 2022-10-06 03:21:01 roblox avatars are ~1.55m in height
general 2022-10-06 03:21:07 same as that woman
general 2022-10-06 03:21:10 i think
general 2022-10-06 03:21:13 women are short
general 2022-10-06 03:21:32 that dude is probably >1.8
general 2022-10-06 03:22:11 cope
general 2022-10-06 03:22:22 used a tall guy as reference
general 2022-10-06 03:22:27 source: i made it up
general 2022-10-06 03:22:34 “case closed”
general 2022-10-06 03:24:03 and how tall is that baby
general 2022-10-06 03:25:31 how do you know that child is 1 meter tall
general 2022-10-06 03:26:42 the tank is 3.21 meters tall
general 2022-10-06 03:27:01 the turret and hull proportions is approximately 50%
general 2022-10-06 03:27:16 so that the hull is about 1.5-1.6 meters in height

general 2022-10-08 07:38:26 i mean shaders are fine
general 2022-10-08 07:38:33 but people are really overusing it
general 2022-10-08 07:41:27 people are really insecure about their builds enough to put shaders over it
general 2022-10-08 07:41:41 and the 8 year olds will instantly upvote
general 2022-10-08 07:42:54 10 graphics is ambient occlusion
general 2022-10-08 07:44:12 imo having good camera angles and image editing is much better than just slapping a krnl shader over it

general 2022-10-15 09:18:19 how to make EVA 01 in plane crazy
general 2022-10-15 09:20:19 
general 2022-10-15 09:24:20 evas arent inefficient they just use up alot of energy to control
general 2022-10-15 09:24:56 in the end of evangelion the evas basically are proven to last forever
general 2022-10-15 09:25:21 and when they go beserk even though they already ran out of energy
general 2022-10-15 09:26:30 the thing with JA is that its too mechanical
general 2022-10-15 09:26:49 when the evas are just humans but big so they are alot more flexible
general 2022-10-15 09:27:47 yeah but it kills ur sync rate = less control over the eva
general 2022-10-15 09:28:13 and the evas have the tendency to reject controls when it feels like it
general 2022-10-15 09:28:22 so its not like you can do that all the time
general 2022-10-15 09:31:22 play this

general 2022-11-12 08:54:50 but the relay speed between wires are limited
general 2022-11-12 09:03:15 you should like
general 2022-11-12 09:03:23 make a dome of detectors
general 2022-11-12 09:03:33 so that the detector doesnt go off twice
general 2022-11-12 09:04:12 like this
general 2022-11-12 09:06:13 make it a dome
general 2022-11-12 09:13:10 the boxness server:

general 2022-11-12 09:38:35 someone got hold of the bot
general 2022-11-12 09:38:38 and made it
general 2022-11-12 09:38:46 so that it nukes everyone
general 2022-11-12 09:38:51 except mods

general 2022-11-15 16:09:42 
general 2022-11-15 16:21:50 - added an interior/ general improvements to the cockpit 
- fixed the shoddy paint job
- fixed the wedge on the engine
- redid the spine to make it look better
- made it less laggy and faster, overall optimizations
- gave it aim-9 sidewinders
- added pylons for Phoenix Missiles
(next version may receive the VF-2 Bounty Hunter livery instead of the VF-84 Jolly Rogers livery)

general 2022-11-28 05:01:37 
general 2022-11-28 06:26:45 it works
general 2022-11-28 08:11:32 
general 2022-11-28 08:11:35 all of this shit to power a single iron generator
general 2022-11-28 08:11:44 my god
general 2022-11-28 08:51:49 im trying to create a fully automatic and self supplying iron generator
general 2022-11-28 08:52:00 it now runs off of water
general 2022-11-28 08:56:01 its a combination of immersive engineering
general 2022-11-28 08:56:05 the create mod
general 2022-11-28 08:56:14 and switches mod
general 2022-11-28 08:56:37 didnt know these mods were compatible
general 2022-11-28 08:57:09 
general 2022-11-28 08:57:17 this thing consumes so much fucking power
general 2022-11-28 08:57:26 just for like
general 2022-11-28 08:57:36 1 stack of iron per hour
general 2022-11-28 08:57:46 ok so
general 2022-11-28 08:57:53 the crusher wheel
general 2022-11-28 08:58:01 turns cobblestone into gravel
general 2022-11-28 08:58:11 so i made a cobblestone generator
general 2022-11-28 08:58:15 and a drill to break it
general 2022-11-28 08:59:08 the gravel
general 2022-11-28 08:59:12 falls down into the washer
general 2022-11-28 08:59:27 which turns it into iron nuggets and flint
general 2022-11-28 08:59:39 i filter out the flint using a smart funeel
general 2022-11-28 08:59:42 funnel
general 2022-11-28 08:59:50 the nuggets go into a basin
general 2022-11-28 09:00:01 which then gets compressed into an ingot
general 2022-11-28 09:00:35 but originally it ran off of a creative accumulator
general 2022-11-28 09:00:41 so it wasn’t really realistic
general 2022-11-28 09:00:50 so i made a diesel generator
general 2022-11-28 09:01:00 but it ran off of biodiesel
general 2022-11-28 09:01:15 and to make that i would need ethanol and plant oil
general 2022-11-28 09:01:28 + all the storage tanks and tubing
general 2022-11-28 09:02:46 i used garden cloches to automatically farm potatoes which is used to synthesize ethanol and hemp seeds which is used to make plant oil
general 2022-11-28 09:03:32 and then it goes into a processing unit where it is sorted and the leftover hemp fiber gets removed
general 2022-11-28 09:04:05 i know but its more fun
general 2022-11-28 09:06:18 also i hooked up to a transformer to convert the HV to MV and LV
general 2022-11-28 09:07:21 HV is used to run the main iron generator, MV is used to run the presser, refinery and squeezer, LV is used to run the garden cloche and lights
general 2022-11-28 09:08:29 its made with a triple redundancy system where without the generator running it can run for about 30 minutes to an hour with the accumulator, if that runs out then the windmill would turn the grid into low power mode
general 2022-11-28 09:09:05 i think thats it
general 2022-11-28 09:10:07 better than doing nothing 😎
general 2022-11-28 09:10:23 i will die

general 2022-11-29 08:42:30 yes
general 2022-11-29 08:42:33 thats the issue
general 2022-11-29 08:42:46 they dont give you the center
general 2022-11-29 08:43:03 but CB is in the middle
general 2022-11-29 08:43:08 so i think
general 2022-11-29 08:43:11 if we extend
general 2022-11-29 08:43:14 BC
general 2022-11-29 08:43:16 to like
general 2022-11-29 08:43:19 BY
general 2022-11-29 08:48:40 it is pointless
general 2022-11-29 08:49:02 BC is centered
general 2022-11-29 08:49:17 so if you add Y as an extension of BC
general 2022-11-29 08:49:21 you have BY
general 2022-11-29 08:49:47 1/2 of BY is the center

general 2022-11-30 11:49:36 but its slower
general 2022-11-30 11:49:48 the armor is better but its not because of heatfs

general 2022-12-16 09:51:11 magnet locking
general 2022-12-16 09:51:17 is ☠️
general 2022-12-16 09:51:30 but if you can get it to work out
general 2022-12-16 09:51:36 yields amazing results
general 2022-12-16 09:51:57 but honestly i cant be bothered to play this game anymore
general 2022-12-16 09:53:51 you gotta show it
general 2022-12-16 09:53:53 its very
general 2022-12-16 09:53:55 confusing
general 2022-12-16 09:54:05 motorlock
general 2022-12-16 09:54:10 then weld it with
general 2022-12-16 09:54:14 magnets
general 2022-12-16 09:54:17 and then update it
general 2022-12-16 09:54:34 like make it
general 2022-12-16 09:54:39 turn it on and off
general 2022-12-16 09:54:55 i remember thats how fellipe told me
general 2022-12-16 09:54:58 how it worked
general 2022-12-16 09:55:47 felipe
general 2022-12-16 09:55:50 and box
general 2022-12-16 09:55:54 but hes stupid
general 2022-12-16 09:56:15 felipe2049gamer
general 2022-12-16 09:56:21 i think thats his name
general 2022-12-16 09:56:48 i might get back into the game when i figure out magnet locking
general 2022-12-16 09:57:03 (pc2 is still atleast a year away)
general 2022-12-16 09:57:23 its angle locking minus the motors
general 2022-12-16 09:57:33 yeah
general 2022-12-16 09:57:52 how people figure that shit out is beyond me
general 2022-12-16 09:58:12 a build thats unloaded
general 2022-12-16 09:58:38 i tried he wouldnt budge
general 2022-12-16 09:58:47 but i think he showed box
general 2022-12-16 09:58:56 but box was like a dumbass so he gave up
general 2022-12-16 09:59:12 but he knows how to do it i think
general 2022-12-16 09:59:24 its like the spinny rocket motor thing
general 2022-12-16 09:59:32 kinda overpowered but not really
general 2022-12-16 09:59:56 
general 2022-12-16 10:00:10 TRUE
general 2022-12-16 10:00:22 too bad it takes like 8 seconds to figure that out
general 2022-12-16 10:00:46 they are kinda buggy
general 2022-12-16 10:00:55 and they cant track moving targets
general 2022-12-16 10:01:04 its a hit or miss with that
general 2022-12-16 10:01:12 i tried it with
general 2022-12-16 10:01:14 springs
general 2022-12-16 10:01:18 and magnets
general 2022-12-16 10:01:27 but it takes a shit ton of space
general 2022-12-16 10:01:31 so i scrapped
general 2022-12-16 10:02:04 but what i do need is magnetlocking
general 2022-12-16 10:02:12 and how to properly do it

general 2022-12-17 13:32:30 <@447221768520859659> here is a tip
general 2022-12-17 13:32:36 you dont even need shaders
general 2022-12-17 13:32:52 just high FOV = professional looking builds
general 2022-12-17 13:32:57 thats the golden rule
general 2022-12-17 13:33:07 shaders
general 2022-12-17 13:33:09 ….

general 2022-12-17 13:34:48 <@670939038999511041> low FOV vs high FOV
general 2022-12-17 13:35:21 also <@447221768520859659> this is an example
general 2022-12-17 14:06:42

general 2022-12-17 14:41:01 then hull
general 2022-12-17 14:41:18 from t6-8
general 2022-12-17 14:41:25 i recommend the 75 qolop
general 2022-12-17 14:41:36 and the turret should be the fv4202

general 2022-12-25 12:58:30 doesnt ricochet
general 2022-12-25 12:58:41 so you have to aim for sides from the front
general 2022-12-25 12:58:43 or roof
general 2022-12-25 12:58:50 but its a very fun gun
general 2022-12-25 12:59:32 fv4202
general 2022-12-25 13:07:05 you should try
general 2022-12-25 13:07:09 bmp hull
general 2022-12-25 13:07:13 amx10 turret
general 2022-12-25 13:07:18 and tier 7 gun
general 2022-12-25 13:07:43 and
general 2022-12-25 13:12:47 <@200793484053970944> also you should try the 90mm M41
general 2022-12-25 13:12:58 it is an epic gun
general 2022-12-25 13:13:04 insane damage
general 2022-12-25 13:13:22 the heat is really good
general 2022-12-25 13:13:26 damage wise
general 2022-12-25 13:14:43 aphe is great
general 2022-12-25 13:14:51 heat is kinda worse but still good
general 2022-12-25 13:20:17 try
general 2022-12-25 13:20:20 bmp hull
general 2022-12-25 13:20:25 amx 10rc turret
general 2022-12-25 13:24:02

general 2022-12-25 14:06:50 
general 2022-12-25 14:15:09 
general 2022-12-25 14:23:22 depends
general 2022-12-25 14:23:49 when you are starting off its quite rough honestly
general 2022-12-25 14:24:01 but i think you need to focus on guns first
general 2022-12-25 14:24:17 armor doesnt matter that much at 9-10
general 2022-12-25 14:27:43 no
general 2022-12-25 14:27:46 get the L15
general 2022-12-25 14:28:02 L/44 isnt gonna be so
general 2022-12-25 14:28:06 good
general 2022-12-25 14:28:09 in the future
general 2022-12-25 14:29:15 
general 2022-12-25 14:30:37 no
general 2022-12-25 14:30:42 they are same same
general 2022-12-25 14:30:48 its just very slightly worse

general 2022-12-25 14:30:55 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-12-25 14:31:06 ive been playing before the alpha
general 2022-12-25 14:31:18 
general 2022-12-25 14:31:51 im telling you man
general 2022-12-25 14:31:55 get the -L15
general 2022-12-25 14:32:07 or the 125
general 2022-12-25 14:32:09 less pen
general 2022-12-25 14:32:13 but alot more damage
general 2022-12-25 14:35:02 <@200793484053970944> the L15 actually does more damage than the l44
general 2022-12-25 14:35:13 i just remembered
general 2022-12-25 14:37:21 barely
general 2022-12-25 14:37:32 
general 2022-12-25 14:37:32 look at this
general 2022-12-25 14:37:45 its 30mm less
general 2022-12-25 14:37:48 thats not alot
general 2022-12-25 14:38:06 and its 120 crates cheaper
general 2022-12-25 14:38:09 than the l44
general 2022-12-25 14:38:32 if you care about pen so much
general 2022-12-25 14:38:37 go get the gt-7
general 2022-12-25 14:40:14 it gets slightly nerfed
general 2022-12-25 14:40:24 its not bad
general 2022-12-25 14:40:33 but it wont be worth its price anymore
general 2022-12-25 14:40:43 same same stats as l15
general 2022-12-25 14:40:49 the only upside is the reload
general 2022-12-25 14:40:55 0.5
general 2022-12-25 14:41:38 yes

general 2023-02-24 04:21:49 with some good tanks in between
general 2023-02-24 04:22:14 they dont get alot of premiums
general 2023-02-24 04:22:28 most pf their tanks are overtiered
general 2023-02-24 04:23:15 like the M551
general 2023-02-24 04:23:28 or the jumbo 76
general 2023-02-24 04:23:43 or the M26
general 2023-02-24 04:23:53 the M60 RISE P
general 2023-02-24 04:25:40 still dont know how the sheridan is 8.0
general 2023-02-24 04:26:05 the bmp is at 7.3
general 2023-02-24 04:26:19 and it does pretty much the same thing with 5 less missiles
general 2023-02-24 04:26:25 and no stabilizer
general 2023-02-24 04:26:41 so the M551 is 8.0
general 2023-02-24 04:26:47 the bradley is also 8.0
general 2023-02-24 04:27:01 bradley good tank
general 2023-02-24 04:27:24 the T95E1
general 2023-02-24 04:27:37 7.3 levels of armor
general 2023-02-24 04:27:43 90mm darts
general 2023-02-24 04:27:48 doesnt do shit
general 2023-02-24 04:27:54 shotty mobility
general 2023-02-24 04:28:03 no stabilizer
general 2023-02-24 04:28:32 do you know what else is 8.0 and gets darts with a stabilizer and better armor and mobility
general 2023-02-24 04:28:37 the T55A
general 2023-02-24 04:28:53 the T55 is smaller
general 2023-02-24 04:28:58 has a stabilizer
general 2023-02-24 04:29:00 faster
general 2023-02-24 04:29:03 better armor
general 2023-02-24 04:29:19 the dart is better + you get more shell options
general 2023-02-24 04:29:32 and its the same br
general 2023-02-24 04:30:08 M551 should be 7.7
general 2023-02-24 04:30:13 so is the T95E1
general 2023-02-24 04:30:43 M103 is
general 2023-02-24 04:30:45 ehh
general 2023-02-24 04:30:53 its like a slightly better T34
general 2023-02-24 04:31:36 
general 2023-02-24 04:32:08 its a solid tank
general 2023-02-24 04:32:35 💀
general 2023-02-24 04:33:31 
general 2023-02-24 04:33:58 i liked the M60A1
general 2023-02-24 04:34:03 until i got the turms
general 2023-02-24 04:35:17 
general 2023-02-24 04:35:18 man
general 2023-02-24 04:35:55 8.0
general 2023-02-24 04:36:07 im considering going to 8.7
general 2023-02-24 04:36:14 but the rise p is
general 2023-02-24 04:36:16 💔
general 2023-02-24 04:36:29 M735 does not like to do damage
general 2023-02-24 04:36:40 it’s basically worse dm22
general 2023-02-24 04:37:10 yeah up until the abrams
general 2023-02-24 04:37:14 its not good
general 2023-02-24 04:37:38 i played the turms
general 2023-02-24 04:37:50 the US tanks literally could not do shit against me
general 2023-02-24 04:38:08 
general 2023-02-24 04:38:58 <@652925710976942100> even the abrams gets outclassed by the leo 2
general 2023-02-24 04:39:07 and its the same br
general 2023-02-24 04:39:32 
general 2023-02-24 04:40:19 the 2S38 could frontally murder an abrams
general 2023-02-24 04:40:32 the turms can lolpen it anywhere
general 2023-02-24 04:40:42 and those 2 are 0.3 br lower
general 2023-02-24 04:40:55 the XM1 is alright
general 2023-02-24 04:41:04 the AIM is just
general 2023-02-24 04:41:06 ok
general 2023-02-24 04:42:07 XM803
general 2023-02-24 04:42:11 im sad
general 2023-02-24 04:42:23 the bradley m3a3 tho
general 2023-02-24 04:42:26 thats a good tank
general 2023-02-24 04:42:48 though the bmp2m is like
general 2023-02-24 04:42:50 better
general 2023-02-24 04:43:06 but its still alright because of the TOW 2B
general 2023-02-24 04:43:19 thats its only saving grace
general 2023-02-24 04:44:02 so US is
general 2023-02-24 04:44:06 tedious
general 2023-02-24 04:44:30 thats why i decided to stop at 8.0
general 2023-02-24 04:44:40 and go to russia
general 2023-02-24 04:45:06 the US gets better after 10.0 but that grind towards it is
general 2023-02-24 04:45:08 not good
general 2023-02-24 04:45:35 
general 2023-02-24 04:46:03 poor XMs and MBTs when i shred them apart in 3 seconds
general 2023-02-24 04:49:31 mostly because the xm has 0 armor
general 2023-02-24 04:53:23 
general 2023-02-24 04:53:32 
general 2023-02-24 05:46:19

general 2023-04-30 13:08:48 this is the first time ive heard about this topic, but i can do my best to develop a quick theory

the amount of snowfall that a temperate forest (on a large area scale) determines how much water nearby rivers and lakes get provided with.
note that for rivers especially, it MUST be snowfall and not rain for this to reliably take effect as a river's water level can sustain high spring levels with the constant feeding of snowmelt from the upper watershed. The relation between this increase in water level and eutrophication is dilution. No matter if we had the most wicked snowfall or 0 snowfall, the water bodies roughly receive the same amount of nutrients from normal rain runoff that feeds the waters. Now when you have these summer runoffs in a lower level body of water,  there runs the risk of having too much nutrients (concentration of it) which can catalyze a fish-killing algae bloom. However, if there was a healthy, higher volume of water, there wouldn't be such a high concentration of nutrients and the water bodies would be safer for the year

general 2023-05-14 08:45:23 Yknow if you dig under the tracks and bury a body it'd take super long for them to find it cuz, 1 who'd look there+they'd have to stop the trains, 2 if a train crashes there it'd be assumed they were one of the passngers. Of course getting the body there in the first place would be difficult you'd have to find the train schedule and hope there aren't gonna be any trains during the night when you bury it. It might get found out by routine maintenance tests but I get the feeling the train companies stopped caring about safety a while back.

general 2023-05-30 05:22:05 didnt that thing got like a
general 2023-05-30 05:22:07 massive nerf
general 2023-05-30 05:22:40 like the dart
general 2023-05-30 05:22:46 got a 60mm reduction
general 2023-05-30 05:23:11 you cant even ufp a T64 at range anymore
general 2023-05-30 05:23:47 yeah
general 2023-05-30 05:23:54 but thats an 8.0 atgm
general 2023-05-30 05:24:22 even for 8.0 it isnt even that good
general 2023-05-30 05:24:28 the shileliga
general 2023-05-30 05:24:52 abrams is my main goal
general 2023-05-30 05:25:26 speed grind the M60A1 AOS
general 2023-05-30 05:25:36 its the only good tank in mid-high tier
general 2023-05-30 05:26:13 notable american tanks from 3.3 to 8.0 in my opinion are
general 2023-05-30 05:26:20 the M4A1 76
general 2023-05-30 05:26:24 the jumbo
general 2023-05-30 05:26:29 the pershing jumbo
general 2023-05-30 05:26:33 the T34
general 2023-05-30 05:26:41 the bradley
general 2023-05-30 05:27:01 the T26E5
general 2023-05-30 05:27:18 i think the M4A1 76 is better
general 2023-05-30 05:27:19 idk
general 2023-05-30 05:28:06 all the other tanks
general 2023-05-30 05:28:15 like the pershing, T32 or the M48
general 2023-05-30 05:28:18 are just
general 2023-05-30 05:28:23 painfully mediocre
general 2023-05-30 05:28:58 they are just
general 2023-05-30 05:29:08 tanks with no special merits
general 2023-05-30 05:29:16 really boring to play
general 2023-05-30 05:33:07 like take the M48 for example
general 2023-05-30 05:34:03 it's peers are the T54 1949 and the centurion
general 2023-05-30 05:34:22 the T54 has a better aphe compared to M82
general 2023-05-30 05:35:00 has a dart shell that is heaps more reliable than the 90mm HEAT
general 2023-05-30 05:35:12 and has armor that you could actually rely on
general 2023-05-30 05:35:31 the centurion has a decent apds gun
general 2023-05-30 05:35:37 and a full stabilizer
general 2023-05-30 05:36:06 if you want to play the M48 but better in every way in the same br, italy has a M47 with a 105
general 2023-05-30 05:36:28 at 7.3 while the american M47/48 is stuck with a 90mm

general 2023-06-02 05:18:14 I had a nightmare where I was on set with Dwayne the rock Johnson. We were filming a horror movie that takes place underwater. Between shots, I elaborately convinced the rocks wife to cheat with the whole staff except myself at the same time. The Rock finds out and starts chasing me through a multi storied building. He eventually catches me after I turn a corner and chokes me out in the air with one hand. I poke out his eye and it grows back, and he says IM THE ROCK and throws me. I run to the elevator and it closes just in time. As im escaping to freedom, the elevator stops. When the door opens, it's the rock. My view is just filled with his chest and then it dissolves into one scene, and I wake up

general 2023-06-29 03:00:03 for a big ship

general 2023-07-10 11:22:19 The prison-industrial complex is a system situated at the intersection of government and private interests. It uses prisons as a solution to social, political, and economic problems. It includes human-rights violations, the death penalty, slave labor, policing, courts, the media, political prisoners, and the elimination of dissent.
