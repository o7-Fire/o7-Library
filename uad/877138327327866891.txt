help 2022-01-05 23:13:51 Build this Sopwith camel today but it doesn't work I tried everything I could think of. I thought it was because of the tail being to long and to heavy and rest of the plane is not powerful enough to lift the tail up but it's so hard for me to figure it out that I'm looking for help here.

bug-reports 2022-07-11 19:28:08 Don't know if it's my WiFi or game
bug-reports 2022-07-11 19:28:35 Basically the propeller 2 doesn't have like  a cylinder around it
bug-reports 2022-07-12 12:59:32 Ok now I know
help 2022-07-28 20:03:47 Which desert camo is better? 
Also would love some suggestions :)
help 2022-07-28 20:54:56 You might need more control surfaces or engines to lift it off the ground
help 2022-07-29 10:17:11 What can I change in this F-16? 
I will decal, arm it with weapons and do more detailing later. 

Would appreciate a ping if someone responds :)
help 2022-07-29 10:19:32 Forgor to add these 💀💀

help 2022-08-04 18:37:00 Currently building a spitfire but I can't figure out how to hide the part of the propeller into the pyramid wedge
help 2022-08-04 18:52:22 You mean the propeller?
help 2022-08-04 18:58:05 How the hell do I place it?
help 2022-08-04 18:58:28 Like that it stays in place
help 2022-08-04 19:10:24 <@733552827342782474> how should I place the propeller?
help 2022-08-05 09:48:37 I think it Might be motor lock and other functions that need to load and work properly like motors, particles on  engines (Rocket engine, super rocket engine) etc. And much more available in game. 
After all depends on the device he's playing on cus mobile is hella laggy with big builds.
help 2022-08-05 11:53:39 I recommend adding helium blocks to the highest point on your ship if it doesn't work add more, if you run out of space on chimneys, bridge etc. find a spot that has similar height and add helium blocks there

(You might have your ship sinking from the front or the back so try to balance the placement of helium)
help 2022-08-05 11:55:39 Np

help 2022-08-05 17:23:14 It's for landing gear and cockpit
help 2022-08-05 17:24:04 If I knew how to make the cockpit with spring and in small space I would make it more realistic and better looking tbh
help 2022-08-05 17:24:37 I'll search something on google
help 2022-08-05 17:27:02 Compared to it I think it's pretty good
help 2022-08-05 17:30:34 You can change these ones to the main screen above

help 2022-08-06 09:46:18 What ship is this supposed to be on?
help 2022-08-06 09:47:21 If you are building something just like that without 3d model, a look at the ship it's hard to get the measurement right
help 2022-08-06 09:49:24 
help 2022-08-06 09:49:37 The intake is the entire nose wide
help 2022-08-06 09:50:00 Just build from this if you can

help 2022-08-06 09:53:13 The black thingy is the jet engine
help 2022-08-06 09:53:54 You can do the controls to zero or 9 something that you won't use if you don't want them to work
help 2022-08-06 09:54:21 Make this Unlauched
help 2022-08-06 09:54:28 Like before the launch
help 2022-08-06 09:54:54 Like you load it

help 2022-08-06 10:01:04 
help 2022-08-06 10:01:29 It should have some sort of a floor underneath it and be 1.5 blocks
help 2022-08-06 10:01:36 It doesn't really matter
help 2022-08-06 10:02:18 You just need something underneath so it doesn't fall
help 2022-08-06 10:02:43 You didn't delete this one motor lock?
help 2022-08-06 10:02:46 On the bottom
help 2022-08-06 10:04:15 Hmm

help 2022-08-06 10:05:54 Just use normal block I guess
help 2022-08-06 10:12:22 I recommend building it from 3d model
help 2022-08-06 10:12:51 It's easier and if you have problems with the build you can look up the real thing
help 2022-08-06 11:19:02 Is there a way I can convert this into a emoji?
help 2022-08-06 20:28:33 Does motor locking on command (like using explosive blocks on motor lock tower) to build a afterburner to my new jet will work in public PvP server?
help 2022-08-06 20:29:08 Cus I just saw a tutorial on the command locking and it said it works only in private servers
help 2022-08-06 20:30:23 Blast something I don't remember 0

help 2022-08-06 20:30:30 Ik that
help 2022-08-06 20:40:55 What's a German fighter jet that's using afterburner?
help 2022-08-06 20:41:09 Idk which one to build and make it accurate
help 2022-08-07 08:13:42 Priceless good job with it and I think you can add ladders on the nose or something for the extra detail and not make it look that empty
help 2022-08-07 09:27:14 I think YouTube will have
help 2022-08-07 09:27:42 If you're lost you can go there and learn helpful stuff you know

help 2022-08-08 11:34:26 Also it's polish (🥶🥶🥶) so I had to translate a bit
help 2022-08-08 17:22:21 It's polish WiFi that's why it's good
help 2022-08-08 21:13:22 Remove the x, make the dark gray frame on the edges more straight not that curly as it is now, make the launch pad higher and add some space inside so you can fit smoke pipes there and make the launch super realistic also the platform (light grey) should be wider on sides to make the "high thingy holding the rocket" a bit more chunky cus now it looks like a stick tbh. 
But expect the above everything else is good the colors are matched and the shape is well designed

P.s add one more "weird high thingy holding the rocket" On the left side to make it look better and stabilize the rocket a bit (for realism tbh)
