general 2021-04-26 17:15:25 hi
general 2021-04-26 17:15:54 does anyone mind telling me how to make a manual gearbox?
general 2021-04-26 17:16:42 <@!262001177422594048> hey, would you mind helping me create a manual gearbox? i tried myself but it kept jamming
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:19:54 hey
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:19:59 does anyone know how to make a gearbox?
general 2021-04-26 17:20:49 well, could you atleast tell me how you do it? if it doesn't jam often.
general 2021-04-26 17:21:46 did it work out?

general 2021-04-26 17:22:58 so like
general 2021-04-26 17:23:06 have you gotten any form of gearbox to work or nah?

general 2021-04-26 17:23:32 i saw like
general 2021-04-26 17:23:37 a transmission from a while ago

general 2021-04-26 17:24:33 how though?
general 2021-04-26 17:24:35 like

general 2021-04-26 17:25:12 so i'd need some help
general 2021-04-26 17:25:29 badguyd got  a transmission thing working though
general 2021-04-26 17:26:05 so like
general 2021-04-26 17:26:13 would i force one into another one by like
general 2021-04-26 17:26:21 the start of the motor,
general 2021-04-26 17:26:25 just around the start
general 2021-04-26 17:27:01 like hold on ill show you in dms if thats ok

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:31:43 wait
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:31:50 so how would a gearbox work?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:31:51 like
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:32:12 i saw in this uh
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:32:18 DIY video for some cardboard gearbox
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:32:26 it used gears and a guy use a little paper straw stick
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:32:29 to move the gears
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:32:33 to make it go to 1 to 2 and so on
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:35:29 meant to be
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:46 i believe so quq,
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:47 because
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:49 in studio
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:52 theres stuff like
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:36:55 customphysicalproperties
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:04 every material has their own physical properties
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:06 like ice
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:14 that has an extremely low friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:37:18 so you go for a slip n slide
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:32 quq
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:40 its known for ages
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:47 developers can make things float
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:48 or sink
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:38:51 even if its wood or ice
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:41:46 honestly
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:41:54 rick should make it so theres an option on blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:42:00 that it doesn't glue to other parts that its touching
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:42:05 it'd be extremely useful
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:42:08 just certain sides though
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:14 pistons
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:17 they use pistons
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:22 i already found that out
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:25 you can see the picture
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:45:53 oh thats probably easy.... probably
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:23 i found out
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:24 already
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:27 i see the thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:34 it shows a little grey line
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:46:35 at the top
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:47:18 wait lockheed
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:47:21 whos the og builder?

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 20:03:20 using it for RWD which stands for rear wheel drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 20:03:24 will be a real problem for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 20:03:31 as i have no clue how to do it :(
general 2021-04-27 20:06:34 guys
general 2021-04-27 20:06:48 does anyone agree the game could use something to read the RPM of something?
general 2021-04-27 20:07:00 like the rotVelocity which is rotational velocity in simple words
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 20:32:05 oh thats what i mean haha

general 2022-06-10 13:48:12 My dumbarse has finally managed  to get a rank and nobody cares ;D
general 2022-06-10 21:26:21 Lads
general 2022-06-10 21:26:27 I think I found out a way to make a speedometer
general 2022-06-10 21:35:44 Tbh, exploiting in plane crazy to just change the lighting for you is perfectly fine to me
general 2022-06-10 21:35:48 If it isn't use reshade
general 2022-06-10 21:36:04 reshade will actually make your builds look prettier if you can actually manage to get good settings..
general 2022-06-10 21:37:23 You'll just have to use exploits.
general 2022-06-10 21:37:51 It's known for being shit too
general 2022-06-10 21:38:08 The specular and shadow settings are what you'd wanna change
general 2022-06-10 21:38:09 brightness to
general 2022-06-10 21:38:11 too
general 2022-06-10 21:39:07 Lmao...
general 2022-06-10 21:39:13 Wait until you see my race car that goes 45 mph
general 2022-06-10 21:39:24 quote the "race car" part
general 2022-06-10 21:42:25 It isn't dangerous, I've used it before
general 2022-06-10 21:42:28 It's false positives, it happens
general 2022-06-10 21:42:35 Just don't go download it off of youtube though
general 2022-06-10 21:42:39 that's where you actually get viruses
general 2022-06-10 21:49:57 To make their builds actually look nicer.
general 2022-06-10 21:49:58 That's all.
general 2022-06-10 21:51:18 Aye.
general 2022-06-11 20:26:46 hiya
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:13:08 That's deffos "something"
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:13:25 If it doesn't explode after it touches a piece of grass, it's better than my inventions
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:14:00 oh nice.
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:14:11 I actually have an inline 4 and a v8 but they're just for looks
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:14:26 My inline 4 has a planetary gear transmission
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:14:30 You got that? XD
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:14:57 Wdym compression simulation?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:15:37 oh right
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:15:45 Wanna see my I4 here, btw?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:16:54 Noice.
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:20:28 Oof.
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:20:35 Anyways, that's me put my creation up :D
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:20:38 I'm bloody proud as fuck of it
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 21:21:13 Planetary Gearboxes are good for this game... Regular Manuals are terrible because there isn't any gears..
general 2022-06-30 21:38:42 Lads
general 2022-06-30 21:38:51 Is it acceptable using exploits to see the RPM of your build?
general 2022-06-30 21:39:08 Because, I made a script if anyone wants to use it
general 2022-06-30 21:39:16 It basically gets the angular velocity of the selected part
general 2022-06-30 21:39:20 what
general 2022-06-30 21:39:27 ;(
general 2022-06-30 21:39:36 ;C
general 2022-06-30 21:39:58 that's not... that's not the thing I was doing mate
general 2022-06-30 21:40:05 It tells you the angular velocity
general 2022-06-30 21:40:12 Not changes, it tells you
general 2022-06-30 21:41:01 It is, but it's something rickje should've added in,
general 2022-06-30 21:41:12 a tachometer is what would be needed in plane crazy 2 honestly
general 2022-06-30 21:42:27 "guys, how do i verify that my build actually works!"
general 2022-06-30 21:42:44 If you've got a functional speedomter or tachometer, you show that to me
general 2022-06-30 21:43:28 bUt thEres nO tAchOmETer!!111!1
general 2022-06-30 21:44:15 It's a thing that gets the RPM of something
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 04:39:07 i have managed to make a 3 speed transmission (nearly)
general 2022-11-25 01:33:47 he
