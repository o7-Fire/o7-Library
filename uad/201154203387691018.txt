plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:40:10 they removed edge lines long ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:43:55 building rockets is so difficult
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:44:20 a huge rocket engine doesnt have near enough power for even a single shaft rocket
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:44:46 how
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:44:50 its a cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:23 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:27 how do yu even do that?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:32 let me guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:34 motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:36 fuck
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:45:51 i still dont know how the hell to do that
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:46:04 i dont know how
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:46:29 i guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:47:16 edge lines
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:53:34 imagine a world where you werent restricted by building borders and you didnt have to motor lock to make something look decent
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:53:42 plane crazy 2 electric boogaloo
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:53:58 nah
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:54:48 you wouldnt need folding
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:54:53 if theres no building borders
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:55:08 what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:55:32 then what about a feature to change the grid size
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:55:39 or being able to scale blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:56:41 then how about f3x but with plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:56:48 custom parts would still be a thing though
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:57:41 i dont know of any game with f3x that has plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:57:42 name one
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:58:14 hmm?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:59:40 astrocraft is alright, but all those others are just restriced to a certain type of vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 09:59:49 ill have to check out babft
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:12 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:16 thats not even fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:29 build a boat isnt truly sandbox
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:40 since you have to grind to get more blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:53 i dont recall it having planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:00:57 when did they add that?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:01:35 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:01:48 still, none of those compare to the level of creativity and physics within plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:03:18 a single person?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:03:23 no wonder theres never updates
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:03:42 wow the last update was 3 months ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:04:06 he should definitely hand development to someone else who can actually develop and maintain a game
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:04:21 because thats honestly embarassing
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:04:31 well keep handing it over
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:04:39 until someone can commit to the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:04:57 true
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:05:02 fuck it rewrite the entire game
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:05:33 plane crazy 2 when
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:06:23 this game limits my creativity
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:06:29 thats what makes me not want to play it
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:06:46 i honestly cant be bothered to motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:07:32 various other stuff other than motor locking too
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:08:57 if there were more precise blocks or there was the ability to change grid size we wouldnt have to motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:09:33 then so be it
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:00 it wouldnt be too much if rickje would be bothered to pay attention to the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:08 again
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:21 i think he should just rewrite the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:24 or someone else should
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:41 i know he doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:10:56 then he should give permission for someone to make a sequel
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:11:30 welp
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:11:36 maybe in the future we'll see the day
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:13:19 i wouldnt mind losing my stuff over having more possibilities for creations
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:13:37 and sadly there isnt any other game like this but more precise
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:14:05 lol that old one
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:15:39 oh my
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:19:45 it does?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:19:52 i thought they still had simple planes 1
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:20:36 oh ok

plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:27:21 i guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:27:26 but sandbox was better
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 10:28:48 yes

creations-chat 2021-01-19 18:42:33 but its not terrible
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 20:59:05 so my plane was working fine, but when i respawned it it started struggling to keep flying
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 20:59:18 like it flew straight perfectly now its like it doesnt have enough power
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:01:29 watch your language dyno before i cap you
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:06:13 what if you wanted to build, but roblox said connection error id=17
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:41:35 progress so far on my S-64 Skycrane
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:41:41 just gotta add rotors
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:41:58 thanks
creations-chat 2021-01-29 07:46:55 i swear people downvote anything that isnt a 1:1 recreation of a vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:48:17 why not?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 07:50:49 rip
creations-chat 2021-01-29 07:53:21 well people downvote original creations a lot ive noticed
creations-chat 2021-01-29 08:07:21 ive seen some good creations that are mass downvoted, but thats subjective so it doesnt really matter
creations-chat 2021-01-29 08:15:16 i think it looks pretty neat, its not something you see a lot which makes it cooler
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:43:38 alright, i put the rotors on... now just need to make it fly correctly
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:51:08 uh originally no but then i was like sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:51:15 why not
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:51:46 i cant have it attached to the heli?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:51:48 oh bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:51:50 :(((
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:52:18 i think i have an idea, i could make a cargo module that would have cargo inside of it <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 08:56:10 phat

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:06:24 tada
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:06:37 just had to add another rotor for stabilization
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:06:47 not about to spend hours fine tuning a single rotor design
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:07:33 thanks

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 09:49:39 thonk
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:10:26 i added a little cargo module
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:10:31 so i can put cargo in
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:03 it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:08 by rope
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:12:19 so you can lower it to the ground while hovering and load stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:13:20 no its just stuck to the ropes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:05 true
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:22 but wouldnt that disqualify it from the contest?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:14:58 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:15:06 i think it counts
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:15:18 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:16:55 oh no the module isnt the cargo, whats inside of it is the cargo
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:16:59 which will be detached
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:17:12 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:17:20 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:17:41 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:17:52 a little loophole i guess

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 10:22:57 f u t u r e
