help 2020-02-14 20:59:55 How?
help 2020-02-14 21:01:48 I think that the weight is not properly distributed across the plane
help 2020-02-14 21:02:27 No it's like too heavy on the back or the front
help 2020-02-14 21:02:50 the weight is too strong at the back
help 2020-02-14 21:03:03 Well use delta wings
help 2020-02-14 21:03:43 Yes but it won't fly if tou don't put wings
help 2020-02-14 21:04:03 Put more of them
help 2020-02-14 21:04:16 I had the same problem on a little alien fighter that i built
help 2020-02-14 21:04:44 I built more wings and distributed the weight and boom it worked fine
