help 2020-01-24 14:44:24 I swear to god I  saw someone with a plane something like this before the addition of the new prop engines and their engine was slowly spooling up yet it was prop blades attached to something that made the props start slowhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/670196657094131722/image1.png
general 2020-01-24 14:45:00 probably ate something or got bitten and possibly infected
general 2020-01-24 14:45:11 cat bikes can be pretty devistating
general 2020-01-24 14:45:23 not only because it goes down to the bone and rarely through the bone
general 2020-01-24 14:45:30 but the bacteria left behind
general 2020-01-24 14:46:02 probably not
general 2020-01-24 14:46:13 unless exo is lving in china or near an airport
general 2020-01-24 14:46:18 extremely unlikely.
