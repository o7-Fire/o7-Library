plane-crazy 2021-06-04 14:42:14 honestly idk if i should take it as a compliment or an insult when somebody comes over to your plot and starts calling your thing that you've been working on for the past 5 hours a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 14:43:23 a lot of people call my things tuts
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 14:43:43 i guess i might have a similar build style as some tut people but idk

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:02:56 i tend to stick with the ships in galaxy (on roblox) because galaxy was older and i played it more but also because its got more ships with more interesting shapes
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:34 and then there are the old models...
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:44 thats true
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:12 and most of the remodeled good looking ships in galaxy are battleships or dreads and i dont make folding build sbecause i hate building upsidedown
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:31 sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:08:20 i want to make a vtol spaceship

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:26:44 am good
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:26:47 thats an old plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:30:29 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:30:30 grow wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:32:19 evolution
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:32:26 stop being dinosaur
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:32:28 become bird
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:32:47 it needs to evolve
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:32:50 like the dinosaurs did
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:33:11 you need to evolve like the guy that is sleeping in my helicopter door
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:33:27 why are there so many people in my blackhawk
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:33:36 its making my evolved dinosaur look bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:35:21 you grow wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:35:25 and wait a million years
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:35:30 to grow working wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:35:42 i have made your brain evolve
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:35:58 lol idk i havent evolved into mech bird
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:36:40 because i want you to evolve instead of me evolving to help you evolve
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:42:14 have you evolved yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:42:38 rip
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:42:43 idk i havent evolved either
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:43:54 yup
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:53:42 i told you to grow wings by evolving
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:53:47 that was the first thing i said lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:57:39 you didnt evolve correctly
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:57:46 the species that didnt evolve correctly died out
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:57:48 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 10:58:32 when do we get half wedge (up and down) 1x8
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:09:39 bruh i forgot how to fix this
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:10:02 i evolved wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:10:58 i need to evolve right someone please tell me how to do that again
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:12:02 im confused again
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:13:22 why isnt the triangle wedgeblock not a triangle
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:13:32 i need a real triangle wedgeblock
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:29:23 wait yeah why did you say that if you knew
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:29:27 that just makes you look stupid
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:31:16 he hasnt evolved smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:31:45 alright idk why i keep saying stuff about evolution today
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:33:08 must grow wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:33:38 <@!536152875563483146> didnt evolve with wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:36:11 become bird
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:36:15 stop being dinosaur smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:37:26 dinesor
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:42:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:44:49 how make blackhawk tail
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:45:37 epic tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:45:42 you should make more
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:45:55 my blackhawk tail is now more epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:47:00 
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:48:37 i suck at motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:48:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:52:15 blackhawk tail bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 11:52:18 im gonna quit
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:02:06 spine? i dont see a spine
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:02:13 wait nvm im stupid
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:07:52 yeah maybe like 5 more degrees
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:07:58 actually nah
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:08:10 yea take another pic from a different angle
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:18:08 the corsair was known to have a large propellor, larger than most fighters in the sky at the time
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:18:15 your prop is a bit small
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:18:28 it was also supposed to have tall frontal landing gear to keep said propellor off the floor
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:18:37 damn nice coloration
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:23:27 ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:26:05 mich better yes thats good
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:26:34 you take a couple hundred super rocket engines and slap them randomly on a plane the less that actually connect the better
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:27:44 some guy in my server thinks that he has admin
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:28:04 and another guy keeps asking him to prove it by making him fly
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:28:37 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:40:28 minecraft with shaders maximum
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:40:53 oh damn
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 12:42:33 propellor time lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:44:34 propellors sound like chainsaws
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:44:40 or a razor
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:47:21 bruh im out of room for propellors
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:47:43 and i didnt motorlock because im too pro for motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:48:14 heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:48:16 with fake props
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:49:16 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:49:46 they do
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:49:52 they just dont have lift
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:50:41 cuz real rotors are glitchy for some reason rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:57:36 do half pistons work on hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:58:20 i cant have the motors weld to the block underneath
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:00:01 yes half pistons work
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:02:37 look at its tail
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:03:57 yeah that too
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:15:50 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:15:54 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:16:13 epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:19:00 i hate the tail prop on heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 14:28:07 sus
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:47:44 wdym 'odd numbered'
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:51:35 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:51:47 oh wait i though yak 38 was a mig for a second
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:51:52 sorry
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:56:28 damn
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:56:34 whats that look like unmotorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:58:13 o
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:59:15 o the dorito
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:59:17 i liked that one
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:59:19 a lot
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 22:59:24 nice job on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 23:00:24 your welcome it was a really great build
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 23:04:42 why are non coax heli so hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 23:04:51 tandem rotors are much easier
creations-chat 2021-06-07 23:48:52 motorlock lol
creations-chat 2021-06-07 23:59:51 you dont make custom landing gear?
creations-chat 2021-06-08 00:09:31 i see i would call the back landing gear there 'custom' cuz it uses motors to move them but the front one.... I know you said you dont like thick ones but yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 00:15:26 bruh non coax heli are just....
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 00:47:47 real
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 01:04:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 12:58:08 so half pistons dont work for hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 12:58:16 no wonder my heli wouldnt go up
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:02:08 fake rotor
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:02:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:19:55 ive been working on this blackhawk for now like 3 days
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:27:15 for some reason this ballast will never get the right number it always goes down 0.01
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:28:41 my stupid heli just doesnt want to stabilize itself
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 13:31:42 giving up gonna go make a tailless heli instead
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 09:46:02 many wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 09:46:41 also if you want something that flies use hidden super rocket engines for speed or hover drive. helium to decrease weight can also help you
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:01:13 should i post on creations
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:02:28 nah it just takes practice
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:02:33 lots of practice...
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:02:48 better
creations-chat 2021-06-09 10:05:18 would i get banned or something if i post something in creations trying to get as much downvotes as possible
creations-chat 2021-06-09 10:08:56 alrighty then if i did then i would have sent the thing i sent in <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:34:21 
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:34:27 how even
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:37:10 half wedge down?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:37:17 motor?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:39:30 yes please give me a half wedge down and up 1x8
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:39:41 or delta 1x8
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:39:58 for the slight curves that you cant do with the blocks rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:20 *cough cough* heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:32 heli make planes look easy as hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:45:18 of all the plane ive made, countless, only 2 cant get off the ground. of all my heli (5) only one can get off the ground but thats tandem so thats cheating
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:46:07 i just really need 1x8 wedge, 1x8 half wedge (up and down) and also delta 1x8 (or seven because yes but i like eight more)
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:00 that would be annoying though
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:11 oh yeah i could use that
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:29 hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:28 both sides are supposed to be angled but if i did it would be too pointy so either i make one side flat or have short pointy wings or have stupidly wide wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:47 say that to my potato computer
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:57 yeah same
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:04 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:27 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:36 or if they are in the same area they are technically one block
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:46 so they have the hp of one block even if there are like 30 in one block
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:54:49 mtrlck
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:06 why is the side of the ka52 so flat
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:20 makes my build look boring but its just because the heli is just super flat
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:56:27 .
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:56:33 the stupid exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:56:39 lets pretend it isnt there
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:57:30 woOoAhhhH
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:58:01 iM jJuuSSt sO baaAAd muSt quiT pLenE craZzy
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:58:39 ugh i gotta redo that motorlock on the other side too
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:11:37 i bombed one with my slow a10
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:11:44 ive also outrun many with the same a10
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:12:28 the way i fly the a10 is not a normal way to fly because wings are weird and so is its weight so they arent able to predict my moves
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:13:33 epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:14:59 yeah you people are distracting me and the sudden appearance of rickje as well
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:15:15 i should be done with this fuselage by now but ive only placed 100 blocks this hour
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:48:21 why are you on an alt
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:48:40 i see
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:49:01 delete something
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:49:21 so do i but i suffer as well
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:49:30 well actually no ive still got things i could delete
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 11:50:31 omg this guy is playing the thing by jeff the 'we gotta get spongebob back' but bass boosted
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:19:45 nice engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:27:42 bruh did motorlocks stop working rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:30:42 cpr saves
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:35:16 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:43:45 i used all my effort in blackhawk my ka 52 is crap
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:07 ayo ~~i want some of that~~
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:25 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:28 i almost did that once
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:36 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:46 wow i love ttf2
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:44:52 so many hours of just being epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:45:44 robin...?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:45:48 you mean ronin...?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:46:08 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:46:20 but ronin is a word it wouldnt autocorrect it
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:47:20 i might want to make an aircrane
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:47:35 but it would be kinda useless especially in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:50:42 woah a10 warthog but helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 12:59:07 hate it when i spawn in a build and instantly a whole bunch of randoms come over and get into it
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:00:27 ugh why are motors being so broken rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:01:11 they have no torque for me
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:01:35 also you call this thing good?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:01:53 of course that camo is just a placeholder
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:02:34 i used some tuts for those rotors and they suck
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:02:55 idk why im not using my own working rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:11:02 bruh never done non coax how do you counter rotate it
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:13:44 ifkin a10 breaks the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:20:24 somehow my stupid heli doesnt like to roll but it does like to spin
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:23:33 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:23:44 anyone know how to fix it
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:31:06 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:43:56 why
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:44:07 also they can set off impact tnt lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:44:22 i do sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:44:30 blows me and the shredder sky high
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:46:01 ballast
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:51:33 anyone know how to motorlock well besides the small ones i do
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:52:02 only if you set it to make it heavier
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 13:59:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:00:28 more
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:00:35 and and a ladder in front of it for texture
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:01:40 like so
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:02:04 is that off center
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:02:10 or is it just a weird angle
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:03:15 engine turns on
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:03:42 ouch
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:03:59 if that happened the plane would probably never take off again, nor would he
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:35:39 WTF THE A10 GUN IS SO BIG
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:36:48 i literally own a vw beetle theyre not that small
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:36:53 that thing is huge
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:38:15 ik it was a flying gun but omg its much bigger then i thought
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 14:41:36 ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:25:55 thinking of making a buccaneer
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:27:10 there are so many people who would kill you for that
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:28:04 correct
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:03 another thing wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:06 weve gone over this before
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:27 i had some pvp spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:48 deleted most though because they were like my first builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:30:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:12 i want to make a buccaneer but have you seen their airbrakes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:20 or guns that dont float
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:29 epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:48 nah mine was weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:51 mine was a tilt rotor
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:32:01 my first working plane was a tilt rotor
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:33:47 very true
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:34:12 i was able to shape things well when i started but i couldnt get them off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:34:22 that was before i knew you could hide super rocket engines inside planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:34:48 so i always had hollow planes that wouldnt get up because my props or engines at the front wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:38:56 anyone know a color id for the yellowish color for the nose of a buccaneer
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:39:03 cant find anything close
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:39:48 yeah blackburn
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:40:06 .
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:40:09 and what is that
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:40:14 i have many desert colors
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:41:28 can you tell me one
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:42:24 never
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:42:33 oh that one
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:42:38 nah i need a more yellow one

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:31:57 epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:34:34 probably a glitch
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:34:46 also that motorlock right there if you didnt know doesnt work lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:34:57 and i am aware of it so dont yell at me
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:35:25 i fixed it lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:36:28 BRUH NVM
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:36:40 motor wont lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:37:43 ha stupid motor i beat you into fixing you
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:37:47 wait that sounds weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:37:54 no i mean i just fixed it thats all
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:39:50 im going insane
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:42:40 how to get out of this cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:42:50 there just isnt room for a piston or motor because the chair is bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:49:18 yes but no
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:49:56 also is there a block like a wedge but stuck together into a 1x1 but its like a /\ shape (without motorlock) besides cutter
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:50:36 or maybe like /-\ but the slash is at the top
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:51:39 oh maybe half circle
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:54:11 i might have to.. not use custom landing gear...
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:55:24 i havent made something without custom landing gear since i started making non crap planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:57:18 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:57:26 its just a video of landing gear being weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:57:30 wait i need that link
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:57:46 need link for converting
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:58:06 yes but i need the link to convert it to mp4
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:58:34 o
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:58:39 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:59:26 why wont it let me convert it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:59:56 ugh ig ill usesome online converter
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:00:57 it wont work
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:02:43 and the video file was corrupted
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:02:48 lets redo it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:02:55 my computer sucks at recording
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:03:10 always corrupts files basically deletes all of it but last second
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:05:15 alright bad wifi lets just not do this
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:05:37 its just non custom landing gear glitching out and spinning the parts of the plane atm around
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:11:22 it just doesnt like to record immediately
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:11:36 probably not a corruption but just a bandwidth problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:11:43 but saying corruption sounds better lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:25:34 i had a dream where there was a wedge 1x0.9
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:25:54 i could use a half block 1x0.9 rn though
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:28:27 this is gonna be my first motorlocked jet
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:28:31 just realized that
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:28:52 and by motorlocked i dont mean just motorlocking on a gun for my a10 i mean like everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:34:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:34:35 but i remembered you can just use half wedge up with the slant facing inwards
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:38:55 motorlocking...
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:39:03 isnt making sense nothing is welding
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:39:37 this should work
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:47:10 oh nice its an aircrane
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:47:19 can someone help me with this
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:49:40 
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:49:48 a motorlock behind those disconnectors and one for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:49:59 its that half wedge there that somehow welds it but idk how
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:53:03 
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:53:10 oh half triangle is a full block?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:53:21 for which
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:53:38 but i need it for wall
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:54:25 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:54:29 without
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:57:27 ah but now it locks too far
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:58:19 that would put it back to what it was before
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:58:45 plus also now exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 12:10:25 alright its kinda ugly but i did it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 12:14:21 
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 12:14:30 its not pretty but it works

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:22:40 i cant find where
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:22:52 (also im using glass to see them not motorlock lol)
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:24:24 i dont see any wrong welds
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:24:51 spent an hour and a half just trying to unweld but i dont see any
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:34:10 unwelded it
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:34:27 by remaking it exactly the same idk must have been a glitch
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:36:23 wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:36:38 i used untoggled trails instead of cameras the cameras were weldingim so dumb lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:40:30 but wait its easy
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:41:01 also has anyone else had super glitchy trails (the 'block' not the effect)

bug-reports 2021-06-12 11:17:51 ah
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:18:59 i think i understand
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:20:32 ok but how do i put this on a wing
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:20:57 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:21:50 im confused
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:22:20 im sorry
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:22:35 its my first motorlocked jet
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:23:14 
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:24:56 
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:30:18 for parts that faze into each other
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:38:28 im imagining
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:38:41 especially how much i dont want to do this weird wing thing people are telling me i need to do
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:44:17 i do but i dont
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:44:26 mostly because i dont really know how
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:44:54 i dont understand how to put a wing on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:50:06 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:56:18 mine doesnt do that when i motorlock it instead the stuff i turned downward went back up instead of fazing
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:56:24 but the motor has max torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:56:42 do i need to use a normal motor with lock on?
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:57:36 probably
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:58:01 still doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:59:19 
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:02:06 it does
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:07:12 would show a video of it not working but my computer doesnt like converting them to mp4
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:07:31 you need an mp4 video or else it wont send
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:07:46 then it will probably work
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:08:09 drag and drop probably
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:10:08 
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:10:17 see it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:10:24 thats a motor with lock and max torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:12:49 yeah it is all those
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:16:13 nice video
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:27:58 i just realized i dont have any space to put all these angled motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:28:08 theres already motorlocks where they need to be
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:29:42 im getting ads in spanish
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:32:02 oh yeah i figured that out a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:32:26 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:42:19 probably
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:42:27 also delayed motorlocks are actually pretty fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:45:36 this is gonna be my first delayed motorlock also for angled wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:46:03 is there a way to angle it more
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:46 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:10:30 yeah thats trails
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:11:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:12:03 damn when i opened that video i accidentally looks at my recs and there was some creepypasta stuff and it was like one of the only ones that are actually freaky
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:12:24 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:12:35 these angled wings are annoying
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:14:01 ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:15:08 oh nice morgan
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:16:48 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:29:37 i just remembered.
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:29:42 that the wings on this thing need to fold
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:31:12 oh no
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:31:15 his pink jet
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:31:31 wait you two were the ones dancing in the sky a week or two ago right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:32:01 dancing; verb, two jets fighting each other but cant get on the others tail so they just fly in circles
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:33:56 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:36:58 oh you colored in the bottom?
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:37:09 finally it looked so bad with it all the same

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:43:34 no room
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:43:44 also stupid motorlock pulled the angled wing backwards
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:43:52 now its too far
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:45:03 literally going to not use angled wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:45:09 only spent 4 hours trying to use them
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:47:44 run
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:50:24 lol

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 07:40:09 when you are trying to get the viper attack helicopter and this pops up under top hits
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 07:40:30 dont even see a v in the second one
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 07:40:39 but also why
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 07:40:56 why would people look that up so much it becomes a top hit
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 07:43:29 i never use safari is 'top hits' a recently searched thing? and if so, who looked that up
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:35:07 tut jet next to you
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:39:36 because it was broken
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:39:49 or hard to manage idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:40:01 and the one in roblox is just super unreliable
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:41:25 anyone know how to make nose art
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:41:41 actually ill figure that out later
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:44:50 a better question; how do you motorlock a build into a ball
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:46:32 i mean it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:46:49 its got tut air to air missiles too
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:47:03 never
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:48:58 m but i need a full one
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:49:36 nvm i did it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:49:42 you just surround the ball with cameras
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:50:47 yeah...
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:51:06 had this problem when i tried making a cobra
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:51:09 reason i stopped
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:51:29 even harder when you are going off a single image of a sketch
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:51:33 but i want to make this thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 09:02:34 how is your name...?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 10:18:43 exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 10:18:50 never noticed it before
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 10:40:17 no?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 11:26:45 mig 21bis just a stick with a dorito stuck to the center of it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:02:55 war thunder time lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:40:14 wait does the steel one (i think its diamond steel) have more hp then other blocks or was it some guy telling lies in a server
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:48:33 nice ass
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:49:29 omg
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 12:49:31 that is die

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:12 duh
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:23 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:53:33 but he did ask
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:54:55 yoooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:02:13 is the summer update out yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:02:41 been waiting like a year or two to make this catalina
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:06:12 or is there a way to make planes float realistically without pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:06:20 all my attempts sink
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:08:27 omg this guy
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:08:59 he keeps calling my buccaneer a bird and keeps saying to make the front more beaklike for bird looks
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:09:18 and he goes 'what is it' i say the british buccaneer jet and he goes no its a falcon
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:10:39 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:10:47 for like 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:12:26 heres an example
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:13:16 yeah now he is
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:13:23 but before it seemed like he wasnt
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:18:02 <@!581412939223924767> i want to fight your pvp spaceships so bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:20:50 same lol

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:22:40 oh ok
bot-central 2021-06-18 09:22:51 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 09:23:27 ye shredder orb was in the pvp server i was in
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:26:27 bruh how to apache nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 10:27:01 idc im gonna go do something else besides plane crazy for a bit
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 12:22:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 11:23:28 wow deadchat
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 11:46:49 haha making a tinfoil huey
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 11:54:12 huey?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 11:55:13 wait same thing lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:01:32 gonna make this because funny
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:24:59 i saw that
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:30:08 do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:30:11 its fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:30:25 idk but somehow making things in tinfoil is just
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:30:30 feels good
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:31:04 plus also funny and an excuse to make the nose sloppy because how tf do you make a huey nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 12:34:57 why have i never thought of tinfoil things before lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:20:54 lol someone might go trhough this chat and ban you
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:21:04 cuz lag machines are a reason for being banned lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:22:05 im dying
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:27:49 this is true
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:28:39 honestly it isnt enforced but whenever somebody starts up a lag machine i always threaten them with that 90% of the time it works and they dont blow it up
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:33:15 yeah that happens with my buccaneer sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:33:26 impact bombs are just so irritating sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:41:50 yeah its in keyboard shortcuts i think
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:03 alright ive been making this thing too simple now
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:13 might just not do it because yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:33 ik what that is
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:38 ive had it off for years
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:42 i meant the heli im building
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:42:56 tinfoil huey because yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:28 why would you
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:37 mine are always at speed 5
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:43 unless its like battleship cannons
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:52 but i dont make ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:44:09 i do because realism
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:44:21 but 1 is just disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:45:40 big big battleship guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:46:15 when simple is too simple
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:46:27 yeah ive been doing this for the past 2 hours
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:46:50 on air to air missile ailerons
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:16 tried making it simple and flat like the tinfoil one but eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:28 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:34 mine are realistic
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:39 also 5 is pretty fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:48:46 wont put a10 cannon on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:49:00 im not making stupid tinfoil huey anymore
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:49:26 anyways i already have an A10
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:49:57 was before i became one with motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:50:30 nnnoooo...?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:50:41 it was a ground target assault vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:51:25 and also much slower than other jets at the time so not liked very much until some random squadron went and destroyed some things well in the A10s
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:54:45 yeah one of my older builds its slow got custom landing gear has weird weight that always throws off shredder orbs (i think its at 13 shredder orbs outran in a row rn with close calls such as it literally being less than 5 studs away) etc
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:54:54 also i hate its engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:55:09 for hoverdrive? i had that problem in my blackhawk and half pistons didnt work
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:55:57 ??
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:23 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:57:02 🙃
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:07:14 um i may need help motorlocking more props into my blackhawk
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:09:47 dont know how to motorlock like 5 in lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:11:14 50*
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:17:06 im trying to motorlock about 50 propellors into my blackhawk so that it gets off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:17:20 its not a weight issue just a lift issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:17:33 cuz im using fake props because coax heli are the worst
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:21:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:22:05 i want to motorlock normal propellors from the build menu under the main rotor so that it can work but not spin due to the drag from a normal rotor, which is why im using a fake rotor
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:08 yes but i need the stability from whichimicallit
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:12 wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:17 i am
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:31 what im trying to say is i need something to lift my heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:25:52 which means i need to motorlock things into my heli
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:06 wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:12 they are fake rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:26:17 omg.
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:28:09 im not great at motorlocking things like towers
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:28:10 it doesnt really work this is just stuff i remembered seeing somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:28:40 and idk where props go (ill use lots of mini propellors to lift said helicopter)
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:30:42 oh heck i made one that works
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 14:30:50 just did random
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:05:58 when your helicopter doesnt want to stabilize itself
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:06:25 ngl it would be easier to restart instead of fixing an old build
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:06:31 idk why im doing this
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:07:16 i want to to some trolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:08:34 so instead ill give my chinook tiltrotors like its supposed to have
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:00 dont make it time for me to *cutely bombs shredder orb*
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:08 also why do people use bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:17 theyre just worse shredder swarms
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:32 and orbs are definitely superior
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:54 eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:09:59 still think swarms are better
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:10:10 i remember the earliest swarms
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:10:15 oh boy those were fun to mess with
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:10:46 you
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:10:48 shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:11:04 your fate has been decided
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:11:10 be ready to face your judgement
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:11:57 nice hunting
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:21:31 this is true
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:21:39 why
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:21:47 i only use other ones for either noise or effects
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:22:02 or just because super rocket spam is easy
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:23:25 or make the old pvp cars that are still op
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:23:39 like my nissan all terrain frontier advanced
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:23:51 my friend named it lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:24:39 hate that you cant send .mov
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:24:57 cuz my computer doesnt like converting them
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:26:44 oh wow tha tis
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:28:12 alright gn people
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:04:23 the 5th dimension (ignore watermarks i just quickly converted and compressed shh)
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:04:42 was trying to give it tiltrotors like the rl counterpart
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:04:58 space-ook
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:09:36 ugh i hate improving old builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:09:48 harder than redoing them
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:32:59 alright
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:33:16 how does a chinook have tiltrotors but the rotors dont hit when tilted
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:35:07 mmm motors like breaking
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:35:40 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:35:55 you dont even do anything and they glitch you out of the world
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:36:06 all i want to do is give my chinook proper tilt rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:37:34 wtf now my motors are locking but they arent motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:38:05 i dont have them motorlockedlocked
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:38:19 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:38:37 i have them powerlocked but that isnt supposed to motorlock them
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:39:04 i have lots of powerlocked creations it never does that lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:39:24 where powered is also on
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:39:37 it makes it so that the motor doesnt move when it isnt in use
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:40:00 lol ive never had it do that
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:40:11 just a bit confused
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:40:12 is all
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:40:19 oh yeah they do unlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:46:25 thats it i give up
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:46:29 motors are so broken
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:50:17 instead of tiltrotors ig i need some hidden thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:51:55 the lift is the rotors duh but where should i motorlock some hidden thrusters in (im doing some thing where i improve old builds)
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:56:28 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 05:59:36 didnt think there could be a chinook much worse than mine which looks simple but this one makes me want to puke
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 06:13:54 um i got a glitch there are 2 of everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 06:14:26 i saw something like this in bug reports once
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 06:14:27 epic
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:03:18 wait ive never seen that build before
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:17:18 never seen those ones either
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:17:33 the only tut jets i really see are mad vulpen besides that they are all custom
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:30:24 not farded
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:30:30 but nice ar234 been meaning to make one for a while
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:40:36 im so bad at camo
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:41:06 instead of desert camo mine looks like someone took a fat dump on my chinook
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:00 nah i decided to use the simpler one
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:43:46 took away most of the bad camo but still an eyesore
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:44:25 i i did
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:44:30 at some point
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:44:33 made it look even worse
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:50:26 lol theres this shredder flying snake its fun to fight
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:51:38 is this what shredders have become
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:51:44 oh mine also has lava spitters lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:03:13 is there a way to change rope length
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:03:54 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:04:02 restitution?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:04:08 speed?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:04:11 thickness?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:04:34 but which setting lengthens it
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:05:05 oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:05:46 <@!559568621312147476> wtf is this
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:05:55 oh thank you
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:08:34 that bit is weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:08:35 fix it
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:10:52 suspension railway looks like a helicopter car
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:56:59 made my chinook carry a humvee which doesnt have moving wheels lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:58:59 just outran a shredder orb that speed upgrade really helped
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:07 first shredder i saw was a swarm. It was beautiful the way it swarmed around, i liked it even more when i made my car a vtol to escape it without knowing that i was still prey because it could fly
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:15 actually yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:30:05 wonder what the next shredder design would be...
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:30:16 honestly i never thought they would take to the skies so fast in like just a year
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:31:44 tf is that
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:31:57 lava spitter shredders?

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:33:41 oh shredder orbs
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:33:48 shredder orbs are weak
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:09 all you need is only even 1 impact tnt hidden in your build
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:12 boom
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:29 ha if theres anything i know its pvp defense
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:38 but they always do
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:48 shredder orb users are predictable
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:36:28 ive never met one who is smart
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:36:46 they all just shoot when they ram you
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:37:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:38:28 bsides most of my builds and/or flying style is just confusing for shredder orbs
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:38:53 i just outran like 3 shredder orbs in the last server with my barely working chinook
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:39:04 with the humvee still attached throwing off my balance

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:47:00 wdym hard to stabilize
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:47:04 its super easy
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:47:14 all my good planes are wasd

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:30:47 i want to make another tandem rotor helicopter but i cant find any besides the chinook, its twin and its ugly sibling
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:53:35 overpriced osprey
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:53:53 normal osprey are much cooler
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:54:26 mmm i should make an osprey
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:54:41 it will be my 3rd try hopefully my superior skills will get it off the ground again
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:54:43 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:55:22 hate that thing'
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:56:54 when osprey has retractable landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 10:56:59 suffer
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:04:09 idk without looks modern with looks futuristic
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:09:40 how osprey windshield
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:12:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:21:07 decided to delete it because even if im reporting someone (in the wrong channel i think) for him building the old german ww2 symbol i might get warned because yeah

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:30:24 noses are always the hardest part
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 11:43:46 yknow its honestly my favorite when you start making something then someone tells you it looks almost identical to a tut
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 12:05:54 anyone know how to make those flaps that cover landing gear when they are pulled up
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 12:17:52 how about redesigning the 'gun' so that it doesnt have empty space in front of it
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 12:18:07 it looks bad and also makes turrets glitch in walls
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 12:18:13 those are some of my suggestions lol

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:05:17 ive seen some
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:08:51 tf
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:23:20 how about a half motor
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:23:51 or 1x8 (or 7 but 8 is better) wedges, triangle wedges, half 1x8, and 1x8 delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:23:55 because custom angles are hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:57:41 i just saw the most beautiful king stallion
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:48:10 this guy is pissed because im making an osprey and wont attach a couple jet engines on to the wings to fly with him
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:48:14 it doesnt even have flaps yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:48:45 idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:49:30 a lot of the time i take extreme damage and am still stable when using the chinook, including not having a middle. the only way to really take it out is  cut it in half or take out a prop
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:51:32 nah
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:51:46 just the center part of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:52:17 if i have the cockpit and the back prop still connected, even by one block, i can fight another day
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:52:32 i dont even need props because i have motorlocked engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 10:33:58 maybe give it the metal material
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 10:34:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 10:43:11 flying fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 10:52:43 someone should make BT-7274
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:07:15 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:07:26 yeah him
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:07:45 mm i have way too many hours in ttf2
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:08:52 i think in plane crazy you need internal reverse engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:09:13 are motorlocks broken for anyone else
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:09:25 mine keep glitching out of existence
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:09:40 as if they arent anchored to the build
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:11:14 just gonna rejoin see if it fixes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:12:42 idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:13:08 or any of the titans i would but i cant make mechs anymore
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:13:17 plus also they are extremely detailed
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:13:27 and i am not the best motorlocker
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:19:46 nevermind motorlocks are just broken
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:22:57 fisherman is hard work
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:24:02 wtf is going on
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:24:10 what does it do though
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:31:02 i think motor 2 are glitched again
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:31:08 where they dont have torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:34:14 my motors are flopping even though i have max torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:35:55 idk my rotors work on my chinook but on my osprey they have the exact same controls and they decide not to work
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:37:00 and i dont want to switch to powerlocked motors because those are glitchy
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 11:37:42 4

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:18:20 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:19:07 
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:19:11 remember it gets wider when i put the tread guard things
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:19:24 yeah just a bit too long
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:19:51 by like a 'wheel' but i cant take one away or it wont have enough for accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:22:02 here not as long
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:22:49

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:28:04 fireworks need longer range
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:28:41 they only shoot like an inch
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:28:52 someone put that in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:28:56 idk lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:30:43 MO
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:30:49 nice typing
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:31:01 yes but i mean when using tonk
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:33:18 actually i accidentally made it do that then slowed it down for realism
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:35:59 i just saw a jet the size of an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:04 lol i tore the jets engine off and it plummeted
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:09 tonk is supreme
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:37:31 its engines are larger than my abrams and my abrams is the size of my plot
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:38:03 what kinda station
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:38:04 it sounds fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:44:55 thats cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:44:59 do you have it saved
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:45:16 it would be fun to join your server in pvp and mess around
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:52:16 plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:52:31 i just saw a fighter twice the size in my old server
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:54:04 ok thats me exaggerating but it was a bit bigger
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:56:27 i left that server lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:56:36 i only got 2 looks at it
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:56:50 once as it dive bombed me and once as it was spawning and i shredded it with my turret
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:57:04 but it was longer and wider than that one
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:57:18 the one you showed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:58:01 this other one was pretty big
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:00:23 lmao i just went 200 times the speed of light

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 00:59:09 all rocket engines actually have mini pilots inside lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 01:27:41 mm its hard to make a plane that vulpen made because all other ways look bad but if i do it the good way people will say its vulpens tut
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 01:33:00 the mad vulpen
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 01:33:09 he makes tuts

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:12:00 idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:12:28 i dont get how tnt armor works i thought it was resistant to cutters but at the same time i fought an all tnt tank and i couldnt do damage period.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:12:37 not with guns or rockets
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:08:56 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:09:26 oh nice

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:11:38 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:12:20 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:29:53 sure why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:32:00 when you need to take your intakes off for your ejector seat
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:32:16 as well as some wall
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:33:16 
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:34:16 wdym you have barely any damage
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:34:22 i fall in lava all the time and survive
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:34:48 yo that one is so much better
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:35:00 you spelled infinite wrong lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:16:39 how do you make seamless flaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:20:39 i tried it didnt work lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:20:47 the flaps got stuck on the other wing
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:20:57 even though i motorlocked them in
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:23:09 it should be like this right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:24:15 o
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:24:25 but it still doesn't work lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:25:15 oh nvm just must have been lagging last time
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:47:34 money
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:49:36 building an F-5E
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:58:31 its basically an extra speed thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:01:03 less drag = more speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:06:20 yeah i remember when nothing i made could get off the floor
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:06:38 that was before i thought of hiding engines on the inside of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:08:40 lol idk how to do custom angles well
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:14:27 👏
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:21:36 yeah customs are much better
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:23:31 dont use a rudder
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:23:55 just ailerons and elevators
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:28:25 anyone know how to make an afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:30:16 i mean one of the good ones
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:31:40 ..
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:33:55 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 10:35:23 mig 19
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:02:30 the very bottom one
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:35:24 big wing
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:35:59 wow i spent like 4 hours on an F-5E and it looks like crap
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:36:07 i gave up on making it look good
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:36:14 so much for second motorlocked jet
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:37:41 the bigger the better
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:37:50 or motorlock lots of wing panels into small wing
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:38:01 i find more wingspace stabilizes it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:38:09 and it all motorlocked together works
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:49:38 then give it that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:10:41 when theres a guy in your server that has a rocket that goes 26k with only propellors
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:11:15 his thing is only like 20 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:11:32 it looked slow but holy hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:11:39 that thing was a bullet
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:11:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:12:01 its like a stack of props with a seat and a chair
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:12:07 only like 10 props
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:12:13 and trail holding it together
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:12:48 tried to take a pic but he shot off
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:12:56 got one
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:13:38 
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:13:50 dont copy it guys he worked hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:13:57 i think
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:14:17 oh they are?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:14:22 i only got a quick glance at first
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:14:24 same shape
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:17 meanwhile my new jet is bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:18 probably going to delete it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:31 what mine?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:38 its like 500
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:41 bad turning
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:47 very durable though
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:15:56 unless you hit the back and boom no wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:16:05 also ejector seat i liked that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:16:21 it can take a lot of hits unless you shoot a motor at the back
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:17:11 ok nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:17:29 so nevermind its not durable
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:17:40 this AA unit is really good at taking me down
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:20:00 ok i just got a motor broke by one of vulpens superfortress tuts and it tore my front off
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:20:08 definitely not good armor
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:30:10 ikr my other planes can survive a nuke but this one will be felled by the random flying bullet
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 12:42:52 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 13:13:40 trying to have a tea party on a carrier but a shredder orb decided to exist

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 10:10:29 i need new naval things
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 10:11:20 wish i knew how to make good ones
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 10:13:04 i think those are pontoons maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 10:13:13 idk i havent got a good look at them
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 10:13:57 did you know they are thinking of scrapping the USS Enterprise

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:57:05 ive got bored of jets again
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 11:57:14 must make WW2 dive bombers
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:02:25 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:24:07 you must evolve
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 13:03:53 👏
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:09:26 i just realized that there isnt a skyraider tutorial even though its super iconic. welp i guess its up to me to (not) make the first one
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:19:01 👏
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:22:05 nah mechs arent that common
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:22:16 trains are super rare yes mechs are kinda rare
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:35:40 actually many bombers (at least piston engine) were able to outrun fighters
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:38:37 mm noo mmm not at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:39:04 the most maneuverable are the orbs but they cant even touch my a10 which has bad everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:40:31 thats a shredder orb
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:40:57 shredder ball shredder orb same thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:41:01 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:48:07 if they did then shredders would actually be unstoppable for once

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:07 oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:35 ngl first motorlocked jets are always the best
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:51 ive made many since but only the first was good
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:24:12 i only share things i put actual effort into

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:44:30 my chinook is literally a magnet for these noobs
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:44:46 one of the reasons i added a humvee so you cant climb into it unless i let you

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:38:04 'how to stall'
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:42:59 real plane physics: will stall if you go straight up
plane crazy physics: wont lose speed if you go straight up
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:51:25 that was nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:51:36 ik
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:51:58 imagine

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:54:39 i wish
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:54:52 and aerodynamics would be cool too
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:55:39 what should i build
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:56:07 i almost did that earlier
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:56:09 so why not
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:56:38 idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:56:42 its ketchup and mustard
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:56:45 the red makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:57:02 me when shooting off into the distance and its red
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:57:38 i mean there are tracers irl that are red
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:57:44 and green tracers are popular too
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:57:51 but why two different colors
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:58:25 yeah i shoot off into the distance all th etime
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:58:45 so the space time continuum is a target?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:59:49 yes red is usually a tracer color
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:59:57 but the other bullets are not seen
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:00:06 so why are there both red and yellow
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:00:44 ik but the others wouldnt show up
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:00:49 its tracers and no tracers
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:01:26 irl theres a tracer every so often when shooting but they dont armor pierce so like 90% of the shots are actually practically invisible
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:02:08 YOU WOULDNT SEE THEM IF THEY WERENT TRACERS
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:02:48 same
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:04:03 alright im leaving this conversation cuz i need to build this thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:56:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:56:13 must
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:56:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 12:56:48 if it didnt then your spaceship would have a heart attack
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:49:36 never actually knew what 'ignore others' on a hover thruster does
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:49:38 what does it do
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:51:00 does it effect anything on a hoverdrive?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:52:29 m so pretty much only useful for using hover thrusters for its actual purpose
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 13:53:22 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 14:05:44 ifkin dies part 2
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 15:30:09 love that you have the half finished f22 around yours still
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:16:04 the
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:16:49 yeah *cough cough my f5e*
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:16:58 weakest motorlocked build
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:17:25 its an f5e
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:17:29 its jet sized
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:17:56 but its extremely weak especially because half of it is held together by one block because ejector seat
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:18:11 and the entire back half of the fuselage is pretty much made up of motorlock towers
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:19:02 same
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:19:50 nah mine is worse
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:19:53 weve done dogfights
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:01 you actually did damage after an hour
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:18 though at the same time by 'damage' i mean one wing panel is half hp
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:42 none of us won that really
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:53 no major damage to me or any damage to you
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:13 oh yes the crappy built F-5E
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:33 why
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:44 its already hard enough to kill you when you didnt have it
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:00 and that was ebfore you got warp fking like 900
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:12 and now you wanna go to warp 3453678
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:48 cant believe my buccaneer is still my best pvp jet
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:56 even though it was my first motorlock jet
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:23:32 what the hell
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:00 yeah the more symmetrical the better it works
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:26:20 omg i got the gremlin propellors again
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:27:09 *laughs in laugh*

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:37:26 wtf somehow two of my torpedos fell off
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:37:51 you can see one of the runaway torpedos on the 2nd funnel

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:50 it goes 650 and has no turning control
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:54 its perfect
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:51:25 it can steer in water but when its got no sense of gravity it doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:51:43 it does
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:53:09 ok but what should i build and im not touching my destroyer cuz im bored of it especially because it keeps crashing my game

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:55:40 its suspicious
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:55:58 mm blacklist them
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:56:13 anti copy doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:56:23 and if they come close and they are copying make the server turn against them
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:58:01 nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:58:07 not that i know of
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:58:15 if you could then copying would be much more common
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 12:14:34 thats breaking the number one rule of combat
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 12:14:42 war police be coming for you now
plane-crazy 2021-07-24 12:14:58 i havent been here in so long lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 10:39:51 why wouldnt you want elevation and depression
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:18:27 im thinking of building something russian but idk what (no tanks or ships)

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:19:37 good to see you, nice to know you still have good suggestions

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:19:44 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:19:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:19:52 i cant ever make that
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:19:58 not skilled enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:20:42 tu 22 is a tu 160 but tried to be a fighter jet lookiing thing lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:21:05 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:21:31 ive actually wanted to make one but my helis still dont like working, only one of 8 worked and i spent over 30 hours each
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:21:33 you made more?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:21:46 HAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:21:51 NEVER
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:23:14 high quality images of that: none
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:23:32 im going to eat a soviet child
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:23:38 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:23:53 damn...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:24:13 headfirst of course
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:24:57 whats the jet bomber with the turret at the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:25:01 i cant remember the name
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:25:05 its a soviet bomber
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:25:35 that tail would be a nice challenge
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:26:06 tu 14
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:26:10 or il 28
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:26:13 its one of the two
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:29:00 nice grammar
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:32:00 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:32:30 wish i had the one where a rocket hit a torpedo launcher on my destroyer and a torpedo flew away and tore it into threes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:32:56 that wouldve been a nice caught seconds before disaster
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:33:36 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:34:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:34:56 gonna try that now but i had to clip my buccaneers wings lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:35:24 ok apparently that breaks a motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:35:31 and now my fuselage just split into 5 parts
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:36:52 clipping its wings has made it possible to do a cobra
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:37:01 and make it look good
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:38:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:00 like a bird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:06 you just take your scalpel
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:12 and you just tear off the motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:22 and then your jobs done
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:30 but its tail on the other hand...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:44 its giant and tall and my plane can only go up without it but not down without it
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:39:58 so i cant do canyon run without more stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:40:02 modifications*
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:41:55 my plane is fireproof
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:42:10 it just tanked the lava
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:42:13 no damage just different colored bits
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:42:14 t r i a  l o n e
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:43:14 I DID IT
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:43:19 I DID THE CANYON RUN
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:43:28 then i accidentally tapped the lava trying to get out
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:43:37 turns out my plane has a one-time use fireproof
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:01 that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:06 time to retry
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:18 the canyon was larger than i thought so the tail works
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:23 i have it somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:35 you just need black star emoji thne color it red
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:45:28 bro the walls of this canyon
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:45:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:45:46 one hit off them and im taking a hot bath
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:45:49 very hot bath
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:46:21 i wonder if water jets make it so the burn effect doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:46:29 only if you add anything other than the star
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:46:31 including spaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:47:52 ill try it rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:48:06 but it will just be me dipping into the lava lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:48:17 i probably need some sort of machine custom made for this
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:48:48 but im too lazy im just adding a crane to my abrams
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:10 wait i need to be in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:12 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:22 im too lazy to server swap rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:36 nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:51:45 someone else do it but if it works credit me
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:52:06 k
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:52:24 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:53:23 gonna try my f5 instead because i can snip wingspace but its ailerons are smaller so i can keep them
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:53:56 first try a failure
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:54:00 i accidentally hit a ramp
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:54:05 and plopped into the lava
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:54:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:55:04 it reminds me of that time when everyone tried getting that tiny arch in that one battlefront map while boosting and coming from way above
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:55:37 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:55:47 my f5 is still a useless plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:55:58 my outdated buccaneer is still my best jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:56:17 if only my a10 had turning props...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:56:29 cuz that thing flies at low speeds like a butterfly
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:56:30 or
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:56:31 something
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:01:20 its crazy how much faster your plane is when its got no wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:01:32 so close to death
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:01:58 somehow my a10 cant takeoff anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:03:03 this is why i dont use old planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:03:09 but it might work for the canyon run
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:03:13 so im trying it
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:03:17 ive only made 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:06:42 and now i shall remember i landed a cockpit that flew perfectly after pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:07:09 still dunno how
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:07:19 damnit i got gremlin props again
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:07:31 i hate them
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:15 yeah the downfalls of motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:16 ok so somehow i went fully submerged in lava and didnt get charred (ignore how i butchered it i mean it flies)
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:31 its an old build
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:32 very old
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:36 before i motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:08:46 ae 10
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:09:57 im just that good
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:10:06 those ae 10 have the bad wings though
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:10:26 yup
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:11:12 lol i attached a wing connected to the tail above the fuselage so that my buccaneer is more stable with its wings clipped
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:11:17 hopefully i make it this time
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:11:24 cuz this works better than ae10
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:12:05 OK THIS IS BAD
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:12:10 IT HAS UPWARD LIFT NOW
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:12:14 I DIDNT KNOW LIFT WAS REALISTIC
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:13:36 I DDID CANYON RUN
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:13:47 I DID IT AND SURVIVED GOING UP
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:13:48 YES
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:13:50 FINALLY
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:15:52 lol when i did it i accidentally left my airbrakes open
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:16:05 even though they are entirely decorative
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:16:22 mine dont slow me down because i dont use wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:16:48 its just motorlocked stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:17:06 WHAT
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:17:07 NO
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:17:16 IT TOOK FIVE MINUTES FOR THAT IMAGE TO LOAD AND IT DELETED IT
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:17:22 and all my other messages
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:17:36 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:18:18 now i need to wait for it to load another 10 centuries
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:19:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:19:34 finally
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:19:39 thats what i used for canyon run
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:19:56 ignore the third wing i had for stabilization that SOMEHOW HAD UPLIFT
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:20:05 which is the reason im crispy
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:20:47 i feel very accomplished
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:20:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:21:05 ik
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:21:12 but its usually not that realistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:21:23 especially for a front heavy plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:21:54 now what should i build
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:22:03 i had something in mind but i did canyon run
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:00 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:07 its so small
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:37 why does yak 38 have such a pencil nose
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:56 same lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:24:03 i just mess around until thing goes up
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:24:28 im only able to make dual rotor helicopters like the chinook
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:24:32 because its stabilized
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:24:40 though coaxial would be easy too
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:24:47 its just the hover i worry about
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:25:51 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:31:19 if only i had good ping
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:34:03 finally
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:34:19 my gearbox on my heavy tank in war thunder
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:34:39 goes backwards when i want to turn my turret in the direction of the enemy who happens to be on my right
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:35:07 very fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:35:21 look up what degree the airbrake goes to
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:36:58 we need half triangle wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:39:04 what camo should i use on my yak 38
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:39:54 actually i just found one similar to that one
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:40:02 the one with the green underside looks very interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:40:39 but its blue like that one
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:43:16 ugh
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:43:22 i dont like the blackbird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:43:44 it makes my soviet jets nervous
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:43:58 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:44:07 weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:51:26 wdym this isnt the blackbird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:51:28 im pretty sure it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:51:32 the sr 71
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:07 its a funny looking spaceship ripoff
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:16 its basically always gonna be a blackbird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:23 so when its got a slight difference
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:29 i instantly think blackbird
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:52:57 mm
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:53:06 eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:53:13 still weird not spaceship yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:54:09 im gonna make the jet engines in this realistically tilted...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:56:19 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:56:32 smol wing
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:01:54 its hard unless you do the most common way which is just squares on the inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:05 for angles most people would use wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:12 oh really?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:02:24 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:05:52 how yak 38 canopy
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:06:14 i need like a wedge 2x1.5
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:06:22 whvat
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:06:40 i hate tilting...
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:06:54 oh i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:07:08 i mean that its not possible to make the canopy shape i need
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:07:37 i hate angle lock so much
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:07:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:08:18 yeah i need like this but all one angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:09:45 how would i hide the motors for that
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:10:15 .
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:11:24 me after a pvp fight
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:12:08 i dont want to do disconnector lock because it takes up a lot of space and i wont do tnt lock because i want normal pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:12:21 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:12:56 anyone know any other locks
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:15:28 genius
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:15:47 hopefully that actually works
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:17:13 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:20:08 yeah motor bugs are fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:20:17 ive had a 1x2 motor once with one of the bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:20:33 whatever
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:20:43 this one is probably a disconnector lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:20:50 with a motor

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:32:19 oh hello
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:32:50 time to mess around with angles which i hate
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:33:11 rip
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:33:15 why
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:38:43 yknow what
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:38:46 screw the custom angles
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:38:47 again
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:39:00 im going back to normal if not shaped slightly wrong canopy
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:20:40 well i finally remembered what i was gonna make when i started playing
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:20:46 its only been about 4 hours
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:24:01 i cant get ailerons to work on chunky wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:24:39 also i need a design for a compact 3 prop engine (sorry about demanding but does anyone know how)
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:25:02 is that supposed to be a stuart?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:25:20 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:25:32 its turret reminded me of an opentop stuart
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:25:43 dampen your suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:51:41 this guy is trying to run my abrams over but my suspensions are much better
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:52:04 he just got glitched out of this world
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:57:53 i kept getting tangled in his wheels he just did the funny fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:58:05 then got mad and got into a rocket and ran
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:58:44 how should i make the front catalina turret
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:59:01 i want it to be able to shoot but im ok if it doesnt move vertically
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:21:06 ok so i can vtol with my buccaneer
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:21:10 minus the t
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:21:14 just vol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:28:43 just vertical or landing
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:31:35 vol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 14:31:45 vertical landing
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:21:09 oh thats a fun game
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:21:51 democratic republic of congo and then form zaire and become democratic and just get a good economy works really well somehow
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:23:20 boom
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:26:40 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:26:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:37:16 i never see people put sparklers at the end of their guns and wonder why because it looks like its firing (duh) and also ejecting shells
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 09:37:25 and also if you do it change their control to click
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:02:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:41 wow nice ive always liked that plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:49 and im hoping that color is a placeholder
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:53:10 i wish i could do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:53:20 but i have a bad habit of painting while building
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:01:44 thing that flies and also was supposed to vtol with wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:13:13 idk why but im making a combine harvester
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:13:56 the early shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:13:59 remember those
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:16 the early shredders were just cars or tanks with a combine harvester header
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:34 sure
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:15:34 nice

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:13:07 i tried to tell this guy that custom wheels work better for tanks then the ingame wheels and he threw a giant fit
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:14:41 he blocked me lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 11:18:35 true

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 10:11:51 im a weeb but i dont s-s-s-stutter
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 10:12:21 hello right back at you witwrobloxalt1
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 10:13:02 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 10:52:53 these people are playing amogus
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:41:52 we need quarter blocks so bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:43:08 yes yes but i dont have room for more motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:43:44 its this problem that i always find myself in
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:44:42 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:44:48 im doing a mig 35
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:46:14 do a su 25
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:46:18 mixed with an a10
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:46:38 oh thats a nice model
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:48:37 ugh
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:49:23 i hate that motors are visible
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:49:44 and i cant put it anywhere else because of the motorlocks in the way
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:49:51 true
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:50:11 but this ones sexc
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 08:55:12 bommer
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 08:59:07 should i put custom gears on my mig 35 or just the lazy normal kind
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:00:49 i want a computer that can run more than 1 bar of graphics so i can see enemy planes that arent literally on top of me
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:02:32 does it have reverse engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:02:40 i think the sea vixen has reverse engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:02:56 i cant remember but i think it might
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:03:05 for stopping on shorter runways
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 09:03:37 lol
bot-central 2021-08-05 09:58:39 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 10:30:24 yeah i hated when it had like 12 slots
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 10:45:20 i finally got the angle locking to work in a way that it has a use
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 10:46:23 there seems to have been a slight miscalculation in your method
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:24:37 do fuel tanks blow up?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:26:28 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:26:38 ive wondered that for a long time but never tested it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:31:19 or if it set a fire effect when its shot at like when you get hit by a lava spitter barely that burns like 4 blocks and gets the other few charred
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:33:56 just a touch of realism
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:48:46 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:49:33 too bad the people who would have a chance of reading this are definitely not anyone who would actually be able to put this in a game
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:50:03 but they barely read out stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:50:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:51:51 he just speaks from the future
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:52:30 my mig 35 is already 1k blocks and i havent even started the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:54:13 i use discord slightly higher than everything else
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 21:54:20 but not weird corner like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 22:20:31 or any jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:19:03 well when i say jet i mean something as maneuverable as the ones people make in-game, it doesnt actually need to be a jet, but they are the bare minimum (as i said) maneuverability level to fight shredders well
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:22:13 why
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:25:34 custom angles
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:27:25 this would be fun to build
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:27:31 especially with the gyro cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:27:48 i already tried when he asked 'what new blocks would you like to see'
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:28:38 yeah that would be a hard one to do
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:28:48 i do too lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:28:54 but i got a lot better while working on my mig 35
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:29:00 which i stopped working on because im lazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:44:37 wish tehre were double motors...
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:04:54 w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:05:09 i close discord for a second
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:33:01 woah whats going on with motorlocks rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:35:45 wow im trying to make a star wars ship to replace my current pvp jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:35:46 and
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:35:51 the nose of the y wing is so annoying
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:35:57 (yes i know its a bomber but so is my pvp jet)
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:02:45 mmm making good looking double barreled turrets that only take up 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:03:10 im saying its a pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:03:31 even more of a pain when you need it centered and you are building on a 2 block wide thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:12:58 mm
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:13:05 i did that for canyon run
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:13:17 still surprised i completed it
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:21:23 my fletcher literally every single time one of its torps explode
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:21:32 it crashes my game but no one else even feels lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:24:26 thats why my fletcher is unusable
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:24:38 i only spent about 20 hours on it smh...
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:25:02 a ww2 american destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:25:44 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:37 lol the saber shredders are so bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:02 why is everyone here so scared of shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:11 i mean none are even faster then like 300
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:26 shredder balls are even easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:43 yeah at least its custom
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:54 and they get one shotted
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:11 honestly i wouldnt count this as a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:41 *laughs in jet bomber*
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:52 i will not imagine
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:36:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:36:28 oof
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:39:52 oh that would help alot
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:40:33 i only use hoverdrive because im lazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:47:24 what happened to the pink one
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:47:32 his op pink fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:47:53 i thought the pink one was a russian fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:48:21 <@!581412939223924767> remember when we tried to 1v1 but people kept harassing us in the private server
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:48:57 also you kept going a million miles an hour and i had lowest possible graphics because my wifi was really bad then
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:27 anyone know how to make funny landing gear of the y wing (i cant find any pics of the y wing landing gear that arent lego shut up)
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 08:39:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 08:39:52 less vibrant
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 08:51:38 what do physics do on an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 08:51:55 wow...
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:06:01 fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:06:24 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:06:26 fly first
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:06:35 while its skeletonized
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:07:55 you need to evolve
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:08:16 wow
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:08:19 now you can do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:08:25 unless you evolved into an amphibian
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:09:23 wow
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:09:34 congrats
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:09:39 you see
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:09:42 evolving does wonders
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 09:22:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:14 i almost built this
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:26 but why say the exact one from the mandolorian
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:35 almost built it today
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:41 instead im building the hammerhead corvette
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:46 WHAT
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:11:58 holy crap
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:12:13 20sps is only 1 meter a second
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:14:34 i mean its an arquitens light cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:14:43 say that instead of moff gideons whatever you said
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:15:26 yeah same
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:15:31 i prefer the raider personally
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:16:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:16:44 the imperial raider corvette
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:17:11 nah aquehoweveryouspellit is more like a mini isd
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:17:27 raiders are like isd and tie fighter combined into a weird light frigate
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:19:41 my hammerhead corvette so far is pretty ugly
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:20:05 hopefully it will get better
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:20:18 its got tnt in the head for ramming
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:22:04 thats better
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 10:32:08 in the tiny roblos or the larger roblos
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:57:57 wow
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:05:41 bote
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:31:38 i killed a many shredders by leading it into the props
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:31:49 its a very good strategy when you both have the same turning time
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:32:42 i am
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:32:58 ive never seen a shredder who was faster than my buccaneer
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:59 i have some pics of my buccaneer in creations
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:35:42 i dont have one
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:01 i must admit the early shredders were cool but then people just copied them or do the tuts
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:12 they went from genius to noob build
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:35 shredder swarm
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:39 not squadron
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:48 i remember my first shredder swarm that i saw
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:37:03 it was when shredder bugs were just arriving
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:37:10 so no one knew how powerful they were
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:37:20 ive seen that one before
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:37:22 you posted it here
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:38:33 nowadays the only thing thats considered a shredder is all the tut ones nowadays
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:39:17 i havent seen a custom shredder bug that had nothing from the tut before, nor custom shredder orb, or swarm (swarms nowadays are just bugs but lots instead of actual different things)
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:58:57 tails still gone
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:59:02 thought you evolved
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:18:14 sus
bot-central 2021-08-09 09:21:55 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:22:36 who
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:22:38 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:23:43 lol im actually making its modern version
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:25:01 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:30:23 wdym mig 21 aka motorlocked hotdog with dorito is epic
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:30:28 though i prefer mig 19 more
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:05 he 111
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:29 oh mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:33 my good friend
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:37 and enemy
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:57 it also has the funny wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:13 i forget the name
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:31 the funny wings what are they called
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:38 the f something has it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:48 WHY IS MY MIND BLANK RN
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:33:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:33:44 but i also cant remember the goddamn funny jet f something that i built before with the funny wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:06 f14
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:31 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:40 which is why i stopped doing mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:46 or mig 27 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:36:45 doesnt that one also have a bomb bay
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:36:56 or am i thinking of one of the other ww2 russian fighters
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:37:29 i find it easier for larger build
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:37:39 especially if you dont want cheese shredder wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:01 but for smol fighters like this i would say a hybrid of wasd and mouse
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:19 lol ive seen you ingame before
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:30 wasd is easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:53 and with large things mouse sometimes glitches out
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:03 idk what build you had
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:09 i just remember laughing at your name
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:23 i knew it was a yak
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:39 i cant remember
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:53 i was guessing
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:12 when i was trying to remember what plane it was i thought yak something
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:25 im not a genius on russian ww2 planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:34 except that they had a fighter with a bomb bay
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:47 as i said
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:41:24 yup it was a yak
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:41:33 yak 9b
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:42:07 the ww2 russian fighter with a bomb bay
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:42:36 cheese grater wings are the worst
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:42:46 i would suggest seamless wasd flaps
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:44:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:45:00 basically you just motorlock them from a tower into the wing
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:45:59 ok im leaving now
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:46:04 because ineed to focus on my plene
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:47:59 talk enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:48:13 just join in on conversations and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:58:25 what are you building
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:58:39 is that the mig 23 with different camo?
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:02:10 6/10
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:02:15 needs paintjob
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:02:35 probably
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:02:44 you asked
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:03:18 you literally asked me to rate it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:03:27 and i did
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:03:48 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:04:01 some people need to be ready for getting comments when asking for their jet to be rated
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:04:40 'can someone just rate my jet so far'
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:04:47 i did as i was told
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:04:58 and i rated the so far
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:05:16 'so far' tends to mean it needs improvement
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:05:27 so i was basingmy ratingin what i thought it would look like later on
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:05:42 so i was ready for a higher rating when its done
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:05:50 it seems you arent reading my things either
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:06:04 thats not what i said
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:06:15 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:06:30 you know what
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:06:54 its impossible to win an argument with someone who wont read the goddamn messages correctly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:06:56 goodbye
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:12:04 ok actually im back to tell this one point
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:12:13 im basing my rating as if it was done already
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:13:01 i would say your jet is pretty nice already, i actually really like it, but if you were to post it in creations as it is it would end badly, then i commented on how you might be able to improve it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:13:24 usually i find most ratings are similar to mine; 6 points for design and 4 for paint
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:13:41 so you got an overall good rating if you didnt want to put paint on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:14:23 i wasnt trying to be rude, sorry if it came across like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:16:28 good
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:17:16 yeah i was confused on how you didnt see it my way but i always forget that through just texts people read things very differently
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 03:17:30 also i didnt explain that well
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:24:41 ok whats up with the artillery on the back of trucks
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:24:45 ive seen a lot of it recently
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:26:08 epic
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:26:22 what did both of your plenes look like
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:32:29 i was dogfighting with someone yesterday who had a generic aerial defense plane that was tearing my buccaneer apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:32:52 and it was such a large target but had small columns that connected it together that it was impossible to hit
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:32:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:09 its literally got russian stars
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:26 he should make a yak 9b
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:29 bomber fighter
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:43 i see
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:45 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:50 there are some cures for this
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:52 uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:52 like
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:33:53 idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:35:52 i remember smiley got mad because i was trying to remember what the yak 9b was and he said yak 2 i knew it was a yak so i agreed and he started saying i was wrong and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:35:57 it was very entertaining
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:38:13 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:38:28 too bad thats one i know
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:39:02 im just not the fastest at recognizing the russian ww2 planes as well as i can with german and american ww2 planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:39:09 or british
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:39:50 wait im confused on what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:41:08 i must just need to evolve to understand this new language
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:42:57 yeah...
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:45:57 nah nah use jet engine
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:45:59 weak kick
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:47:51 jet engine eats them
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:47:54 if it was realistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:48:16 like the one scene in incredibles that gave me nightmares when i was little
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:49:39 they glitch out
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 07:49:53 they dont actually connect sometimes

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:15:46 i dont like it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:16:00 if you fixed the cheese graterness stuff it would be cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:16:38 anyone know how to make good burning trails for my strategic bombers engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:16:46 ive tried some but i cant get it right
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:17:56 hello anyone?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:18:30 actually it has four different colors
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:18:50 ive tried many things
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:18:58 i want the mix of smoke and fire
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:23:20 i find that snow pipe isnt transparent enough for the fire bit of the smoke trails though
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:33:05 yes bigger plots would be fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:48:05 and such a weak spot
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:01:35 should i finish my he177 now (just needs tail and flaps) or go and try to finish my old c17 build
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 02:04:03 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 07:41:41 i finally finished my he 177
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:41:21 i hate having a million things to build
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:41:28 then when im playing i forget them all
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:25:15 its very easy. you bring out the build tool then go to discord and click these buttons very quickly in order: tab 8 times, press enter, down arrow 6 times, and then spam enter until your build pops up
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:29:02 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:29:11 lol for me it leaves the server
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:29:26 down arrow 6 times not 1
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:29:43 
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:30:33 for me it doesnt lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:30:48 for me it goes to server boost the first time i click down arrow lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:33:42 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:35:21 why
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:35:28 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:38:53 thought it was level 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:41:53 or just dont use them
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:42:10 use epic ww2 strategic bomber with turrets that dont shoot because they look bad with guns so the barrels are trails
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:43:47 yes but interior go brr
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:50:34 i mean at least your shredders are custom
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:50:38 those are rare nowadays
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:51:51 thats a tut?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:51:54 its really bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:52:09 i find bugs harder to kill
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:52:13 orbs are easy targets
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:52:19 ew
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:52:32 yes they are
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:52:53 which would be 100% of orbs i see?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:53:08 yes that happens
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:53:13 but i still am better
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:53:36 orbs are just easy targets idk what else to say
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:54:18 my jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:54:31 its in creations
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:54:33 the buccaneer
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:54:41 though its got better speed and armaments now
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:54:45 but looks basically the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:09 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:12 beefy boi
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:16 its a british jet bomber
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:28 they basically look like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:42 but as i said mine is more modified then then
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:55:49 rockets, guns, fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:56:09 very
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:56:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:56:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:56:46 doubt all you like
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:56:48 i do
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:57:02 its like a loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:57:11 a very tight loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:57:57 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:58:06 no i think you are thinking of an immelman
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:58:14 a loop is a full circle
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:58:42 thats what i said
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:58:53 an immelman is a half loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:59:06 a kulbit is a full loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:59:15 kinda
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 20:59:53 thats basically what it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:00:01 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:00:02 a loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:01:40 first is an immelman, second is a kulbit (sorry im bad i did that in like 2 seconds)
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:02:37 a kulbit is a tight loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:04:00 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:04:20 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:04:49 its a bit more like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:05:16 a slight stall loop thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:06:00 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:06:07 but technically it is a loop
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:06:32 nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:07:38 yeah thats gonna happen to my neck in a couple minutes
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 21:08:19 oo nice

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:24:40 oh i almost made that plane multiple times
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:25:04 it looks a lot like it though lol

plane-crazy 2021-09-26 06:24:23 all my motorlocc jets melt then theres my buccaneer that is motorlocked but can stand serious punishment before death including the loss of wings, tail, intakes, basically anything except for the fuselage. The fuselage has the least motorloccs and also has enough propellors and stuff to fly without anything else
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 06:25:57 its so hard to make a spaceship without zero grav
plane-crazy 2021-09-26 06:31:23 hello

plane-crazy 2021-09-28 04:37:40 👍
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:48:47 so tempted to give my new spaceship im making tnt armor
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:48:56 ive become goldensword
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:51:07 tf
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:53:45 reminds me of the time i told someone tnt doesnt take damage to explosives, he said they did, i literally tested it with him then said again it doesnt take damage, he got mad and we tested it together AGAIN, i say again that i was still right and tnt doesnt take damage to explosive damage, he gets mad again, repeat the test and stuff 2 more times then he rage quit
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 02:55:31 what is going on
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:00:42 i used to make builds with tons of small blocks and stuff instead of beams so that they would be more durable in pvp. only recently i realized that i should use tnt and 1x7 beams because most of the time you will be shot out of the sky using rockets or fireworks so it would actually be more durable if you use those (unless the enemy is only using guns)
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:28:01 hi GammaRad

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:10:54 this is vertically symmetrical right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:11:12 wait i dont think that ones symmetrical lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:11:31 heres a really nice looking one
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:11:41 <@!581412939223924767> is this what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:26 i would do my custom ones but i dont have the time to do find them rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:29 o
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:31 oooooo
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:33 im dumb
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:36 im also making one rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:13:27 thats what i think when vertically symmetrical
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:13:35 i think of the vertical warships that are the same on each side
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:05 which
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:13 tall or normal but same on each side
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:51 makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:15:15 the reason its more easy to fly a plane with two wings compared to one
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:16:18 lucasfilms last or disney last
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:16:36 sorry im kinda a star wars nerd
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:18:54 this maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:19:35 idk im trying to find what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:20:26 its not entirely symmetrical but thats fine he can change it if he decides to use it
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:23:39 ?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:20 rockets should do a bit more damage i feel
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:24 like 15
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:26 or 13
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:38 but besides that it seems pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:45 cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:26:54 my mig 15
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:27:26 it looked so good but then some random motorlocc glitched out of nowhere and i cant find where it came from because i had so much motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:27:35 and it was in the most infuriating place
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:27:40 right behind the tail
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:31:13 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:31:22 aeronautical engineer is easiest
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:34:20 i do, dont i?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:34:22 where did it go
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:34:30 its gone
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:34:36 my aeronautical engineer rank is gone lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:35:22 didnt even know it was a meme i just knew the song
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:37:07 grr im gonna have to fold my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:37:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:37:41 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:37:55 now thats a good question
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:38:09 i honestly dont know i always fold from the outside
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:38:39 im not that great either thats why im dreading having to do it on the build im doing rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:46:49 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:21 nothing
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:28 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:28 trainer plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:38 those intakes...
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:46 please
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:47:52 tell me thats not final
bot-central 2021-09-30 04:53:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:53:19 thats better
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:55:42 wait how do you get color roles or do you need expert
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:59:32 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:33:52 i have a friend who doesnt build things that look that good but he can build them really fast and work really well
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:34:04 he built a perfectly stable ship in 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:34:28 kill it
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:40:09 are 1x7 still explosion proof
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:40:34 lots of shermans had either the 75 or the 76mm gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:41:03 yes but are they
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:44:17 unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:45:47 yw
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:46:33 ah
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:48:30 probably
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 05:48:34 its a bit chunky
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 03:39:39 when i tried treads they kept falling off lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 03:48:48 how to make conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 03:49:38 thats a prettybad pic
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 03:50:10 but anyways how do i make a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 03:50:37 wow
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:05:25 ive just created a new glitch engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:09:17 im hitting 12k
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:09:51 its hard to control though
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:13:13 anchor blocks connected to unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:13:29 sometimes it doesnt work but sometimes you just break the sound barrier
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:16:04 its really hard to control
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:16:53 which reminds me
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:17:02 how do you make a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 04:17:48 m
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:09:38 im bored of the spaceship im making
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:16:04 anyone know what the bulge on the side of the ac130h  is
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:16:52 the one just under the nose there
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:17:01 its not on the other side so it makes me wonder
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:19:47 weird that it isnt somewhere else like the nose cone though
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:19:57 that would slow it down quite a bit
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:20:31 true
creations-chat 2021-10-01 05:22:49 eh
they pressured me into it
but yeah i agree
I wasnt really looking for upvotes though
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:24:59 its a night vision radar
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:25:12 i went through some public government files i found lol
creations-chat 2021-10-01 05:26:16 it was an old build and i never really was gonna show it anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:26:31 cia.gov is its url
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:26:43 pretty great lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:27:32 https://www.cia.gov/

plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:49:41 sounds fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:50:05 what if its a modern tank
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:50:56 i mean i take in sps as kph so mine would go its real life speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:52:03 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 05:52:14 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:33:09 WHY DOES MY DESTROYER ALWAYS CRASH MY GAME
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:33:17 only in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:33:39 at first i thought it was the torpedoes but when i remove them it still crashes
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:34:19 i love the classic house
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:34:26 i saw a really cursed one earlier today actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:34:32 it was like a spider
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 06:35:23 sneke
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:51:40 ive seen an f22 irl
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:52:03 it was smaller than i expected
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:52:22 ooo
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:52:55 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:12 the goddamn chinooks...
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:22 and c17 are the loud ones here
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:29 and the occasional fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:41 pointy
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:45 wait what plane is it
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:53:57 mmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:54:33 just do some anglelocking for the spine
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:57:08 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:57:22 rc asked what blocks we needed and i told him that
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:57:32 he said he would try
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:57:43 so hopefully in pc 2 there are more
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 07:59:13 i mean winter isnt that far away
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:16:14 time to go make custom jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:16:15 mm
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:20:46 what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:22:24 whats in vip 1
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:22:44 i know what it is
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:22:48 but whats going on in it
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:23:32 games have broken anti hack systems and you get banned for something they did wrong in their code... I have much experience with this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:23:40 i lost like 400 hours in something because of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:23:56 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:24:25 for some reason my wifi is so goddamn bad rn
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:27:52 maybe just a glitch
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:33:36 but that requires skill
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:33:47 its surprisingly hard to line up shots
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:33:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:33:55 but no
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:34:02 only for large targets
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:34:30 ive got one good custom design for an atgm
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:35:03 oh yeah dont you have the one where you dump 50 bombs on a target and run away
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:35:07 or was that someone else
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:35:30 im gonna go restart my computer and hope it works this time
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:35:49 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:35:54 those shoot me down all the time
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:36:01 will my 'swirly jet'
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:36:23 the gun ones work well
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:36:27 just a line of brrt
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:36:57 its easier to hit with gun brrt then missile with an aa
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:37:19 duh
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:37:22 its a big target
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:37:34 ok now im actually gonna reset my computer
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:39:21 there
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:39:26 hopefully roblos will work now
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:40:05 i tried making a zep once but couldnt shape the nose bit correctly
i made a sci fi gunship and multiple times accidentally made a perfect zep nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:40:56 fire
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:41:22 object 234 or whatever the nuke surviving one was
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:41:27 make that
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:41:43 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:41:56 i meant 279
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:42:04 the quad track one lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:46:40 when you are trying to make a mini jet because those are popular ish now but you dont know how to hide your motorlocc in your 1x1 thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:46:53 i can hide one side with my cockpit but how do i hide the other side
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 08:58:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:17:36 man gets angry after i break his lag machine into not working
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:17:45 rip
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:44:52 anyone know how to make a good afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:45:15 the ones i find on yt are bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:45:48 all the ones ive seen
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:53:50 ive never seen this one before lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:28:15 when your custom jet somehow looks like a gripen
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:37:56 yeah build viper
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:06:49 ok so i used to think you needed more wing panels to stop the wobbling of your plane but ive basically got a flying wing and wont stop wobbling
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:06:56 so what can i do to make it not wobble
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:09:16 it aint bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:09:32 mig 15 is cancer to make
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:10:01 i tried making mig 15 it looked good and all but then it just died because motorlocc glitch made big exposed motorlocc and i couldnt find out how
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:11:01 so uh anyone wanna answer how i can stop the wobble
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:12:39 its slow...
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:12:47 and i basically have a flying wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:17:14 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:23:30 so i made a custom jet but it looks like a mig 21, gripen, and mirage had a child
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:23:31 
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:24 ok actually what causes shake
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:31 i just doubled my wingspace
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:38 so im double delta wing now
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:44 and it shakes when i hit 200
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:50 maybe thats it
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:26:55 im gonna remove my hoverdrive
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:28:15 thats what it was
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:33:17 nvm the shake is still there
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:37:20 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:38:20 thats common
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:38:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:39:08 its roblox's broken physics engine that makes it common
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:40:27 i do it with anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:40:39 i move nowhere so fast i go 80 times the speed of light
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:41:04 your nose is a bit long
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:41:16 sexc
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:21 bro like actually
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:25 the wobble
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:56:30 is really annoying
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:57:21 i have two sets of wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:57:33 and this is my wingspan
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:57:44 ive got wings motorlocced in my wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:57:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:58:16 motorlocc space is gone...
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:58:47 like actually theres nowhere where i can put a tower without it being visible
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 11:59:58 ayo thats a thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:00:28 its probably gonna say what i always say but this build im doing rn is just really broken
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:01:39 'delete blocks' i have 400 blocks in mine...
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:05:19 depends on if your shredder is custom or the tut
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:12:53 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:24:56 its so satisfying when you hit a motorlocc jet with a rocket
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:24:59 they just melt
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:25:08 even when its yourself being shot down it looks so good
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:30:48 anyone got a good pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 12:31:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:21:39 doing gunship battles are fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:21:51 this other guys gunship takes one hit from my atgm and melts
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:28:51 my microphones are buzzing
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:41 why is c17 so popular all of a sudden
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:37:55 in fact i was also making a c17 yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:11:18 i see why you people like mini planes now
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:11:37 although i still dont know how to hide motorloccs in 1x1x3456478
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:12:02 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:12:24 although thats all spelled correctly
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:12:29 👍
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:16:25 m
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:17:29 i accidentally blew myself up along with an enemy ship
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 14:17:35 mission failed successfully
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:32:19 .
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:32:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:36:57 finally figured out how to stop the wobble
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:37:15 its not more wing panels or less blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:37:18 its more blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:38:34 HAHA YES
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:42:03 mach 50 do 17
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:50:52 small
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:51:14 make sci fi gunship
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:51:16 much mroe fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:51:45 doing strafing runs with mine decimates anything below me
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 05:57:00 how do you make suspended armaments look good (im aware of the mistakes in paint i just saw them)
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:05:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:09:33 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:12:05 what do you call the trails from the tips of wings that appear when they turn or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:12:52 vapor trails
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:13:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 06:14:03 would they extend farther than an afterburner

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:18:01 random poll but do you use cylinders or wing panels for motorlocc towers
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 13:18:40 wing panel
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:17:27 should i make chunky wings for su 25 or would it just look weird
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:18:17 alright
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:27:37 just did a sideways cobra while drifting with a limo
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:29:30 but limo
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:30:04 limousine
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:30:37 enough to get you many downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:30:47 im actually pretty good at hiding motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:32:34 wait what the hell
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:32:59 the placement of your thrusters compared to your wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:33:16 damn my first motorlocc fighter jet was actually good
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:34:18 my first motorloccc jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:35:23 sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:35:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:35:48 thought you meant to make it rhyme

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 21:44:19 i was just too lazy to do it
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 22:27:30 idk why but my su 25 has skinny wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 22:28:16

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:07:52 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:08:10 just use tnt lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:08:53 i just made motorless seamless ailerons
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:09:27 it has no motors lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:09:40 ive done seamless many times
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:09:45 but no motor
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:09:52 👍
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:10:23 jk but i hid the motors really well
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:11:43 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:12:03 my first motorlocc is also still my best pvp jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:12:34 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:12:57 also it can stovl because plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:13:00 so thats fun to mess with
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:13:14 slightly delta
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:13:41 mines a jet bomber lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:14:45 not the prettiest but performs so well that
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:14:47 uh
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:14:55 i cant come up with something to end that sentence
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:15:49 theres a mig 21 in creations the second newest build but it has a nose cone instead of the nose being an intake with a triangle inside
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:16:57 this is an old pic though its slightly different now
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:17:04 and has different suspended armaments
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:17:31 rn all i need to do on my frogfoot is put its elevators in and then make it move
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:18:01 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:18:06 show it
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:18:53 damn you post a lot
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:19:04 i only have like 4 posts because idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:19:17 HAHAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:19:18 im sorry
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:19:22 that jet is kinda funny
plane-crazy 2021-10-03 23:24:27 because its spookymonth
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:36:09 vigilance ship
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:36:16 it looks like a vigilance
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:37:45 yeah trains are dumb like that
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:38:10 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:38:19 ive done something very similar once
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:38:33 vuf won
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:38:56 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:39:04 time to finish my su25
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:39:45 then go finish old build cuz it was going good but i got tired of it so after my su25 i will probably finish it
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:40:05 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:45:30 thats what i was thinking
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:47:51 irl though
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:50:48 wait it has no elevators
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:51:12 i dont see any
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:52:17 still dont see one lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:53:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:55:20 yeah...
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:55:24 hate it when that happens
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:55:26 just fold one on
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:57:56 you said that
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:11 you dont need wings in space
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:20 they would be useless
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:33 more weight, larger profile
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:39 basically makes it kinda worse
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:53 plus for a thing to move in space it needs thrust, not flaps
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:59:04 because space is a vacuum
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:59:47 in fact that thing would be impossible to fly in space unless you only want to go in one direction
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:00:31 and now im going to stop talking because ive already wasted tons of time i could be using to finish my su 25
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:06:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:13:26 airbrakes go brr
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:14:11 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:18:19 nah
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:23:52 this is true
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:37:51 very nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:38:12 although it could use with some tiny details, your build style suggests that you could do those easily
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:42:12 and maybe a nice engine trail
creations-chat 2021-10-08 04:47:09 <@!704819435537563689> if you gave a slight darker tone for the area behind the engines like this
but besides that its really nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:55:33 i bet someone has
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 05:23:01 have fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:17:42 when your goddamn disconnectors dont disconnect
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:18:43 im really confused on why they wont disconnect
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:22:45 why wont they
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:33:36 finally finished my su 25
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:33:38 it looks good
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:34:11 but it flies like gravity doesnt exist not in a good way
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:34:55 ill show you later
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:35:00 im gonna sleep now cuz im tired
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 07:35:04 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 07:09:47 nose
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 07:10:15 thats more exposed motorlocc then my drift limo
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 07:11:12 epic
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 07:11:36 ...
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 07:11:43 i hate it when that happens

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:47:43 i found out that that is whats causing my plane to implode
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:48:39 this is how to fold wings right?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:49:12 that also broke
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:49:37 but its on top of a motorlocc tower does that change things
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:51:47 i go over 100 and the motor just breaks
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:51:54 why
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:53:59 im veryconfused still
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:54:22 since when did powerlocked motors break at speeds of 100
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:55:38 nice gun pod

plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:57:28 they just die eventually
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:57:41 smart
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:58:01 i tried doing a kv6 chassis with mine
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:58:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:58:44 i have a thing for having tanks have the exact right amount of wheels inside their tracks
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:58:50 so i need to motorlocc the wheels closer
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:58:57 but then that means i need to motorlocc the tracks on
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 09:59:45 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:00:10 my friend called a zeppelin a blimp
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:00:21 i got out the old blimp v zeppelin documentary
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:00:32 which is just me explaining the difference for an hour and a half
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:01:51 im thinking of redoing my heavy biplane bomber
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:02:03 and giving it an even longer wingspan even though its already massive
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:02:11 giving it two fuselages
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:02:16 and making it a mothership
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:02:31 probably
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:03:24 mutli locc towers for dumb thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:06:07 i was joking i dont actually know
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:06:41 but i guess its just in the name
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:06:52 in fact if it is a thing its probably what i actually said
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:23:08 late end of this year or early next year
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:23:21 84 days
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:23:26 until the end of the year
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:29:42 mech
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:29:53 cuz mech has less harsh requirements
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:32:34 this guy says blacklist isnt working
the guy is also sad that he cant get into my plot after i blacklist him
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 10:32:58 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 11:24:49 i hate the look of the f22
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:06:40 when you accidentally press c in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 15:06:55 you die because you are trying to flip back out of all 300 of your placed cameras

plane-crazy 2021-10-17 08:27:49 is it just me or is it weird that for my builds i have four sets of wings in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 08:31:21 not clickbait
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 08:49:16 the people who get mad when you blacklist them after they spam smoke machines on your plot and keep running you over

plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:05:23 deleted what
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:06:41 is it just me or is the lighting in pvp broken
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:07:37 there is no shadows
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:08:02 also i cant open settings
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:10:56 why are my turrets bouncy
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:11:03 the ground
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:11:17 the ground in the area of the map
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 07:11:41 inbetween the rails
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:45:08 my destroyer does that too
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:45:30 except in pvp it has a bug probably from my lazy motorthings that crashes my game
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 04:46:02 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 05:56:21 when you try to land a zeppelin a carrier half the size
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 06:31:45 gave my zeppelin 4 new bofors instead of the 2 cannons that were on the back
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 06:52:11 anyone got wwi planes or zeppelins
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 06:52:18 we are doing a wwi battle in my server lol

plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:00:15 so how do you do the angled trail for windows
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:00:23 without tons of exposed motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:01:45 i mean how do you get the exact right angle each time
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:33:08 i hate the people who are just like 'sit on my plane now'
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:33:49 same
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 05:38:47 my best pvp plane was my first motorlocc build. its motorlocc is very compact and has no towers

plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:10:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:12:01 when you try to build a plane that looks very.... unique irl... and people are like 'wow you suck at building' even though your build is basically an exact replica
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 09:14:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:30:34 wow
plane-crazy 2021-10-23 10:55:10 camera hell

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:58:17 hopefully the adding more wing panels would work but thats only like a 50/50 chance
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:58:38 ill try
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:59:11 oh i fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:59:15 adding the wing panels worked
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:59:18 usually it doesnt lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 09:59:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:33:08 when do we get half delta wings for the mini missiles
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 10:36:29 too lazy

<:BIG3:588443788721258534> <:BIG4:588443798842114088>
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:16:51 gotta say
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:17:19 if you gave this electric lightning some rockets it would finally be the plane to topple my buccaneer for best pvp build
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 11:17:30 too bad it only goes half the speed of the buccaneer before shaking

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:10:35 cuz bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:10:53 the good thing about multi fold builds are no one expects anglelocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:11:14 you were the one with the broken motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:11:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:11:40 i remember you now
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:11:45 rip

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:13:46 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:30:23 idk maybe just try to redo your rotors
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:31:41 doing kulbits over this guy
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:31:51 he keeps missing by that much because of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:32:36 at least it looks like something
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:32:39 most people just spam
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:34:04 nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:34:50 im tempted to take a copy of my electric lightning, turn it pink and white, then put uwu all over it
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 13:37:33 my computer speakers are getting static-y
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:56:39 why are people saying this it works fine for me
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:56:41 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:56:54 what should the floor of a sci fi carrier hangar be like
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:00 just plain blocks looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:03 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:12 but only for some
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:21 for the ones without they still work
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:35 no..?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:57:55 are your motors both powered and locked?
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:58:08 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:58:14 plain blocks look boring
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:58:24 but my normal ladder design makes wheels fall through
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 21:58:30 not great for a hangar
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:11:21 welp
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:11:31 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:11:41 it seems only like 4/10 people have broken motors
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 22:14:25 anyone notice that placing blocks doesnt make a song play anymore
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:43 my friend made a spaceship thats hof worthy
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:16:48 only thing is he isnt in this server
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:17:53 bigger mountains
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:18:13 with tons of ravines to dogfight in (or outrun a shredder orb)
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:05 when your gustav gun is actually just a 12.7 mm mg 
i hate when people do that to their builds it looks so bad this guy even has room for something besides just gun
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:16 copy and paste tool (from your own plot)
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:24 or a symmetry tool
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:22:55 too expensive
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:23:05 thats what i do
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:23:33 ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:23:44 nah i build in random publics most of the time
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:23:53 tnt would be dumb
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:24:02 always just use helium scaffolding
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:24:33 also you are the second person (including me) that i know of who uses helium scaffolding
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:26:59 ye but then i fall off or load my thing in and its a pain to do it each time
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:27:17 so i just stick some wedges on for ladders and some helium so it just goes poof when i spawn
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:27:54 ?

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:28:49 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:29:04 its always a pain when modern jets shoot down your wwi bomber
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:29:57 modern plane shoot down plane that is 103 years older than it
plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:30:58 wwi ended 1918

plane-crazy 2021-10-24 23:53:48 if you hit any of my motorlocc jets there they explode

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:06:04 if you get dependent on rockets your aim goes to shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:06:09 try using fireworks instead
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:06:31 same effect as rockets but if you spam click its faster plus it gets your aiming skills better
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 00:06:32 how

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 14:00:58 this is the biplane its got a bit of exposed motorlocc and stuff but flies very well, (fast and maneuverable) and also has light stable flight at highs speeds as well as like completely stable flight as in going straight not gaining altitude or losing altitude by doing literally nothing which i accidentally put into my plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 14:01:28 i call it the Ra.3
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 14:02:07 *and i only just recently realized its basically a supersized version of the biplane i had on my flying aircraft carrier which was another biplane that carries biplanes*
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 14:05:19 Rausch
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 14:05:34 a fictional aircraft company that i basically put all my custom planes under

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:41:48 taking out supersonic jets with a biplane never gets old
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:42:43 why is the spine like that though
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:43:49 the a4 spine isnt like that still
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:44:38 
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:45:16 im guessing you are making the A4E (because thats the israeli one in wt)
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:45:25 and the E variant has that spine
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:45:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:46:56 me literally naming a variant like one message above
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:47:33 yes you are right although i cant find any Israeli skyhawks with the camel spine
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:48:12 how
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:49:54 lol i had to scroll like 7 rows down to find one like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:50:21 i did
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:50:41 and i also searched up 'israeli skyhawk late' still popped up far down the list
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:50:49 because google is smart
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:51:01 thinks late means early or something lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:51:05 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:51:55 i can count five that dont
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:52:34 well actually only the late variant does....
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:52:43 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:53:40 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 11:03:59 I JUST HIT THE NICEST SHOT EVER
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 11:04:10 did a kulbit to get a guy off my tail

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 11:06:46 m yes like i can take a pic while shooting it and know that i need to take a pic when i didnt expect it to work

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 12:56:57 ok im not making su t-4 anymore because yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 12:57:01 what else should i make
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:47:22 wot
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:52:09 when someone copies your build but its worse
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:52:42 idk if they copied it
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:52:53 but theres a mini ee lighting in creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:53:01 that is the exact same thing as mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:53:53 except ive got better camo and used disconnectors to hide motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:54:55 and the coverage of my back thrusters actually exist
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:54:59 but thats like four blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:55:07 besides that literally everything else is the same
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:55:17 their character is even in the same place
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:55:33 and i put my seat laying down face down farther back in the fuselage than most people
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:55:40 but they put theirs in the exact same place
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:56:13 another thing is my creation is the newest one besides theirs which would mean if they looked it up to see ideas mine would be the first thing they see
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:57:13 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:57:19 i think you do the rank request
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 22:58:53 im just pissed this guy pretty much copied my build
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:04:43 shredder orbs are so slow
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:04:59 just outrunning one in a biplane
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:16:42 i said english electric lightning
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:17:03 thats a completely different plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:18:01 yeah this one was mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:18:14 and this one is theirs
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:18:53 oh you cant see my body sticking out of the plane in that one to show that the seat is in the same place because i was behind it for that picture
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:19:12 theirs has incomplete thruster cover and also holes of uncovered motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:19:32 but besides that theirs is an exact replica
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:21:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:22:00 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:22:45 some do but very few
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:23:20 the one i gave it was the most common one
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:24:13 the green one was very uncommon for an ee lightning
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:25:11 because camo was no longer of much use due to radars evolving
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:25:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:26:40 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:28:36 why so many springs
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:29:14 how to get anger out of my system after someone copies me: build **swordfish**
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 23:29:50 bri'ish

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:10:43 should i ask the guy who copied my build then sent the replica in creations why he copied my build
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:13:25 should i
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:16:05 its a type of russian cow
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:16:19 lol

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:19:43 HAHAHA YES LOL
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:29:11 the gripen is a great light fighter (so many people compare it to heavy fighters)
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:29:20 but i dont like the gripen
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:29:50 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:30:08 flying catfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 06:30:15 the real fishbed lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:04:57 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:05:14 how did you get yourself a creations blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:06:13 m but they dont blacklist the person who copied me (although i havent asked them to)
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:12:00 the guy who copied me has better ranks then me so mods might respect him more than me
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:14:01 the thing i always get in wt because i always get up-tiered
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:14:47 mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:15:14 and his
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:15:21 and his
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:15:27 sorry took a while to get the pics because wifi sucky
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:16:09 no thats him and his friend
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:16:19 he posted it in creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:16:38 alright
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:17:09 <@!773287769488752653> any reason why your ee lightning is an exact replica of mine?
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:17:22 wait i should dm it probably
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:18:37 main reason why only 10% of my creations go into the creations thing because ive started building mini but i really liked that build and it looks kinda crap but also decent and does pvp so damn well I was proud of it 
pride only brings suffering (people copying your builds lol)
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:18:56 should i dm him about it or just have that one ping
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:19:39 *mods make me anxious*
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:22:01 fdghfhdsghjgfdsa agreed
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:22:16 theres some pics up there
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:23:15 i just dont like talking to mods after i got banned from a game that i had over 300 hours in due to their mods being corrupt and me being completely innocent
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:23:36 well actually there are lots of exposed motorloccs on theirs
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:25:17 no idea why the marker is blue but theres some very exposed motorlocc on theirs not even covered up by wing or disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:25:42 forgot to mention their one under the wing by the back landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:26:05 nick_thecoolguy847

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:26:55 idk their seat even is in the exact same spot as mine and i moved mine into an area that is a bit farther away and also laying face up
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:27:06 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:27:38 i did
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:27:53 not yet

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:29:48 I SPELL SOMETHING WRONG AND IT DOES NOTHING BUT I DO SOMETHING LIKE 'mod' or 'plan' and it adds an E i mean i understand mod being mode but WHY TURN PLAN INTO PLANE
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:30:03 anyways how was your day
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:30:23 yeah ive seen plenty of mini ee but none that ever looked that similar to mine

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 07:31:54 i would except it took me forever to make something mini (it was my first mini plane) and it just pissed me off that he got the entire plane basically made for him already whereas i had to spend time on the body

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:23:30 sounds normal
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:25:07 wait thats kinda slow for that many hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:25:31 *although i did have the one plane with 30 max speed hovers that only went 80*
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 08:29:06 yes and
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:14:25 i somehow attached a torp to my swordfish

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 12:56:08 why are delta wing planes so much of a pain
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:07:03 nice back
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:08:38 old bug
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:14:44 when someone using a shredder orb tut calls your advanced motorlocc build a tut
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:15:21 they are calling it 'the most common tut on yt'
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:18:11 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 13:23:27 they were mad because the server ganged up on them
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 23:24:44 不，Ju 88
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 23:26:40 why
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:19:48 lol what was the build like
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:20:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:21:01 ive got just the one
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:21:07 mi 4
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:21:21 mi 4 is very hot (not) soviet heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:28:23 the second you sent this my wifi crashed lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:28:40 nononno
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:28:43 make mi 10
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:29:01 giraffe copter
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:29:11 one of my favorites lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:29:30 or do mi 8 because they just are so nice looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:30:28 mi 8 though
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:30:35 is just so good looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:30:41 for a utility helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:31:15 pretty sure its the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:32:36 coax
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:32:51 do the uh ka 50 or something for those rotors
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:34:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:38:06 haha
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:38:15 thats what i do
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:38:24 but at the same time im crap at heli so dont listen to me
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:44:49 just make one of the heli that work like vtol planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:45:04 everyone tries to make heli that work like heli which is much harder and worse for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:45:41 *I have a plane that can do that*
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:45:54 nice tiltrotor
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:46:46 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:47:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:48:43 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:49:59 idk but i thought they said they would keep motorlocc or add a block meant for motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:51:19 m yes powerlocked
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:52:58 hopefully there is a much bigger airfield too
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 00:54:36 ive never had that problem... okay
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:01:22 i understand now its because im weird
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:02:01 i keep getting you two mixed up because of similar pfp
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:03:33 yes ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:03:48 ive seen both plenty of times
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:05:12 m...
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:11:40 those things help kinda but not really
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:12:55 i watched it, did everything it said to fix my heli, none of that worked, did something my own way and then it worked my way
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:24:08 use 99 99 99 for the exhaust or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:24:13 that seems a bit dark
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:24:53 still that seems too dark
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:25:18 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:25:52 but most diesel exhaust is a bit lighter than that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:26:32 well...
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:26:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:26:48 make it like 90 90 90
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:26:57 i find that the nineties are the best for diesel exhaust
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:27:52 its better to have tons of details and some exposed then no details
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:28:28 large builds have enough room to not need as much detail so motorlocc isnt very great for it but for smaller builds its essential for details
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:28:43 i find it looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:28:48 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:29:01 larger builds dont need it as much
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:29:27 you are welcome
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:44:33 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:44:47 wtf is this first one
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:44:57 me always
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:45:23 pontoons are so broken
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:45:34 they are very bouncy when on water
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:46:09 so much stuff on the floor
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:46:29 it does
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:46:49 go get hof with that lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:17 they are good for that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:25 but using pontoons as pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:29 thats where they break
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:47 jeez
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:09 i cant spend more than two days on a build before going 'ah this is boring'
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:42 yes what
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:51 exactly what i do

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:13:37 oh thats what it was
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:15:04 exposed motorlocc <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:15:31 i accidentally made my mi 8 cockpit look good
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:36:25 can someone explain why when i turn my plane one way it goes the OPPOSITE WAY
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:36:54 it should do this
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:37:22 but mine does this
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:37:32 and it doesnt have any internal props or anything that do that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:37:41 so it should be turning like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:37:50 but it is turning like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:37:52 i dont understand
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:38:25 my su 25 does it too
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:38:50 please
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:38:53 help nasa
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:39:19 nasa is very confused
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:39:23 help nasa
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:39:41 as in?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:39:58 what im saying is it rolls this way but turns that way
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:40:24 i would send a video but computer cant download a video after i take it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:40:28 it rolls the right way
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:40:38 but it banks the opposite way
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:40:59 my plane will roll like this one but turn in the direction of the black line there
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:42:15 ive tried...
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:43:18 idk whats up with it lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:47:33 is it possible for wing panels to be upsidedown or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:47:46 and generate lift the opposite way
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:47:56 because thats what it seems like they are doing on this build
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:48:41 well they do create lift
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:48:43 just barely any
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:49:53 i mean like
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:50:09 i have a plane that can takeoff and go up without any help from elevators or anything like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:50:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:50:55 *its front very heavy*
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:51:22 imagining
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:53:25 looks like a tiger
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:59:35 i fixed the thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:59:40 using eight propellors
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 07:59:43 because big wing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:01:34 propellors
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:01:38 or bigger elevators
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:01:51 for props put them at the nose and tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:02:03 tu 22
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:05:20 nsfw??
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:05:38 very sexc
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:06:07 sadly
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:10:18 i just realized
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:10:23 what happened to ifkin
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:09 HAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:12 I DID IT AGAIN
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:16:27 DID A KULBIT AND SHOT MY ROCKETS AT A SHREDDER MID KULBIT AND IT KILLED IT
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:17:05 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:17:13 this shredder keeps attacking me
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:17:16 i keep kulbitting on him
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:17:21 only hit him once mid kulbit though
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:19:33 dont got any
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:19:44 1 block plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:19:57 plus idk how to put them in
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:20:03 because one block plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:30:06 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:30:51 300 is like enough speed for me to be happy and yeah most of my planes go about 300-400 because bad stability
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:31:13 i have no need to go faster than that
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:31:15 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:31:33 i mean 300 is enough to outrun most shredders, 400 is about all shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:31:51 my first motorlocc jet is still the fastest
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:05 why not
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:21 welp
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:30 try to shoot down my swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:32:50 cant
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 08:33:04 swordfish is too sexc for you

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:47:20 they used to be only made by super smart people and be like god builds but nowadays there are like 50 tuts out there with low quality shredders that are easy to counter
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 09:47:54 yeah thats what happens

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:24:32 yes thats always true
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:25:19 depends on the plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:26:16 i think bombers are considered female
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:26:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:27:01 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:27:22 submarines are the size of ships but called boats
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:27:29 some planes are called ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:27:46 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:28:34 imagine being on the battlefield and your entire battalion gets gunned down by anime covered helicopter driven by hot japanese girl
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 06:28:45 must be embarrassing

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:13:41 wait it had the funny symbol on it
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:14:18 there now imagine it with the cockpit as the nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:14:27 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:14:53 third one was always my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:15:09 pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:15:27 i might make that plane but with the cockpit as the nose instead of tail
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:15:41 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:16:28 first mecha is just a slightly obese man doing kung fu in a rubber suit lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:16:33 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:17:15 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:17:19 HAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:17:25 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:17:47 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:17:52 real not clickbait
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:18:43 this has just become <#497142796961054721> but mechagodzilla
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:19:14 ww2 y wing just realized it looks like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 07:19:22 only the old ones

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:29:21 yeah what that doesnt deserve that much
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:29:24 HOLY
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:29:30 THATS BEAUTIFUL
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:30:05 i kinda want to make a cardboard plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:30:34 might make my swordfish cardboard
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:31:31 going to go make my swordfish cardboard
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:47:50 welp i finished my cardboard swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:48:25 time to go troll in a pvp server with cardboard plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:48:51 just keep talking and you can
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 08:50:59 just blew up a car with a cardboard torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:03:14 so i did a bit of things to my cardboard swordfish and now it is like 10 times better than the normal version
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:15:23 i made a guy ragequit by using someone elses build in build mode and whenever he looked away i would just shoot at him a little bit until all the little bits lead to him being very dead
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:15:53 using a very funny little wwi car with a tiny turret mounted to the back
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:17:27 why
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:17:35 just look up a color's id
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:18:39 anyone realize how the ka 50 fuselage looks a lot like the su 25 fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:20:13 in fact i might just use my su 25 fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:20:43 holy nevermind i forgot how much motorlocc is on that build like 7 towers
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 09:20:48 i cant tell what is what
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 10:42:52 WHAT
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 10:48:17 this guy came up to me, said 'young fly on the track' and left
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:02:08 holy
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:02:15 yes i agree
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:02:39 either there would be lots of explicit things or you would need to go through this super complicated thing to get your image confirmed
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:04:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:04:35 bri'ish air force symbol is pretty easy to make
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:08:37 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:11:49 yeah thats what i said
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:19:48 welp i just made my first working helicopter in over half a year
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:21:29 oh didnt even know you were talking about heli when i said this
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:22:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:22:13 unless you make it fly like a plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:25:48 or use signs as the rotor blades lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:25:59 and use internal wing panels and props to lift it
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:26:03 like i did on this one
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:26:10 its so much easier
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:43:25 why not
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:43:26 they work well
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:43:30 and look the same
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:46:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:47:01 fly well
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 11:47:14 doesnt get stuck in spins like the rotor ones do
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:23:00 wdym they dont have movement
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:23:16 and the blade is just as thick as wing panel
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:23:28 they spin
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:23:34 thats enough pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:23:56 and i could make the rotors rotate a bit if i wanted
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:24:05 it just uses signs so that there isnt the drag
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:27:00 not if you add less interior props
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:27:26 i would take a vid of mine flying but haha computer does a funny and deletes video instantly
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:29:17 still what
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:31:03 yeah wing panel drag in pc is so unrealistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:34:47 but it wont ever be as precise
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:35:11 using signs looks exactly the same except easier to control/no suttle spinning
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:39:34 omg it is hd
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:40:42 fake rotor heli are the same exact build except you dont need to counter the rotary drag
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:42:29 heli that use wing panel rotors and heli that use sign rotors
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:43:20 why use rockets lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:43:25 just use motor
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:44:08 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:44:30 just angle the wing panel rotors with motor 2 or something
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:44:37 like an elevator
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:45:22 yoo
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:46:23 because it doesnt make your helicopter spin out in one direction
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:47:04 its still easier to use signs
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:47:19 *especially when making tailless heli*
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:47:30 you dont need to worry about spinning out
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:48:11 looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:48:51 wrong
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:49:58 for one block heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:52:46 still it looks 100 times better without
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:53:49 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:54:23 ill agree to disagree
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:57:24 m thanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:57:34 i find it amusing
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:57:54 the copying and/or calling your builds tuts i dont like
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:57:58 but i love the fighting
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:58:13 they cant comprehend someone who isnt a youtuber being able to build
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:58:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 12:58:43 i keep getting crapped on by this jet going 2k
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:00:00 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:00:08 exposed you only use tuts or copy
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:00:11 jk jk
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:03:30 some kid came up to me once while i was in my advanced motorlocc fighter bomber jet and went 'we all need to start somewhere but do you really need to use the most popular tutorial on youtube'
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:03:57 and he had a dumb friend or another monitor open who started saying the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:04:04 i told them to tell me what tutorial it was
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:04:09 and they both just left the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:04:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:06:22 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:07:58 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:09:40 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:10:02 i hate it when you accidentally press your angle lock button after locking
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:10:59 for anglelocking?
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:11:37 i use 1 as anchor, 2 as propellor (if a prop thing) otherwise for 2 and up i use for things like anglelocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:13:52 t is conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:14:10 i dont usually
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 13:14:11 but when i do

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 08:03:35 sorry i mean west taiwan
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 08:59:50 it sucks when you are decimating a pvp server just groundpounding their stuff with your heli and then you disconnect
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 09:00:01 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 09:00:13 but stealth isnt fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 09:00:37 damn you arent ranked
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 09:00:45 so you cant use the vips
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 09:00:59 its more fun to groundpound in clear sight
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 10:11:38 some noob was inspecting my heli but accidentally jumped into one of the rotors and got flung
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 10:21:27 wow looks better than the real jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 10:23:42 nothing his f35 is hot
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 10:23:47 the real one though looks kinda bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 10:26:57 yup

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 11:19:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 11:19:35 the trees were a bit forced but here the sand is nice

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:38:19 beating up modern heli with century old triplanes
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:38:24 plane crazy never gets old
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:47:41 now that one is nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:48:11 i dont even know how you have room on your plot after such a large motorlocc build but somehow you got (it looks like) a motorlocc terrain as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:50:52 still i make very compact motorlocc builds but my towers go to the height limit too
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:51:24 i do both
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:57:23 that would get so destroyed in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:57:45 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:58:42 now i want to ground pound your tank
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 12:59:30 i was in a server earlier and there was a guy with a tiger the size of the king tiger up there and i destroyed him so fast (3 seconds of time, destroyed in one strafe) wdym
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:00:11 oh no lag bombs in pc 2 where there are bigger plots
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:00:39 what did you delete
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:01:12 nukes in pc are so useless
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:01:47 except it lags more
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:01:52 they still have the same explosive radius as if it wasnt motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:22:16 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 13:43:00 its nice

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 07:12:12 and even if there is one they are so easy to counter
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 07:15:15 fdgmhgfds i want to build an attack heli but none of the ones that are there irl but i need some sort of image to go off of or my building skills are very crappy but i cant find any fictional attack heli that arent futuristic.

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 07:19:23 looks like the italian attack heli lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 07:20:51 italian version

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 07:57:48 i hate how everyone thinks its a b29 just seeing the nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 07:58:12 ive had like 17 people come up to my he 177 and go 'you are missing two engines on your b29'
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 07:58:32 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 07:59:01 yup
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:00:54 to be fair nobody can make a good looking fw 190 in this game
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:01:41 ive tried a couple times
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:01:55 wow that
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:03:39 either that or something weird like 'b2 bomber requesting a chance to land on the carrier'
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:04:25 the people who get mad when you slap them in pvp so they go 'well of course i lost you are using a tut'
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:04:41 just evolve
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:04:51 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:05:07 i just built that yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:05:32 he 162
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:05:42 nice komet bro
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:05:56 HAHAHA
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:06:04 ok what should i build
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:06:34 over half my builds are from that
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:06:55 its like the most common tree to build from lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:07:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:07:09 because they arent generic prop planes lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:07:25 *just yesterday i built two from luft 46*
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:07:45 triplane*
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:08:12 i kind of want to build this but its so small and simple that i would need to do really good to make it somewhat okay
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:08:22 i swear it was a triplane
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:08:32 sopwith triplane lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:09:28 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:09:32 its sad because its true
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:09:37 most of the time
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:11:18 yeah they dont go 'wow nice chunky wings with gear that fold into the wings so that they are not visible in flight' they dont go 'nice german camo' they dont go 'nice realistic engines with fire and smoke.'
 instead they say (what i said they say earlier about the he 177)
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:11:30 so many people said that with my ho 18
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:11:40 ok what should i build
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:12:12 the one thing cold war bomber i hate
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:12:27 wow
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:12:29 please
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:13:10 wait is that a storch but with low wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:13:29 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:13:40 anything but a strategic bomber jeez
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:13:50 i dont want to invest time in a large build
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:14:13 i hate that because its true
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:15:16 ar
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:15:48 what would planes from between ww1 and ww2 be called (whats the time period name then)
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:16:00 thats my favorite period for planes but i never know what to look up
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:16:09 yup...
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:16:14 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:16:33 what no
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:18:27 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:21:56 nice abrams lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:35:40 same... its sad
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 08:35:47 damn the bf 110 nose is painful
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:51:48 yeah way too much
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:04 is that supposed to be an he 177
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:12 wings are a bit large
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:15 for he 177
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:21 and the fuselage is too skinny
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:52:34 and also the engines are small
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:53:01 mine looks great, flies great, does pvp well
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:53:11 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:58:51 ive just got both firework bombs and disconnector bombs
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:58:55 my bomb bay is small
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:59:13 well actually its large what i meant to say was im too lazy to motorlocc more in
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 09:59:33 eh its an old build
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:00:16 *having the bomb bay in a historically accurate place*
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:01:28 how are you so crap at building (no offense but i would gladly enjoy it if you did)
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:42:20 well...
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:42:34 the part underneath the cockpit is large
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:43:34 wow he just went trans in 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:45:18 those ailerons...
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:46:21 wow that
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:47:04 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:48:18 they look pretty shitty
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:48:35 and his ka 50 is just really terrible looking
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:48:54 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:49:58 he has so many dragons
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:53:53 i hate that gjsolos uses cheese grater wings i mean like come on if you are determined to use them at least hide them its easy
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:55:33 someone said something but deleted it
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:55:57 motorlock wing panels in
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:56:08 makes it look like normal wing
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:56:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 10:59:17 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:05:00 motorlocc bombs are kind of useless...
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:05:53 i meant the people who spam tnt in their bombs
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:06:07 im fine with motorloccing for looks but the tnt spam ones dont work well
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:06:42 yeah it looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:07:10 lol yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:10:28 just ground pound them with a heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:10:36 thats cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:13:37 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:41:02 welp i just made a 66 block moth
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 11:41:06 it flies well
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:04:38 honestly i feel the map looked better without the flying island
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:05:12 because there is a nice place underneath it that was fun but now its too dark down there
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:05:32 plus the island is too noisy when down there
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:06:51 that too
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:07:39 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:10:38 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:16:45 i saw that a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:17:20 this is true
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:17:40 but yeah china has a replica of like everything
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:18:05 the c17, the blackhawk, some fighter jets that i cant name rn because im trying to do my (chinese) homework
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:18:27 why are you surprised about the b2
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:29:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:29:46 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:29:57 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:29:59 xinnie
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:30:09 xinnie the pooh
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:45:17 wow that
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:45:35 patrick is that you?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:45:59 best tip; dont build a heli like a heli, build a heli like a vtol plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:46:22 you basically do the same thing but it changes your mindset so much and makes it a lot easier
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 03:52:29 what im saying except vtol jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:14:17 hidden props
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:14:39 how so
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:15:44 dont tilt it
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:15:46 just
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:15:53 do what you do for planes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:16:02 only use the tilt for hovering/going slow
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:16:20 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:16:46 wait what part of working are you having problems with
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:16:50 im very confused now
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:17:32 moving forward is the easiest part
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:17:43 just have internal engines for going forward like a jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:18:02 anti torque is harder to deal with but somehow mine always gets solved without me doing anything lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:18:08 neither am i (well i am but im not the best of the best lol)
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:18:14 ive only got two that work
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:18:27 heli irl have engines for going forward
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:18:44 but sometimes they also have their main rotor that has the ability to move/tilt up and down
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:20:12 ok back to the internal engines part yes irl they do have engines for moving forward. This heli has them right above the cockpit (the intakes)
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:25:22 i have a plane that could verify for aeronautical expert engineer
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:25:28 all i would need are the twenty upvotes which is fine because it looked good
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:25:50 but i hate posting in creations because people spew feedback at me that i never go and fix stuff for
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:28:47 designer is the easiest
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:29:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:29:46 and honestly i thought you were high ranked but used the white name color because some people do
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:29:51 you seem to be good at the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:30:02 its surprisingly hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:30:05 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:30:57 thats fine
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:36:19 used to be me
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:36:25 ive gotten very fast at building
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:36:40 i can now make like 2 good planes every 6 hours
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:36:58 idk why i didnt say 1 every three but ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:37:01 top
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:37:13 i hate the heli with the tail like the bottom one
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:37:31 the helicopters with internal tail props are just ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:37:52 the penetrator
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:38:26 what the hell

thats hot...
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:38:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:39:13 make the penetrator and penetrate some planes with bullets
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:39:30 wot
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:39:40 ok im going to go now and do the thing im trying to do
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:42:05 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:42:31 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:45:30 lol why would you close the ticket
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:47:07 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:47:14 havent checked today
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:50:18 wow
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:51:36 because i hate sharing on creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:51:41 for the reasons stated above
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:51:56 your loss
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:52:07 im trying to do my chinese homework
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:52:14 ill do it later
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:52:45 yes chinese
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:53:33 taiwan is part of china <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:54:18 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:54:29 he works for chine we must kill
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:55:00 nice hidden channel
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:55:14 ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:56:12 i hate when people crap on me about suggestions and stuff when i just say 'yeah' or 'i noticed it' but then never do anything
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:56:31 because once i share a build in creations i never edit them again
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:56:50 plus i suck at photography
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:57:06 and also i build a lot of mini builds now and would hate if people copied them
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:57:16 by mini i mean life sized...
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:57:24 ok you distracted me
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:57:28 i need to do my homework
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:59:38 idk i do tons of motorlocc too but the basic shape is still pretty easy to copy, especially if you know motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 04:59:51 i usually keep it both simple while being realistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:00:33 idk my he 177 is pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:00:50 ive got a crappy camo on it *that was actually used in ww2 on he 177 but its ugly*
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:01:01 i dont have any pics of it rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:01:07 but in creations there is one photo
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:01:19 true
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:01:27 its far away lol and with other people
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:01:30 but ill find it
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:01 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/893360174507638816
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:07 theres two pics
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:14 its got some nice chunky wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:24 and engine fire effect for realism
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:38 and the front gear fold into the wings becayse chunk
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:02:50 (or at least the outer ones do)
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:03:15 i took the picture with two people who had kind of crappy builds though so i got tons of downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:03:35 its the camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:03:40 my camo is very crap
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:03:56 and ive figured out a build will get like 50% more upvotes with a good camo rather than a bad one
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:04:18 mine has lots of details that are impossible to see from that far away
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:04:29 oh also my bomb bay works
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:04:45 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:05:06 i think i tried that i cant remember
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:05:14 i think it gets stuck sometimes but works
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:05:24 some random person told me to put a ladder in
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:05:46 ive got a tiny payload though
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:05:55 only like 10 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:06:13 ive got an interior
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:06:32 fake turrets in the exterior but working ones inside
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:06:50 bro really you use balls
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:07:05 damnit i wish i was done with my homework so i could show my ladder
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:07:17 my ladder is longer and actually is attached to the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:09:16 nice short front gears
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:09:26 mine are like one half of a block too long to be realistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:12:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:13:23 i see why i always thought your fuselage was a bit skinny now
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:13:28 yours is much longer than mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:13:37 i did that to my swordfish
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:13:57 painted like cardboard
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:14:15 theres no cardboard block in pc...
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:16:12 btw as some advice you should make the part underneath the cockpit the ladder part or whatever a bit shorter
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:16:34 
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:16:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:17:19 and your engines are a bit stubby
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:17:28 fake
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:17:49 wait what part
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:17:56 oh i meant
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:18:02 shorter as in tall
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:18:29 yours is kind of like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:18:38 if your shortened it like half a block it would be better
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:19:41 *theres no pic*
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:19:50 oh in creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:21:42 actually its more like this
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:21:54 mine is one block tall
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:22:21 ok idk what you did wrong lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:23:23 i meant your motorlocc how it isnt in the right place if you try fixing it
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:23:37 i would think you would actually need extra motorlocc for making it like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:24:33 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:25:39 weird motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:27:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:27:29 chunky wing motor flaps are cancer
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:27:39 just use props
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:27:41 near the tips
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:27:56 why
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:28:11 you wont see props either
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:28:23 oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:29:04 you really made it more hard for yourself lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:30:03 i did the wing panels in the middle with half blocks locked in
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:30:15 which also gives underside its own camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 05:30:34 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 06:57:44 its funny when shredders chase my fairey swordfish but i just dive into the water like real swordfish (idk why but it swims like a sub well for a plane) and then shredders follow and die

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:28:43 SHOOT THE 109s BOYS
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:28:47 NEVER FEAR THE RAF IS HERE
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:28:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:28:57 well actually mustang...
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:29:14 mustang is very overrated
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:29:31 mm... not really
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:29:37 spittie had a better turning circle
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:29:56 and also spittie has pretty good armaments (im comparing late versions of both)
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:31:23 the spits also had better performance than the mustang overall
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:31:46 *and more spits were built than mustangs im pretty sure*
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:32:03 i feel that the mustang is more popular/overrated than the spitfire although it was worse
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:33:55 but yes i agree both are super overrated compared to other ww2 fighters that were just as capable
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:34:21 *wheres the love for my friends the 109 and the 190*
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:34:57 nope you are doing the ju 288
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 07:35:15 you have no choice

plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:30:13 that thing flies pretty smooth for a broken elevator
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:35:47 exposed motor!!!1!11! <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:36:31 why does nobody make exposed motor bf109
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:39:02 it might make it a bit nicer
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:39:02 for the canopy to spine part just motorlocc down a half wedge or half wedge down on the first half cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:42:53 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:46:16 what
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:47:07 1: say i make shredders
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:47:41 bro shredders are made of paper so weak smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:48:01 i have
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:48:08 the modern ones are even easier
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:49:39 of all the shredder types;
shredder swarms: used to be effective but now they use generic bug swarms that work worse
shredder bugs: fast, hard to hit, no armor so gets one shotted, low damage potential
shredder orbs: sometimes fast, easy to hit, no armor so easy dead death dumb idiot, does damage but always gets annihilated
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:50:01 wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:51:02 the way you kill shredder bugs is make them chase you then kulbit over them and release a rocket salvo
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:51:03 so easy
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:51:46 they used to be really good and smart but the world moved on (and also there are tons of tuts now so the smart shredder people are extinct now its just salty kids)
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:11 rip
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:27 correct
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:53:01 but i sure like builds with variety. that excludes shredders
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:53:42 excuse me
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:53:45 i need more context to answer that question
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:53:55 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:54:11 hot
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:54:49 wow

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:57:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:57:26 except shredders would make it boring
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:57:42 *unless its my zeppelin lol*

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 10:04:48 haha loser
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 10:06:18 or ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 10:06:23 or helium blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 10:19:35 if it gets bad enough they need everything they can get
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 10:19:48 besides you can put their weight to 1 so its just a block

plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:00:46 
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:01:17 especially the german wwi camouflage
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:01:29 they are even more crazy than french or english
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:02:12 imagine dying to this... it would be so shameful
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:02:27 i would be embarrassed to die to a polka dot pink and other colors plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:02:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:02:49 most were in wwi
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:03:19 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:04:50 imagine dying to a fleet of german skittles
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:05:55 i have a couple
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:06:01 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:12:40 thinking of repainting my g.iv from its historical real camouflage (we can ignore that the wings on mine were white, which is also historical) to its white and red dazzle camo
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:27:09 m yes deadchat
creations-chat 2021-12-20 23:30:33 the cylinders are fireworks
creations-chat 2021-12-20 23:34:32 for the black part inside with the grey exterior
ive done it before
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 23:35:26 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:48:46 a normal day in the pcc
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:49:38 our eyes see two dimensions
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:49:55 but our eyes make depth from nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:50:19 if this image would load
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:50:19 
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:51:16 our eyes see 2d but our brain makes it similar to 3d
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:51:39 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:52:07 because our brain translating 2d to 3d get confused
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:52:23 wait how is this pc
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:52:37 hmm let me just
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:54:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:54:35 you see 2d but your brain changes it to something similar to 3d by adding depth
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:55:00 just gonna send this image again
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 19:55:25 lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:05:19 we have stereoscopic vision. Our brain takes the two images from our eyes and takes the placement, shadows, and difference in object placement between the two images to turn the 2d images our eyes give the brain into the 3d images we think we see. You can also do this with one eye but it is technically less advanced in making a 3d image even if it looks the same; your brain will use different things to look for in order to add depth compared to when you are using both your eyes.
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:05:30 goddamn that took like five minutes to load
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:05:36 i sent that a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:05:40 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:05:44 im using grocery store wifi rn
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:06:01 and the grocery store is two houses down and across the street lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:06:30 is my grand speech a copypasta now
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:06:35 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:07:02 our brain makes us perceive an image that is extremely close to 3d
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:07:12 using the 2d images from our eyes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:07:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:08:07 do it
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:08:12 give humans real 3d eyes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:08:20 goddamnit
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:08:33 i should start counting how many times that gets copied and pasted

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:10:39 with bubblechamber eyes
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:11:08 sickle cell disease
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:11:29 it would probably be closer to some sort of gorilla
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 20:12:00 i had a nightmare of a chimpanzee a couple days ago

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:48:10 im terrible at tanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:48:21 especially ww2 tanks they seem to be much harder lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:48:29 because modern mbts are very rectangular
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:49:05 not really
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:49:46 i say opposite thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:50:24 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:50:28 it is quite boxy
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:50:49 the tiger has some challenging angles wdym
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:51:18 besides the tiger is on the boxier side of ww2 tanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:51:20 even the tiger 2 is much more sleek and angled
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:51:42 ive already established that
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:52:58 angles
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:53:19 and the turret?

plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:57:11 boxy
plane-crazy 2021-12-27 10:57:57 idk i just find that most ww2 tanks especially the turrets are much more challenging than mbts

plane-crazy 2022-01-08 22:13:24 back in my day shredders were only used by god smart players instead of 5yr kids
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 22:14:29 back in my day shredders didnt exist and the only pvp was spam cars because nobody knew how to make a plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 22:15:34 back in my days you would run out of save storage after one build because it could only handle like four blocks

general 2022-01-09 00:50:23 desktops are better but laptops are more useable

creations-chat 2022-01-09 00:51:55 agreed

general 2022-01-09 00:52:39 desktop better storage too
general 2022-01-09 00:53:32 if its a crappy desktop vs expensive laptop then laptop wins
general 2022-01-09 00:53:41 but if they are both the same quality then desktop wins for storage

him saying expert designer is easy also him with trash designer rank
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:34:59 whatchu talking about i dont have terrain nor shipwright

all im saying is im just a higher more evolved and intelligent being then him
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:37:23 then do it and if you get an expert (not shipwright nor terrain) in a weeks time then i will apologize
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:39:26 im saying that shipwright and terrain are the easiest to get and designer is just kind of pure luck but also some skill and also you need to time when you post it post it around crappy builds so your decent build you dont care about gets upvotes <:trollface:775024642104229898> 

<@!874912257128136734> is it a deal then?
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:41:34 if i post my good builds i could probably get good stuff but i dont like posting things lol

if you get expert designer with the bote i will accept that
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:43:51 wait also you have easy ranks too you got terrain and the luck based one lol


<@!874912257128136734> terrain and shipwright are notorious for easy criterion

<@!799335319945085018> mod <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:47:31 this is true my ground vehicles suck
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:49:45 honestly if i were you dont get expert shipwright or people will bully you lol its honestly better to have low rank shipwright and high other ranks 
shipwright is the most hated expert

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 08:09:43 i thought they gave you a premium for the nation if you chose it at the beginning
when you open the game for the first time it asks you what nation and playstyle(?) as in ground air or navy and whatever of those you choose you get a premium for said thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 08:27:57 should i make a zeppelin or a submarine
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 08:31:28 my old zep works in water

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:05:50 exposé motorloccé
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:12:04 just dont use so many that are upward
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:20:23 no little things :(
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:57:33 for mini planes its better to use sideways so that the wings can sort of hide them
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 12:42:06 i would say sidelock is more confusing but if you pull it off it looks better in the long run (for mini planes but for others i would say use upward)
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 13:28:44 i 1v1'd firey yesterday
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 13:29:05 we met in a random pvp server

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 23:44:45 top camo is nice but side view camo is quite boring to look at
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 23:50:43 by not adding enough details..?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 23:51:51 what he really needs to do is the engine
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 23:52:54 ah yes the point when you have so many motors that it looks good

help 2022-01-24 02:59:36 someone make the 'invisible plane' (a prototype with clear wings) this is the only reference image i can find but it shows a closeup of the front of one for details i guess and theres a far away one you can take the tail design from
creations-chat 2022-01-24 03:01:56 <@!691825046590718111> i agree with this part but also if you could make a bit more details along the guns they stick out a bit more
and also i only see two guns on yours but the ac130 had a bit more if im not mistaken
general 2022-01-24 03:04:33 he has chilled

also i love the p400 it isnt made enough in this game
creations-chat 2022-01-24 03:22:27 maybe a more toned down version would work
it doesn't need to be advanced it can still be blocky but the vibrantness (shut up i cant think of the correct word) of the colors is what destroys it
creations-chat 2022-01-24 03:24:50 usually i will do that to my builds and they look much better

events-chat 2022-01-30 20:24:33 just motorlocc half wedge ups into it
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:04 no we can only make fard bombers
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:42 sigh how do you make a small bomber anyways lol wheres the fun in that
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:29:11 yes ik
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:29:43 but small bombers are boring
even twin engines are boring unless large like he 177 or something with a large wingspan
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:33:19 actually i almost used that as my example instead of he 177
such a nice plane
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:34:04 its kind of fun sometimes
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:35:01 especially my three fold zeppelin that everyone underestimates then cant hurt because it has blast proof everything and still looks like it doesnt

ok i didnt make it no see why did it do that

events-chat 2022-01-30 20:46:05 all my planes work in pvp and also looks pretty fine using angle locks and such
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:49:35 its so true
i was fighting this guy he was missing a whole wing, had half another, no tail (i shot it off right behind the cockpit) and he still flew perfectly
vulpens b17 looks like vomit but flies well under heavy damage
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:50:39 indeed he did
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:28 reactn't
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:52:41 because they use no skill builds for tuts
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:53:30 they probably either make it on the spot <:trollface:775024642104229898> or they cut out the parts in the video where they look at the build
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:54:38 great now that im thinking of vulpen bomber i really want to make a lancaster (or halifax or lincoln or stirling)
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:56:42 i used to have a stirling but slapped it out of my saved files
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:15 yes i know but i cant see what it lands like because you havent showed lol and also your explanation is not great
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:57:36 i havent played that but i might now
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:03 oh
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:58:57 oh cool
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:59:31 i did that a couple times
one was a biplane double fuselage bomber i posted in creations once (edited though to be more apocalyptic)
events-chat 2022-01-30 20:59:58 thats the only thing close to apocalyptic build that i have in creations
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:16 ah but there are wingless planes
events-chat 2022-01-30 21:00:34

events-chat 2022-01-31 00:16:21 i didnt finish my boat because i forgot about it
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:16:49 rbk make plane event where max speed is 150
and fix time
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:21:59 rbk make a ww1/interwar event where:
There are two teams because yes
one team has airships and the other has small planes
the planes must look like the timeline (advanced biplanes and triplanes, crappy monoplanes)

airships get to have a maximum of one firework and also 8 guns
they can be any size including folding
they cannot go over 100 speed
i guess airships could get explosive blocks for bombing reasons but they have nothing to bomb unless you get lucky like me and a plane flies into your bombs as they are falling and explodes

planes must:
not go over 150
5 guns
can only be between 10x10x10 and cant fold
planes can carry small bombs/1 explosive block to bomb the airships if they want

idk what else to add
creations-chat 2022-01-31 00:34:10 i wish mine were like that

uncomplicated... those were the days
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:41:23 pretty sure they can but host bombers are chad versions
events-chat 2022-01-31 00:42:05 if i were to compare host to player bombers irl it would be like a bristol blenheim (normal) vs an avro lancaster (host)

events-chat 2022-02-06 20:55:10 i got inspired by hyperbits camera they should do a camera bot battle lol
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:00:57 ok so they are all going for blue team to win but from the earlier rounds red did more damage so as of now red team is better
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:05:15 the stream chat argument is mald
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:05:49 i dont even know what that means but they keep calling each other that
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:07:40 red team pro
blue team slow
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:09:05 hyperbit said red won
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:09:39 because blue was terrible red was good
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:11:17 because they glitch out
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:12:27 you forgo(fard) the scoreboard up there
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:13:26 they say red fat and bald but now they are saying they lost to a fat and also bald team<:m_:778994206948589638>
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:14:43 lien't
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:15:37 simply just superior
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:16:08 same
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:16:46 or do this except wwi planes (only biplanes or triplanes) and the host bombers are zeppelins <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:17:27 planes only get one gun
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:17:44 zeppelins get max because turrets are funny
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:05 and also the planes need to be motorlocked so they are weaker
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:36 some do but only one gun it would be quite fun
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:59 and the rotating guns can only rotate 40 degrees in all directions
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:21:10 congratulations for winning i was voting for your team
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:21:38 yeah he definitely did
events-chat 2022-02-07 02:08:35 do the planes not have gear
events-chat 2022-02-07 02:08:56 also where are they if i want to build them
events-chat 2022-02-07 02:09:12 besides just eyeballing the picture
events-chat 2022-02-07 02:17:48 indeed
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:39:18 its all doof
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:40:51 yeah i want to make a tin can
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:41:35 actually no the biplane gets rockets while looking somewhat good as well
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:50:08 is there a tutorial or do we need to eyeball them
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:57:50 didnt it say you cant modify it..?
events-chat 2022-02-08 06:00:45 oh we can

events-chat 2022-02-08 06:20:59 are we able to use the b36 lookin thing or is that a host thing
events-chat 2022-02-08 06:33:12 accidentally made the biplane a monoplane and its much better
events-chat 2022-02-10 02:49:36 you need to eyeball it
events-chat 2022-02-10 02:55:55 theres no motorlocc because banned

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 09:17:18 ecks dee
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 09:19:50 doublewidesuprise_19 is secretly racist

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:04:05 i know
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:04:08 thats what im saying
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:04:25 im not going to fix the wing
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:05:19 elevators too small + wing is shitty + no engines + i angled it wrong in that pic + the goddamn floating motors
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:05:26 but besides that its quite nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:05:32 even has an interior lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:05:50 yeah the fuselage is epic rn
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:06:35 cant fix wing because unable to cope with small plot size
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:06:42 engines are coming soon
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:06:52 and the floating motors are just part of your imagination
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:09:17 oops accidentally had bomb bay open
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:09:30 also its roscale because yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:10:04 historical color palette but from a not very well known arm or squadron or whatever
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:11:09 the interior is also painfully correct
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:11:48 nah nah you gotta blend into the floor for when you crash due to major engine fires because b29 were kind of crap
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:12:51 also its based off of this camo but custom livery
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:14:25 b 18
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:14:39 false
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:14:45 b 18 he didnt mean it

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:17:07 its surprisingly uncommon on this game
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:18:52 pe 8 is insanely ugly wdym
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:20:03 f2222 is pro wdym
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:20:07 hottest plane in the hangar
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:20:42 he 177 is so ugly its just ripoff he 111 except somehow worse
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:20:58 and b17 is just a larger he 111 (early variants)
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:21:20 real
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:21:44 b29 is younger then the b17...
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:21:59 b24 is just a b25 with two extra engines
change my mind
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:22:49 bro the early he 111 were baby b17
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:23:34 f2222 doesnt own all turrets that were used in most interwar planes
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:23:55 still doesnt own it

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:26:19 STUKAS ARE KNOWN AS ONE OF THE WORST PLANES EVER MADE
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:27:50 stukas had crap armor, no good fighting capability, slow, fixed gear = bad, couldnt get shot or it dies, bad turret, crappy, looked bad, sirens had a tendency to rip the landing gear off midflight, german pilots hated it, etc
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:28:16 they never were good
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:29:02 the pilots hated the sirens
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:29:14 in fact
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:29:18 many removed the sirens
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:31:00 lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 10:32:05 lmao vulpen makes his tuts crappy on purpose

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:02:53 forgot the roaches are called b52 as well damn we got some resilient roaches here the size of your hands that also fly at you with their guts hanging out after a slap from a slipper
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:04:24 man why the rotors going so slow
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:05:30 yeah but the humans dont
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:06:33 and im asking why the rotors are slow but the humans arent because it doesnt seem to be a camera frame moment if the humans dont also have 2 fps
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:07:38 i dont get the joke
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:08:50 ive been working on a b29 for so long and its almost done but i scuffed the wings because unable to cope and also i dont want to add the engines (all i need) because im bored and want to start on a new build
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:09:25 because low rank

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:22:51 the b29 bombed my nerves
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 11:23:28 kind of disappointed because the fuselage is so nice but the wings are just eugh and also engines are dumb and i ran out of room to put them in

plane-crazy 2023-05-27 12:38:48 farman <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 12:38:55 ive actually tried that before

plane-crazy 2023-05-27 13:52:27 and then copy and paste it between two = signs
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 13:53:18 =★=

plane-crazy 2023-05-27 13:59:36 thats what i thought
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 13:59:47 but didnt feel like testing
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 12:11:15 anyone know why sometimes wing panels will make lift upside down
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:34:44 prolly a wifi issue my man
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:35:04 trust me i used to have the same problems
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:35:11 though most likely a combination of the two
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 11:14:08 love space engineers
creations-chat 2023-06-07 20:45:50 my man do you not know what overrated is. The F-5 has about maybe 75 entries in the creations area (Half of them are mig 28 too). The F-14 on the other hand has maybe 400 entries.

Also you have no builds at all in creations so we can all assume your best plane is the tutorial one at the beginning of the game <:trollface:775024642104229898> so shut up whitename
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:00:02 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:02:14 hey you know how it be with the slowmode
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:15:07 my f5 had a 4 block long nose (after the canopy)
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:20:41 i mean kinda bad proportions but only because the tail is one block too short my guy
creations-chat 2023-06-07 21:37:46 should i start a new build or fix the "extremely bad proportions" (literally 1 one block short) on my f5 so the whitename cant cry about it anymore
creations-chat 2023-06-08 07:17:35 yo nice
i reworked mine after that whitename said the proportions were a bit off and somehow a tiny little bit like that ended up adding 400 blocks but now it perfectly matches my overlay

edit; sorry i replied to the wrong message meant to reply to <@604636023141433365> but yeah
creations-chat 2023-06-08 07:35:14 you can even add the 20mm in the nose pretty easily just like one piece of pistonlocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:16:53 bro honestly what did i miss in this game
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:17:17 just started playing again after a year and everyone is saying shit about the devs
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:17:33 dont understand why back before my break they were great
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:18:02 true ig i remember when the original release date came an dwent
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:18:19 but honestly i dont understand the hype for pc2 anymore
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:18:31 you cant really make anything much better than it is already on the roblox platform
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:18:50 they should just move on to another platform and engine it would make a much better game
plane-crazy 2023-06-09 07:21:22 now that is a cursed burp gun
