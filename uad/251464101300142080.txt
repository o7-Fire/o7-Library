The Tale of chronitons (251464101300142080)
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 03:47:18 I just had a battle between a Lancaster and a P1000 Ratte
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 03:47:22 I love this game
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:28:55 Hiroshima and Nagasaki were airbursts to minimize the risk to people after the blast; the US intended to land there after
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:29:05 if you hit the ground directly its messier
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:29:26 uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:29:31 no
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:29:40 I joined uh, few minutes before
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:30:55 what is that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:31:05 put all the nukes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:31:11 wait no, make it a nuke
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:31:20 I will fire up my Lancaster mate
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:31:32 uh
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:31:46 I’m not playing right now but I will show you
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:32:38 you just used it noob
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:33:15 joke
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:35:39 BOMBER HARRIS FIRE UP THE LANCASTERS
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:41:05 oh you're in that server too
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:43:54 yes I see it rolling about
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:50:59 NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:51:13 car
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:51:36 thanoscar
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:53:35 ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:53:45 understandable have a nice day
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:54:13 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:54:16 I agree with that
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:54:22 as a fellow human I can relate
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 04:55:16 yes its morse
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:02:59 dont worry it probably ran out of fuel or broke down anyways
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:09:34 Turismo what did you do to my plane
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:09:37 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:10:27 legitimately stole my engines turismo
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:22:58 avert your eyes children
plane-crazy 2019-05-19 05:23:34 yes
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:50:42 wait what are fuel blocks for
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:50:55 yeah but
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:50:57 why would you use it
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:51:03 over no fuel and infinite instead
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:51:07 ah
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:51:38 the red marked waterline on ships will change if its in fresh or saltwater
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:51:53 it could be really salty in that lake who knows
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:52:41 make a KV 2-2-2
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:54:08 I should make a Swordfish to dab on all the Bismarcks people make
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:54:37 making a functional torpedo shouldn’t be too hard, no?
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:06:01 my 1300 part lancaster hasn’t hit max save yet
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:06:05 but what is the max?
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:06:18 I keep adding more
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:07:30 I need to stop building heavy bombers then
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:07:38 hahaha
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:08:08 make your N1 historically accurate too
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:08:10 have it explode
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:08:12 every time
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:08:52 N1 is lame, everyone knows stripes and fins make the Saturn V go faster
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:09:09 flame decals could make it go even faster
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:53:50 what are you doing with motors
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:54:06 I got a prop plane to hit 550, then it spazzed out
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:28:14 Is it even possible to build a scale ANT-20?
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:28:28 I mean 1:1
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:29:18 well assuming human scale for roblox characters
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:29:25 which is what most people do in 1:1 builds
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:30:51 one of the least interesting facts about the ANT-20 is that its the first plane to use both AC and DC
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:31:29 F
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:32:34 what...
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:32:43 why would they have that on
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:33:45 I like their icon
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 18:33:48 just an F
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:40:17 noobs, simply open a 5th dimensional gateway and have negative ping
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:41:08 or you could have so much ping that the value overflows to display a negative number
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:42:08 yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:42:20 literally a step ahead of everyone else
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:42:41 when they said “be ahead of the competition”
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:42:49 I take that at face value
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:44:05 I hijacked the DSN arrays and I get a few hundred terabytes per second
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:44:21 NASA can’t communicate with their satellites but its okay because I can play Roblox slightly faster now
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:45:31 break out the magnifying glass
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:46:07 I have a CRT, its the latest generation of gaming
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:46:10 no not really
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:46:18 I actually use hand puppets in a hollowed out CRT
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:00 its illegal to [REDACTED]
[DATA EXPUNGED]: [REDACTED]
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:05 such a funny story
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:06 hahaha
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:35 a german machine
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:41 let me break out my lancaster
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:48:51 no u
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:49:20 that’s not really south african engineering though
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:49:39 elon didn’t build the whole thing by himself in a cave with a box of scraps
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:49:58 now actual south african engineering is summed up by their weird guns they keep making
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:50:08 it all looks like sci fi props
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:51:09 norman invasion of britain but its reversed
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:52:29 also you don’t want to invade britain
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:52:36 all the tanks would get stuck in roundabouts
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:53:45 actually the real issue would be a defensive line at the thames
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:54:04 if you touched it, you’d probably die in a few hours
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:54:44 e
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:54:50 f
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:55:52 3
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:56:06 what tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:56:23 you will have to be more specific
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:56:33 there’s like, more than 3 tanks out there
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:56:55 not good enough, do a floating P1000 Ratte
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:57:11 a full invasion contained in a single vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:59:15 which leopard
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 21:59:48 imagine the bismarck, but with tracks
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:00:00 someone get on that
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:00:33 I wish we had access to music so I could blast an erika trap remix while driving a tracked bismarck
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:01:54 build the ANT-20
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:02:27 ANT-20, wings are so thicc that it has rooms in them
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:02:30 its propelled by vodka and communism
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:03:40 I saw someone’s ME163, and it was pretty historically accurate
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:03:46 it was loaded with bombs
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:03:55 simulating the tendency to explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:04:02 with its very safe hypergolic fuel
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:04:20 talking about the in-game bombs
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:04:30 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:04:56 we need bigger trapdoors
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:05:13 it works... to an extend
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:05:19 multiple trapdoors
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:05:23 it works
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:05:27 sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:05:42 but I find the cubes get stuck in between the trapdoors
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 22:06:49 why is this server still full

plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:23:12 dear god
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:23:22 your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:23:28 they never stopped to think if they should
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:27:22 the Lancaster stalks its prey
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:27:45 its a plane hanger
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:27:46 get it
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:28:13 see
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:28:15 its a hanger

plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:58:11 This is the battle of chonk
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:58:34 my bomber
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:58:37 is getting hit from both ends
plane-crazy 2019-06-05 23:59:31 top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:20:44 you have an escort
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:23:43 oh good lord... its lined up
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:23:47 we are all going to die
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:24:33 useless red arrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:26:20 that mosquito in the top right of vixo's pic
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:28:38 the Buran's engines are turned on
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:28:41 should we be concerned
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:29:29 its a weird perspective
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:29:57 this
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:30:16 
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:30:34 lmao vixo posted the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:30:36 at the same time
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:31:02 buran is dead
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 00:31:07 🦀

plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:38:28 <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:38:35 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:38:43 delet dis
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:39:41 katze remember that buran carrier thing last night
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:39:51 someone needs to make a spruce goose now
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:39:54 and land it on a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:40:25 no, land a carrier on a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:41:04 reality can be whatever I want
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:41:19 doesn’t stop someone from crashing it into the flight deck anyways
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:41:40 besides all they need to do is capsize and its back in the water
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:42:30 <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:42:36 motor is best engine
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:42:41 don’t @ me
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:43:13 props are better than rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:43:41 I got a dual prop to go 600+
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:43:47 then physics dabbed on it
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:43:51 and the thing spazzed out
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:44:06 jesus
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:44:21 well mine was a dehavilland mosquito
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:44:38 being a historical build it was not performance optimized
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:44:49 I’m sure I could push something much faster
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:45:05 holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 16:45:29 if that spins any faster you will cause an EF5
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 19:02:05 put rockets on cruise ship
plane-crazy 2019-06-06 19:02:22 space cruise ship... not as cool as a space battleship but hey
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 00:36:41 
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 01:09:51 
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 01:15:13 
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 01:15:29 <:ReviveChat:559533624970444811>
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 01:18:28 no u
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:39:55 well the engine is definitely hot
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:40:05 especially if there’s an incline of a few degrees
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:41:23 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:41:30 its in slightly bumpy terrain
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:41:36 hans get ze fire extinguisher
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:41:44 oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:42:26 generally what is the most common historical build that you see in this game that isn’t a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:42:31 but people wanting to build the thing
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:42:52 what is the most common ones
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:43:07 spitfires? p51’s? zeros?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:43:34 y e s
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:43:49 it does look very nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:43:55 it has to be big to support details
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:43:59 no fault of your own
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:44:19 there are easy tanks to build
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:44:22 make an A7V
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:44:26 the german lunchbox
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:45:15 same
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:45:28 whenever I look at a WW2 Italian tank my body starts convulsing
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:45:33 and I start foaming at the mouth
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:45:45 I have to end up looking at a picture of an M4 Sherman to cure it
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:46:42 the FCM 36 was ahead of its time
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:46:49 its a tiny tracked Zumwalt
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:46:58 legitimately, look at the FCM 36 and then the Zumwalt
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:47:25 italian tank destroyers are called M4 Shermans I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:47:35 👌
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:48:17 hello I’m peter griffin here to explain the joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:49:16 it is a very funny turn of the phrase “tank destroyer”, meaning to destroy tanks, and the way the sentence is constructed is to turn “italian tank destroyers” on its head to imply something that destroys italian tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:49:35 an M4 sherman is mentioned as it was used by the US to fight in Italy
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:50:20 you
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:50:32 how are you capable of this
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:50:35 you ruined a joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:50:40 about you ruining a joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:50:46 like this is some 6D chess shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:51:02 I have been more outplayed than the german center by general zhukov
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:52:30 its uncanny
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:52:36 how are you this good at it
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 02:53:34 I couldn’t explain a method behind ruining jokes but you’re like a T1000 reprogrammed to destroy all of them
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:02:45 Can someone please build this Churchill Gun Carrier?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:03:37 I didn't know Churchill Gun Carriers had smokes as well
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:03:53 it is our land
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:04:00 some may get more land than yuo
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:04:06 but they are simply more equal than others
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:04:12 not worry about it komrade
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:04:49 f
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:19 its easy to follow though
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:23 one is small
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:25 one is big
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:29 other is boom boom
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:36 and the other is long range boom boom
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:16:49 the neubaufahrzeug is a meme in of itself

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:19:39 you don’t start with an s
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:19:44 get dabbed on
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:20:12 theory: german tank names are to confuse the allies in radio communication intercepts
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:20:21 “OI, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BULLSHITE”
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:20:25 “what that one mean”
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:20:38 “oh I dunna know, lets go down to the pub with the lads”
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:21:16 I listen to a bass-boosted version
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:21:21 while drinking tea
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:21:24 usually earl grey
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:21:36 thinking of getting a brodie too
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:21:48 maybeeeeeeee

plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:29:35 oh my god the madlad added an engine failure
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:29:43 they said it couldn’t be done
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:30:38 I saw a P1000 Ratte that didn’t have functioning tracks
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:30:45 it used super rockets and pure brute force to move
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 03:30:49 and it *barely* moved
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:09:02 I think I now know what to build next, goddamn that's hot
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:09:15 its them chemtrails
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:09:20 the freaking frogs are turnin gay
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:09:57 jk rowling... I never thought of that
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:09:59 but it makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:10:18 but really look at that Avro Arrow, now that's hot
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:10:24 I mean, look at that red
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:10:38 red makes the plane go faster, everyone knows that
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:10:56 ...yes, I woke up this morning and I thought that is exactly what I want to see
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:14:12 FISH
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:14:14 NEIN NEIN NEIN
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:15:34 the tables turned
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:15:45 either that or the cat really likes the taste of fish throat
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:16:01 wtf why did I write that sentence
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 16:16:03 you did this to me
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:24:36 building an avro arrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:24:41 someone is insisting its a concorde
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:24:42 I
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:24:50 I am going to have a stroke
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:25:30 aaaaap
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:26:27 I was going to go to school to do exam stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:26:32 but the flu is like
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:26:35 im already behind you
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 18:26:59 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:01:27 building the Avro Arrow as slightly competitive in PVP is one giant pain in the arse
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:01:34 the wings are so far back
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:02:07 there aren’t even any other lifting surfaces... its all in the delta wings
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:03:07 it does look really cool as a benefit though
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:03:22 I tried
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:03:32 my build isn’t large enough for systems like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:03:43 I need engines all through the fuselage to make it fast
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:03:53 the large deltas are bringing a lot of drag and weight
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:04:21 yeah I tried that
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:04:28 it wasn’t enough weight to offset it
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:04:34 without making the fuselage larger
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:04:46 that’s not the issue
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:04:50 its already too front heavy
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:05:05 wait
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:05:06 what
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:05:14 that is a bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:05:46 when can I drop Tim Hortons on enemies
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:05:52 otherwise its not a real Canadian plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:06:13 carpet bombing people with timbits and using double doubles as napalm
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:06:28 I’m sure that’s what the Avro Arrow would be armed with IRL if it actually went into combat
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 21:55:45 F
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:43:24 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:43:29 something seems wrong there
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:43:40 ah, I’ve got it, its French
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:43:57 wait... no, there’s a bigger issue I’m not quite picking up on
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:48:33 that poor hull mounted howitzer
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:48:52 imagine
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:49:00 having no horizontal gimbal
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:49:23 brought to you by the ball mount gang
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 22:50:25 nice
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:02:04 yes it is a B1
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:02:34 from the armour I see on the turret... it looks like an up-armoured tank used by the Germans
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:04:00 very useful howitzer
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:04:15 to fire it I’m guessing the person in there would have to tell the driver what to point at?
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:23:49 I build an Avro Arrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:23:55 someone calls it a mitsubishi
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:23:59 someone calls it a mirage III
plane-crazy 2019-06-07 23:24:02 I want to die
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:07:30 hey now, its not angled
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:07:31 so
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:09:59 F
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:10:06 F’s in the chat folks
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:10:21 oi
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:22 Avro CF-105 Arrow
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:26 pew pew
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:27 something
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:30 got cancelled, shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:41 yeah I know the nose
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:44 it annoys me too
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:11:52 but I don't have the parts on such a small scale to make it work
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:42:15 chat filter still works right?!?!
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:42:23 its perfectly fine to censor normal conversation
plane-crazy 2019-06-08 01:42:36 with barely context based, rigid lists
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:44:24 I was going to build something for Canada Day but I already made an Avro Arrow
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:45:00 what else is there that Canada made? some twigs and a maple leaf that drops double-doubles from tim hortons on the enemy?
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:45:25 y e s
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:45:43 take the entire country off the planet and use it as a plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:46:12 I already made a lancaster
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:46:13 reeee
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:46:35 oh that sounds good
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:47:05 eh
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:47:34 not really playing the game at the moment
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 16:47:39 but I am thinking of what to make
creations-chat 2019-07-12 00:39:06 A barely flyable Danube Runabout
creations-chat 2019-07-12 00:47:27 ster tracks
creations-chat 2019-07-12 00:47:54 this thing flies so horribly
creations-chat 2019-07-12 00:48:11 I don't know how to make it less, uh, suck, yeah, less suck
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 02:45:26 I built an Avro Arrow and crammed it with engines, used low density ballast, thing barely got past 500
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 02:45:44 I build a Danube Runabout, essentially a flying brick with the flying part as an afterthought
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 02:45:53 immediately exceeds 600 on first test flight
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 02:46:26 hot
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 21:53:51 oh god why
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 21:54:02 say aeiou
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 21:54:09 aeiou
plane-crazy 2019-07-12 21:54:52 yep and that's a discord feature I'm disabling
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:38:06 How can I go faster?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:39:36 uh
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:39:37 that's neat
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:39:56 well I think having the PVP enabled might not be a great choice
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:40:06 because the PVP servers are only for people looking to fight other creations
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:40:30 oh fair enough then
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:40:51 I don't know about the speed indicator
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:40:57 maybe a lil small?
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:45:03 I just mentioned it being small
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:45:12 because I am messing around with speeds well past 1000 at the moment
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:45:41 and it doesn't really display very well
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 05:59:54 here's what you put in that empty space: a better speed indicator
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 06:01:34 I've been toying around and this is my new top speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 06:02:16 Its so stable it only spazzed out when I hit something on accident
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 18:48:57 I have the need for speed, I got a dual prop to exceed 2500, how do I go faster?
creations-chat 2019-07-16 23:59:46 Dornier Do 217 deploying its HS 293 missile
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:04:08 Top 10 photos taken seconds before disaster
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:13:05 rockets are way too slow, dogfighting at high speed turns into 'who can get in front of the other and throw a missile backwards'
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:13:16 and usually its nobody because they're both spazzing around
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:13:27 and nobody can get in front of the other, perfectly align to get a single rocket hit
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:13:37 and that's if the 'guiding' doesn't decide to yeet itself away from the enemy plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:14:59 that would fix a lot
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:15:20 I've pretty much given up on rockets and high-speed dogfighting as a whole
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:15:30 if I want to blow something up I use a camera guided missile
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:16:08 they are guided
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:16:18 so they are missiles... but their guiding is so bad it might as well not be honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:17:27 I ended up making what I call 'Amazon Prime'
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:17:39 its a dual prop that flies at 1600 to completely avoid dogfighting alltogether
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:17:44 and it has 4 guided missiles
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:18:05 it delivers packages at a very fast rate
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:19:07 the missiles themselves? honestly no idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:20:24 I think it might be similar to a standard rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 00:20:50 it only uses some wings and a magnet drive to function
creations-chat 2019-07-17 00:57:17 Lawnmower: I sleep
Flying lawnmower: REAL SHIT
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 02:47:26 put it in american flag colours, really make it over the top
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 02:47:32 build a giant bald eagle on the top
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 02:49:44 y e s
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 02:50:04 and get rid of the bombs, have a rich 80's interior like trump's private jet
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 02:50:27 then in place of the bombs you put drones on the wings to detach and dronestrike those enemies of freedom on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:06:38 History Channel at 2 AM:
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:12:55 Why the hell?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:13:01 what's with that username
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:14:10 How does that look cooler to anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:14:30 All that would *usually* tell me is that their preferred username wasn't available
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:14:35 but this is Discord so what gives
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:14:55 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:15:01 so that's on purpose
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:15:36 It could be a self-aware joke thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:15:56 like when people make up xX_420noobpwnr69_Xx and similar usernames
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:31:08 50th of Apollo 11, probably
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:31:30 I'd bet a fair amount of money on it being around the 50th
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:33:03 The aliens are gonna get scammed
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:33:14 that's why we need to break them out of Area 51 to warn their species
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:33:50 Its only a single site
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:34:18 Everyone should know by now, the main site and headquarters of the SCP Foundation is in Florida
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:34:37 Look at all the weird things that happen there, the guy who threatened to destroy everyone with an army of turtles, etc.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:34:47 Obvious minor containment breaches all over Florida
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:36:02 Area 51 is where they keep a good rocket guidance script for Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:36:06 we need to break in sooner than Sept. 20th
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:36:50 No, silly, they're moving it all to Area 50
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 03:40:01 Successful deployment of Amazon drone delivery

plane-crazy 2019-07-17 06:17:45 My missiles are dropping out of the sky like they don’t even have wings, what’s going on?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 06:18:01 is this some kind of lag thing?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:02:36 NO WAY, a military having underground bunkers to store their equipment?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:03:09 Or whatever they wish to keep from being destroyed / stolen.
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:03:43 SMH, they keep the aliens at the base on Venus
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:04:11 They keep the aliens at the base inside Sagittarius A*
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:04:23 Suggest you go look in there first
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:04:58 Okay, and?
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:05:22 Middle of nowhere, got it
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:05:33 Yeah, that's what I just said
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:06:39 S4 is probably an ammunition storage
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:07:01 The kind of thing you don't put right next to / underneath your military base
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:07:11 so of course its seperated by a mountain
plane-crazy 2019-07-17 19:13:11 LMAO if you select google street view around Groom Lake it turns the person icon into a flying saucer
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:51:47 I was finishing up the wings of my B-25 when
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:52:25 but then I'd have to fold
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:52:30 1 BLOCK, that's all I needed
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:53:31 The M231 is great but when do they add the Bradley that comes with it
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:53:52 should be an attachment for the M231 honestly
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:54:31 "I tried to do what you did and I couldn't THEREFORE HXER I WIL BAN U MY DAD IS BULDERMAN"
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:55:04 that glitch has been around for a while though, real talk
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:56:24 https://youtu.be/Sr_i_nEmNy0 here's that PF burst glitch
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:56:30 its been known for a while now
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 17:57:21 relevant video
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 18:32:44 If only there was a 12.7x99mm in PF that was automatic, you could do that glitch and make people think the world was coming to an end

plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:12:53 that’s why you use props
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:13:03 prop gang unite
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:13:29 lagnet drive
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:13:31 no thanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:14:43 propellers are faster than magnets because they don’t end up slowing your physics and frame rate
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:15:21 I got a propeller to go 2500 with no physics or framerate reductions
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:15:34 it flies fairly stable
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:15:41 until it doesn’t want to
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:16:17 I am trying to get a stable 3000 speed prop
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:16:25 the solution might be larger propellers
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:17:29 what the fuck you usin, carrier pigeons?
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:17:58 yessssssss
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:18:54 not great not terrible
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:19:37 you try to load a single image
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:19:47 your service provider: hippity hoppity
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:25:16 I was playing and asked a friend what medium sized bomber I should build
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:25:22 they immediately told me B36
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:25:29 thanks I’m cured
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:26:14 I built a B25 already
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:26:24 I was legit standing in front of my B25
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:26:26 when they told me
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:26:33 uh hang on I don’t have it on me atm
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:30:09 here was that B25 maxi
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:30:36 damn boi she thicc
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 02:33:03 hot
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:26:45 E
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:27:06 I once tried to drive a propeller by using rockets
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:27:13 and then it ended up looking like a swastika
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:27:21 but more importantly it didn’t work well
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:27:43 <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:13 has anyone actually made a decent 1:1 scale B-36 yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:30 or are people too scared of the B-36’s power
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:49 therapist: B-36 doesn’t fly any more, it can’t hurt you
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:28:58 B-36 made in roblox:
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:29:24 idk how to make motors look good with the wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:29:31 so I have held off on making big bois
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:29:51 I actually might make the ANT-20 though, its thicc enough to hide the motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:29:58 its thicc enough to have rooms in its wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:02 its just thicc basically
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:43 I might end up making this
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:45 damn boi, she THICC
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:52 that one guy on the wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:30:57 idk what he be doin
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:31:25 that landing gear cover is massive
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:31:44 the nose is very aerodyamic as you can see
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:31:46 its uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:31:49 flat
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:32:11 we should get a half triangle wedge corner
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:32:26 we need more half blocks in general
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:32:44 check which acc is dummy thicc
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:32:49 that one contains the B-36 for sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:33:46 the ANT-20 was the first plane to have DC and AC power
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:33:58 that is the least interesting thing about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:34:58 only 2 were built
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:35:02 both crashed
plane-crazy 2019-08-08 16:35:16 which is really strange I see nothing wrong with the design

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:30:30 I was so close to finishing my beaufighter and then power went out, now there’s rumbling and an anvil shaped cloud approaching
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:30:31 fuck
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:31:07 its pretty ok in combat too
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:31:10 got it to fly at 600
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:31:21 F
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:32:13 we’re not ignoring you
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:32:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:33:04 you get ranks by creations right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:34:34 for aeronautical engineer how are rule 2 and 3 even enforced
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:45:27 dear god WHAT DID YOU DO
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:46:05 wait, maybe they missed a 0 and they’re actually 100
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:46:11 big if true
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:46:20 yes

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:47:39 except for the two times
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:47:49 I knew it he’s actually 100
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:47:54 oh he’s 101
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:48:08 how does that make sense
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:48:56 bad meme
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:50:08 no u (yesn’t)
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:50:26 what about something to do with bombers
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:50:39 I have like
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:50:42 3 bombers
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:50:45 all from WW2
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:52:26 probably?

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:53:51 sturmpanzer II
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:54:11 lmao that’s one sad tiger
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:54:30 with the sturmtiger it has an extra escape hatch
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:54:35 extremely convenient
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:54:50 exit out the barrel to assert dominance on the allies
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 19:55:02 and then break your transmission

creations-chat 2019-08-09 20:33:04 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:38 I build pretty smol stuff so I don’t hit storage limits
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:46 I stay around 300-1000 blocks per
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:49:59 do medium bombers and twin engine fighters
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:50:27 so far its the B-25J, Do 217 and Beaufighter
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:29 You know people make replicas because they want to have that specific vehicle right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:49 its not because of a lack of imagination that causes them to make historical builds
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:03 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:44 I make up some of my planes and spaceships, but I also do WW2 twin engine planes that fit at 1:1 because I want to fly them
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:29 replicas are harder to build
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:31 change my mind
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:24 Superidra I don’t have an issue with creations coming out of imagination and I also like replicas
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:48 its like you think its either I like one or the other, if something is well made I think its good
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:34 replicas end up drastically different anyways because it is difficult at times to emulate something with blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:51 and is there a problem with that
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:58 people build what they want to build
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:27 even now people who are good end up knowing each other
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:05:44 I have noticed a circle of people who are friended who are good at building
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:06:30 its always good to learn different building techniques
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:06:43 I check what people are doing from time to time
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:07:29 is superidra actually a boomer
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:16:56 electrified handcuffs?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:17:17 I wasn’t being that serious
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:17:48 hacker pepper sprayed me with a G17 eighteen times when I opened my door
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:18:16 hot
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:18:38 a hacker punched me with a baton
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:18:57 oh yes he does speak english
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:13 he’s talking about going to a farm as a commando and gunning people down with a phaser
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:17 see its english
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:20 if you try hard enough
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:41 its a ray gun phaser
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:47 that he uses at a farm
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:19:54 something about a commando
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:20:12 its definitely english if you forget what english looks like
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:20:36 hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:21:31 my beaufighter is turning into something hella op in pvp and I love it
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:21:43 it goes 400 with only its props
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:21:53 but I can yeet with magnets and go 700
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:22:54 I want a new plane to make... twin engine prop, WW2 era and fits within the bounding box at a 1:1 scale
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:22:59 any ideas
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:14 mosquito sounds fun
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:16 lmao 777
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:22 well thanks I’m cured
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:23:54 we all remember when a single 777 of RAF 643 Squadron destroyed 30 Tiger II’s during the Battle of the Bulge
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:24:20 yep
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:24:43 it killed thousands of enemies by simply succing them into its high bypass tube of doom
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:25:01 they could shoot it down though
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:25:04 just would be
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:25:07 really difficult
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:25:37 if it got to high altitude at cruising speed it would be invulnerable though
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:25:52 great reconnaissance asset for sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:26:15 low fuel burn but this is the allies so who cares about having enough oil
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:26:29 I mean they got sugar daddy murica to give them a black shower
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:27:02 wait
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:27:04 *what*
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:27:17 *W H A T*
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:27:57 what kind of substances were they using in that writing room
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:28:01 and where do I get them
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:28:28 no no
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:28:36 I mean what were they smoking when they wrote that
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:28:45 fair enough
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:29:00 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:29:06 I just bruhed all over myself
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:29:07 oh god
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:29:12 sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:29:12 uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:45:05 E
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:19:57 nobody had to see this, you know
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:20:02 it was free to not post this
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:20:07 but ya did it anyways
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:23:25 YOU'VE GOT A HOLE IN YOUR RIGHT WING

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:25:39 oh yes cornwall the biggest of them all
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:26:25 I am waiting for the mosquitoes to die here
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:26:37 eventually in the winter the temps fall to -20/30
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:26:46 so that’s a definite oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:27:06 spiders are cool unless you’re in australia or some other place that is basically the nether
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:27:54 highs in the summer here are 30C and lows are -30C in the winter
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:27:56 perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:28:00 as all things should be
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:29:58 high speed air combat sucks so immensely
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:30:05 the reward for making a fast plane is uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:30:08 overshooting everything
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:30:26 and if you fight another fast plane you end up dancing around trying to get in front of the other
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:30:42 I once got heatstroked in bed for 2 hours
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:30:44 fun times

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:23:34 nice miranda
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:23:56 why you using a miranda though that’s basically asking to be killed
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:24:02 its the redshirt of starships
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:25:42 I’m guessing its a backup?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:26:10 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:27:31 nobody will know what that image means
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:27:34 that’s my guess
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:29:21 I’m surprised by how most people with planes in plane crazy can actually fly them
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:29:50 Flightline is 90% disaster among its playerbase
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:30:12 its people taking off from taxiways and stalling out in their 747 at 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:30:15 I know its easy
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:30:28 but I see stuff like that in Flightline constantly
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:31:20 nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:32:54 its not even flying realistically
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:33:01 in flightline half of them can’t get into the air

plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:28:19 yamato is thicc
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:28:53 somehow it looks even more useless in that photo than it was in real life
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:28:55 that's impressive
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:29:18 yamato uh, maybe hit a destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:29:20 and then die
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:29:26 from a whole bunch of planes
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:30:10 frankly any amount of AA would not matter
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:30:14 it got swarmed by hundreds of planes
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:30:42 the yamato was useless throughout its entire service
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:30:53 it took resources by being fueled and repaired
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:30:56 and then died
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:31:11 yeah it was powerful and also did absolutely nothing for the IJN
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:31:35 it was a net loss with its fuel consumption and repair time
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:32:06 japan realized it was lacking resources a long time before, that's why they started the east asian co-pros blah blah blah sphere
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:00 they were doomed the moment pearl harbour happened
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:14 those ships were sunk and a lot of US sailors died
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:18 but most were recovered
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:34 and it forced the US to find out that their aircraft carriers are the new meta of the war
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:39 so they ended up spamming escort carriers
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:45 that too
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:33:50 their carriers were not there
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:34:52 the yamato fired its guns at enemy ships only once at leyte gulf
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:34:57 where the japanese navy got absolutely clapped
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:35:02 and it managed to run away
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:35:23 its pretty hard to say whether it actually sunk any US ships or even hit some
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:36:11 oh and its sister ship the musashi died pretty hard in the same battle
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:37:00 the USS California was recovered
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:37:14 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:37:14 the luftwaffe?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:37:20 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 06:37:20 the kriegsmarine?
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 17:51:56 YOU'VE GOT A HOLE IN YOUR LEFT WING
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:04:29 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:05:36 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-11 18:06:44 bruh
general 2019-08-11 18:08:06 interplanetary long boi
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 02:32:12 There was a boat in the water that noticed my Beaufighter flying towards it low above the water, they said “what is that”

Then they saw a long grey object detach from the bottom which began to come closer and closer

they said “oh no”
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 04:46:30 My work against the Kriegsmarine is done
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 05:02:58 The moment they saw my plane lining up for an attack, and the moment they saw the torpedo deploy towards their ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 06:15:40 I am thelegend27
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 07:53:34 
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 07:56:41 
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 07:57:25 that's true
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 21:50:00 It looks like nobody has built a scale Short Stirling and posted it here... this looks like a job for me
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 21:51:41 did somebody say
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 21:51:42 OIL
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 21:52:07 free GE90?
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 21:52:14 I’d take a free GE90
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 22:14:55 yeah, its big screen time
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 22:15:52 real gamers who know we live in a society use a 420:69 aspect ratio
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 22:17:38 I haven’t slept in 36 hours how is everyone else doing
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 13:05:45 question, if I was folding the wings of a plane and I wanted it to look good after how would I go about it
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 13:06:06 a plane that looks like this
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 15:04:48 short stirling is becoming chonk
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 15:06:42 funny
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 15:08:39 short stirling is not short
plane-crazy 2019-08-13 15:08:43 false advertisement

plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:10:38 nice
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:10:53 so if I qualify for a rank who do I notify
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:13:30 who do I ask to get the rank now
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:14:29 proof of no helium?
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:14:53 so what proofs that
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:16:15 its in <#384025409945337856> what else do I have to provide
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:20:11 you mean cutting it in half
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:20:40 I didn’t see that in the rank channel but uh
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:20:41 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 01:23:54 ok so I cut it in half
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:15:44 alright so after making the Short Stirling I want to make another relatively obscure heavy bomber, which should I build? And don’t say B-36
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:15:59 inb4 someone says B-36
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:16:24 oh that B-58 looks interesting
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:17:06 I mean your profile picture here is a dab so I wouldn’t say the cringe ends
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:18:34 This is so sad, can we unify the European Union into a new Roman Empire?
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:19:13 This is so sad can we bring back the Kalmar Union?
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:19:24 actually seriously can we bring back the Kalmar Union
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:19:28 that was lit
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:19:47 also bring back the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:20:31 hmmm maybe I should build a 1:1 scale Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in PC
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 12:22:44 Copenhagen

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 17:58:33 Update has performance improvements? That’s pretty hot, maybe now I can get 20 FPS instead of 17 FPS when flying my 1:1 Short Stirling
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:06:50 So how effective are these performance improvements
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:07:17 I’m not expecting miracles but is it noticable?
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 18:07:52 Thanks for making that response

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:51:23 base price of 1 mil for 200kg
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:52:25 The HDEV was a test of cameras used for a long duration in low earth orbit
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:52:48 the entire thing was an experiment and they are evaluating its performance
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:53:35 I mean they say right there "has reached End of Life"
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:58:27 the resolution is so shit for ground imaging I can't even begin
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 20:59:05 wide angle and streamed from actual space, captured at 1080p and worn down by years of exposure to space
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 21:01:04 you didn't see graphite
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 03:38:58 my bombers will now be 99% defenceless as compared to being 100% before
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 03:39:35 because when a single rocket destroys the entire tail what is even the point

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:03:12 nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:03:37 this update gives my bomber builds at least a single chance to defend themselves
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:03:43 still pretty useless in the face of rockets
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 01:05:16 someone built the twin towers in a game I was in

plane-crazy 2019-09-19 00:30:19 YOU'VE GOT A HOLE IN YOUR LEFT WING
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 00:37:11 CREEPER
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:18:17 who needs updates when you can have mods
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:19:24 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:19:36 then you're sadly missing out on stuff like this
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:10 I am running a mod that made me prepare full life support and redundant systems, pack supplies, plan a course around radiation belts
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:13 stuff like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:31 that exists
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:34 its called realism overhaul
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:54 well yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:20:55 that's what it does
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:08 i believe there's also a variant which makes it earth, but 10x smaller (so same size as kerbin)
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:21 there's also a mod that makes kerbin 10x smaller
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:25 so 100x smaller than earth
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:34 yeah that exists too
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:39 to be like
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:42 same size as earth
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:21:56 not sure but mods add other star systems
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:22:14 which can only be reasonably reached by using more mods
plane-crazy 2019-09-19 17:23:00 dear god
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 00:22:45 so uh sonic 2 is looking pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 00:25:22 c o i l
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:09:43 I have a Do 217 with two HS 293’s and I found out that the Fritz-X takes up an entirely different mounting point
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:09:44 ohohohoho
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:09:57 four guided bombs
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:10:37 Motor 2 AA guns have yeed their last haw
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:12:05 Its already been made more efficient
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:12:24 we could use some more half parts so builds can be more efficient though
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:13:12 I mean if we had the half wedge but 4 long that would cut like 100 blocks off some of my planes
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:10 the hangars could be extended backwards along with the map
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:17 but I’m not sure how that would actually work
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:48 that’s what I was afraid of
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:16:16 how bout proper hinges then
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:16:20 for seamless fold
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:16:43 if we gotta fold anyways might as well be able to do it properly
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:47 where are the 1x1 propellers
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:52 WHERE ARE THEY
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:28 I guess the area 51 raid is today, I hope they make it out of there with increased save file space and smaller props
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:51 you can’t cancel destiny
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:19:02 we will see them aliens
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:19:12 if it takes all the naruto runners in the world
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:20:12 they have hinges in area 52
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:50:25 nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:51:16 yeah uh the V2 is cool I guess but what about the HS 293 and Fritz-X
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:52:39 the HS 293 isn’t technically a glide bomb
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:52:48 it has propulsion for something like 10 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:53:35 it does glide most of the way though
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:54:14 could have more rocket to give it more range but then it would be too THICC for its mounting point on bombers
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:55:04 he gotta go fast
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:56:39 wow that’s so deep
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:56:43 that’s literally me
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:57:25 well it wasn’t the worst considering how new the tech was
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:57:34 but yeah you kinda need air superiority
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:57:42 to fly in a straight line over enemy convoys
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:57:59 while deploying a missile with a giant “shoot me” flare and rocket
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:58:36 but I don’t know if I would call the HS 293 completely ineffective
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:58:44 the thing did sink and damage quite a few ships
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:59:29 yes none of the wunderwaffe could have changed the war that was doomed from the start
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 14:00:19 but considering it actually worked and sunk quite a few ships with the limited air superiority they had
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 14:00:34 better than the Maus I guess?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 14:03:17 the HS 293 and Fritz-X kinda suffered from issues after the Allies figured out how to jam it
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 14:03:23 by telling it to turn right
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 17:30:51 more caves so ground vehicles can avoid planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 18:10:03 Recovered footage of HS 293 destroying Allied cargo vessel [1944; colourised, sound added]

plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:09:36 two nukes was either too many or not enough
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:10:38 what
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:10:40 the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:10:53 okay can WW3 start already
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:11:11 I will go to the highest priority city in that case
plane-crazy 2019-10-02 22:11:14 get this over with
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:34:36 TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:34:56 but what does that mean
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:35:00 I hope it doesn't break my builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:35:22 although to be fair I fail to see how magnets could be broken more than they are already
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:35:24 so its probably ok
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:36:30 I save every time I finish a little modification
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 21:36:57 wait its already back? seriously?
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:16:34 Magnet engines still work, in fact I think they work better now
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:16:45 I noticed at least 100 extra speed on my magnet engines
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:16:53 and they have less performance hit
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:17:01 yep
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:17:03 you can do more
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:17:16 and they have a superstrength setting now but turning that on decreased my speed so I don't know what to say about that one
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:17:33 I don't know what it even does at the moment
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:18:25 oh I noticed something
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:18:33 turning on superstrength did decrease my plane's speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:18:40 but its "startup" time was faster
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:18:57 the moment of no frame rate when the magnet engine is turning on
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:19:03 with superstrength that was faster
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:19:16 which is interesting, this is stuff I'm gonna mess around with a lot
plane-crazy 2019-10-05 02:03:01 
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 16:08:42 hydrogen alpha?
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 16:09:11 I’m not really into solar imaging but you do you I guess
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 21:41:03 the new cutters are that good?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 21:43:14 Time to use this in my guided missiles
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:38:40 im going to build a Mistel with my FW 190 and then delete the fighter in a separate save and modify to make a normal JU 88
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:38:56 >when you make a modified bomber and then modify it to make a normal bomber
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:39:02 😎
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:40:43 ships are why I have a plane with a torpedo
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:40:58 and a plane with either the Fritz-X or HS 293
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:41:31 Laughs in HS 293
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:41:38 cries in jammed radar signals

plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:47:31 SHIP PASS DENIED
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:48:40 Kriegsmarine rudder destroyed
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:49:04 with what i did to that german ship
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:49:08 I think not
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:50:03 There’s killed and then there’s the several layers of hell I kicked it into
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:50:10 I hit it with probably 5 torpedoes
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:50:19 at each chunk that broke off
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:50:48 yikes
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:51:02 nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:51:24 Building a Mistel is gonna be the reverse Uno card in my save files
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:51:35 “hahahah look at that slow bomber I will shoot it down’
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:51:41 “oh god why is it”
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:51:43 “oh no”
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:53:59 Pokey JU 88
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:54:06 also yes bigger map would be nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:54:37 We out here making 1000+ speed planes and the current map is like nothing
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:55:58 The performance hit would be negligible considering its all voxels right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:56:18 Worst case scenario someone turns down render, yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:56:41 Yes the voxel terrain does perform well in contrast to the rest of the game
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:57:11 Has there been any word on why map size is still smol
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:58:24 Hell at least not have the area behind the spawn be a giant cliff into nothingness
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:58:46 With what
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 21:59:50 yikes
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:01:16 Down wings when?
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:01:37 Centered wings can’t be placed in ways I need them to be
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:01:45 and it allows for a dual tone paint job
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:03:39 I have to use decouplers to get a convincingly scaled two tone wing
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:03:47 and even then there’s no lift provided
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:03:59 its pretty ghetto and also increases part count so much
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 22:29:44 yeah it doesn’t look worth copying but ok I guess only above the waterline matters
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:45:41 oh god don’t remind me of all the stupid shit that welds together in this game
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:45:44 aaaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:46:16 triangle wedgeblocks are a disappointment because of that
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:46:46 also where are long versions of the 2 and 3x wedges and the half wedge
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:47:02 this is plane crazy, right? as in, planes? people make fuselages
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:47:19 that’s
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:47:23 not what I’m saying
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:47:32 those but  w i d e
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:48:21 ok gamer
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:49:18 I have been destroyed with facts and knowledge
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:49:39 also half wedge down or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:49:44 could use long version
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:51:12 I go for planes that people have not made
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:51:24 on this server
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:51:25 at least
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:51:59 Maybe someone is flying around with a 1:1 short stirling but if I see it in game I will delete everything and go into hiding
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:52:10 failed, I would have
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:52:14 into exile, I must go
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:53:37 although a lot of people have made the B-25 and I made one too
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:53:38 but uh
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:53:39 shut
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:55:31 lol ares rockets
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:56:12 F to the Ares, constellation, shuttle derived launch vehicles in general, basically everything tried between shuttle and senate launch system
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:56:17 especially the X 33
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:56:24 that didn’t deserve what it got
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:57:56 idk someone might misinterpret it
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:58:17 like you mean in game or here
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:58:27 oh in game
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:59:13 I’m not sure how moderation of things works in game
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:59:25 I know we have reports
plane-crazy 2019-10-19 23:59:39 but roblox in general?
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:00:16 well don’t you have a vibe pass on your person at all times anyways
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:01:55 or use a discord image link
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:02:00 what
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:02:17 is there more to this than  e n g i n e s
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:02:32 F
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:02:43 you already did

plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:03:18 
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:03:32 ha take that mods
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:03:36 they be asleep
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:03:52 while I assert dominance by eating spam
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:04:10 chopped pork and ham
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:04:13 that kind of spam
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:01 so people get banned for making parachute bombs, what if I put a parachute on a bomb
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:04 double ban
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:10 double negative and therefore no ban
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:15 the universe breaks apart?
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:36 useful building blocks get added?
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:05:42 lmao no that wouldn’t happen
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:06:02 that be some 0 IQ
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:06:12 tell them to add max range magnets so their game gets crashed
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:06:14 would be fun
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:06:46 Vista is as reliable as <:Motor:559531201237352451>
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:07:17 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:07:59 so what happens if you add cutter blocks around your bombs?
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:08:08 do they spread out and cut things
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:08:27 *he got a very evil idea, a very evil idea indeed*
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:09:05 Im making a Mistel which is a JU 88 but loaded with bombs so we gonna be cutter block spam plus TNT here today
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:09:41 flying a bomber with hundreds of cutter blocks and explosives at someone’s general direction
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:09:46 because screw them
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:09:56 so many wheels gonna be falling off cars in pvp

plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:13:27 like walking out on the street, finding someone and telling them “you are henceforth muted on the official plane crazy discord server”
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:13:43 yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:14:49 “you, the other person in this conversation, will be muted; that is, to be silenced, when attempting to engage in discourse on the official Discord server for the Roblox game of Plane Crazy.”
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:15:01 <:ElonWoke:589674854798589962>
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:16:19 “I sayeth to the accused of transgressions upon our rules within the server for Plane Crazy, the game on Roblox, a multiplayer game platform, that you will not be given the opportunity to send messages within its various channels.”

plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:40:57 also I am in the eastern timezone rn
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:05 EAST TIMEZONE GANG
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:09 rise up
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:30 I’m normally in the atlantic time zone actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:32 so uh
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:33 dab
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:52 we can see 1 hour in the future ahead of those eastern normies
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:41:57 we have ascended
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:42:38 AST > EST
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:42:40 get dabbed
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:42:45 rest of north america
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:43:46 1 h ahead of est
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:43:48 because boi
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:44:01 BOI
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:46:01 my graphics card is an enigma machine, its completely impossible to understand what is on my screen but at least the british can’t figure out what degeneracy I am watching
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:46:16 no british person, like, say someone named alan turing could figure this out
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:46:20 so im safe from spying
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:08 its from some russian guy with a giant
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:10 gun
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:20 sorry I should be more specific that’s all of them
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:35 he’s a russian guy with a giant gun who is wearing a red shirt
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:36 there
plane-crazy 2019-10-20 00:47:40 that’s more specific
creations-chat 2019-10-21 22:27:56 Fw 190 A-8
creations-chat 2019-10-21 22:28:06 
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:03 so there is improved performance once again
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:09 noticeable difference?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:53:16 nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:54:22 Oh, its the colour of the personal parachute
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:54:29 Is it also the colour of the parachute block?
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 18:55:21 can we get low wing parts
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 01:10:07 so uhm
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 01:10:10 *help*
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 00:03:09 BLYAT
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 00:03:39 Maybe he found out the Soviet Union broke down on his phone in class
plane-crazy 2019-10-29 00:03:46 I don’t know what else to think about that one

plane-crazy 2019-11-04 01:58:59 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 01:59:07 its hard to get flying with most of the wings being fake
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 01:59:29 high wing loading, its abysmal in turns but a magnet drive's brute force keeps it above the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 02:00:27 damn it really do be like that sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 02:01:31 try making an aiming system in your suspension
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 02:01:37 like s-tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 02:01:56 that's your first mistake
plane-crazy 2019-11-04 02:02:06 yup
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 21:22:23 ze luftwaffles
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 21:40:43 boom
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 21:41:51 looks like the shape is about right
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:35:34 who wants to see something cursed
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:35:37 actually nvm I wasn't asking
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:36:01 Corsair 190
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:39:42 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:39:48 im using cameras to build it
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:40:00 its on the stand for assembly
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:40:07 once it flies I might take it off the stand
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:40:15 you know because then it could uh move
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:40:47 like the wing pieces fall onto the slopes
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:40:51 its only there to give it initial shape
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:42:22 ok so it turns out the cursed plane does fly
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:42:43 what do I call it
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:42:48 Fw4U?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:42:54 Corsair 190?
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:01 y e s
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:14 once I paint it the right damn colour
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:19 it might actually resemble the F4U
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:26 but since I built it by using my Fw 190 as a base
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:27 its hella cursed
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:43:49 eh
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:44:08 I don't think my plane is *that* small
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:44:29 when u look at this boi in a real one
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:44:35 If I make it much bigger its gonna look too chonk
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:44:46 its gonna be like P47 style chonk
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:50:16 so the abomination is surprisingly flyable
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:50:27 for a Fw 190 bashed into resembling a corsair
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 19:50:34 and it doesn't even have its magnet drive yet
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 02:02:32 corsair has climbed too high
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:37:27 F4U Corsair
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:02 
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:37 I built it by cannibalizing my Fw 190
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:38:50 so it is smaller than it probably should be
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:39:01 but it was a design concession as it did not work easily at a larger scale
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:39:09 Due to the magnet weld stuff
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:39:22 also yes the bot broke
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:40:20 Assembly frame
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:40:34 You have no idea how many iterations of that frame I had to go through
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:40:48 lol the bot added votes to my first image
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:40:50 at least its trying
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:41:20 wait that worked
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:41:23 it did the 2nd image
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:41:33 tell it to wake up again
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:41:37 you clearly have some kind of power
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:42:06 well the AI uprising has begun
creations-chat 2019-11-14 21:42:13 better start learning how to speak binary
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:53:18 So text placed next to each other will be filtered and possibly censored
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:53:26 you underestimate my magnet welds
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:54:17 fucl the chat filter
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:54:42 fricl
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:55:18 well with text I can finally tell people immediately that my bomber is not a lancaster, b-17 or b-29
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:55:25 not that it even looks like the last two
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:55:30 but people say it anyways
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:56:46 gib bigger props
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:57:08 where are longer delta wings
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 15:57:41 are longer delta wings hidden in the same place as lower wing parts
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:46:56 I use guided bombs against turrets so no
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:46:59 I am not
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 16:47:43 Make a bus that explodes if it goes under 300 speed
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 03:44:26 I’m surprised by the lack of guided bombs in PVP servers
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 04:03:28 There really are very few competent PVP designs out there
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 04:04:11 Most are little 200 speed planes that are incredibly hard to hit because I can’t even fly that speed without stalling
plane-crazy 2020-01-21 17:39:40 I’m surprised by how insane conveyor drives are
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:46:08 dear god PVP sucks so much ass
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:46:25 everyone has these tiny 5 block wide things that turn on a dime and fly at the speed of a glacier
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:46:34 and even when you hit it doesn't register 90% of the time
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:47:19 its like trying to hit a mosquito with a 120mm
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:47:42 my planes don't even fly slow enough to stay behind
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:47:53 and again, most hits fail to register
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:48:03 so they end up appearing as a flying seat on my client
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:48:18 it is fun when the enemy build is uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:48:20 competent
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:48:31 and larger than the first electron orbit
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:48:43 yeah crazy right!?!?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:49:09 and so many youtube fighter builds
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:49:13 dear god they're everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:05 this is what I've been (trying) to use in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:15 you can bet it stalls out trying to keep with anyone
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:28 because everyone flies at 100 for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:52:34 and is impossible to hit
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:54:45 oh I see
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:54:46 in creations
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:55:02 yeah you gotta mesh half blocks with the wing better
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 22:55:10 make it appear smooth
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:38:21 hot
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:38:33 make the N1 and have it explode randomly
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:38:45 so... make the N1, sorry that part about the explosions was redundant
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:39:00 nice starship
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:39:34 true
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:27:07 my wing loading on the B-25 is so high its terrible
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:27:15 dogfighting is cancer when you fight planes that turn on dimes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:28:02 probably under 10 wing panels to lift this 1000 part monster
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:28:26 do it if you want
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:28:29 I'm not your mother
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:30:03 how many parts
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:52:27 I hate it when people assume my builds are tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:52:58 yeah I know
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:53:03 I'm saying in general
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:53:15 yeah I know its not me
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:53:32 my build process is too convoluted and unorganized to be a tutorial anyways
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:53:59 I couldn't explain how to build my shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 13:54:06 because I don't know what I even did
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 14:09:13 B-25?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 14:09:16
