general 2023-04-30 11:00:43 Every heard of World Of Tank?
general 2023-04-30 11:01:05 Well, during 2013-2020 they release paper models of tanks
general 2023-04-30 11:01:17 Like, some highly detailed, soem simple
general 2023-04-30 11:01:37 Sure. I could screenshare if you wish in DMs
general 2023-04-30 11:01:57 Well, they were for free
general 2023-04-30 11:02:03 Yea
general 2023-04-30 11:02:11 Sadly, the russian website is gone
general 2023-04-30 11:02:18 As Wargaming closed studios in russia
general 2023-04-30 11:02:23 Due to sanctions
general 2023-04-30 11:02:33 And I have 250+ mdoels of those
general 2023-04-30 11:02:49 And some bonus robotechnik models
general 2023-04-30 11:02:56 They said that they permanently closed servers
general 2023-04-30 11:03:28 I cannot share images I don't know why
general 2023-04-30 11:03:52 Yea, they come in .pdf
general 2023-04-30 11:04:01 The whole template
general 2023-04-30 11:04:25 Some have customization, liek boxes that add insignias
general 2023-04-30 11:04:35 Now that is the hard question, nightchaser
general 2023-04-30 11:04:45 Because most websites that still have them now sell them
general 2023-04-30 11:05:02 Yup.
general 2023-04-30 11:05:12 Luckily, I got mine for free before the website shut down
general 2023-04-30 11:05:36 Right, I have an idea.
general 2023-04-30 11:05:43 Would you guys liike the models?

general 2023-05-04 21:51:34 A plane is made from individual cone slips of paper that has to be printed out, cut, glued and assemvled

general 2023-05-22 15:55:07 Hey guys
general 2023-05-22 15:55:15 Anyone interested in papercraft?
general 2023-05-22 15:55:22 Like tanks, minecraft, e.t.c?
general 2023-05-22 15:57:11 Why?
general 2023-05-22 15:57:22 😦
general 2023-05-22 15:57:27 Seriously though
general 2023-05-22 15:57:35 I am building a big archive of paper models
general 2023-05-22 15:57:38 5Gb+
general 2023-05-22 15:57:52 If anyoen is interested, hit meup on DM
general 2023-05-22 16:01:06 I mean, I have no other means of spreading the word
general 2023-05-22 16:01:14 I am building an archive of paper models I find
general 2023-05-22 16:01:17 its 5gb+
general 2023-05-22 16:01:27 and a good chunk I make myself
general 2023-05-22 16:01:40 By exporting models from games, like roblox
general 2023-05-22 16:02:30 SO far I have extracted guns and maps from Phantom forces, A few from Plane Crazy (it didn't work out well)
general 2023-05-22 16:06:32 Nah
general 2023-05-22 16:06:35 I make them myself
general 2023-05-22 16:06:47 By copieing textures from photographs and from leaks
general 2023-05-22 16:07:07 I mean, I do use the Roblox Studio
general 2023-05-22 16:07:13 Contains a tonne of leaked content
general 2023-05-22 16:07:50 the problem is, you have to extract it from studio into blender, to then re-align the textures, then formatt it, then let Paperkura Designer 5 un-wrap iut for you, then edit the template to make ti buildable.
general 2023-05-22 16:07:53 Its painfun
general 2023-05-22 16:08:28 And most of the time the shapes are made from overlapping polygons, so I have to manually combine them with the boolean tool in Blender
general 2023-05-22 16:08:39 Most models have on average about 2000 polygons
general 2023-05-22 16:09:41 It does
general 2023-05-22 16:09:47 'Export selection'
general 2023-05-22 16:09:57 which exports all selected objects
general 2023-05-22 16:10:08 though you have to be careful to put the camera close to the object
general 2023-05-22 16:10:19 because if not, it will be immpossile to view in blender properly
general 2023-05-22 16:10:34 Are you interested in papercraft?
general 2023-05-22 16:11:28 Ok
general 2023-05-22 16:11:57 Nut
general 2023-05-22 16:12:46 With the right tools and knowledge, you can extract any models from games
general 2023-05-22 16:12:56 I extracted Half Life 2 models too
general 2023-05-22 16:13:03 And some Half Life 1
general 2023-05-22 16:13:16 It is way easier, though you need to use 4 seperate programs
general 2023-05-22 16:13:49 FOr what, salty?
general 2023-05-22 16:14:00 What game?
general 2023-05-22 16:14:18 Not really
general 2023-05-22 16:14:24 It all depends on the game engine
general 2023-05-22 16:14:37 2d games have sprites
general 2023-05-22 16:14:47 most just already come in  a jpg or png formatt
general 2023-05-22 16:14:56 But not all
general 2023-05-22 16:15:06 Especially source and goldsource
general 2023-05-22 16:15:41 Interesting. I have heard a bit about the proprietary tool
general 2023-05-22 16:15:57 Bro, Unreal engine isn o match for Source engine
general 2023-05-22 16:16:10 It has better physics, looks better too
general 2023-05-22 16:17:00 I prefer Sketchup.
general 2023-05-22 16:17:27 Though if I need to sculpt something, blender is always the best.
general 2023-05-22 16:17:43 Though I do wish they took the 4 screen/view format from 3ds and put it there
general 2023-05-22 16:18:33 I wish Blender had the 4 screen view like in 3DS
general 2023-05-22 16:19:23 So, Is anyone interested in paper models?
general 2023-05-22 16:19:32 ik thearmadaleader isn't
