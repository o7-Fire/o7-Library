creations-chat 2018-10-31 21:38:40 oh no
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 21:42:42 Neutral steering on tanks is great

creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:35:03 I've made a monster
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:36:48 It's pretty effective, I've shot down a few planes with minimal damage
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:37:03 
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:37:10 Expandable armor
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:26 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:41 It can even function while heavily damaged, losing about 70% of its wheels
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:02 Because "dual drive train simulation"
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:57 This thing can also handle terrain like a champ
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:43:59 I'm pretty impressed with myself with this design given how limited we are with the building in this game
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:10:42 I shall run it over with my tank
general 2018-11-02 19:33:02 oh no one of the people who stereotypes spanish by putting os on the end of words
creations-chat 2018-11-03 04:47:52 <@!163143541160148992> Took a little inspiration off your suspension system, hope you don't mind ‚ù§
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:07:27 Its pretty much the suspension on irl cars
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:07:33 Although it be a little more... complex
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:13:08 It's simple yeah but not many people first think of something like this
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:13:23 And not really many people know how a double wishbone suspension work
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:14:19 If you want to join my server you can see how it works pretty easily
general 2018-11-03 20:21:48 I think hes dying because light theme
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:26:03 Did someone say fast over terrain
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:26:26 Why not just shoot your car out of the railgun
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:27:13 Fast boy
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:28:34 Henl0 and welcome to memes
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:29:25 My macro that clicks 183 times a second is great
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:29:44 My game crashes before all of them shoot but we don't speak of that
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:29:55 I need to up my game then
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:30:14 I haven't messed with magnets so I dunno
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:30:40 ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:30:50 Planes don't just have control surfaces on the tail

plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:31:42 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:32:16 I love the suspension system I made
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:32:18 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:32:59 *facedesk*
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:33:06 Its what allows the plane to turn
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:33:09 Control
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:33:10 surface
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:33:15 Its a wing surface for control lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:33:57 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:34:22 Every plane has all of them with few exceptions
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:35:12 Put some basis into real life planes at first to understand how the flight system works
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:36:01 Yep
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:36:28 Trying to apply simple concepts of aerospace/aeronautical design helps a lot
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:36:58 Good thing that will be my major in college
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:37:12 But if you have to put helium in a plane thats big bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:37:30 A plane should fly without any sort of assistance
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:38:53 Why not make planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:39:25 My awkward space shuttle looking tank might do well against it
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:39:46 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:41:56 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:45:19 I like the shape of the tanks people make but not how they do the wheels
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:45:32 I'll try my new tank suspension concept on something soon
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:56:02 What gets you an inventor rank ü§î
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:56:19 oh

plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:57:23 Hm
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:57:30 Lots of the ranks seem pretty easy with what I have built
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 20:58:33 The rating ranks seem pretty easy but I guess people don't really vote

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:42:11 So what if I drive it into water
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:42:22 Assuming it floats
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 03:43:44 What if it moves at at 2sps

plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:39:01 You have to earn it
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:40:56 Why is innovation being brought up?
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:55:37 The ranks are just for bragging rights on this discord I suppose
plane-crazy 2018-11-05 22:56:15 Now how can I get my carrier to give me even more ranks

plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:04:52 Suggesting as if a majority of discord is roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:05:41 Steam is a ripoff discord at this point
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:06:05 
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:06:22 A store on a gaming platform isn't that rare..
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:07:04 But steams new group chats are pretty much discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:07:05 Theres roles
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:07:07 CHannels
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:07:12 Perms

plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:08:37 The discord store was about 3 weeks ago
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:10:12 Overall though
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:10:18 Discord is better for comms
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:10:22 Steam is a better game store
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:11:16 Its also one of the oldest
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 00:11:42 fightfightfight

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:39:33 Depends if you like arcade, realistic, or simulation
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:39:37 And what forces you're playing
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:39:46 WT is better then WOT
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:39:56 Does WOT have component damage?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:13 Can you yeet the barrel and breech separately
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:23 Same <@!205530813264166912>
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:33 I played WOT and it felt like that
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:52 WOT looks like a more arcade game though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:41:04 WT looks better also
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:41:32 Yeah but can you shoot tanks with planes in WOT
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:41:43 Never heard of it hawk
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:42:04 SO unrealistic
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:42:44 All I've seen of it, it seems worse
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:43:34 Atleast there aren't separate games for separate forces in WT
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:44:14 11

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:51

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:56:37 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:56:57 Fun fact
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:57:09 The heli flight model in WT is from their failed helicopter game before they made WT
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:57:28 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:02 y
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:02 Well if it was made very realistic it wouldn't be that fun to pla
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:14 If you want a realistic flight model go play DCS
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:21 Andromeda
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:24 WT isn't a simulator
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:27 However DCS is
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:46 I was talking about graphics when did I mention realistic
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:27 If you want a realistic flight model play DCS lmao
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:36 I hear the huey is pretty realistic
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:56 Apparently actual huey pilots have flown it ingame and said it is a near perfect recreation for a video game
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:00:53 I wasn't talking about realism when talking about component damage
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:00:58 I was talking about overall features
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:01:29 ü§î
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:01:50 ^
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:02:00 I prefer realistic simulators
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:02:18 I love DCS but sometimes its too complex for me
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:02:40 Having to press every single button and flip every switch to turn on the plane like real life
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:03:02 Arma is pretty good

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:13:45 Bombs are normally dumb fire
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:26 Thats smart fire
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:14:47 A bomb like a cruise missile is a cruise missile
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:15:02 I mean you have guided bombs but those are entirely different
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:16:46 A helicopter is technically a vtol
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:16:57 I don't think it is here though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 04:17:03 VTOL = vertical take off and landing

plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:56:54 hey man thats nsfw
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:59:43 If he's under 13 he shouldn't even be in the discord
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 18:59:55 Since discord is cracking down on servers with under 13s
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:01:03 This discord is more like "Jameson yells at yet another rule breaker simulator"
plane-crazy 2018-12-12 19:01:49 Discord ToS says you can't be under 13 so who knows
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:06:06 Has anyone made a K-Max yet?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:06:38 An irl meme of a helicopter

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:09:29 /e dab
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:20:01 Wowza I got the prop system to work
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:21:06 Still needs a bit of fine tuning but it can for the most part not kill the other propeller
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:22:48 Off it goes
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:22:54 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:24:25 What does fix even do lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:25:40 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:25:59 As soon as I try to record a gif the props hit eachother
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:26:48 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:34:41 Helicopters are confusing as hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:34:53 No matter what I do the center of mass wont move forward
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:35:55 big what
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:36:15 What if my heli has no alto rotor
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:36:42 (military term for rear rotor)
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:36:53 My heli has no rear rotor
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:38:14 Again what
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 03:39:32 My first heli probably shouldn't be a compact and complex one lmao
creations-chat 2018-12-13 05:01:12 <@!507721348307746816>
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:28:35 <@163143541160148992> I started working on a biped walker quite a bit ago
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:28:46 I will say it is tough as hell to keep it upright even with a good COM
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:29:12 
creations-chat 2018-12-13 10:26:17 I think for prop master it needs to be in a stable flight and can move around freely
creations-chat 2018-12-13 10:26:35 For me, I did a prop plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:28:01 So uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:28:20 Roblox is trying to shutdown support for third party closed source models
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:28:39 Aka admin scripts won't work, inserting models with admin won't work, etc etc
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:28:50 Affects the car community more then anyone else tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:41:42 Welcome to america
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:00 The US is pretty much a mix of every language on earth
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:39 Every language?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:49 Theres over 2000+ known languages lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:42:59 I think its around 2000
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:43:43 The US has no main language but people argue its English
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:44:06 But then again I do need to know a second language to even graduate from highschool
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:06 Theres more spanish speaking people in the US then English speaking I believe
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:45:57 Fun fact, theres a spanish speaking African country
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:47:03 I'll shoot it out of the sky with my mech's ejection seat
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 15:49:12 Make a biped mech that throws an airplane
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:29:15 oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:30:38 I don't think you can get any GTR without an import
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:30:53 GTRs will be expensive as hell either way
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:31:09 Isn't that the Prince Skyline?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:31:48 Thats not 1981 but k
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:32:15 I mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:32:21 1989 is still wrong but I get what you mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:32:34 ü§î
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:32:49 1st gen Skyline GTR is cool, change my mind
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:33:12 smh
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:34:14 Fear the man
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:34:31 I'll fix it later
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:34:36 Its temp
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:34:43 Fyt
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:35:10 That carrier is odd
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:35:30 That capital would kill any plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:35:54 Ejection seats 101
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:36:16 Sonnuy thats not an atc tower
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:36:20 It acts as one, but is not one
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:36:28 Is that a Tu-144?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:38:09 Land carrier best carrier
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:38:36 Honestly its useless building a capital on carriers
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:38:50 With the flight model ingame, you can land anything on a carrier with a capital
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:39:35 Or use sharex
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:39:41 ShareX is by far the best lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:40:12 this hurt
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:42:38 Subarus are badd
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:42:43 Mitsubishi is better
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:42:57 Nissans are slow
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:43:06 Mitsubishis can outrun Lamborghinis in a track
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:43:20 They did it in Top Gear so who knows
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:43:45 GTRs are pretty slow
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:43:48 Bad acceleration
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:43:53 I dunno about the R35 now
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:44:00 But the older gens had pretty bad 0-60s
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 16:44:22 And Lancer Evolutions have both good accel and top speed
general 2018-12-13 16:44:41 <@205404956759556096> No u
general 2018-12-13 16:45:06 wait what
general 2018-12-13 16:45:07 how tf
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:25:00 jank
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:25:25 Getting a working camshaft and such will be tough
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:32:34 How do you make a good gear
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:34:22 Why would it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:34:33 Motor lock is to stop the motor from being affected by the enviroment
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:34:46 Welding would just mess it up
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:34:55 And cause unnecessary lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:36:04 Is that even possible with lua?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:36:54 I doubt it'll change like that though
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:37:14 I mean change to where it welds
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 17:37:59 Super is more powerful
general 2018-12-13 22:55:56 Snow
general 2018-12-13 22:56:40 I got 14 overnight
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:24:22 Now how do I transfer this power to wheels
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:12 Ships back then were pretty wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:17 What kind of ship it it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:25 ü§î
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:25:44 
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:26:18 Make a laggy boy sail and make the sail actually work
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:26:28 What <@!362351190618538005>

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:28:57 Is the official vip server not up?
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:29:14 There are tracks
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:29:17 ‚ù§
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:29:17 Make your own
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:29:36 Well prebuilt tracks would ruin the fun of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:29:57 Tracks are a rare thing to see and they, in my opinion, should stay that way
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:30:18 Same with suspensions
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:30:27 Theres hundreds of suspensions possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:30:40 Has anyone made a track with suspension?

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:32:25 This was funny one time
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:32:32 Someone was building a tutorial vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:32:39 Creator of the tutorial was in the game
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:32:45 Started crap talking him lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:34:44 Holy crap I just found a candy more sour then warheads
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:35:03 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 23:35:14 I meant the candy warheads
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 00:15:23 Oh god a weaponized balloon boyo
the-dump 2018-12-17 10:35:40 It‚Äôs a repost, I‚Äôve seen it before
the-dump 2018-12-17 10:36:15 Also edit element it
general 2018-12-19 00:15:58 I've already made a piston engine
general 2018-12-19 00:16:13 Its really hard to transfer power to wheels, still haven't gotten it down yet
general 2018-12-19 00:17:59 Its an I2 and very wonky
general 2018-12-19 00:18:24 You can't make effective engines since the pistons are 5x5s I think
general 2018-12-19 00:18:32 Making a space for a gearbox is even harder
general 2018-12-19 00:18:45 Wheres the in in that
general 2018-12-19 00:18:55 fun*
general 2018-12-19 00:18:59 Wheres the fun in that*
general 2018-12-19 00:19:44 This is an earlier gif, I have no up to date pics/gifs
general 2018-12-19 00:20:16 I dunno why the pistons are rising at different heights either, again early dev gif
general 2018-12-19 00:22:19 It was tough making even two pistons work in a realistic config
general 2018-12-19 00:22:32 3 separate motors between each piston
general 2018-12-19 00:22:38 Assuming realistic crankshaft setup
general 2018-12-19 00:23:48 I could definitely build a working piston engine in studio, and I already have, but both ingame physics and the game itself are the limitation
general 2018-12-19 00:24:49 I actually need to start work on my helicopter ingame ü§î
general 2018-12-19 00:25:05 Making two rotors not kill eachother mid flight is tough with this design
plane-crazy 2018-12-19 00:30:04 What is the matter if they do get colors?
general 2018-12-19 21:41:01 <:yikes:493522347899486238>

plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:01:33 If the FBI is 15 minutes late, we're legally allowed to lewd the lolis
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:01:47 It is true
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:01:59 Do I need to change my pfp to an even more lewd loli gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:02:26 Its not nsfw lewd
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:02:31 So don't worry on that
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:03:18 She protecc, she attac, but most importantly she thicc as fuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:03:39 Why do people call Kanna a loli
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:03:44 Kanna is legit hundreds of years old
plane-crazy 2018-12-24 12:04:18 Just like Kon from Tokyo Raven
general 2018-12-25 21:53:56 I‚Äôve memes it a lot now
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 22:53:08 I'm waiting for someone to make a full recreation of a tank and have it with tracks
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 22:53:54 Flexibility
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 22:54:27 Ski lift but using tank tracks <:spicy:495799545104695296>
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 04:52:23 PVP mode, the only place you see even worse creations
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 04:57:33 Is gun spam allowed in pvp ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 04:57:41 That's all I'm really seeing in pvp lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:02:14 Someone's trying to bypass the filter now because they got mad over a gun spam vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:23:27 1.15 will probably be a dimension update
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:23:43 True, true
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:23:50 Caves might be a pretty high chance then
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:24:02 Quartz are crystals
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:24:16 **Emerald armor**
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:24:27 Flame
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:24:39 The reason for the trident is a nod to the city of Atlantis
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:24:44 So it's only going to be that trident
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:25:30 Nether update :spicy:
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:25:47 The nether seems fairly dull
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:25:54 More nether mobs maybe
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:26:41 I just googled it
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:26:48 And they hinted at what 1.15 might be
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:27:04 1.15 is either a cave or combat update
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:27:18 When 1.14 comes out I can improve my farm to the next level
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:27:35 I play on sp
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:27:43 Single
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:27:55 Well I play on my own server actually
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:28:00 Small private one with a few friends
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:28:32 what
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:29:14 Iron golems
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:29:17 From villages
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:29:26 They're pretty complex
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:29:53 I find high quality builds with nice shaders attached pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:30:00 For example this thing I built
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:30:07 
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:30:38 Grian builds higher quality lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:31:18 Mumbo is redstone

plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:33:23 ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:35:28 Is it technically cheating to use optifine
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:35:44 But it has a zoom feature
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:35:52 Which allows you to see past server loading distance
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:36:00 I mean it is general
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:36:01 But like
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:36:04 2 mods joined in on the convo
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:38:11 ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:38:24 I made an apc with tracks
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 05:38:26 So who knows
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 14:59:49 I got bored and made a tracked apc that's stupidly slim for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 14:59:54 
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:00:22 Only 3 blocks thicc
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:01:01 ohno
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:01:15 Do I need to make some reactive armor for this sir
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:01:46 How do I dodge when the speed is uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:01:47 41
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:02:03 Any faster and the tracks become slightly unstable
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:02:54 Tbh I've not seen a motor track
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:02:57 So I dunno
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:03:08 I'll see how fast this track can handle
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:03:13 Oh no
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:04:04 Yikes
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:04:14 The motor track looks a lot more complicated
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:04:52 Ok so
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:05:00 I got the tracks to reach a speed of 91
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:05:13 But now the suspension is unstable
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:05:46 <@458451488335986688> That's kinda hard
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:05:54 That's a universal weakpoint on almost every tank irl
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:06:36 I mean you could armor it if you built the turret into the hull
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:06:40 I think the abrams irl does that
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:07:13 Tracks are really satisfying when they break
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:07:43 Woops
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:08:42 It's too bad tracks are kinda oof at terrain
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:08:56 Then again most suspensions/forms of ground locomotion are bad in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:09:00 Because theres no damn friction
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:10:16 I was about to ask how the hell you keep the track on
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:10:22 Then I realized you use a more realistic method
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:10:59 I keep mine on like this
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:11:20 Why are people's brightness to 0
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:12:04 There goes a track
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 15:12:46 Do you think the suspension would work better if I did this?
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:12:28 Oh henlo there
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:12:38 Yikes for images not uploading
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:13:11 Any image I try to upload just dies

plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:17:41 Thancc
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:17:56 I'm trying to figure out how to bulk up its armor without making it large
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:18:10 And with how the track is made, it's even more difficult
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:21:06 Katze accept my fr on roblox
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:21:24 h
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:38:07 Any recommendations on how to armor this?
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 18:44:01 Is spawn killing allowed lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:03:46 I just added a useless feature to my apc
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:04:58 Well its not useless
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:05:03 But its very scenario based
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:05:39 Say my apc gets memed in water like this
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:06:19 M1 Bradley is an APC with treads
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:06:23 So uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:06:29 Pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:06:44 I said screw treads in water, I'm a boat now
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:07:45 Why does the apc look better as a boat then an apc
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:08:26 I don't see a use in that
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:08:27 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-03 21:09:19 But I still don't see a use in it

plane-crazy 2019-03-05 23:38:59 Would anyone be impressed if I made a semi-realistic tank gun
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 23:39:04 Recoil simulation and all
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 23:39:09 Shell ejections and what not

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:40:52 Fun fact, track are fun as hell to use but hell to make
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:41:28 And the larger the track, the more hell it is
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:41:47 Yikes
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:42:44 >A singular track on this tank I'm building is almost the amount of blocks my smaller tank is total
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:44:29 89 ropes per track yikes
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:46:41 Success?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:02 Tracked vehicles?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:09 Like real tracks vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:14 One tread turns, other doesn't
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:22 Or one tread turns and other turns opposite way
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:31 Just like irl tanks
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:47:45 <@456226577798135808> Join my game and I can show you
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:48:22 My apc could clap his plane
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:48:39 Not really tbh
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:48:43 The armor on my apc is paper thin
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:48:52 As you can tell
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:49:16 What makes it not an APC
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:49:23 Orange key

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:55:03 Maybe
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:55:19 If he walks on water he must swim on land
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:56:38 I've not had any lag issues with rope treads
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:56:49 For example my tread shape
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:56:55 Somewhat complex-ish
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:57:20 It's not a Mark V
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:57:24 Even though tread shape is similar
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:57:41 If I wanted a Mark V
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:58:05 There'd be a roller right here
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:58:16 
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 23:58:37 And the Mark V does have that bump <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:51:58 One of the most used anime streaming sites was shutdown
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 01:52:02 F for masteranime
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 02:27:35 I love how people remark on how being a mod on a 271 member server is not trained enough

plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:07:35 A particle collider would be difficult asf
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:07:50 I mean people do know particle colliders are miles in length right?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:08:06 Someone just called my tancc "ew"
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:08:52 Time to build a phat boy body on this phat chassis
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:09:20 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:10:24 Someone just speedhacked into my track lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:11:30 Should I make my tank chassis less thicc?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:13:37 The only weakness to tracks is laggy ramming builds
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:13:45 And explosions but we don't talk about those
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:23:48 ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:35:25 I made it chonkier
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:35:40 
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:37:54 I get that comment a lot
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:38:06 But hey, it was a revolutionary design
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:38:17 Mark X
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:38:34 I'm going to put a twin battleship cannon on the top
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:38:37 To say fuck WW1
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:38:52 It's going to have a full interior and everything
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:40:08 It's sponson turrets lmao?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:42:54 Thats one odd F-22
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 03:43:01 Too bad the F-22 has oxygen system failures
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:13:58 Did someone say lag machine
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:14:02 
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:14:23 Except its not 2k+ blocks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:16:35 nosir
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:27:08 Question
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:27:20 Can I make my tank's gun shoot 12 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:31:05 Well my turret is probably too small for that
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:37:14 :spicy:
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 23:42:47 I'm too lazy to build anything complex rn
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:36:47 Another thing is, go based off what you think looks good, don't go based solely off peoples opinions
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:36:57 That'll hurt you in the long run
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:38:09 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:38:28 I guess it was used as an insult on this server at one point\
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:38:38 Not at all
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 02:39:41 I need to find a new design for this oofy turret
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:03:50 Because it is
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:07:09 Tbh that could 1-shot my tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 03:07:17 Well depends where you hit
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:48:45 My game is hella laggy and theres no large builds
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:51:42 It's great how bad the parachutes deploy lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:53:31 <@!217336009455566848> The parachute seems to always open up inside the craft
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:53:43 Atleast it does for this
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:55:13 Can the game finally handle my tank lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:57:41 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:57:41 For the parachute
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 22:57:51 Mood
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:19:12 Logically speaking
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:19:15 Which is better
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:19:19 Motor or track tread
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:21:59 Yeah but can your motor track do this ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:22:56 What is honor talking about lmao
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:23:09 How so
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:24:11 You can finally shoot exploding balls at people
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:24:13 :spicy:

plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:27:17 h
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:27:54 You can't see my tancc in the background rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 23:28:19 Now you can
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:04:51 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:04:54 Engineers are engineers
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:05:05 Aerospace kinda just defines what they specialize in specifically
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:05:10 Though their math can go over to any field
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:06:32 <@263770097288609794> English please

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:20:11 God damn
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:20:18 I regret doing the sim
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:20:28 I accidentally slammed the stick right and spinned about 50 times
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:20:55 Then somehow pulled up on the stick
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:21:06 Then almost threw up because god damn that makes you sick
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:21:15 It doesn't simulate a specific aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:21:24 Though you shoot down uh
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 01:21:29 Su-27s I think

general 2019-06-09 09:28:52 Its literally just infernal robotics behind a paywall
general 2019-06-09 09:29:55 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
general 2019-06-09 09:30:16 I guess
general 2019-06-09 09:30:42 Unless infernal robotics gets updated to the most recent version and is actually functionable, its pretty much infernal robotics behind a paywall
general 2019-06-09 09:33:21 I mean yeah passive research is cool and all, but still
general 2019-06-09 09:34:14 With that placed seismometer I believe so yeah
general 2019-06-09 09:34:26 And according to whats his name you can't use kerbals for that luckily
general 2019-06-09 09:37:54 Thats one hecc of a SSTO
general 2019-06-09 09:39:06 Meanwhile I sent a smol relay satellite into LKO
general 2019-06-09 09:39:15 Ignore the fact I have no graphics mods, I was testing the newest version
general 2019-06-09 09:40:11 Can I just say I have uh
general 2019-06-09 09:40:17 309 hours on ksp
general 2019-06-09 09:40:22 But have yet to land on another planet
general 2019-06-09 09:40:27 Let alone orbit another planet
general 2019-06-09 09:40:54 I dont even know how to set up an encounter lmao
general 2019-06-09 09:41:18 Then again I build planes for the most part
general 2019-06-09 09:41:59 Planes are easy sure but getting them to do real specific things is hard
general 2019-06-09 09:42:16 I got a plane that takes off at 5m/s
general 2019-06-09 09:42:40 Aka this thing
general 2019-06-09 09:42:54 On this carrier
general 2019-06-09 09:44:18 DarkMP?
general 2019-06-09 09:44:40 Never heard of that mp thing
general 2019-06-09 09:44:55 Will it be stock or?
general 2019-06-09 09:46:24 Does it have North Kerbin Dynamics?
general 2019-06-09 09:46:52 Dang it doesnt
general 2019-06-09 09:48:02 I wouldn't do BDArmory tbh though
general 2019-06-09 09:48:13 It has lots of conflicting files and it's a mess to deal with
general 2019-06-09 09:48:36 Throw North Kerbin Dynamics in there, trust me
general 2019-06-09 09:49:04 Uh yes
general 2019-06-09 09:49:25 I'll design a stratolauncher lmao
general 2019-06-09 09:49:47 Launching rockets idfk
general 2019-06-09 09:49:57 Get that first 3400 m/s of deltav out of the way
general 2019-06-09 09:50:09 Thats not a stratolauncher sir lmao
general 2019-06-09 09:50:57 When its supposably able to carry a falcon heavy
general 2019-06-09 09:51:03 I mean ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
general 2019-06-09 09:51:39 Yeah I don't lmao
general 2019-06-09 09:51:44 It looks familiar tho
general 2019-06-09 09:52:13 
general 2019-06-09 09:52:44 Thats a smaller stratolauncher
general 2019-06-09 09:52:53 Not the big one
general 2019-06-09 09:53:10 I did
general 2019-06-09 09:53:35 The one weird thing with the tail that flops around like a maniac during reentry
general 2019-06-09 09:55:37 683m/s of deltav is definitely enough for LKO
general 2019-06-09 09:55:40 üíØ
general 2019-06-09 10:02:03 Is reaching LKO with SRBs difficult by any means
general 2019-06-09 11:07:06 I'm aboutta attempt building a craft for the mun
general 2019-06-09 11:07:15 Any tips for building it and tips for the trip to?
general 2019-06-09 11:08:10 I mean I could just leave a kerbal on the mun
general 2019-06-09 11:08:15 And do a rescue mission later
general 2019-06-09 11:08:40 I dunno how to rendezvous so I can't do apollo style
general 2019-06-09 11:10:27 Ok so pull out the handy deltav map
general 2019-06-09 11:10:50 5150m/s to land apparently
general 2019-06-09 11:13:38 I keep forgetting I can use tweakscale to cheese the game
general 2019-06-09 11:14:11 If you put a heatshield on the bottom of it, it should be fine
general 2019-06-09 11:14:16 Heatshields have a high impact tolerance
general 2019-06-09 11:16:01 Would that suffice as an early game mun lander?
general 2019-06-09 11:16:21 Early game sir
general 2019-06-09 11:16:24 Dont have those yet
general 2019-06-09 11:16:51 1 sec
general 2019-06-09 11:17:08 This is the extent of my tree
general 2019-06-09 11:17:43 Wouldn't that make it less efficient in atmosphere?
general 2019-06-09 11:19:05 How about that
general 2019-06-09 11:19:37 And basically spam deltav where I need it
general 2019-06-09 11:19:51 Is 1400m/s on the lander  good enough to get home?
general 2019-06-09 11:20:33 So I need 3400 to get to LKO
general 2019-06-09 11:20:42 860 for encounter?
general 2019-06-09 11:20:54 Tbh idfk I've never gone to the mun
general 2019-06-09 11:21:29 Jesus christ the TWR of my mun lander is 9.4 on the mun
general 2019-06-09 11:22:30 Should I use a terrier or swivel engine to get to the mun from LKO
general 2019-06-09 11:23:05 I dunno how to use KER rip
general 2019-06-09 11:23:15 Dunno how much delta v I have in vacuum
general 2019-06-09 11:23:43 Well stock doesnt account for gravity and such does it?
general 2019-06-09 11:24:20 Stock says I have 200m/s on this stage
general 2019-06-09 11:24:25 KER says 1200m/s
general 2019-06-09 11:25:00 I just realized I could change the delta v thing for stock lmao
general 2019-06-09 11:25:41 Should that get to the mun lmao
general 2019-06-09 11:25:42 From LKO
general 2019-06-09 11:28:30 oof
general 2019-06-09 11:34:00 This is the final design I'm going with
general 2019-06-09 11:34:51 Danke
general 2019-06-09 11:38:43 I might've miscalculated dV
general 2019-06-09 11:40:26 I may of fucked up already lmao
general 2019-06-09 11:40:40 My orbit isn't alligned with the mun
general 2019-06-09 11:41:12 I dunno
general 2019-06-09 11:41:34 I dunno how tbh
general 2019-06-09 11:42:37 Ok why did the dV go down all the sudden
general 2019-06-09 11:42:56 My dV before launching was 3500 for my LKO stage
general 2019-06-09 11:43:01 Now its 2700
general 2019-06-09 11:44:16 Why does my first stage only have 400m/s now
general 2019-06-09 11:45:11 I've gotten to the point to where the more fuel I add the less m/s of dV I have
general 2019-06-09 11:47:21 Theres a reason I took a 6 month break from ksp
general 2019-06-09 11:47:33 And thats because dV calculations are confusing as fuck
general 2019-06-09 11:48:13 I know
general 2019-06-09 11:48:19 But the more fuel I add, the lower the dV goes
general 2019-06-09 11:48:33 And if I add engines, dV also goes down
general 2019-06-09 11:49:04 Ok literally in the VAB it said I had 3700m/s of fuel in kerbin atmosphere
general 2019-06-09 11:49:09 When I launch it says I have 2100m/s
general 2019-06-09 11:49:44 Wym fix staging
general 2019-06-09 11:49:58 
general 2019-06-09 11:53:39 It does save fuel
general 2019-06-09 12:34:53 I done did it
general 2019-06-09 12:34:55 
general 2019-06-09 12:34:55 
general 2019-06-10 08:02:13 This is gonna hurt
general 2019-06-10 08:14:46 And basically low tier probe work
general 2019-06-10 08:36:13 
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:32:12 Watching people copy crappy builds is funny as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:32:34 I have a barely working tandem rotor helicopter concept and someones copying it lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:33:34 This is literally my build
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:34:13 Then you have this
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:35:26 I'm literally just testing concept of tandem rotors and how much they can carry
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:35:35 And someone is literally copying
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 23:35:57 And their not even hiding it, they walk up to my heli whenever I land lmao
general 2019-06-24 00:27:41 You uh
general 2019-06-24 00:27:45 Put rockret on top of fuel stick
general 2019-06-24 03:49:48 Why are you scripting staging?
general 2019-06-24 04:08:07 Then again I got bored and made a script that I believe counts down a launch, fires the engine until out of fuel, then deploys the parachute at a certain speed
general 2019-06-24 04:08:13 ```
CLEARSCREEN.

PRINT "Program Executed"
 LOCK THROTTLE TO 1.0.
  WAIT 1.


PRINT "Counting down:"
From {local countdown is 10."} UNTIL countdown = 0 STEP {SET countdown to countdown - 1.} DO {
    PRINT "T - " + countdown.
     WAIT 1.
}


UNTIL SHIP:MAXTHRUST > 0 {
    WAIT 0.5.
     PRINT "Staging in progress".
      STAGE.
       WAIT 1.
        PRINT "Staging complete".
}


WAIT 5.


IF SHIP:VELOCITY:SURFACE:MAG >= 400 {
    WAIT 0.5.
     PRINT "Deploying parachute(s)"
      STAGE.
       WAIT 1
        PRINT "Deployed parachutes"
}


END
```
general 2019-06-24 08:04:12 kOS has its own code language
general 2019-06-24 08:04:19 Its not based off any real one I don't think
general 2019-06-26 16:25:34 Why would this be flipping
general 2019-06-26 16:25:45 At about 10km it just starts to slowly flip out of control
general 2019-06-26 16:26:38 The CoM is a little low actually
general 2019-06-26 16:26:45 The payload is quite light
general 2019-06-26 16:27:00 For KSP standards atleast
general 2019-06-26 16:30:11 I mean it flies up fine
general 2019-06-26 16:30:20 But if I make any maneuvers it just flips
general 2019-06-26 20:27:51 I decided making a giant comm satellite with overkill energy generation was a good idea
general 2019-06-26 20:28:31 Yay
general 2019-06-26 20:28:40 I might make a lunar lander with a drone attached
general 2019-06-26 20:28:52 + overkill it and make a micro sat for the mun
general 2019-06-26 20:29:27 Scratch that 2 micro sats
general 2019-06-26 20:30:40 I've barely just done my first mission to the mun
general 2019-06-26 20:30:52 I just know how to make things look cool and function
general 2019-06-26 20:31:23 THIS is your most important tool
general 2019-06-26 20:31:37 <@!185171693566689280>
general 2019-06-26 20:32:06 It will help once you get the basics
general 2019-06-26 20:32:59 How the fucc do I get a duna transfer window
general 2019-06-26 20:35:32 SSTOs are shit but dont tell anyone!
general 2019-06-26 20:35:56 Can they get into LKO with less then 3400m/s of fuel?
general 2019-06-26 20:36:18 That'd defeat the concept of a plane being flown into space
general 2019-06-26 20:37:20 How to lander 101
general 2019-06-26 20:38:22 Well vip
general 2019-06-26 20:38:31 Its going to be a skycrane and a lander
general 2019-06-26 20:38:37 The drone goes on the bottom once its built
general 2019-06-26 20:38:52 Dont ask why I have a manned drone mission
general 2019-06-26 20:38:53 But I do
general 2019-06-26 20:39:15 The space shuttle can't fly despite common belief
general 2019-06-26 20:39:30 Its a literal brick being thrown into atmosphere
general 2019-06-26 20:44:15 Thats the ez part
general 2019-06-26 20:44:42 Micro drone 101
general 2019-06-26 20:45:09 Actually I'm going to make a drone/buggy hybrid
general 2019-06-26 20:50:57 Going from 700 hours of building exclusively planes to trying rockets was oof for me
general 2019-06-26 20:51:35 Buggy 101
general 2019-06-26 21:10:11 I decided to deliver it to Minmus instead
general 2019-06-26 21:15:32 Can you theoretically land on minmus with ion engines
general 2019-06-26 21:21:16 Would a single ion engine successfully land a single person lander lmao
general 2019-06-26 21:34:42 Could I land on minmus with 7m/s of fuel
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 04:19:22 
general 2019-06-28 05:00:56 Well over 2000 different shoots are required <@!429665143677255681>
general 2019-06-28 05:03:15 I dunno man, must be CGI
general 2019-06-28 05:03:21 
general 2019-06-28 05:04:08 And for a big plane we have a smol payload
general 2019-06-28 05:10:24 
general 2019-06-28 05:11:21 ree
general 2019-06-28 05:14:01 Elon Musk 101
general 2019-06-28 05:14:37 
general 2019-06-28 05:33:58 
general 2019-06-28 07:52:48 I decided to give my super small satellite a really high kerbin orbit
general 2019-06-28 07:53:03 2000km high
general 2019-06-28 08:05:22 Legendary my probe has enough fuel to go into LKO and out to 2000km orbit 10 times
general 2019-06-28 08:05:28 Xenon fuel is efficient asf
general 2019-06-28 09:42:09 <@!185171693566689280> Proper design is everything in KSP
general 2019-06-28 09:42:21 This SSTO got a satellite to a 2000km orbit above kerbin
general 2019-06-28 10:10:48 I just now learned autostrut was a thing
general 2019-06-28 10:38:34 How to set up a comm net system 101
general 2019-06-28 10:39:51 I had to add external fuel tanks so it could make it to space so oof
general 2019-06-28 10:40:06 That wing design is funky asf
general 2019-06-28 10:41:04 Holy fuck
general 2019-06-28 10:41:53 Double stack that engine design
general 2019-06-28 10:41:58 Double the carrying capacity
general 2019-06-28 10:42:08 :spicy:
general 2019-06-28 10:43:15 14000m/s of fuel for LKO
general 2019-06-28 10:43:17 Not op at all
general 2019-06-28 10:43:34 Then again thats how much my SSTO has
general 2019-06-28 10:43:49 What do you mean do you really mean that lmao
general 2019-06-28 10:44:45 14000m/s for that heavy payload 101
general 2019-06-28 10:45:31 And were off
general 2019-06-28 10:46:53 Not necessarily
general 2019-06-28 10:47:02 Just load the fuel as appropriate for the mission
general 2019-06-28 10:47:15 For example I think I overloaded on fuel this mission so its needlessly heavy
general 2019-06-28 10:48:53 About to decouple my externals
general 2019-06-28 10:49:37 And we have a success
general 2019-06-28 10:50:03 Wym?
general 2019-06-28 10:50:54 I barely get to the mun lmao
general 2019-06-28 10:50:58 Let alone get LKO
general 2019-06-28 10:51:14 Ignoring my 2000km orbit of my satellite but still
general 2019-06-28 10:52:32 I forgot to pack monoprop rip
general 2019-06-28 10:52:57 Thats how you oof a station quick
general 2019-06-28 10:53:05 Depending on orbit alt
general 2019-06-28 10:53:49 SSTO VTOL to Minmus for example
general 2019-06-28 10:54:04 A vtol is overkill for minmus
general 2019-06-28 10:54:06 Let alone any rocket
general 2019-06-28 10:55:36 
general 2019-06-28 10:58:32 Off the SSTO goes
general 2019-06-28 11:03:42 
general 2019-06-28 11:07:31 
general 2019-06-28 11:07:59 These comm satellites were
general 2019-06-28 11:11:52 Sandbox
general 2019-06-28 11:12:01 I have kerbnet enabled tho
general 2019-06-28 11:12:38 Time to re enter the atmosphere and land
general 2019-06-28 11:12:52 If I can figure out where the KSC is
general 2019-06-28 11:15:23 I have to land at night so oof
general 2019-06-28 11:21:08 I don't care for pilot safety
general 2019-06-28 11:22:33 I use sharex to take screenshots and gif, I don't record
general 2019-06-28 11:22:37 And I don't do space stations
general 2019-06-28 11:23:09 
general 2019-06-28 11:24:04 ü§î
general 2019-06-28 11:25:30 I mean were alive
general 2019-06-28 11:42:16 <@!271941038375960576> I just quickly slapped together a MK3 SSTO, don't even think it'd get to orbit
general 2019-06-28 11:42:26 
general 2019-06-29 14:53:41 <@456226577798135808> Because BDArmory is shit now
general 2019-06-29 14:53:56 Also this is how you propel a big boy SSTO
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 16:39:58 Oh how roblox is broken
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:44:50 Dude accused me of using helium to make my heli fly but he doesnt realize they're fuel tanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:44:53 Big oof
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:45:38 idfk
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:45:38 Incase I want to fly my heli in limited fuel mode
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:46:06 I'm not going to make a swashplate for a concept design lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:46:16 I have props controlling my pitch and such
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:46:26 
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:46:54 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:47:34 Woops
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:48:02 w0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:49:34 Jebus why are kamikaze vehicles so common in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:49:40 Especially ground based ones
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:49:59 Ima add a turret to my heli
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:50:35 I mean you'd be surprised
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:50:40 My heli is really stable
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:51:41 Woops accidentally took a gif over limit
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:52:16 
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:53:42 Noone has turrets or drones
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:53:52 My server is just pure kamikaze aircrafts
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:54:01 Who don't even know how to fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:55:35 Its safe enough to stand on
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:55:38 Assuming weight imbalance doesnt screw the heli over
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 17:57:46 Love the building man
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 18:08:52 r/woosh
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 18:09:46 How is jiggle nsfw
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 18:09:52 ü§î
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 18:10:00 Yes it can imply but its not nsfw itself
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 18:10:47 Doesnt that build kinda go against server rule 2 tho lmao

plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:50:19 Katze, some people have their reasons for shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:50:27 The furry fandom is a fairly controversial topic
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:53:27 Yikes it looks so different
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:55:25 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:56:42 Is noone gonna chill this situation lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:57:03 <:DOT:592189498029244446>
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:57:33 So how about them tutorial builds huh
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:57:43 <@!398245378861826048> I think its custom emote on this server
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:57:49 Supposed to be like <:OmegaLul:528987216643489792>
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 20:58:41 Its a war between rope and motor treads now
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:00:17 Now thats a victory royale
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:00:27 
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:03:39 The Falcon Heavy boosters are are VTOL
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 21:04:12 lmao
general 2019-07-02 18:59:00 <@!221487880487436288> Whats the orbits periapsis lmao
general 2019-07-02 19:14:18 Could've build an aircraft lmao
general 2019-07-02 19:31:48 It takes less dV to get to minmus
general 2019-07-02 19:31:50 over 1000m/s less
general 2019-07-02 19:33:29 Thats all burns needed
general 2019-07-02 19:33:35 Going based off the dV map
general 2019-07-02 19:34:06 When I said 1000m/s I meant more like 500m/s lmao
general 2019-07-02 19:34:22 Minmus has lower gravity so oof
general 2019-07-02 19:35:29 I wonder if my SSTO could do a minmus mission
general 2019-07-02 20:07:50 Getting very top heavy assymetric loads into space is oof
general 2019-07-02 20:08:00 Aka this
general 2019-07-03 15:18:56 <@163143541160148992> Ngl making SSTOs with OPT parts is ez asf
general 2019-07-03 15:19:04 Since OPT parts have a very low weight for some reason
general 2019-07-03 16:57:37 I can't tell is that an atmospheric sensor or a ground sample thing lmao
general 2019-07-03 16:59:14 Ok yeah why did you take an atmospheric sensor to the mun
general 2019-07-08 21:58:07 I'm going to put my own twist on the BFR
general 2019-07-08 21:58:12 Except its going to be a lot smaller
general 2019-07-08 22:26:06 
general 2019-07-08 22:27:06 Payload didnt fit in the bay so I had to improvise
general 2019-07-08 22:28:54 I think that means fuel units/sec
general 2019-07-09 02:01:23 The parts are very low weight and have a crap ton of lift so probably lmao
general 2019-07-09 02:01:36 I've flown with just the body before
general 2019-07-09 03:20:52 SSTO to carry the SSTO?
general 2019-07-13 11:48:51 Im gonna try to make a tanker in KSP üòé
general 2019-07-13 11:50:39 That or some sort of aircraft to fuel my SSTO after takeoff
general 2019-07-13 13:08:15 You'd need to rendezvous said parts to it, assuming the satellite has docking ports
general 2019-07-14 10:31:17 ü§î
general 2019-07-14 10:31:39 Well that works
general 2019-07-14 10:49:13 Well the AI thought slamming my tanker into the ocean was a good idea
general 2019-07-14 10:50:26 And then it did this
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:59:35 <@!351809528209080324> The reason for the 2 rotors is so it doesnt spin lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:59:43 How did you screw up a tandem rotor
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:00:59 If it spins when you have a tandem rotor it has to do with weight pretty sure
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:01:10 Thats how it was when I was testing my tandem rotor
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:01:27 (those grey blocks are fuel btw)
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:01:27 
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:01:31 Not helium
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:01:54 I have very heavy ballasts right under the propellers
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:02:17 Figors, you don't
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:02:24 Thats the flaw with single prop planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:02:30 Both ingame and irl
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:02:45 Impecible is like
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:02:48 Noice
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:03:43 Basically means flawless in some sense
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:03:46 Perfect, etc etc
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:04:53 Ya yeet
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:06:36 The reason my heli was spinning was because it was back heavy at that time
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:12:13 Coaxial helis are big bad
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:12:20 Unless the heli is coaxial irl
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:30:05 What the fuck is this <@!224513422161739776>
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 12:30:19 No

plane-crazy 2019-07-15 12:11:48 Are you guys talking about PCs mc server lmao

plane-crazy 2019-07-15 12:13:16 Are hacks allowed or some crap lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 12:14:41 From what people are saying it seemed like they were lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-15 12:38:56 Are you using the mc dev texture pack?

general 2019-07-17 22:03:30 I mean theres fuccin Fortnite Monopoly, so why not Plane Crazy
general 2019-07-17 22:40:29 I feel like the stock mk2 might look the best on that
general 2019-07-17 22:45:25 With that TWR I'd imagine it'd be really tough to get anything into LKO
general 2019-07-20 18:42:29 Now thats hot
general 2019-07-29 23:51:14 I think I installed something wrong

creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:00:14 Formula Hover a new type of motorsport?
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:07:38 Its not exactly the best at turning sadly
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:12:03 Thats the thing, I think propellers would ruin the feel of it
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:21:30 Presentation is all too important when posting in creations
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:14 I spent like 10 mins getting a good angle for my Form Hover craft
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:47 Ok so
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:56 Making the hover drag to 0 makes it a lot easier to turn
