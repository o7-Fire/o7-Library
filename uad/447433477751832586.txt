plane-crazy 2021-04-24 21:25:26 Breaking plane crazy and going to speeds like mac 20, how nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:02:09 huh, getting VR done in plane crazy seems quite impossible from my pea-brain perspective..
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:02:24 considering i cant get a giant dorito ship thing fly normally
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:03:31 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:03:43 i have just made it fly *normally*, but still some bugs with it
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:04:01 and if i had image perms, id prob put it in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-04-24 22:31:24 I can barely see any of the literal creation in the picture..
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 22:34:54 doubt that doesnt use motor lock for atleast 10 different things
the-dump 2021-04-24 22:40:11 i cant tell what that thing is yet it feels cursed..
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 10:31:54 did he honestly think he'd get away with posting a HOF creation..
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 11:27:10 whats so funny about what i said?
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 11:27:30 gotta be lvl 3 with image role

plane-crazy 2021-04-25 11:29:19 just keep talking in the chats
general 2021-04-25 11:41:18 i prob should've kept my mouth shut then
general 2021-04-25 12:38:57 not so sure about that, apparently they got banned, and then unbanned few minutes later
general 2021-04-25 12:39:15 not even sure why they got unbanned
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 14:22:31 bruh
creations-chat 2021-04-25 16:57:54 i wonder how many people a day flex with tutorial builds, tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 19:11:00 damn, i wonder how many plots long it is, and i dont wanna know how many blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 19:21:29 pretty sure its an easter egg of sorts, but idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 19:21:57 also, depends on the current tail tip size i suppose
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 19:25:06 maybe sure then, but honestly better to take the opinion of someone more experienced then me
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 20:06:55 hopefully it'll be beautiful tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 20:06:59 id kiss that tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-25 20:07:57 ive already made a supremacy and star destroyer build, but i want to build another stupid SW ship thing, dunno what to make tho
bot-central 2021-04-26 08:48:44 !rank
creations-chat 2021-04-26 08:52:31 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y54Ef9FICCk yeah, pretty sure it is
creations-chat 2021-04-26 08:55:06 prob some of them think they can get away with it
general 2021-04-26 11:27:36 that is..
general 2021-04-26 11:27:45 a stupid yet hilarious reason to report someone
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 15:40:36 *shredder bug that intentionally pushes land builds and water builds off the map randomly exists*
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 15:41:04 well damn, can't fight that
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:42:51 likely wont be done unless rick gets a way to soft-code the game tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 17:43:01 also that^
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 07:48:42 hmm, i wonder how many people have made the star wars providence..
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 08:47:42 honestly, shredders are pretty bad if what you're using against it is small
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 08:48:01 they miss so often, and usually people have them so slow
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 21:51:54 big plane, with a bunch of damage on it, yet still has quite a few ways to balance, doubt it doesnt stop flying
the-dump 2021-05-24 14:10:25 just about everyone on discord when u consider it
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 18:57:43 i dont think the ground likes me..
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:34:39 could prob get u a good shipwright rank
general 2021-07-01 19:37:20 why is the lone trash can somewhat hilarious to me?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:43:04 what is it suppose to be?
creations-chat 2021-07-01 19:45:13 then prob try making it look a bit more accurate, add the side and top detail like ladders on the side
general 2021-07-01 19:53:23 damn, never tried rabbit, wonder how it does taste
general 2021-07-01 19:55:54 <#609442446249820211>  <#705941616199991307>  read the crap in those
creations-chat 2021-07-01 20:05:40 prob try changing the front of the turret area with triangle wedge blocks and triangle wedge
bug-reports 2021-07-01 20:13:21 deleted blocks when a build is still trying to render in does this
help 2021-07-01 20:44:07 if you mean the loud freaking sound that is sometimes played, its an reference that i dont really know about
bot-central 2021-07-01 20:53:59 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:09:40 if its a a10 warthog, then yeah, prob should make the wings shorter
