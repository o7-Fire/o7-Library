general 2021-12-15 02:06:23 So people can't make full transparent shredder bugs

bug-reports 2022-11-26 17:16:41 You can modify text without using the edit tool, due to of it being TextBoxes instead of TextLabels, it can't be seen by others, but it's kind of annoying since it also makes difficult to color text
