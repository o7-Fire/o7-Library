general 2021-11-21 13:44:43 Eh, whatever
general 2021-11-21 13:45:34 You're not gonna piss me off if you don't, so I don't care too much. It's just a good thing to put there I guess, so if people do care they can use it

creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:13:21 Testing with a scale made using a free-floating motor and a long symmetrical beam, the block with the disconnector plates seems to be heavier than the plateless block. I believe this may have something to do with how magnets themselves affect different blocks instead, since it's not always entirely consistent.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:38:21 Magnets do be funky
Among other things, they can be used for ECMs that can deflect tracking rockets fairly reliably, at least when moving at decent speed
help 2022-12-14 10:43:00 Yeah, in the tab with the gears, you'll find it by scrolling down a little
help 2022-12-14 10:45:19 Here.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:47:18 Well there's a certain type of magnet drive that will amplify magnet range and I believe strength too(unsure about that one), and for some reason once that has been activated once it can affect rockets even when the magnet isn't enabled in any direction

Hard to explain exactly, and on top of that I don't really want to end up leaking tech that could maybe cause chaos in the wrong hands

And no, it doesn't involve disconnectors
help 2022-12-14 10:48:52 No problem man, happy building üëã
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:54:38 Oh yikes, the physics lag lol
Uhh dunno what part of that involves said tech? What am I looking for in here-
Also I would post footage of the ECM tech in action, however I, a pesky whitename, do not have embed access outside of just a few channels. I can post the media link here in a bit maybe, but it won't be embedded
O wait what must've missed it since it looked uneventful so I was skipping through it. Where exactly in the video is that?
creations-chat 2022-12-14 10:58:49 Woah that's interesting
Oh yeah, here, if you want to see the ecm thing in action https://streamable.com/yl2kdi
Ofc it only works against tracking rockets, but it's pretty neat and useful nonetheless
creations-chat 2022-12-14 11:01:53 Nice nice
Well, good luck lol

if that doesn't work, you can try to put hover thrusters with drag in the thing. If you do that just make sure to lower their throttle to zero during setup

general 2022-12-14 12:49:16 h indeed
general 2022-12-14 12:50:45 No, there were winter events back then too, however at least the 2021 one was initiated fairly late

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:51:52 Studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:52:29 Normal blocks are 2x2x2 studs
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:53:17 Yeah that doesn't add up lol
I tend to count 1 stud as equal to 1ft since proportionally that's most appropriate for the avatars
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:53:39 However I remember that Roblox's official conversion was something absolutely stupid, lemme go find it
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:57:39 Searching for it online gives conflicting results, but I'm mostly seeing people either say 1ft like what I tend to count it as, or the seemingly official measurement of 20 studs being one meter

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 12:59:56 Ah, a shredder ball
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:01:20 I mean anything decent that can fly faster than 700-800 sps should be able to get it off of your tail if it chases you, then just attack the shredder when you get an opportunity and it's not targetting you
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:01:26 1 block is two studs
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:02:15 What speed did it reach on the speedometer?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:02:25 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:02:35 What kinda math did he use to arrive at that
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:02:44 studs per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:03:02 one block is two studs
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:03:55 Roblox length to irl length is uh, veery inconsistent to say the least.
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:04:16 Proportional to the avatars, 1 stud being 1ft makes the most sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:04:57 Then my 3.6k sps fighter reaches mach 20, totally makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:05:43 2ft legs, 2ft torso, 1ft head
5ft is decently close, especially considering how different robloxian proportions are from irl human proportions
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:06:12 And with a lot of rthro  avatars and such, this lines up a little closer with 5-6ft
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:08:08 ***Baaasically, the take-away from all of this is that converting measurements in Roblox to measurements irl is a stupid idea***
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:08:34 nah bro a block is 493872q08623096 studs
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:08:42 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:10:31 Exactly, proportionally it makes the most sense

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:12:10 per second
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:13:41 We don't, there's no way to truly prove roblox to irl length
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:13:56 However, it fits best proportionally with roblox avatars
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:14:13 Since the length of their feet is literally 1 stud
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:14:48 And since 1ft is supposed to be, well, a foot's length, 1 stud would proportionally fit as being 1ft
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:15:31 Looks good üëç
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 13:16:59 Cam locking can sometimes be better for cleanliness, but both do the job well enough

plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:00:40 I don't have much outside of 1x1 nose stuff, but uh here's a smooth F-35C cockpit that I'll have to try and shorten slightly later
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:03:22 Yeah. Sometimes it's tricky to get working the way you may want it, but the results can be very good
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:07:08 Very precise angle locking, is my guess
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:08:51 Ey thanks
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:09:48 Yeah I've shelved it briefly since some other interesting stuff popped up for me to mess with, on top of me slowly getting tired of working on it due to how it can get frustrating trying to get the cam locks to work just right
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:19:24 I mean, everyone has to start somewhere, correct? I recommend you try to find a chill PC community where you can put your stuff up and make sure you'll be getting constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 14:19:50 Knowing what to improve, and getting ideas on how to do that from others, is key to improving I'd say

plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:02:58 At least, it *is* changing
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:04:20 Can't wait to try and find counters or to just out-play toxic noob ANO's with either a good ol' jet or with a hover gyro/axis lock mix gunship
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:05:49 ~~Just bop their gyro, most of my builds have good low speed control so I'll just lure them down to like 250 sps max, then take shots <:trol:903469871042531398>~~
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:06:37 Ez indeed, you've probably seen my gunship racing drone thing in WL so uhh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:07:04 And since it's stable *with turrets*, I can pretty easily just point and shoot <:Troll:1057983853777670145>
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:07:47 Alr, though the tech is already leaked so whatever
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:08:11 And from a pure performance standpoint it's nowhere near ANO level, even if it can stand a chance when used right
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 09:08:16 Hmm fair and valid
general 2023-03-20 09:11:57 It's still gonna cause ghost hits since those client side bullets will still be a thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 12:58:54 It *can* be configured to carry certain GBU's iirc, however yes, the F-22 is pretty much purely built for air superiority.
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 13:01:17 The F-35 variants are all fully multirole, and put more emphasis on avionics and such rather than how the F-22 mostly focuses on raw performance, albeit with a fair bit of good avionics thrown in as well
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 13:13:20 Yeah true
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 13:14:20 Oh yeah true
Bet it still runs mostly on stuff closer to when it was first produced, though I wouldn't be surprised if at least some of the stuff from the F-35 program was brought over to improve the F-22
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 13:18:06 guh

plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:06:11 guh
what did you find
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:07:08 I mean good luck hitting something like this tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:08:22 Bruh that thing is uh, not exactly nimble to say the least
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:08:37 Yeah, that's no breakthrough
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:09:00 Tbh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:09:31 Ehhh look into stuff like jets or spaceships for aerial pvp instead I'd say
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:09:39 Maybe gunships or helis if that's your thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:09:59 Eh fair
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:10:29 btw rate yesyes
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:11:03 Uhh if the hovers are in the back then increase drag, though I wouldn't go above 10 per hover thruster tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:11:18 If it's in the front then it'll just ruin stability
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:12:03 Though pitch-wise that thing is already overly stable, and you can probably move the center of lift/drag further forward by a tiny bit on that front
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:13:44 To get stability I'd honestly instead use fabric wing panels. Two 1x1's in the front, one vertical one horizontal, is usually enough to improve stability a fair bit for 1x1 nose pvp jets. Effect varies based on design of the aircraft, ofc
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:15:55 Nicenice
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 11:17:03 guh, oh right I need to keep working on this thing too

plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:46:10 Blocks are 2.5 studs in each direction in-game, and proportionally speaking 1 stud should be 1ft, making it 5.6 blocks
Official roblox measurements are pretty scuffed tho, lemme go find them
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:47:29 According to roblox, 1 stud is 5cm, which is just shy of 0.5ft. By this measurement, 14ft would be ~34 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:48:05 Uh
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:48:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:48:08 <:Thumsup:907037055656288266>
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:49:01 I did the math and it'd be 5.6, but yeah close enough
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:49:08 Yeah scale is important too
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:49:44 And yes I was proposing that scale, since Roblox's official scale conversion is absolutely stupid
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:50:15 20 studs for 1m? Like bruuu <a:Sku:1051967468131852318>
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:51:18 Well, 5 studs is 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:51:33 But yes if you're not as high as Roblox was when making their measurements
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:51:38 then 2 blocks is 5ft
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:55:15 1.6, but 1.5 is close enough I'd say
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:58:02 Trapdoors are slightly shorter actually, that might be closer to 0.1 studs? Idunno
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:58:17 no wait .1 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 12:59:41 Indeed. It's 5 cm.
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:00:10 Bru
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:00:32 0.125 meters, or 12.5 cm
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:00:43 According to Roblox's stupid official measurements
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:01:50 OR, just use the more logical, proportional 1 stud = 1ft, then the default robloxian is also 5ft, which gets them close enough to normal levels anyway, while also having 1 stud, actually be the length of a robloxian foot :>>>
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:02:04 Wowww, works so much better and is so much simpler that way huh?
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:02:23 I mean neither is your 2.5 studs = 0.7m
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:02:53 Ah yes, because he decides the official length for a stud
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:02:56 <:Thumsup:907037055656288266>
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:03:31 The official length is 5cm.
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:07:06 https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-many-studs-is-there-in-a-meter/103417/30
https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Studs
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:08:29 Sources here, seems to be 0.28m per stud then? Huh. Alright guess you're right, I'll still be using 1stud = 1ft because it works more intuitively
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:08:48 I was just about to say so, however to add on, *to just agree to disagree.*
plane-crazy 2023-03-29 13:16:01 https://web.archive.org/web/20120610233114/https://blog.roblox.com/2012/06/testing-the-accuracy-of-roblox-physics-with-potato-cannons/ Actually waiiit, the measurement of 20 studs per 1m seems to hold ground at least from way back in the day. Not arguing for it nowadays, but I found this looking around and thought it was worth sharing out of fascination. They got the number from how they had to multiply to get proportionally correct acceleration when it came to default gravity.

general 2023-04-04 08:27:06 My name in this server is coloured white, therefore I must complain about motor 2's being broken again !!! üò§üò§
general 2023-04-04 08:35:50 Ehhh wouldn't say I'd go out of my way for it. Whichever way it's not like anyone else I've talked to on here has cared about it, not like there's a good reason for people to care about what pfp I'm using anyway <:Cocky:1011499531650748487>

general 2023-04-14 07:43:55 A better question would be why you're spreading lies about me. All those screenshots you've sent of chat messages I've allegedly sent are faked using inspect element. If you wanna prove they're not, then by all means show me where to find them.
general 2023-04-14 07:44:51 That's gonna be a big fat 0, don't believe everything you hear said about people, just sayin.
general 2023-04-14 07:46:14 Hmmyes 3 years ago when I was still a minor. Whichever way why even bring that up
