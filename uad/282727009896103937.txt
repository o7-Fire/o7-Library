creations-chat 2020-08-30 12:47:53 yea
bot-central 2020-09-25 06:18:17 Oh
bot-central 2020-09-25 06:19:19 -mapsuggest make the new train tracks that will be in the map have wider turns so trains can go around them more smoothly and won’t stop going around the turn halfway and also so people’s trains who are really fast won’t fly off the tracks when going around them. And it will also make them more realistic looking to actual rails.
bot-central 2020-09-25 06:19:24 🙂
