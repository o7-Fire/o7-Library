bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:25:24 I have anchor blocks on my submarine, and it starts flinging even before I can fold it (it happens sometimes, not all the time but really often)
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:07 
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:17 I meant that it's flinging even if I have anchor on, the motors probably screw everything up
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:29 Because it breaks only in the motor places
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:41 lol
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:29:41 in conclusion, fix motors pls
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:13 Oh
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:20 Okay thanks for the tip I'll try that
bug-reports 2021-03-20 13:56:31 Thanks mate
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:04:02 Nope it's even worse
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:04:19 it lags and when I try to fold it, it folds a bit and then unfolds again
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:05:36 Yes
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:05:45 I selected lock and it's even worse
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:25 I mean, it folds
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:28 but when I try to open silos
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:35 they open like 45 degrees
bug-reports 2021-03-20 14:06:38 and slam shut again
