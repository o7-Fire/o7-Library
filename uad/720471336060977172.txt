plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:04:32 did they do something to the physics in plane crazy? me and my buddy havent played in probably 8 months, and we just came back and all of our jets handle terrible, the motors get stuck in place, and the motors will turn in ways theyre not even supposed to turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:05:17 how does that even happen lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:05:53 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:06:25 well yeah, but i just dont see how it broke randomly. im not saying youre lying, it just seems weird. kinda unfortunate too
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:06:35 because pretty much all my builds use motors
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 22:10:09 pfffft, lameeee
