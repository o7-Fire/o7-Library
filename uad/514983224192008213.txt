creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:26 questionable flying machines
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:29 so they are creations
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:53 i think you are implying that all creations need to be super pretty and realistic
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:56 but those are called replicas
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:34:33 alright
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:10 
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:23 alright, let's say that's a boeing
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:31 this is a boeing replica
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:36 the first one was a creation
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:40 the second one was a replica
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:35:43 ***get it?***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:09 wait, can balls count as bombs?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:36:58 i know
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:37:05 i'm not saying it's mine
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:37:09 ***example***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:37:51 ***wait, helium blocks make stuff float, right?***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:38:04 (:
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:38:26 Flame, are you implying that the stuff I posted earlier did not count as 'creations'?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:38:39 well, except for the 'bomb' of course
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:33 well, that's better than nothing
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:55 well, that was my attempt at getting the Bombardier rank
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:00 but i have something better on my mind now
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:29 What is that
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:56 Ah
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:41:02 Yes, yes, I see it in the air uhh
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:41:05 uhh

creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:43:16 well,
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:43:38 from the design, i can see the jet engines/rocket engines positioned at the tips of the wings
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:43:47 which will make the plane spin in while it flies
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:44 ***oh right***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:00 they should make it possible to edit the speed of wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:12 so your 4-wheel car doesn't reach the speed of light
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:54 i had a tank with 4 wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:56 well, i call it a tank
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:59 it wasn't one really
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:34 well, from what i have tested
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:50 the vehicle needs to be way too bulky
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:51 and bi
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:53 and big
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:55 to actualyl go slow
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:58 with multiple wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:47:03 ***what are those***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:49:09 i dont think the beginner guide helped me
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:49:59 fair enough
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:04 don't call me John tho
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:07 call me Bacon
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:16 i'm more used to it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:19 don't ask why
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:42 I literally used a fake name generator
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:48 because I'm bad at making good usernames
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:51:10 and then for the numbers at the front, I counted the amount of letters in John and Hegwood
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:56:12 hell, nobody in my server knows what ballasts are
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 23:56:20 can someone tell me their use/function?

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:53:25 holy moly
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:53:33 i think i just made my first working zeppelin
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:54:02 i used helium blocks and jet engines, and i think that if i only used jet engines it would have worked better
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:55:48 we need wedge beams
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:59:31 My first zeppelin! It's filled with helium blocks that make it float, and then I placed jets inside of it to change it's height and speed. If I'm right, I should get the Advanced Engineer rank.
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:59:45 
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:03:15

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:12:57 don't i deserve the Advanced ENgineer role?
I mean, I did make a vehicle that only uses helium to stay afloat, and uses engines to steer
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:13:14 and it is over 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:13:26 and i just found out how useful on/off is

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:15:00 inside the balloon thingy, there is a bunch of helium blocks and jets that make it possible for me to steer it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:15:08 isn't that all I need for advanced engineer
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:15:36 the helium makes the thing float
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:15:56 yo, I request the Advanced Engineer role
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:16:35 cmon, i deserve it

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:50:21 well, trap doors are normal doors
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:50:28 it's just a block you can go through
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:50:44 of course, a scripter can make one that opens for you to walk through
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:50:50 but they were too lazy to make it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:54:21 how can I make a block uncollidable?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:55:38 ingame
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:55:48 what
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:05 Farollo had drop pods, that you could enter from behind
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:14 and there was a block there, and it was non-collidable
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:41 no, i mean, there was like a whole wall/side of the drop pod
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:46 that was uncollidable
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:54 and you could walk throguh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:56:56 lmao today
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:57:13 trapdoors aren't even full blocks
