general 2020-08-05 12:05:38 J
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:05:50 Ya
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:06:59 I have a suggestion of adding a new settings for TNT blocks and that is explode on impact that instantly explode when touching other players blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:09:41 Nope it can explode if it drop from a high enough altitude
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:09:52 This setting only explode when touching other players
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:10:02 It probably making bomber a lot more powerful tho

plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:31:37 Ahh I made a tiny suspension system and I donâ€™t even have an idea of how to fit it into my build
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:00 without tutorial i will not know that if you unpower a motor it make it move freely
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:23 "tutorial" as you higher being call it
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:41 turtorial/guide suppose to teach you something
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:45 not just copying it
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:38:21 we have no idea how the ingame mechanic work you expect people with limited playtime and time to play to have the same level as you with like 20 days playtime?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:38:42 like bruh if that the case everyone in the server will have abram tank and fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:39:11 he eat potato for breakfast

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:40:02 i spent a good 5 hours just to understand the heli mechanic

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:44:31 People need "guide" and "tutorial" to understand the mechanic better i spent 5 hours just learning how the god damn heli mechanic work and another 2 hours just making the suspension system you expecting people have that much patience as you?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:44:45 if they just straight up copying it that a different story
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:45:48 So you're saying that all people who watch "tutorial" and "Guide" are brain dead copying the build
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:46:35 welp this chat brainhurt im tabbing away
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:48:04 people dont have time for that they just use it boost their knowledge about the mechanic
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:48:51 i have tried to stay away from tutorial because ik OG like you gonna bash us with no imagination no effort and just copycat
