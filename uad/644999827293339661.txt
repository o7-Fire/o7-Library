general 2020-08-30 14:32:23 Hey guys
general 2020-08-30 14:35:01 I want to hear your opinion about this.
Today I visited the RepTár 
Aircraft, Helicopter & Artillery Museum in Szolnok, Hungary.
Many exhibits, two were stuck in my mind: the Aero-45 Osprey (a twin-engine passenger plane built in Czechoslovakia in the 60s) and a Bf 108 Taifun (built post-war in France).
I wanted to ask you guys over which one shoud I try to build in Plane Crazy.
general 2020-08-30 14:36:07 København=Koppenhagen?
general 2020-08-30 14:36:31 So, Bf 108 or Aero-45?
general 2020-08-30 14:37:02 Honestly, the Osprey looks like a smallened He-111
general 2020-08-30 14:37:14 I can send a pic if u want
general 2020-08-30 14:37:22 Of both planes i took today.
general 2020-08-30 14:37:30 Okay..
general 2020-08-30 14:38:04 Is it ok if i send the pics into this channel
general 2020-08-30 14:38:38 
general 2020-08-30 14:39:15 
general 2020-08-30 14:39:23 Guess which is which
general 2020-08-30 14:39:27 Try it
general 2020-08-30 14:39:47 So, this is what I need you to vote on.
general 2020-08-30 14:39:55 > first one osprey second bf 108
<@324274557965959172> correct
general 2020-08-30 14:40:15 Which should i try 2 build in plane crazy?
general 2020-08-30 14:40:44 (I like to buils in scale, probly the 108 would be harder)
general 2020-08-30 14:40:54 The 108 is not a fighter technicly.
general 2020-08-30 14:41:03 Its a mail delivery plane.
general 2020-08-30 14:41:13 Also touist plane.
general 2020-08-30 14:41:31 While the Aer-45 is simular
general 2020-08-30 14:41:39 Okayy.
general 2020-08-30 14:41:53 If you want you can join on me
general 2020-08-30 14:42:02 Usernames' same as here.
general 2020-08-30 14:42:31 So, Aero-45?
general 2020-08-30 14:42:37 Anything to add?
general 2020-08-30 14:42:41 Anyone?
general 2020-08-30 14:42:59 Okay, so winner is AERO-45 OSPREY.
general 2020-08-30 14:43:40 Ill see you guys in the creations tab. Or roblox server if you want to see me try (and possibly fail) building one.
general 2020-08-30 14:45:49 Also one thing
general 2020-08-30 14:46:07 Should i use my own pics only or am i allowed to search on googel
general 2020-08-30 14:46:33 I feel if do i will do it better
general 2020-08-30 14:46:45 Since i didn't take pics of the tail
general 2020-08-30 14:47:20 I searxhes it on google
general 2020-08-30 14:47:26 The first i see is a vid
general 2020-08-30 14:47:34 FROM THE SAME MUSEUM.
general 2020-08-30 14:47:40 that i visited
general 2020-08-30 14:48:03 Also
general 2020-08-30 14:48:19 If its a bit blocky or looks crap thats cause i try to use roblox scale.
general 2020-08-30 14:48:59 And u know how limited your smollest scale block is at that scale
general 2020-08-30 15:23:25 anyways Aero-45 livestream
general 2020-08-30 15:23:49 i have been delayed cause a guy tried threatening to report me to the police
general 2020-08-30 15:23:56 i assume the guy is American
general 2020-08-30 15:24:13 because he's boiling his brain over being shown on DC livestream
general 2020-08-30 15:24:21 which most likely no1 will ever see.
general 2020-08-30 15:29:38 that describes how i feel
general 2020-08-30 15:29:46 when i get into an argument with an american
general 2020-08-30 15:30:14 like literally
general 2020-08-30 15:45:31 so, i think im done with the prototype
general 2020-08-30 15:45:56 i took a screenshot of it, ill send it in the creations channel, it still needs some refining but the base build is done.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:46:32 still needs some refinement
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:48:13 better now? what do you think?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:49:37 well i am trying to seek opinions over this Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:49:46 its REALLY hard to do at the scale i am building it.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:56:21 guess seaking opinions and feedback is useless because everyones judging based off a biased opinion
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:56:49 if i did that every pic i saw i would dislike instantly.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:35 i was trying to ask opinions about the front
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:46 this plane is so darn hard to build
creations-chat 2020-08-30 15:59:48 like legit
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:02 its taken me like 15 mins already
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:21 Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:00:46 czechoslovak mail delivery and joyrides plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:01:47 nah
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:17 originally i asked the guy in <#497142796961054721> to vote over the Aero-45 and Me 108 Taifun
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:22 they said Aero
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:02:37 i probly should have tried the Me 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:03:49 is it a problem if i send in a pic of both
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:27 maybe this channel
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:32 dont think that would work but maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:04:45 anyways imma try the 108 then
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:13 bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:15 SO EZ
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:19 its like a bf 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:28 but its a tourist and mail delivery plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:05:37 that is literally the 109's big older bro
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:32 its not a bf 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:36 its a bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:41 oh.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:06:50 well, the differences are that the
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:05 108 can fit 3 people pilot not included in that number
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:10 its slower.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:35 also it was manufactured in france after the war
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:07:48 and used by them until the late 60s
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:08:58 im not that skilled.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:07 i have built like a decent number of stuff but
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:16 never above the roblox character size scale
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:09:22 (which i take as a basis)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:37 can i ask a question
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:48 does leaving a block distance between seats worth it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:11:54 in like TINY builds?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:09 does look better or is more space worth it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:18 austetic or more space
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:20 okay.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:12:30 ill build the cabin of the 108 that way then.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:05 im about to be a big brain
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:19 im gonna use signs instead of half blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:27 harder to use but look more realistic
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:13:41 also allows me to leave hidden stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:15:07 im putting funny quotes onto the sides
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:15:09 like
creations-chat 2020-08-30 16:15:15 "Where's my altitude?"

creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:31 i have more i believe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:41 aircraft that are next to inpossible to make
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:27:49 for example i tried to make the Aero-45
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:00 its a czechoslovak twin-engine passenger plane
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:30 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:29:14 or try to make
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:29:17 a...
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:08 Try 2 build 1 of these
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:29 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:30:37 here are some moar anglez
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:06 also if you look at the tails and fuselages you may see something weird
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:36 for example the second latest pic i posted
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:42 you can't read the writing
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:31:45 can you
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:08 wdym
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:40 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:32:53 thought about the way prop blades are angled
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:01 but thats gotta be obvius
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:11 btw i made a Bf 108
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:20 doesn't look the best but for what tech i used
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:31 it looks quite realistic in my op
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:41 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:33:53 from this angle its a bit weird i can imagine
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:08 but in game it looks way better
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:19 like everything else does
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:41 i used signs for the passenger cabin parts
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:34:51 and half slabs to attach wings
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:02 however i made the wing look a bit weird
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:21 because there isn't a solid block between the wing and the passenger seats
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:27 meaning theres a hole
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:44 > The 108 is long
<@!393679134779375616> there isn't a 1x7 wedge sadly
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:35:56 although i wish there was
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:09 nor 1x7 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:23 seriusly these 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 wedges aren't enough are they
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:42 dry
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:48 that plane is VERY small.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:36:54 despite how big it looks in the pic.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:04 the fuselage is just 3 blocks wide
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:24 unlike maybe my F-13 that has a width of 5 blocks at the passenger compartment
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:50 3 block wide?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:37:58 INCLUDING THE WINGS?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:07 i was talking about the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:14 otherwise if you include wingspan
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:19 its about 11 blocks or so
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:32 so its quite a wide one
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:50 well
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:38:58 at the size of the plane i got
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:18 i probly won't be able to do any of those building hax that u can do in bigger builds
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:29 like maybe the tutorial P40 as an example
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:43 i wanted to not use rockets here
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:39:56 otherwise it uses a 3 blade radial
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:04 because the 2 blade wasn't powerful enough
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:13 and there isn't an in-line engine in the game.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:40:28 davreen, i like that ship in the background too
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:41:48 that bf 108 isn't large at all
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:41:59 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:42:03

creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:59:12 how does it look? still pretty bad i believe
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:59:38 bf 108 copycat
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:07 yea the long nose is a good point ngl
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:25 well
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:30 if you look at it sideways
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:36 it makes it a bit flatter
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:00:57 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:02:14 any nein lives jokes?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:03:12

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:04:48 i don't see a point
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:02 well, i have a Pe-8
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:07 isn't the prettiest
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:13 but it works?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:16 i guess
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:32 it can carry 7 bombs that are mounted in a line
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:05:44 my Pe-8's features:
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:06:27 8 bombs, only props, the ability to fly as slow as hell, 4 self-defense MGs (COMPLETELY USELESS), a non-realistic camo i designed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:06:34 and 'flaps'
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:19 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:22 heres that Pe-8 of mine
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:26 guys
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:07:33 is it an issue if i self-downvote?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:33 well, i mainly build my planes to the scale of the roblox character, so i can't really fit anything large into them.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:43 still can be pretty cool tho.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:08:49 for example that F-13
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:09:46 commit Junkers-F13
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:10:03 looks bad does it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:10:38 because i can't build them to look so detailed

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:15:47 this is CURSED.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:15:53 its meant to be
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:16:05 a fast and stable plane that turns well at high speed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:16:17 that can carry a lot of stuff and be very survivable
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:16:24 that design IS TWO YEARS OLD.

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:20:24 this one is meant to be a Ju 87
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:20:30 its pretty cursed tho too.

creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:28:43 i need some time to send them+more stuffg i need to do before i do that
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:06 here comes the first 3
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:14 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:22 the first plane i downloaded was the one at the top
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:29:54 what i did was downloaded a Ju 87, then modified it so suit my own needs and published it so i can access it anywhere with my acc
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:06 some are great, some are cursed
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:17 the bottom one is a P45 attempt that FAILED.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:24 the middle is a small Me 262
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:34 its so small i would consider it a model.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:51 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:30:51 guess.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:06 a G.91YS, an F-13 and a Me 109
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:15 all three are 100% my own.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:25 commit NO wedges.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:30 commit PLYWOOD.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:31:58 the devs added a new material called "wood 3" which is basicly an armored wood type
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:03 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:21 in SM you don't need wedges because of how small an individual block is
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:36 its like a 1/1000 compared to what we have in PC
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:32:45 its like a 1000 times smoller
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:02 heres the last two
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:07 
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:23 one is a Potez 631. the other is my attempt of a Ju 87
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:41 one issue with SM
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:50 is that when u save something on your lift
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:33:57 everything is default.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:34:22 meaning that even if your wings ARE angled backwards, when uploaded, they will show straight.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:35:42 this applies to everything such as pistons, suspension, bearings, even logic parts like lamps (which by default, shine), logic gates, timers, etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:35:57 btw, i tried to make an AeroTrain in SM
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:04 (the GM Aerotrain from 1955)
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:30 it went very well, you can even drive it
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:36:54 one issue is that the terrain assets that form tracks in the game aren't avaible due to the survival update.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:37:17 meaning that any train we make has to be able to drive on the ground, or be static.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:37:40 this one i made so it can move around without tracks but can also be converted to rail use.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:11 i made it so theres an individual engine, passenger cars, and a default, two passenger car train set.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:21 as wiring the cars takes time.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:38:42 also, large creations in SM get laggy REAL QUICK.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:39:09 you wanna see that as well?
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:39:36 SM isn't very bad at graphics, allthough it does need a powerful computer to run with 120 FPS
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:00 as even with minimum graphics, the larger a creation is more lag will happen.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:08 because of calculating physics.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 18:40:29 this is why you don't see semi-trucks with detachable trailers often.
creations-chat 2020-09-01 20:01:03 Heyy
creations-chat 2020-09-01 20:02:39 That SS Atlantic looks cool

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:17 
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:42 if you look at pic 1 you may notice that the rudder is not made out of ctrl surfaces
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:08:54 basicly, ITS A DRIFT MACHINE
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:09:34 drift machine

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:11:39 for me its black if i open it in mp4 viewer
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:11:58 guess a wmv file would be even worse
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:12:05 would it be tho idk
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:13:01 lets see how many downvotes this plane would get
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:14:03 lol its actually getting upvoted
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:14:19 i built it literally today and there are some issues

creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:55 "-Why is the Protoss Air Force great?
Because it is Corsair-u."?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:34 The thing is corsair with a ű on the end sounds exactly like "korszerű" which is Hungarian for modern
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:46 Thats the joke
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:10 Agreed
general 2020-09-12 11:52:43 Hey guys
general 2020-09-12 11:52:54 Wanna hear a joke you don't understand?
general 2020-09-12 11:53:18 Its an air force joke
general 2020-09-28 20:20:04 Hi guys
general 2020-09-28 20:20:48 In the game "Horrible Housing" theres a death message "xyz broke their charger."
general 2020-09-28 20:20:53 I like to say
general 2020-09-28 20:21:23 "You underestimate how many chargers I have broken in 6 years of having a phone!"

general 2020-09-28 20:25:44 Lets see if theres anything notable besides that very good looking 'Ikea'
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:23:41 sanic boat
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:04 dat speed tho
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:25 a smal speedboat
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:24:43 that looks real bad but its sanic
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:25:08 i make bad looking boats that can go really fast
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:26:28 idk
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:26:48 im a man of culture: look
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:27:20 Peeps of culture dislike their own thing
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:27:37 so i shall dislike this other one:
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:28:14 
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:28:30 its supposed to be a de havilland 89 but it sucks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:29:55 well
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:30:12 it is a way to increase speed to use ctrl surfs as wings
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:30:30 instead of having wider wings isnt it?
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:31:16 i also made a bomber version that drops bombs, has a different paint scheme and a different line
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:31:47 but because roblox doesn't let me write that certain word into that sign
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:32:03 i have to write 'pales drop' instead of the actual word.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:32:40 (note that the word "pales" is meant to refer for a kind of drink that is popular the country i live in as a joke referring to the plane being british)
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:33:20 as i originally wrote tea drop on it
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:33:41 but since i changed it to be Hungarian, i had to change the word tea.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:38:20 lol who upvoted that DH89
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:39:16 its not wide its T H I C C

creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:39:53 no u
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:40:13 its extra thick thats why its T H I C C
creations-chat 2020-10-02 18:40:35 cursed by design

creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:26:03 what
creations-chat 2020-10-20 16:27:17 a bad Polikarpov-2
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:55:43 ive downloaded one, then made a plane that can be seen in the pic and repainted it
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:57:16 original
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:58:29 current
creations-chat 2020-10-31 09:59:52 what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:01:08 welp, the angle makes it hard to see what it actually is.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:02:51 btw, do you have any ideas on what its meant to be like say a Ju 87? or if it is custom built? fancy a guess?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:04:50 i'd say its some kind of dive bomber (Ju 87 or Dauntless)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:06:27 currently:
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:12:27 btw, ill see what i can do to get the maximum potential out of that plane
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:14:13 okay, this plane (rn) carries 2 bombs, 2 mgs and two fireworks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:26:38 the cake is a lie then yes
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:39:12 
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:42:19 bruh clampa's yamato then, it is the same build from different angles in both cases
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:47:58 what keyboard do you have? english?
creations-chat 2020-10-31 10:50:08 okay. mine is hungarian, i have a separate key for that. i believe french keyboards do, too.
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:06:48 whats a mistake i made: joining this server as someone who prefers practicality over looks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:07:57 lengthen it jacob
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:08:59 is it just me or does this community not like practical builds over looks
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:10:10 > RobertoHun1 why not both
<@!476629966780497931> ivan, i build in a smaller scale than most (sized around the roblox character)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:12:38 heres a tip: download the image, open it with an image editor (say paint for exampel), as its possible to the same shade with paint (thats how i made camoflague paint some months ago)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:15:07 @Blytt i think the red part (idk what its called) could be a bit longer (also imma build the Austro-Hungarian copy of this)
creations-chat 2020-10-31 11:17:06 the IRL copy. SMS Leitha. (built in 1871)

creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:43:04 i like asking for opinions
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:44:56 i wanted a realistic turret but due to physics, either gun elevation or a good looking turret, and frankly, gun elevation is a better investment for me
creations-chat 2020-10-31 13:46:35 probably due to the bad angle of the screenshot, i assume. ill make sum more screenshots from different angles later.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 18:22:16 guys i believe someone lost their flak gun

general 2020-12-18 11:56:28 "Peasants with a heavy load
Theyre all VC when the bombs explode
Napalm sticks to kids!"
general 2020-12-18 11:57:40 "Oxcarts rolling down the road
Peasants with a heavy load
Theyre all VC when the bombs explode
Napalm sticks to kids!"
general 2020-12-18 11:57:42 There we go
general 2020-12-18 11:58:32 Wait what?
general 2020-12-18 11:58:55 Mind if I ask
general 2020-12-18 11:58:59 Who he is?
general 2020-12-18 11:59:17 And how a youtuber being 'better' than PewDiePie is possible?
general 2020-12-18 11:59:26 Just for the comedic effect?
general 2020-12-18 11:59:55 I was only joking.
general 2020-12-18 12:00:02 With the second one.
general 2020-12-18 12:00:24 When i asked "'better' than pewdiepie" i was only joking
general 2020-12-18 12:00:36 Ultra, if that is the case
general 2020-12-18 12:00:46 I may as well check him out rn
general 2020-12-18 12:01:49 > my pc when  im installing a game : BRRRRRR 
Ikr?
general 2020-12-18 12:02:00 Sorry for the ping
general 2020-12-18 12:02:09 But there isnt an answer option sadly.
general 2020-12-18 12:02:26 reply*
general 2020-12-18 12:02:54 Ive removed the ping.
general 2020-12-18 12:03:06 It still highlights that message for you i assume?
general 2020-12-18 12:03:26 If it does, ill remove it
general 2020-12-18 12:05:10 Reptile, is it in creations
general 2020-12-24 10:59:59 Guys,
general 2020-12-24 11:00:17 Am i the only one having issues with the shift button rn
general 2020-12-24 11:00:31 I'm pressing it, but my character cant run
general 2020-12-24 11:00:48 Also, i cant click on the gearwheels button
general 2020-12-24 11:02:06 Depends on what you mean by better.
general 2020-12-24 11:02:45 Faster? More engines.
Better stability? More wings.
Better manouverability? 
More CTRL surfaces.
general 2020-12-24 11:03:01 Problem is, you can only have two at the same time.
general 2020-12-24 11:03:20 bruh
general 2020-12-24 11:03:36 Not every aircraft has the space for custom control surfaces.
general 2020-12-24 11:05:31 As i was saying
general 2020-12-24 11:05:52 You cant have more than two at the same time
general 2020-12-24 11:06:05 Speed counteracts stability.
general 2020-12-24 11:06:11 So does manouverability.
general 2020-12-24 11:06:31 Except, there is a very specific design that has all 3 at the same time.
general 2020-12-24 11:07:01 I may be a bit.
general 2020-12-24 11:07:25 This design is super rare, I'm the only guy using it as of ik
general 2020-12-24 11:07:41 Ppl hate it. They call it flying carpet
general 2020-12-24 11:07:49 and many other names
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:22:51 I'm trying to run/click on the settings tab, but neither works.
bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:23:09 I have video footage, it is converting to Mp4 rn.

bug-reports 2020-12-24 11:31:39 im trying to upload it, but the wifi isn't helping at all
general 2020-12-28 07:22:31 Good [timezone based time]
general 2020-12-28 07:22:39 What is up the ladder today?
general 2020-12-28 07:23:01 *click* nice
general 2020-12-28 07:23:30 I tried to click my mouth yesterday to sound like the meme
general 2020-12-28 07:23:50 and my mouth broke
general 2020-12-28 07:24:01 it wasnt bleeding or anything
general 2020-12-28 07:24:08 It didn't click
general 2020-12-28 07:24:25 oh boi
general 2020-12-28 07:24:42 repost someone elses creation
general 2020-12-28 07:24:48 For example
general 2020-12-28 07:24:53 And claim it as yours
general 2020-12-28 07:25:28 For example, if i were to build madvulcans B-25, them post it in creations as mine, that would be rulebreaking
general 2020-12-28 07:26:02 Which, I did copy it, but modified some stuff in the inside
general 2020-12-28 07:26:32 And i messed up the engines, totally different wings, so it could as well count
general 2020-12-28 07:26:50 its not the
general 2020-12-28 07:26:56 "To Battle"
general 2020-12-28 07:27:06 its "Ruin Battle"
general 2020-12-28 07:27:34 0 golden eagles haha
general 2020-12-28 07:27:39 to be fair
general 2020-12-28 07:27:56 me saying that as someone who doesnt even play wt is not fair
general 2020-12-28 07:28:15 Guess im lucky im not in that hellhole of a game
general 2020-12-28 07:28:43 4 am?
general 2020-12-28 07:28:57 I gotta account for the timezones
general 2020-12-28 07:29:03 Mate

general 2020-12-28 07:29:20 Its 8:29 here
general 2020-12-28 07:29:29 Yes
general 2020-12-28 07:29:47 Half past 9 i think its called
general 2020-12-28 07:29:55 Ive never used the "half past"
general 2020-12-28 07:30:00 Just the time and am
general 2020-12-28 07:30:19 Its not nsfw
general 2020-12-28 07:30:25 Just cringe
general 2020-12-28 07:30:46 If it doesnt show gore/p content, it isnt nsfw
general 2020-12-28 07:31:18 do you know what is definitely SFW?
general 2020-12-28 07:31:29 your maths homework
general 2020-12-28 07:31:36 Jk
general 2020-12-28 07:31:50 Jk Homework is NSFW
general 2020-12-28 07:32:16 Homework is not safe for work if you take corona into account
general 2020-12-28 07:32:30 Actually
general 2020-12-28 07:32:51 Saying that is like saying every machine is a smoke machine if you operate it wrong enough
general 2020-12-28 07:33:12 Wait thats human?
general 2020-12-28 07:33:22 Thats human flesh right there?
general 2020-12-28 07:33:33 Im gonna have to declare that NSFW
general 2020-12-28 07:33:56 Also ill ping myself as well
general 2020-12-28 07:34:04 @RobertoHun1
general 2020-12-28 07:34:23 *massive amounts of bruh*
general 2020-12-28 07:34:55 Okay thats nsfw for sure
general 2020-12-28 07:35:41 Australia
general 2020-12-28 07:35:48 Probably
general 2021-01-01 21:07:11 Prepare for a joke
general 2021-01-01 21:07:18 Whats flying today?
general 2021-01-01 21:07:31 Aircraft
general 2021-01-01 21:07:59 Nvm this one sucked
general 2021-01-01 21:08:45 Wrong channel also i assume
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:06:13 could someone send me a pic of what moe built that got rko'd? Im curious
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:08:20 Also i saw a bf109 and holy  that looked very good and realistic btw what did u downvote
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:11:22 I'd like to insert the "I love democracy" line but i wont cause i Definitely do not like democracy
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:13:23 Btw, does modyfing a tutorial built plane to an extent where it doesn't feel/look low effort anymore count as low effort?
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:15:31 Bob, i once uploaded a pic of my "flying carpet" (thats what others call it) its op af too, yet it did get like what? 25 dislikes? Here, what counts is looks, not usefulness (sadly.)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:17:33 Btw, the name "flying carpet" along others comes from pvp mode cause of the tactics it takes to get that machine a use
(I uploaded it way back, i dont remember the date, or if i even got it up here)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:19:45 Just that the standards are a bit messed up in some's opinion (myself as an example.) Also, i tend to downvote my own builds xd (also i wish this timer was like a minute and a half, not two minutes)
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:21:49 Btw u said "do not upvote caus repost" so i did both just for compensation sake who is hof
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:23:53 Its a bad idea. 
In fact, dont post anything that is more useful than pretty
creations-chat 2021-01-06 16:32:08 Problem is, prejudice.
(Or something else, idk what to call it.)
Thing is, your first build is what they see first. They wont expect you to do better or worse, but they also don't allow for you to advance forward. (Simular to grammar schools in some cases.)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:56:27 Here we dont use meters we use studs (because those are our only given units of measurement in the game.)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:02:45 Umm.... someone suggested we shouldn't be warned for low effort builds?
Define low effort.
creations-chat 2021-01-23 04:05:23 Minecraft? Most likely low effort
Tutorials? Most likely low effort
Tutorial aircraft designs with edits in them?
Controversy
general 2021-01-23 04:06:27 Guys
general 2021-01-23 04:07:07 On Thursday it was the 21. day of the 21. year of the 21. century
general 2021-01-23 04:07:43 ...And someone suggested we shouldn't be warned for low effort builds?
general 2021-01-23 04:07:59 Define low effort
general 2021-01-23 04:08:50 I mean type of creation
general 2021-01-23 04:09:00 Tutorials as an example.
general 2021-01-23 04:09:32 Thing is...if you do major modifications to a tutorial build, who's design is it?
general 2021-01-23 04:09:58 H a r o l d
general 2021-01-23 04:10:59 When your mom takes your PS controller so you take her pain meds away 
"Get nae-nae'd"
general 2021-01-23 04:11:36 Okay what is going on here
general 2021-01-23 04:11:43 someone explain
general 2021-01-23 04:12:09 caus i dont understand and i assume ppl who read this portion again wont either
general 2021-01-23 04:13:13 So, a build that say, took 10 hours to figure out yet it looks way simplier is bad.
general 2021-01-23 04:13:18 i like them odds
general 2021-01-23 04:13:41 And ngl that carpet is low effort
general 2021-01-23 04:14:32 Noone:
The flying carpet:
"Get nae-nae'd"
general 2021-01-23 04:14:46 And no, i didnt give it that name
general 2021-01-23 04:15:28 It is an aircraft but it is shaped like a square
general 2021-01-23 04:15:47 (Primarily pvp aircraft)
general 2021-01-23 04:16:52 Thing is, it can do about 1050 studs a second, turn around in a 10 stud radious, then accelarate back to 1050 in a second
general 2021-01-23 04:17:10 All the while being totally stable
general 2021-01-23 04:17:44 Fun fact: i made that plane two years ago
general 2021-01-23 04:18:01 (Back then hover engine glitches didnt exist.)
general 2021-01-23 04:18:18 I made it to try counter shredderbugs
general 2021-01-23 04:18:33 It sorta worked... but since those things are WAY rarer
general 2021-01-23 04:18:46 It lost its primary function pretty much.
general 2021-01-23 04:19:35 Were at 26 rn
general 2021-01-23 04:19:39 28*
general 2021-01-23 04:19:48 This be 30
general 2021-01-23 04:19:56 My goal is not to be 36
general 2021-01-23 04:20:08 Who doesnt commit war crimes
general 2021-01-23 04:21:00 if you think about it shredder bugs, flying cubes of death and magic carpets are a war crime
general 2021-01-23 04:21:35 That is why we dont use magnet glitch engines anymore
general 2021-01-23 04:22:08 Hover glitch engines are balanced
general 2021-01-23 04:22:42 They have ridicolous speed, and okay horsepower

creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:48:11 Anthony, chameleon mode or stand out like a legendary Russian sniper?
Do so, it will definitely help
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:50:18 Well... i have written down color codes, problem with them is that they're camouflage colors.
(I've went as far as checking the sky for its color code, which is I think 145 80 200)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:52:40 Sorry for text wall, bit of a long list (atleast its organised)

Sky
80 145 200
80 145 193
176 204 211

Water
33 116 148
138 187 201
2 73 83

Ground
11 24 37
118 128 50
103 103 38 

Summer
61 91 77
67 108 74 

Winter
214 219 226
201 203 209
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:55:16 These are technically aircraft camouflage paint colors*
(That foggy effect is what it is meant to reflect.) The sky ones that start with the 80, those are the real effective ones (non-wintery environment)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 20:59:03 Those sky colors I use on many of my planes work finest (the best use of it being the 'flying carpet')
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:18:27 As I said, it is meant for that fog effect you get (originally made for aircraft, but, since you said "Please share if your willing, happy to test out diffrent camo's", I sent it over anyway.)
If you don't like it, it isn't a big deal, since every different camo is made to fulfill different goals. How good they do so is the test of a camo.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:20:29 Interesting
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:23:36 These camos were made for day operations, but, with some modifications, they could work at night.
By the 'fog' effect, I meant the one where you look into the distance and see the sky is a bit of a gray color.
Camo at night is a difficult thing to do correctly.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:26:12 That wouldn't work. To make night camos work, you must think in three dimensional.
For example, the bottom of the sides and the top need to be 'snowish grey' while the upper parts of the sides need to be black.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:28:33 Technically, unlike the summer map, the ground texture color codes aren't very different from each other. In fact, theres only one that changes slightly depending on the time of day in-game.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:30:35 I have an idea...
call it ||Littania||
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:32:36 How I got the color codes is that I simply took a screenshot in-game, then put that photo in Microsoft Paint, then looked at what color that was (it gives you a 3x3 digit color code as well as regular one)
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:36:00 Remix, i'm suprised that A7D is getting such feedback, since it is Roblox character scale, and those get hated on regulary just look at my builds

general 2021-04-11 13:32:48 i need it for a certain thing to do with colors
general 2021-04-11 13:33:44 i am trying to get a 97% effective color that blends in with the (in-game) sky
general 2021-04-11 13:34:30 it doesn't really (at least the in-game color palette
general 2021-04-11 13:34:49 I have two specific colors
general 2021-04-11 13:35:03 one is 80 145 200
general 2021-04-11 13:35:09 the other is 109 166 206
general 2021-04-11 13:35:19 (the latter is a bit lighter blue)

creations-chat 2021-10-23 03:40:10 What you do is put two motors with the exact same settings atop each other so the top one spins on the lower one then put your turret on it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:22:06 Every time I am trying to shoot someone down and use the firework launchers/guns on an enemy aircraft they visually become stuck in place
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:24:49 and suddenly the air behind me is bursting with lead from an invisible enemy
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:25:36 possibly an even worse RBLX client-server connection than mine
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:26:05 bc the quality of the wifi connection isn't the same as RBLX-client server
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:27:06 AKA its possible that everyone other than you freezes in place due to RBLX's own BS that you can't do anything to prevent
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:27:26 Its like time freezes around you permanently until you rejoin
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:27:43 yeah?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:28:11 i'm not sure myself but quite possibly the latter.
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:30:43 You probably have to be a certain level to stream.
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 14:30:49 correct me if i'm wrong.
general 2022-01-15 14:31:44 LEGO being sexist is a feminist conspiracy lol
general 2022-01-15 14:32:08 as with most feminist conspiracies, it's not true at all.
general 2022-01-15 14:33:47 Exactly
general 2022-01-15 14:35:08 Yes
general 2022-01-15 14:35:11 As it should be
general 2022-01-15 14:35:38 *exploding fragmentation grenade noises* Yes, Sir!
general 2022-01-15 14:37:11 lol
general 2022-01-15 14:38:10 wdym "depends"?
general 2022-01-15 14:38:55 @me
general 2022-01-15 14:39:09 ...of what?
general 2022-01-15 14:39:31 *applause*
general 2022-01-15 14:40:19 guess what
general 2022-01-15 14:40:33 spiders are the only web designers that enjoy finding bugs
general 2022-01-15 14:40:45 Hover drive better
general 2022-01-15 14:41:03 takes up less space
general 2022-01-15 14:41:20 potentially way more powerful
general 2022-01-15 14:41:34 THROTTLE
general 2022-01-15 14:42:09 you can change the power output of a hover drive
general 2022-01-15 14:42:13 when spawned in
general 2022-01-15 14:42:41 whereas a conveyor engine has a fixed speed due to the conveyor
general 2022-01-15 14:47:43 the only issue i can see is reliability as pistons can glitch into the hover thruster
general 2022-01-15 14:50:11 yeah
general 2022-01-15 14:50:39 i found that pushing the piston a bit closer to the hover thruster
general 2022-01-15 14:50:58 gives an about 15% extra power output
general 2022-01-15 14:52:23 I extend the pistons
general 2022-01-15 14:52:28 just slightly closer..
general 2022-01-15 14:52:36 ^
general 2022-01-15 14:53:15 Whats he benefit of fabric wingpanel?
general 2022-01-15 14:53:26 ik fabric is a lighter weight than
general 2022-01-15 14:53:33 the default material
general 2022-01-15 14:53:51 Wait they reduce dra-
general 2022-01-15 14:54:06 that gives me SEVERAL ideas..
general 2022-01-15 14:55:33 Moose
general 2022-01-15 14:55:41 Could you test for me
general 2022-01-15 14:55:56 you said shove the motor down
general 2022-01-15 14:56:07 'the hover thruster's throat'
general 2022-01-15 14:56:30 the non-collidable part.
general 2022-01-15 14:56:42 i'm guessing you do that with a piston
general 2022-01-15 14:56:52 ik.
general 2022-01-15 14:57:21 could you try putting a second hover thruster in front of the first one
general 2022-01-15 14:57:46 and a second piston behind the one that pushes the motor?
general 2022-01-15 14:59:11 TNT armor?
general 2022-01-15 14:59:25 Im guessing they just
general 2022-01-15 14:59:32 set it to such settings
general 2022-01-15 14:59:44 that cause it to not explode when shot
general 2022-01-15 14:59:55 does it
general 2022-01-15 15:00:19 Ngl fireworks
general 2022-01-15 15:00:28 are very deadly
general 2022-01-15 15:00:40 i have them mounted on planes..
general 2022-01-15 15:00:56 four of them firing one firework at once
general 2022-01-15 15:01:14 i was attacking some poor guy's M4 Sherman
general 2022-01-15 15:01:25 i kept popping his turret each time
general 2022-01-15 15:02:23 Does that
general 2022-01-15 15:02:34 work against shells better
general 2022-01-15 15:02:40 if so then its blursed
general 2022-01-15 15:03:19 Im guessing that's not Sprocket?
general 2022-01-15 15:03:32 O
general 2022-01-15 15:05:46 root firing?
general 2022-01-15 15:05:58 thats pushing the
general 2022-01-15 15:07:30 I wonder.. say, the collidable part of the motor
general 2022-01-15 15:07:38 that blocks the hover thruster does it
general 2022-01-15 15:07:49 from reaching the non-collidable part or..
general 2022-01-15 15:07:56 i'm applying too much realism?
general 2022-01-15 15:08:22 *aka overthinking it
general 2022-01-15 15:13:40 lads
general 2022-01-15 15:13:56 if i were to motorlock several hover engines together that would glitch out
general 2022-01-15 15:14:00 because of the motorlock
general 2022-01-15 15:14:05 at speed, would it?
general 2022-01-15 15:20:20 actually
general 2022-01-15 15:20:31 i have an 'aircraft'
general 2022-01-15 15:20:41 With 9 of the base hover drives on it.
general 2022-01-15 15:20:51 i found that if the piston face was
general 2022-01-15 15:20:59 glitched into the hover thruster itself
general 2022-01-15 15:21:04 it wouldn't work.
general 2022-01-15 15:21:27 what's the
general 2022-01-15 15:21:34 difference exactly?
general 2022-01-15 15:21:58 And a hover engine
general 2022-01-15 15:22:02 refers to the
general 2022-01-15 15:22:07 hover thruster only
general 2022-01-15 15:22:14 I'm guessing?
general 2022-01-15 15:22:33 oh.
general 2022-01-15 15:22:55 okay.
general 2022-01-15 15:24:08 because the face itself was behind where the thrust on the hover thruster is supposedly coming from
general 2022-01-15 15:45:14 Im guessing he refers to the linear on-
general 2022-01-15 15:45:36 i just checked YT and saw that many ppl do actually misuse the name
general 2022-01-15 15:45:48 and aren't aware of the difference?
general 2022-01-15 18:25:47 uhh
general 2022-01-15 18:25:52 idk
bug-reports 2022-08-19 12:04:53 There's a bug report I'd like to make concerning the join friend button, it works with ANYONE.
bug-reports 2022-08-19 17:37:34 Its not intended is it
bug-reports 2022-08-19 18:05:48 it kind of does when the annoying guy with the shredder spam realises it first
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:13:36 I was in pvp mode and an annoying guy with a shredder ball kept joining me. Dealt with him by making him taste his own medicine.
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:52:38 No clue
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:53:15 Do you mean directly or indirectly tho
bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:53:43 I had them directly attached and that was problematic
plane-crazy 2022-08-21 10:06:23 Guys, do magnets affect other people's creations or just our own?
general 2022-08-21 10:07:39 Guys ik am to ask this in <#384021699466756107>, but do magnets affect other ppls creations or just our own?
general 2022-08-21 10:08:01 Which i already have*
