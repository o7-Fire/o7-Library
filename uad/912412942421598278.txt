plane-crazy 2022-04-02 17:23:25 What fighter jet should I make? And what happened to the slowmode wth?
general 2022-08-08 14:27:39 someone is Dm advertising in this server
general 2022-09-08 22:00:32 This server wont give you pity for making something bad just because you're inexperienced, if it's ugly it's ugly and you better get good
general 2022-09-08 22:01:44 People legit gotta stop crying so hard that <#504436696021204992> gets a 40 minute slow mode just because they made garbage and expect people to be nice
general 2022-09-08 22:02:37 They have such a pick me attitude "omg I'm new but this is my build upvote plz" and get downvoted to oo oo aa aa and start crying mega hard
general 2022-09-08 22:03:25 I think people who make tutorials for ugly builds should delete them
general 2022-09-08 22:03:39 Ok
general 2022-09-08 22:03:41 We care
general 2022-09-08 22:03:59 He just screamed me to become the subject
general 2022-09-08 22:04:05 We doncare
general 2022-09-08 22:06:22 If you put in brackets "(I know it's bad)" on your post in <#384025409945337856> literally don't post it. It's bad and it's gonna get upvoted
general 2022-09-08 22:06:45 This is just a cry for pity upvotes that you're not gonna get
general 2022-09-08 22:08:29 That reaction tells me you've done that
general 2022-09-08 22:10:53 It is but if you're going to show others and expect upvotes instead of saying "I know it's bad" just don't post it
general 2022-09-08 22:11:51 How many more of these kids need to get downvote bombed for showing off a trashy looking build expecting pity upvotes before they stop
general 2022-09-08 22:12:53 I'd rather someone follow a tutorial than consistently make atrocious blocky builds that do nothing but blind you
general 2022-09-08 22:13:19 They blacklist you then ask you if their build is nice
general 2022-09-08 22:13:40 Someone told me to go to hell for blacklisting them back
general 2022-09-08 22:14:04 Yeah we know about those
general 2022-09-08 22:14:20 Instagram reels user right here
You know the queen died right?
general 2022-09-08 22:15:06 <@318892614378061824> is an Instagram reels user and just found out that prince Phillip died
general 2022-09-08 22:15:39 I think I scared you with relevant information so I told you something older
general 2022-09-08 22:15:52 I respect the queen
general 2022-09-08 22:15:58 But she's not my queen
general 2022-09-08 22:16:08 Omg YouTube shorts? Bro
general 2022-09-08 22:16:46 I wonder how people who are 100 years old who recieved a letter from the queen feel
general 2022-09-08 22:17:17 I've been in this server for a while and in the community even longer
general 2022-09-08 22:17:27 I have a lot of days but I haven't played much
general 2022-09-08 22:19:13 What does this mean and why do I care, at all
general 2022-09-08 22:19:47 I'm in like 60 servers what am I meant to do about that
general 2022-09-08 22:20:36 <@318892614378061824> hey, stupid nerd ðŸ¤“
The rule says unsolicited when you went out and specifically looked for the link in my bio
general 2022-09-08 22:20:51 You know what unsolicited means
general 2022-09-08 22:21:03 I'm not out here screaming for everyone to look at the link in my bio
general 2022-09-08 22:21:08 It's just there
general 2022-09-08 22:21:18 Yes
general 2022-09-08 22:21:40 I'm not
general 2022-09-08 22:21:50 Im not asking anyone to look
general 2022-09-08 22:21:52 It's there
general 2022-09-08 22:21:57 You're instigating
general 2022-09-08 22:22:16 Stop practicing arguing with people on discord and go practice talking to some girls
bot-central 2022-09-08 22:22:26 !red
bot-central 2022-09-08 22:22:32 Stupid commands
general 2022-09-08 22:22:54 You're instigating arguements
general 2022-09-08 22:22:59 I'm not soliciting
general 2022-09-08 22:23:13 Ok
general 2022-09-08 22:23:22 ðŸ’€
general 2022-09-08 22:23:31 Unsoliciting is not a doing word
general 2022-09-08 22:24:26 Unsolicited doing of stuff would be me pushing it onto people, I haven't asked anybody to look at it, you went out of your way to look at it without any input from me meaning it's not unsolicited, it was wanted, by you
general 2022-09-08 22:24:52 Plus the rule says nothing about having links in my bio
general 2022-09-08 22:25:02 I'm not asking for anything
general 2022-09-08 22:25:31 You started digging around my profile  to see if I'm a redditor because you got offended
general 2022-09-08 22:25:36 ðŸ¤“
general 2022-09-08 22:27:07 You went out of your way to call me uncool in a different server, wow
general 2022-09-08 22:27:24 You really did something
general 2022-09-08 22:28:19 Are you like special needs and you stay at home doing nothing and not developing socially so you call people "uncool" in different servers on discord like it hurts
general 2022-09-08 22:29:02 Cope harder ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
