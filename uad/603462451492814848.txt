plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:24:34 why is half wedge so good
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:24:40 its useful in anything
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:25:30 means you made a great plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:25:50 what's a tut
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:26:20 thank you for the clarification
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:26:23 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:35:10 what about hayao miyazaki's airships
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 03:35:19 those look cool i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:38:13 I can agree on that
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:38:41 It promotes creativity for builders to create their own designs or renditions of something they're copying or taking inspiration from
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:41:26 I think most of the people who follows tutorials uses the creations for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:41:38 Though maybe some use it in learning the mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:43:05 The one time I used a tutorial was for a simple helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:44:01 though it can't float in one place which really just makes it a plane with an upward facing propeller
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:44:33 what jet is that
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:45:17 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:45:48 design looks mediocre too
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:47:34 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 08:23:07 do the materials affect the weight of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-13 08:23:22 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-07-25 04:45:56 what's a good emoji or symbol to use for rectangular headlights?
