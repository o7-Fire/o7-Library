No evidence on toxicity - but it seems he's no more than an angst 12 year old. I believe JIMMY_MASTAalt5, one of the persons in the altercation, may have screenshots. I doubt it though.

plane-crazy 2019-11-28 03:02:04 Any of you know of a way to simulate a connector? Putting two parts together.
I was thinking magnets, but in my tests I couldn't figure out how to get them to stay together effectively.
plane-crazy 2019-11-28 03:05:42 I thought my daily TV dinners were disgusting.
I've had people tell me to learn to start cooking, but this... this needs help.
Hold on.

plane-crazy 2020-09-10 02:37:05 <@645128367611445248> he was just being a bit of a negative guy. constantly being rude about things and blowing up my stuff immediately in pvp. nothing too bad but kind of annoying
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 02:38:03 it's not like he was being really toxic, just super negative lol
