let me give you an explanation abt y its not too good that some people fucking lack to be able to do in this server


the cockpit is not the best, its slightly a bit more back, and the intakes are a bit too large. 
the tail wings aren't accurate that much and there is motorlock exposure on the wings.
the wings also begin a bit behind where you placed them on your F35, and your fuselage is a bit short (in height).
its an OK attempt, i guess i can see some effort.
oh and the paintjob needs improvement

Your F15 is actually pretty nice.

but it can improve
there is quite some exposed motorlock, and the area in front of the engines arent fully flat.
The intakes are only meant to be going downwards in one certain angle, but youve used two types of wedges.

other than that, its a pretty nice jet

OK so you understand how motor locking works but your designing of aircraft is not the best

I know its a custom MiG-15 based aircraft but it does not look good and there is exposed motor locks,
maybe you can improve on the shape of the plane too, and the wings are detached from the actual body of the plane. The cockpit can improve, and the horizontal stabilizers at the back can improve a lot.
Also nobody in the community likes custom planes im sorry lol, it looks slightly like a Mig 19 though without the 2 engines

P.S: the wings are long as fuck

help 2022-04-18 16:48:58 the colour is terrible
help 2022-04-18 16:49:02 you can barely see the stuff
help 2022-04-18 16:49:05 change the colour around a bit
help 2022-04-18 16:49:15 or do a different camera angle
help 2022-04-18 19:37:54 alright, so
help 2022-04-18 19:38:55 make sure that the motors circled in blue are not touching the parts in which you want to move.
help 2022-04-18 19:39:18 basically, it looks like the base of the motors (the parts on the end which dont move) are connected to both leg joints.
help 2022-04-18 19:39:42 you have to make sure that the base is only connected to one leg joint, which is the one you want to keep still.
help 2022-04-18 19:40:31 If that does not work, then its probably because both motors have the same keybinds.
help 2022-04-18 19:40:58 Make sure that the forward keybind of one motor is the backwards keybind of the other, because if not, then one motor is trying to move in an opposite direction of the other motor, locking them in position.
help 2022-04-18 19:41:20 If none of the above work then the rotatable part is probably colliding with something
general 2022-04-18 19:42:19 that moment when

general 2022-04-20 19:35:02 etc
general 2022-04-20 19:35:04 how
general 2022-04-20 19:35:11 yes with motorlock im trying
general 2022-04-20 19:35:14 but the controls mess up
general 2022-04-20 19:35:20 i want it one block wide, one block high
general 2022-04-20 19:35:29 : (
general 2022-04-20 19:36:01 im trying to make something like this but 1 block wide and 1 block high
general 2022-04-20 19:36:14 idk why there is shit in the background
general 2022-04-20 19:36:16 but i need to make that
general 2022-04-20 19:36:23 look ok
general 2022-04-20 19:36:25 i had no other choice
general 2022-04-20 19:36:32 nooo
general 2022-04-20 19:36:45 like 1 block wide, 1 block high (in height) but the length is like idk 7 or 8
general 2022-04-20 19:37:09 turn that rocket image i send sideways and u see what i mean
general 2022-04-20 19:37:15 ok so here is my issue
general 2022-04-20 19:37:19 i turn it, all the controls invert.
general 2022-04-20 19:37:41 ill get there soon
general 2022-04-20 19:37:44 i think
general 2022-04-20 19:37:50 but
general 2022-04-20 19:37:57 basically i turn the thing
general 2022-04-20 19:37:59 it starts to tilt
general 2022-04-20 19:38:01 the controls invert
general 2022-04-20 19:38:07 left is up, right is down, and crap
general 2022-04-20 19:38:26 im using
general 2022-04-20 19:38:27 custom
general 2022-04-20 19:38:30 stuff
general 2022-04-20 19:38:36 i tried using propellors and that stuff
general 2022-04-20 19:38:40 no work
general 2022-04-20 19:39:10 bro when it turns, the left control is the up control
general 2022-04-20 19:39:14 everything changes and it messes it up
general 2022-04-20 19:39:18 i want the missile to be fully stable
general 2022-04-20 19:39:20 doesnt randomly tilt
general 2022-04-20 19:39:56 yes, but that means i would need to change controls every single time
general 2022-04-20 19:40:10 imagine playing a game ok and there are enemies around you, but every second the controls change
general 2022-04-20 19:40:13 imagine how hard that would be
general 2022-04-20 19:40:15 its like that
general 2022-04-20 19:40:28 thats my question lol
general 2022-04-20 19:40:29 how
general 2022-04-20 19:40:56 the missile launches upwards, you make it go straight, as soon as u turn, the controls changed because the thing tilts
general 2022-04-20 19:41:12 yes
general 2022-04-20 19:41:36 what
general 2022-04-20 19:41:47 ok so when the plane tilts, the propellor thats meant to take u upwards also changes directions
general 2022-04-20 19:41:51 so instead, its goes left
general 2022-04-20 19:42:03 unless
general 2022-04-20 19:42:07 ok nvm i found solution
general 2022-04-20 19:42:23 just put camera on it <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-12-25 22:53:20 Triceps dips is very easy

You can do it on any flat surface
general 2022-12-25 22:53:28 Regardless of where
general 2022-12-25 22:53:51 lol I just do it on my bed
general 2022-12-25 22:54:05 I know
general 2022-12-25 22:54:10 But my bed is not comfy
general 2022-12-25 22:54:14 So I found a better use
general 2022-12-25 22:54:15 For it
general 2022-12-25 22:54:28 Ye I'm talking about arms behind
general 2022-12-25 22:54:40 Wtf?? Isn't in front an incline push
general 2022-12-25 22:55:51 Before any of you guys go the same way as me (I'm only at average weight because of this)

When you don't want to then do it (workout)
general 2022-12-25 22:56:29 Oh those ye I haven't done those yet but all I know is that 1 of my friends got fucked doing those they messed it up
general 2022-12-25 22:56:53 Weight
general 2022-12-25 22:56:57 What is your weight
general 2022-12-25 22:57:06 Lb?
general 2022-12-25 22:57:12 Bro
general 2022-12-25 22:57:33 I'm 5'8 and weigh 57 kf (like 130-150 lb)
general 2022-12-25 22:59:46 I haven't used weights but a gym motivator told me if I ever get one then put a massive strain on your muscles so they grow, but don't overdo it otherwise you will injure urself. the pull up bar is very good though it trains biceps, an important muscle make sure to do multiple reps of 10-20, take a small break (20s) then repeat, haven't used the other equipment but I'm guessing you should use those in reps too
general 2022-12-25 23:00:32 If it doesn't hurt or make you exhausted then it is not working

general 2023-02-14 17:07:34 free france
general 2023-02-14 21:17:59 Both one
general 2023-02-14 21:18:02 nice
general 2023-02-14 21:19:04 osu is not an anime game
general 2023-02-14 21:19:42 In what way
general 2023-02-14 21:20:20 OSU not an anime game
general 2023-02-14 21:20:35 In what way
general 2023-02-14 21:20:45 Convince me OSU is an anime game
general 2023-02-14 21:20:59 Ok
general 2023-02-14 21:21:13 So if a game has an animecharacter
general 2023-02-14 21:21:17 It becomes an anime
general 2023-02-14 21:21:28 That is not OSU
general 2023-02-14 21:21:37 That is COD
general 2023-02-14 21:21:43 On the other hand
general 2023-02-14 21:21:56 If a game has anime characters does that make it anime
general 2023-02-14 21:22:07 Are you sure
general 2023-02-14 21:22:28 So if a skin on a vehicle has an anime character
general 2023-02-14 21:22:32 It becomes an anime
general 2023-02-14 21:22:43 Ah
general 2023-02-14 21:22:50 Now we have the issue
general 2023-02-14 21:23:05 If it is focused on anime characters then it is an anime
general 2023-02-14 21:23:28 you are telling me it has anime characters = it's anime game
general 2023-02-14 21:23:42 so a anime character as a customisable skin
general 2023-02-14 21:23:50 Is still technically an anime character
general 2023-02-14 21:23:58 so would you call War Thunder
general 2023-02-14 21:24:00 anime
general 2023-02-14 21:24:20 Ok
general 2023-02-14 21:24:28 yeah if the game based on anime
general 2023-02-14 21:24:31 then it isanime
general 2023-02-14 21:24:47 ok <@163143541160148992>
general 2023-02-14 21:25:41 yes
