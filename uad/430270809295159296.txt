help 2023-04-06 21:02:15 Use a normal motor to spin it, place a block above the rotor, place motor2 on the 4 sides on the block and place wing panels out from the motor2.

Make the motor2s servo and tilt them to create lift while the main motor ir spinning.

Copy the design on top of the block and make it go double the speed in the other direction. Also make the motor2s go in the other direction

general 2023-05-11 12:48:56 <:shrug:968573507451650098>
general 2023-05-11 12:49:18 its basically what PC2 would be
general 2023-05-11 12:49:22 but its already out
general 2023-05-11 12:51:41 Stormworks have much better logics and physics than plane crazy
general 2023-05-11 12:51:54 Hell, you can make a whole ass computer from scratch in Stormworks
general 2023-05-11 12:53:36 Yes, it has a microcontroller editor with logic gates and shit
general 2023-05-11 12:54:32 Frfr
general 2023-05-11 12:54:34 this guy gets it
general 2023-05-11 12:55:27 Its like 180 NOK
general 2023-05-11 12:55:30 Not much
general 2023-05-11 12:55:42 Or 18£

general 2023-05-11 12:57:36 But the thing is
general 2023-05-11 12:57:45 In plane crazy you cant make nuclear reactors
general 2023-05-11 12:57:51 in stormworks you can
general 2023-05-11 12:58:22 And jet engines in stormworks actually have a moderate amount of thrust
general 2023-05-11 12:58:29 Yes of course
general 2023-05-11 12:58:45 duh
general 2023-05-11 12:58:45 Every building game must have a possibility for nuclear power
general 2023-05-11 12:59:01 Hell, you can even make the reactor blow up
general 2023-05-11 12:59:04 Kinda fun
general 2023-05-11 12:59:53 You can make T72b also
general 2023-05-11 13:00:15 And you dont have to make anything by yourself because you can upload and download from workshop
general 2023-05-11 13:01:08 for gods sake

general 2023-05-16 12:50:14 🤔
general 2023-05-16 12:50:30 Doesn't the game limit at mach 5 something?
general 2023-05-16 12:51:35 No, normally the game would reset your speed to 0km/h when reaching mach 5 or something
general 2023-05-16 12:51:56 itk its implemented in the game code
general 2023-05-16 12:52:12 If you mod the engine properties for superspeed it happens
general 2023-05-16 12:52:31 Although nothing in the game can naturally go mach 5 so doesnt really matter
