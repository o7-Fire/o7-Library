plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:43:03 
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:43:18 this is what they look like
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:43:35 I think its just the motors causing the sliding
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:43:52 but idk what I would cover the motors with, if I could in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:44:10 ladders might work actually
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:44:24 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:44:43 o the motors?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:45:58 yea I think its the treads
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:46:07 cause my wheels have the most contact they could have with the treads
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:46:23 esp the rocker and sprocket, both of which have teeth
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:46:31 imma try to cover the motors w/ ladders
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:49:13 rip, ladders make it less grippy
