bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:15:08 i love this game
bug-reports 2023-07-07 05:15:46 yeah probably
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:52:11 just wondering, do larger blocks like the wedge 1x4 have more health?
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:52:14 or like the beam?
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:54:35 i guess that makes sense
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:55:18 yeah cause I thought if I used things like 1x1s I'd be able to minimize damage
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:55:28 cause I thought most blocks had same hp
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 07:58:15 im gonna get on an alt rq and test the better health thing
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 02:35:05 <@568939230865260554> has the best jet in the game
