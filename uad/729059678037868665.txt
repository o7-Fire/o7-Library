plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:24:45 Is it still original if I use mech frame from yt BUT remaster it **__COMPLETELY__** and adding flight capabilities? then build my mech using it
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:26:07 Maybe make it a little shorter
general 2021-10-01 18:26:38 Is it still original if I use mech frame from yt BUT remaster it **__COMPLETELY__** and adding flight capabilities? then build my mech using it
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:26:55 2-3
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:30:02 I never understood motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:30:10 What does it do
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:30:16 How does it do it
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:31:32 Still dont get it, im more of a visual learner, also why would you need that?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:32:20 And does that kinda drag blocks along with it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:32:31 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:37:15 Been trying to finish what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:37:47 Oh

plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:40:11 This is probabily what my mech is gonna look like
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:40:34 Also, is it possible to make a detailed build without motor locking?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:41:35 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:41:53 Titanfall style northstar class mech
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:42:28 I could show a refference
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:42:43 To what im gonna build
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:07 
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:11 <@720751430595772418>
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:27 Ofc not detailed rockets and hands
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:37 And no gun because weight
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:43:56 I was gonna put normal shooty rockets there
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:44:20 IM NOT GONNA MAKE IT IN FULL DETAIL
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:44:39 I wanna focus on it being flyable (and being able to move)
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:45:38 I did, but I meant stuff like The eye and Livery and cabin shape/size/weight
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:46:01 And I do wanna make The cabin open
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:46:48 Ill just color into a shape that looks remotely close
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:47:11 Im not good at making it round AND ABLE TO OPEN
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:48:13 Also The old one I had couldnt fly for shit
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:52:16 Also, <@720751430595772418> how would I do The back thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:52:30 Sorry for low quality
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:53:29 There, The only 2 images relevant (again, sorry for bad quality)
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:57:33 Or just 4 motors (1 for each), so I can control them as actual thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 18:59:37 But I guess it seems ill have to learn motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 19:10:04 Oh yeah delta?'s mech frame
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 19:10:12 Lemme check
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 19:10:50 Ive seen that when I was looking for a more Basic frame
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 19:10:52 t
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 19:12:16 Looks an awful lit like this one  https://youtu.be/4GanlwUVArU

-fully posable (even mid air)

-thrusters that dont ruin The design

-fairly easy to pilot

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:01:36 Guys is it possible to make rocket launchers fire full auto/in a burst? Like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:02:39 How do I make them small enough to do that
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:03:22 Im not gonna bring it to pvp, might aswell do that
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:04:10 THAT GOES STR8 TO HALL OF FAME
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:52:38 I went on phone to take anither look at The old version I had (I call it the mk1) it flies like crap and cant walk but uts something (also no motorlocks on my mech frame)
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 07:52:52 Imma remaster The frame and give it a New look
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:51:55 I need a way to make small rockets that can fire fast
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:52:15 Like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:53:36 Yes, how do I make them small enough, because that launcher is 3/4 The size of a player and there are about 8 rockets in one of them
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 09:54:28 Fireworks it is <:nooo:787097964946259978>

bot-central 2021-10-02 10:09:45 Ye, how do I use my display name
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:35:06 Is there a way to make a wall you can see through from inside but you cant see through from The outside? 
Because using glass for The front part of the cabin would ruin The design
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:41:06 Yes, that is what im doing, I had an older one that couldnt fly or walk for shit and im remastering it completely
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:41:20 This is the old one btw
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 10:43:52 How
