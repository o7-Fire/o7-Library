Stg 44
Germany developed numerous new weapons during the war although was unable to field many of these weapons in any meaningful number, including the first mass-produced assault rifle in the world.

Beginning in 1940, Germany solicited developmental prototypes for a semi-automatic rifle to replace the commonly used Karabiner 98k, a bolt-action rifle, for better performance in infantry. Two rifle manufacturers, Walther and Mauser submitted competing designs. These would be known as the Gewehr 41, with the entry by Mauser being designated G41M and Walther's being designated G41W.

In 1941, Germany began developing the first mass-produced assault rifle, in what eventually became the Sturmgewehr 44 . However, the rifle did not make a decisive impact on the war due to a variety of factors. Some of the factors which affected the utility of the Sturmgewehr 44 were, the declining state of the German war effort as of early 1943, delays in design and production due to administrative infighting, the allied bombing of German industry, and concerns over the feasibility of introducing a new rifle and ammunition into Germany's strained logistical infrastructure. [1]

The primary German submachine gun of the war was the MP40. This 9×19mm Parabellum open bolt submachine gun was a simplified version of the MP38 making use of stamped steel as opposed to machined components. The MP40 is notable for being an early user of polymers with both the handguard and the pistol grip being made of Margolit (a variation of Bakelite). It is believed over 1,000,000 MP40s were produced by 1944.[2]

Germany is notable also for their development and use of the General purpose machine gun although doctrinally these were known as universal machineguns with the two most notable examples of these being the MG34 and MG42, these air-cooled, open bolt machineguns were originally designed to circumvent the ban on machineguns imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.[3]

general 2023-03-20 06:55:06 Germany also developed a pulsejet powered cruise missile known as the V-1 as well as the first rocket-powered ballistic missiles known as the (V-2). Though their impact on the course of the war was minimal, after the war, the Allied powers made efforts to capture personnel involved in these projects for their own weapons programs, in the case of Russia this was known as Operation Osoaviakhim and in the case of the United States it came in the form of Operation_Paperclip however these are by no means the only efforts made by the allies to secure German technical personnel during or after WW2.

general 2023-03-20 06:55:45 Me 262
Germany produced the first jet powered plane to see combat, the Messerschmitt Me 262. Entering service one month before the Gloster Meteor in April 1944, it was too late to make an impact against the allied air forces.

The Germans also experimented with flying wing aircraft. Namely the Horten_Ho_229 using the same engines as the Me 262. Several prototypes of the aircraft were made with 60 being ordered in total however no examples of the aircraft ever entered service, and what was left of the project was captured by Allied forces.

creations-chat 2023-06-15 01:46:58 A bit more longer and maybe it would look better with smoke pipes instead of fireworks?

creations-chat 2023-07-03 11:10:42 Hey <@891222550397485107> I want to give feedback but firstly what the hell is this?
creations-chat 2023-07-03 11:13:08 Get rid of the faces and change the colours and REMAKE the entire thing otherwise it just looks like a blue version of hell
creations-chat 2023-07-03 11:16:02 <@891222550397485107> make some simple stuff like a battleship and slowly improve otherwise your just gonna be a shit builder....
