plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:04:09 yo
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:05:09 i made an anti aircraft thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:05:12 is this nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:05:56 hhjonk
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:06:20 it has s p i n n y r a d a r

plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:07:31 gun depression 100
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:07:41 a fullblooded russian vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:08:27 i want to try replacing the rocket launchers with a prop missile
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:08:33 but the issue is those things are hard to make
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:12:10 uh oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:12:28 its the shilkaguska
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:15:20 <@!335599526414909451> how did you get so many small parts
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:15:37 is there a trick?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:15:49 whats that
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:16:52 jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:16:55 so how does it work
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:17:49 wait a sec
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:17:55 so if you lock two motors together and link them
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:18:03 it can compress blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:18:16 kowalski analysis
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:19:06 is it one of those things that requires insane amounts of trial and error and engineering to get the simplest amount done?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:20:27 so basically
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:20:34 linking the two locked motor assemblies will compress it by one block
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:20:58 i dont understand how to do it
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:21:00 and how it works
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:21:09 aaaAAA
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:22:06 how do i stack the guns
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:22:17 i need to make my thing have more brrr
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:23:30 im trying to figure out how but i cant
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:24:32 how do i make this go more than one block
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:25:38 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:25:45 using motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:25:47 so its tighter
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:26:12 since i cannot apply logic to this when i don't understand it
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:26:51 <@!670939038999511041> can you help
help 2020-08-10 18:29:30 how do i do the basics of motorlocking
help 2020-08-10 18:29:34 i cant figure out the logic behind it
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:31:35 longe barrel
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:31:47 imagine being able to make a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:32:17 should i attempt to make trash abrams
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:35:19 fuck you
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:35:20 doing it anyway
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:35:59 ah fuck this thing is gonna be rather wide
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:36:02 i cant get the correct dimensions
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:37:28 idk if this is too long or not
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:37:29 aaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:43:02 abruhms
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:49:13 my mans made a T-34 built like a hetzer if it was british instead of german
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:56:11 the abruhms is coming together not nicely
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:56:26 its gonna look more like a T-90 with an abrams turret than an abrams
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:57:46 Yes.
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 18:58:37 generic MBT
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:02:39 abrhmms
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:02:44 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:04:17 imma make the engine bay a crew compartment because why not
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:07:25 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:09:02 alright all the crew except the guy in the turret will be in the engine compartment
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:09:13 because its better to have the driver inside the gas turbine engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:09:16 more awareness
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:09:19 of how the engine is doing
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 19:09:21 you see
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:23:55 building at night is annoying
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:24:03 its hard to see the different edges of your build
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:41:43 ffs
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:41:49 i hate designing this stupid abrams turret
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:42:05 the turret ring part keeps ramming into the engine bay
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:44:04 
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:44:16 theres literally nothing i can do about this
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:47:03 i dont know how to do motorlock shit
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:47:08 why would it even help in this situation
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:47:40 yes but how
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:47:48 idk how to set up the things
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:49:19 what do i do if i dont have enough space to put in the shit
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:51:10 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:51:14 im super confused on what to do
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:51:19 i can't bring it back enough for it to work
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:51:32 the only way for me to do this is to just remove that entire sloped bit of the engine bay
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:53:22 it just doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 22:53:27 i cant use motorlock in this situation
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:01:21 how do i do the front bit of an abrams turret without motorlocking
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:12 idk how to make motor block arrays
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:14 idk how they work
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:27 idk what the different blocks specifically do and what it means to a built
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:03:35 i dont have enough fucking experience
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:04:07 you know what
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:04:08 fuck this
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:04:11 im making a Jagdbrams

plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:08:50 its the fact that when i attempt to make it in the shape of an abrams
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:08:59 the turret ring is just big enough to ram against the front of the engine bay
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:09:06 and i cant fix that no matter what ie tried
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 23:09:12 i have no idea how this happened

creations-chat 2020-08-11 01:39:39 i cant figure it out
creations-chat 2020-08-11 01:39:48 wouldn't all the motors take up a ton of space and be sticking out of the tank?

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:59:04 ITS SO STUPID
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:59:10 I JUST SAWED A TANK IN HALF
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:59:29 also if im skilled enough i can actually deflect a missile
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:59:32 lucky enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 02:59:44 by getting it to track the swordi nstead of me
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:05:29 TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF FLEX TAPE
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:05:32 I SAWED THIS BOAT IN HALF!
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:12:13 AAAA
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:13:03 is this what hell is like
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:22:47 i just got an idea for a creation
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:18 my abrams chassis, a giant robotic arm that spills a coffee cup full of spherical explosives on things
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:27 ol reliable
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:32 should i make it
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:37 its gonna be a bit hard
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:43 since the entire build* will be strange
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:23:59 i'll have to manually control it instead of mouse aim for most of it
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:39:09 messed it up
creations-chat 2020-08-11 03:39:57 IT WORKS
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:41:38 i made my abrams have a giant coffee cup on it with explosives in it on a servo
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:41:47 on a giant stick
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:41:54 so i can pour it over builds and detonate
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 03:47:30 it works flawlessly except for when i accidently tilt the tank over and spill the drink by swinging it around too fast
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:28:10 wait a second
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:28:19 couldnt the smallest plane only have a few combinations of blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:28:50 sub
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:29:04 im pretty sure attaching 2 control surfaces and an engine to a chair might work
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:29:09 one on the side and one on the roof
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:29:13 and then fly it diagonally
creations-chat 2020-08-11 12:45:40 the nights edge abrams works pretty well when i up the speed
creations-chat 2020-08-11 13:23:17 why isnt this working

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:54:08 the only way i can think of this working is if i exposed the spring mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:54:16 and plus it makes the motors in the turret really jittery for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 00:57:44 uhhhh

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:03:12 well then idk how i can do that
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:03:27 the spring needs to be lengthened and contract on command

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:33:31 german world problems

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:36:59 i made cursed recoil mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:03 instead of retracting backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:08 rapidly
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:11 it shoots forward and slowly retracts
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:14 because recoil gay
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:22 spring gay
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:37:27 why would a disconnector help

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:38:08 oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:38:16 i meant like a decorational thing there
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:39:09 imagine it in reverse
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:39:14 it shoots forward
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:39:17 and slowly retracts
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 01:51:54 shredder bugs suck

plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:54:22 delete
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:58:06 J_Jab1234 is an asshole
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:58:17 he's flying around at speeds faster than most jets gunning everyone in the server down while we cant hit him
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:58:21 and not listening to any of us
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:58:28 imagine being a tryhard in plane crazy PVP
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:59:37 he just wants to kill entire servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 02:59:39 using a glitch vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:01 and now he's lag bombing the server
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:02 fucking fantastic
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:11 this is why we need a votekick system lmao
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:41 well not specifically lagbombing
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:50 more like specifically targeting the single largest vehicle on the server (motorlocked tank)
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:00:56 bombing it over and over in his spawn
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:01:00 causing absolutely absurd amounts of lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:24:24 its not a turret ring
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:24:25 its a turret dent
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:29:31 this is quite possibly one of the cleanest turrets ive made
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:29:34 and yet it sucks so much
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:29:44 it can get stuck on the back of the tank if i swivel it too slow
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:29:52 but it uses a motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 03:29:54 so im now pro
creations-chat 2020-08-12 03:43:12 am i doing a good job
creations-chat 2020-08-12 03:43:21 :)
creations-chat 2020-08-12 03:43:30 its my first time using motorlock in a build
creations-chat 2020-08-12 03:43:37 i had to make the turret indent a little
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:20:47 im assuming that thing fucking folds like an accordion
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:47:05 
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:47:12 it has a habit of getting stuck
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:47:21 the turret ring is too perfect of a fit
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:47:29 but im not fixing that because i have no clue how
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:49:36 wait a sec
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:49:48 i have enough space to motorlock a 1x0.9 block downward by half a block
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:49:50 which would be perfect
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:54:04 
creations-chat 2020-08-12 12:54:51 mega brain engineering
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 12:59:26 my first motorlocking job
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 12:59:28 moved a thing downward
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 12:59:39 
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 12:59:42 so the turret wouldn't get stuck
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 12:59:46 half block 0.9x
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 13:00:00 im proud of this and idk why

creations-chat 2020-08-12 18:19:41 tiger?
creations-chat 2020-08-12 18:56:41 sights™️
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:51 ive made a couple upgrades to my tank
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:53 1: bag storage
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:16:59 2: smoke on the gun and an actual barrel thing
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:15 3: the turret machine gun has a camera, scope, and you can lock the turning on it for ease of access in first person mode
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:43 yeah but the main issue is that i dont have the right parts
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:17:46 and im not very good at motor locking
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:00 improvements can definitely be made
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:15 i would have to completely remove the current turret
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:21 and replace it with different layers for components
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:18:24 that all collapse together when done
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:28 the biggest thing i can upgrade on this tank is the track
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:36 instead of making fake conveyor tracks i could add real suspension
creations-chat 2020-08-12 19:21:42 but the problem with that is its H A R D
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 19:32:36 tank gang
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 21:34:15 why does my turret's gun fling all over the place when i put suspension on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 21:43:25 is it possible for me to make this fit into that
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 21:43:31 without it connecting to the main turret
plane-crazy 2020-08-12 21:46:07 i wish i could just resize things

creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:31 the sword has a special ability
creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:49 whenever it strikes something it attacks pretty much everything in a large radius around me
creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:35:54 due to it spazzing out

plane-crazy 2020-08-13 03:14:22 its impossible to control 25% of the time
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 03:16:23 when it goes apeshit enough it can actually swing itself across the map
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 03:17:30 like that

plane-crazy 2020-08-14 03:59:20 so it would do it easier
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 03:59:43 guess im the best swordsman in the game
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 03:59:46 as in
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 03:59:48 the only swordsman
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:09 uhh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:13 probably the seedler
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:20 im gonna do the zenith last
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:38 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:54 thats literally just a fucking stick with a sharp stick on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:00:56 uninspired design
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 04:01:04 no shape
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 12:15:50 <@!447221768520859659> yes (except for the terra blade components and all the other shit)
creations-chat 2020-08-14 15:54:12 wait a sec
creations-chat 2020-08-14 15:54:19 if i get my tank to fly and be able to do VTOL
creations-chat 2020-08-14 15:54:24 i can get a shitload of things
creations-chat 2020-08-14 15:54:27 because the swords
creations-chat 2020-08-14 15:54:34 including pixel art if it gets enough upvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:13:26 the body is good
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:13:27 the wings are not
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:18:20 should i attempt to make cursed tank suspension
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:18:54 how
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:19:09 just fuckin
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:19:11 i got an idea
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:21:13 ok so
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:21:21 my tank suspension is gonna involve a mouse guided stabilizer system
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:24:56 this is gonna be FUCKED
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:26:39 ITS A BIT HARD TO CONTROL
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:27:33 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:27:59 its like a trailer but every part of it is powered
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:29:26 and you steer the trailer instead of steering the car
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:09 now to just give it tracks
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:13 i have no clue how
creations-chat 2020-08-14 16:30:51 i wonder if i can do this for every wheel
general 2020-08-14 18:16:38 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:01:30 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:02:30 i need to make a mech
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:02:32 imma make the worst mech
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:02:48 how do i maek am ech
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:05:06 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:05:16 hm
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:05:17 i need balance
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:08:18 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:08:22 should i add friction blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:13:55 ok wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:14:00 how do i make this thing stable?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 19:14:10 is it possible to makei t not just tip over
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 21:02:49 we need to make charles' helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 21:03:05 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:23:06 hows this for the front of a heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:23:17 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:03 door
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:09 
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:45:30 now how do i make a propeller for a heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:20 it flies
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:22 but theres too much torque
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:55:25 and it goes crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:56:15 how do i make the helicopter not spin out of control
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:56:19 due to torque
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:57:56 I FIXED THE SPINNING SOMEHOW
creations-chat 2020-08-14 21:57:59 I JUST ADDED MORE MOTORS
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:08:54 what are the heaviest blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:09:03 ballast blocks dont change the weight
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:09:07 only buoyancy
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:13:47 *this is the greatest pLAAAAAAAAN*
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:24 do i give my heli a sword
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:26 or my future heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:30 idk what to do with it
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:34 it doesnt have a tail
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:14:40 its flying Ka-52 style
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:32 ffs
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:36 the center of mass is too far forward
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:40 and im out of weight to weigh
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:33:47 the ballast tanks dont work very well
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:12 <@!697786877444358186> you mean unverified?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:36 because that kinda makes it so that no new people can ever post in creations
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:43 if its only unranked
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:34:48 when you get ranks exclusively in creations
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:37:12 ah
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:39:26 how do i get lots of weight in a block
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:39:32 i cant get my center of mass forward enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:39:45 those dont change based on the density
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:39:50 the CoM doesnt change
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:40:26 well that makes it a bit fucking difficult
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:42:12 my helicopter still tilts backward
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:42:17 despite the fact the weight is focused in the front
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:42:18 wtf
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:42:47 how do you fucking do this
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:44:17 im trying to not use helium
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:46:45 WHY IS THIS THING SO UNSTABLE
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:47:03 especially when using automatic controls
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:47:10 i guess the game doesn't know how to handle heli
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:47:24 adding a tail rotor wont help
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:51:56 how do i stop my helicopter from tilting back and forth
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:52:55 but
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:52:57 when i balance it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:52:59 it tilts backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:53:08 no matter what i do
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:53:12 i have to put the CoM way infront
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:55:55 points towards cursopr
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:56:28 FUCKING HELICOPTER
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:56:31 STOP TILTING BACKWARDS
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:56:39 NO MATTER HOW FAR AHEAD THE CENTER OF MASS IS
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:56:51 IT ALWAYS TILTS
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:57:37 can someone come into vip1 and help
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 22:59:16 why cant you
creations-chat 2020-08-14 22:59:49 some shredder bugs are cool if they aren't designed to just wipe servers (mostly die trying)
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:00:19 ive seen a shredder bug style build (same mechanic) that was literally a fucking shark with moving jaw
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:00:38 im stealing that idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:00:52 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:01:00 you can join vip1
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:01:36 now you do
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:02:02 ive balanced the CoM so that it stays stable for a solid second
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:02:06 and then it starts doing backflips
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:02:32 is that a scooper
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:03:23 what am i doing wrong other than my heli looks like shit
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:06:20 im putting them inside the cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:06:22 but
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:06:27 i have a feeling helium is kinda necessary in this case
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:07:22 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:07:26 where the fuck is helium?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:07:46 i cant find helium
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:08:06 oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:08:07 im an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:08:30 what does apply at center mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:08:38 just makes the helium at the center of mass?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:09:26 it isnt working
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:10:24 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:10:26 why do i need that
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:10:29 its a fucking helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:00 ive shoved like 15 helium blocks in the back
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:05 and its still flipping backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:11 and my CoM is forward
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:16 what the fuck is going on?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:39 helium is in here
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:48 weight here
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:11:55 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:12:50 ive added 15
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:12:53 its still flipping backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:13:23 i need more
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:13:27 it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:13:41 2 or 3 literally does nothing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:13:45 im not joking
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:14:08 but that doesnt make it a heli
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:14:40 that doesnt make it a heli
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:39 
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:41 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:43 thats what im doing
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:50 it doesnt rotate around due to torque
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:53 i made sure of that
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:15:58 it's just super fucking unstable
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:16:03 and i cant fix it no matter what ive tried
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:16:23 that would just reduce the lift
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:16:45 im pretty sure that makes it impossible to balance
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:16:51 the game literally cant support that
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:17:05 im trying to move the center of mass to the rotor
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:18:10 also
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:18:26 why would tilting the center of mass as forward as possible cause the heli to flip backwards
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:18:34 what could be going on there?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:21:28 alr i made it stable enoguh to fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:26:16 i cant change prop pitch
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:26:23 theres too much speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:26:27 and it just flattens out
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:42:49 no helium no motorlock shitty heli
creations-chat 2020-08-14 23:43:04 the only damn reason this thing can fly is that im a slightly better than average pilot
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:50:43 how do i make something float
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:50:53 what density is water in this game
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:51:26 nvm got it
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:52:50 it only floated once wtf
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:56:05 i cant makei t float again
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:56:07 idk wtf i did
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:57:18 do ballast blocks set to 0.15 weigh less
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:57:21 than normal blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:58:30 theres a pontoon block?
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:59:07 where would they be
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:59:08 oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-14 23:59:11 where are they
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:13:27 its a bit fucking wet
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:13:31 but it works
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:13:35 as a rescue heli
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:14:01 not very
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:17:36 it doesnt float in lava
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:17:59 should i give it a sword
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:33:20 ive done what ive had to do
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:54:45 it works
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 00:54:49 sword heli
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:05:02 hmmm
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:05:23 build sword heli
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:31 <@!492887853702053898> wait i got a cool idea
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:47 autogyro
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:06:57 basically just imagine a plane helicopter
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:19 basically
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:28 the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:37 if you push down on the stick the rotor on the top will lose energy and stop
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:07:48 which basically means doing the one thing you should always do in a stall makes you stall out even faster
creations-chat 2020-08-15 01:08:00 but they do automatically recover if you dont do anything
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:12:12 hm
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:12:25 i asked for helicopter specialist and i got VTOL engineer I
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 18:12:27 good enough!
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:20:03 this is the greatest plaaaaaan
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:54:10 imma make a DoG shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:54:35 the problem is idk how to make shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:59:03 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 18:59:26 yes i suck at building
creations-chat 2020-08-15 19:03:26 pRoBlEm ReCiEvInG daAtA
creations-chat 2020-08-15 19:03:48 AND ALL THE PROGRESS IS GONE
creations-chat 2020-08-15 19:03:49 GREAT
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:05:28 ffs
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:05:41 i was building a thing but roblox decided that i wasn't allowed to be connected to the server
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:05:51 and sent the error recieving whatever message
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:27:19 remaking it because i lost progress
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:33:40 active protection in PC
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:33:47 maybe have blowoff plates
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:33:56 but in a weird way
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:34:12 instead of bringing the projectile into the armor
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:34:16 throw the armor at the projectile
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 19:34:22 so it doesnt hit the main components
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 20:10:02 THIS THING IS A BIT CONFUSING TO FLY
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 20:10:05 as in its a bit impossible
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 20:10:07 idk what i did wrong
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 20:11:40 i think it sucks because i need way more weight in the segments instead of the head
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 20:24:06 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 21:22:01 why does this mans plane have so much S U C C
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 21:37:28 this is gonna be fun
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 21:38:44 he has no brim
creations-chat 2020-08-15 21:45:01 DEVOURER STUCK
creations-chat 2020-08-15 21:45:05 DEVOURER STUCK
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:03:58 bro why the fuck does your ship look like a foosball table
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:04:28 
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 22:05:32 LOOK AT THIS DUDE
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 22:05:40 HAHAHAHAHAA
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:29:30 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:29:35 how do i make this boi not jiggly
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:29:39 he kinda v i b r a t e
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:42:26 me and the boys
creations-chat 2020-08-15 22:42:28 or the boy
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:09:55 how do i put more segments into this
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:10:01 since i cant make it go around
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:10:16 it would require me to redo a pretty damn complex mechanism
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:20:47 <@!200793484053970944> its a shredder bug without the shredder
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:18 idk how to make it longer
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:20 i want to
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:27 im aiming for 10 segments
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:21:33 i think its a bit too C H O N K Y tho
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:26:59 i wish i could just copy segments
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:27:01 but no
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:41:00 this is gonna require some motorlock
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:41:07 
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:46:07 <:Menacing:644323168819085312>
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:46:16 yeah imma change the purple
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:52:42 hows this
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:52:49 imo it looks better
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:54:40 yeah ik but the thing is
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:54:55 it'd get screwy if its too dark
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:02 due to roblox's lighting system being kinda h
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:27 also for some reason changing the color also changed the weight?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:55:39 no clue what happened there but im probably gonna shove some helium blocks set to "apply to center"
creations-chat 2020-08-15 23:57:15 that did nothing

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:00 you know
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:03 making swords is getting old
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:10 but im not out of ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:11:14 a whip is just a bendy sword right?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:16:31 <@!419477639229865984> you have NO FUCKING IDEA
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:12 i have a plan.
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:50 1: take my abruhms chassis
2: add a very long whip to it
3: add a heavy weight to the end of it with a thruster to kickstart
4: explosives in the middle
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:17:59 so i can wrap the whip around somebody's build
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:06 and either yank it, explode it, or throw it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:27 either that or use the physics engine (or lack thereof) to just send them to the 5th dimension
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:48 i'll break the game in a thousand different ways
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:18:55 and find a way to weaponize every single one of them
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:19:54 im the fucking Elon Musk of bad ideas
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:22:31 how do you wear a skin tight mech control suit or whatever for hours
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:22:58 generic Mecha girls
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:23:18 d.va and that one girl who tried to sing September i forgot
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:24:45 im talking about the clothing
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:24:53 that shits gotta get sweaty right?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:25:00 or is it future tech bullshit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:26:37 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:26:52 that’s kinda errr
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:11 breathable liquid is a bit of a mess since it needs to aerosolize so we can process it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:20 but the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:24 liquid dense
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:26 gas isn’t
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:35 that shit gonna expand
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:27:50 and the cockpit is gonna get a nice new red paint job
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:20 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:32 you’re going into the horny cube before you proceed any further
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:28:36 begone
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:14 i overanalyze things before you ask
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:37 since our lungs can’t process liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:29:53 no matter how you slice it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:24 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:33 so they literally consume magic life juice
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:38 ok that makes sense
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:30:46 it’s just a catch-all clause
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:31:19 sufficiently advanced technology is basically just magic
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:03 but
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:16 wouldn’t Lilith be either in the mantle or on the moon
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:32:24 due to a planetary fucking collision
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:33:43 angles
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:31 ok im not really concerned about how the juice came to be
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:37 i want to know how it works
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:48 it’s hard to know this without watching evangelion
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:34:59 no wonder Fanta is so fucking good
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:35:04 it’s life juice
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:35:23 wait a second didn’t the Germans invent Fanta
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:36:30 you mean the weird biblical angels
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:36:43 fear not
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:37:19 it happened anyway and shit hit the fan im assuming
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:27 so basically it’s girls in mech suits breathing the life juice they came from trying to kill cursed (blessed?) onion rings
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:51 did i nail it or did i nail it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:57 uhhh
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:38:59 maybe
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:39:23 i don’t like watching anime in front of my parents they think it’s weird
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:07 ive kinda drifted away from anime in general because there’s something about it which kinda unsettles me
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:16 the perfectness of everything
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:57 like sure i still like it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:40:59 no
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:06 im not talking about the character traits
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:17 im talking about the characters themselves
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:41:29 the environment (most of the time)
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:03 i don’t like the look of perfectly polished materials and plastic skin
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:10 unless that’s what they’re going for
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:17 there’s gotta be some sort of noise
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:30 even if it’s just a filter
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:42:56 boi that’s king crimson
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:43:22 green eyes, forehead face
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:43:43 thats fucking terrifying
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:43:59 neat
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:16 wait a second
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:28 if they’re living off of good orange liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:35 and Fanta is good orange liquid
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:46 and Fanta was invented by WWII Germans
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:44:50 then does this mean
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:45:30 it’s 10:45 im not in the mood
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:45:43 tomorrow i guess ill watch

creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:46:01 tell it to me as a bet
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:46:29 you gotta bet me to watch it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:46:34 i never back down from a bet
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:46:45 bet
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:49:07 cool
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:49:19 i have no clue what was going on but it looked neat
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:00 im assuming it’s just force field shield
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:07 ok wait
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:18 what exactly is an eva
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:26 big fuckoff robot?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:34 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:50:47 im assuming this one went batshit insane
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:13 ok so basically
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:42 this bad boi just kinda tore through this anti technology shield (kinda like an EMP maybe)
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:51:55 and that was either a bad or good thing?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:52:08 ah
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:52:48 so im assuming whoever it was it was attacking wasn’t expecting it to be alive and it just kinda went through and slapped the shit out of bad guy?
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:53:08 or is that not even close
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:53:11 look man idk
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:53:22 this is probably embarrassingly wrong
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:56:20 i don’t need depression
creations-chat 2020-08-16 05:56:41 this is probably why i was attracted to jojo for a bit

creations-chat 2020-08-16 16:18:50 i like how this thing can get injured
creations-chat 2020-08-16 16:19:07 i tried coloring the insides deep purple so it looks like guts but that made it look like shit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 16:19:10 guess i forgot to remove all of it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 16:44:54 im making a smol devourer
creations-chat 2020-08-16 16:45:01 because the last one was too T H I C C

creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:07:20 im gonna need to completely rebuild the last segment though so i can make a few more fit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:08:00 atleast if you make a shredder bug it has to have some style
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:11:39 oops
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:11:46 he is unhappy
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:12:17 <@456226577798135808> ive made a giant shredder bug thats designed to eat shredder bugs whole
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:12:32 i dont have a swarm
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:13:32 the problem is that to keep aesthetics i can only put 4 cutterso n it
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:13:49 still large enough to consume YT shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 17:15:09 no
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:16:41 yep
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:16:47 rn im just trying to figure out this shit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:16:50 because the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:17:01 i dont have enough space on the side to build another segment
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:17:17 well
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:17:19 hm
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:17:23 that MIGHT work
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:19:41 the problem is
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:19:50 im trying to think up of a mechanism which would not be super unstable while flying
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:19:57 and im having a hard time doing so
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:53:57 i survived 15 seconds in the propeller
creations-chat 2020-08-16 17:53:58 god damn
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:10:13 i made a couple improvements
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:10:46 
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:17:35 <@!446358417389387776> the thing is
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:17:36 it bends
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:17:46 and i cant figure out a way to motor fold it so that it remains stable and bendy
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:17:55 if you can then im welcome to take your idea
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:00 for now tho
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:03 
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:06 i made the mouth thing open and close
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:27 
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:31 useful for grabbing onto things
creations-chat 2020-08-16 18:18:35 especially when i remove the cutters

plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:01:27 are people allowed to ram people constantly in no pvp servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:01:42 this guy named coolbdt keeps pushing everyone with a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:01:49 and a heavy tank
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:03:41 im gonna try and lengthen it
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:03:51 and by that i mean get someone to help me because i cant figure it out
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:04:28 vertical is the best option but i cant think up of a mechanism thats both stable, not very large, and will allow the worm to still bend
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:12:58 make the got damn plane longer
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:13:10 the nose is damn fine
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:13:15 but
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:13:23 too much slope behind the cockpit
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:13:25 plane is too short
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:13:59 
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:14:26 haha supercharger go A A A A A
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:17:45 this mans sea hurricane be built like a ishak
creations-chat 2020-08-16 19:31:51 why are the vip servers always dead
bot-central 2020-08-16 19:32:01 !servers
bot-central 2020-08-16 19:32:04 !vipservers
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:32:54 there are 4 cutters but theres no motors other than the jaw movers
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:33:08 i mostly use them to puncture giant builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 19:33:14 its pretty funny to grab onto them
creations-chat 2020-08-16 20:16:15 ive found a really weird issue
creations-chat 2020-08-16 20:16:26 my folded control surfaces dont respond to mouse fly commands
help 2020-08-16 20:16:51 these control surfaces dont move
help 2020-08-16 20:16:53 even when i fold them down
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 20:17:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 20:17:47 control surface machine not working
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 20:17:50 when folded downward
general 2020-08-16 21:10:58 book idea: the magic world goes to war with normal humans but they didn't account for the progression of technology
general 2020-08-16 21:11:49 imagine being (insert evil wizard here) who knows how to stop any sort of melee attack or crossbow or whatever
general 2020-08-16 21:11:57 but then you come face to face with artillery
general 2020-08-16 21:12:30 like excuse me but the bullet getting shot out of a gun goes faster than the sound that it makes
general 2020-08-16 21:12:35 theres no way you can possibly deflect or dodge that
creations-chat 2020-08-16 21:30:13 haha devourer go nom
creations-chat 2020-08-16 22:18:01 <@!456238251204935690> <:perhaps:679037242731397157>
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 22:18:22 how many more segments should i put on this thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 22:18:27 since it takes quite a bit of time to set up one
creations-chat 2020-08-16 22:19:52 i dont want to ree
creations-chat 2020-08-16 23:04:52 does it look better now
creations-chat 2020-08-16 23:08:44 
creations-chat 2020-08-16 23:24:51 why
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:25:27 why
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:27:50 its the shredder bug +
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:27:54 shredder w o r m
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:28:03 also it has 4 shredders but they're fucking useless
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:28:06 since i put them in shitty positions
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:28:09 inside the mouth
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:29:22 i figured out how to do the folding thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:29:44 so now i can put a metric fuckton of segments on this bad boi if i wanted
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:30:00 im probably just gonna make them smaller and smaller
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:31:05 scifaded
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:31:26 i could remove some of the maneuverability to add hard points
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:31:34 E:D style
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:31:52 maybe twin rockets/guns that pop out the top/bottom
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:32:29 ive probably made the best shredder bug but that isn’t saying much
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:32:37 because most of them are just swarms
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:32:51 and by best i mean not best at PvP but
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:33:00 just better
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:33:12 yup
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:33:43 it’s pretty fun to skewer myself into mechs
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:34:12 if i put some sort of conveyor engine on this i could probably shove myself into a mech and then throw it
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:34:26 or just go straight through it
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:35:31 because this thing is already bloody massive i can fit so much shit into it
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:35:50 maybe add a living room into one of the segments
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:35:56 it would fit
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:36:19 yeah imma just add some pop out guns
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:36:54 maybe some explosive charges on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:37:05 this bitch is built like a train
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:37:12 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:37:17 idk how
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:37:28 i would if i could
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:37:50 you mean railgun as in it actually works like a railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:38:05 put magnets in the barrel and slap a magnet on the ammo
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:38:18 so when i disconnect it the magnets will pull it out of the barrel
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:38:28 the only problem is that it might come back
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:39:08 is there a way to toggle magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:39:27 i might be able to set something up where the barrel is very small
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:39:33 in diameter
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:39:48 the propellant and the explosive is seperate
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:40:01 so the magnet will throw the explosive
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:40:07 but it won’t come back
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:40:34 i could also make it an autoloader
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:40:37 with that mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:40:48 carousel autoloader railgun
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:41:02 *cyka blyat noises*
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:41:26 it would be a 4 shot autoloader
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:41:49 wait a dec
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:41:59 i would have to press a few keys to load and fire it
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:42:23 clip fed
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:42:30 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:42:33 maybe
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:43:10 if i use springs with different speeds
plane-crazy 2020-08-16 23:43:20 i can push things into place at different times
creations-chat 2020-08-17 00:08:48 <@!660019099430289418> i just use a way bigger one
creations-chat 2020-08-17 00:08:53 or my sword barge

creations-chat 2020-08-17 02:57:47 but
creations-chat 2020-08-17 02:57:51 it makes the flight dynamics super weird
creations-chat 2020-08-17 02:57:58 and just annoying
creations-chat 2020-08-17 02:58:10 it loves to pull up for some reason
creations-chat 2020-08-17 02:58:24 which is fine until you turn and it pulls up like 90 degrees
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:00:07 but its either that or having to
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:00:10 spawn in like 15 times
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:06 ffs
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:10 why wont this fucking motor work
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:12 no matter what i do
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:14 its always this ONE motor
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:18 that always fucks up
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:23 and tries to go the opposite direction that i want
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:25 yes its powered
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:29 i set it to inverted
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:32 but it doesn't go inverted
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:02:35 it acts like normal
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:16 motor2
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:21 it has to be motor 2
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:23 otherwise it wont work
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:24 no
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:38 when i replace the motor it still doesnt work
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:40 forward
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:46 its the exact same as all the other motors
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:48 and those work perfectly
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:03:56 it works but not in the way i wanted it to
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:04:01 its even weirder
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:07:39 I SET YOU TO INVERTED
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:07:45 WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SO INCLINED TO NOT GO INVERTED
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:08:42 WHATS WRONG WITH THIS MOTOR?!
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:08:51 NO MATTER WHAT I DO, HOW I PLACE IT, ITS ALWAYS THIS ONE SEGMENT THAT FUCKS Up
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:08:53 AND I CANT FIX IT
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:51:50 i gave angry worm a roar
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 03:52:32 i paid 20 robux for this
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 04:01:22 its the F-4

with no physics
creations-chat 2020-08-17 13:11:47 he's becoming a bit of a chonker
creations-chat 2020-08-17 13:11:52 max speed 170
creations-chat 2020-08-17 13:11:59 vs the old 3 segment version's 300
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:15:25 C H O N K
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:17:07 also far more unstable
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:17:25 so im gonna need to stop before the thing glitches out while spawning in
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:17:45 not like it already isn't (the 2nd motor in the chain likes to ignore invert commands)
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:52:57 ffs
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:53:05 for some reason the audio i uploaded has this weird thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:53:12 the thumbnail for it has the missing file image
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:53:18 and when i try to make it work in game it doesnt play anything
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:53:58 and apparently now the file is blocked
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:54:00 what the hell
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 13:54:07 why does roblox moderate random audio files
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 14:06:43 especially when 90% of them are just YT shredder bugs with a "cool" paint job
plane-crazy 2020-08-17 14:07:06 also known as: you painted all of it black and then put a few min-max colors on it

creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:03:14 he uses a shredder bug sword thing that has a massive cube of cameras around it so it cant fall apart
creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:03:30 and now he's RKing the entire server
creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:04:42 oh for the love of god
creations-chat 2020-10-12 03:04:58 even my 7 sword abrams cant kill it, it literally doesn't die
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:06:24 ugh
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:06:31 this is why PVP sucks
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:06:50 this guy has a shredder bug with massive cubes of cameras around the thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:06:52 so it can't fall apart
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:07:05 all the parts stay attached and you can't do anything about it
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:07:12 multiple direct hits from even some of my swords do nothing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:07:29 and the blade itself cannot break, as it's permanently connected by cameras
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:15:43 i normally use my terra blade abrams to delete shredder bugs but this one just doesnt die
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:15:47 due to the camera shenanigans
general 2020-10-12 12:55:00 i made things
general 2020-10-12 12:55:05

general 2020-10-12 12:58:46 i have no clue how its that fast
general 2020-10-12 12:59:05 im pretty sure the fucking gaming chair god blessed me with a holy wifi stick
general 2020-10-12 12:59:11 and now i get 130mbps

general 2020-10-12 12:59:22 <@!351809528209080324> nO
general 2020-10-12 12:59:39 ah
general 2020-10-12 12:59:46 not too much of a problem but still a problem
general 2020-10-12 13:00:09 
general 2020-10-12 13:00:35 last time i checked its not very easy to get the location of someone
general 2020-10-12 13:00:46 and plus
general 2020-10-12 13:00:53 i would have been doxxed a long time ago
general 2020-10-12 13:01:05 a ton of minecraft servers show IPs when they ban a player
general 2020-10-12 13:01:49 yeahhhh IP addresses don't do shit
general 2020-10-12 13:01:59 you can't get any information off of them or by doing anything with them
general 2020-10-12 13:02:02 only find the city someone lives in
general 2020-10-12 13:02:46 to properly doxx someone with an ip, you have to threaten them with being doxxed
general 2020-10-12 13:02:52 then get them to spill their information out of fear
general 2020-10-12 13:02:58 when they were never at risk in the first place
general 2020-10-12 13:03:11 DDOSing is another problem
general 2020-10-12 13:03:26 all you did is shut off their internet
general 2020-10-12 13:03:33 what
general 2020-10-12 13:03:37 i said l o l i p o p
general 2020-10-12 13:03:44 why is that censored
general 2020-10-12 13:03:57 me
general 2020-10-12 13:04:08 had to restart the modem
general 2020-10-12 13:04:10 or router
general 2020-10-12 13:04:11 idfk
general 2020-10-12 13:04:25 i just restarted whatever it was and it worked
general 2020-10-12 13:04:35 and by that i mean my dad made me press a button because he held me responsible
general 2020-10-12 13:05:02 most likely
general 2020-10-12 13:05:05 probably a script kiddie
general 2020-10-12 13:05:10 since it was GTA online
general 2020-10-12 13:05:18 this dude was a solid 12 years old
general 2020-10-12 13:06:11 the "worst" thing thats happened to me by accidently doxxing myself was showing my personal information to some of my real life friends in a call (wasn't really a doxx since they know the general neighborhood where i lived and they went over to my house but forgot where it was)
general 2020-10-12 13:06:16 but they ordered me a free pizza
general 2020-10-12 13:06:37 oh fuck my dad told me a story about doing that
general 2020-10-12 13:06:50 except
general 2020-10-12 13:06:54 this wasn't "back in the day"
general 2020-10-12 13:07:06 you know how TV remotes work
general 2020-10-12 13:07:15 they use specific frequencies of IR light
general 2020-10-12 13:07:43 he found someone with a really old TV
general 2020-10-12 13:07:45 also known as my grandpa
general 2020-10-12 13:07:58 not TOO old but old enough to have no restrictions
general 2020-10-12 13:08:18 so he used an IR lamp hooked up to a circuit board to completely fuck with the TV before buying him a new one
general 2020-10-12 13:08:28 basically just strobing it
general 2020-10-12 13:09:45 btw if someone is hellbent on doxxing you a VPN wont stop him
general 2020-10-12 13:10:03 apparently there are ways to track down people even when they use a VPN
general 2020-10-12 13:11:31 they suckle on my life essence and then fly away
general 2020-10-12 13:12:05 they only overflow when a certain nerve is severed
general 2020-10-12 13:12:11 they just keep drinking until they delete
general 2020-10-12 13:12:22 it can happen randomly with a collision or attack
general 2020-10-12 13:12:30 or they get cut manually
general 2020-10-12 13:12:55 is this technically gore
general 2020-10-12 13:13:20 it aint bad but its still blood and discord moderators do be discord moderators
general 2020-10-12 13:15:13 flies are necessary
general 2020-10-12 13:15:25 mosquitoes are just pollinators for a few specific crops
general 2020-10-12 13:15:32 flies decompose meat and shit
general 2020-10-12 13:15:38 which is really important
general 2020-10-12 13:15:50 it doesnt hurt until afterwards
general 2020-10-12 13:15:54 and even then hurt is a strong word
general 2020-10-12 13:16:29 i had a jumping spider that lived at my desk for a few weeks until it died
general 2020-10-12 13:16:32 i fed it crumbs
general 2020-10-12 13:17:00 <@!446205377604878336> huh
general 2020-10-12 13:17:02 then why did they
general 2020-10-12 13:17:11 either that or it wasn't crumbs
general 2020-10-12 13:17:13 and some fuckin
general 2020-10-12 13:17:17 ah
general 2020-10-12 13:17:22 then what happened?
general 2020-10-12 13:17:26 maybe it wasn't a jumping spider idfk
general 2020-10-12 13:17:41 it was some sort of something that looked like a spider and it ate very smol pieces of food when i put it infront
general 2020-10-12 13:17:49 it probably was not a spider
general 2020-10-12 13:17:55 i just assume it is because it looked kinda fluffy
general 2020-10-12 13:18:09 well

general 2020-10-12 13:21:20 but spiders good
general 2020-10-12 13:21:31 they're only bad when they decide that everything dies

general 2020-10-12 13:25:56 im pretty sure the blobfish image is a bad example
general 2020-10-12 13:26:00 since that blobfish was dead as fucc
general 2020-10-12 13:26:14 and kinda exploded due to the pressure difference

creations-chat 2020-10-12 13:44:52 <@!409676438682206218> probably because SU was kinda pandering towards LGBTQ
creations-chat 2020-10-12 13:45:22 which is nice and all until the show gets banned in a shitload of countries worldwide and grows a massive amount of controversy (as well as its horrible message for just crying all your problems away)
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:16 neither
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:24 null speed and infinite speed can't really be measured
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:31 as they're an error of programming instead of an actual number
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:42 null especially, thats the *lack* of a data value
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:52 but not in the way that zero is a lack of a number
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:46:57 there is no number there in the first place
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:15:12 what should i try making next
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:15:33 no
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:15:52 i cannot do that much detail
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:16:29 and plus i kinda just suck at making planes anyway
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:16:46 i need to figure out how to motorlock first lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:17:02 ftrookie does it have the suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:18:06 so what do i make next that isn't an SU-30
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:19:06 i would try to make a prop fighter but the problem is propellers are hard to make

creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:27:45 im trying to make a yak-15 but i dont know how to make the 1-wide cockpit
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:28:17 yes but this
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:28:33 im physically not able to make that shape
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:33:16 some assembly required
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:33:31 how do i make it not do that
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:34:46 i cant fucking make these trap doors work
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:35:02 no matter how i place them
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:35:40 this is why i hate making planes, 90% of them are 1 block wide and i can never make them properly
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:35:57 how do you even open a cockpit on a 1-wide plane
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:36:29 <@!720891502108344360> no amount of motor lock i can think of can make a 1-wide cockpit open without any parts sticking out
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:36:45 it'll just get stuck because theres always atleast one piece of fuselage in the way
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:37:09 and i hate this game because no matter what i do i have to learn how to motorlock or i can never make a half decent creation compared to anything else
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:37:25 and by learn i mean master every single god damn little niche of it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:37:49 ***HOW DO YOU PUT LADDERS ON AN ANGLE WHAT THE FUCK***
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:38:42 why is the answer to everything in this godforsaken game motorlock
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:39:04 *how* does the motorlock work, i need more detail
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:39:19 its like saying "get good" on a guide on how to get better
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:41:30 shut up rookie
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:42:13 i cant handle this fucking discord server anymore
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:42:54 nobody knows how to describe what they're doing and the ones who do never want to
everybody is some level of asshole
creations-chat 2020-10-13 01:43:53 mOtOrLocK
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:44:56 and the only damn answer to any question is "jUsT motorlOck It hEhehohO"
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:45:04 which isn't helpful at all
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:05 seriously how does one motorlock a 1 wide plane to make the cockpit open or have the wings the right shape or fit the components in
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:10 there isn't enough space for the motorlock itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:19 and everything will be exposed outward
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:39 any WW2 fighter
creations-chat 2020-10-13 02:06:21 how do i make a propeller for this that doesn't completely spin out
creations-chat 2020-10-13 02:10:00 <@!614659754249420810> just saying the word motorlock doesn't help
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:22:28 why is 16clampa being downvoted

plane-crazy 2020-10-14 02:33:24 im confused
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 02:33:40 what do you need to motor lock, why do you need to compress it, and what do i compress
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 02:35:35 that doesn't answer my question
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 02:35:39 why is motorlocking always so vague

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:44:49 how do i build a T-80 turret
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:45:24 the first layer is fine but the second layer is yikes
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:45:32 its curved
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:46:34 oh for fucks sake
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:46:41 you aren't helping by just saying the word motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:46:46 how many times do i have to tell you this
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:46:47 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:46:59 why do i need to delay it
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:47:01 what do i motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:47:08 how do i get the correct curved top with the shapes i have
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:48:05 yes but what the fuck do i do to get the correct shape
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:48:09 i dont have enough parts
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:48:29 the sides are fine enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:48:31 the corners are AAAAA
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:50:01 so just redo the entire damn build
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:50:13 because i cant get 4 corners correct
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:50:26 give me a sec
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:50:33 imma see if i can brute force my way without extreme amounts of motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:51:00 im still gonna use motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:51:05 just less because for me its extremely hard to understand
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:54:25 cursed turret?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 02:54:35 it looks nothing like a T-80 turret

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:07:40 i attempted to make a T-80
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:07:53 suspension is a bit high
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:10:13 fixed the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:10:32 the turret is completely wrong but i can't really fix
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 05:34:05 imma fucking add an abrams turret to my T-80 tomorrow

general 2020-10-17 16:59:22 better than nothing tho
general 2020-10-17 16:59:34 isn't torsion bar just the wheels rotating upward
general 2020-10-17 16:59:42 with something to stop them at the peak
general 2020-10-17 17:00:36 <@!389756407483990028> im pretty sure the spring is a suspension block going from the torsion bar itself to the motors that drive the wheel
general 2020-10-17 17:00:43 and set on high stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 23:25:42 is it possible to motorlock something by a quarter of a block
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 23:27:17 how
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 23:27:54 like?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 23:28:18 good

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 18:56:06 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 18:56:20 when i pitch up and then level out it tries to pitch down
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 18:56:21 and then up
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 18:56:23 over and over
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 18:56:26 and im using max torque
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 19:01:11 oh wait nvm that problem fixed itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 19:01:24 i just decreased the maximum angle by a little bit
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 19:01:38 it wont turn as tight but its a twin engine fighter
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 19:01:42 why do i need it to turn tight
creations-chat 2020-10-18 19:18:35 my attempt at an Me 262 HG III, with a custom paintjob (if you don't know what that plane is, pretty much just an extremely fast Me 262)

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:30:19 and you've seen some of my creations i make that aren't just fucking memes i threw up in 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:32:10 is it ok to repost
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:32:43 yup
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:33:03 thats the type of chaotic shit i would make if i was slightly better
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:33:21 instead of Strv 103 turrets and KV-2-2-2s and Me 163s built like 262s
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:35:20 oh right
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:35:26 the L O N G T 3 4
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:35:37 i want to make it even longer but folding suspension would be absolute hell
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:35:50 WAIT I KNOW WHAT TO MAKE
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:35:53 P-51 HELICOPTER

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:03 i want to make a functional AAM
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:10 but i dont think autotracking is possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:14 it'd have to be command guided
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:17 unless
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:22 its extremely heavy
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:27 and if i give it thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:43 i could point the engine in the direction it needs to go
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:40:46 and let the wings do the rest

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:26:05 my first plane was a VTOL surprisingly
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:26:15 it flew really well but looked like crap

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:28:12 my first actual plane that wasn't the starter plane was a vtol that i recently overwrote in place of my Me 163
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:31:40 the 3rd plane i made was a fucking flying tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:31:48 that shot TNT with a spring
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:31:54 i only managed to land one air to air kill with it
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:32:03 the awful part is
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:32:07 the turret didn't rotate with the mouse cursor
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:32:11 ***it was manual aiming***

general 2020-11-12 04:16:54 Boeing 737 but with one singular GE90 engine instead of the cockpit
general 2020-11-12 04:17:30 wait
general 2020-11-12 04:17:32 why stop there
general 2020-11-12 04:17:39 i already made a long T-34 hull
general 2020-11-12 04:17:44 amphibious capable
general 2020-11-12 04:17:47 kinda like that
general 2020-11-12 04:18:01 maybe i should just make my long T-34 into a battleship
general 2020-11-12 04:18:07 bridge and all
general 2020-11-12 04:18:38 at the gate it just turns on the engine
general 2020-11-12 04:18:45 and sucks everyone into the cabin
general 2020-11-12 04:19:37 food i made earlier
general 2020-11-12 04:20:22 
general 2020-11-12 04:20:27 fuel shortage my ass
general 2020-11-12 04:22:21 you know that T-34 with two mig-21 engines strapped on
general 2020-11-12 04:22:38 that but it’s a whole ass USS Iowa with J-79s
general 2020-11-12 04:23:00 that’s just an ATGM carrier
general 2020-11-12 04:23:13 or a katyusha depending on the era
general 2020-11-12 04:24:36 long 76
general 2020-11-12 04:24:52 yes it’s actually 76mm
general 2020-11-12 04:25:17 why not
general 2020-11-12 04:25:40 i already got a gun mantlet for it
general 2020-11-12 04:25:42 also it does shoot
general 2020-11-12 04:25:48 APDS
general 2020-11-12 04:26:45 that’s the type of shit that will make a MiG-21 do combat turn
general 2020-11-12 04:26:48 and drop a bomb
general 2020-11-12 04:26:54 you imbecile

general 2020-11-12 04:35:05 it’s approximately 3 miles and 7 weeks away from me
general 2020-11-12 04:36:11 reject humanity

general 2020-11-12 04:37:04 pretty much is except 5 fingers instead of two
general 2020-11-12 04:37:28 it’s also 100% fabric or polyester
general 2020-11-12 04:37:34 yes
general 2020-11-12 04:37:40 did you not get the memo
general 2020-11-12 04:37:43 i am a furry
general 2020-11-12 04:37:51 
general 2020-11-12 04:38:06 yes it’s made out of cardboard
general 2020-11-12 04:38:19 yes i made it in about 2 hours
general 2020-11-12 04:38:25 in total
general 2020-11-12 04:38:32 it fits
general 2020-11-12 04:38:34 it sits
general 2020-11-12 04:39:02 also no i don’t have any artistic skill
general 2020-11-12 04:39:21 i just have a minute amount of engineering skill
general 2020-11-12 04:39:47 the engineer is engihere
general 2020-11-12 04:40:23 the engineer
bot-central 2020-11-12 04:45:29 why
bot-central 2020-11-12 04:46:01 yes that’s an infinity dodecahedron
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 04:46:50 i also made this big fuckoff garlic bread loaf
general 2020-11-12 04:53:32 first of all
general 2020-11-12 04:53:34 how
general 2020-11-12 04:53:38 second of all
general 2020-11-12 04:53:39 the fuck
general 2020-11-12 04:54:09 build a boat is pure paywall
general 2020-11-12 04:54:55 fuck motorlock
general 2020-11-12 04:55:06 motor oil is where it’s at
general 2020-11-12 04:55:28 the difference is
general 2020-11-12 04:55:35 BaB gets precision placement
general 2020-11-12 04:55:51 plane crazy needs different precision modes
general 2020-11-12 04:55:54 how about that
general 2020-11-12 04:56:29 hey hey hey calm down
general 2020-11-12 04:56:34 i know what we can do
general 2020-11-12 04:56:43 to make plane crazy better
general 2020-11-12 04:56:54 add 0.1 grid snapping
general 2020-11-12 04:58:12 give us
general 2020-11-12 04:58:19 0.25 snapping
general 2020-11-12 04:58:40 plane crazy with quarter precision would be fucking insane
general 2020-11-12 04:59:24 we also need a variable block but that ain’t happening
general 2020-11-12 04:59:46 the only way to get immense detail is to make immense size
general 2020-11-12 05:00:08 this is not starship EXO
general 2020-11-12 05:00:12 this is plane crazy
general 2020-11-12 05:00:31 Toni
general 2020-11-12 05:00:34 tonk
general 2020-11-12 05:00:36 tonk
general 2020-11-12 05:00:38 tonk
general 2020-11-12 05:06:45 can we talk about WFYB
general 2020-11-12 05:07:04 it’s the middle ground
general 2020-11-12 05:07:59 precision but without immense complexity, no constraints but also they aren’t necessary, a decently large community of bad and good builders, and it isn’t P2W
general 2020-11-12 05:08:31 and the placement bugs are quite nice
general 2020-11-12 05:09:40 PC gets motorlock but WFYB gets intersecting parts, relative angled placements, and semi custom curves
general 2020-11-12 05:33:54 <@!588055079899103299> don’t panic
general 2020-11-12 05:34:06 so basically
general 2020-11-12 05:34:18 tank suspension at its simplest is very easy
general 2020-11-12 05:34:30 ok wait
general 2020-11-12 05:34:41 <@456226577798135808> there’s an expert vip server?
general 2020-11-12 05:34:52 oh

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 12:27:10 that slopes upwards
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 12:27:22 unless i do some insane foldy shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 12:32:54 <@!224513422161739776> i WOULD use motorlock but i dont really know how to pull that precise shit off rn
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 12:33:01 all i know is how to stack parts on eachother
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 12:46:57 im making waffentiger II

plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:47:25 that isn't a good reason <@!723419054114865202>
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:47:53 can't rickje make them strong
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:47:59 or is it another hardcoded bullshit
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:48:04 how do you even hardcode something like that
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:48:09 its a *variable*
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:48:16 how do you hardcode a *variable*
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:48:46 if you manage to fuck up by hardcoding the things that can easily be not hardcoded
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:48:52 you're just a bad programmer

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:05:47 conveyor belt engines don't spin
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:06:00 so basically its just a really fast spinning object

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:06:13 that's super hard to kill
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:06:17 because it's spinning super fast

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:07:25 i think i've analyzed this well enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:07:32 this object is very hollow and spins around extremely fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:07:49 missiles can't really hit it due to the spinning and hollowness
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:07:55 and in ball form its smooth
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:08:05 i know how to defeat it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:08:24 just use a guided missile
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:08:29 manually guided missile
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:08:37 explosions should be able to kill it easily
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:08:52 my sword might be able to kill it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:09:09 im still the best swordsman
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:09:27 actually no
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:09:37 this is a super advanced build using custom angles and shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:09:45 basically nobody will be able to recreate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:09:53 guns could theoretically work
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:10:27 how fast does it move
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:10:40 does it have 6DoF movement or is it restricted
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:11:53 they wont spread
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:11:55 stop overreacting
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:12:03 just blacklist and you'll be able to kill them easily
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:13:28 yet again
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 00:13:32 they wont
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:20:40 
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:20:42 turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:20:59 
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:21:32 shredder bugs get killed by ERA
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:22:04 TNT armor is very strong against rockets and setting the blast radius to something extremely low but still enough to damage whatever hits it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:22:11 shredder bugs will just explode
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:22:54 <@!224513422161739776> kinda?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:23:14 loose ladders are fucking annoying to get through
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:23:20 with any cutter
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:23:28 even my big fuckoff sword has a little bit of trouble
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:27:21 should i just fuck the chassis and put tracks directly on the turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:33:04 TONK
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:33:15 its a custom turret heavily based off the leopard 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 01:40:26 
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 02:21:43 what type of tank is this
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 02:22:01 whatever hood you've made mine is already better
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 03:14:14 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 04:51:01 i was literally too lazy to build the rest of the tank so i just put the turret on wheels
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:01 oh boy
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:06 another day another project
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:10 what to make tomorrow?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:33 perhaps a giant enemy spider
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:38 but mechs are hard
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:34:56 you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:35:12 <@!707991071476547745> hey
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:35:18 the fuck do i make tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:36:46 i have a design in my head
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:36:56 im probably gonna need to do some lucid dream engineering shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:37:11 for mech legs
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:37:18 if it uses lots of suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:37:25 maybe use pistons to push and pull the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:37:49 i need to figure out how to balance it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:38:00 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:38:16 i could try just sending the center of mass into the outer core
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:38:45 and by outer core i don’t mean in the pelvis
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:38:49 i mean half way to China
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:39:32 either that or i could make a fuckin uhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:39:38 race van
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:39:48 vanborghini
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:39:54 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:40:29 so mech legs are fuckin uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:40:35 how about uhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:40:40 rope constraints
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:18 i know what to do
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:24 make a mechanical hand
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:35 using far too many locked motor1s
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:43 and servos
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:52 im not making another tonk
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:41:56 ive made two
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:43:14 ive made 4 tanks, 2 TDs, two tonks, and one taaaaaank
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:43:35 or the 🅱️attleship
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:43:56 ill make a mechanical hand
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 05:44:05 just so i can yeet a can of Bepis
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:04:35 that'd just be mechanical ground effect
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:04:58 they won't
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 18:57:08 why not put TNT armor inside the tank and just make the tank bigger
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 18:57:19 or even better: put it on the sides like flaps

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 20:10:32 as soon as i left they joined

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 20:11:55 nvm that broke
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:15:05 he will shoot you
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:44:43 should i make a hull for this turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 03:35:53 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 03:36:20 vongo metal be like
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:15:17 another day another cursed meme contraption
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:15:20 what do i make next
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:15:23 for tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:15:38 i already made my mechanical hand that was made for the express purpose of YEETING a can of soda
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:17:33 i think its time i make a cursed plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:17:59 something vtol
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:00 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:31 should i try making a harrier built like a WWII prop plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:44 hm
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:19:14 harrier with non-swept wings, 2 propellers that swing downward
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:19:21 cage cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:20:51 kinda except way smaller
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:20:56 and the engines are under the wings instead of on the wingtips
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:21:11 osprey except harrier ig
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:31:22 y’all in creations are dense
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:31:40 you downvote “shitty” contraptions because of a paint job or a blocky shape
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:32:13 a lot still have a ton of effort put into them and a lot are very creative
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:32:31 i personally like the worse looking contraptions because they tend to have really nice designs
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:32:41 id love to remake some of them
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:33:41 <@696095829345173605> try making the wings a single angle
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:34:57 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/777388198124716062/20201115_122052.png
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:35:02 this monster truck
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:35:05 i really like it
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:35:34 it’s a simple design, looks like a monster truck, good proportions and a decent amount of detail
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:37:29 that suspension is a bit yikes yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:38:32 <@!581482243101294592> try remaking the suspension by having each wheel be independent and connect the front two suspensions with a bar
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:38:42 then make that bar have a motor2 servo on it
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:15 pretty much is
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:21 super basic and it works well enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:41 it’s the simplest suspension system that isn’t just chassis connected to hull
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:52 that still allows front or back wheel steering
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:40:04 with custom wheels

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:42:32 robostalin
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:42:36 i fucking love that
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:42:45 the only problem is the abhorrent paint job
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:42:56 he needs some 85-95-80 in his life
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:43:03 it’s so creative though
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:43:44 <@!658336793812271114> try using 85 red 95 green 80 blue for the paint
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:43:50 it looks a lot nicer
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:44:01 or maybe 85 95 75
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:44:15 why do tanks get more blue as time goes on
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:44:58 the default orange-yellow paint is actually a perfect yellow
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:05 the blue is fucked though
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:19 and that navy color is damn hard to get right
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:42 wait i know what to do for my next build now
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:54 mig-15 with yak-3 wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:59 or just
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:46:12 mig-15 built like an old yak
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:46:59 or maybe the turbobolt
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:10:42 i still don’t know what cursed thing to make tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:10:45 uhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:11:17 so i got the turbobolt, WWII harrier, or finishing up a tank chassis
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:11:22 for my current inventory
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:11:58 hey you
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:12:02 what do i make
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:15:38 hm

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 19:58:11 <@456226577798135808> should i make a tiny HMS hood

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 19:58:27 how small should it be
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 19:59:25 uhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 20:24:40 im trying to make a tiny ass hood
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 20:24:46 i have a feeling its too small
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 20:35:55 making an HMS hood thats 36 blocks long was a mistake

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:00:06 any recommendations for changing the body of the tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:00:08 the turret is cursed as hell
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:01:30 are there any modern tanks with stubby turrets
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:10:07 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 02:33:36 imma try making a cursed modernized tiger

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:25:36 a fuckton of wings, control surfaces, and 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:31:18 you have access to a vip server though
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:31:37 do !servers in <#384027830192832513>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:41:09 scal already lookin pog
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:41:42 btw <@!432344306427101184> how do you make yours float
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:43:02 this aint a worm
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:43:37 also someone named creapycrea made a teleportation engine
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:43:50 that uses an altered form of the anchor teleportation glitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:43:55 i don't know how it works quite yet
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:44:12 but it basically allows you to teleport wherever the craft is facing at a set distance
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:44:21 or until it bumps into something
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 22:44:24 or it completely glitches out
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 23:11:53 how do i make something stay upright

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 04:18:21 gamer moment

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 04:18:38 this is a bit long overdue but i mean
general 2020-12-10 03:14:02 i set up dolphin emulator and got an SMG2 ISO just to reach here
general 2020-12-10 03:14:52 now i am worthy
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:07:56 why do people downvote creations just because theres another creation in the picture
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:08:15 i've noticed that happens quite a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:09:08 what?
creations-chat 2020-12-10 16:10:52 hm
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:12:12 im probably missing something then
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:12:14 also
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:12:20 why does this guy only have designer IV
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:13:13 the shape and detail is really good
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:13:23 but yeah i can agree that it doesn't deserve *THAT* many upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:14:24 i could theoretically get HoF for 2 of my creations
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:14:27 but i sure as hell won't
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:16:04 im still confused on how my F-82 spin mustang got 80 upvotes

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:19:37 and why does THIS have 72 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:19:40 it's probably sheer and utter nostalgia
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 16:20:39 maybe i should try to make the world 6 map

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:42:20 i’m making the mother of all shredder bugs rn so
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:42:54 this plus a wip tailpiece
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:43:23 it literally is
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:43:36 the doggo
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:44:20 i also got supreme calamitas but the old design
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:44:27 i’m not making a mech for the new one
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:44:59 the only reason my creation works as a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:45:17 i can just lock the mandibles into something and then abuse the OPness that is flammenwerfer
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:45:53 and i don’t give two flying fucks about a tutorial creation or lack thereof you PvP addicted elitist
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:45:56 lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:46:21 he did it
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:46:23 he did the thing
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:46:25 do it now
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:48:13 i upvote creations of inexperienced builders who make something cool but don’t paint it properly 😎
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:48:43 it legit goes 120 top speed
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:49:16 i can glitch the mandibles if they’re stuck inside something and just send whatever is on it to brazil
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:49:21 but not exactly reliable
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:49:53 for anti-shredder i usually just use my tank sword
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:50:02 who cares
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:50:30 it doesn’t matter how many shredders you put on your ram build
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:50:38 it will get deactivated in one hit
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:50:57 unless it’s one of those really annoying ones that use rotor glitches to spin at impossible speeds
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:51:19 or one of those death orbs that just send your creation to the void on contact
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:51:24 who cares
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:51:39 btw, creations blacklist

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:52:45 there aren’t any tutorials and i only know two players with them
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 03:52:52 3: no respect

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 13:49:00 well, angy in general
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 13:49:09 seriously, why df did this get 14 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-02-11 13:49:38 everything that isn't a god tier build is getting downvoted nowadays

why did that amazing omega mech get 14 downvotes
creations-chat 2022-02-11 13:51:43 pcc standards going up too high

all the inexperienced builders with potential are getting demoralized
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 13:53:48 
creations-chat 2022-02-11 13:56:49 i mean yeah but the good builds are getting better, but the center of the bell curve for votes is currently like -10 to -15 rn
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 15:31:16 do conveyor engines work on worms or do they freak the fuck out
creations-chat 2022-02-11 19:01:43 someone deleted the 30 or so upvotes on my creation

what happened
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:02:41 why did all the upvotes on my recent creation just disappear
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:02:51 it went from 30-40 to 2
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:05:08 i am very confused
general 2022-02-11 19:05:52 who removed the upvotes on my creation
general 2022-02-11 19:06:14 it went from 30-40 upvotes to 2-3 instantly
general 2022-02-11 19:06:17 what df happened
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:07:21 do mods remove upvotes on creations or smth?
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 19:07:49 because that would explain why a few really good creations i see have like 5 upvotes
creations-chat 2022-02-11 19:08:57 does anyone have a decent answer or is this some moderation bs

contest-chat 2022-04-04 17:19:18 watch as the top 1 winner is some random russian WWII tank but with wings and a thruster
contest-chat 2022-04-04 17:20:11 yeah but this is plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-04-04 17:20:17 you gotta remember that nobody actually builds planes

contest-chat 2022-04-04 17:20:52 i’m joking
contest-chat 2022-04-04 17:21:15 the joke is that plane crazy players like building ground vehicles

creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:16:08 all the cutters on it are decorative
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:19:17 how did you make it circular
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:21:35 <@793371011029925948> nice plane

you gotta give the inexperienced builders credit, boney did the best he could without really knowing what motorlock is afaik

and the colors are decent too
creations-chat 2022-04-09 04:28:34 oh i forgot about that, i don't see many people actually rotating their motorlock to make circles like that
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 05:09:36 chess.
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:23 so i only just realized now
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:31 i pretty much just made a giant ass shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:35 while trying to make a worm
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:06:14 sad space worm wants a food
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:10:48 53 downvotes last time i checked
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:10:53 because it has cutters on it
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:11:18 they're legit decorative
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:11:22 how else do i make spikes/edges
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:11:48 also this
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:12:42 it's not even for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:12:46 which is the funniest part
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:12:52 this shit does *NOT* fly stable
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:13:24 i filled my supreme calamitas thing with cutters
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:13:29 specifically for that reason
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:13:43 anti-shredder and anti-blacklist
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:14:03 but i have camera shields on it
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:14:14 so shredders usually end up getting stuck just out of reach of the main body
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:14:24 while being *very* confused
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:14:49 i had one kid accuse me of using physics hacks
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:15:02 because i had no gravity and they couldn't use their shredder on my build effectively
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:05 the best part about it
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:09 if someone is able to destroy the shield
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:20 i may not have a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:34 but i have an anchor
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:37 for use with a piston "teleporter"
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:16:48 and it's way more effective without the insane weight
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:17:46 do it
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:17:56 but don't make the same mistake i made while making doggo
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:18:05 massive segments make for lots of inertia
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:18:10 and your worm will turn into a shrimp
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:18:47 no no
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:18:51 well actually yeah
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:01 make the segments at MAX 5x7-8
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:15 i'd recommend 3x4/3x5 without decorations
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:25 with decorations it'll be larger but
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:30 those are low weight so it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:44 eh
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:19:49 rope ends up getting super glitchy super quick
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:20:00 and you can't limit them
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:20:09 so you can end up just folding the worm
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:20:38 free swinging but use motor2 for vertical movement and motor1 for horizontal
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:20:50 because you can limit motor2's movement
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:20:58 but the segments themselves will limit the horizontal movement
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:23:41 it's very simple
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:23:43 you don't
plane-crazy 2022-04-10 18:23:48 set max torque and speed to 0

plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:44:08 it can now time travel with full FX
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:44:24 when it vanishes it leaves a few trails going forward and has a good chance of crashing the game of whoever’s in the passenger seat
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:44:26 sadly
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:44:54 just using a few glitches to accelerate it to millions of studs per second instantly
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:45:09 so it looks like it just disappears into a flash of light
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 04:57:17 it’s very confusing

why does this have 88 downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:57:21 i feel as if plane crazy has became too harsh
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:57:29 it’s all camera locking now
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:57:45 and insanely detailed mechanically functional crafts that are well over 1000 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:57:55 and/or ro-scale
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:58:03 well, camera locking, piston, angle, etc
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:58:28 99% of the builds i made a few months ago would get hundreds of downvotes if i posted them now
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:58:34 even if they were successful in the past
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:59:45 the game no longer has any creativity either
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 18:59:57 its either make a modern fighter jet or MBT
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:00:03 or maybe even an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:00:14 or the build is garbage because it ain’t real/realistic
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:00:41 any bright color is now bad and should never be used
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:00:58 it doesn’t feel like a roblox game about building fun, creative physics crafts
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:01:02 it just feels like war thunder x ksp
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:01:43 well here’s the thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:01:48 the only reason why it’s like this
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:01:54 is because there isn’t any better alternative
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:02:05 on roblox
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:02:14 it’s art through restriction of medium
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:02:16 but
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:02:21 at this point just make art

plane-crazy 2022-09-27 19:03:38 oh wait this is plane crazy chat i forgor
general 2022-09-27 19:04:05 there should be a game about building military vehicles on roblox
general 2022-09-27 19:04:17 with plane crazy levels of freedom
general 2022-09-27 19:04:29 because plane crazy itself is flawed
general 2022-09-27 19:04:47 you have to use like 3 different glitches minimum to make a build look good
general 2022-09-27 19:04:50 that shouldn’t be a thing
general 2022-09-27 19:04:57 just make a better builder
general 2022-09-27 19:05:31 why is that a bad thing
general 2022-09-27 19:05:45 and sure, you can be good at construction
general 2022-09-27 19:05:51 but that doesn’t mean you’re good at design
general 2022-09-27 19:06:29 yeah but you get what i mean
general 2022-09-27 19:06:50 camera, piston, and angle locking were all emergent off that emergent feature as well
general 2022-09-27 19:07:18 apparently planme game will be pretty good

general 2022-10-25 15:41:31 made a rig for skeletron which was just a mostly 2D plane stood upright with some platforms
general 2022-10-25 15:41:38 the arms had guns on them
general 2022-10-25 15:41:48 so if they’d pass behind a player it’d damage them
general 2022-10-25 15:42:22 or just the black main space
general 2022-10-25 15:42:47 the exo mechs
general 2022-10-25 15:43:18 i’ve gotten a little better at building over time at least
general 2022-10-25 15:43:24 when i actually bother trying that is
general 2022-10-25 15:43:51 make a solar system
general 2022-10-25 15:43:54 do you have gravity gamepass
general 2022-10-25 15:44:05 if not just vip
general 2022-10-25 15:44:20 magnets can orbit each other in no gravity
general 2022-10-25 15:44:59 actually there’s something i gotta finish
general 2022-10-25 15:45:04 using a half piston glitch
general 2022-10-25 15:45:18 a cube that i can walk around any surface from other players perspective
general 2022-10-25 15:45:41 pls don’t make it a shredder swarm
general 2022-10-25 15:46:41 zero effort build
general 2022-10-25 15:47:41 oooohhh
general 2022-10-25 15:47:48 put a teleporter device into them
general 2022-10-25 15:48:13 and add the gyro control
general 2022-10-25 15:48:27 a weird ass bug
general 2022-10-25 15:48:36 i used it to make my functional delorean
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 15:50:13 wrong channel
general 2022-10-25 15:50:19 
general 2022-10-25 15:50:20 how do you think i made this
general 2022-10-25 15:50:40 i can help design the technical aspects
general 2022-10-25 15:50:44 you make the aesthetics
general 2022-10-25 15:51:05 in supreme calamitas i used an omnidirectional gyroscope
general 2022-10-25 15:51:12 fancy words for heavy block that spins the craft around it
general 2022-10-25 15:51:35 for the gyro or for calamitas
general 2022-10-25 15:51:44 yeah if i can find it
general 2022-10-25 15:51:53 i’ll see what i can do when i get home
general 2022-10-25 15:52:18 but it’s basically just using suspension and motor2 to spin around a heavy object
general 2022-10-25 15:52:25 the heavy object is hidden inside the craft
general 2022-10-25 15:53:50 the tutorial omni shredder has one of those gyros
general 2022-10-25 15:54:03 well
general 2022-10-25 15:54:07 it IS one of them
general 2022-10-25 15:54:18 it’s a big ass gyro with cutters on them
general 2022-10-25 15:54:21 but
general 2022-10-25 15:54:27 it’s a horrible use for such technology
general 2022-10-25 15:54:57 rocket
general 2022-10-25 22:27:59 yes

plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:16:42 camera lock is an odious concept
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 16:16:46 i choose to ignore it
general 2022-10-26 16:21:23 motorlock is dumb

simply try harder
general 2022-10-26 20:29:23 bulk detonator
general 2022-10-26 20:29:57 “guys look at my F-16 it’s not tutorial trust”
general 2022-10-26 20:30:01 or even better
general 2022-10-26 20:30:15 “custom” jets
general 2022-10-26 20:30:21 inspired by X or Y
general 2022-10-26 20:30:51 people say my delorean is tutorial because the front is similar lmao
general 2022-10-26 20:31:03 then they pull out the “oh it’s just modified”
general 2022-10-26 20:31:08 that’s not how it works
general 2022-10-26 20:31:51 try hover engine control surfaces
general 2022-10-26 20:31:56 they’re really fun
general 2022-10-26 20:32:55 <@163143541160148992> your opinions on using self-propulsion hover thrusters to control planes
general 2022-10-26 20:33:53 well what do you use then
general 2022-10-26 20:33:58 i want know
general 2022-10-26 20:34:03 stacked control surfaces?
general 2022-10-26 20:34:15 i see
general 2022-10-26 20:34:27 although being able to do ace combat type shit is funny
general 2022-10-26 20:34:32 aerodynamics be damned
general 2022-10-26 20:34:37 yeah
general 2022-10-26 20:34:47 i’ve only just now realized the potential of hover engines
general 2022-10-26 20:35:10 you can stack them on each other
general 2022-10-26 20:35:18 and make them face a piston or motor
general 2022-10-26 20:35:20 with nothing on it
general 2022-10-26 20:35:22 to self propel
general 2022-10-26 20:35:36 also besides
general 2022-10-26 20:35:40 for that level of heavy lifting
general 2022-10-26 20:35:53 you’re gonna need to use suspension
general 2022-10-26 20:36:22 i love graphic design class
general 2022-10-26 20:37:46 i tried making an eye of cthulhu
general 2022-10-26 20:37:50 and then i look in creations
general 2022-10-26 20:37:59 and someone already made a *big ass* eye of cthulhu
general 2022-10-26 20:38:03 so now mine just looks sad
general 2022-10-26 20:38:41 ok jeffrey
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 03:12:48 magician
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 03:13:04 
general 2022-10-27 03:17:41 i am a fucking wizard
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:00:21 when building the plane itself
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:00:29 instead of using all control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:00:40 use some hover thrusters and pistons facing them
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:01:05 keep the thrusters at whatever throttle you need, and make sure it’s all balanced out
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:01:17 then use the pistons to push towards the thrusters on toggle
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:01:32 and you can generate unbalanced thrust
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:01:45 making it roll, pitch, or yaw way faster
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:13:06 it is a glitch engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:13:12 lemme draw because i can’t get on PC rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:02 blue are hover thrusters, black is piston
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:09 everything is attached
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:22 when the pistons in opposite ends move towards the hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:35 the hover thrusters push those pistons harder than the ones that aren’t extended
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:51 and if you make these forces counteract each other like this
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:18:56 the entire assembly begins to spin
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:10 if the drag is high it slows down when you retract the pistons
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:17 now apply this to all 6 directions
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:28 and you can control your orientation in any way
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:46 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:49 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:52 4 pistons, 4 hovers
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:19:57 one piston per hover
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:00 all lined up
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:07 yeah you can
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:12 but this is easy and more stable
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:17 than a lot of alternatives
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:27 what’s your alternative then
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:20:40 suspension gyro?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:21:18 attach everything together
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:21:35 set the hovers to any speed and max drag
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:21:45 and then bind the pistons to whatever you need
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:21:59 preferably Q and E for one pair and E and Q for the other
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:22:31 then enlighten me, oh wise one
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:22:37 on a superior design
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:22:42 because i kinda need one
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:22:55 this *works* but there’s gotta be a better option
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:23:57 suspension weight gyroscope
good ol thrusters/propellers
stacked control surfaces
mouse controlled hover engine gyro
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:24:01 or conveyors
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:24:08 but those can get wacky
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:24:13 why are you mad
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:25:05 my main issue with conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:25:17 they work really well but occasionally twitch the fuck out
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:25:44 imma have to try that
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:09 rotate it in what regard
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:13 as in just
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:21 attach the motorlock to another motor?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:22 oh
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:39 no it’s the assembly
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:26:54 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:27:02 and i can’t get back in-game for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:27:27 actually wait i can get in-game
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:27:54 nvm roblox mobile crashes
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:28:06 yeah no that’s fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:28:43 so it’s just a half piston attached to a locked motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:28:51 and then some extra motors attached to that to rotate it?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:28:55 wait
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:02 half of a piston clipping into a surface
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:04 ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:15 oh
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:28 oh nevermind i see what you mean
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:46 keep one side locked to the craft, have the other side not
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:29:55 use the part not strictly attached to rotate?
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:30:21 i can imagine it but that is pretty hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:30:51 ehh
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:30:54 yeah please do
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:31:41 that’s what i thought
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:31:58 you’re effectively giving it infinite torque
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:32:12 because the piston has effectively infinite mass
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:32:17 relative to the craft
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:32:31 but it’s still spinning
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:32:51 what i mean is
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:33:01 place 50 ballast beams in a giant block and rotate it anyway
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 17:33:25 hoaaaaa
plane-crazy 2022-10-27 22:28:29 can other players see snow pipes
general 2022-10-28 17:28:36 why are people so obsessed with doing chernobyl RPs in plane crazy
general 2022-10-28 17:28:39 there are better games to do that in
general 2022-10-28 17:29:06 i've seen 3 in the past week
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:16:01 should i try making something stupid
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:16:11 ro-scale thanatos exo mech worm
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:23:15 aight so
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:23:37 102 segments

each segment is 5-6 blocks long and 9-10 wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:23:50 including the head and tail
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:24:05 which are differently sized but still count as segments
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:24:23 making that would be a challenge but i think i could do it
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 06:24:33 i might run out of motors lmao
general 2022-12-05 06:25:15 how would i go about making a 100+ segment worm in plane crazy
general 2022-12-05 06:25:21 with each segment being like
general 2022-12-05 06:25:39 5 blocks long and 8-9 blocks wide
general 2022-12-05 06:26:13 wouldn’t be much laggier than most large tank builds with full tracks
general 2022-12-05 06:26:45 sucks that there’s no legal copy paste in the game
general 2022-12-05 06:26:55 each segment is nearly identical bar the head and tail
general 2022-12-05 06:27:45 wdym
general 2022-12-05 06:28:12 name a build that isn’t a mech worm that requires you to copy and paste the exact same thing over and over again
general 2022-12-05 06:28:21 artemis and apollo, actually
general 2022-12-05 06:28:32 if i want to stick with my plan
general 2022-12-05 06:29:10 wdym those are like
general 2022-12-05 06:29:17 just 7x beam spam
general 2022-12-05 06:29:44 are you trying to make the argument that building being tedious is a good thing?
general 2022-12-05 06:29:54 yeah but it’s still the same deal
general 2022-12-05 06:30:07 the only issue is that making a laggy build would be easier but
general 2022-12-05 06:30:18 those people would’ve made a laggy build anyway
general 2022-12-05 06:30:31 you’re trying to shoot it down though?
general 2022-12-05 06:30:43 wdym adding on, you’re saying it shouldn’t be added
general 2022-12-05 06:31:50 being able to copy a segment of a train or worm or ship hull would vastly speed up the time it takes to actually build something large
general 2022-12-05 06:32:08 also don’t forget
general 2022-12-05 06:32:15 if you want to make something symmetrical
general 2022-12-05 06:32:20 copy one side paste to the other
general 2022-12-05 06:33:11 your argument is invalid because competitive builds would become even more impressive when people can spend more time doing other shit than tedious block spam
general 2022-12-05 06:33:39 i’m not talking about that i mean like
general 2022-12-05 06:33:45 let’s say you have a big truss structure
general 2022-12-05 06:33:47 and you need another
general 2022-12-05 06:33:53 copy it and paste it somewhere else
general 2022-12-05 06:34:06 no need to replicate it block by block again
general 2022-12-05 06:34:34 i’m talking about adding it to the actual game
general 2022-12-05 06:34:48 i’d rather not have to resort to an exploit, paid or not
general 2022-12-05 06:34:59 not like copying someone’s build
general 2022-12-05 06:35:10 that’s the build stealing exploits
general 2022-12-05 06:35:13 something else
general 2022-12-05 06:37:56 how would i make the exo mechs ohio beam lmao
general 2022-12-05 06:38:10 or any laser beam really
general 2022-12-05 06:38:23 one moment
general 2022-12-05 06:39:20 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/406493898341613568/888319075900620800/You_Are_Going_to_Ohio.mp4
general 2022-12-05 06:39:26 the ohio beam
general 2022-12-05 06:39:47 artemis’s main funny attack
general 2022-12-05 06:40:03 that’s a video from an in-dev stream for exo mechs
general 2022-12-05 06:40:10 they made it too fast
general 2022-12-05 06:40:34 they literally named it in game files “OhioBeam” afterward
general 2022-12-05 06:41:36 i have another dumb idea
general 2022-12-05 06:42:09 so, to make a laser beam
general 2022-12-05 06:42:18 just have tons of fully extended ropes and a thruster assembly attached to the end
general 2022-12-05 06:42:28 and some lights for good measure
general 2022-12-05 06:42:43 then it gets pulled out of the build insanely fast
general 2022-12-05 06:43:07 then
general 2022-12-05 06:43:13 any way to make a solid assembly of stuff
general 2022-12-05 06:43:20 that goes nyoom like a laser beam
general 2022-12-05 06:43:23 and extends
general 2022-12-05 06:43:47 i could get away with just
general 2022-12-05 06:43:56 snow emitters
general 2022-12-05 06:44:10 on a wing stabilized thruster
general 2022-12-05 06:44:21 it shoots out and leaves a decently long lasting trail
general 2022-12-05 06:44:43 i don’t give a fuck if it’s already been made
general 2022-12-05 06:44:45 i just need it to work
general 2022-12-05 06:44:55 i’m not trying to invent something new
general 2022-12-05 06:45:23 idk of any ideas better than that
general 2022-12-05 06:45:45 well, if you know all that has already been made
general 2022-12-05 06:45:51 then tell me, oh wise one
general 2022-12-05 06:45:57 what’s the best way to make a laser beam
general 2022-12-05 06:46:06 that you’ve seen
general 2022-12-05 06:46:33 well then good
general 2022-12-05 06:46:42 i’ll get to work tomorrow
general 2022-12-05 06:46:54 snow pipes work because you can set them to have zero deviation
general 2022-12-05 06:47:09 and they’re a flat, bright, somewhat blurry color instead of textured
general 2022-12-05 06:47:46 won’t be a massive issue
general 2022-12-05 06:48:02 in-game the ohio beam is first used on phase change
general 2022-12-05 06:48:11 and that also removes the front of the robot eye thingy
general 2022-12-05 06:48:14 so
general 2022-12-05 06:48:26 i can get two birds stoned
general 2022-12-05 06:48:30 or something
general 2022-12-05 06:49:07 probably the same as a gun except with a ring around it or smth
general 2022-12-05 21:27:05 already made it
general 2022-12-05 21:28:11 
general 2022-12-05 21:28:58 i need a design for something
general 2022-12-05 21:29:11 a 6 way gyroscope that can support decent mass and point where my cursor is
general 2022-12-05 21:29:17 imma make some exo mechs
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 01:06:35 this build gon be fun
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 01:40:30 i love attempting to pixel art in a game that really doesn't support it
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:17:52 yeah but
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:17:54 this is different
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:18:09 also that's some dude who used a program to pixelize an image and then colored it manually block by block
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:18:17 already looking not terrible
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:59:23 not a script
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:59:27 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:59:42 so you tellin me he manually picked those colors
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 02:59:56 instead of having a computer generate them and then picking them from that list
creations-chat 2022-12-06 03:00:23 wip XM-05 thanatos, needs like 25 more segments lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:00:50 how do i always end up making people aggressive asf
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:00:59 but like
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:01:02 computers existed back then
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:01:53 he offline rn

bot-central 2022-12-06 03:03:29 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:03:59 did they yeet the vip servers
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 03:04:01 code is undefined rn
general 2022-12-06 03:23:30 do the two shredders technically make this a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:14:02 i need to figure out how to make a laser beam still
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:14:09 that can fit in a small package
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:14:56 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:15:12 snow pipes emit at the velocity they’re moving
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:15:15 same with smoke
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:15:39 i would try an oscillating design but like
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:16:32 it shoots it behind as well
general 2022-12-06 19:37:33 i need something that can fit inside this that creates a laser beam lookin thing
general 2022-12-06 19:38:21 i tried that
general 2022-12-06 19:38:26 it *nearly* works
general 2022-12-06 19:38:34 but i need a contiguous beam
general 2022-12-06 19:38:42 and preferably something that doesn't fire behind lol
general 2022-12-06 20:05:49 why does that motor2 glitch happen
general 2022-12-06 20:05:56 where the motor loses its own strength upon loading
general 2022-12-06 21:06:31 it can fly at 180 now
general 2022-12-06 21:06:36 better than devourer of gods lmao
general 2022-12-06 21:06:42 that thing needs 20 gravity or under to fly
general 2022-12-06 21:06:52 although it'll get heavier as time goes on
general 2022-12-06 22:28:15 what's the difference between legacy and normal rockets
general 2022-12-06 22:58:57 you gotta love cole
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:01:06 alright new plan
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:01:19 i need a big ass weapon that can fit roughly in this area
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:01:29 preferably something that does an absolutely abhorrent amount of damage and/or looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:27:36 it only requires like a week worth of building and insane knowledge of camera, piston, rotation, and motorlock
bot-central 2022-12-07 00:28:09 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 00:29:30 old VIP server is working still
creations-chat 2022-12-07 01:19:27 it goes out now
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:36:10 aight so thanatos has multiple hardpoints, a drill weapon, and a teleportation device
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:36:20 all that needs to be done is create a decent looking laser
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:42:38 finally have a design that might actually work
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:54:20 counterpoint: it’s really hard to do that when you:
a. don’t know where it is
b. have a hard time spotting it due to clutter
c. damage the rest of the worm so it just ends up separating one segment
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:54:29 also this ain’t a pvp build
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:54:35 it just has weapons for the sake of weapons
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:54:42 why would i use a worm in PvP
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 04:55:17 looks pretty cool though
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:25:41 go buy a blender for 99p you absolute wally
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:07:57 i specialize in fun, goofy builds that aren’t necessarily good quality but they don’t have to be
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:11:13 from what i notice, it’s always the 1.5k block ro-scale ultra mega super-locked vietnam/afghanistan era fighter jets that get all the love, tanks gotta be perfectly accurate and the size of half a plot to be good, etc
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:13:50 you spent so long worrying about if the build is gonna do good in <#384025409945337856> that ye forgot the part where you’re supposed to have fun

it’s why i like to see the inexperienced builders make shit directly from their imagination or their favorite game and try their best on it, as long as there was visible effort and knowledge put into the build (not those “i spent 3 days on making a 50 block plane plz upvote” type builds, those are people who refuse to learn)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:23:20 although that’s no excuse to refuse to use motorlock or smth, all the tools are available to you so you might as well use them

fourzees, the issue with your builds is the scale, your proportions are all wrong, F-14 is decent but you need to cover up the motorlock somehow and repaint it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:26:10 no not like that, your maus turret is super short when it shouldn’t be, for example

also tbh i’m not entirely sure if that F-14 is tutorial or not, i just like giving people the benefit of the doubt
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 15:33:39 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 15:33:56 the PY catina?
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 15:34:27 no
creations-chat 2022-12-07 15:58:29 this is why i hate PCC

people like y’all go out and find every excuse to shit on people without giving any constructive criticism, and then proceed to complain about new players not learning how to build

tbf most of the super stuck up builders here are like 14 and don’t know what being polite is
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:00:35 because the argument isn’t complete, that was more of a statement or an insult than an argument

the actual argument would be that lots of people here have an elitism problem and it drives away inexperienced players

there’s a difference between a dogshit low effort build and a relatively shit build that had effort put into it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:05:02 the fact you gotta shit on everyone else while actively attempting to dissuade me *and* go for the “i played for a long time” brag only further proves my point of people here being toxic elitists

and i do agree, there are lots of people who are shit at building and just never attempt to improve, they’re usually as much an asshat as everyone else

i’m focusing on the people who actually want to try building good
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:07:10 but if someone comes in here asking how to improve their build and they just insult them, that’s on them, not the builder

iamstuk has a reasonable point, and when people are driven away by toxic players because they wanted to get better at building, it only makes the issues worse
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:09:48 i’m saying people need to chill out and stop being elitist, noobmaster is saying that people don’t need criticism because their builds are already shit and won’t get better (they need to improve themselves), iamstuk is somewhere inbetween with their argument of “it’s shit, ask how to improve”

it’s a classic <#504436696021204992> argument lol

and it’s not a “i’m playing 3 sides” argument because those are dumb, i’m just restating what’s already happened/is happening
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:12:24 i mean you aren’t too much better, i’m defending you but you also gotta learn how to actually proportion your builds out properly

part of the process of creation is destruction, remake it from scratch and do it better
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:16:26 i understand that remaking builds is the best way to make them better but i’m tired of the kneejerk “fuck you and fuck your shitty ass build” type reactions from people who really should be beyond it

and honestly his F-14 isn’t even that bad, it’s above average by regular plane crazy standards, it’s just that the PCC standards are super high and that so many people have made insane F-14s that the definitions of good and bad have changed
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:18:29 it’s better to say “it’s shit, do better” than it is to say “it’s shit, fuck off” yeah
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:20:31 you didn’t say it and that’s a good thing, you’re better than a lot of people i see here

if i wanted to quote you specifically on something you never said, i’d just string together a poor insult instead of trying to make an actual comment
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:04 tbh my patience is running out on some people too because i try to give someone real criticism and/or advice for future builds/remaking the same build and then they take it as a personal insult

probably some level of bias as well because the type of person that listens to criticism and actually goes through with it usually isn’t the type of person to need to come here to ask someone for help
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:26:36 you’ve made the mazda that people actually like, now make a tiny shitty ricer miata
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:28:38 can you give a 3 wide pop up headlights, might be possible with enough ingenuity

i’ll try when i get home
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:31:45 trapdoor with a sign with circles on it, 2 motors with texts attached to them in a really weird way possibly, then hide the necessary slope with more trapdoors that don’t open
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:33:47 you could also do the same but with a gun part and make a spy car lol
creations-chat 2022-12-07 16:36:11 right now i’m trying to finish up thanatos, hiding as many different weapons as i can in the little armor plate thingies, it all extends out with pistons or motors
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:05:53 i’ll make a giant flying ace combat logo
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:17:05 if you want a funny plane, make a passenger liner with the entire fuselage as the engine, nose and cockpit flips up to reveal a big ass turbine
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:50:22 how the fuck is this argument still going
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:50:31 it’s moved channels
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:50:41 the thing about shit builds and toxicity earlier
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 22:23:56 thanatos laser

thanos beam
general 2022-12-07 22:24:08 the thanos beam is good enough
general 2022-12-07 22:24:35 PTSD inducing
general 2022-12-07 22:25:02 now all i gotta do is finish up the tail, add some more mechanical bullshit
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:35:12 i wish thanos laser was better but it loses oomph after a bit because of how i made it
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:58:36 a snow pipe and a suspension that just moves a lot
creations-chat 2022-12-08 01:37:25 tbf i didn't design the exo mechs
general 2022-12-08 03:37:33 thing looks crazy in build mode lol
general 2022-12-08 03:37:41 max 14, min 9
general 2022-12-08 03:38:02 if i were to guess
general 2022-12-08 03:38:07 probably 9-10 years old?
general 2022-12-08 03:38:16 maybe 11
general 2022-12-08 03:38:30 all about context
general 2022-12-08 03:38:38 40 year old pretending to be a teenager? no
general 2022-12-08 03:38:47 40 year old in a server full of adults and teens? aight
general 2022-12-08 03:39:22 gotta love how r/drama banned all r/teenagers members and they found a solid 25-30% of members were like 25 years old or older
general 2022-12-08 03:39:31 some of which edging 40
general 2022-12-08 03:39:54 wrong ping?
general 2022-12-08 03:40:00 because tbh i'd get it too
general 2022-12-08 03:40:09 that or if a mig-27 releases
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:01:30 what should i add to thanatos
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:01:33 i need ideas
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:02:06 maybe more various extending weaponry

bot-central 2022-12-09 03:22:22 -servers
creations-chat 2022-12-09 05:33:41 it’s mainly the fact that your planes are so simple and yet proportioned nicely, they feel more real than a lot of the attempts at recreating something
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 05:36:52 how would i make a vessel that can rotate entirely towards the mouse cursor, all 3 degrees of rotational freedom
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 05:38:18 something like a cube or sphere
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 05:38:57 i need a way to make an object that has an absurd amount of mass compared to the craft, while still remaining light
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 05:39:08 like an anchor that can move around
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:03:26 i need some help

trying to make something that can rotate in every direction freely, idk how to do it
like an entire build on a giant gimbal mount or gyroscope
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:05:29 counterpoint: motors can't rotate something vastly heavier or more resistive than what they're mounted on, it either spins both sides nearly equally or spins the wrong side entirely
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:41:50 to be fair i didn't know what that was
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 15:30:41 they’re not gonna change that for a while so
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 15:30:44 audios are shafted
creations-chat 2022-12-09 19:50:54 <@651854384258351154> keep the chassis but rebuild most of the exterior using angle lock to make it look smoother

either way, you did a pretty good job on that octane
plane-crazy 2022-12-09 22:44:28 b r i g h t
general 2022-12-09 23:22:07 give me the technology.

general 2022-12-11 19:03:00 this is an art build

general 2022-12-11 19:36:23 it's able to retract and fold in on itself
general 2022-12-11 19:36:33 now i just need to make another part that can extend out from the center
general 2022-12-11 19:36:36 idk how i'll do that
general 2022-12-11 19:37:27 i can't make that work with the space i have
general 2022-12-11 19:38:38 it's already insanely cramped
general 2022-12-11 19:39:24 there is an incredibly dumb solution
general 2022-12-11 19:40:03 maybe
general 2022-12-11 19:42:20 fuck i need suspension to make the ohio beam work
general 2022-12-11 19:42:23 whatever

plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:10 i'm trying to make an omnidirectional hover chair
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:15 but
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:17 instead of moving it just spins
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:26 the center of mass should be perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:32 the hover engines are pushing off an invisible ring of cameras
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:45 you either know exactly what i'm trying to make
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:17:46 or you have no clue
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:18:10 eh nvm
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:18:14 it's a reference to something specific
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 06:18:20 either way i'm trying to figure out this stupid stuff
creations-chat 2022-12-31 06:19:17 how would i make a hover chair that can move around without it spinning out of control

propellers make it spin out of control, i can't keep it stable
creations-chat 2022-12-31 06:21:36 center of mass should be perfectly centered but it doesn’t behave so
creations-chat 2022-12-31 07:14:48 <:FallWithinMyCalculations:995238399164284988>
creations-chat 2022-12-31 07:19:55 actually i should just attach the chair to thanatos’s head and make it an invisible link
creations-chat 2022-12-31 08:19:56 and don’t forget some dude who prefers to be anonymous who’s doing some crazy shit rn

imagine a PvP build that’s completely impervious to damage, like rockets, cutters, and bullets passing directly through it
creations-chat 2022-12-31 08:21:59 fortunately, nobody has a fucking clue how to actually make something like that work decently, as far as i know it’s pretty much just a one-off glitch that’s really inconsistent
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:07:54 still trying and failing to make a hoverchair that looks decent
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:08:17 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:08:24 both really
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:08:33 just the smallest form factor
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:08:37 that can fly in all 6 directions
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:09:59 it doesn't need roll
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:10:08 or pitch
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:10:18 hm
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:10:29 no bigger than 4x3x3 visually by the end of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-31 18:12:07 tryna make the funny flying gaming chair
creations-chat 2023-01-10 04:34:50 just make a brick move at mach 20, use blunt bow shock plasma dynamics to completely ignore aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 01:45:27 i require aid
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 01:57:28 what does "ignore others" for hover engines really do
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 03:06:31 this is gonna be fun
creations-chat 2023-01-19 03:06:55 working on artemis and apollo again
creations-chat 2023-01-19 03:14:12 currently working on phase chagne
creations-chat 2023-01-19 14:29:02 and usually angle locking is reserved for details on relatively small builds

i forgot if its possible to do in regular servers due to usually requiring delayed motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 16:15:47 it *was* a crutch
general 2023-01-19 21:28:14 ??
general 2023-01-19 21:28:33 making a plane crazy game on your own?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 01:12:04 and so the bullshit continues
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 13:09:06 what's with the obsession of chernobyl RP in this game
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 13:09:20 like
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 13:09:24 there are *actual* games for that
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:10:24 more construction
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:10:36 having to make two of almost the same build is annoying
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:10:50 and then i gotta figure out how to control them independently
creations-chat 2023-01-20 23:37:14 front of the other one is done, i just need to fix up the internals and make the back section
creations-chat 2023-01-20 23:54:50 both deployable weapons work now
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 23:57:52 they transform :)
general 2023-01-21 01:04:19 flying both of these fuckers at once is annoying but the fact it works is surprising
general 2023-01-21 01:23:40 no
general 2023-01-21 01:23:44 both are flown like planes
general 2023-01-21 01:23:51 and the only 2 cutters in the entire build are used for decor
general 2023-01-21 01:23:55 whitename

creations-chat 2023-01-21 03:17:16 thanks, unfortunately people don’t like it
creations-chat 2023-01-21 03:19:20 well now i need to make ares, should be simpler than thanatos and twins but it will be a lot larger
general 2023-01-21 18:04:59 you can politely fuck off
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:06:07 so, i’ve gotten pretty damn good at building without motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:06:15 time to actually learn how to build with motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:07:04 because they’re too complicated for an average 9 year old to build
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:07:12 you actually have to *think* about the design
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:07:17 and how to integrate it
general 2023-01-21 18:07:39 mate, it’s a good response
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:14 wait, legacy option actually does something?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:10:37 ah
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:06 why not use a suspension cannon
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:21 spinning seems like it would be hard to time
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:30 no i mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:11:44 use the suspension to speed the rockets up
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:26 wait a minute
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:40 so spinning the missiles like that means they go faster?
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:12:59 why would that go in a straight line tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:13:15 fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:13:46 i kinda want to make a flak gun though
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:14:11 just shoot one motorlocked tnt projectile and break it apart when it’s close to the thing i’m trying to kill
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:02 if all the motorlock is in one small projectile, i can just set one TNT to blow up with high blast power and self damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:22 then detonate the rest once the motorlock is broken and the rest of the tnt is everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:15:54 i could probably add it to XM-05
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:16:14 or my next project
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:16:36 no that’s just called low grav
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 18:16:46 and using weird push physics
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 21:33:03 gotta love how people like my wip build better than the finished version
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 22:03:20 how do i make motor2 turrets not wobbly
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:10:53 do these builds even work outside of pvp/vip servers
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:11:03 because idk how to angle lock without tnt
general 2023-01-29 07:24:11 POWER
general 2023-01-30 19:18:51 nuclear multimode jet
general 2023-02-01 16:36:03 hoaaa
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:14:28 are trails disabled in pvp mode or is this just the worst server in existence
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:15:29 hm
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:15:36 save/settings buttons don't even load
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:15:39 this is just a terrible server
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:16:05 and the other PVP server is completely empty
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:22:59 if i had a nickel for every time i saw someone with a supermaneuverable russian ground attack jet with legacy rockets and fireworks who never chats and flies around for about 15 minutes, kills one person, and leaves
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:23:17 i'd have at least 50 cents
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 16:23:22 why the fuck is this stereotype so common
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 18:19:26 literally straight out of a child's imagination
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 18:19:29 you love to see it
plane-crazy 2023-02-08 18:19:40 built like a poorly assembled lego set
general 2023-02-21 18:34:29 there are better ways to make pvp builds
general 2023-02-21 18:35:04 there is always the old trick of making it literally too big to fail and use a glitch engine to propel it
general 2023-02-21 18:35:28 yeah you’re under 13
general 2023-02-21 18:35:34 turn back now
general 2023-02-21 18:35:44 the layers of this discord server are not for your kind
general 2023-02-21 18:36:07 you’re getting incredibly defensive
general 2023-02-21 18:36:14 it’s slipping
general 2023-02-21 18:36:32 
general 2023-02-21 18:38:11 defo not a spider

general 2023-02-23 05:06:24 teleport half piston with trails, conveyor drive, tons of ballasts and maybe a cutter for good measure
general 2023-02-23 05:07:03 and shove “JUDGEMENT” on the speakers
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 14:23:23 suspension that just vibrates the smoke thing
general 2023-02-27 14:48:56 my body is ready
general 2023-02-27 16:38:39 one of the drawings of all time

general 2023-03-09 16:33:24 
general 2023-03-20 06:21:01 i’ve had people call my delorean tutorial because the front looks vaguely similar
general 2023-03-20 06:21:36 despite literally everything else
general 2023-03-20 06:21:54 but like
general 2023-03-20 06:22:01 yeah
general 2023-03-20 06:22:17 there’s the people with the black and neon color worms and shredders and whatnot
general 2023-03-20 06:22:22 it can do everything
general 2023-03-20 06:22:25 including time travel
general 2023-03-20 06:22:33 i’ll get the videos again

general 2023-03-20 06:23:43 one moment
general 2023-03-20 06:24:41 that was a crane fly, not a mosquito
general 2023-03-20 06:24:50 still a pest but nowhere near as annoying or dangerous
general 2023-03-20 06:25:04 did it look like this
general 2023-03-20 06:25:18 yeah that’s a crane fly
general 2023-03-20 06:25:34 they do nothing except kill your grass

general 2023-03-20 06:31:09 they hide anywhere
general 2023-03-20 06:31:18 and they can’t even bite humans
general 2023-03-20 06:31:21 they literally just
general 2023-03-20 06:31:25 strangle cockroaches to death
general 2023-03-20 06:31:40 with their big ass pedipalps or whatever they’re called
general 2023-03-20 06:31:45 i’m not sure the equivalent
general 2023-03-20 06:32:00 see, tunnel and funnel spiders are legitimately scary
general 2023-03-20 06:32:11 those are the ones you just stay away from or delete
general 2023-03-20 14:28:39 absolutely not
general 2023-03-20 14:29:10 discuss
general 2023-03-20 14:29:54 nah it’s regular plastic explosive and way too many metal beads
general 2023-03-20 14:30:24 you ever just kill an entire pond full of ducks in one rocket
general 2023-03-20 14:30:30 don’t do this
general 2023-03-20 14:30:41 doesn’t make you look funny or even annoying
general 2023-03-20 14:30:42 more like
general 2023-03-20 14:30:44 disappointing

general 2023-03-28 03:33:15 what am i doing with my life
general 2023-03-28 14:48:02 
general 2023-03-28 14:48:45 average follower of magnus
general 2023-03-28 14:50:01 he’s **dead**
general 2023-03-28 15:22:36 every single time someone starts a gender argument
general 2023-03-28 15:23:04 the main argument on their side is “it’s bad to not identify as the gender you were born as” in usually more insulting terms
general 2023-03-28 15:23:10 but they can never elaborate why
general 2023-03-28 15:23:13 not a single one
general 2023-03-28 15:23:28 other than just “it’s fundamentally bad” for seemingly no reason
general 2023-03-28 15:23:38 probably religious indoctrination or other reasons
general 2023-03-28 15:24:25 given everything about you
general 2023-03-28 15:24:46 i suspect you’re a young teen/tween attempting to incite arguments on the internet for your own personal entertainment
general 2023-03-28 15:24:58 spreading misinformation online, if you will
general 2023-03-28 15:25:14 doing a little trolling
general 2023-03-28 15:25:16 for the inclined
general 2023-03-28 15:25:38 you’re definitely some level of religious
general 2023-03-28 15:25:55 i suspect your parents force you to go to church lmao
general 2023-03-28 15:26:24 the science is also psychological
general 2023-03-28 15:26:30 and philosophical
general 2023-03-28 15:27:30 in the grand and final pursuit of human happiness, gender dysmorphia is a mental illness which can be corrected through gender reassignment
general 2023-03-28 15:27:39 it’s that simple
general 2023-03-28 15:48:27 it’s effectively equal
general 2023-03-28 15:48:48 the only reason why there’s a discrepancy
general 2023-03-28 15:49:03 china has historically killed way too many female babies
general 2023-03-30 04:32:25 this should be kept in the bedroom, good lord
general 2023-03-30 04:32:38 buy Juno, it’s better
general 2023-03-30 04:32:58 why not

creations-chat 2023-05-23 21:18:56 1212 isn’t even that good
creations-chat 2023-05-23 21:26:25 nah average is 500-600, but for regular chess hobbyists 1200 prolly about right
general 2023-06-12 18:01:27 bruh
general 2023-06-20 06:23:02 i want to be a jumping spider
general 2023-06-20 06:23:16 i want to live in a glass box and be tiny and make hammocks and sleep and eat big worms
general 2023-06-20 06:23:30 and occasionally look curiously at things
general 2023-06-20 06:23:57 yeah but pet spiders exist
general 2023-06-20 06:24:19 and exterminators don’t really deal with spider problems, more like termites and roaches and whatnot
general 2023-06-20 06:24:38 pider

general 2023-06-20 06:27:30 i like how stupid tarantulas look and act
general 2023-06-20 06:27:40 like, you can barely see their eyes
general 2023-06-20 06:27:44 their abdomen is big
general 2023-06-20 06:27:48 they crawl really slowly
general 2023-06-20 06:28:03 when they try to dig holes they sometimes end up putting the dirt back into the hole and get really confused
general 2023-06-20 06:28:25 look at this dope ass spider
general 2023-06-20 06:28:33 he’s shiny
general 2023-06-20 06:29:01 looking like a church window

general 2023-06-20 06:35:50 you know, people say that they have trypophobia
general 2023-06-20 06:36:01 and then reference pictures of people’s hands with holes in them
general 2023-06-20 06:36:13 it’s not pictures of holes, it’s the fact that there are holes where holes shouldn’t be
general 2023-06-20 06:36:50 trypophobia
general 2023-06-20 06:37:40 apple

general 2023-06-24 05:55:24 hi
general 2023-06-24 05:56:06 it vaguely resembles an elephant
general 2023-06-24 05:56:19 this was definitely just some form of scheme
general 2023-06-24 05:56:26 embezzlement scheme of some kind
general 2023-06-24 05:56:48 it’s literally just a block of stone that got blasted and polished with water
