plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:23 Tried the swashplate design a minute ago. 

I fucked it up, or it doesn't work anymore.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:30 'Cause the heli won't even get off the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:38 That or my heli is too big.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:29:41 I don't know what it is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:30:19 Uh.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:30:25 The first pinned one that shows up.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:06 I did the Sakura Swashplate.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:07 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:20 I look at the two, and wonder where I went wrong. 'Cause they look the same.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:29 *if* I went wrong.
plane-crazy 2019-07-14 11:31:30 I don't know
the-dump 2019-07-16 10:40:13 
the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:22 Really?
the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:27 Interesting.
the-dump 2019-07-16 11:12:34 First time I ran across.
the-dump 2019-07-16 16:14:13 Ah, but you see.
the-dump 2019-07-16 16:14:17 Sechs, is six in German.
the-dump 2019-07-16 16:15:21 lmfao
the-dump 2019-07-18 12:50:58 What game was that in?
help 2019-07-18 13:35:28 Sawshplate has already been made. But I don't know if it actually works.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:32 Hell I may have done it wrong.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:38 But if you make a swashplate that's innovative.
help 2019-07-18 13:35:43 It's a step in the right direction.
help 2019-07-18 13:36:18 To be frank, I didn't make it. I replicated it to incorporate it into a heli.
help 2019-07-18 13:36:36 It's pinned in the <#384025409945337856> channel as well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:39:25 I agree
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 13:39:44 Although that track looks awesome.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:16 Y'all over here arguing about fixed prop pitch.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:24 Technology has moved on.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:28 Way beyond that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 17:56:40 Put some motors on there, and call it variable pitch. Holy shit.
plane-crazy 2019-07-28 17:07:28 That place is pronounced Nygeer though
