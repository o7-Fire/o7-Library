general 2021-06-24 03:44:55 shit tho he is right melting the ice caps (mars not earth good god) would likely spread water and make growing plants easier. but we'd have to warm the area near the ice caps before so it dosent just instantly re-freeze after melting
general 2021-06-24 03:45:55 elon will go down as the man who took humanity to mars while also being the first person to nuke another planet
general 2021-06-24 03:46:32 i mean mars' magnetic fields have basically died so the radiation from the sun is already more than nukes probably
general 2021-06-24 03:46:47 anyway we'll probably figure it out someday

"Xue hua piao paio bei feng xiao xiao" he sings, for there is nothing else he can do.
