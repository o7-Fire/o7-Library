bug-reports 2021-04-30 16:28:00 Im so confused on why and how the britannic started sinking into the ground...
bug-reports 2021-04-30 18:12:52 So brief description, I joined loaded in my Britannic and someone touched it and it got launched all the way to the other end of the plots, it was some kind of piston glitched car. Whatever it was I have no idea how it was able to easily move my 15k block build. Heres two videos on how glitchy it became when I went near it or even touched it...

creations-chat 2021-04-30 18:45:28 alr, but after that I need help with the sides. The sides are wayy to underdeveloped and I have no ideas!
creations-chat 2021-04-30 18:50:38 Alr I changed the shade of red and it actually looks better!
creations-chat 2021-04-30 18:52:57 Good?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 18:56:48 Bingo
creations-chat 2021-04-30 18:59:27 
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:01:54 Im not sure what to do though
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:08:55 So I tried something different, I made the base gray but I also made the gun white and gray should I keep it like that?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:16:08 They're all the same color just some blocks are different materials
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:18:17 The thing is I already did they are all the same color, just different materials
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:22:48 
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:26:10 
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:30:48 
creations-chat 2021-05-02 14:12:48 Actually maybe I can do that for the front 2 guns
creations-chat 2021-05-02 14:16:17 That's what I was going for just in case if I wanted to use it later for a larger project also <@!720891502108344360>  Good idea but I thought of making a giant ship instead like around 4 - 5 plots long and most likely half a plot wide ish- so it can fit the cannon.
