creations-chat 2023-04-19 12:19:32 can i please get some general feedback on this weird spaceplane thing, ive been told the nose was a bit wack what do yall think
creations-chat 2023-04-19 12:22:22 So you think I should change it gotcha. Got any ideas on what would look better, make it longer, pointier etc? open to any suggestions
creations-chat 2023-04-19 12:32:32 I was thinking of doing something like this but a lot shorter, maybe replacing the 2-3.5 blocks in front of the cockpit with an angle lock but I'm not sure whether its worth trying or not (also thanks for the praise uea)
