plane-crazy 2022-08-07 16:36:47 I tried my best into creating a decent heli that doesnt lift up like a plane and flies using vtol like normal helis do
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 16:37:48 One time my helicopter was like this stoopidly buggy  and flipping and clipping into ground my friend pushed me out of the ground and somehow fixed it after i resummoned it
plane-crazy 2022-08-07 16:38:54 What can i improve on this?

plane-crazy 2022-08-07 16:44:46 So if i wanna make a decently sized but incredibly detailed tank. Should it be like 5 blocks wide? 3 blocks main body 1 block per side skirts

plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:08:07 What do you mean bro? Im also confused
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:08:45 Add motor 2s to different parts of the shark that move, or use unpowered motors for replacement.
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:09:00 God i hate making tank treads
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:10:06 I tried doing the thin tank tread on youtube but turns out it didnt work cuz the wheels would just flatten and leave a VERY big gap between the back wheel and treads
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:10:17 Like the back treads
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:11:17 "items will take up to 24 hours to arrive" its not like its a physical package and instead its a digital package that can arrive in mere minutes
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:11:48 I cant rlly explain it in words. But can i send you a picture of what happens?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:12:20 Or a drawing
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:16:37 Can anyone help? The tank treads were created that they like grip onto the wheel in creation mode but in all scenarios that happens. Very bad drawing ikr
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:17:37 Yba trader with those  dds and that giorno sipping a cup server profile pic

plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:20:15 Also, what's a reasonable size for a good looking tank with lots of detail? Like 5 wide, 10 length?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:20:45 I was a old yba trader
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:21:39 I quit. I had digital sptw but was scammed out of my soul. I got the garlic kc rn but got it from a redeemed lucky arrow which i assume cant be traded.
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:22:03 Old map was a lot of fun
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:22:32 Oh my god thats so true w/o a ps, your screwed
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:23:10 I quit because of my regret to not keeping my digital and being satisfied with it. I just abused myself with regret knowing my digital is gone.
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:23:52 "Report spam never fails its job!"

plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:51:37 What ok?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:52:46 Confused
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:53:22 is there a video proof requirement??
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:56:51 What are you making?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:59:17 Does the ranks need to have a video proof of it rolling and moving?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 15:01:08 Ig imma record it all tmmr
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 17:17:21 I can but tmmr cuz phone no no handle roblox even without recording
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:44:34 Has someone created a moab in plane crazy? I think they do exist
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:45:34 Thrusters or motor 2s exist. Basically hook a motor 2 to a wing panel section and sw
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:45:43 Mother of all bombs
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:46:06 Was it a missile or a bomb? Not sure now
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:48:07 Oh......
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:48:27 Oh yeah i now see the resemblance
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:48:36 You are 100% speaking truth
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:50:43 "simple" looking objects that like can float in space that doesnt lift or sink like one bit take like months to do. Never underestimate what size they are. All it matters is you improve
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:55:02 How will you do tha
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:55:45 Same i just cram stuff together and somehow it looks good
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:58:16 Custom jets?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:58:19 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:59:21 Im literally limited to only using like f-15 for american jets and using the russian jets for main building of jets. Im tryna experiment with making a custom 5 by 10 tank that will be so detailed my brain cant handle
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:59:38 M2m? Mouse to mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:00:23 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:00:30 Glitched mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:00:58 I dont rlly pvp prioritise cuz 99% of my servers is just me alone or a dead server
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:01:12 So i tryna make custom tank with massive details
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:02:57 Confuse confused confusion
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:08:13 Motor 2s but instead of keybinds you use glitch mouse control?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:09:18 That's pretty good cuz i think it would have a lot of sense for more detailed jets to have that style for less keybind maneuvering
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:11:41 Same
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:11:50 Gun shooting too
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:12:35 Have you ever felt the feeling like dancing like you feel like you have a talent for it? Because i got 2 of those goosebumps ngl.

plane-crazy 2022-08-09 13:56:30 Ballast blocks and partner it up with helium blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:01:37 The bottom part of the nose on that looks like a gun to me. Also how many blocks is that?
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:36:25 I cant even barely get to 1000 blocks...
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:37:00 M-1 abrams

plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:51:01 The only part i struggled with cars is the chassis. I hate making them so much :(
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:53:44 Can u help me with something? I have a motorlock sticking out of my tank and i have no way to fix it, and the only way i need to clear it is by building over it. What like little build is good enough for a motorlock on a tank structure. I dont have any pictures of the problem though. But i have a pic with the same tank but i alr drawed where the problem lies.
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:54:19 Wow. What a beauty. The amount of angle lock is beautiful i cant even explain  to myself how it did that
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:54:44 Me too pls
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:55:55 <@809781295500099584> what name of tank is this?
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 14:56:39 I cant. If i do something to the motorlock. Its gonna break everything. Oh wait. I could probably cram another motor 2 turret on it

plane-crazy 2022-08-09 15:17:32 <@401530469952389130> which side of tank should i replace the other with? The right side or the left side?
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 15:17:38 This one is right side
plane-crazy 2022-08-09 15:17:43 This is left

plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:19:36 Idea for defending against ground pvp vehicles such as those cutter vehicles that ram into tanks as a spinning bayblade or a shredder but not those flying ones.
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:20:56 Basically trapdoor cube whatever size fits your tank. Fill it with the TNT balls. Then the trapdoors which face backwards towards the opposing enemy opens and releases the bombs. Then booms. Then supposed kill

plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:19:25 Super THIN canopy
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:21:29 This thing is so cramped i cant find the problem that the turret is bugging out of and making it stick out 1 block. Or i intentionally made it that way and havent realised it cuz im a idiot. Also does it look good? So i need any more color changes to it
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:22:01 Its already good tho- i just am not used to super thin canopies
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:26:23 I didn't do any of ideas and stuff from actual tanks and mashed it up from my brain. Should i try fixing the 1 block part on the front of the turret? That one block sticking out below the turret and make it more smooth and not so rough?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:26:57 Well then soon your gonna make a gyroscope with whatever speed its still gonna stabilise
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:28:41 Well then ur gonna make a entire new physics engine inside of plane crazy with that kind of technology and help from the masterminds xd
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:30:51 Below the turret right? This one?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:32:10 Mk
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:33:07 How the hell do you not expose motorlock with such a tight build like that?!?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:33:33 Its custom but i call it McChicken for now
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:33:45 Cute dog
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:35:58 Im so so impressed on how you did a build with 2 blocks wide. I cant make a build that's within a even length nor width that's also a plane cuz i think its cuz of my ocd if im correct
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:36:30 Wow. Just wow
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:38:12 The main part that intrigues me is the wing part. God that's smooth
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:39:07 Ahhhh ok ok i thought u made a plane thats literally two blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:39:59 Im just impressed on how you did the top part of the wings. And isnt that line on the edge of the wing trails? Seems familiat
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:41:53 No no. The half wedge down or up blocks on the wings. Did u need to do a seperate angle lock for them also?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:45:13 Wdym? Im rlly confused cuz im not too experienced yet i played a long time ago
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:47:07 What's the purpose for the motorlock that angles it upwards? For design? Never seen a plane with a wing design like that other than a-10
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:48:47 Does custom wheel allow the use of non spinning wheels cuz my custom tank doesnt use them, or should i use my other functional tank for getting the rank?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:49:12 The amount of motorlock is insane ._.
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:50:45 Damnit. I wanted to use my detailed tank for getting the rank but im stuck with using the chicken fillet tank ( my other tank is named chicken fillet ) my custom one is named ( McChicken )
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:51:00 Exploded pistons??
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:51:35 This tank is no wheel drive but it sure can drift
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:52:00 You extend and lock the pistons then explode them?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:54:21 All my tanks have the ability to drift for some reason...... Also can u teach me on how to fix up my supension to not bounce as much but works as the suspension duty it needs to do like its pretty stiff but can cross a lot of terrain i guess
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:54:44 Were those the annoying pistons you had to deal with?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:56:28 What's the purpose on those damping settings
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:56:59 I cant find any guide on how to tune my suspensions
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:58:11 Do i need to lower the max length one?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 17:58:22 Cuz its in 5-6 currently

plane-crazy 2022-08-15 18:17:37 That worked
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 18:17:41 Its pretty smooth now
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 18:18:30 It doesnt have that much of a freelength so it compacts and only releases once it touched elevated surface or cool
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 04:30:45 no i like the chunky-ish part on the roof of the wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 04:46:40 hehe

plane-crazy 2022-08-16 07:07:10 Bro could sweep anyone once they launch their build if he adds a motor that can fling i think
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 07:07:26 Did it reach the height limit
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 07:07:44 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 07:08:11 Sure but later cuz the motorlock is way too cramped and i need to make sum adjustments
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 07:08:25 GODDAMN

plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:09:26 i think if your already good at doing like a plane, you should stop making them and try out making like a boat or terrrain you might be good at it like a hidden talent

plane-crazy 2022-08-18 13:59:52 Thank god that way im not gonna use any more accounts
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 14:01:28 They need to add a add slot. But if its default is infinite its gonna be a problem. Like the default setting your gonna see is like unscrollable amounts. The best way is to make the save slots the same but add an option to add slots by urself. And not by default. That way people can manage and decide if they wanna keep adding more slots
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 14:02:23 Real
plane-crazy 2022-08-18 14:02:39 Oh wait my robotic specialist came :>

plane-crazy 2022-08-22 10:19:05 That aint how godzilla is supposed to be 😂 bro'a tail is a fuse
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 10:34:08 Maybe like a 3 block wide 4 block long foot and make the legs connect to the feet by a half wedge
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 10:34:16 Half block wedge
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:40:20 Is that like a motorcycle or a hovering vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:42:25 Bro when u tryna pvp u get a server with people basically testing their mechs and making stuff and if ps servers r broken and u wanna build with tnt enabled. Aint gon happen cuz there u will get 3 tanks, 1 helicopter, 2 planes not even dogfighting and just ramming into each other
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 14:46:40 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:32:09 Spinning radar?
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:33:03 Where violence where
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:33:56 Well im still waiting
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:34:52 Was it even a goddamn square?
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:35:25 80% of the entire plane crazy uses motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:36:16 People could remake something like that but even more advanced and has a decent size wing span for a large cube
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:36:51 How tf does people do that to a F-14? Was it like a big scale and not connected to the f-14?
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:37:44 People who do tutorials and claim its theirs be like:
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:38:31 Me who literally named one of my tanks McChicken
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:39:28 Make the white motor face the other motor
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:57:43 Like the main motor attached to the build. Keep that. But remove the motor near the wing. Then replace it with a substitute of a motorlock just 1 lock. And remove that block connected to the motors and the wing. Replace it with the motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:58:17 His body so long
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:59:16 Imma just circle the parts you need to know
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 15:59:29 2/3 the plot. ....
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:01:18 <@670722393517457409> blue part is where will you replace the motor 2 with. Orange part is the motor 2 your gonna switch with 1 motor locked
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:03:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:04:19 Speed is the one who controls it
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:06:10 Try it
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:10:11 That's what i was about to say ._.
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:13:30 Cheese graters
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 16:13:49 Moonwalk like Michael jackson
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:10:29 <@750712383227428945> does it walk normally and not moonwalk now?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:22:43 Ngl when im too bored to make a ladder for my tall motorlock builds- i just do parkour to get up top and down ._.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:36:40 Does it have multi stages? And how do u make it up vertically straight upwards
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:39:03 Damn
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:39:20 How many blocks was the fold from until it reached height limit?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:40:24 My builds aint even halfway through the hieght limit ._.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:40:31 Food segment?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 00:41:40 e
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:11:59 Rust blocks even though its L and color palletes
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:13:16 Wut?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:13:37 Green colored glass added with lights?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:14:28 On the rotors that are spinning the blades. At the very block that connects both the blades/rotors to the main body. Replace it with a no powered motor
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:15:50 Imagine there was a sunset and sunrise view
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:23:40 Yed
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:26:48 Re size tool gonna be so used
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:27:21 You can just reverted it if you accidentally save it. But u cant revert after u left that server
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:27:55 I cannot wait to see my builds look trash and remake all my goddamn helicopters ( pain )
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:28:06 e
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:29:44 But the pcc whips out their brain knowledge and makes builds that i think you cant create  in rbloxstudio
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 08:43:41 Unless the builder is doing a troll build. There's no way he could get banned for just building a bad one
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 09:42:18 lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 09:44:09 yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 09:44:12 infinite save slots
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 10:12:32 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 10:14:19 mystery
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 10:20:11 instead of moonwalk, he's now frozone?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 10:31:37 yes frozone
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:48:34 e
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:48:58 Big brain yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:49:12 90% public servers are noobs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:50:29 I literally run over a boat while my tank was in the water. And i fling jets on the ground also. God 2-3 people are noobs. Atleast 1 is decent
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:51:28 Mario but indian
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:52:16 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:53:19 Pvp servers just have people building, and shredders. Most of the time those public pvpers just dont even hit each other with rockets.
They just circle around each other and dont even try to use their weaponry
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:54:04 I have a anti-shredder shredder ball. People keep attacking me when im clearly defending them against shredders smh
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 13:55:00 I dont attack people who killing me while im shredder. I go back to build mode and launch my helicopter. Then brrr.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:26:38 Derpy mf 💀
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:26:55 Lag, fps. Internet
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:27:08 It just looks like a missile
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:29:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:30:53 Bad internet causes lag. Which lowers your fps by a lot. Which gives out bad bad fps and causing performance issues on your plane's performance
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:32:32 How large is your jet?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:33:35 What engine do you use?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:33:41 Manually save it
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:33:49 Just manually save it
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:33:54 It doesnt even take a long time
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:34:18 Then always save
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:35:08 The vertical wings are too small and too wide in my opinion.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:35:34 Your on mobile that explains a lot
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:36:09 I have bad memory so i call them whatever i want but thx for making me remember it lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:36:40 Why is there just figures in the background
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:37:53 Literally better than mine. Compare that to this. Although the background on mine is kinda good. But not the build is good on mine
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:38:11 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 17:49:11 Chat died
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:03:55 Partial removal?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:04:08 100% true
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:04:26 Is it gonna fly like one of those submarines
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:06:19 Another legion of shredders.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:08:09 Anti-Warships aint gon be hard after that one
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:09:11 Only way to defeat one of those ships is by killing the pilot of the boat
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:09:58 Just dont attack those peaceful ones who cant afford or use a ps and instead suffer in public pvp for tnt locking
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:10:07 Helicopters ig
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:10:37 I like running over the very first tutorial plane with my tank

plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:12:05 The jet for the airdrop

plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:15:46 You think u can fit this in?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:16:10 5x15 space
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:16:16 5 wide 5 long
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:16:42 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:19:24 Bro fell asleep mid landing 💀
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:19:35 Scatter bombs?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:20:29 Should i create a dassault mirage 2000 for my pvp plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:20:45 Cuz idk how to handle conveyor locked jets for flight
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:21:07 How do you make a scatter bomb like disconnect from each other?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:22:39 Ohh

general 2022-08-23 18:35:29 What?
general 2022-08-23 18:35:47 A McChicken or a Whopper
general 2022-08-23 18:36:24 I have bad grammar and smol brain and sometimes i dont really think that was i was gonna say but i said it anyways
general 2022-08-23 18:36:35 Ahhh ok ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:39:18 Glitched mouse sometimes doesnt like turning or elevating that often
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:39:46 So u gotta resort to a propeller based jet. Or just a control panel being keybinded
general 2022-08-23 18:40:08 Streamable is the option for that problem
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:40:22 Just add propellers
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:40:31 No ugly exhaust.
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:41:12 Why dont you use wasd controls
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:41:55 Unless u wanna see a 2 block thick jet that is places vertically spitting out exhaust
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:42:19 Can we just agree that the bug of the weird noises is just pure annoying
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:42:50 Motorlock wing panels?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:43:08 Welll he alr picked 2 so im going with img 2
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:43:41 Who really was the first one to create it?
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:43:56 Who created all those builds on the thumbnails
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:44:31 Its better than the tutorial plane that's for sure
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:44:51 Probably
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:46:36 That's why i run over those noobs
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:46:43 Their planes r so bright
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:49:25 Bro the sky campers who run away when its a dogfight and camp when its a ground fight is so annoying. The only way you can deal with them is with a drift tank
general 2022-08-23 18:50:16 My tryphophobia is triggering from that tower
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:51:14 Gta6 comes out after cyberpunk and battlefield's bugs are removed
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:51:32 Most of my tanks can drift
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:52:00 I heard chess will get a update or a new rework or game after mc 2 comes out
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:52:21 I dont think so. The only ones giving up are the computers
general 2022-08-23 18:52:29 Pls no
general 2022-08-23 18:54:21 .....
general 2022-08-23 18:54:27 I wanna die
general 2022-08-23 18:54:46 That doesnt trigger my tryphophobia
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 18:55:51 Cutters still work against blacklisting. If you blacklisted them and ur out of build mode. They can noclip through your build and kill you
general 2022-08-23 18:56:51 Doesnt scare me for some reason. Maybe bcs i cant find them due to my arm hairs which is very thick
general 2022-08-23 18:57:41 Hondy

general 2022-08-23 19:00:22 Its just crinkled not like punch in holes
general 2022-08-23 19:00:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:01:02 Uhhuh
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:05:10 So u dont actually create the builds. U just edit them to the preference you want. Huh
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:05:26 Ig ur rlly a pvp-only player
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:05:38 And doesnt build high quality builds
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 19:06:54 Imma make this spaceship for PvP
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:46:50 Tho people can redeem irl money by robux
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:47:58 Mmmmmm i forgot what game it was. Was it battleships?
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:48:36 Best way is create your own game off roblox ig.
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 08:48:45 And release it to steam or epic games
plane-crazy 2022-08-24 09:17:13 Mama mia....
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 07:45:37 The weight of the plane. Displaced mass ( i like to call weird things that sometimes ) but yeah. Add helium, LIKE a lot of helium
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 16:52:48 Wha- underwater???
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 16:53:54 Does that rlly work underwater?
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 16:54:36 The first ones to ever use motorlock is quite hard to find. But now 90% of pcc uses it
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:05:00 banana
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:05:38 The only modern jet i havent made is F-22. Idm why but i couldnt just make the perfect wings god
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:06:42 <@664538133114912783> is your motorlock tower facing the left side?
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:08:12 Give me a top view of the entire build
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:09:33 Are all those unused control panels unpowered?
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:09:45 Try double checking them
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:11:06 Hmm. Maybe because those control panels facing sideways
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:11:54 If you turn off set control automatically, you command to the system "hey, i dont want to use this control panel, don't make it interact and move with my mouse"
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:13:31 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:14:30 Then just assign the motor 2 if that seperated control panel that's isolated from the main wing panel even has a motor 2 for A,D controls
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 17:15:12 Test it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:24:16 Heat seeking missiles go brr
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 14:25:03 Destiny gundam got flattened by a pan 💀

plane-crazy 2022-08-29 23:44:54 Uss missouri
general 2022-08-29 23:46:24 What happened to that big motorlock build that the tower is the mcdonalds logo? How well does it fly?

plane-crazy 2022-08-30 00:14:22 Or just be lazy and add propellers for drifting
general 2022-08-30 01:48:02 "Eh? You were gone for 2 weeks, you didn't even give me presents when you came back? Now your asking for cuddles and hugs?"
general 2022-08-30 15:36:14 R those fabric wheels?

general 2022-08-30 15:36:33 Ah ok
general 2022-08-30 15:37:08 I never use fabric wheels cuz i feel like they create too much drag for me and doesnt let any of my tanks drift :(
general 2022-08-30 15:37:52 I hope that flies far
general 2022-08-30 15:38:09 Does that.... Mcdonalds sign motorlock tower?

general 2022-08-30 15:56:49 What happened to those
general 2022-08-30 15:59:26 The amount of helium 💀
general 2022-08-30 16:00:14 I wanna see the full body of that ship/submarine
general 2022-08-30 16:01:48 Have yall started pc by doing tutorials also?
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 16:03:45 Ordinary motor on lock or without lock mode.
Either way they angle the motor.
Then above that ordinary motor, add a motor 2. The motor 2 makes it walk. Without needing to reposition it again after every turn and walk.
general 2022-08-30 16:04:05 Same
general 2022-08-30 16:04:30 TheMadvulpen? Or that indonesian guy who steal builds

general 2022-09-05 00:07:02 Yes, what you see is indeed reality. Your ability indeed sees the actions that we will actually perform. However, you will never arrive at the reality that will occur. None who stand before me shall ever do so. No matter what abilities they may wield! This is Gold Experience Requiem!

general 2022-09-05 00:24:53 Ur family and ghost friends "who stole the chicken again???"
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:26:07 What I said is true. I didnt knew or forgot mac ran a pc. I only knew laptops

general 2022-09-05 00:32:43 War thunder
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:45:55 Rickje or the devs make a build that just is the same blocks used in the actual game. Like a build someone created being imbedded into the game code and being pvpers favorite enemy
general 2022-09-05 00:47:53 Technically true? Cuz sp * * * is located in the balls and that's now humans r created so that's the civilization sp * * *  humans where they live in
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:48:18 Its just a turret that
general 2022-09-05 00:48:44 The one who made that pumpkin is cool

general 2022-09-05 00:49:08 What's that supposed to mean
general 2022-09-05 00:49:35 ok thanks for the insults and the "warns"
general 2022-09-05 00:50:10 My favorite way to kill a awkward and weird conversation
general 2022-09-05 00:50:14 Ok
general 2022-09-05 00:50:39 I got no one to have intense hugging :( me lonely
general 2022-09-05 00:51:16 I got 13 c-10 globemasters and galaxies nose diving on those mi-8s
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:52:24 No. A alr spawned in turret which design is made by a player in this server and is made as a default turret on the map. Like they spawn randomnly in pvp mode ( obviously ) and try to kill you
general 2022-09-05 00:54:35 I have 51 Antov 225s coming to hug you and not crash into you and instead landing near your nearest airport and full of passengers waiting to hug you ( softly )
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:54:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:54:58 But the enemies are designed by a white name
general 2022-09-05 00:55:14 I have real life lag machine

general 2022-09-05 00:56:41 Lol
general 2022-09-05 00:56:54 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:57:03 Ikr
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:57:16 Bro when i wanna try pvp no one gets on its such a peaceful server
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:57:31 But if ps servers are down. Pvp servers are always full
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:58:28 But for public pvp servers its randomnly generated difficulty. 0.000001% is for super goddamn hard difficulty which will k**** you instantly
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:59:20 Let's give the noobs a fighting chance and make them create their best turret in a competition to be made for pc2 and in the codes and files
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:59:39 It could be good or embarrasement for them
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 00:59:41 Tbh
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:00:20 Or just let a professional builder; <@883063424614006878> make them or create another competition but for pros to make one
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:01:22 What if they grab 5 players each on 2 sides; 5 professionals and 5 noobs to make their best turret ever created. And in the game codes, 1/10 chance ofc a randomnly chosen turret will spawn
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:02:03 Pro players: hmmmm it needs 17 railguns and 25 towers of motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:04:22 What if they make a code so it randomnly selects a turret design made by noobs. And have the pro players recreate or upgrade it to their knowledge then that same exact code will be used but instead have it generate a turret design and implement it into a random place smthn turrets will spawn at
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:05:13 Does the flaps work?
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:05:34 A-
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:07:07 No mods host a competition where the best 5 builds made by noobs are selected. Then those 5 noob's builds will get selected onto a pro player with like expert supreme players then redesign and upgrade it then ai picks random turret
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:08:59 But for ps. Hm maybe add like a copy paste menu on the menu screen that the host can see and select what turret he should use. And the players can like suggest one of their turret builds to the host of the ps and it will pop-up like "( Name ) wants to use their turret design" and accept and decline bla bla bla
plane-crazy 2022-09-05 01:09:29 Imagine in 5 years people make railguns 💀

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:08 How do i make my fake rotor heli just pull up faster?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:12 Cuz rn it just crap
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:43 No like doing stunts
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:59 Its turning is already good and its speed is decent
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:06 The motorlock is alr cramped af
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:29 Wut??
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:35 Those small proppelers?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:43 I already have too much on the back of my heli just to stabilise it Lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:58 What?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:22 I got the same opinion on the breaking bad ones smh
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:49:56 The haram one was not so bad and the guy falling onto the sanded ground wasnt too bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:51:58 That is true
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:52:09 Cuz ya know it will take a lot of their time creating it tho.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:13 The one that triggers the entire pc community thats decent enough to create a build of their own is noobs going to a goddamn boeing 747 plane thats so high quality it can crash my pc to "pls tutorial"
And once the tutorial got created

"I created this all by myself, it was too easy"
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:18 Everyone gets triggered
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:23 And i mean everyone
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:55:32 I meant the high quality build with motorlock. Jesus christ it would take atleast 24 hours and 178 iq for a noob to create something like TheMadvulpen's su-57
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:57:06 I didnt even put that much of a effort for this all i wanted is to someone to please pvp with me and just have fun. Well my wish got granted from <@835049715451691019>.

plane-crazy 2022-09-07 13:14:55 Tho his megalodon mech thing was massive
plane-crazy 2022-09-07 13:33:48 The amount of thrusters and creativity Tank fish had was insane also his rather unique tranforming mecha-plane with a unique landing gear is quite cool tbh
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 04:50:46 What is it anyways tho?

plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:43:03 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:45:11 Zaku?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:46:44 Should i try making this? Also where do you start doing a mech? Legs? Head? Chest?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:48:26 From the rear view! The shoulder armor and the rear view of the head just looked like a zaku
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:48:46 Ohhh ok. But should i try making the fenrir?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:49:26 Ok ok i am very undescisive and tend to fail choosing options
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:49:35 Oh okay
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:49:53 Lelouch?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:50:35 Like his entire body or does he have a mech
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:50:52 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:51:13 I was wondering if he had a mech you were gonna build so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:52:14 <@581500505759416340> should i do anglelocking for the shape of the body or nah
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:52:24 What?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:53:36 Uh?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:53:38 What?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:54:10 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 14:54:55 Wtf
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:01:44 Triangle wedge and those 1x1 sections on the wedges 2 thing?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:02:37 <@581500505759416340> how did you make that transition between the middle core of the chest piece and the sides of the chest?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:05:09 <@581500505759416340>
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:06:26 <@706717603258957864> can u gimme a background explanation on what is happening?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:08:51 Lol 

<@918581321004089364> what was your way of hiding that motorlock gap?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:13:17 What? What was the correlation between the propellers and the argument?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:17:16 No he isnt talking about his plane, he is talking about the way to cover your motorlock. A little exposing of a motorlock can have significant amount of opinions  and judgement on your build.
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:18:13 No. The part that transitions from the middile part into the intakes. Did you use motorlock to hold them together?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:18:26 Maid skirt?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:21:11 Tbh i rather not hide it cuz like i very impatient and wanna test try it as soon as possible and really just wanna feel the enjoyment of finishing a project and not worrying about intense details such as the exposed motorlock, like this exposed motorlock abomination. But now that i think about it. I hid most of the motorlock on the outer shell of the tank. Hm
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:23:18 It could be silent nerf/buff.

If you think about it hard enough,
PvP jets with the most balanced uncontrollable lift from the amounts of builds placed that were created a long time ago before a specific date before those nerf/buff will slightly lift uncontrollably even more.

While for buffs, that slight lift may make after-silent update planes perfectly balanced.
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:24:36 Ohhhh ok ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:24:58 That makes so much more sense now tbh
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:25:28 Can you show what it looks like?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:27:52 Im not gonna have fun doing a big mech for the first time
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:28:10 <@581500505759416340> will you make that mech a walking mech or a flying mech
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:36:25 195 - 195 - 195

plane-crazy 2022-09-08 15:41:32 Ok ok
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:48:08 Tbh the pc discord isnt the place to argue. Twitter is the place to argue. Or should i say is the argument all along
general 2022-09-08 15:50:42 I have a question; isn't cats and dogs not allowed to have tea? Or just like warm water?
general 2022-09-08 15:51:24 There fixed
general 2022-09-08 15:53:39 Everyone probably hates tutorial builds nowadays since they are so repetitive seeing them in every server. Just like how we see noobs, easy to bully and very low quality but so much quantity being produced. Or pc discord hates them cuz maybe someone just posts a tutorial build and claims its theirs ( certain thailand guy ), aka plagarism.
Or they MAYBE just post a random ass tutorial build from themadvulpen and post it into <#384025409945337856> .
general 2022-09-08 15:54:03 Are Dogs+cats not allowed to have tea or warm water
general 2022-09-08 15:54:48 Jesus christ your hallucinations and vibe is totally off the charts of the sane category

plane-crazy 2022-09-12 03:18:35 Then a random buff God that has the name of armstrong and is a senator that says "Mother of all omelettes jack, dont fret over every egg" comes rushing in with his theme and talks with them more seriously about politics
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 03:21:46 Then a random kid tries punching him
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 03:24:29 Then says "Nanomachines son, they harden in response to physical trauma

general 2022-09-13 05:27:10 Damn
general 2022-09-13 05:29:40 I saw on news that a florida man was naked, and had barbed wires on his pp lol
general 2022-09-13 05:31:07 That's reasonable. Almost anyone who has a dog probably wants their dog to live long because of their bond with each other tbh
general 2022-09-13 05:32:09 Same
general 2022-09-13 05:32:49 What's on the news today about the florida man?
general 2022-09-13 05:33:59 People named jake are a-holes

general 2022-09-13 05:36:36 Ok
general 2022-09-13 05:37:06 Atleast elon musk's son is not the girl who literally has a gibberish paragraph as a name
general 2022-09-13 05:37:39 How about the wholesome kids or funny ones
general 2022-09-13 05:38:16 People named bryan probably are the annoying ones tbh
general 2022-09-13 05:38:50 Normal kid
general 2022-09-13 05:41:40 Jason and bryan are the bullies
general 2022-09-13 05:42:19 Funny ones
general 2022-09-13 05:42:51 Art kid
general 2022-09-13 05:43:43 Truly one of the planes created

It has been made with pure person and made as a plane

plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:00:13 Toggle-able hover drives/conveyor drives are absolute beasts
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:00:25 Pls tell me its a anti-shredder shredder ball
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:00:45 Ok thank god
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:01:51 Also use it against shredders and PROTECT THE INNOCENT please
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:03:20 Am also part of the anti shredder shredder ball group and i just bully shredders to the point they stop targeting the noobs ( who has no ps and just wants to use tnt piston locking techniques ) and rage quit

plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:04:16 Bro 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:06:43 No i meant why u gotta ping mods why so it so unreasonable if no good explanation
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:08:09 That's normal. People just swear at you for no reason as for like a greetings ( in my experience ) but if they continue the slurs then they just absolutely wants to start a fight and swear at you for idk reason. Awkward option i use; "Thanks for the insults"
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:08:16 And likely kill the server
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:09:32 If the first thing they say is "fuck you" my reply is sometimes "ok?" Or just "ok"
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:21:53 Yes but if i am tired of like tryna aim and just wanna have fun protecting innocent people i just use shredder balls
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:22:54 I need to make a forward swept custom jet that can fly very very fast but is also toggle-able for ez aim
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 13:22:59 Same.

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:16:11 Uhhhhh why people like talking about you?
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:16:32 Ahhh fling machines
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:18:02 Pug probably just wants your attention span. What swear word that "you said"
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:18:49 Pug is weird but i like him he funny
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:19:17 👍
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:20:22 Every tank is cool ( but not the blocky ones made by noobs i like ramming them them into the void )
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:21:42 Ouh
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 00:21:51 Big brain move

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:06:12 My class got confused on when i said rotor on a question about how helicopters fly ( on physics class ).... Ig its because of me liking planes and helicopters or plane crazy....
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:08:05 I gained the mood to make a transforming car mech with no head and only the car body, the legs and arms only. But it just gotta drive and drift also.. from that comment lol

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:17:32 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:17:48 Implement the design with the middle engine
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:18:05 So it can middle finger its enemies that are tailing him
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:18:49 <@619312093962829849> can you make the plane's middle engine middle finger
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:19:11 Oh :(

plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:21:20 Well that text took forever to send
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:22:42 Welp, the memes are true? Cuz they said the boss when you fight him has like 7 quadrillion hp 3 stages 170000 weapons he can just barrage but once you play him. He has 10000 hp, 1 stages, 2 weapons....
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:22:57 Not the microwave :(
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:24:09 Just get a toggleable extra hover drive engine that's like 7 hovers with max speed so it can go superspeed to "dodge" the missiles
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:25:09 Should i make my custom plane 1 wide or the standard half block on the sides, and 1 block wide in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 03:25:29 Super jump boost 💀

general 2022-09-16 09:57:59 Jukelele
general 2022-09-16 09:58:35 Short answer: oil

general 2022-09-16 10:00:20 Ahh those monkeys should have left us -👴
general 2022-09-16 10:00:56 Free guns! But the real freedom is eliminating all karens in existence
general 2022-09-16 10:01:30 20% of oogway's comments are like that tbh
general 2022-09-16 10:02:08 Woohoo! Mass school shooting cool!!
general 2022-09-16 14:10:48 Bro havent heard of helium/ballast/balancing your plane's weight 💀

plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:21:27 Well plane crazy channel is quite lively today and is atleast roughly the same speed or more than <#497142796961054721> chat
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:21:55 Fr
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:22:21 What was the original line they r arguing about?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:24:16 I dont really know the line, so i guess it's about the mods being not online for often?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:25:06 I passed that tbh and didnt realise it
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 16:25:49 D o g
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:17:28 Are all the shields just- on the back?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:18:24 I could imagine "watch your six" now is a shortcut to watch your six shields on your six
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:19:08 Rotating shields that can rotate to the front of the mech
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:24:33 Samurais have those waist armors but sundowner made it like a spider and wrapped it around the side of his body
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:26:29 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:27:08 But lost to a teen with a screeching voice with a chin mask
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:27:36 Shield that launches and flings le enemy
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:30:25 Watch tutorials, do not copy them whole, but copy parts you think will benefit the build ( ex nose design, wing design, ), then use 3d models, summon your brain cells, then start designin
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:31:12 Missile on the back of the mech that launches and is a m2m
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:31:40 Oh, i never knew you were creating it for underwater
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:34:01 Or just add a cutter with 3 arms, the middle is untouched and doesnt move, the 2 outer arms are horizontally faced so they both face are on the same angle ) normal build mode, but after you launch angle it with motors so its claw
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:34:32 Bro actually pinged the real madattak 💀
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:34:50 no.
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:35:04 Plagiarism will increase by a lot from noobs.
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:36:44 Bro if that exists, plagiarism by noobs will increase drastically.

Bro would brag that a deathstar with like 30K blocks  is his, but he cant even make a tutorial plane without messing up and giving up or even use a basic technique like a single damn motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:39:25 Pogchamp
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:39:44 I realised this meme is very old damn
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:42:25 He's referring to, "its OUR build"
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:48:37 Does it fold
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:48:55 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:49:37 Imma make it into my list im never gonna complete
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 17:55:54 How'd you place that motor on the wing? The main wing ofc not the tail wings or stabilators.
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 18:01:16 So the thin part of the motorlock is facing the bottom part of the trails, therefore having the ability to move the wing with it
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 18:05:34 So im better off with a no anglelock x02?
general 2022-09-18 18:14:14 Bro is so organized he doesnt save by up and down left to right buy up left to right down left to right
general 2022-09-18 18:14:48 If my grammar cant be understood, its a dead giveaway my sleep is coming
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 18:15:32 Agree

plane-crazy 2022-09-18 18:18:54 Make it drift
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 18:20:14 Railgun ( obviously a joke if you take it seriously oh god )
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 07:35:48 I wonder how fast that thing would be at max speed and fully completed with a high end pc lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 07:37:17 Sooooo u want rickje to make like a system/block where its a magnet and attaches on ur arm when you launch and then have a large plot with shrinking abilities connected to the magnet block thing

plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:08:58 Where tf is the exposed motorlock??
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 14:10:07 .... Its on the bottom anyways, so i feel like people wont care about it too much
plane-crazy 2022-09-29 03:42:58 Bro made a kite
