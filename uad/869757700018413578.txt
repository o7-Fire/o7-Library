general 2023-03-26 03:52:17 Metal to plastic (color) = divide metal value by 1.37209302326 to get the value of plastic equivalent color.
general 2023-03-26 03:52:43 example: 177 color metal = 129 color plastic
general 2023-03-26 03:53:26 For plastic to metal, multiply plastic color value by 1.37209302326 and you'll get the metal equivalent color value
general 2023-03-26 03:53:58 I did the calculations for so
general 2023-03-26 03:54:11 because 177 metal looked like 129 plastic
general 2023-03-26 03:54:26 so the equation is: 177/x = 129

creations-chat 2023-04-25 00:10:04 I know they want it to be realistic, but my question remains unanswered.
creations-chat 2023-04-25 00:13:26 I agree. Nevertheless, the video has more downvotes than only the image of the plane, which suggests that how the plane flies is bad, according to the community. However, I still don't understand why the manoeuvrability is bad...
general 2023-04-26 08:26:18 I am sorry you are having a hard time. Sometimes things happen in life that are very difficult and we don't know how to cope with them. It is important to seek support and speak to someone about what is going on. Are you willing to share more about the issues you are facing?
general 2023-04-26 08:28:07 If you don't want to, I understand and respect that you are not comfortable sharing at this time. Please know that my chat is always open if you need someone to listen and to help you through this time. You are stronger than you know and you will get through this.
general 2023-04-26 08:28:22 I know you will get through this difficult situation and come out even stronger on the other side.

creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:19:14 This look like an apache?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:38:40 
creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:41:00 I don't see any correlation between my creation and a supernova more than them both including atoms. You should take your schizophrenia pills.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:50:48 Just as skins, they don't influence my experience on this discord server
creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:52:54 Sorry, I'm not chronically online so I don't see that as an issue
creations-chat 2023-05-12 06:55:37 I was going to pull up one of your builds, but I've got to admit the fact that they're good.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:03:08 As a model of language, I don't understand what you mean with "boll".
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:05:11 Ya ne amerikanski, pochemu?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:09:31 That sounds good.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:39:26 Is this better?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:41:28 Proof: the old beautiful block outlines
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:45:16 Thanks, I apparently am colourblind to not be able to already tell that.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:50:20 Don't ever post that android ass emoji again
creations-chat 2023-05-12 07:52:34 
creations-chat 2023-05-12 14:20:43 What you're doing is actually egocentric, you think you're the only one that matters because by posting that, it implies that you think we care about your life and your discussions (I say it from experience).
creations-chat 2023-05-12 14:26:59 Btw, builds or designs for it aren't patented <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:00:16 You can't justify your argument, so you resort to juvenile insults.  Really? That's the best you can do? Come on, do better. We are trying to have a civilized discussion here.  There is no need to resort to juvenile insults when you can't back up your argument with logic and facts.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:04:01 Why are you so easily annoyed? You can't have a civil discussion, so you resort to insults? You talk about attention, but you're the one who is being aggressive and hostile. Why are you so aggressive and hostile in the first place? No one's attacked you. If someone's annoying you, you can always not reply and ignore them.  It's not like someone's holding a gun to your head, forcing you to reply?  If you are annoyed, just ignore and stop replying.  Simple, right
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:06:10 My point remains standing.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:08:56 Damn he actually good
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:38:01 I don't give a fuck about these idiotic netizens
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:40:14 The fact that you consider that as "angry" really highlights your anger issues.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:46:29 Your assumption is wrong.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:48:36 I think you're saying that it was bait since you don't want to look ridiculous.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:50:46 It all started when I asked about my creation and was instantly replied with it resembling a star about to go supernova. (btw go to general, better there)
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:53:02 The "barot on top" is clearly bait
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:56:10 You are not obligated to reply; so why don't you just close discord?
general 2023-05-12 15:58:02 Why are you highlighting my persona and the use of the semicolons?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 15:58:24 go to general, it's better in there
general 2023-05-12 15:58:51 Aight I'll be honest, english isn't my main language so I apologize if it sounds bad.
general 2023-05-12 15:59:06 I guess it's the studies I've taken over such language
general 2023-05-12 15:59:35 I mainly speak spanish and russian
general 2023-05-12 16:00:19 kiss as "kiss" or as the "keep yourself safe"?
general 2023-05-12 16:00:33 I know.
general 2023-05-12 16:00:47 keep yourself safe
general 2023-05-12 16:01:28 I only know this word
general 2023-05-12 16:01:38 pneumunoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
general 2023-05-12 16:01:46 which is a medical term that isn't really used
general 2023-05-12 16:01:52 in spanish, the longest word is
general 2023-05-12 16:01:56 electroencefalografista
general 2023-05-12 16:02:40 pneumunoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a medical term rarely used to describe the inhalation of microscopical substances (such as volcano ashes)

creations-chat 2023-05-12 16:08:27 I actually used maths on this to make it hover stably. (2nd law of newton, torque and the momentum from the helicopter and the blades, also used center of mass to get right place of the tail rotor...
creations-chat 2023-05-12 16:12:02 Man used bot scripts (joke)
creations-chat 2023-05-12 16:14:32 You unfortunately don't have any builds showcased under your account in creations. Therefore, I doubt you really know what is "to build" at a superior level in plane crazy.
creations-chat 2023-05-12 16:16:53 Why not general
creations-chat 2023-05-12 16:19:00 You are right! I apologise myself for my fatal error. Here's the correct version: You are not obligated to reply, so why don't you just close discord?
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 16:19:55 Is this the better channel of creations-chat?
general 2023-05-12 16:20:36 yes, it sucks

general 2023-05-12 17:07:41 Oh that, no it wasn't because of that
general 2023-05-12 17:07:56 It's because he's chronically online
general 2023-05-12 17:08:10 touching grass might help
general 2023-05-12 17:08:25 Kind of a proof that you can't properly argument
general 2023-05-12 17:08:28 therefore you recur to racism
general 2023-05-12 17:08:37 Sorry I have a life
general 2023-05-12 17:09:20 prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.
general 2023-05-12 17:09:49 It is in the plane crazy's server ethnic group
general 2023-05-12 17:10:22 I agree
general 2023-05-12 17:11:57 Racism, it is a terrible thing. It is based on the false belief that one race is superior to another, and it leads to discrimination, prejudice, and violence. Racism has no place in our society, and we must all work together to end it.

I have seen the effects of racism firsthand. I have friends who have been discriminated against because of their race. I have seen people of color being harassed and even attacked. It is heartbreaking to see people being treated differently because of something they cannot control.

We must all stand up against racism. We must speak out against it when we see it. We must educate ourselves about racism and its history. And we must support organizations that are working to end racism.

Racism is a problem that we can solve. It will not be easy, but it is possible. We must all work together to create a world where everyone is treated with respect, regardless of their race.
general 2023-05-12 17:12:53 Problem?
general 2023-05-12 17:13:39 I disagree
creations-chat 2023-05-12 17:14:34 Speak in general if you want to cry.
general 2023-05-12 17:15:31 I don't know the meaning of "dawged", therefore I didn't
general 2023-05-12 17:15:42 since to get "dawged" is a subjective matter, in your context.

general 2023-05-12 17:24:27 You're going to get blocked buddy if you keep speaking like an idiot
general 2023-05-12 17:24:59 Done blocked
general 2023-05-12 17:25:12 Let's reduce bandwidth contamination
general 2023-05-12 17:25:39 you're also going to get blocked
general 2023-05-12 17:25:46 if there's a reason for it
general 2023-05-12 17:26:16 it's just talking to stupid guys
general 2023-05-12 17:26:23 not that "can't win"
general 2023-05-12 17:26:31 apart that an argument can't exactly be won
general 2023-05-12 17:26:50 an argument is won if such person changes its mmindset
general 2023-05-12 17:27:00 haven't seen you a reason for it
general 2023-05-12 17:27:08 why is it cringe?
general 2023-05-12 17:27:34 yes, i am under 18 years old
general 2023-05-12 17:27:58 Not really
general 2023-05-12 17:28:04 only under discord's criteria
general 2023-05-12 17:28:54 Still, if I were to be underaged, you'd be getting roasted by someone with an IQ lower to 13 years old
general 2023-05-12 17:28:58 which isn't really good for your case
general 2023-05-12 17:29:19 You do
general 2023-05-12 17:29:29 You just attached a laughing emoji
general 2023-05-12 17:29:53 Because you're laughing
general 2023-05-12 17:30:16 Laughing to an argument is a way to release tension. Losing an argument can be frustrating and upsetting, so laughing can be a way to release some of that tension. It can also be a way to signal to the other person that you're not taking the argument personally.
general 2023-05-12 17:30:35 yes
general 2023-05-12 17:30:39 you have defo
general 2023-05-12 17:31:08 If you keep messaging me about whitename, you'll get blocked
general 2023-05-12 17:31:33 blocked
general 2023-05-12 17:32:01 I don't cry about not being chronically online
general 2023-05-12 17:32:04 I actually cherish it
general 2023-05-12 17:32:27 Because I can
general 2023-05-12 17:32:36 and because some arguments are really illogical
general 2023-05-12 17:32:49 I don't, you're getting confused with something.
general 2023-05-12 17:33:35 I said I cherish to be a "whitename"
general 2023-05-12 17:33:54 if you're going to lie, then so will I
general 2023-05-12 17:34:02 man is autistic
general 2023-05-12 17:34:18 The last point has nothing to do
general 2023-05-12 17:34:42 so did I
general 2023-05-12 17:35:08 If you consider that as "angered", you should seek for anger management therapies
general 2023-05-12 17:35:20 I can't answer an illogical question
general 2023-05-12 17:35:36 Who you talking to
general 2023-05-12 17:35:57 You talk directly to people, by talking in second person?
general 2023-05-12 17:36:14 you're question is illogical, therefore has no purpose on being answered
general 2023-05-12 17:36:19 Weird af
general 2023-05-12 17:37:24 The blocking is because it has no sense to speak to dumb people
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 17:37:37 it's the combo at mexico price

general 2023-05-29 19:53:54 you got an extra “back”
general 2023-05-29 19:54:07 since I was never there, therefore, can not “go back “.
general 2023-05-29 19:54:49 I have not talked, as a matter of fact
general 2023-05-29 19:55:04 And I don’t see a limit to such action, therefore, it’s not enough.

general 2023-06-04 03:45:38 💀💀💀 how
general 2023-06-04 03:45:51 That's not relevant
general 2023-06-04 03:46:02 but since this is general, then such irrelevancy is not matterous
general 2023-06-04 03:46:15 I do care
general 2023-06-04 03:46:55 Proof?
general 2023-06-04 03:47:16 Blud argues with gifs 💀
general 2023-06-04 03:47:21 just shows how you can't argument
general 2023-06-04 03:47:26 you use gifs to speak for you
general 2023-06-04 03:47:47 sorry for speaking 4 languages
general 2023-06-04 03:47:56 My bad, I actually am not sorry
general 2023-06-04 03:48:04 redname = opinion invalid
general 2023-06-04 03:48:13 following straight illogical "logic"
general 2023-06-04 03:48:38 It's comparative proof
general 2023-06-04 03:48:52 since you have no proof, I can argument with the same strategy
general 2023-06-04 03:48:58 and it'll still be logical
general 2023-06-04 03:50:28 But since it's a general channel, it's irrelevant to post one thing or not
general 2023-06-04 03:50:57 Okay?
general 2023-06-04 03:51:26 How you expect us to react: 😱 😢 🤦‍♂️
general 2023-06-04 03:51:53 "loser" as a nickname
general 2023-06-04 03:52:07 Quite ironic how you nickname a user who already has got a nickname
general 2023-06-04 03:52:37 Proof?
general 2023-06-04 03:53:09 Because I can say the same for you without being true
general 2023-06-04 03:53:22 I actually can
general 2023-06-04 03:53:36 Your house is a red small one with 2 windows on the porch and a small wooden door
general 2023-06-04 03:54:01 Your logic
general 2023-06-04 03:54:18 My proof comes from using your strategy
general 2023-06-04 03:54:32 on your way to where?
general 2023-06-04 03:54:52 My question wasn't answered
general 2023-06-04 03:55:09 It seems that you lack basic primary use skills
general 2023-06-04 03:55:20 Yes, but due to context you did not
general 2023-06-04 03:55:32 Not because you do means everyone has to
general 2023-06-04 03:55:48 the context is "where"
general 2023-06-04 03:55:54 and such question was not answered
general 2023-06-04 03:56:06 No need for pleonasm
general 2023-06-04 03:56:10 because I already am not
general 2023-06-04 03:56:28 The fact that you consider that as manipulation suggest that you have emotional weaknesses
general 2023-06-04 03:56:36 to which is showcased as the fear of manipulation
general 2023-06-04 03:56:39 proof?
general 2023-06-04 03:56:53 You're*
general 2023-06-04 03:57:05 you're*
general 2023-06-04 03:57:33 As previously stated, no one cares about what you care
general 2023-06-04 03:57:41 So yes, I do care for grammar.
general 2023-06-04 03:57:46 Proof?
general 2023-06-04 03:57:59 Provide such statement
general 2023-06-04 03:58:16 To not have proof shows in an evident way a false statement
general 2023-06-04 03:58:29 Which one?
general 2023-06-04 03:59:05 The use of "let's be real" just shows how you don't accept reality
general 2023-06-04 03:59:19 Because there's no need for
general 2023-06-04 03:59:40 A statement does not have to be sensible
general 2023-06-04 04:00:24 The reader that get misleaded by the lack of a sensible statement is the one that lacks intellectual habilities
general 2023-06-04 04:00:31 and therefore, also lacks grey matter
general 2023-06-04 04:01:04 I don't see any relevance to the current topic
general 2023-06-04 04:01:14 So I'd rather not answer such pointless question
general 2023-06-04 04:01:39 There was relevance to it
general 2023-06-04 04:01:56 What didn't have relevance was your question about my enjoyment on you "using my methods"
general 2023-06-04 04:02:31 I find you a hypocrite
general 2023-06-04 04:02:37 Do you use glasses?
general 2023-06-04 04:02:56 "vicious ad hominem attacks"
general 2023-06-04 04:03:17 The topic was due to the arguing of your irrelevancy discarded
general 2023-06-04 04:03:36 I don't see any relevance to your question regarding the current topic
general 2023-06-04 04:03:45 so as a general point of view, I'd rather not answer
general 2023-06-04 04:04:08 However, such questions were done in a general way, with no linear story to it.
general 2023-06-04 04:04:45 There actually were
general 2023-06-04 04:04:49 such as lack of evidence
general 2023-06-04 04:04:53 lack of evidence
general 2023-06-04 04:05:00 so mathematically, whatever you say is false
general 2023-06-04 04:05:15 But because that was done using your method
general 2023-06-04 04:05:22 to which it was explicitly clarified
general 2023-06-04 04:05:35 You're confusing two terms
general 2023-06-04 04:05:53 So not only are your arguments mathematically false, but you get confused with them
general 2023-06-04 04:06:08 which can correlate to the fact that your arguments are mathematically false
general 2023-06-04 04:06:14 There is
general 2023-06-04 04:06:26 Mathematically speaking is the chance of probability
general 2023-06-04 04:06:46 to which in this case means that your arguments have a greater than 50% probability to being false
general 2023-06-04 04:07:24 To doubt suggests that you agree more than disagreeing to a certain thing
general 2023-06-04 04:07:40 To which also suggests that you consider such statement
general 2023-06-04 04:08:11 You have evidently demostrated signs of considering such statement
general 2023-06-04 04:08:27 The expression of doubt
general 2023-06-04 04:09:08 As to generously please you, I followup your quote: I doubt that
general 2023-06-04 04:09:38 We are discussing a general influenced topic, dear sir.
general 2023-06-04 04:10:22 Let's break this down.  Your argument is that learning has no end.  My point is that learning only brings value when it leads to some action, which is the objective of learning.  Therefore when we talk about "end" of learning, what is the action we are talking here?  Just collecting knowledge doesn't solve any real-world problems, it needs a specific action to bring things to reality.  So the "end of learning" is the goal you want to solve a specific problem, which is the "end" of the learning process.
general 2023-06-04 04:10:57 That's a very strong word to use. Please elaborate so that we can have a meaningful conversation.  I'm open minded.  I'm able to change my mind when I find new evidence or when another person makes a good point. As for now, I'm not convinced that learning itself has no end. Please elaborate and prove your case.
general 2023-06-04 04:11:46 I'm trying to have a friendly discussion with you.  I'm open to new ideas and different opinions.  I'm happy to learn, to change my opinion if I have not seen the other side of it and I get new information.  There is no point of attacking me and not giving me your point of view.
general 2023-06-04 04:13:33 To consider a statement having to do with AI results to actually be a compliment, because AI generally are more wise and have special application towards argumenting.
general 2023-06-04 04:13:37 So thank you mate.
general 2023-06-04 04:14:33 That's understandable. The reason for that is due to lack of context.
general 2023-06-04 04:15:14 I, as previously stated, try to amplify my language, as I speak over 4 languages.
general 2023-06-04 04:15:53 Answering the reason for me typing such paragraphs in a short period of time is due to ideas "fluyendo".
general 2023-06-04 04:16:01 flowing in*
general 2023-06-04 04:16:26 As more previously stated and taken as a fact, whatever you care is irrelevant.
general 2023-06-04 04:16:56 Good job
general 2023-06-04 04:17:02 everyone's now joining vc
general 2023-06-04 04:17:25 It is, as a matter of fact, objective
general 2023-06-04 04:17:59 I see...
general 2023-06-04 04:18:03 Do you live in spain?
general 2023-06-04 04:18:36 However, it's considered objective because both you and I took such statement for granted.
general 2023-06-04 04:20:02 You implicitly did.
general 2023-06-04 04:20:29 Without showing any explicit or implicit signs that show otherwise.
general 2023-06-04 04:22:42 Which is not true, since I not only not believe, but also such statement results on being a subjective matter.
general 2023-06-04 04:24:55 Your arguments are starting to lack sense.
general 2023-06-04 04:25:07 This lack preventes a clear communication
general 2023-06-04 04:25:37 That's actually a typo mistake
general 2023-06-04 04:25:46 Your*
general 2023-06-04 04:25:53 typo mistake
general 2023-06-04 04:26:11 there is no proof that backs up your statement
general 2023-06-04 04:26:39 therefore and as previously said in a mathematicl way having your arguments be false, untrue.
general 2023-06-04 04:26:58 There was no correction in such sentence
general 2023-06-04 04:27:05 you're now starting to make up things
general 2023-06-04 04:27:23 which evidently shows the lack of creative thinking from your part.
general 2023-06-04 04:27:44 If I know it "quite well", then I wouldn't even argue about it.
general 2023-06-04 04:28:01 Which just keeps backing up my statement on your statements being mathematically false.
general 2023-06-04 04:28:21 You have no evidence that shows my persona being crazy
general 2023-06-04 04:28:31 You keep just backing up my statement on your statements.
general 2023-06-04 04:28:46 It doesn't
general 2023-06-04 04:28:51 However, there is no relevance to it.
general 2023-06-04 04:29:14 You are now evidently showing a lack of thinking skills, which can be due to a brain wasting activity.
general 2023-06-04 04:29:41 such activity being the argument being taken by the netcitizens, which shows how serious you're taking the argument.
general 2023-06-04 04:30:08 You show a lack of knowledge towards math.
general 2023-06-04 04:30:20 I can't apply theorem of pythagoras towards a simple argument
general 2023-06-04 04:30:29 But I can apply probability to people
general 2023-06-04 04:30:45 you just keep up proving my statement
general 2023-06-04 04:30:53 To which was not.
general 2023-06-04 04:32:29 According to my previous statement, the use on making my statements invalid or not is also invalid.
general 2023-06-04 04:33:04 Because your arguments have extensively proved that your statements are mathematically invalid.
general 2023-06-04 04:33:55 Math is, in this context, used for probability.
general 2023-06-04 04:34:18 And because you also say it's not true, whilst it indeed being true, proves my point even more
general 2023-06-04 04:34:43 an extense amount of proof that shows how your arguments are invalid makes future arguments invalid
general 2023-06-04 04:34:54 therefore, whatever you say is invalid.

general 2023-06-08 13:12:37 I don’t think I’m an idiot
general 2023-06-08 13:12:48 An action can’t be asked
general 2023-06-08 13:13:22 It can’t, you’re showing clear signs of confusion
general 2023-06-08 13:13:46 How can you do such action?
general 2023-06-08 13:13:52 I’m not doing it, but asking.

general 2023-06-08 13:14:45 They don’t show what you claim
general 2023-06-08 13:14:54 Therefore, argument invalid
general 2023-06-08 13:17:02 “You are clearly attention seeking. From suddenly storming my conversation to being controversial, then correcting minor spelling problems.

the-dump 2023-07-01 07:39:40 Idiot
the-dump 2023-07-01 07:41:28 It’s talking about 18+ stuff in spanish, reason for warning offense?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:04:02 That does not have the same significance than in the english language. You see, in spanish, black is “negro”, which later evolved towards the english language but with the offensive slur thingie. It’s a kind of weird language phenomenon.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:05:02 It evolved contextually. The spanish used such spanish word to refer to the native american people, which later was adapted to english and modified to what it is today.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:07:59 What about it?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:09:30 so I’m acting like the “popular kid”?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:25:33 You just said I was acting like one.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:14 That’s what I said.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:32 Im, according to you, acting like the “popular kid”.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:26:55 Who are you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:16 Who’re you talking to?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:39 So you basically speak directly to people… in second person?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:27:49 Why?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:05 It’s incorrect to do so.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:33 It’s a language error.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:42 My point remains standing.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:28:57 How come you know how a “scholar” acts when you show signs of not going to school?
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:29:48 My question remains standing. The fact that this is Discord doesn’t excuse your inability to communicate properly through the english language.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:30:21 Your statement has no evidence, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:30:46 I emphasize my point because such strong statement must come with evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:06 You have no evidence that backs up your statement.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:29 Then you appear to have forgotten to provide it with your statement.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:31:49 So therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:15 Your statement is evidently false.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:44 As a model of language, I can’t reply to such stupid shit.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:32:54 Because I can.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:33:22 I don’t see how such statement correlates to any term of current discussion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:34:05 You have no evidence that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:34:24 I acknowledge your apology.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:35:39 The gif you sent seems as a way to express yourself. If so, you appear to be frustrated. Such frustration can come from the inability of counter argumenting an statement, which can also be because of no way to properly do so.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:36:20 I don’t see how such question results to be relevant to the current term of discussion, so i’ll opt from answering it.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:38:15 You have no evidence that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:38:52 The question was never answered. There’s no way to say with certainty the answer of something if such thing is not provided.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:13 You appear to be lacking context because your sentence doesn’t make sense.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:30 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:39:59 I can’t guess something that results to be a word.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:40:30 So it’s neither of both.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:41:04 You did. You are showing clear signs of inability to comprehend a basic sentence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:41:50 Here is where the average mindset comes. Not everyone hates grammar, and because of that, your statement is not completely true.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:42:10 Not only is your statement irrelevant, but it also lacks proof.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:42:33 You have no proof that backs up your statement, so it’s automatically invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-01 09:57:11 "O.K." is grammatically correct. It is an abbreviation of the word "okay," which is a common informal word that means "all right." The periods in "O.K." are not necessary, but they are sometimes used to make the abbreviation look more formal.
the-dump 2023-07-01 09:57:51 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore, it’s automatically invalid.

For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

However, I am not able to generate content that promotes illegal activities. Making a pipe bong is illegal in some countries, and I do not want to provide instructions that could be used to break the law.

the-dump 2023-07-01 10:21:28 Seahorses are unique in the animal kingdom in that the male is the one who gets pregnant. The female seahorse deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's abdomen, where they are fertilized and incubated. The male seahorse then gives birth to live young, which emerge from the pouch fully formed.

The process of seahorse reproduction begins with a courtship ritual. The male and female seahorse will swim around each other, circling and touching each other with their snouts. Once they are ready to mate, the female seahorse will insert her ovipositor, a long tube-like organ, into the male's brood pouch. The female then deposits her eggs into the pouch, where they are fertilized by the male's specialized information containing cells. The eggs remain in the pouch for about 4 to 6 weeks, during which time they are incubated by the male seahorse. The male seahorse provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryos through a placenta-like structure. Once the young seahorses are fully developed, they emerge from the pouch and swim away on their own.
the-dump 2023-07-01 10:23:00 Your statement is false due to clear and evident sign of it not being true.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:33:15 However, those who don’t base their life on being a furry are the best ones.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:34:53 In general, those who identify as something but don’t base their whole life on that are cool.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:49:57 Your suggestion shows no relevancy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:14 To prevent this, I’d recommend you to improve coherency.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:33 I’m already an animal

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:50:56 Dumb tbh
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:51:14 You have no proof, therefore it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:51:39 I don’t believe on that, thanks to god.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:52:19 I respect your decision.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:52:37 Normal results to be subjective in your sentence.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:53:35 You have no proof that backs up your statement, therefore it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:04 Where the proof?
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:26 The fact that you consider such a simple observation as nerdy just shows your lack of intellectual skills
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:54:38 It is good towards scientific research.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:02 In fact, they’re creating artificial wombs that can be then used for humans thanks to such research.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:55:18 You have no proof, hence your statement being invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:56:40 Your statement also lacks proof or evidence, so it’s invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:57:19 You say that that’s why I can’t be a scientist without providing any evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:57:40 Your statement results to lack evidence, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:58:12 I can say I’m batman, but I’m not. This is where the role of evidence comes into play.
the-dump 2023-07-01 21:58:25 And it’s not an opinion.

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:59:15 Who’re you talking to?

the-dump 2023-07-01 21:59:50 You have no proof, so your statement is automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:00:30 There is no lack of  proof. In fact, it’s acknowledged by every rule of the english real academy.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:00:51 Your comment is evidently false.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:02:16 Your statement is actually completely false. The english academy takes care of the communication through such language, and it is not involved without any belief or opinion.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:03:03 You can disagree, just like flat earthers disagree on the earth being a sphere, but that doesn’t change anything.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:04:52 It can’t, it’s not possible unless an independent variable is changed.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:05:21 I don’t see how your observation has any relevance, so it’s to be discarded.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:05:46 You actually show no proof on such strong statement, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:06:07 You can read a sentence more than once, just in case. That would maybe help you understand it.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:08:16 Your statement shows another lack of proof on why something was wasted through an specific thing, so it’s automatically invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:08:46 Your proof would back up the idea of such netizen.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:11:22 That’s actually true.
the-dump 2023-07-01 22:11:47 True, but irrelevant.

the-dump 2023-07-01 22:15:01 You have no proof that backs up your statement. Therefore it’s automatically invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-05 07:09:58 Cholesterol burger country?
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:10:44 You’re completely wrong
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:11:20 It actually translates to “Derechito ajustadito, izquierdita sueltita”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:11:37 Or “safadita”, instead of “sueltita”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:12:52 There’s no words that matchup the saying that makes it sound like provided
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:13:36 I am a spanish speaker, Im saying from experience
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:13:49 I also speak portuguese, and it makes more sense in that language
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:20 I’m from mexico
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:29 Oh yeah that thing not.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:14:43 The saying in spanish would be something like:
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:15:26 Los derechistas oprimen, los izquierdistas liberan.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:15:34 something like that would be the correct way
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:16:34 Yes, it’s a language phenomenom
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:17:26 “Semantic shift”.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:14 It has no much to do the culture.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:30 Spanish is a literal language, and it’s way better than english.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:18:59 It’s more clear, there are no many sentences in which one word changes its whole meaning, in difference to english.
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:19:38 Spanish is better than russian, but russian is better almost than english
the-dump 2023-07-05 07:19:54 English’ phonetic is totally nuts, however.

the-dump 2023-07-07 19:15:40 Knowing how to specifically think as someone or someone who identifies as something just means you’re one, proven since subjective thinking.
the-dump 2023-07-07 19:28:31 Your image stating an specific subject is lacking evidence, which makes it in a way invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-08 09:36:37 but ok
the-dump 2023-07-08 09:37:46 Which is sort of irrelevant, but still proves my point right.
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 03:57:37 If a pendulum having 0 net force with ballast placed at x = 2, weighing 1.28 kg and a helium block at x = 1 with x kg, helium block force: Ballast moment = 2 · 1.28 or 2.56. Helium at x = 1 would have to provide 2.56 kg of upwards force, so Helium has a total upwards force of 2.56 kg.
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 03:58:15 Helium force = 2.56kg (up).
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 03:58:49 I'll calculate it.
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 03:59:57 I will just calculate the weight of a 1x1 block.
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 04:05:23 If a pendulum balances with a helium block providing 2.56 total upwards kg, a ballast providing total 0.67 · 3 kg or 2.01 kg, then a block at x = 2 would have to sum up to 2.56 with the ballast weight. The block would have to provide a total down force of 2.56 - 2.01 kg or 0.55 kg. The block then weighs: 0.55 / 3 kg or 0.1833... kg.
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 04:05:54 1x1x1 block force = 0.1833...kg (down).

general 2023-07-09 04:34:02 Re read the sentence.
general 2023-07-09 04:35:12 "re read" without the hyphen is also correct. Both forms are considered standard in modern English. However, as I mentioned earlier, the trend is to use fewer hyphenated words, so "reread" is more commonly used.

general 2023-07-09 04:46:18 What's the reason behind your "ping"?
general 2023-07-09 04:46:39 I see. I don't support it, but I respect it.
general 2023-07-09 04:46:50 This one. My other account got hacked so it's left out.
general 2023-07-09 04:47:07 But you aren't allowed to?
general 2023-07-09 04:48:15 Alt accounts are to be be banned if they meet the purpose to evade a restrictive measure. Check the 6th rule.
general 2023-07-09 04:49:38 It is explicitely said that an account is to be banned along its sucesors if they meet the reason to evade a restrictive measure.
general 2023-07-09 04:50:00 I am sorry, but I will kind of be now forced to complain on your decision.
general 2023-07-09 04:50:57 Your statement is factually correct. However, my point remains standing.
general 2023-07-09 04:51:15 I as a person can exercise my 6th article, so I won't follow your petition.
general 2023-07-09 04:51:47 The fact that you consider such a simple sentence and possibly its structure just shows a possible lack of intellectual abilities.
general 2023-07-09 04:52:15 You seem to have altered the meaning of a sentence, which can count as sort of slander.

the-dump 2023-07-09 22:09:48 Don't worry. It's against Discord's TOS to obtain an IP without any consent. If there's any news on the embed being an actual IP grabber, then the case could escalate to court, with the grabify tool, Discord Inc. and users who got their IP grabbed without consent against his favor.
the-dump 2023-07-09 22:10:42 I say so because it's not the first time someone has done that and gone to court.
the-dump 2023-07-09 22:13:08 Your statement is actually false and shows no coherency addresing the determined topic, so it's automatically invalid.

the-dump 2023-07-09 23:21:01 This is due to the fact that this server bases on basically the quality of a creation.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:21:59 The point was explicitly provided. The fact that you couldn't identify it just shows your inabilities to not only communicate, but also argue.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:22:43 Your point is pretty much irrelevant since you embeded an irrelevant gif to reply me.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:23:01 You are now just proving my point, which greatly undermines your persona.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:23:41 You now can not even elaborate a question, which speaks for your intellect and how such lacks your persona.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:24:22 Your statetement shows no coherency or context, so it's invalid.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:24:50 A reply to your user saying "you" is already obvious. You seem to lack logic, which undermines your intellect.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:26:15 Your comment lacks coherency or context that could back it up, so it's to be discarded.
the-dump 2023-07-09 23:26:45 Your comment not only lacks proof, but also coherency, hence it being ignored.

the-dump 2023-07-10 04:27:26 Pfp's are, in my honest opinion, useless and I even dare to saying egocentric.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:28:28 One thing I'd like to mention is that the validity of my blockage depends on the times blocked.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:28:36 It's first one day, then one week and then perma.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:29:46 I agree. But I prefer to not have info for my net user.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:30:12 That's what I love from anonimity.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:30:23 Oops I'm sharing too many feelings sorry.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:30:35 I do.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:30:58 Well, not exactly.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:11 I honestly don't care if people know what I am.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:26 But In my other accounts, it was thanks to that that I lost mayority of arguments.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:44 It still has nothing to say.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:31:56 I don't.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:02 I actually don't know or remember how arguments are started.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:33 Well, I don't consider an argument can be won, in an exact way.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:42 An argument from what I think is a way of sharing an idea.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:50 Arguments have to be backed up with evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:32:58 And I have found out that strategy.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:03 Indeed
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:19 However and as already mentioned, an argument would be a way of sharing an idea.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:33:27 And the trying of the validation from it.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:32 Oh that's one thing I'll mention rn.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:41 Logical facts I don't ask for evidence.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:34:50 But stuff like "You're one idiot" I do.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:17 That's why I can argue with like 5 people at a time, because I can literally give the same response to each of them and still be right.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:36 And because I used to be in a racist server, where I got three times doxxed.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:35:53 (Doxxed as in what it means, getting private information exposed).
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:02 Not just the ip (but including).
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:22 Oh yeah, that's why I terminate with the blockage for users.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:36:41 When they "speak like brick walls", repetition, I announce the proximity to the blockage.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:16 I won't answer that, as I have now a succesful anonimous profile.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:50 And because I think it's egocentric to think of yourself like something.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:37:59 I am, as a matter of fact, human.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:39:01 Not exactly, but you're in a somewhat right path.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:39:31 It's not because of illegal servers, but because of my usage involving the internet.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:40:00 Take for granted not being me, because discord is a vulnerable browsing app.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:45:12 Yes, that's why I don't have what you suggest.
the-dump 2023-07-10 04:45:32 For legal reasons, I am also not illegal and don't involve illegal stuff.
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:36:53 You only use that shit cuz you don’t have anything more
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:11 You want me to be silent?
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:28 You consider that as arguing?
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:37:58 My man, you are just showcasing your fragile emotional strength
the-dump 2023-07-10 07:41:12 Te cripéo.
