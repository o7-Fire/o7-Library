Cuz more offset parts and more shit for the shitty game engine to calculate. (Pov: doesn't know a flying fuck about how code in physics engines work)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:45:34 Thanks for support and constructive feedback. I can also show you the amount of pistons that i have remaining, which is 947, which you can substract from 999 to get 52 :). ‚ù§Ô∏è it's not that bad but okay, keep hating ü§£
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:48:02 And why u hating me when builds like this exost
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:50:24 Legacies are way simpler, less angles on the wings, elevators, etc. His livery is also less complex than mine. But hey thanks for constructive criticism and helping new PC players improve their building skills ‚ù§Ô∏è
creations-chat 2023-04-01 01:52:30 I never defended it,and out of nowhere says it's a piece of shit. Fucking idiot. I fixed the issue you pointed out in my build

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:12:14 Ya I changed the wings, they have an angle at the back. U just smoking bad zaza. I understand why u think there isn't an angle tho. My pictures don't show a clear top down view
