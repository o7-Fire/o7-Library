help 2022-02-27 02:23:35 why do you need a rank in order to make a suggestion? i know it's to verify is the person is valid and dedicated to the game, but the requirements seem a bit too much, especially if you're someone like me who just wants to suggest cones be added so i can make a somewhat physically accurate train
help 2022-02-27 03:04:33 i mean would it work as wheels?
help 2022-02-27 03:05:02 especially with the tracks in the way and the placement of the motor, i'm not sure if it would work
help 2022-02-27 03:05:28 and also why would i need skill if the object was right there?
help 2022-02-27 03:06:20 even if it's possible, it still wouldn't be easy nor would it be efficient, even though the cones are provided in the editor
help 2022-02-27 09:07:05 please follow the rules and don't be rude. i try not to myself, so can you try to be nice as well? not to mention i still need to get good myself, so can you help me?
help 2022-02-27 09:09:35 can the rules be changed so that's the exception?
help 2022-02-27 09:21:51 <@!744591826891046943>?
help 2022-02-27 09:23:13 not sure how, sorry!
