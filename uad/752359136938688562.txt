general 2023-02-12 07:24:56 I’ve always wondered, but why do some people hate non motorlocked builds 🗿

general 2023-02-13 07:17:08 Dislocation sucks
general 2023-02-13 07:18:00 I've always been curious, but why are people such fanatics about motorlocking? (I've never motorlocked a build before)
general 2023-02-13 07:18:38 Oh
general 2023-02-13 07:18:49 I've just seen people get angry over a non-motorlocked one
