plane-crazy 2023-07-03 17:36:59 I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 17:37:07 because ksp physics are also really wonky
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 17:37:47 yea normally if you attached a rocket engine to a block in plane crazy it flies forward
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 17:37:51 But in fp
