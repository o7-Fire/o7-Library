plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:19:06 can you use motor 2's for rotational angle locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:20:20 nvm
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:01 It is working on the jet I am building it is a lot easier to set the angle than to use piston and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:10 it works sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:25:28 it doesn't work all the time
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:27:44 that takes a while though
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:30:28 look up a video on how to magnet lock

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:31:14 almost 4
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:36:04 magnet lock seems like a pain in the butt

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 14:38:56 wong video

plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:00:16 it is not a problem if that is how the actual plane looks
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:03:57 nahhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:04:20 shredders aren't even good
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 15:04:45 they are only good for ground targets
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 20:23:58 what to use instead of tnt for motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-01-08 20:24:26 how does psring work

creations-chat 2023-07-13 15:06:52 You don't real need all those control surfaces. If you replaced them with trapdoors or disconnectors it would turn better and look better
