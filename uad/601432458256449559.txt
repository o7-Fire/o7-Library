creations-chat 2021-08-28 16:04:28 people shouldnt follow tutorials unless is to actually learn a technique (like motorlock or tonk wheels) People should be original and unique (edit, happeh now?)

creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:30:09 haha gatling gun go brr
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:33:38 1- why do people hate some nice builds its just that they are jealous or something? I mean there are better ones but they dont look that bad.

2- I dont think that doodle wanted to advertise his channel, just wanted to get his plane seen
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:36:31 He just has the verified role. That role cant send images nor gifs i believe as I couldnt send with that role.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:39:27 It looks nice to me, i mean i make boats and blimps idk about helicopters. Also <@782046859819876384>  (srry for ping) have you seen a player called grandma before in plane crazy? I think we have met before.
creations-chat 2021-08-28 22:41:32 Then its an empacho lol. I still think it doesnt look that bad, I mean some helicopters are hard to make.
