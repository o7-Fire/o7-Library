contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:27:20 Infinity isn’t a number
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:28:57 It’s an idea
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:33:06 But a number tells you the exact quantity of something, infinity only tells you that something is without ending, not the exact amount, therefore it’s not a number
contest-chat 2023-02-21 19:38:00 But infinity can be used outside of numbers, so it shouldn’t be a number
