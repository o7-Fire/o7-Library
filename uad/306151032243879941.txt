help 2021-11-12 17:43:54 Hello. Is there any guide on how to use suspensions instead of motorlock to compress your build?
help 2021-11-12 17:45:51 is there a way to make it stable/locked?
help 2021-11-12 17:48:27 i wish i wouldn't have to the problem is that i've ran out of motors
help 2021-11-12 17:55:20 well seems making a giant fully custom angled creations is not motor's count supported
help 2021-11-12 18:08:47 yeah my hopes are in that
help 2021-11-12 20:32:08 i'm building fully custom angled 1:1 size model of tu-160
help 2021-11-12 20:32:49 they are limited to 1x4
help 2021-11-12 20:37:58 i think its a bit complicated to understand it
help 2021-11-12 20:40:09 all depends on how detailed you want it to be
help 2021-11-12 20:42:37 also it wouldn't need most of it if baseplate's surface was enough for its dimensions
help 2021-11-12 20:57:03 
help 2021-11-12 20:58:34 
help 2021-11-12 21:02:52 I mean the main motor requirement is fit the whole thing inside the plot
help 2021-11-12 21:03:24 than fold it and compress parts into their position
