plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:51:34 it's because of how supersonic air works
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:51:43 when air is subsonic, making a smaller opening makes it go faster
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:51:56 when it's supersonic, having a bigger opening makes it go faster
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:52:06 so why not have b o t h
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 21:52:25 that's why rocket nozzles are shaped like bells

creations-chat 2019-12-15 01:49:15 <@!437078588701933568> If you want me to show it I will. Same concept (has helicopter blades but flies as a plane) but 2 main differences: 1: This is oc and his is a replica, and 2: mine is M E G A scuffed (it was something i put together in about 2 minutes)
plane-crazy 2019-12-15 01:51:57 If anyone can guess what this is before I'm finished i'll give you a cookie

plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:52:52 w a i t
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:53:43 also I've just realized how magnet blocks work and have a devilish idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 19:54:06 Perhaps I could mount a mag cannon on a plane?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:01:29 there's a loose parts only setting on the magnet
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 20:01:37 so it wouldn't affect the plane itself

plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:38:59 I already did, look in creations (it's a model tho)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:39:42 I really just wanted to see what would occur if I mounted a gun on a plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:39:51 it has a 10 round magazine just for lulz
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:41:58 the only problem with it is feeding issues, and you just jostle it a bit and it will work
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:42:11 (and of course the toaster killing power of 10 balls at 600 SPS)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:43:07 it does but the wings are powerful enough to counteract it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:43:42 still don't know wth a conveyor engine is
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:21 I'm guessing it's two conveyors with the moving part put on each other?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:51:26 y'all be talking about reaching ridiculous speeds with these drives when IDK how to even build one

plane-crazy 2019-12-19 22:37:32 I think conveyor engines work in any orientation

creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:00 shot from the rear
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:25 it's mostly because the wings were stubby
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:08:35 I probably could've used wings now that I think about it
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:30 on the F-15 ACTIVE there's a tiny winglet on the front that helps with STOL
creations-chat 2019-12-20 03:09:42 so having them start on the intakes simply isn't feasable

plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:32 so I saw the floating fortress role
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:37 and I have an idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:16:48 does the fortress have to float on water?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:00 the entire point of having multiple cores is so that your cores don't have to run at 9 million GHZ
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:50 It's because of heat problems
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 02:19:59 the faster cores run, the hotter they get
creations-chat 2019-12-22 17:32:52 arabic

plane-crazy 2019-12-22 19:01:59 *moment of realization*
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 19:02:09 I am deeply humiliated and shall now go kill ms
creations-chat 2019-12-25 19:40:57 people are a bit too dislike happy though
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:40:50 Turret for a ship that will never be because I'm lazy and can't fold
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:41:39 yes
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:42:12 that's because both of those cannons are magnetic accelerators
they fire explosive balls of death and have a magazine of 3 balls each
creations-chat 2020-04-13 21:42:38 I'm suprised I could make a MAC that small
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:48:26 conveyor drives are kinda simple
you push a conveyor with nothing above it with a piston into a position where there is someting attached to your ship above it *i.e half blocc*
the conveyor drives against the half block and pushes the piston, which pushes it back.
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:49:10 magnet drives MEGA lag tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:47 drag makes that impossible
but your best bet is still a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:55 they get like 5k speed
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:50:59 for a simple one
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:51:09 why would a conveyor drive buckle
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:51:56 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:52:07 my classic builds usually make it to 5.5k
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:38 magnetic magazine systems
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 21:59:42 I've made a couple of them
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:00:28 crap gif of mine
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:01:48 picture of "internals"
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:02:34 better picture of internals
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:03:19 about conveyor drive races
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:14 it's extremely unstable while active
but the aircraft itself actually is stable in regular flight
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:04:26 just a slight pitchup tendency
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:05:16 if you look closely between the engine nacelles you can see the drive in action in the gif
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:07:30 you could definitely fit a conveyor drive in that thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:08:34 in the middle of the chassis
all you need it a 1x4x2 space
plane-crazy 2020-04-13 22:10:05 literally all you need
creations-chat 2020-04-13 22:13:47 I remember having that aircapture idea when I was trying to build a sky carrier a while back
creations-chat 2020-04-13 22:14:04 at least I have proof it works now, because that carrier never materialized
creations-chat 2020-04-14 15:34:07 How to get likes with creations is a mystery
creations-chat 2020-04-14 15:46:57 autoloading MAC concept
because having two rounds in the cannon at the same time is annoying
i might use this in other designs, who knows
creations-chat 2020-04-14 22:37:15 hey, remember when I said I would never make a ship for the chonky gun
i lied
my first truly giant build, it has a 90 degree fold and consists of about 1.7k blocks
detail is a bit sparse, but that can be fixed later
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:43:35 your props are all in the same direction, causing you to yaw harshly right
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:43:55 reverse the direction of two opposite props, and you should be fine
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 23:44:22 any ones, as long as they are opposite sides to each other
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:08:20 tbh I can't tell what gets you upvoted and what gets you downvoted at this point
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:09:07 "hey look a uboat, let's give it 10 downvotes"
"hey look another uboat, let's give it 23 upvotes"
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:09:09 like what
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:12:16 My boat has like 27 downvotes even though it was my most ambitious build yet (I'm still slightly salty)
and then my Pixy Morgan replica which only took an hour to do got 20 upvotes
like what do you want JUST TELL ME
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:13:15 however I did notice I forgot to paint a block on the boat
reee
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:13:42 it was also boxy because it was my first fold
plenty of things I could fix up
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:14:29 yeah I'm pretty sure I got a negative vote average and then snowballed
but that might be me just being salty
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:15:51 I think you can still see it on creations if you scroll far enough up
it was above the M4 sherman that had 8 pics posted
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:16:56 yeah my best build ever was a ADFX-1 replica and that was about 400 blocks
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:17:26 *and there's my problem*
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:17:52 it does look ugly
but it was built a bit more for function than form
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:18:18 that big cannon on the front can actually fire
the ship was built around that
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:21:00 let's end this on a good note
I'm thinking that a tank would be good to make next, and I think I will incorporate my autoloading system into it
creations-chat 2020-04-15 14:21:12 it will be my first foray into rope tracks though
creations-chat 2020-04-15 15:39:45 This aircraft carrier is right under the 2000 block limit to compete for floating fortress

creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:00:03 The vast majority of the block count is dedicated to the wingspan

creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:01:09 Well
creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:01:20 The entire spiel of the arsenal bird is that the thing is white
creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:01:29 so I can't really paint it, per say
creations-chat 2020-06-08 20:01:46 I could go ahead and paint the DCs and motors

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:40:46 we go again
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:41:23 you're right

plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:42:51 .-.
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:43:45 i'll look back in about 2 days and it'll have 69 upvotes and 60 downvotes
it's cursed
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:44:05 turn down torque my guy
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:44:27 like 1 digit
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:15 oh improve the handling of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:16 ah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:31 there's a couple of ways to do that
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:45:55 that's a symptom of every plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:07 but in planes you want to balance three forces
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:13 the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:15 the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:21 and the center of thrust
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:45 it has no indicator in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:46:51 but yeah just look at the engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:08 a pitchup/down tendency can be caused by placing them really high up
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:40 it can be compensated for
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:47:54 but you need to know that the engine placement affects things
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:48:02 oh that doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 21:48:05 unless its a vtol
creations-chat 2020-06-08 21:49:43 <:what:644996672048463942>

general 2022-07-09 20:21:09 hello
help 2022-08-20 03:37:58 do we got big brained mfs in here because I need help
I'm trying to get a cyclorotor assembly to produce lateral lift, but the ways I have tried doing it so far has caused unwanted vertical lift as described by this shitty ms paint drawing
should I try out a gimbal, or some completely different strategy to achieve the lateral lift without impacting the vertical lift of the rotor?
